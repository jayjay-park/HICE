3957140,0,t1_cr76se5,Because they are evil. I do not throw that word around lightly.Let me tell you a funny anecdote. Two years ago I read an article about a woman who had gotten a new job. It was a great job and she just had one small issue. She asked  asked not demanded  if she could leave work a few hours early one day a week so she could meet her autistic son on his early dismissal day. She wanted to work from home in the afternoon that day or perhaps come in a couple of hours earlier and make up the time that way. For simply asking if this was a possibility they rescinded the job offer.I posted this story on my blog and asked some real life friends this question Which notforprofit is involved here?Obviously you know because I wouldnt tell this story without a point but they didnt have the hints you did I just dropped this subject in out of nowhere. Would you believe that out of the twentyfive people I asked every single one of them got it right on the first try?Do you know why? Because its always freaking Autism Speaks! When you hear that a kindergarten teacher led the class in voting out an autistic student do you know which is the sole autism organization not to condemn this behavior? Autism Speaks! When you hear that a facility in the US has been condemned by the UN for shocking its residents do you know which is the sole autism organization to recommend this facility to parents? Autism Speaks! When you hear that one organization gives its board members a higher salary than comparable organizations and in fact gave them a raise in the middle of a recession when similar organizations were cutting their costs which organization is that? Autism Speaks! Im not even mentioning the Autism Every Day debacle.  In the wake of that little film two autistic children were murdered by their parents in the US Christopher DeGroot and Katie McCarron. Christophers parents locked him in his room and set the house on fire. They didnt serve any prison time. Given that the film shows a mother stating in front of her verbal autistic daughter that the only thing that has kept her from killing herself and that daughter is thoughts of what it would do to her NT daughter which is tacky if nothing else the whole situation was a public relations disaster. And do you know what their response was? Every parent of a child with autism secretly wants their child dead.Bullshit. I have been following news stories about Autism Speaks since they arrived on the scene. Not once in ten years have they not been utterly and totally in the wrong. Thats an impressive track record. Im dead serious Id sooner give all my money to the Scientologists and go live as a clown than let one penny of mine enter Autism Speaks grubby little pockets.If you want to donate to an autism related organization I suggest either the Autism Self Advocacy Network or the Autism Society of America.,USNEWS,cr7ciyb,5,t5_2qlab
3963699,1,t1_cr81t3m,You can internalize racist things and not realize they are racist.Just like you can walk around calling uncool things gay without holding malice towards gays. In your mind they might be two completely different and unrelated words. But its still shitty to take a group of people and use them as a label for something negative. If you started calling those things Steve from now on you might have no problem with any Steves and you might not care if one moved into your neighborhood but ask Steve and he will be like Could you not call shitty things Steve?On the other hand I still dont think the Redskins name is racist for the same reason I dont find the Minnesota Vikings anti Swede.

4452939,0,t1_csry8r8,Im from Europe here we arent as up the butt about sex as in the US. We dont see sex as something special or odd. And in school at ages of  and  there is some time spent on sex education eventhough in total its certainly less than  hours but its enough. At  cartoons of sex are shown. At  nudes bodies are shown which is unneeded as like  already knowns what nude people look like by then lol.I really dont understand all the fuzz people make about sex. The most well educated children Ive seen of who I think their parents done a great job raising their children were educated about sex at an early age not the full storry at once of course.As a comparison. There are parents who teach their children about  for example not following a stranger for icecream and making their children understand that some people COULD have bad intentions not just say not to accept anything of strangers without telling them why to protect them from the truth or making them scared of ALL strangers is also very bad. On the other side there are overprotective parents that do not teach their children anything like this as they dont want their children to know there are bad people to protect them and will just constantly keep their children on an extremely short leash and will not let them go anywhere alone. Those children then become easy prey to for example a pedophile as those children arent educated at all.With sex its similar like that. You can pretend it doesnt exist but that only makes your children more vulnerable. While sex at arround y old aint that rare which is obviously extremely bad if they dont even know they can get pregnant of it and dont understand what pregnancy amp parenthood encompass!,USNEWS,csrz6ms,1,t5_2qlab

5013372,0,t1_cuqastd,That trend is likely to continue as more of our online time shifts to smartphones where Google and Facebook combine to make an estimated nearly  percent of all the advertising revenue on the planet Earth. Local news sites are disproportionately likely to be clunky and slow a real issue on mobile devices and they generally have terrible technology for targeting ads at readers.Lost in a quest for scaleHere is a telling quote from Michael Finnegan chief financial officer of Atlantic Media  a company that has negotiated the transition from print to digital about as well as anyone. Hes talking about the possibilities of a platformdriven world where Facebook Google and perhaps a few others control even more of the means of distributionLets say we reach  to  million people through owned and operated sites today. Five years from now our brands could be reaching  to  million worldwide but not if we insist that all of them have to interact with us on our terms on our site. Thats the future I see. Thats the future a lot of major media companies see. Some of them are running towards it faster than others.That may be a perfectly wonderful future for Atlantic Media! But its hardly one available to most local news organizations who continue to see their traditional readership fade and few good ways to monetize the one that might replace it.There was a vision of the Internet in the late s and early s that imagined that the little guys could be winners. Reaching an audience would no longer mean owning a printing press or an FCC license  it would simply mean posting to the web using free or cheap tools and letting the Internets power to connect audiences and publishers do the rest. A tiny blog could be as powerful as a giant media company!But the story of the web in  is very nearly the Bizarro World version of that vision. The free and open web architected for equal access is instead dominated by a few large media companies who in turn are dominated by a few large technology platforms. Ad dollars flow up the chain to a few companies with headquarters between San Francisco and San Jose.And its entirely unclear in that context how most local communities  the cities and towns where we live work and play  will find the information they need to thrive.,USNEWS,cuqau4s,1,t5_2qlab

10844026,0,t3_5uzr8q,First off lets get the most important thing out in the open. In the event that Trump was impeached convicted by Senate and removed from office Vice Presidentelect Mike Pence would take the oath of office and become president in his place.No president has ever actually been removed from office as a result of impeachment although two  Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton  were found guilty of wrongdoing by the House of Representatives before being cleared by the Senate and in  President Richard Nixon resigned rather than facing an impeachment process for several charges related to the Watergate scandal. A major obstacle to impeaching Mr Trump is that both the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republicans. Lots of people have speculated that Mr Trumps own party are unlikely to impeach him unless of course they are put under a huge amount of public pressure. If a president is impeached this does not necessarily mean they will be removed from office.Impeachment is political rather than criminal and only the Senate can legislate to remove a president from office if this is the result of the impeachment trial.The Senate could also legislate to bar the person from ever holding public office in the future.If there are criminal charges these must be dealt with separate to the impeachment trial in the Senate.,USNEWS,ddyhh09,4,t5_2qlab
