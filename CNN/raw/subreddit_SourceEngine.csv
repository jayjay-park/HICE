2749857,0,t3_2riv24,Im leaving out a lot of detail but the major pieces are the gui the entities and the inventory.Youll have to create a VGUI panel that displays the pages. This tutorial might help. If you havent worked with vgui before brace yourself. Its a jungle. There are several different ways you could implement the vgui parts. Then you need a new entity something like itemjournal that players can use on to pick up the page. The page entity will have to specify which specific journal page you get from it which you would set in hammer when you place the entity. You have to create the entity class and add an entry to the .fgd file so that it shows up in hammer. To get started with creating the entity just look at one of the health pack items or something similar and go from there.And to keep track of which pages the player has you could just add some members to the player class. Youll have to use network vars because the server will modify the players inventory and the gui client will need to use it to display the gui.This tutorial is outdated and probably wont work asis but it might still help.,SourceEngine,cngnb3z,2,t5_2sogh
