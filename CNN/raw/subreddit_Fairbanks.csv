389434,0,t3_1yis91, Ive lived in SW Alaska and Anchorage but theres just something about Fairbanks. My wife thinks theres something in the water. Theres a big rivalry between Fairbanks and Anchorage apparently but I like visiting down there from time to time too.Winters can be tough. This year has been more odd than normal though. Weve had a lot of warm weather and almost not major cold snaps  days at  below or lower. Summers are where its at though. After suffering for  months seeing nothing but white and black summer is gorgeous and everyone is like a busy beaver getting stuff done fun work before it gets cold again. Ive never been bothered by the ton of light in the summer but it took about  years for my body to become sensitive to lack of light in the winter. I use a happy light at work and home.Fairbanks is expensive the air is horrible and people as a whole are completely nuts. Nuts but fiercely independent and some of the most giving people Ive ever seen.The first time you see the aurora is awesome. If you can try and find a book called Land of the Radioactive Midnight Sun. Its pretty funny and does a decent job in describing what Fairbanks is like as a newcomer.Amazon LinkUAF is alright. Just make sure you park your car correctly because they have squad of money hungry parking sharks. Welcome!,Fairbanks,cfl4pqh,3,t5_2s854

Contact lifewater the do home filtration stuff and that guy really knows what he is talking about. Instead of asking on here and getting reply from whomever. Talk to a professional,Fairbanks,cfwrepg,2,t5_2s854

1173315,0,t3_27igxs,I used to work at the university and the young military guys have a pretty negative stigma attached to them. Theyre usually known to be douchey aggressive and take advantage of the freshman girls.,Fairbanks,ci1m9jz,2,t5_2s854

1806344,0,t1_ck66xne,Im not sure what road you drove between Fairbanks and Anchorage but it is not the death drive you are making it out to be. Think of this It is the road that supplies the OIL FIELDS of the north slope. The state maintains it in the winter pretty well and they are constantly fixing it in the summer. It is not the sketchy road you are making it out to be. It has to be safe to allow the s of semis to travel safely  days per year that take supplies to the north slope.There are several places to get gas and they are rarely over  miles from each other. The biggest stretch would be between Trapper Creek and Cantwell. There is a hotel in Healy called the Totem that is open year round. We have weather reports and road service reports that can be gotten online. It is a good idea to check them before OP leaves. If they say white out conditions in the mountains then wait a day. I dont mean to be rude but you are giving advice like you grew up in a box or in Florida. OP is from Seattle. They have snow there and more ice than we do. Im guessing OP also has a brain and some common sense. ,Fairbanks,ck6u1qd,6,t5_2s854

2213571,0,t3_2kfu2u,Electric heaters suck and theyre dangerous. If you want to figure out how much its costing you each day take two readings of your electric meter  hours apart subtract the first reading from the second reading and multiply the result by . which is GVEAs current kWh rate. Electric heaters generally use    watts which would translate to .  . per day if its running constantly. This weeks forecast has temps below zero so your heater is going to have a tough time keeping up. ,Fairbanks,cll757b,5,t5_2s854
2295339,0,t3_2l6yit,The only people who complain about scantilyclad sluts are fatties and feminists. They are jealous of the attention they are not getting.Which one is Amanda Scott?,Fairbanks,clvf4o6,1,t5_2s854
2399471,0,t1_cm87w2n,Thank you for your advices I am reading a lot about driving there and I have also seen some of the videos on Youtube. We will be driving the bare minimum and use the shuttles where available for example uboxofstars mentioned a shuttle to Chena Host Springs.We already have written down Silvergulch Brewery on our to dos in Fairbanks list ! will take a look at those others places you mentioned thanks !,Fairbanks,cm8a6nc,1,t5_2s854

5294228,0,t1_cvdu6c6,Well thats a terrible first impression. Most of us are not that crabby! Sorry that was your first reply haha. I looked at your site your work is neat! If I had any extra money I would definitely want to work with you. If youre lucky there will be a clear night and some aurora activity while youre here.,Fairbanks,cvoedrk,1,t5_2s854

I talked to them about a week ago and they do have a mbit unlimited plan available for  a month. They have transmitters on Ester Dome College Road and Birch Hill. ,Fairbanks,cxl07yl,3,t5_2s854
6221133,0,t3_40nsy6,March is the best time to have a winter trip here! Theres a ton going on as the daylight is back and the weather is warming up.Someone else mentioned the dog mushing races which will be downtown easy to get to by bus or taxi. A personal favorite of mine. Is a big ice carving festival which is amazing.The lights depend on both space weather and local weather.Use this site for Aurora forecasting and hope for clear skies.  You do not need any special equipment to see them. Theyre just up in the sky. However if you want to get out of town away from the city light pollution you may need a car.Or take a trip out to Chena Hot Springs. Take a dip in the outdoor pool and check it out. They have a shuttle because they take tons of tourists from the airport out to the resort about an hour out of town.Welcome!,Fairbanks,cywrxi1,2,t5_2s854
6539069,0,t3_4572by,I go to The Alaska Club south. It suits me because they have childcare and a pool. But its the most expensive gym around. I pay mo for my family of four. My kids crave going there which is nice. Plus the expense makes me go more often so I dont feel like Im wasting it. ,Fairbanks,czvoyhh,3,t5_2s854
7550055,0,t1_d30cyfh,I got my truck off of Cragslist for k under what they wanted so it could be an option but it did take a month to find it... I am compleatly ignorent of the car prices in Washington. Maybe start researching the Cragslist for Seattle and Fairbanks to get a feel of the price difference in WA vs AK? Theres Affordible Used Cars which a few friends have gotten nice cars from them and there are a couple park and sells but I have never done something like that. ,Fairbanks,d30el7g,1,t5_2s854
8707129,0,t1_d6tu3nb,They got a bunch of used ones right now too ,Fairbanks,d6u0ydx,1,t5_2s854
8949263,0,t3_52unnx,AirBnb for lodging.  There are a few really nice  cabins in beautiful settings.  I dont think you were serious about the Innout burger or the logistics of how that would work but if you are Id love one lol. Never had the pleasure.  Chena hot springs is okay. Tolovana is cooler if youre up for an adventure.  If you rent a car drive up ester dome road at some point.  Very cool view.  If you like bicycling you can rent a fat bike from UAF and ride all around the woods.  Its fun with or without snow.  Definitely spend some time in the woods.  The smell at this time of the year is amazing with all the decaying plant matter.  Check out the transfer sites.  There are a bunch of em all over and seem to be pretty unique to fairbanks.UAF pub the marlin and the golden eagle are my favorite bars.  If you like to smoke herb you will find some there for sure.  If youre here for a week or so youre pretty much guaranteed to see the lights btw.  ,Fairbanks,d7nkhd9,2,t5_2s854

10376910,0,t1_dck9mp3,i see... wasnt planning on going to the springs just thought it be a good place to see the northern light.  We do plan on staying in the city.  Do you think its worth to do a day trip to see like the Dalton highway alaska pipeline and such?  ,Fairbanks,dckabei,2,t5_2s854
