4390419,0,t1_cskf136,Wow thanks for the info. It really never occurred to me that there can be variances in batches. Of course they will differ.... just like wine vintages. Not every year is the same. Must be the same with spirits such as mezcal especially when they are made in small batches. Ill have a look to see which batch I have,Mezcal,cskjbdh,1,t5_2utr7

I have always wanted to explore Mezcal but never got around to it because of lack of funds or availability.  Prior to these samples I have only tried Del Maguey Vida which I enjoyed.  Thanks to umikeczyz for these samples.  I am looking forward to jumping into these.      Both enjoyed neat in a Glencairn Glass rested for a few minutes.

The whole thing is carried along by a port like wine sweetness.   Finish  Menthol lingers along with floral notes.

Grass provides the backbone of this one.    Finish  Caramel sweetness lingers then bitter notes come forward followed by a lingering note of briny olives.Overall The San Andres was much easier sipping than the Ensamble but it was also less complex on the palate in my opinion.  However the San Andreas had a very complex finish that developed for much longer than the Ensamble.   The Ensamble was more demanding of my attention.  I kept discovering new nuances.  The San Andres was just a bit too sweet to be a regular pour.   Both were very complex and strong in different areas.  Both represented a big step up in complexity from the Vida.  A great introduction into the world of mezcal.  Im looking forward to the others to come.   ,Mezcal,d9wrzgl,4,t5_2utr7
