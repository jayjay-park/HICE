10613391,0,t1_ddanxbj,Good to know! I assumed with  of us it added up to the exact amount of listed roles. I think its doubly important that we all come forward with our roles as soon as possible to figure out if we have each role or we doubled up somewhere. Also if our leader Frank dies does that mean we lose that role or does a raccoon attacker take his place? ,HWWRaccoons,ddaov6r,5,t5_3ibx6

10733420,0,t1_ddn2hkm,I believe the role says visited by a raccoon which could be interpreted as a literal raccoon or a racoon faction member. I was actually going to ask this yesterday had I not gotten distracted and forgot all about it.,HWWRaccoons,ddn2lmd,3,t5_3ibx6
