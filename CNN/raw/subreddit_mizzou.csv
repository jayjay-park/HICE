The same types of people have made similar shifts throughout history. For example outright racists finally accepting the rights of black folks to go to school etc. but only separately. If you look at history critically you can actually track the evolution of the bigot rather easily.So I see what you did there bigots. But it didnt fool anybody.,mizzou,chh48h8,2,t5_2s1hj

3686438,0,t3_32kme6,I lived there freshman year . Discovery is fine. Its near Baja Plaza  and Rollins. The last two are basically on your walk to any of your classes. Vida coffee is also nearby. Youre PoliSci but I imagine most of your classes will be GenEds mostly in StricklandAampSMiddlebush which is fine. Its about a  minute walk to any of those places. I enjoyed Discovery for the most part. My roommate and I got along for the most part and our suitemates were fine too. However it wasnt a very social dorm when I was there so those three were the bulk of my social contact which you wont have a problem with since your rushing. Now heres my tips for how we really made the most of the dorm If youre on the east side of the building buy a special sun curtain. The blinds in the dorm couldnt stop a halfdead flashlight. The rooms are actually pretty spacious especially if you make the most of it. We did this by putting the beds into an Lshape in the corner with one resting on the floor which also allowed it to double as a couch for him and his GF. This gave us enough room to keep a card table unfolded in the corner as an extra surfacestorage area which was actually really helpful.  The best thing we did my roommate brought a projector. With the way we set up the room we could project a movie onto the wall we hung a white sheet for good measure and host  people for a movie nightNetflixetc. It got a bit warm but it was still fun. In general the temp control iswas wonky. I think it was because we were at the far end of the building and thus at the end of the duct but I have no idea. It was just hard to keep it at a comfortable temperature so if youre picky about that bring a fan just in case.,mizzou,cqch8lj,2,t5_2s1hj

4195670,0,t1_cryhhlv,I think the paying for friends is a bit played out.  You pay for Fraternity dues which can go towards the house social functions etc.  If you live in a dorm you still pay dorm fees and try to pool funds to have parties.  I lived with many guys in my fraternity and wouldnt consider half of them friends since graduating.  Its all about what you make it.I enjoyed being in a fraternity because of the organized social aspects.  Things like socials with sororities happened about once every  weeks on average.  Special weekends like Mom and Dads weekend were always something organized and fun.Hazing did happen and looking back on it it was fun.  Nobody was malicious or did it because they hated you.

If you listen to the media or other people who hate the idea of The Antlers go to an NFL game and sit close to the field so you can hear the shit the fans there say. The Antlers are a lot more composed than you think. Listen to their pregame jeers they make sense and are really funny. ushinymuskrat says that the curly headed one is a stuckup douche. I beg to differ. He is freakin nice. uluciddreamer puts it into perspective that they drink before a game. Actually no they dont. They even camp out to support the team.

It was always negative or neutral.Some things that come to mindWho the fuck is playing the bugletrumpet at  am every morning? At first I thought it was the ROTC students but that building was way too far away for how close it sounded.Why Why WHY do you guys have to have loud parties ALL NIGHT on a goddamn Tuesday? Seriously. I cant tell you how many times Ive heard drunken yelling at  am on a motherfucking Tuesday during the school year.WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SHOOT OFF FIREWORKS ON THOSE TUESDAY MORNINGS? WHAT IS THERE TO CELEBRATE? DUDE! I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK! NO.Why was it so funny to stick a dollar in a pile of human poop and watch as people went to pick it up? Thankfully I wasnt dumb enough to pick it up but seeing  faces snickering out a small window gave you guys away anyway And who was the lucky bastard that had to handle poop?I dont think I ever had an issue with sorority girls other than the shrieking can we stop shrieking please? and the fact that the entire street smells like a bad perfume shop on Friday nights.For me I kind of look down on the whole thing to be honest. I just dont see the appeal. I dont understand why some people think its funny or cool to behave like animals. Dont you want to be viewed as mature adults? Did you get sick of people treating you like you were children in high school?And its not just that one guy. Its always a big group of guys causing the most problems. I loved Mizzou and Columbia but dealing with Greek students was the worst part by far.
