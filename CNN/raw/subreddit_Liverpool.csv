9842006,0,t1_daqe76a,Yep good point.It doesnt help that the official opposition has only just sorted itself out. Realistically its gonna be a year before they truly start holding the government to account.Problem is the debate is framed as either high taxes and big government or low taxes and small government.Why not progressive taxes and extremely efficient government? Tax those who can afford it and use the tax system to encourage growth. Use every single penny of taxes in the most diligent way possible. It just annoys me when I see people saying the government should spend x millions on this.Thats your hard earned money theyre spending. Thats the money you earned getting up at am every day for. Thats the money you could have spent on your kids. Is the government getting the absolute maximum value for money? Theres room for another politics in the uk right now but its being drowned out by billionaire press barons and misinformation.I like the way the Liverpool council are tackling this problem  the way they spend needs to be as transparent as possible.
