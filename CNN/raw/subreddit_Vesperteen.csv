10401998,0,t3_5ou9wd,Hi. Welcome to the Vesperteam. Youre correct that Josh Dun and Colin Rigsby Vesperteen have a shared musical history. Rigsby iswas the drummer for House of Heroes and at one point Rigsby stepped away from touring with them to spend time with family. During that time Dun toured with the band in his stead. If you like Vesperteen andor TP I definitely recommend giving House of Heroes a listen too.,Vesperteen,dcn4t44,1,t5_3b1lv
