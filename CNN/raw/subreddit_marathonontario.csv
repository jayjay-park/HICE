11395885,0,t1_dfnokiq,I think Marathon had a really nice deep harbor itd be great if anything could be shipped from there on the great lakes but I guess peopled rather just use the existing facilities at Thunder Bay andor the Sault.   Good though glad to hear there is a future up that way.   I miss the North Shore a lot something I took for granted growing up there.   Is that old VOR still up on the hill there?  I used to love coming down hwy  and seeing that crazy disc up on the hill ,marathonontario,dfnpi92,2,t5_3jrq5
