5639991,0,t3_3sau34,Wow! Delurking just to say that you really nailed this entire look. Youve got lovely skin to begin with and I think its perfect that your makeup is clean and composed and lets your complexion shine through. The color on your lids is terrific and that is the ideal red lipstick on you! My only minor comment would be that your finished brows have a strong editorial look to them if thats your look rock it. If youre going for something more natural you could always lighten them up a bit. Either way I think they look great.,FourEyed_MUA,cww713n,2,t5_37fso
