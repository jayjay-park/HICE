887641,0,t1_ch3x6i8,Hah!  Funny those Talbots had to retire making the same noise those cars always made...  For some reason their valves were always out of adjustment the normal street Talbots I mean.It looks to me like those cars rolled a whole lot more.  Suspension must have come on a lot in controlling that.  They look very loose compared to more recent cars.,RallyPorn,ch56f5r,1,t5_2vfa3
