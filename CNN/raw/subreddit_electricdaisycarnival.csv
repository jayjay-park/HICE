All the bandwagoners and I hate to use this term but its totally appropriate here praised RAM as the best album ever produced Im exaggerating but still... just because Daft Punk made it and because they wanna look cool. If you were a real Daft Punk fan you would be able to critique it honestly and my personal opinion is that it sucked. I liked Get Lucky at first until the radio butchered the fuck out of it. Their last good album was Alive  Daft Punk as we knew them before are basically long and gone and like you said have devolved into overhyped pop stars. ,electricdaisycarnival,cewptfp,1,t5_2srd1

231812,0,t1_cf4ri5u,Yeah my group functions pretty well when everyone is separated lol. We went with about  people and at least half the group just wanders off randomly and after almost  years of going to raves Im discovering the joy of wandering off and doing your own thing too haha. I had a friend who just randomly took off and deciding to take a nap on the grass and met up with us a few hours later. Had a couple of others disappear until the end of the night or until a few hours after the night ended. Surprisingly with the amount of people there and all the service issues if we really wanted to meet up with someone we managed to do it pretty easily.I think in your situation it was easier to do things yourself because you just had one person with you and if you wanted to get separated and meet up you couldve probably orchestrated that pretty easily.

632952,0,t1_cgc3so6,When your tickets are selling out months in advance every year they are clearly underpriced. Either they keep the prices lower on purpose so they arent gouging people or they dont know how to price their tickets correctly to maximize profit. Given how long Insonniac has been around and Pasquales comments on the subject Im inclined to believe its the former. Also I believe that company also owns IDampT who operates Tomorrowland and the TL tickets are the most ridiculously under priced thing Ive ever seen in my life.,electricdaisycarnival,cgc7u0v,2,t5_2srd1

Lip balm ear plugs eye drops etc. Theyll also sell lollipops candy gum band aids tampons if youre female etc. Visine was  blow pops were  a pack of skittles was .  Theyll have a booth of light up toys and accessories costume stuff glow sticks etc.  Theyll have a booth on EDC merch. Shirts are usually about  IIRC hoodies are like . If you want something go ASAP on the first day. Theyll sell out of the popular styles and sizes in no time. Theyll also have hats and things like that. Insomniac water bottles will be . Nice for a souvenir.  Drinksfruit  water refills are free. Beers in cans are . Water or gatorade in bottles is . Mixed drinks are  and apparently not worth it because theyre weak. Fruit will range from  for a piece of fruit like an apple to  for a huge container of cut up fruit. Smoothies I think were  IIRC but they were huge. Lots of options for food youve just gotta look for it because sometimes its around the edges. All the carnival food will be there cotton candy candy apples pop corn funnel cakes hot dogs hamburgers pizza etc. There will also be things like tacos sushi burritos and allegedly gourmet food trucks but Ive never spotted the food trucks myself  Im told theyre along the back wall. Expect to pay like  for a piece of pizza to  for a decent meal. Something like a burger is like  or  bucks. Also lots of stuff in the diamond shaped building at the middle. Go up on the roof too. Lots of other little booths from whatever vendors apply that year. In  you could buy pipes inside for example. It really depends on who applies and who they let in year to year. Those booths are fairly standard though. ,electricdaisycarnival,cgfna4h,12,t5_2srd1

1296454,0,t3_28xc2d,This was my first EDC and as mentioned in other posts I saw a lot of good and bad. On the positive side I met people who were happy to just dance and enjoy the festival we made friends with people on the shuttle and pregamed with them and talked about our experiences the previous nights and one very nice lady offered my friend who was sick most likely dehydrated an unopened cold bottle of water just because she saw someone in need  these are the type of people that will make me go back to the event.On the downside especially as someone who doesnt partake in drugs other than alcohol  when my friend wasnt feeling well we were sitting next to a group of what seemed like older but coollax people near Calvin Harris. One of them was drinking something which I found out later that night was OJ laced with ketamine and LSD. My friend was in terrible shape after that and had lots of ups and lots of downs with random numbing in his body. Like really who goes to events to drug people who know no better? Then there were the people who just went to roll balls and werent friendlysocial at all  not a fun crowd to be around since it seemed like they could care less about the music.It was definitely an incredible experience and toward the end of the night yesterday my buddy and I were determined to spend our last  minutes there making people happy and getting them into the music so wed run around giving high fives complimenting people on outfits and getting people to dance with us and form small dance circles. While I wish there wasnt the bad crowd its bound to happen with that many people attending the event.All in all most likely will be back next year  see you all there ,electricdaisycarnival,cifguul,5,t5_2srd1

3021584,0,t1_coaq7jr,I am mostly referring to tickets on CL though right now is still definitely the worst time to buy on stubhub. CL obviously doesnt provide the same guarantees that stubhub does but you pay a pretty large premium by avoiding CL. Ive bought hundreds of tickets seriously hundreds off of CL over the last four years including my EDC ticket the past two years and my Coachella ticket a few years ago and never had an issue.I think CL is safe as long as you use your head register everything at purchase meet in a public place never accept anything less than hard tickets and never ever ever buy something that can be printed twice trust your gut and follow the absolute rule that if it seems too good to be true it definitely is.

Its a couple hundred bucks here and there which is much easier to manage. I book as early as possible i had my hotel for  booked in  june . I sign up for the newsletter and rebook if there are better prices.  I check flights out of all the areaairports within about a  hour drive.  I stay in  a very basic room  but on the strip so i dont spend a lot of money on transportation.  I make a lot of sacrifices to pay for festivals throughout the year as well.  I dint attend many expensive events  mostly cheap local shows.  I dont often eat at restaurants  or buy alcohol  and i mainly walk everywhere.  Very consious of not buying things because its only  bucks  because That money goes right to festivals.I also take other opportunities for earning some money like selling tickets out picking up odd jobs.If you treat it as an all year savings and look at it in small pieces it becomes much more manageable. ,electricdaisycarnival,coj8828,3,t5_2srd1

3728340,0,t3_331rww,Hey girl  I hit ezoo last year solo. I met up with some friends I had met online at the festival but I attended the festival itself on my own. As someone that has attended a festival independently but has also experienced EDCLV first time last year Ill share what I feel could guide you most.First and foremost stay alert. Use your street smarts all of them. When youre hitting a festival by yourself especially one of the sheer size of edclv you have to be on guard. This doesnt necessarily mean you cant enjoy yourself or relax though. Its more so being conscious of your surroundings and of the people around you. Its totally cool to engage and be social! you just have to use your intuition a bit. Stay confident but be aware of red flags. Observe others body language... and make eye contact with anyone thats being fucking weird. And say something if someone is making you feel uncomfortable in any way. Check for dilated pupils if theyre huge just back off. Stay away from anyone that appears belligerently intoxicated tripping balls etc. You dont know how theyre going to react as their judgment is impaired. The best places to avoid these people the smaller stages. Neon garden is ideal. Its likely where Ill be spending most of my time not only because I dig techno the most but also because the crowd is the most conscious and mature. That being said stay away from Kinetic Field or Circuit Grounds unless at that point youre with a group. Kinetic Field is the worst. Mad drunk people hella guys that just dont know how to behave even sober. And girls... but being a young adult female you will attract more men. If youre going to use any substance dont neglect your logic dont over indulge. Stay with it. Getting the most out of EDCLV isnt that difficult... Its gigantic with eight stages including the Discovery Stage with a variety of genres carnival rides art installations people watching Its limitless. Should there be any DJs that are a must see for you definitely check the set times in advance note the time and stage location of each set. Sometimes they overlap which is a bummer but its a festival. Catching every set is exhausting and impossible. Next to set times just wander. Gawk at the daisy hop all over the lily pads ride the swings just do it. Go with whatever looks like a good time. This is YOUR edc your weekend! Live it up however you want. Catch at least one sunrise... there isnt much that compares to a Las Vegas sunrise over the mountains. Its breathtakingly beautiful. and at edc? Fantasy. Do it.The best places to meet people would honestly be anywhere but Kinetic Field... its very easy to meet people in Cosmic Meadow as its the only comfortable place to sit and relax since its grassy. You could literally just sit down near a friendly looking group of people and start a conversation ask them what their plans are for the nightweekend and see if you mesh. Although Im going with a group this year something I might do for the hell of it is to just sit down at a random wedding see a couple get married. Im sure theyll be thrilled that someone they didnt know willingly sat down for it! The ceremonies are cute too a couple friends of mine had an EDC wedding last year and it was adorable to watch... but meeting people is so easy. You could be standing in line for the bathroom or for water and just talk to the person next to you. First be mindful use your judgment before engaging with anyone but be open and friendly. Youll attract what you expend. Be confident smart and friendly and the same will come to you. No expectations merely anticipation.Attending a festival solo was pretty ideal I was on no ones schedule but my own hit every set I wanted met some pretty cool people. I had my transportation planned out I knew what subways to take and had a shuttle pass. If you dont have a shuttle pass for EDC buy one unless you plan on driving. The shuttles are safe and take you back to the strip. If youre driving yourself however stay alert when returning to your car. The parking lot is massive and you never know what assholes could be lurking around. Its unlikely but still possible.I will say its best to have people to meet up with. There might be a reddit meet up! Go to it. On the first night get the numbers of anyone you meet that you like to meet up with the following night. Familiar faces are comforting  and everyone is so friendly at edc that finding the right people should be no object. Dress up comfortably though avoid fluffies and any material that traps heat. Fanny pack it for sure. be cute have fun  Its nearly impossible to have a shitty time at EDC. Its seriously the happiest place on earth. I hope its a good time  find me at the garden Ill groove with you fasho D,electricdaisycarnival,cqh97lz,3,t5_2srd1

Maybe explain you forgot you left it in there or you are trying to give it to a person with a press pass who forgot theres and had you bring it. Without a lens or a body its no threat.

I doubt it.

7684241,0,t3_4kectc,Im a bit of a lineup junkie its been a hobby of mine since I first started going to raves in . One of my favorite past times is to go through the lineups from all the big festivals around the world. I even make up some fake dream lineups in free time. With that said I have to strongly disagree that this isnt a great lineup. Its probably the best since  if your a trance fan one of the best for techno since  and one of the best for house music Ive ever seen. I might argue that with the dreamstate lineup you have one of the best trance lineups to ever be on one stage Above amp Beyond Gaia Aly amp Fila Ferry Corsten presents Gouryea Markus Schultz. Its just an amazing lineup and if they organize the set times correctly this could make for a magical night because these guys can play great off each other. The Drumcode takeover of the Neon Gardens is really stacked with top techno Adam Beyer Nicole Moudabar Alan Fitzpatrick Bart Skills Pan Pot. Plus on the other days you have Ritchie Hawtin Loco Dice and Umek. The house Im talking real house like deep and tech house is also quite fat Hot Since  Maya Jane Coles Dusky Lane  Mark Farina DJ Dan Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs Julia Gover Jonas Rathsman Derrick May Hannah Wants Shiba San Duke Dumont.Cant really comment on the dubstep edm or trap artist because Im not a fan of those genres. But I have to say this lineup is stacked. Pretty sad Im not going this year ,electricdaisycarnival,d3fnfzb,3,t5_2srd1

8081964,0,t1_d4nl90u,I caught sets on all the stages except for Stage  didnt get a chance to stop by this year. I do agree that the vibes are different depending on each genre. I noticed that everyone at basscon was dancing in some type of way. Neon Garden was home to a lot of shufflers. All the head bangers camped at the basspod. but at all the stages it seemed like everyone was to themselves or amongst their group. I admit i was too busy in my own world and kept to myself majority of the weekend enjoying the music but at other events that ive been to i feel like the crowd embraced unity and positive energy. Maybe i was at the wrong spot all weekend. I think i shouldve described the crowd this year as shy rather than saying bad vibes. Cause now that i think about it i didnt run into rude people at all. Just shy i guess,electricdaisycarnival,d4ohk24,2,t5_2srd1

8102679,0,t1_d4qjhby,This years EDC didnt resonate the way it did for me in . I couldnt figure out why but I think its the amount of people that attend now.If you think about it most of us avoid malls during the holidays because everyone is there shopping. Theres lines and its crowded and you get less help from sales associates because of the demand for them. However I personally enjoy spending hours at the mall early on a Monday when I have my time and space to browse.EDC didnt feel as intimate. Back in  I made it to the front and back of Circuit Grounds in  minutes with so much ease. Conversations were easier because theres so much space and we werent being shoved around. The only time I felt like that was at Cosmic Meadows which was where I stayed most of the time.,electricdaisycarnival,d4qtbm5,3,t5_2srd1

8286207,0,t3_4sbmnd,I didnt take the insomniac shuttles instead I took juscollege bc in  there were barely any waits. We were told a week before EDC that insomniac was taking over the same route juscollege took in  meaning we would be taking the freeway. Every night I took the first shuttle at pm the first day there was barely any traffic and we got to the speedway within minutes. No issues getting back then again I didnt stay for any sunrises this year  left around   am every night to avoid traffic and no one I really wanted to see were playing those times that weekend so I figured Id beat everyone to the punch and take an early shuttle Second day was a little better but our shuttle driver took the same route insomniac claimed  no complaining here got there within  minutes again. The third day was probably the worst but then again not as bad as what evberyyone who left LATE went through. I got on the very first shuttle at pm on the third day and the driver stated he would be playing HIS music unless you wanted to request a song for  per song. He also stated that he likes relaxing drives and does not want to run into traffic and that he would be taking the LONG way with an estimated ride time of  hour and  minutes. I was sitting in the second row of the shuttle and everyone was passing money down the driver was making us listen to classic rock no fucking thanks.. I pitched in  to ensure we all had enough to at least have our music playing during the ride to the speedway. It took us about a solid hour to get there not bad. But kinda ridiculous for the shuttle driver to try and score money off of us for song changes. That was about as bad as it got for me but I did have friends who left at later times the second night and it took them about  hours to get to the speedway. One of my friends stated that his shuttle driver was telling ppl on the bus to fuck off and to worry about their own jobs when he insisted on staying in the SLOW lane and refused to move to a lane where traffic as actually moving. So if theres one advice I can give regarding shuttles I would suggest leaving EARLY yeah youre tired from the night before but you can rest at the venue under a shaded area. Plus the sunsets at EDC are so beautiful. ,electricdaisycarnival,d5dc21i,1,t5_2srd1

If he does bring it back you definitely dont want to miss out on it even if its just for a little bit. Very unique environment amp its what got me into that dark techno sound.

9661368,0,t3_5db2rv,Just to start this might be a long one. My name is Albert I went to my first EDC  years ago when it was only a couple hundred people. I am now  I have been all over to all insomniac hard and many warehouse raves that started with a couple generators and a pair of bolt cutters haha. The thing about the electric daisy carnival once it moved to Vegas is that it because not so easily accessible to people that just didnt have anything to do that weekend. EDC had become a pilgrimage for people that are willing to All year and drain all there saving just to be a part of it the music it great but the thing that has always brought us back is the culture. Dont get me wrong there are a lot of people that are only our for themselves but once you go past that there is nothing but love and acceptance. The kindness I have received is unmatched to anything I ever get in the real world. As long As you have a good group that is always thinking about each other before themselves you are going to be ok. You give love you receive love for the most part. You always find pockets of great people in the crowd that are really about the scene not just because the heard chainsmokers on the radio or just want to go to get fucked up our of there mind to where they forget why we are there. We want to escape reality not be judged on what car we drive or if you have nice shoes. None of it matters its about being together in a safe space where everyone has unconditional love for each other and you can always get a hug to melt away any problems your having in your day to day life. This is where I run away every year this is what I work so hard all year long to do. The Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas isnt just a rave or a concert. Its a place to reboot Its a place to get therapy. Everyone is always welcomed to join us as long as you have PLUR in your heart just send me a message on Instagram itsmeyogibear.

11216986,0,t3_6044ke,Odd qualifiers to this story that I dont want to detract from the main messagemy wife and i are both active LDSMormons and as such dont participate in drugsReal qualifiers Before going to EDC my wife had been to one concert Coldplay...   BUT she agreed to go with me. Also she hates halloween and dressing up. I got her to do very poor quality Ash and Misty costumes and morph suit costumes.She doesnt really like EDM much but had heard some Calvin Harris songs.My recommendations  . If there is a conflict of who would like to see and someone she is remotely interested. GO WHERE SHE WANTS TO GO! P  . There is a large grass field near the entrance where you can sit  down relax and still have an excellent view of the cosmic meadow stage.. It really is all about the production. I missed last year but went  years in a row and I can saw seeing the stage performers seeing the fireworks the elaborate art constructions and just hanging around were amazing.Now my top two favorite experiences.   One with without the wife my buddy and I found a girl slightly whimpering curled up new a metal construction box. We asked if we could sit down and started chatting. She had lost her group of friends and her cell phone was either dead or had no service we offered her use of ours and she was able to contact her group and meet up with them.Number  when I went with my wife  years ago we sat outside Carl Coxs set and saw a utility belt that had keyswalletcellphonecash the whole gamut. We immediate snatched it up tried the cellphone text messages to get a hold of someone. Nothing.  minutes later a couple in their s started combing the area for something. We politely asked Are you looking for something? The woman replied almost in tears she lost her things. We said Are these they? side joke WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?And in fact they were. She and her husband were overjoyed and thanked us a million times.So my last recommendation is this Create a memory of PLUR. Of Peace Love Unity and Respect. Try to help someone in need or someone who is feeling out of place. It will draw your wife closer to the experience and make the festival about what it should be about Which is oddly what sounds like attracts your wife the productionculturefeeling.I hope you and your wife have a great experience!! EDC is like disneyland for adults. Take time to ride the carousel and just be there. If you highlight the fireworks displays and the artworks itll be amazing.ps.  The last year I went Kaskade did a semiunannounced set on the Mayan Art car to a group of a couple hundred people. My wife wasnt really enjoying the music. But I leaned over and said Honey someday youre going to be able you saw a secret show of Kaskade with a couple hundred people. Thatll make up for the music that isnt your style.  True enough not long ago I heard her talking with a friend who loves Kaskade and she got to drop that gem. Sometimes getting them out of their comfort zone can be a good thing if you can think of a reason why. CHEERS!,electricdaisycarnival,df3fjyk,3,t5_2srd1

The cherry on top was that she said Yes right as the song dropped. Something I wish to relive all the time. Its on video if you guys want to see it let me know  its on my Twitter pinned. ,electricdaisycarnival,dgr4542,29,t5_2srd1

11752495,0,t3_67lsa5,I used to wear roshe runs but the soles on them wear out very quickly especially when you wear them as festival shoes.I have been extremely satisfied with Nike Air Huarache lows trainers. They are much more comfortable and holds up better vs roshe runs through the usual festival terrain. I would say this would be little below vs the ultraboost in terms of comfort but way cheaper than the ultraboosts. Only reason Im not wearing ultraboost to festivals is that I cant convince myself to trash  on a pair of shoes.,electricdaisycarnival,dgs6ax6,2,t5_2srd1
