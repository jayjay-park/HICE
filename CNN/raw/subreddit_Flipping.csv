The mechanic will charge you  regardless of how much time it takes. If the book says  hours youre getting charged for  hours even if it only took !Thats why I love working on these cars. I can get a low mileage car for  spend  for the gasket set and have it back on the market in the same day for .As you found out these were notorious for the lower intake manifold LIM gaskets going bad. Its because GM used pressed paper gaskets along with gasket eating Dexcool. Dexcool was rated for K miles before servicing but most of the gaskets never made it past K miles. GMs response at the time was to throw in a new gasket and not redesign the gasket itself so the gasket would fail again.The news gaskets are made from silicone and metal and if installed correctly will out last the motor.I bought another Century for my inlaw that had a bad gasket too. I tore the whole top end off and replaced all the hoses spark plugs plug wires cleaned out the throttle body cleaned the mass air flow sensor new air filter new green  coolant and while I had everything off I took each valve head off and replaced the head gaskets while I was in there. It was just an additional  bolts I figured why not? Had the heads cleaned out while I was working on everything else.Total bill was  and she runs amazing! Its literally a brand new car again. Throttle response is quick idles smooth and I saved thousands if I wouldve had a mechanic do all that.,Flipping,ceha7hq,1,t5_2y9q6

62428,0,t1_celiznf,I have posted a fair amount on this account about my online business. Im the managing director and majority owner of a business that sells across multiple accounts and multiple eBay sites in a variety of categories. We sell into some of the most difficult categories on eBay including preowned brand bags jewelry and watches. We also sell new and used electronics and other items as well. Due to the nature of our business I am hyperaware of eBay policies and very cautious not to cross them. Although I am probably one of the larger sellers that regularly posts to rebay I am just another seller to eBay and could be banned just as quickly as anyone else here.Its great to try to increase sales on eBay and grow your business. Fee avoidance is not a good way to do that and if eBay is a significant part of your business I dont think the risk to your income is worth the  percentage points you stand to gain.,Flipping,celjcq6,2,t5_2y9q6

151240,0,t1_cevhsqh,I have to disagree with some of what you said.  Be careful when generalizing mall brands.  Saks Fifth Ave would be considered a mall of sorts specifically a luxury department store.  If youre not familiar they sell many very high end brands.  Aeropostale American Eagle are good suggestions to AVOID since theyre primarily marketed to the customer segment that values cheap clothing.  What I think youre trying to say is avoid lowend brands marketed as a value buy specifically being cheap as theres very little wriggle room as it makes its way down the resale outlets.  Also to say that youd want to avoid anything marketed towards the  year old age range is careless and complete misinformation since a big chunk of that has serious purchasing power i.e.  and the others that dont who do you think does the buying?  The ones that do have the purchasing power  their parents or even to the extent that they give them plastic to use.  Abercrombie amp Fitch is a good brand for resale even though theyve had their fair share of negative press it actually went viral with their latest incident with their founder.  Take a look at what their clothing originally sells for.  I think its ridiculous but somehow theyve also done a good job otherwise selling a lifestylepersonality that customers like to associate with even though they may or may not agree with the companys views.  ,Flipping,cevnogc,1,t5_2y9q6

Here and there youll find something with high  margins and decent liquidity but daytoday its about grinding out sale after sale.Consider though you make  per DVD set. Takes a minute or two to create a listing another minute to print a label thermal printer and stick it on a bubble mailer with the DVD set. The listing is a fixed cost since you can reuse it. So it averages out to a couple minutes work for lets say  on average. Plus ebay bills fees monthly and doesnt automatically bill till the middle of the next month so you have  days to churn any ebay fees into new inventory.Its not unreasonable to make hr if you are efficient about your processes and thats what separates the big boys from the small timers who will most likely give up because its too much work.

448176,0,t3_1z7c0i,I would not trust any of the prices shown on a TV show.  The shows are more about trying to make flipping look exciting then they are about trying to be accurate.  I would also venture to say that it is a mistake to think of the price of an item as a single number.  It is in fact a wide range of possibilities.  Similar items will often sell for wildly different numbers based on where you sell it and how much effort you put into marketinglisting the item.  This is the reason people say to look at ebay completed listings.  Not only can you see what it sold for but also the frequency the deviation and how exactly those who were successful were able to market it.  The ebayscavengers podcast may in fact be awesomeI have never heard it but as a general rule I would not fully trust any information from youtube videos or podcasts.  Those people make those videos and podcasts to generate advertising revenue.  If they were that good at ebay they would spend their time selling crap and not explaining to people how to compete with them.  Edit  Doing research is an excellent idea in general and you should do as much as you possibly can about everything you buy.  However you generally need to experience the heartache of buying and selling for yourself to learn how to recognize the accurate information from the background noise of misinformation.  I do not think this sort savviness can really be explained to someone.  TLDR I have trust issues and you should too,Flipping,cfr7v9j,9,t5_2y9q6

597135,0,t3_20yy17,I wash everything since that is eBay policy but there are some vintage items that I will not clean if I believe a collector would prefer to use their own cleaners or technique. I always disclose if this is the case. If I find a new with tags item in a thrift I will wash the item to get rid of the smell then list as preowned and include the tags in photos and add in the description that its unworn but has been laundered. I know some may think Im wasting my time with washing and ironing but I like feeling confident my item is better than expected when shipping an item out. The few dry clean only items I pick up need to be something Im sure I can recoup the dry cleaning cost or something unstructured that Ill chance hand washing. I will disclose the care tag states dry clean but I did wash it. I believe many manufactures state dry clean only so they can reduce returns due to improper laundering. I have never had a complaint on these items.  I realize that most people are going to wash clothing they buy from a stranger on the Internet but I choose to follow the rules of the venue I sell on. Im not sensitive to smells but I dont want a bunch of thrift store funk smelling items in my home. ,Flipping,cg85c4g,1,t5_2y9q6

604680,0,t3_212gdc,I see them at my local thrift shops and Ive seen people give them away on Craigslist.  Places like Best Buy charge ridiculous prices for repairs so people think theyre too expensive to replace.  They often dont bother looking for independent shops but even they charge high prices because they can and all they have to do is beat Geek Squads prices by a little bit.  If you pick up enough systems of these systems eventually youll have a stock of parts and can make one working PC from several or a couple.  There isnt much margin in the hardware so stores dont make much there.  Thats part of the reason they charge so much for cables etc.  As far as too old to mess with Microsoft is rolling out a new OS every other year and in a couple weeks they will no longer support XP.  They will support their current OS and the one older than that.  That means every four years people will have to upgrade and that means bigger hard drive processor AND memory.  For practical purposes that means a whole new computer.  And to get windows cheaply it will have to be an OEM copy and theyve recently made it so that isnt easily done.However most of the computers you pick up will have a Windows license already and most of the manufacturers put a recovery partition on the hard drive.  This means if you get the computer from an individual you wont have to worry about Windows.  A business is probably going to wipe the drive though and not include Windows.  A google search will tell you how to get to that different for every manufacturer.  You can also find service manuals online for many of them and there are tons of YouTube videos for replacing parts.There are also plenty of diagnostic tools and boot disks out there for free.Good luck!  ,Flipping,cg907fu,2,t5_2y9q6

For me its about seeing the progress of those established full time pickers that get involved with arbitrage. One minute theyre sceptical then the next few weeks theyre having some issues sourcing products then the next month they be ballinA lot of the youtube pickers have become youtube arbitragers. Thats a pretty big endorsement. Beyond that wheres the difficulty?You go to a retail or online retail establishment  portal. You look at an item and think could this possibly be sold at a higher price on ebay  amazon. Decide to check the price bang you have your answer.From these threads and the youtube videos you know what product types are hot food health and beauty toys clearance and you know which stores to go to the big cheap ones. Not that Ive done much retail arbitrage but Im doing a little every month mostly online and so far each transaction has been managed by the principles above.

After seeing that there are cheaper alternatives these days Ive realized Ill have to lower that price the next go round.For video games I use a site which amalgamates amazon ebay etc. prices and asked that price though I know I probably should have went to  for the sell.The textbook also wasnt available for less than  when I listed it now I see there are cheaper options so Ill have to lower it.And as previously stated the waiting game kills me but youre definitely right.Thanks so much for the input!,Flipping,cha746g,1,t5_2y9q6

953686,0,t3_250l96,Well I would never want to discourage someone from taking a chance on an item to flip this has BAD IDEA written all over it and I would approach this flip with caution. However if you are insistent on proceeding with this flip you need to double check that Harvey Manhattan is the maker of the accordion. To me that sounds like name amp location of previous owner. I did a quick search for you and I dont find any accordion maker named Harvey. Second just because the outside of the accordion looks great does not mean the internals are in great shape. Third Shipping these is a pain. Fourth Are you an accordion player? If not to get anywhere close to maximum value for this piece you will have to take it to a music shop to have it looked at by someone who knows what they are doing. I used to sell  or  accordions a year through eBay. The last one I sold had an issue with the bellows the buyer was not satisfied and I was not about to spend  dollars to have him pay return shipping on a  dollar accordion. That was the last time I attempted to sell an accordion. Now if an accordion comes my way I just drop it off at the local auction house. Hope this helps and let us know what you decide or add some pictures of it when you go back but I am pretty positive Harvey is not the maker.,Flipping,chcoxgz,4,t5_2y9q6

Although I do see your point...As a seller your job is to manage customer expectations. Failure to properly do this will lead to unhappy customers and that leads directly to opened eBay cases poor feedback low DSRs for Item As Described and in some cases credit card chargebacks.With the new eBay defect system starting in August and already counting now any Item As Described rating of  stars or less counts as a defect. Every opened eBay case also counts as a defect regardless of the actual outcome. Neutral and Negative feedback also both count as defects.While I think the new system is too strict it is the world that all eBay sellers will have to live in. If you wish to continue selling on eBay you need to make sure your customers can clearly see any problems with your items before you list them. Failure to do this will result in an abrupt end to your flippingselling career.To fix your listing you need to list the problems with the MacBook at the top of the listing. The problems both cosmetic and with the battery need to be shown together with your line that says The Macbook powers up and loads perfectly. No internal logic board CDDVD or HDD problems. The screen is in good condition. You should also avoid saying that there are no problems with the logic board as you dont know if it is the battery connector part of the logic board that is fried or the battery itself.Finally you have to remember that if you mislead people with your listing which you are doing now some will fry your computer on purpose open an Item Not As Described case and force a return. Just be honest its the best and only workable long term policy.Edit Added quote and note about logic board vs battery.Edit  Holy shit you have  feedback and a . for Item as Described!?

1215309,0,t3_27zkzb,The worth of a bicycle is heavily locally dependent and reading your local Craigslist daily over the course of a year will give you the best sense. Every day there are bikes that sell for    that you could sell for    eventually even without any work on them but you would have to invest some time and storage space. Much more rarely there are bikes selling for  that you can sell on eBay for  but wouldnt even get  for locally. These are the good condition early mountain bikes from smaller makers the s and s road bikes that owners think have depreciated but were actually highquality steel with excellent components things of that realm. You wont make your bread and butter off those but if you can ID them by sight from ads that describe them poorly you will score every couple weeks. You really need to buy a bike for several hundred dollars less than what its worth to make it a good eBay sale due to shipping costs fees risk from bad buyers etc. I would be surprised if you can do this fulltime even especially? in a major metropolitan area. There are a lot of people who love bikes or flip bikes and its probably one of the most wellwatched sections on CL. Youd have to be willing to buy a lot of bikes that could sell for  more and hold them for a while until they sold. But as a sideline its worth picking off the better bargains for sure.The market changes a lot over time as well. Five years ago you would have been really stoked to find a good condition vintage GT Zaskar for  but now that might not even sell on my local CL. Same with early StumpJumpers. On the other hand you used to be able to get early Treks for  pretty often but now they are typically listed for  or more. This might just be in my area though its hard to know because shipping and packing costs mean that the bike market remains highly localized.Thankfully the raging market for taking decent road bikes and turning them into pathetically executed fixedgear conversions has almost completely died out by me but that used to be easy money for some folks. Look for internally geared bikes with Nexus or SachsSRAM hubs. Not everyone appreciates these but lots of people do so they have decent supply and strong demand. Another good area is accessories like quality panniers and saddles. Right now in my market there is a bike that has been for sale for a week with a Brooks saddle and wooden grips for . That same bike could sell for  eventually without the sweet parts and you could get  off the grips and saddle themselves. But youd have to be patient.You can trust me Ive bought and sold dozens of bikes on Craigslist and only lost a few thousand dollars.

The definition of self employment.  I was pulling in almost  tax free.  I did this for almost  years.  I made great money and had lots of nice things.  Like a car.One day I said to my father I want to quit hauling scrap and get a REAL job with a paycheck.  I did what almost every  year old does got a job at McDonalds.I used to work  hours a week max hauling scrap.  My first pay was for  hours in a week and a half for a grand total of about .  Reality hit me very hard then.I know that it seems that I am supporting his claims but here is the rest of the story.  I started placing ads to haul scrap again but barely got any calls.  One day I looked and saw that the market was completely saturated with other people doing the same thing.If I had stayed self employed I would have lost money steadily because of market saturation.  I had nothing to fall back on and no way to supplement that decreasing income.  Scrap hauling is not something that can branch out much.I had a steady paycheck then and to be honest I am glad that I finally got a part time job to supplement that income I am missing from flipping.Its not that I am bad at it but I am just getting started.  Flipping on a grand scale takes a lot of time.I understand that you are just getting your feelings out there but that . an hour I am making isnt wasting my life.  Its giving my kids the things they need a few things they want and possibly some bills paid and creditors off our backs.  Maybe even a weekend vacation.  In essence it buys my family a better life than when I am not working.  For that I will gladly give up my hours for that.Let me leave you with this...

Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor SafetyFranklin was not advocating less security and he was not attempting to make the argument that liberties should be chosen over security he was instead attacking the false dichotomy of having to choose between the two.  He wrote it  years before the revolution and the essential liberty he was referring to was the ability of a colonial assembly to levy higher taxes.  The governor at the time used the urgent need for security against Indian raids to attempt to extort the assembly out of its ability to raise taxes.

1762875,0,t1_ck1a1py,It is your responsibility to get the item to them in the same condition you described it. From your description it sounds like they had every right to file a claim.As far as claiming insurance you need to prove that the item was damaged. For that you would need at least a picture of the damage but since you have already issued the refund And from the sound of it irritated the customer you are going to have a hard time convincing them them to send you a picture.Next time you need to do a bunch of stuff differently. Package the item so well that if someone dropped it down a flight of stairs it would still survive getting hit by a car.. If your package still ends up getting damaged have them describe the damage and send you a picture. Is it so badly damaged that the item is useless? Then issue them a refund without a return. Is the item damaged cosmetically but still useful? Offer the customer a partial refund for the damage or have them send it back to you for a full refund. Dont mention reimbursing them for return shipping but if they ask then oblige them. Dont issue a refund without proof of damage.. DO NOT issue a refund without proof of damage.. Take your proof of damage to the USPS website and submit the damage for a refund. You paid extra for insurance and they will reimburse you for your losses. Which means you still get paid.. If all else fails cut your losses. In your case you would have lost the claim lost the item lost the money and most likely had bad feedback on your account. Which means you would not be able to sell anything else because no one will buy from someone with  bad feedback.Edit. Be friendly to the customer.

Just go to the thrift store and look for something for a buck or two and start the auction at cost. That way you give a great deal on an item and wont lose any money.

2439058,0,t3_2nd505,Hey Im new here but I have been hobby flipping to have abit extra for groceries and the like for  years and Ive made around some  GBP from it. Small money but Ive really not put any effort into it. Ive never done any statistics on it. This is something I need to learn. Finding this place have made me decide to try and establish a steady income from flipping.Ive used ebay alot so thats basicly covered. However my account has been my personal account and Im wondering if I should make a new one exclusively for selling. I havent really used it for a year. I have a teal star but I do have  negative and  neutral ratings from douchebag scammers and yea ebay wont do anything about it. So should I start from scratch? Is it even possible to make a new account? Right now I have roughly  GBP which I could put towards flipping. I really should spend it on other stuff but I want to get going! So what should I do with my money? Im thinking about buying X amount small item  packeging  stamps. Im not a car owner at the moment so I cant really go on a treasure hunt and Ive moved recently so I dont even have a route yet. So online bulk buying? Im scared to get scammed and lose the money because GBP can go a long way for me. Also Ive scoured my stuff for items to sell and I have a big box waiting to get listed with around  GBP goods in it if everything sells. ,Flipping,cmd68qw,1,t5_2y9q6

Theyll ship them directly to your home and you can then pack print the label and seal the box in the comfort of your home. If its available in your area the post office offers free pickup of priority mail from your house so you can leave the package outside for the mail carrier to pick up when they deliver your mail.  If you dont want to do that you can always drop the package off at the post office and get a receipt of acceptance or if your package is small enough you can just drop it in a mailbox.

What do you think would happen to all the people who  have landlords  telecommute if this stuff made sense...? Operating a business out of a residence is only an issue when it creates traffic andor involves doing odd things on the premises. Your landlord will not like you doing heavy manufacturing or having a stream of customers coming and going. He will not care if you type things and wrap parcels. Those rules apply to homeowners as well it comes down to the neighbourhood your home is in. I have a house but I cant turn it into a factory or a restaurant just because I own the land.You might want to try local adult evening classes  check community college casual adult stuff  for intro to small biztype classes.,Flipping,cor3j4h,2,t5_2y9q6

You probably know well that toddlers have a  min attention span.  So those dolls they are dying for today are probably going to end up at the bottom of the toy chest half broken tomorrow.  Part of raising a child is exposing them to new experiences and qualities that instill your values and priorities.  I could have taken my kid to toysrus this past weekend to buy an Elsa doll but instead I took her fishing with a cane pole I got for free.   years from now she will care less about Elsa but she is going to remember her first time fishing.

3607539,0,t3_31mb8z,nd week of hitting garage sales  gf found a cool app that maps them all out so we went to a couple that were near by.    The first was a total bust  then I noticed another yard sale across the street that seemed a bit better laid out.    I noticed several boxes of DVDs and immediately saw someone scanning.    I got a bit anxious thinking he had already cleaned everything out.   That was when I laid my eyes on several boxes of lg d glasses.    I asked if they were part of the sale and the owner replied yes.    Mid sentence another flipper walked right in front of me and grabbed a box.    Without hesitation I said Id take the rest.    I ended up with  pairs of passive lg d glasses for  cents a piece NIB  also picked up  Xbox gold  month subscriptions for each.    Does anyone have any experience selling the Xbox lives on eBay with digital delivery?    I thought it wasnt allowed by eBays rules but I noticed several sellers doing it anyways.

4236538,0,t3_39fmy4,eBays calculated shipping rates for FedEx are way off when listing an item. Even though eBays shipping calculator shows the FedEx economy rates to be the cheapest for large items you get charged additional fees that can bring the total shipping cost to an amount equal to or greater than the USPS and UPS rates. On some of my sales the final FedEx shipping fee was  higher than what the eBay calculator estimated but the buyer wasnt charged this higher rate. Apparently this is because FedEx generates the shipping cost after the item is delivered and some of their fees include a residential delivery surcharge and delivery area surcharge. Plus they calculate their rate using dimensional weight that treats a large package as if it weighed more than it actually does. I shipped a Rock Band drum set that weighed  lb but they weighed it at  lb.None of this is factored into eBays shipping calculator. The end result is that YOU pay the additional shipping charges which only show up on your monthly eBay invoice. So all this time Ive been paying way more for FedEx shipping than I thought because I assumed I was getting cheaper rates. Whats extra annoying is that Ive been making special trips out to the FedEx shipping offices when I could have been shipping everything USPS and dropping all my packages off at the post office. ,Flipping,cs35mm7,5,t5_2y9q6

4547721,0,t3_3dcax5,Just giving my perspective in a very mid range type city. There are lots and lots of thrift stores with many of them still ah info reasonable prices. There are hundreds of yard sales each weekend during the summer. There are several estate sales and auctions each weekend. There are hundress of stores for RA. The best part is that there doesnt seem to be a ton of competition for as many sources as there are here. Ive seen some but I can easily make a living off reselling here because of the numerous amounts of sources vs resellers. Im not sure if this is the same in other mid range cities I would guess pop. is around k or so but it also most the perfect mix here. ,Flipping,ct3v5lb,1,t5_2y9q6

4575761,0,t3_3dopyb,Novice typewriter flipper guy here  here are my thoughts. I dont know how to price these correctly. I got a few on ebay of different types selectric iii selectric ii  non correcting etc so Im not sure what the magic touch on these is. I do see them going for like .  Might have to decrease the price a bit to get them out the door. If you go the ebay route I think shipping fedex seems to be the better idea.. There are a few things that you can do to try to fix them up. The spacebar not registering sounds like maybe a sticky key. Check the rest of the keys and see how they are. There are a few videos online on how to get them work on them. Generally you use some rubbing alcohol in the lever parts that are in front of the keys and work them by repeating pressing them up and down. Once again youtube could be helpful.  You may want to see if it starts working correcting after warming up for a bit. Thats the issue Im having with one of them at the moment.  My issue might be worn gears issue but I have to do some digging. Anything beyond that I pretty much have my dad work on since he worked on typewriters for like  years.Im out for the next week but if you have some questions still Ill gladly answer any if I can when I get back.Edit You can always list it on ebay for parts  not working. Might get  bucks out of it. Shipping it without the shell would reduce the weight but that foam stuff that is on the side of the case can get pretty nasty and turn in to a tarlike substance  real pain in the ass to get cleaned up.,Flipping,ct7ds47,2,t5_2y9q6

But when I went last week they were having a sale where all books were ..I guess they were just trying to blow them out.

I provide measurements for each item because  This decreases the amount of questions I get.  I dont want to touch an item until it ships. And  It just looks better IMHO.gtHow do you pin point your price point?In my head I have pricing set for certain brands already. There will always be a set range for things like Gap Old Navy etc. However for things from more desirable brands OR brands Im not familiar with here is my process Search broadly for an item. ie J.Crew jeweled sweater. Select Sold listings Sort by highest first Unless I have something REALLY special I go with what I feel is average.Now heres why its important to search by highest first There are a lot of clothes out there AND a lot of brands. Theres no way to know everything. You might have an item thats highly sought after and routinely sells for big bucks. However if you just search by recently sold you may never know this. It doesnt happen TOO often to me but I dont want to lose money just because I priced something wrong.gtOn average how long do you have an article of clothing in inventory?Depends. Some items sell in  minutes. Others sell in a year. Sometimes you get it right sometimes you dont. Id go into it looking at clothing as a LONG sell. Youre basically waiting for the right buyer whos the right size who wants YOUR item. In other words its part getting lucky. Theres no real solid answer for this question.,Flipping,cuzrc5f,2,t5_2y9q6

5313603,1,t1_cvqqbug,On the fence?  He sent me a defective item.  What would you have done?  Where was I unreasonable?  I asked for a return for a defective item and he said no then he said he would if I paid a bunch of fees for it.  Why should I have to pay insurance to return a broken item? By itself I agree I wouldnt even list it.  As part of a list of complaints yeah.  Amazon policy states I have to buy insurance to return any item over .  Thats what I agreed to do.  Im not going to pay money out of pocket for a return on an item thats under .  I will return it with tracking and it will not be on my dime.   I was expected to pay shipping to me shipping back to the seller  restocking fee AND the insurance just for him to accept the return of his broken item.    The real problem is he should have taken and processed the return himself as he is required.  I didnt have time to spend on the phone or wait for a manufacture replacement.  This was an item that I lost several hundred dollars on because it came dead.  I was now stuck without the tool I needed for my job and he was dicking around with a return and calling the manufacturer was also too long.  I had a new one in my hand Monday morning so I could leave to work before this guy had even said hed take the return only if I paid the extra crap he wanted.  He should have exchanged or refunded me after he got his old one and handled the manufacture issue on his own.  Had it not arrived dead then yes I obviously would have called the manufacturer.  I am an incredibly active person on Amazon.  I have over  non pantry items over   individual shipments ordered in the last  months.   I have filed one A to Z claim requested a missing accessory needed twice and returned another  items.  Half a percent of my orders have resulted in an A to Z claim and . percent of my orders result in me even messaging the seller with a problem.  I can tell people all the terrible things I want to about this guy its not going to affect his online business at all.  The only way his online business will be affected is if hes not following amazons rules.  So although yes I wish ill will upon his business for being a twat its not like I can create the conditions needed for it to happen. ONLY the seller can do that.  Lastly the principle man. I bust my ass  hours a week sourcing and sending shit to amazon.  Ill be damned if I am going to follow the rules for all of my customers and then get hosed by some jackass for .  Im going to follow the process that every other buyer should follow in the same shoes.  In this particular case the seller doubled down on everything and lost.  ,Flipping,cvqvip7,-4,t5_2y9q6

Whaaaat?May I ask why you think somewhere in the middle is ideal? I always refund on amazon within  days.  Never after.  Sometimes people are just wrong.  I dont do compromise on contracts.  Dont make the deal if you cant follow it.  It isnt as if there are any unreasonable terms on Amazon or Ebay for customer or buyer.  Let me ask you this.  When was the last time you sent a bunk item to a customer and they let you keep the money?  Keep ANY of the money?    I always refundtake return or whatever if I am at fault at all.  mislisted an item a piece was missing maybe something was broken etc.  Thats it and in those cases I am also obligated to as the system should require and does.  What is wrong with the simple premise that people simply do what they agreed to do? When you go above and beyond on ebay or amazon youre benefiting no one except the other person who is asking for an exception to the rules because they dont want them to apply to them.  I do not believe I should take a penny of loss from a customer.  I never agreed to that.  I disagree on this from a business point from a personal responsibility point to an honesty point.

Also flipping is an inherently unstable job.  For the sake of this discussion I will omit wholesaleretail relationships and private label arrangements as those are most definitely more businesslike than what we term flipping.  You are basically hoping to find something of value somewhere and hoping that someone somewhere else will see this thing of value that you have found and offer you money for it with your livelihood pinned to the hope that you survive in the margins between item cost sales price and myriad fees picking your pocket along the way.So sometimes things like health insurance fall to the wayside in favor of food and shelter etc.,Flipping,czjav64,1,t5_2y9q6

Issue is Ive only had  defective order and that was over a year ago. Both my short and long term categories are  for defects too. Ive had over  orders in the last  months as well. My seller account is also in good status.Ive contacted seller performance every other day for  weeks and no one has contacted me back. I contact seller support and they give me the run around while ignoring that I should be able to list in these categories.I now face a new issue where I listed some DS consoles for FBA and they were restricted for the same reason blocked after being processed.

6754830,0,t1_d0hz4ri,I use Firefox and Ive noticed when creating a listing in the web form it often repopulates the weight field with whatever I used previously. Maybe its different in other browsers but that is probably why you are seeing incorrect shipping weights. But with domestic shipping if youre offering free shipping it really doesnt matter how much you put in for the weight when you make the listing. When the item sells the seller puts in the correct weight in the create shipping label screen. I try to remember to set the correct weight for international sales because I dont offer international free shipping and the weight and package dimensions can affect those buyers. But for domestic free shipping as long as it goes by the same delivery method it doesnt matter whether it has  pound or  pounds.As for printing off a label without enough postage it depends. Sometimes USPS will drop it off on your doorstep a few days later. Then you have a buyer wondering why they didnt get their package in two days like theyre supposed to. Or they will actually ship it to the delivering post office and the buyer gets hit with a notice to come down and pay the extra postage. Ive seen it happen both ways and both result in an unhappy buyer and problems for you. So dont do it.,Flipping,d0i089b,2,t5_2y9q6

6778510,0,t1_d0km7m2,FBA is fulfillment by Amazon and MF is merchant fulfilled.  If you didnt send the items in to Amazons warehouses you are merchant fulfilling them.As far as the difference between a standard and pro account the pro account costs  a month but it saves you a  fee per item so if you are selling more than  items a month it makes sense to get a pro account.  Feedback isnt the same on Amazon as it is on eBay.  If you are using fba you will simply be competing with other fba sellers for the same items.  Buyers rarely if ever look at feedback in that case.  If you are merchant fulfilling you will be competing with other mf sellers BUT you will also be competing with the fba sellers.  Many Amazon customers just blindly add to their cart so whomever has the buy box gets the sale.  However there are also many customers who will check out the third party sellers.  Thats in quotes because the majority of customers dont realize that much of what they think they are buying from Amazon is coming from third party sellers because it is FBA.So.....to answer your question no.  I wouldnt take it off of Amazon just because others have more feedback.  If you are competitive in price yours will still sell though it just may take longer if you are merchant fulfilling.  ,Flipping,d0kmm2o,3,t5_2y9q6

7034420,0,t3_4bz9su,Well it depends. If you have researched past sales and have noticed that the only way it will sell is with free shipping then probably the best plan is to price your item between the longest shipping and the shortest shipping plan for whatever courier you go with. However the market dictates the price so if for say a wii gibson guitar hero goes all day long for  with free shipping I know thats not what they go for I am just using it as an example and that seems to be the only way it sells then you have to price yours like that if you hope to sell it quickly. Yeah I mean it totally sucks when I get someone on the West coast wanting something when I am on the east coast because its the max shipping cost and I end up making much less then I had hoped for.

If the buyer changed his mind and wants to keep it or they just forget about it you can call eBay to have the return closed in your favor once their shipping deadline has passed. Leaving the case open with no action taken is a risk on your part because they can escalate it whenever they want.The second case if it was within your stated return policy time then you have to take it back. However you can set up your returns so that all buyers remorse returns are charged a restocking fee.

7267785,1,t1_d247uxz,Yeah I used to think the same way. RA is okay if you do it on the side for fun or beer money but at the end of the day youre not really making as much as you think you are and you are taking a bigger risk than you think you are.You start off with Amazing margins and unlimited potential. Then you realize that there are hundreds of people doing exactly what you are and more are joining every day. Then start the price wars where a  item when you scanned it becomes a  item when it gets to the warehouse. So you think you will play the long game but the price never recovers so youre stuck with inventory piling up in the warehouse and longterm storage fees that you didnt realize you were incurring on the item you are already selling at break even.Then theres the constant risk of getting your account suspended because you have hundreds of random SKUs that you really know nothing about because you spent like  seconds looking at the item and scanning the UPC.Trust me when you try to make it anything more than a way to make some money on the side it gets ugly real fast.,Flipping,d24aoy9,2,t5_2y9q6

7777194,0,t3_4luf4d,Yes they do make fake dickies. Doesnt sound to me like the buyer is scamming you as theyre willing to provide photos of the differences. You yourself said you arent an expert on dickies.As a personal example a couple weeks ago I purchased a Bose noise canceling headset. The seller said they got it at a thrift store tested it. When it arrived I knew it was fake as I have another pair here however I can see how people could get duped. If you didnt know the chrome was a bit too shiny and the patent numbers werent correct the noise cancelation worked but it wasnt the same the leather was a bit cheaper. I could see people thinking they were genuine especially if you had nothing to compare it to.Have the buyer send you the photos and describe whats different. At that point youll have more information as calling full of shit at this point is pretty unfair since you admit not being an expert. Get the information and then come back here. Post the photos and ask for opinions and then continue from there. Making a blanket decision at this point isnt going to do you any favors.Edit If you do determine its fake willfully take the return and provide the label if you want the pants back. If he starts a return as counterfeit then eBay will let him get a refund and keep the item. To me Im also thinking its a legit case as hes explaining the situation. If he was fishing for a refund he would immediately do a case as counterfeit.,Flipping,d3q7bs0,13,t5_2y9q6

I was going to school and then gave up in the middle of my second semester.  Then I did nothing for months living off of what little savings I had and credit cards.   Pulling myself out of this makes me want to crawl in a hole and die.  Flipping is really great because of the total flexibility but therein lies its curse.  Total flexibility  total accountability.  Most days I would rather lie down in traffic than list items.   Its not for everyone and its not something I excel at doing.   In fact I was really fortunate my new job kind of fell into my lap because finding a new job was something I hadnt even attempted in my downward spiral.   Structure and accountability can be motivating for the clinically depressed though sometimes this can backfire.I would suggest if youre up for some advice figuring out if you want to help yourself this is keyif you dont want to nothing you try will work and how to do so.  This will likely involve lots of trial and error that may or may not make things ultimately worse temporarily.   When my medication was effective things were a lot better.   Im not solely suggesting meds there are lots of other things to try as well.,Flipping,d4s7ksr,1,t5_2y9q6

Your price  shipping is over  higher than same items being sold by other sellers.  Maybe your item will eventually sell at ask but it definitely will not be fast.  Consider grouping like items and doing a lot to save yourself shipping and possibly get these mugs to move faster. Picture quality is only ok.  Take better qualityclearerfocused pictures.  You have  free pictures dont be afraid to use them.  Take pictures from all angles especially the gold trim so potential buyers can feel confident of condition. Consider adding dimensions to your listing.  Certainly wouldnt hurt and could definitely help.

Or are they just returning the item not reordering and are out  bucks  their time?  That just doesnt pass the logic test.  The dropshipper and the real seller are selling identical items with identical listings.  The same person is always responsible for the packing wrapping and shipping no matter who sold it as they all come from the same source.It appears that the argument for this is simply they return it because they found out it was cheaper on Ebay.  The net benefit to the customer is a max of around  dollars.  Im having a hard time believing that a bunch of people are doing this over  bucks.  Plus if you look at his THIRTY day return history where hes gone after dropshippers and presumably has helped curb them to say the last year or lifetime you can see that he has a higher negative review rating on that item by  to  percent now than he did with all the dropshippers.  It can certainly be one or the other but it cant be both.  If the dropshippers were why his returns and bad ratings were why did that increase now instead of go down?Im completely with you on the increase of sales should be a proportional increase of returns that should be identical or damn near close to what it is with just him as a seller.

9363040,0,t3_58om05,I did this for a few years got to a point where I found my groove and was starting to make some decent money and was working towards making it a legit business and not just side income.There is a lot of good advice posted already. The main points I can emphasize are find your niche and dont try to tackle the whole market and if you arent already skilled in this field dont expect it to be a huge cash flow overnight not to say that you cant learn as you go. I am self taught and made a pretty good run of it.Ill tell you more about how things went for me but it may be a longish read...Ive always had a technical aptitude my parents tell stories about how when I was a kid a week after Christmas Id have taken apart and reassembled any toys or gadgets I got to see how they worked. I remember them freaking out when I took apart our first family computer when I was around ten. At  I taught myself to solder so I could install a mod chip in my Dreamcast. First job at  I started in sales at an electronics retailer and was in charge of the PC repair desk in short order. I got burned out on that after a couple years because I found that I really didnt like doing software work and most of what we got was virus removal data backups and hard drive wipes.I went into another branch of sales and at some point I had an iPod that failed. I researched how to fix it and ended up putting in an upgraded hard drive and battery at the same time. I realized then that I could afford nicer gadgets by fixing cheap broken stuff I was also in college at the time and had a tight budget. I went onto cell phones next first one I remember was a water damaged Treo that I never wouldve afforded in working condition. Soon I was repairing and flipping iPods and cell phones for extra money Id buy them on craigslist and eBay usually only sold on eBay because trying to sell on craigslist ate up too much time. I also tried briefly to offer repairs locally but again it took more time and I found it better to focus on items that I was reasonably confident I could fix economically based on symptoms rather than diagnosing stuff people brought to me that often wasnt worth fixing.Eventually iPods and phones got to be too much trouble too hard to disassemble fix and reassemble without damaging or ruining them as they got thinner and smaller and in some cases Apple were intentionally made more difficult to fix. A good friend of mine was working for a TV repair company at the time and talking with him got me interested in that. Again though TVs were big and clunky and I was stuck dealing locally. I did transition to smaller LCD TVs and monitors for a while and settled into working on stuff that could be shipped reasonably.Where I really found my niche was doing boardlevel work on high dollar parts. I did a lot of Macs which I could usually make  profit on each one. I also got into motherboards for business computers and servers. These are often odd form factors and cant be swapped with any old offtheshelf board. I mainly stuck to Dell and HP buying new motherboards from them usually cost a few hundred bucks but I could usually repair them for less than  in parts and about an hour including testing. I made some contacts in large offices this way who would send  boards at a time which was a lot more efficient for me than selling individuals on eBay. Id still do individual sales to fill the times that I wasnt working on big orders and sometimes Id have existing clients or word of mouth referrals who would ask me to check out an oddball model. Branching out and trying stuff I wasnt familiar with helped keep things interesting and led to expanding my business. I dedicated my second bedroom to being a workshopoffice and had shelves of random stuff I picked up that seemed interesting or challenging to work on when it was slow. I did a fair bit of projectors too the main thing I had to watch out for there was cost of replacement lamps that could often eat my entire margin.The biggest drag and time sink for me was running the business side of things. I loved the technical work not so much the record keeping packing and shipping listing stuff on eBay etc. I was lucky to have a girlfriend at the time who encouraged me and helped out with some of that stuff. What led to it failing was the increasing difficulty of being able to reliably repair things most of the stuff I was working on regularly I had a near  success rate but as more and more went to surface mount components and particularly BGA chips I needed more expensive equipment for repairs and had a higher failure rate a proper BGA rework rig at the time could run thousands of dollars and on top of that the only way to be completely sure of your repair is to xray the chipboard. I offered a one year warranty on my work so I just factored it into cost of doing business that sometimes I had to redo some comebacks. What ultimately killed it for me though was some health problems that took me out for a couple months I lost a lot of business and regular clients during that time and never really recovered from it had to go back to a working stiff job just to get some income flowing after being laid up for so long.Sorry for the long ramble I hope it helps though to show some of the pitfalls some strategies for success and maybe help to explain whats needed to get started. If you want to make real money at it its all about volume. Most boards I would net  and it was only after a lot of experience that I could crank them out in an hour. Tack on the time to photograph and list your items then packing and shipping and suddenly your hourly rate isnt much especially if youre paying taxes on the income you make from it. Starting out flipping I didnt have a lot of money to put into it so Id start with say five items sell them and buy ten more and so on. If you dont have much to put in up front and build up your inventory prepare to be patient and put as much of your profit back into your business as possible. It is also a big help if you already have the proper tools mainly a good soldering iron not the junk they sell at Radio Shack and a decent multimeter in addition to the usual screwdrivers pry tools a few picks tweezers etc. From there youll figure out what you need with experience. Oh and one other thing that was mentioned above if you acquire something that you cant fix or cant fix economically cracked LCD panels on anything are a good example you can often recoup some of your cost by parting out what you know works. If I got a monitor or TV with a busted panel but otherwise working I could still sell the power supply inverter board and main board and sometimes the stand and remote when applicable. It may take a while but eventually someone is going to need that part.Anywho good luck! If you have any other questions Im happy to help!,Flipping,d92tz9o,2,t5_2y9q6

Cash vs. accrual is a bit different. Heres a good example On December th you paid for Januarys rent. The cash method is when you recognize incomeexpense when cash moves. For the cash method the rent expense is recorded in December since thats when the cash moved. If you are using the accrual method youre trying to match up expenses to their actual usage. Even though you paid in December you record the expense in January because its for Januarys rent. Think of a more extreme example if you paid rent for the next  years in advance. You have a huge expense in year  but much fewer expenses in years . It would be deceiving to investors or creditors if you modified income in that way.

Good niche of you know what youre doing. And you absolutely must know what you are doing especially when dealing in high end gear. Something as simple as a bit of haze or fungus can devastate your value and in general there is little margin for error when picking. I sell locally and via eBay for more obscure items. I generally test basic functions but rarely put a roll of film through unless its a big ticket item or just for fun. My advice is deal in purely mechanical cameras. If it needs a battery its just one more thing to deal with. In general if theres an issue with the body and I cant test it Ill pass unless a dirt cheap b I can fix it c brand power. If the camera needs a battery that no longer exists skip it. Obsolete film types generally ignore unless the camera is aesthetically pleasing or has an antique feel to it. Must still function!Polaroids with the rainbow stripe ALWAYS sell. Just be patient. But same rules apply. It must work. If you wanna play in the big league e.g. leica Hasselblad etc you better know your shit or youll get burned.

My cousin and I would also bug relatives for old books and trade them into a local store here that also sells video games then buy video games. At  I was on a gaming forum and was in the right place at the right time to get added to a private group of people who flip games and learned a lot from them. Then I started to bug my parents to drive me to pawn shops and thrift stores and store clearances. My dad was happy about my entrepreneurial spirit and did. That group eventually died out after a few years as the store clearances died out and the advent of smartphones caused more competition making flipping just video games not a viable thing anymore.

11160345,0,t3_5zbisx,January   Junior year of college. My girlfriend asked me to take her textbooks to the university bookstore to sell back along with mine. They wanted to give me  cents on the dollar for what I paid which just pissed me off.So I went back home and tried to see if I could sell them online. I sold them all very quickly on eBay and Half.com and for much more money than I would have at the college bookstore. Then I found a large stack of books sitting on a table outside of a classroom with a big sign that said free. I took all of those and sold them too. Then I started putting out fliers hitting up the university message boards and going on Craigslist and buying every damn textbook I could get my hands on from students who were trying to get rid of them. I paid them more than the bookstore would have so they were happy and then I flipped them for a good amount of profit online so I was happy. From there I formed an LLC and started buying from the publishers and selling online too.And thus a flipper was born. ,Flipping,dex0hdb,1,t5_2y9q6

You dont have to only sell those things but if you start with something you are personally passionate about then you have an extra reason to jump into the process.Once you know what you want to sell go to you tube and type in reselling item. Watch everything you can on the topic. Go to google and do them same thing and read what ever information you can on the topic. Then do the same thing for where to buy item How to Fix Item How to ship Item. Go to ebay and check the completed listings for your selected categories and scroll through everything. Look at the way they are pictured read the descriptions. Sort them by price for highest first so that you can skip the junk dealers and the people who dont know how to make money. See what kind of average price people are getting.  Then go out and test the waters. If its something you can pick up at the local thrift store or do retail arbitrage on then go to your local thrift stores or walmart and look for it.  Find an estate sale that has a lot of what you are looking to buy and go there. www.estatesales.net is a good place to start for that. If you are doing this part time then you have the luxury of starting slow and should use it to your advantage. Once you are comfortable with that item try the same thing with another item.
