They also said they have quite a few patients who have to get both eyes shot. Ive had around   shots so far L eye only.  FWIW use the hell out of your moistening drops  min right after a shot every  min thereafter for several hours. Makes a world of diff in comfort!    Good luck to you! lt ,maculardegeneration,dgd3bhe,1,t5_2qq2k
