250848,0,t3_1wylyv,Fantastic idea! This is the kind of thing I was hoping for since starting this sub. If you get some great results on your month of experimentation I would like to add some of your techniques to the upcoming Wiki.Ill help start things off with suggestions by sharing a technique I use to improve photo engraving. Many materials dont respond well to low power engraving and high power removes too much material at times. My solution to this has been to take my material usually wood and spray paint a coat or two of color or black paint on it. Once dry engraving with enough power to remove the paint makes for a much higher contrast image and has the added benefit of a touch of color. This works on glass too but its tricky to get the power and speed settings just right.Heres an example of the technique done on a piece of scrap Lauan plywood. Not the best wood by any measure but the detail is amazing IRL.Thanks for posting your creations. I eagerly await them all!,lasercutting,cf6r6my,1,t5_2xhcs

5869230,0,t3_3vn6w4,Well given that youre using a laser beam to burn things...youre going to have to be a little more specific about the details? SWhen do you smell it? Is it when things are cutting or when the machine is on but youre not cutting?Does it smell like the material youre cutting? Acrylicplexiglass smells like superglue in case you dont know.To answer the best I can with the little information provided For the stock K assuming youre simply smelling what youre cutting Id say Probably normal.  Theres lots of holes in the thing that need to be covered for the best exhaust performance. I havent taken care of that on mine yet either.Also Check and make sure you arent burning the table or whatever youve got the laser on through the hole in the bottom of the chassis right under the bed.  I remember stumbling on a post somewhere in which somebody was tracking down the source of a burning smell and found out theyd been lightly etching their table through that hole in the chassis haha...,lasercutting,cxozjbo,3,t5_2xhcs
5982958,0,t1_cy3pm9i,Your kerf was set too high. In a properly designed box the tabs SHOULDNT fit in the drawing. Since the beam itself has width you need to make the tab drawings wider than the slot drawings. When the nonzerothickness laser beam cuts the material the edge of the cut mark will be offset from the beams center location. If the marks align in your software then the box will be too loose and wont hold together well.,lasercutting,cy3wazv,4,t5_2xhcs

9180799,0,t1_d8fmeil,first of all  thank you very much for such a thoughtful comment. and this makes a lot of sense as to why youre worried. I think the difference is that visible light damages the retina. C lasers are not in the visible spectrum and the concern is much more about damaging the surface of the eye or skin. Basically C lasers are stopped by water.  I have not heard of or experienced personally of any issues having to do with retinal damage with C. Now that being said  I really get when youre comparing it to wattage levels of laser pointer  and I agree Id be fiercely concerned when comparing it to the damagemW level.  I also agree that it probably doesnt help to have me post cavalier comments about it being a big deal. I have heard for example YAG is extremely dangerous. One shot and your eye is gone. So I think its time for me to stop pushing the point  and again thank you for such a well considered comment. ,lasercutting,d8fqf3t,1,t5_2xhcs

10213468,0,t1_dc1jmxi,Kerf in general may have no fixed definition but the hourglass itself does have a fixed definition even if it is a function of the focal length and the kerf of a given material is going to be a function of the hourglass. So I need to know the hourglass dimensions within the material in order to gauge what the kerf results are going to be.The focal point has to be a function of the gauge positioning somehow otherwise there wouldnt be a gauge there to define that length.You keep using the word image I dont care about images I care about dimensions and part tolerances so for me a workflow that results in the laser being fed a toolpath that produces a part according to the dimensions specified in an AutoCAD document is what matters. Corel neither knows nor cares what kerf is so I have no reason to know or care about Corel. A graphics program is not a solution to my problem.You didnt answer how a frequency higher than the DPI gets applied to a cut. Thank you for confirming the perforation though.Actually yeah it is a CNC CNC stands for Computational Numerical Control which basically means anything driven according to encoder positioning. Perhaps what you meant to say was Its not a milling machine? I would argue that GCode is more than sufficient at doing raster jobs and that GCode omission is more for the sake of reducing cost and eliminating user error from the cutting process than having anything at all to do with being not enough.Not Milimeters Mills! So stuff like the exact shape of the hourglass and where the focal point is within the material really starts to matter.Im looking to cut custom IR photointerrupter encoder wheels about the size of a penny. They will be asymmetrical but Ive mathed them out to have perfect mass and inertial balance given a perfect manufacturing process. The next stage is to introduce geometry to correct for realistic manufacturing constraints like the presence of kerf and interior corner fillets but I need to know what that geometry needs to be first.Im not certain the Zing  has a way to track registration marks that would certainly be helpful. Can I cut the registration marks in one pass and then cut the parts according to the marks?You could certainly help by suggesting an IR blocking plastic that cuts to really reliable tolerances if you know of one.,lasercutting,dc1r64w,1,t5_2xhcs
