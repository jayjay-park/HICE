317184,0,t3_1xq8sh,Googling folding chair dimensions... looks like a normal folding chair is about x inches. Lets say that to move comfortably along the rows you need  inches of space between a row of chairs. So from above you would see    CCCCCC    CCCCCC    CCCCCC    CCCCCCWhere C is a x chair and  is a  foot gap. This gives you a X inch rectangle as your unit. Not knowing the dimensions of your room Im going to make a guess its a rectangle with a ratio of . for the sides. That is the short side is  the length of the long side This lets us go with .x. foot or x foot room. Keep in mind we are just trying to fill this space with as many chairs as we can. Im not leaving a center isle or a space at the front of the room for a speaker to stand. You are just gonna have row after row of chairs from wall to wall.So chair is X inchesRoom is .x. feet or .x inches.A row of chairs side by side can be at most .    . so  chairs wide and   . so  chairs deep. That means you could put  chairs in this floor space. You might wanna leave some chairs out otherwise the fire marshal might want a room with you.   ,theydidthemath,cfdn8lq,6,t5_2x23b

918399,0,t3_24mbk6,The question is actually a lot more difficult to answer than assuming each base site can be any of the four bases and therefore raising four to a power. Portions of coding DNA such as promoters are highly conserved from person to person and even from person to plant. A certain base may have a  fidelity rate and maybe the other  is one other base. Without the specified sequences in these locations whole protein could cease to be expressed. Mess with too many and it wouldnt take long for the organism to not be human. Aside from coding DNA there are other considerations such as number tandem repeats which vary with enough specificity to be used as genetic identification. Then you come to the problem of what is considered a mutation or an abnormality. While OP probably isnt looking for this in the calculation throw in expression modifications and the calculation becomes even more difficult.Altogether the number is likely exponentially lower than those posted here but also probably nearly impossible to calculate. A lot whole genome comparisons would need to be done to determine normal sequence variation probabilities protein expressions would have to be taken for each gene to see how many of these base pair variations could exist together without messing up the protein and then you could calculate all the possible variations across genes.Sorry for the lack of an answer I dont think anyone has one.,theydidthemath,ch8oevg,3,t5_2x23b

1287240,0,t1_cieagbz,That statement is technically correct but wrong in magnitude. What I mean is that the distance is too small for this to matter. Lets actually calculate this distance. Lets say we take the first part t of a second after the sudden stop. Where would an object be that was once exactly on the surface of the Earth. We use a very similar calculation. You are at the top of a circle of radius R moving tangentially to the right along the xdirection. Your tangential movement with no gravity would be described by a straight line y R. Now as you move along this line you get farther from the surface of the Earth. The distance from you to the closest surface to you will be a little line segment from you towards the center of the Earth. Lets say you travel distance x along the tangential line. The distance from you to the center of the Earth is equal to sqrtRx from the Pythagorean theorem Therefore the distance from you to the ground beneath you is height h  sqrtRxR. Now x  v t where v is your tangential velocity and t is the time since the sudden stop. At the equator you are moving at about v   ms or . kms. R   km. t   milisecond   s. Here x  . km. Your height above the ground is . x  meters! Thats less than the thickness of a cell membrane or the size of a transistor gate on a modern cpu processor. t   s. Here x  . m  . km. Your height h  . x  m t   s. Here were in the realm of actually being able to register whats going on. Here x  . m and h  . x  m or about s of an inch. t   s. Here we have h  . cm. Its something we can actually get a feel for. Still its a small distance.For that  second youve moved up a nearly imperceptible distance away from the Earth while you moved half a km thataway. Your shoes and feet havent had the time to come off the ground while you already traveled something like  meters.Also we need to mention that gravity is still acting on you in that first  second and has pulled you  meters closer to the ground meaning you are on the ground the whole time! You might ask what kind of tangential velocity do we require to actually come off the ground and feel it.Lets say that that height needs to be at least  inch to make a difference. This also means that the gravity on the planet must not pull you in fast enough to bring you down. So thats  inch net difference. Near the surface of the planet the amount the gravity is pulling you down is equal to  g t whatever the g for that planet is. You want The above h minus this quantity to be at least an inch. To also feel it well say t   s. You havesqrtRt v  R  g t   inchWe can solve this for v and get v   ms. That is you need to be traveling at above the Earth orbital velocity before the planet stops abruptly in order to feel that  inch movement in  s. You can of course loosen up the definition a bit and say we can do  inch in  second but then youll still drag on the ground for the majority of that  second. The calculation comes to v   which is still the orbital velocitytldr the distance is tiny it doesnt matter and youll still eat dirt before getting airborn even if the planet were rotating at orbital velocity. Although such a planet would have a much easier access to space. Itll be kind of hard to stay down.,theydidthemath,ciefins,2,t5_2x23b

1837856,0,t3_2fmk11,Are you talking about the password strength comic by xkcd?It was basically saying a longer password is better and instead of using symbols and stuff which make no difference to a computer you should just use a long password that you as a human can remember without making it confusing.If a computer is brute forcing a password symbols will just be classed as another character to check therefore do not make a difference for password strength.

1840129,0,t1_ckany3k,Thats my site.  I made it a long time ago when most password strength testers just gave you points based on how many different types of characters you would use which was absurd.  Since then others have noticed how bad those checkers were and made much better versions than mine.This one in particular is my go to.With respect to your question I think the issue is that generally increasing the character types will make your password harder to crack.  However it will also make it harder to remember.  Youll be better off just adding another random word to the end of your password than to start changing letters to symbols.  Particularly if you add a word that isnt in a common word listThe way you calculate how many possible combinations there are is number of possibilities for each spot to the power of how many spots there are.  For a  digit pin that gives   .  For  lower case letters that gives   .  You can see how adding more possibilities or length both dramatically increase the total.  In the case of words you must consider that an attacker can just use combinations of whole words instead of combinations of characters.  So you must consider each word as one spot.  A password of  words from the  most common list will have    possibilities which is just a bit more than the possibilities with  of the  characters you can easily type with a keyboard.,theydidthemath,ckaxkec,2,t5_2x23b

2404978,0,t3_2mwif7,Hi. So some of my colleagues pointed out this post to me. I dont know why everyone keeps making the mistake of saying the black hole is not rotating. This is not a mere assumption that one can do away with it is a fundamental one! The gravitational time dilation equation as posted above by DptBear comes from the Schwarzschild metric for an observer at distance R from the black hole this situation simply does not apply here.The point of having a rotating black hole and using the Kerr geometry is that the metric tensor of the Kerr metric has a nonvanishing crossterm that cannot be transformed away by ANY suitable coordinate transformation i.e. the differential rotation of the black hole is real and cannot be assumed away. Phil Plait made this mistake and many others are just finding equations off of different websites that remotely look like they are related to time dilation and are just doing raw calculations and then they claim they have disproved Kip it is wrong to do this.I have posted the correct calculation on my blog which some of you have seen,theydidthemath,cm8ypmt,2,t5_2x23b
2418127,0,t3_2n4oow,What we knowThere are less then  giraffes left in the wild. They consume about  kg of food per day. Since they eat both the leaves and the twigs maybe around  of that is actually leaves. So at best they consume about  kg of leaves every year. On average a tree produces  pounds  kg of oxygen per year. A person uses around  lkg of oxygen per year for perspective.Now we need to figure out how much oxygen does a  kg of leaves produce every year. And not just any leaves Acacia leaves giraffes primary source of food which are not actually leaves at all but are most often phyllodes but they serve the same purpose. Short of walking outside and looking for an acacia tree weighing the leaves count them and repeat the process many time in order to find an average there is no real way for me to go any further. I would also then need to create an experiment to find out the amount of oxygen each leaves produces and then repeat this under many different conditions in order to find out the average once again. If anyone can dig up these information then you can probably solve this with the already given data.As for my personal opinion in the long term the extinction of giraffes would lower the amount of oxygen produced instead of increasing it. Giraffes help spread acacia seeds and play a role in pollination thus ensuring that there will be more plants to produce oxygen. ,theydidthemath,cmal86q,2,t5_2x23b

This effect arises neither from technical aspects of the clocks nor from the fact that signals need time to propagate but from the nature of spacetime itself.gtgtImage i  Time dilation explains why two working clocks will report different times after different accelerations.

Sounds like you either were dealing directly with the adjuster or your computer was a bit too old. Likely they didnt find a computer with the same or similar specs which is a big nono andor your computer had depreciated quite a bit. Depending on the computer its life expectancy could have been anywhere from  to  years if I remember correctly. So if the projected life expectancy was  years then a  year old computer would depreciate at  of its replacement cost. Therefore the computer they cited as their price point could have been  but depreciation would bring it to .,theydidthemath,cn2sfzj,2,t5_2x23b

That way they will be fed and will be working although we may not really need what they have to give. Maybe make it a charity thing where you buy the thing and the money is used to buy their food and such. Thirty dollar handmade beaded necklace? I think this sort of thing is already happening somewhere. But really you need to get them to learn to do something the rest of the world wants.

Clearly the water has to be moving at a very low speed for this to be possible at all. If we assume the water was stagnant obviously it isnt since this is a waterfall but it gives us an idea of the minimum necessary windspeed then that term can be ignored. By looking at the picture the cross sectional area of the plume seems to be about two or three times the area of the stream a short distance from the edge if calculated from later downwind we need to account for the momentum of air that blows on this plume. The density is more difficult to calculate but obviously has to fall somewhere between the density of air and water so that ratio must be between  and . Since we just assumed that the flowrate of the water is negligibly small there cant be too much water flowing into the plume and thus we ought to conclude the plume is mostly air. A density of  to  times that of air seems reasonable. Thus for something like this to happen at the minimum air speed would have to be somewhere between  and  times the speed of the plume right at the beginning. Clearly the plume is moving reasonably fast in this video though the assumptions made in this calculation may not be valid in this particular case. That said the plume seems to start out at something like ms so that would mean the wind would have to be between  and  mph in that little crevasse to get it started which seems to be in agreement with uvorins data. ,theydidthemath,cnm4msx,7,t5_2x23b

Unlike our friend down there who sounds like he limited his evolutionary education to lamarkwe will not strive to evolve our bodies to lowered o levels rather we will synthesize suitable micro climates with resources availableassuming a fair number of degreed physical physics and chemistry scientists and biologists survived.Since food would be our first concern we would have to know the proximate cause of the cessation of photosynthesis.if God just magically turned it off wed be in trouble. methylotrophic Organisms get both energy and carbon needed for carbon fixation carbon molecules.Their metabolic approach to life is do different from ours that the molecules they make that are analogous to the ones wethrough the food chain use for nutrition are poisonous to most organisms.it Might be possible to bio engineer those types of organisms and things that predate them in a way that makes them useful to us. Similar things could be done worry archaea that get energy by reducing sulfides.This doesnt sound easy to do in as post apocalyptic environment.If the cause of photosynthesis stopping was something like too much ash in the atmosphere wed be much better off relatively speaking.almost all of the minerals in the earth crust contain or simply are oxides. As the name implies they have oxygen in them.As a matter of fact it used to be atmospheric and with energy and a little chemical know how it can become atmospheric again. Electrolysis of ho also easy. Shelters could be adapted from previous buildings or cave systems to be oxygen rich for us and opposite of whatever stopped photosynthesis outsideassuming it wasnt God decidingphotosynthesis made life to easy for us. Unless it was something that burned all the atmosphere away or the sun vanished or aliens stole all organisms capable of photosynthesis and even then maybe I believe our survival as a species to be highly likely.

Allow me to introduce you to the Infinite Mass PunchThe concept is simple. As your velocity increases so does your mass to the point that if you accelerate to the speed of light your mass becomes infinite and it requires infinite energy to do so.  But The Flash can reach light speed and even pass it. When he punches you at the speed of light it is a punch of literally infinite mass and energy... But from his perspective its just a punch so no it doesnt break his hand. And as he points out theres nothing to stop him punching as many times as he wants to either. He doesnt even need to kill Supes with the punch just knock him far enough away from the sun that he loses his powers.  AFAIK current thinking does not include the idea of mass increasing to infinity as velocity approaches lightspeed just the amount of energy needed. However its still a common belief and the comic book was explicitly using that logic so we can just chalk that up to the differences between DCs reality and our own.,theydidthemath,cobx3in,7,t5_2x23b

3043972,0,t3_2uzfay,The Walt Disney Company reports its financials at the level of Parks and Resorts so to get to an individual resort well have to make some some assumptions and get to a ballpark or is it themepark? number.According to this table from page  of their  annual report the Parks amp Resorts division had a total expenditure of . Billion Im including the OpEx SGampA to account for overheads and also Depreciation to account for the cost of buildingrenovating parks. This includes both International and Domestic Parks. Theyve given the revenue split for International vs. Domestic in the same table . of revenue from US Parks amp Resorts so if we assume the same proportion for costs that leaves us with expenses of .Bn for US Parks and Resorts.This costs should include all the US Theme Parks  Disney Vacation Club  Disney Cruise Line  Adventures by Disney. At this point Im just going to make a wild guess that the big chunk of revenues and costs are from the theme parks themselves say . So that gives us .Bn as expenses for US Parks.One way to estimate the costs for one park would be to prorate based on the size of the park land area. I feel like that would be pretty well correlated with how expense it is to run. Walt Disney World Resort is a ridiculous  Acres and probably costs a hell of a lot more to operate than the Disneyland Resort which is  Acres which is probably much more expensive than Aulani which is only  Acres.Using that approach The Disneyland Resort should be  of US Parks Cost which is Mn. The Disneyland Resort includes the Park and several Hotels.I suspect a good chunk of this actually goes towards running the hotels rather than the park itself.

Typical grains like cornricewheat for pasta come in around half the energy density.So  people will need around  calories per day. This is typical of the low end of developed countries and is a good target to avoid the  level of obese st world countries and  african countries.So anyway that is a total of around  million calories annually or around  acres.Obviously for a more interesting but primarily vegetarian diet you would at around twice that ... so  acres.At a very rough guess for your assumptions Ill say rd from cattle at m cal per acre and rds cornwheat at m cal per acre for an average of .m cal per acre ... or right on  acres.Decent western irrigation would probably double these yields and a full hydroponic system would probably double that again.So hopefully that gives some rough idea.,theydidthemath,cosgqao,3,t5_2x23b

3299793,0,t3_2xvcm8,I used to work in a computer lab when I was in college and I can tell you that the reason why they put caps on prints is because people abuse the hell out of the printing and mostly unintentionally. The printer was the bane of my existence at that job. Every day someone would try and print a couple hundred pages stand at the printer waiting for the job to upload get tired of waiting ask me why it was taking so long may be start randomly pushing buttons or even open the printer then either print the job again or leave in frustration. A few minutes later their job would start printing and back up the entire queue. If I was diligent about watching the printer queue and killing huge jobs so much toner and paper was wasted. Even still we ended up throwing out two or three huge garbage cans full of paper every week. It was just insane.

This works for any number on the dice all one twos ect. because unless you consider the microimperfections each die has then there is no difference statistically speaking between rolling all ones vs twos threes ect.Hope this helped,theydidthemath,csln4ix,1,t5_2x23b

4514118,0,t3_3cv6ls,With everyone talking about how many hours teachers end up working I figured there must be a study out there with real numbers. The best I could find was this analysis. It is based on a time use survey so it is all the time teachers themselves report working on their job including off hours and weekends. The relevant finding is graph . It finds that they work something like . hrs total slightly less than other professionals. This does NOT take in to account any down time for holidays the survey is done on a weekly basis so if the teacher didnt do any work in that week they werent counted. So if summer hours were included the average would likely be somewhat lower.

There are only male adults here with a lung capacity of .L and working on the minimum given breaths per minute in adults of min . Working with standard atmospheric breakdown O at  the minimum amount of oxygen is consumed with each breath at  of total volume of atm  This gives a total consumption of O per L of atm of mLbreathLatm or .L of O consumed for .L lung capacity per breath.  I will also assume that .L of oxygen is req before ill effects occur.. There is of there is NO air flow through the door as there is only one opening any additional oxygen introduced into the system would be only from diffusion which should result in zero flow of air at the top floor. Imagine trying to blow more air into a bottle.So working on these assumptions each breath taken results inOr  V.  tp. where Or is the oxygen remaining V is total volume of the building t is minutes and p is population size.So given the volume of one apartment of m sq floor  and a height of .m  we have an apartment volume of m cubed.If this is inhabited by a single male adult ill effects would be felt at  breaths or  min.Lastly assuming that the oxygen consumption volumes are all correct the brain can survive  min without oxygen  well use .So at min someone on the top floor would be getting sleepy at  min theyre likely to be unconscious and by  min probably brain dead.,theydidthemath,cugjv7t,27,t5_2x23b

5115612,0,t1_cv2iv6h,Some of the notations require a fair amount of explanation which may in turn require a deeper knowledge of mathematics. For example the hash mark  actually goes along with the E as part of a system called Hyper E notation Without jumping into more advanced mathematics we can at least say that the number could also be expressed in another way. For example a smaller number like a million would be E but could be written as . Not much gain in notational efficiency there. But a bit larger number like a googolplex could be written as E rather than   which is starting to get messy. Probably not worth it to the layperson to learn the details of this notation though as it is not entirely straightforward.The brackets  represent arrays. In this case they are part of a system called Bowers Exploding Array Function Once again to understand this notation requires a bit more education than youre going to get in a single Reddit post. But we can say this way of representing numbers is more complicated than a layperson is likely to find useful but it makes for a more compact representation of a very large number as you can imagine if you are writing a paper and constantly referring to very large numbers you dont want to type them all out when you could use a compact notation instead.,theydidthemath,cv2mf8t,2,t5_2x23b

In fact there isnt a single reference that I can see in the article to how much higher the NOx emissions are in these VWs compared to european limits only to american regulations some of which are the harshest in the modern world.  As such which the article notes the diesels on the road in America only account to around  of all cars on the road.Also that last quote is horseshit. Its attributed to all of the m cars driving the same amount as Americans something which doesnt happen considering Americans consistently drive the most out of any country and last I had read the closest competitor Canada drives something like  of the miles that the average American does.

5831773,0,t3_3v3mmg,Looks like a double impact there followed by an immediate explosion. From the angle the first impact involved the shoulder and upper arm striking a metal girder that impact would likely result in damage ranging between a broken clavicle and a merely dislocated shoulder with the angles difficult to make out the additional possibility of damage to the upper arm and ribs or the side of the head either broken bones or the physical removal of the external ear would likely occur.The player character then rebounds from the steelandconcrete construct bouncing headfirst into the metal railing of the nearby catwalk the construction of the walkway in question looks to be sufficient that the impact of some kg conservative approximation dude looks ripped and hes carrying a bit of kit too... of human meat fails to produce even a minimally noticable deflection in the angle of the metal that force is therefore all being applied directly to the skull and thence the spine of the body in question. If as seems likely this being the third game in the series the skull in question has been somehow replaced with titanium or some similar alloy its possible the character could avoid shattering it however the velocity being travelled and the significant and abrupt delta in said v would doubtless cause significant traumatic injury to whatever scraps of brain remain within said skull the angle of impact would likely also be sufficient to strain  if not completely sever  the connective tissue in the vicinity of the c or c vertebrae such an injury is instantly paralyzing and usually fatal as it results in a loss of semivoluntary muscle control over the diaphragm and the lungs as well as complete loss of control over the voluntary muscles of the arms and legs.After that the red barrels? red barrels. explosive material on the raised platform goes off in an enormous fireball. The blast wave from an explosion that size would provide sufficient concussive force to render anyone standing as close as our feckless hero unconscious and suffering from additional traumatic brain injury while the heat from such a blast would likely cause at least second degree burns if hes very very lucky none of the explosive ammunition hes carrying will go off in the heat. An explosion like that will also produce quite noticable amounts of shrapnel the game seems to limit the quantity of debris chunks likely to prevent a prohibitive physics calculation but if we allow for the same sort of abstraction that is used to account for hitscan projectile weapons automatic rifles and the like we can presume that he was struck by between a dozen and three dozen irregularly shaped pieces of jagged metal on the order of cm by mm if we assume the equipment strapped to his back is attached to a kevlar pack its likely that any projectiles on a track for his center of mass would be stopped but the positioning he had when the explosion went off means that projectiles travelling towards the gluteal region would have no such protection to alter their path they would likely penetrate until they expended their kinetic energy upon tissue and organs or until they struck bone while projectiles whose path would intercept his limbs would be effectively unchallanged. In summation the subjects right ear and surrounding skin tissue has been forcibly removed his right collar bone and adjacent ribs quite thoroughly shattered bluntforce trauma has shattered the skull and severed the spinal column and several dozen small pieces of shrapnell penetrated the tissues of the arms legs buttocks and lower back likely damaging the kidneys and intestines should death not immediately result from the brain injuries and blood loss the internal injuries should be expected to go septic immediately due to the admixture of raw sewerage from the perforated intestines death from infection will doubtless result in short order.tldr This isnt the fun kind of youre fuked.,theydidthemath,cxk2ltf,2,t5_2x23b

And its a problem I also agree.But why do you think someone is entitled to something they cant afford?  If you cant afford a room why should you just get one?  Who pays for it?  Taxpayers?  If someone cant afford to live amp work in an expensive city they should look for work elsewhere that they can afford.  Theres no reason that they have to live in SF other than they want to live in SF I mean who doesnt? Its a gorgeous cityI fully support raising the minimum wage so that more workers can afford to live where they work.You still havent given any practical solutions to the problems you keep stating of housing unaffordability... which again I do agree is a problem.

That cuts down the problem significantly i.e. makes it actually solvable.We know how many particles there are in a gram of matter due to experiments here on earth.  We know that overwhelmingly most of the ordinary matter in the universe is concentrated in stars.  We know what the average mass of a star is through our observations.  We have a pretty good idea of how many stars there are in the observable universe too.  Its a fairly simple math problem to just multiply it all out.However the monkey wrench in the whole thing is dark matter.

6075145,0,t3_3ymliv,Since there have been no answers yet Ill give it a try using Newtons Impactor equation provided by a nowdeleted comment. If Im understanding this correctly velocity can be neglected for high speed projectiles using the impactor equation The end answer then wont be a speed unfortunately but we can at least see if the projectile could have penetrated all of the material in theory.Using glass  . gcm   panes each about .mm thick .mm aluminum  . gcm   walls each estimated at .mm thick .mm water   gcm  about .mm thick. Putting this together our projectile needs to penetrate .mm of material averaging to about .gcm density. If we call the projectile lead and about  of an inch long we get a potential depth through a material of this depth of about . inches or about .mm. This means that approximating the the bullet as a lead cylinder .mm long and all the stuff it went through as a solid chunk of material of the average material density the bullet could pass through about . times as much material as it went through. TLDR using very rough approximations assuming my math checks out its theoretically possible.,theydidthemath,cyfxrb0,2,t5_2x23b

7723477,0,t1_d3k25xu,Well there are subsonic bullets that are manufactured so if you had something capable of moving the speed of sound it could outpace them. Again assuming instant acceleration or a great enough starting distance to build up speed.But in most cases yes you are correct.Heres an exampleLets say you have a shooter with a rifle and a bullet designed to be fired with a muzzle velocity exactly at the speed of sound . ms. He is aiming at a person standing at a long distance lets say  meters.Lets also for the sake of simplicity ignore air resistance which would make this a lot harder. That means the bullet will maintain its muzzle velocity  ms and our target wont be affected by dragons it moves.When the shooter pulls the trigger it will take the bullet . seconds to reach the target. If the target intended to outrun the bullet they would have to instantaneously see and cognitively process the firing of the bullet and begin moving the opposite direction. I just looked up that Olympic sprinters generally react to the starting signal at around . to . seconds not a perfect comparison because they hear the signal where we would have to just know it. So assuming the low end we now have . seconds before the bullet has reached our position. Thats not a lot of wiggle room so lets cheat a little and assume that we can accelerate at the land acceleration record of . ms to reach our top speed which will again be the speed of sound. This would take only . seconds! Mind you that speed record was set with an electric super car so dont get too excited but we can all dream.That all means that at . seconds from firing you would be safely moving at the same speed of the bullet which would be hot on your trail about  meters behind you. Close shave considering thats only about . seconds of difference.  Good news Since there is no air resistance you just need to keep running long enough for Gravity to pull the bullets trajectory to the ground. Bad news You would be accelerating at a gforce of  however which is  to put it nicely  not sustainable.All of this to say that it would probably be much easier to accelerate perpendicular to the flight of the bullet to get out of the way. Still probably not possible in a real life scenario due to the cognitivesensory limitation and the inability to accelerate fast enough even to the side.Of note  this is an extraordinarily slow bullet in this example. Many will travel at x this speed. There is a very small market for bullets which are just under the sound barrier for their silenced application but most are much much faster.,theydidthemath,d3k3u2e,2,t5_2x23b

8331875,0,t1_d5ggs81,Youre missing a few things The wall is way too thin and also too short. I would go  thick and  high since I have a  ladder in my garage. So cost of concrete can go up by  just for the wall.  You would need to anchor this wall. Since this is probably a lot of sand you would want a  wide footing for it to sit on which would be at least  thick. So theres basically the cost of your concrete again. Were at x now.    Rebar. Lots and lots of rebar. Setting this up could easily take a labourer  day per foot of wall so without materials its  million days at your  ish per day  another  million just for rebar labour at minimum wage.  But minimum wage? Really? In Canada I pay a GC hour for carpenters and other moderately skilled trades. Cut that in half and youre still triple your math. So it would be closer to  billion in labour for rebar setup alone.  Thats not include taking out the sand underneath and adding gravel packing it leveling it adding proper drainage... And to say nothing of forms. This would be done in sections with a form for the footing then another pour for the wall itself built in sections. So much for the wall itself. Now this aint exactly level terrain and you gotta get cement trucks in. So welcome to roadbuilding . I have no idea how to build roads on sand but its gotta be a few feet of crushed stone. Then you need to mix the concrete within an hour of pouring so add another cost for building cement depots and industrial mixers which at  mph you would need one every  km or  along the way. The old number of  billion seems like a good start but remember that this would be a government contract with no rational basis.

When I googled ketosis to make sure it was the definition I gave.Yeah lowering your carb intake in my experience is the easiest way to lose weight. I have never been healthier weight wise than when I was counting carbs so I could learn the carbs in general food items when she was first diagnosed.For all carbs are we talking literally anything that breaks down and is called a carbohydrate or are we talking simple carbs like sugars and then maybe just general breads and pastas? In other words easy carbs. Cause either way if youre burning fats and proteins instead of carbs your body is producing ketones. And having WAY too many ketones can be really bad for you.I am interested though does insulin help reduce the buildup of ketones? Is that why people dont just flat out die on no carb diets?

We both pondered on it  and he had some really interesting theories Could it that specific ratio of columns to rows have something to do with the golden ratio or common screen width or the human visual perception or even the grassy knoll? And we came to the conclusion that  we couldnt find the right operator to get this some operator  .or this. some operator   or any other permutation. With a normalish display ratio of x or a resolution of x or x  none of these ratios get you to the ratio of columns to rows. Ill explain  normal division of these numbers   or  give you a ratio of . . and . respectively  whereas   . So screen ratio doesnt really make sense here. Visual perception  that we werent sure of. If anyone has a clue on how perception and these limits might coincide with each other Im open to any sort of explanation. The only thing I could think of was since light is sort of allmighty in terms of thats how we see things and the speed of light at  kms  well we couldnt make that fit either. Unless... does anyone know how fast light travels in different parts of the eye say the vitreous humor...? The only conclusion we could come to was it totally was the grassy knoll. May have also been the Umbrella Man. Bonus maybe the Excel creators used pi as a reference? We werent sure how.

It doesnt take into account the people with no living relatives and no kids. It doesnt take kids into account either. Also it gets really complicated if we take lineage into account... Yeah lets just leave the number at . billion. At least the gender ratio within this amount of people is fairly even  But definitely very interesting to think about how would you actually get the number of applicable people for which you could simply divide them into even family sizes?

This is how a robot might actually do it assuming I didnt make any errors its in javascript so you can run it in your web browserThe captcha requires an exact result an approximation wont do.I assumed digit  is the  because the question doesnt ask for decimal digits of Pi. I chose not to use arrays or recursion because while those things are pretty they are also slow. Code for doing this would not do something so inefficient. Also unless you are calculating pi on the spot and using it immediately or manipulating memory directly not possible in simple javascript you can NOT use a numeric type to hold pi up to the length necessary for answering the question.oddPositionDigitsOfPiTo Yields oddDigitsOfPiToPosition Yields ,theydidthemath,dbtx6n2,13,t5_2x23b

10878892,0,t3_5vakzs,Depends on when you ask.Im going to assume a  round revolver to avoid some typing but this is equally valid for  rounds. This first segment assumes no spinning of the cylinder between shots.. If you ask before anyone has shot the gun everyone has an equal probability of dying  each. After the first shot given the first person lives players  and  both have a  shot of dying player  has  chance of dying. After the second shot given the second person lives player  has  chance of dying players  and  have a  chance of dyingIf you spin between each shot it is more interesting. Im going back to a  round revolver as Im not typing out all the possibilities.Each trigger pull there is a  chance of getting the bullet. This means there is a  chance of being safe. For the bullet not to be fired after n trigger pulls there is a n chance.In order for the nth player to die everyone before them must be safe and they have to get the bullet. Multiplying those odds together you get n.This means if you are the nth player you have the following odds of dyingPlayer  | Likelihood of Death| | . | . | . | . | . | .If you end the game after everyone gets a turn only once there is a . chance that everyone lives.Everything I just said for the spinning case only applies before anyone shoots. After the first person shoots it is obvious that the second person has a  chance of dying. This means his odds of death have went up spoiler so have everybody elses! You can see the updated table below after one shot.Player  | Likelihood of Death| |  | . | . | . | . | .The likelihood of everybody surviving one round however has gone up to .. You can repeat this process after each consecutive shot.If you keep going in a circle it gets worse for the first guy. He basically gets the odds of the st th th th etc. player combined. The circle of death odds for each player arePlayer  | Likelihood of Death| | . | . | . | . | . | .A more fair way to do it would be to go  etc. The odds in this case would bePlayer  | Likelihood of Death| | . | . | . | . | . | .I feel like you should be able to come up with a sequence that gives even odds to all players but this is asserted without evidence.,theydidthemath,de22wio,3,t5_2x23b

11173852,0,t3_5za3vo,You can convert mechanical energy directly into thermal energy but that is hard to calculate unless you know how much of it you are converting. For your specific example with shaking a half full water bottle Im not sure the best way to approach that since only a small amount of the mechanical energy is going into friction in the water bottle. It does seem like a good assumption to me that a half full bottle will have more viscous sheer stresses than a full one. I wouldnt expect a full water bottle to heat very much at all.The problem with this scenario is that most of the mechanical energy in the water is turing to heat in your arm as you slow it down. If it was all going into the water temperature the water would stop itself. But we could probably design a experiment similar to Joules where shaking energy is mostly converted to heat in the botttle.Im imagining a long bottle with a series of perforated plungers inside connected to a rod that protrudes from both ends of the bottle and is connect to walls at both end so the bottle is suspended horizontally. The bottle is completely full and looks something like this||Forgive my meager illustrating skill. The idea is that you would apply a force over some distance in one direction and then allow the friction of the water through the plunger to stop the bottle completely and then repeat in the opposite direction. This allows you to convert work into heat. Alternatively the rod might not be attached to the walls and the bottle could rest on some kind of rail with minimal friction between the walls. You would accelerate the bottle to a specific speed toward one wall allow the plungerwater friction to stop the bottle after the rod contacts the wall and then repeat in the opposite direction. This allows you to convert kinetic energy into heat. In this scenario you could calculate number of shakes in a similar fashion to the way uYackabo calculates it.,theydidthemath,deyjl35,2,t5_2x23b

With .m employees at  locations this is about  employees per location If an average location has a revenue of .m and a profit of .m ill assume this instead of m because this is closer to the  profit margin you said this means they have a cost of .m per year An average US worker works for  hours in a year so  employees working  hours a year for . would cost the location . . increase in the hourly wage would cost an extra . well round it up to k If this cost were to be entirely passed on to the customers that same location would need a total revenue of .m or a . average increase in prices.With that said in reality the prices would probably not change a lot. This is because McDonalds is probably pricing their products in a rational way which mean the prices are set in a way to maximize profit that is if they go any higher the demand wouldnt accommodate the prices properly and theyd end up making less money.

11632166,0,t3_65nbuw,There have been approximately  million abortions since legalization in the U.S. At the extreme low end we could conclude that there would be no difference because people replaced the missing population with children later roughly the argument that BDSerotonin makes. At the extreme high end we could conclude that all of those children would have been additional to the current population furthermore we could conclude that about half of them would have reached childbearing age and had the average . children. That would put the additional population at roughly  million relatively few grandchildren would have been born at this point. I think neither number is entirely realistic. Looking at a study of groups of women who obtained abortions and who were turned away due to clinic cut off etc the turned away group had about a  live birth rate. It isnt a perfect estimate but it suggests that a decent ballpark estimate is that  of women denied an abortion would fail to subsequently obtain one. Using that estimate puts the number at around  million additional people in the U.S. the death toll due to unsafe abortions is about  in  not enough to seriously impact what are already fairly loose estimates. My best ballpark estimate is  million additional people which would put the population at around  million people. Obviously there are some pretty big limitations to that estimate. On the one hand its estimated from the proportion of women who wanted an abortion and failed to obtain an abortion in a country where it was already legal. In a country where it was illegal we might expect the failure to obtain an abortion to be higher making the total population higher as well. On the other hand these were women seeking an abortion fairly late in their pregnancy and they may have been less motivated than other women which might make their failure to obtain an abortion rate higher this in turn would result in a lower estimate of the additional population. My estimate also doesnt take into account children who were planned later who would have been displaced due to an aborted child not being aborted lowering the estimate. However without getting into the fungibility of children I think  million is probably a decent nonzero estimate.,theydidthemath,dgeiod2,1,t5_2x23b
