425920,0,t3_1yy4dd,Yes great success!!  Its all about line of sight and most HD towers are on Lookout Mountain just west of Golden School of Mines.  However there are also some repeater antennas in Fort Collins and Greeley.  I get some  channels most in high def though I live just east of the city limits.  Granted   are christian indoctrination think South Carolina and another  are Spanish great soccer coverage. Try AntennaWeb.com  Apply your address it will calculate your lineofsight using digital elevation models and list channels available to you and strength of broadcast.  If you have an indoor directional HD antenna it will tell you the azimuth you should point  typically  degrees give or take  degrees.  I roof mounted my  Radio Shack antenna with a low voltage amplifier.  That combined with a Roku and were practically grid free except for electricity water and INTERNET   .  Fuck NBCComcast!!!  Caveat  If you live in the foothills youre may be outofluck but then again mountain living has ALWAYS had its drawbacks and unbelievable perks.  Cant have it all though keeping in mind its all about lineofsight a small tower may help your antenna see over the next ridge with a clear lineofsight to Lookout Mountain.The only thing Ive really missed since cutting cable was NBCSNs Olympic hockey coverage but what I really wanted to watch I streamed via broadband w a proxy though not always high def. Our only subscription service is Netflix Century Link doesnt throttle like Comcast though I understand thats been resolved through Comcast extortion.  HULU sucks dont waste your money.  Did I mention I save kyr?Cant wait for Google Fiber.  Tired of Comcast and Century Links antiquated service and NBCComcasts bullshit.  FTR CBC had WAY better Olympic hockey coverage than NBC anyway and it didnt cost a dime extra.Actually looking forward to a SOPATPPlike challenge that TRIES to implement a fee for airwaves andor water and oxygen and watch what happens to the first congressadministration that tries to implement an American firewall.

1942355,0,t1_ckn3bol,I dont think its about there being a right to live anywhere in particular. But if you artificially limit growth as a policy youre going to drive prices higher than they would have been otherwise. There are at least two such policies in Boulder the biggest of which are open space and densityheight limits. If you make current open space available for development which nobody seems to be seriously proposing the city will grow outthough well be a long way from sprawl. If you reduce density limits the city will grow more citylikethough well be a long way from Denver much less NY or SF. But either one done intelligently should help relieve some of the price pressure in the city.Neither of these will make Boulder an inexpensive place to live. Boulder is expensive in part because theres a lot of economic activity here. And even if the average cost of rentreal estate were to go down there would still be more and less expensive neighborhoods and not everyone could afford to live everywheresome will even still be priced out entirely. But if you think its a bad thing that housing is so expensive here that its only available to a tiny sliver of the population who work or would otherwise be interested in living here its important to understand that we got into this situation because of our prior policy decisions and we shouldnt give the status quo any particular privilege just because its what happens if we cant decide to do something else.,boulder,ckn948o,5,t5_2qyl3

Maybe they are made with a lean cut of meat but they are a bit dry though not overcooked or tough and dont have a good meaty flavor. They dont melt in your mouth. Maybe its grassfed? I think all buffalo is primarily grass fed.I used to get buffalo burgers on a regular basis at a place called Terminal Brewhouse in Chattanooga and those were great. The trick is that they marinated the buffalo meat in something to make the patties juicy flavorful and tender. The marinade added just a slight flavor of its own I could never figure out what it was but mostly it brought out the flavor of the meat. The best beef burgers Ive had melt in your mouth and grease runs down your arm while you eat it. Theres nothing but beef added and no need to marinate. I think the key is to incorporate a lot of fat in the meat. Ive never had buffalo like that since it tends to be a leaner meat. Definitely dont order a buffalo burger cooked any more than medium.Ill have to try burgers at some of the other places suggested in this thread.,boulder,cls7kcz,1,t5_2qyl3

Then he moved to Boulder.My coworkers was a vegetarian and I started to order the same dishes. I noticed that I no longer need more.When the Research Institute and the Gallup Healthways company released a survey in the spring of the US lihavimmista and laihimmista cities the least overweight was found in Boulder. Hundred thousand inhabitants a university town located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains  miles northwest of Denver.Boulder attention is drawn to the fact that cyclists and bike lanes is a lot.

Boulder is located on the main campus of the University of Denver and the per capita income of about       per year.Overweight cities in the United States in turn are the northern industrial decline communities or the poor southern towns.

If Im going to find a new overweight it does not work he says.Dundon says that there should be no selfinterest in overweight women. On the other hand the models are of him far too long and thin a woman may be muscular or a little pyrekin. A bit like Goldilocks not too fat not too thin but just right Dundon says.What then is just right?Chautauquan in the park for lunch in the high school girls the ideal has changed.

By doing so you should be able to save  on apartment prices and if you calculate your yearly gas it wont be that much and you will be actually gaining profit.I would most likely look at the websites online and search each one individually and look at the lease sample.Theres a lot of helpful websites to give you that info all you have to do is establish a radius.I would probably suggest RockVue Apartments based on the rating given to it which is . with  people rating it.There is also AMLI Arista and retreat at Flat Iron.You have so many good choices to go through.Can you give us more details? What is your price range?  How many rooms are you looking for? What other thing are you looking from? I suggest you check out RockVue Apartments it just looks so amazing!!!!!!Updating this soon with a list of factors you should include with your research . If the apartment allows Dogs ? Cats? OR if you have any pets at all? . Swimming pool? Not sure if you like swimming? . Parking type underground vs above? . Cost per month? . Deposit cost? . Gym on site? .  bedroom?  bedroom? optical size?  ftsq? . Laundry and Dryer in unit ? or on site?So many factors but find one that you would like based onyour choice. ,boulder,cpxzhu5,7,t5_2qyl3

The same evaluation criteria and the same technical equipment were used and the results of the two investigations were compared.gt RESULTNo adverse longterm consequences were observed in six of the seven active runners regardless of preexisting damage at the baseline investigation. In one case the arthrotic changes were progressive in nature. The person who had given up running presented with severe deterioration of the internal structures of the knee joint.gt CONCLUSIONNonphysiological maximal loads secondary to the marathon race do not cause any permanent damage in the internal structures of the knee joint in individuals without significant preexisting damage. A disposition for premature arthrosis was not registered in the population investigated. A protective value of long distance running on the internal structures of the knee joint is discussed.,boulder,cvevjwu,1,t5_2qyl3
5225104,0,t1_cvfqhap,Thats all relative. From his perspective it was an unusual situation to which he responded unusually. I dont want to hear even the slightest bit of blame towards him regarding his nudity because she was guilty of nudity first. He responded in kind. And stalking isnt even close to the right word. Had it been stalking he wouldnt have just stopped due to a negative response to his advances. But he did. The hiding behind the rock bit suggests to me that he honestly thought her nudity was a sort of invitation but was afraid other people might also see him nude which he didnt want. People from Boulder are so pretentious. Its not black and white just because you feel so progressive about your feminism.  There are shades of grey everywhere especially in weird situations like this one and you should think accordingly. ,boulder,cvfte8e,1,t5_2qyl3

5318461,0,t1_cvq218o,The numbers change but all studies show that biking on the sidewalk is significantly more dangerous than on a street. Its primarily because of the decreased visibility drivers have. People coming out of driveways turning into driveways and turning onto side streets all have a much harder time seeing you. In addition sidewalks are usually designed for pedestrian traffic and as such often have sudden turns and obstacles. These make bikers move more unpredictably making them harder to avoid.

Basically they distance themselves from any affiliations so they dont have to adhere to any set doctrine as passed down from the general assembly and can say whatever they want basically as long as ...Jesus loves you are the last words. I have been an atheist a couple of years now but attended church while living in Dallas. These type of churches are basically all the same. Feel good surface level messages about how Jesus wants you to be happy and then a very well marketed image that adheres to a kind of urban outfitters aesthetic.  The worship sets look like U concerts. Free coffee free doughnuts free hugs who doesnt say yes? These things are kind of modern wonders tbh.

8280334,0,t1_d5ck3lh,Sorry about that. Originally this post was removed. I dont know why I think it might be because posts from new accounts are removed. I spent awhile seeing if it was gone and I thought it was so I posted it on the thread hoping for a few responses there but when I came back it was up here. Not meaning to post twice. Whether Ill include peoples biographies depends on their consent or not. Some people Ill never get their full story and may just be able to tell what I know. Id like to get more complete stories for a few individuals and Ive volunteered in places with some individuals who have been veterans and heard some stories which have been absolutely heartbreaking.One thing I will point out is that some of the individuals you believe are embracing the transient lifestyle are actually individuals who have been kicked out of their parents home who its true take up what looks like a nomadic lifestyle get into drugs and embrace counterculture. This is not a lifestyle choice. These are coping mechanisms for rejection from larger society. Ive spoken to a few of them. Its hard and takes a really long time and a lot of conversations to get at the truth. Sometimes PTSD is a part of it quite a large number are LGBTQ. Again I refer you back to the just world hypothesis  Once youve lived out on the street for a long time for any reason it becomes hard to fit back into society. Whether its an army vet or a kid who was rejected from a family due to abuse or due to sexual orientation blaming an individual for their own situation and for their coping mechanisms is pretty harsh. I think that calling people bums because you disapprove of how they look or how they smell or the fact that they have trash around them just serves to dehumanize them and reinforces the stereotype. ,boulder,d5clmz2,3,t5_2qyl3

Youve got great points on things that need changing and you can get more upvotes by having that nuance that the crosswalks are popular. You dont have to be a civil engineer to not sound like an ass.gt I think its bizarre that a town would actively encourage a stunted flow of traffic as well as the need to stop short arbitrarily while creating a false sense of security for pedestrians who think drivers can magically stop as soon as a light with no warning or delay starts blinking.Im sorry but that makes no sense. Vehicles only slow down or stop for at maximum twenty seconds. That is not substantial enough to stunt traffic.And false sense of security? The cars may not stop aspect of the flashing crosswalks is to allow cars to drive on through once the pedestrian has left the lane unlike a stop light. The concept is a compromise between drivers who dont have to wait for a green light and pedestrians who dont have to walk to an intersection. It improves efficiency requiring both drivers and pedestrians to exercise caution.,boulder,d9ns0ml,1,t5_2qyl3

If the job is close to Union Station and youre walkable to a Flatiron Flyer stop ie downtown Boulder or south of there along Broadway or Table Mesa then its really easy. Bus is frequent enough that you dont even really need to look at the timetable. Just show up at the stop and youll never wait long.The traffic is worse in the opposite direction lots of backup getting into Boulder in the morning and leaving Boulder in the afternoon.All that said my situation was a temporary circumstance and Im not sure I would ever intentionally choose to live  minutes from my job.In Denver you get good views of the mountains in the distance.
