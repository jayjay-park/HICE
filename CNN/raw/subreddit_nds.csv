6482951,0,t3_44bhdk,I havent played a lot of the games on that list. Theres a lot of DS games I still have to try even though I got my DS Lite in  or maybe  I dont remember but Im working on it! I do have to say I never owned a flashcart so I couldnt play every game I wanted too. I was against the idea of piracy even back then when I was a kid and I still am.Some of my most memorable games include Pokmon SoulSilver. My first Pokmon game ever and man what a great experience! I just started another playthrough on it. Man the memories of traveling through Jotho battling my friends using our Pokwalkers on the playground so great. Pokmon White . In my opinion the best Pokmon game Ive ever played. The region is great the Pokmon and characters are cool and memorable the aftergame is amazing and the story was great too!  Mario Kart DS. Nothing beats a good Mario Kart race with your friends. This distinction could also go to Mario Party DS and it definitely has a shot at taking the cake for most fun multiplayer but Mario Kart DS is more memorable in my opinion. That may also be because I owned Mario Party  before Mario Party DS and we played that one more often. With Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii Mario Kart DS was first Viva Piata Pocket Paradise. This one may come as a surprise but this game was surprisingly addictive. The basic idea is that you have to run a garden where different Piata can come to live. The basic premise is simple but its actually very relaxing and a lot of fun. I felt more driven to find every Piata than I felt to complete the Pokdex! Super Scribblenauts. This game is amazing. I already thought the original Scribblenauts was great but this one absolutely blew me away. The possibilities are literally endless! I have played this game over  hours and I still havent found every word! It can be very addicting and its very unique. Its one of those games where you can screw around on the title screen for an hour and not get bored. Definitely worth checking out.These following games arent the ones I immediately think of when I think of my time with the DS but they still come to mind occasionally and then immediately remind me of why I loved my DS so much so I feel like theyre worth a mention. Kirby Super Star Ultra. Ill be honest when I think of great DS games this one doesnt immediately jump to mind. However once I remember it I definitely remember what an awesome game it is. Easily my favourite Kirby game period. Yes I know its just a remake of the SNES title but its just so much fun to play! Mario amp Luigi Bowsers Inside Story. This was one of my first experiences with the RPG genre outside of Pokmon and it was amazing. The story was fun the gameplay was great it had that perfect mix of challenging but not too frustrating. I should come back to this one its absolutely a gem. Plants vs. Zombies. I already owned the game both on PC and on the DSiWare but I loved it so much and I wanted to experience the multiplayer! So I asked it for Christmas and I dont regret it. Ive killed so many boring busrides just playing this against a friend of mine. If you never played a Plants vs Zombies game and you happen to come across this one its definitely worth checking out. The PC version does look and control better but I just love the multiplayer on the DS! Nintendogs. I had dogs but to be able to take care of them all by myself I dont know it just had a certain charm. To take care of my own little puppies and to take them on walks and play with them and to play with the puppies of my friends it was just plain fun! And that feeling when you FINALLY earn enough money for that huge appartement you want you know the feeling I mean. I should probably go play it again though Glamar and Laila probably starved to death by now. Pokmon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky. The first game to almost make me cry. I wont spoil the ending but this game is just like MampL BIS the perfect bland of challenging but not too frustrating. I loved the story I loved the gameplay and I loved the Pokmon. In fact I still do. Definitely worth checking out.Some honorable mentions from my little brother New Super Mario Bros.. He mainly remembers this as the first game that gave him that feeling of I almost beat it! On to the final boss! ADRENALYN!!!! I do remember us playing the multiplayer and both laughing and yelling at eachother at the same time. It was fun but it cant beat Mario Kart. Crazy Pig. A weird in my opinion very lame where you play a few little minigames with a cute pig. It wasnt anything special at all and I found it to be very shallow but he really liked it. Who knows all just a matter of opinion I guess. Mario amp Luigi Bowsers Inside Story. Same reasoning as me.And this is just a handful. There are so many other great andor memorable titles out there. Mario amp Sonic at the Olympic Games Mario amp Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games Drawn to Life English Training TouchMaster my first DS game ever Kirby Mass Attack the first game I ever preordered Super Princess Peach WarioWare D.I.Y. the list just goes on and on. The DS was my first gaming system ever along with the Wii and I have so many fond memories of it. Even though my DS has largely replaced them by now Ill always have a special place in my heart for my DS Lite and my DSi.And just for fun here are some of my dishonorable mentions Petz My Monkey Family. It was on sale for  and I can see why. This game is boring repetitive and has very little to offer. I will admit that breeding different monkeys is cute if not a little disturbing but other than that it has very little to offer especially compared to Nintendogs. Max amp The Magic Marker. This game is tedious boring and I stopped playing after five minutes. I have a personal grudge against it though mainly because this was the first game I blew a ton of money on that I actually regretted.  the biggest waste of money I ever made at that point. Such a dissapointment especially after a suprisingly promising WiiWare demo ,nds,czpvvw1,3,t5_2qoyv
