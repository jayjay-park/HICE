7828751,0,t1_d3vozep,Thanks.  It looks like they only have those for very small pieces.,LegoStorage,d3w0oa5,2,t5_2wjy2
9288799,0,t1_d8t97z4,Depends on what you want to do with the pieces. If Im taking apart a set Im probably not going to build it again and I am going to use the pieces for my MOCs. Some people leave them sorted by sets because they plan on rebuilding the set some day or may resell the set. Ask yourself what you plan on doing with Lego. Are you going to just do official sets? Then maybe sorting by set is perfect for you. Also consider what you might be doing  years from now. If you plan on doing MOC modular buildings or cars you might want to start sorting by piece and maybe even color now before your collection gets too large. If you plan on doing MOC mosaics then you might want to sort by color and maybe piece style. Have you looked into buying from Bricklink? Its a site that offers new and used Lego from independent sellers and there are Brazilian sellers on Bricklink. You can buy all sorts of new and used Lego stuff on Bricklink. Just be wary. Read reviews regarding stores. Make sure you understand their shipping policies and any fees that they have. I get quite a lot of my stuff from Bricklink. ,LegoStorage,d8tf778,2,t5_2wjy2
