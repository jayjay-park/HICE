779451,0,t1_cgstlf0,Well if youre interested in maths and Racket then you probably dont have the option of completely avoiding Typed Rkt  Some of the math pkgs in Racket e.g. number theory are writen in it and even though that doesnt bring any special requirements for your code you will still be haunted by the existence of Typed Racket in your dreams... ,Racket,cgsvln6,1,t5_2rjn1

3163237,0,t3_2wd9e2,Whats happening here is due to a confusion over how and works.When called it returns either f or if no argument is f it returns the last of its arguments.    and curry positive? curry exact?thus evaluates to the last of its arguments since both arguments are functions which are not f    curry exact?Reducing this    filter and curry positive? curry exact?  is the same as    filter exact?  In the same fashion    filter and curry exact? curry positive?  is the same as    filter positive?  What you intend to do is rather    filter lambda n and positive? n exact? n  or using a function to do this in a shorter form    filter andc positive? exact?  ,Racket,copv9gl,2,t5_2rjn1

7467931,1,t1_d2r1sxv,gt Realm of Racket is an introduction to Racket and programmingAnd it fails miserably at being that as well. If examples are incomplete and dont compile what chance has a programming novice got?gt not a reference for how to use Racket.Err yes thats exactly what it is. I wasnt looking for something it didnt claim to cover basic GUI and clientserver programming.The problem is it doesnt.gt Perhaps youd be happier with the Racket documentation.Compared to RoR definitely.,Racket,d2r239o,0,t5_2rjn1

11366699,0,t1_dfi1i45,I can only guess Far is not aware of Swindle the Racket CLOSlike object system. The racketclass object system is the familiar Javalike object system but classes are a firstclass value. It also has mixins traits and class contracts.Racket also has ProtoObj  a prototype object system like JavaScript or Self. On a related theme the macro system including syntaxparse and the facilities for creating DSLsand languages support creating your own macro system  all three mentioned above are written in Racket.
