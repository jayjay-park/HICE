55946,0,t1_cekqnxm,You are trying on a very small lock which can make it more difficult as well.  Id recommend finding an elcheapo Master lock at a local hardware store probably ish or something similar for free if you can get it elsewhere.You definitely should start on a lock big enough to feel each pin individually.  You could also look at training locks on ebay or the like where you can start with a lock with only  or  pins to help build a feel for the keyway.All of the practise is about feeling how the insides of a lock should move normally and as being picked.Also if youre using an old lock or one thats been out in the weather hit that sucker with graphite or WD to loosen it up.  Picking an old lock thats sticky is making it even harder.Take your time too  if you feel yourself getting frustrated take a break and come back to it.  Its really helped me stay the course on really tough locks a particularly tough security one took me  days of on and off tinkering over xmas.,lockpicking,cekssfh,1,t5_2qh7k
90011,0,t3_1v3nlb,Its still breaking and entering. Youll get an additional charge for possession of burglary tools with intent to use them in most states. They can determine if the lock was picked if material from the lock is on your picks if the pick marks are recent but its probably not necessary considering youve already placed yourself at the scene of the crime without permission and with burglary tools in your pocket.For all those with an interest or questions on how a lock can be examined to determine if it was picked I might know a little about the subject if you have questions  ,lockpicking,ceood8z,6,t5_2qh7k

If you cant make it work at the bottom of the keyway move your wrench to the top. I like the TW and TW  style wrenches for auto picking. I also use a small flat screwdriver for a tension wrench with some carss Ford Taurus because the face plate with the shutter are inset so deep in the door handle my wrenches dont reach effectively. The RL style tends to break often I bought about  of those in  years. Theyre a good addition to my kit I like them but they just dont last long. Ive only ever broken  of the TW wrenches.

652752,0,t3_21ksi2,   Well in my experience these locks can range from incredibly easy to sort of hard. Ive only run into the more difficult handles at schools and government facilities. I have however found very easy handles on most portables classrooms in my area. Now all that said a co worker of mine asked me if it would be easy to get into the managers office she was the manager so I put tension on it stuck my half ball in there and before I could start picking the door was open. My suggestion is to use a half ball and always be sure to practice your tension. To me tension is the key to success.    As a side note why is everyone so up the ass about whether he owns the lock or not? Some of the people in this subreddit are scumbags myself included and just love to pick anything thats locked. Yes sometimes its illegal and high profile and in some cases land you in jail. I know theres a secret sect of white knights that uphold the law and respect the tools and bla bla.

6144897,0,t3_3zp3w5,Lol you did the exact same thing as me! I got my lock the same exact lock a few days ago.ampnbspPractice locks are an excellent way to get into lockpicking. However there are some problems particularly with the ones sold en masse on Amazon which you can find exact copies of on dhgatealiexpress are horrible.  st one pet peeve is that the one we have shows  pins but only  move.  nd just like you I have never picked a lock before in my life or even tried to. The only tools I had was a pc super basic set that were half the length of regular picks with no handles. Granted it had a good selection gem LRake worm rake  hooks and a tension wrench. the keys were attached to the locked lock shackle. I decided that instead of just pulling a key off Id try to unlock it. I put the tension wrench in put on tension put the hook to the back to the lock to just feel all the pins pulled it out and then the lock unlocked. It was just that easy. I unlocked it for my first time with really bad tools faster than I could have taken the key off the ring. Basically every time I put a pick all the way in and pulled it out it unlocked. Maybe  in  took  tries or maybe overset something. The only experience I have comes from watching Bosnianbills videos. rd they have really bad tolerances because theyre really low budget and arent trying to prevent you from opening. Quite the opposite actually. So making them easy to open might seem like somewhat of an incentive for someone selling a practice lock. Locks that are sold for the purpose of keeping you out are ultimately what you want to practice on. th and the most important one IMO is that you cant repin this lock as far as I can tell. Without partially destroying it. I might start drilling into it soon to try.ampnbspAfter going through this disappointment I decided to find a good practice lock. I decided on a few criteria. No Transparent Locks  since theyre only sold to be opened for practice so they probably have poor tolerances. The only one I might consider is Southords acrylic practice lock. It had to be one designed for locking something up but converted to a practice lock. . Must be a standardcommon amp reliable cylinder manufacturer  For same reason as  it had to have been born as a real lock that youre likely to encounter fairly often and converted to a practice lock so that I know the intention is to keep people out and that the tolerances arent really poor.. Must be repinnable  I can change the pins once Ive mastered it so that I can use it for practice forever regardless how good I get.ampnbspThere are a few good options for this particularly two. Practice Cylinders  These arent cutaway so you wont be able to look to see the pins in action. But these are set up to be repinned with nothing but a hex wrench and a screw. This Practice Lock is a fantastic example of this. Although this website is a tad overpriced.. Cutaway Cylinders  These are the same except theyre the smaller cores so you can much more easily make a cutaway version. The only downside really afaik is that you can see the pins. you can just cover the cutaway part so that you cant see them move if possible. This Practice Lock is the one I bought. I put in the first and only bid for  minutes before it ends and he seems to continually run a bid for them. I see it as a buyitnow for about  I believe.ampnbspIn addition to repin them you need more pins. If you order a kit like this one the lock comes with a set of pins to play around with to repin the locks. Alternatively This  set is a relatively cheap addition and gives you quite a bit more pins. These will probably keep you busy for months or even years if you play around with all the possible combinations. Ultimately I went a step further and bought bulk security pins from clksupplies They sell all sizes of pins. A set of  top and bottom pins cost . each so . for  total pins half bottom half top of one size. I got  different sizes plus a  set of  springs. That was just under . You can use fewer sizes of top pins or even just one size and only buy  sets of  top pins but that is less secure not a big deal for beginners practicing though especially since most locks use the same size top pins afaik. Thatd be . for  sizes of bottom pins and just  sets of top pins. The problem is there are no high security pins but its not too hard to make them yourself. Plus making them you can make a much larger variety than just spools and serrated which are what come in those sets. This video by Bosnianbill teaches you how to make your own security pins with a dremel and needle files.ampnbspSo with all that you can make a practice lock that can provide valuable practice indefinitely.ampnbspThe main disadvantage to using just  practice lock is that you dont get to test your abilities on a wide variety of different cylindersmanufacturers which have their own little quirks as well as bypasses. The main benefit of using  practice lock is to save money. The best way to overcome the lack of variety disadvantage by using only  lock while still trying to save as much money as possible is to find the cheapest way to acquire bulk locks. As you can see from my recent lock haul post I made out like a bandit buying  different locks for . Buying from alternative sources such as ReStore by Habitat for Humanity junkyardsscrapyardsmetal recyclers and locksmiths throwing out their trash is a great way to get a variety of locks very cheap. However the problem is still that some locks are more common than others. so finding a high security lock from alternative sources will require some luck. This is because theyre less common because people usually recognize their value and dont leave them behind or scrap them and because theyre made to last. High quality metals for physical security last a long time and can take a beating before someone might consider trashingabandoning them. Even still if you manage to get locks for . each like me you might find someone in the lock sport community with a nice high security lock that they dont need or have another of who will trade for a larger quantity of less valuable locks that you get from these sources. You could even repin the locks youre trading with pins purchased for your practice lock especially if you bought a large quantity of pins like I did and are making your own. Then it could be considered a challenge lock and give them a challenge.,lockpicking,cyo3z5m,21,t5_2qh7k

6612691,0,t1_d037bfv,honestly the kit was definitely more expensive but completely worth it there is absolutely no comparison. when I first got the cheapo pick set off of amazon I had to spend about  minutes grinding off all of the rough edges just so I could use it otherwise it would get caught in the keyway making simple locks difficult to pick and the clear lock that came with it was garbage. also Im very gentle with picking yet after only a few weeks with the amazon kit I managed to bend a few of the picks and the tension wrenches that came with it were also pretty useless. now for the sparrows kit it came with a nylon zipper case and seems very well made all of the picks that came with it were very smooth and well made id say they were almost polished the steel they used is slightly thicker but still fits in all of the keyways I have tried them on also the steel itself is definitely much stronger and not as willing to bend and as for the tension wrenches it came with I ve been using the top of the keyway pry bars and have fallen in love with them I will say though they arent as good as the Peterson pry bars theyre a little bit thinner so they dont take up as much of the keyway as id like them to so they fall out pretty easily if youre not careful there is also a huge selection of  tension wrenches though so if youre working on a lock with a weird or narrow keyway theres something in this kit that will fit. also as far as the rakes I love the triple peak rake that comes with this kit works very well on all of the locks ive played with since getting it. so all in all definitely love this sparrows kit and theres no comparison to the cheap amazon kits. also like to point out the price for this one was  Canadian or about USD so a little pricey but definitely worth it,lockpicking,d03b3vd,2,t5_2qh7k

Now if you can do that with the clockwise turn starting on the right side instead youd have a better chance in a real world situation. humm I wonder how one would pick a lock in a space thats designed so you have to reach up to the lock with a solid enclosure on the sides and top? Set low enough most people have to crouch or lean awkwardly before then reaching up? Of course I dont think you could have gotten this lock on there it was a masterlock or something. Unlocking wasnt to bad mostly just using yoru fingers to feel the spot before you inserted the key but to lock it you had to lean in to the door so the latching mechanism would move all the way allowing a swinging arm to line up with the stationary piece then reach inup with the hand holding the lock use your thumb to push the swinging arm up into position and hook the latch through the lined up holes with out letting go of the swinging arm. Once that was done closing the lock wasnt a problem but you had to do the whole latching motion one handed.,lockpicking,d0crk75,-9,t5_2qh7k

Verizon Sprint and ATampT all have antennas on the tower and equipment inside the head end.  Its easier for each company to have their own lock and key for access since perhaps they have the locks keyed alike depending on region.  If a single lock were there the key given to each company may easily be misplaced or with a different engineer when it must be accessed.

8840451,0,t1_d7aesti,Interesting. I would really need some sort of caliper to measure them which I do not currently have. Unless you want me to use a banana for scale . I do however have a crap ton of bristles I could fold up and send your way if you pm me your address. I also have a ton of wiper inserts as the guys at autozone save them for me. There are actually two different companies in the U.S. that make the street sweeper bristles. The one that Rai uses the most are from b bristle and brush out of lubbuck Texas. They are slightly flatter although almost the same to the untrained eye. The other ones that I send him are from the company that is right near my house its called az sweeper something or other. They both use a process of injecting straight wire into a machine where a series of rollers flatten it where it is then cut to size. I actually saw the whole manufacturing process on the bristles and it was quite interesting. let me know if you want some. ,lockpicking,d7ahwc8,1,t5_2qh7k

Eventually youll wear it so much that you can no longer see the pins andor cause the pins to jam up due to debris. They are also made cheaply. The very cheap ones may fall apart after only a few uses. Also for that price of used you can get all of them new from bang good.

Suffice to say that nobody would invest that much time effort and energy into a tool that would only open a single lock. You are correct that this lock is not Protec or Protec. This is however the predecessor to the Protec line and I have no doubt many of the same manipulation principles apply. It is standard practice to gut any lock that can be gutted however as Hux said in the beginning of his video that padlock is made in such a way that the core cannot be removed. In this case all he needs to do is demonstrate that the core cannot be removed to comply with standard practice. He did that.

Then take your hook and rake back to front to set most of them. When you have two or so left simply take your hook or flag pick in sideways and gently rotate it applying pressure to the pin.

The only way I can see this happening is if a key had been used like a rake and popped inout whilst applying tension. Still hard to envisage it turning though.The problem you have here is the keyretaining nib that is now fixed under the outer ledge. As you have the lock out of the door or whatever then you can fix it luckily. That round thing on top of the lock set back from the front If it is threaded then screw the appropriate little bolt in there and pull the cap out. If it is not threaded then youll have to use a little selftapping screw to grab onto it so you can pull it out. From there you can unload the lock from the rear and ultimately free the key.,lockpicking,devofbe,2,t5_2qh7k

If you break your lock and replace it yourself youre probably looking at around  for schlage and  for qwikset.  Youll also need it rekeyed to match any other locks at your house.  To get to the store to pick up your new lock youll either be leaving your house unlocked and possibly with the door open depending on how its broken or youll be locked out of your house and need to find other entry.Youll also be spending a good chunk of your day in chasing down a door lock and installing it.Its really not worth the time expense and hassle when its so extremely cheap to just buy the lock you want to pick.,lockpicking,dgf6gyq,1,t5_2qh7k

11684717,0,t3_66qh0e,I would say its a bad idea. Not sure about the legality of it but the process of picking a lock does have a known risk of breaking the lock. This is one reason why it is highly recommended NOT to pick lock in use.,lockpicking,dgkhah4,10,t5_2qh7k
11710592,0,t3_673eft,One of my locks has a pin that behaves similarly to what youre describing  can you tell if any other pin is binding besides this one? In my case i had to set another one further in the cylinder and come back to the stubborn one couldnt tell you why. ,lockpicking,dgnfbh9,1,t5_2qh7k

11786220,0,t1_dgvriuy,Man... I have around  into this hobby. I started it because it was a cheap hobby. Then I fell in love with it. Then I ended up buying a few things here and a few things there... Oh Sparrows has a sale? I better buy a bunch right now. Peterson has a sale? Im going to buy what ever I need. Peterson and Sparrow dont have a sale but I got paid and Im really drunk? Boom another  gone on a random day. Fuck. lol But once you find a hobby you know your going to stay with then its a hobby worth spending money on. Also paying  over several years really isnt that bad when you still have most of it. If you would have told me  years ago I wouldnt have believed you that Id have that much money into it. Worth it ,lockpicking,dgw09qp,4,t5_2qh7k
