334941,0,t3_1xx602,This is a pretty cool remix from Xinobi embracing that kind of Miami style of house music. The parts of this song that make it really interesting to me are his use of filters. He uses alot of lowpass filters to bring in instruments subtly rather than just giving them a hard intro. Also while his support synth is playing chords he isnt afraid to start creating stacks among the leads that form some really interesting chords with the bass and supports for just a fraction of a second.On top of all this he threw general formating out the window for electronic music and created a very true progressive format.,listentous,cffhjbz,3,t5_2sqe4

In Mr. Cohens own words Every succeeding moment changes what has happened the moment before ... all that is written changes its meanings by what is written subsequently. First We Take Manhattan might be understood as an examination of the mind of the extremist.CatchyTchKung  Bou Jeloud PostIndustrial Continuing with the subcurrent of revolutionary ruckus TchKung was a fairly radical band back in their day.  They infused quite a bit of tribal elements into their industrialpunkishpostindustrial milieu.  I cant help but start to groove to this track once it builds into its rhythm and it has the added bonus after  or so of song and another  of silence of including a stepbystep tutorial in three different languages on how to make a molotov cocktail.ObscureA Silver Mt. Zion  Built Then Burnt Hurrah! Hurrah! PostRock  Obscure is a relative term particularly within this subreddit I imagine but nonetheless I put forth this track.  The spoken word at the beginning is mixed super low and is almost inaudible without cranking the volume but it speaks to revolutionary hope and passion built and then lost and then proffers that hope once again albeit reframed towards the end.  You can feel that in the music  despair loss hope passion all at once...About MeWith current events as they are while thinking about the theme I couldnt shake the idea of revolution as fated as potentially ominous as this looming spectre and those thoughts set the backdrop for and ultimately guided my selections.

Its sorta just electronicaEDM track one after another except Im pretty sure Angus Andrews vocals and the way theyre cut up amp effected will always somehow manage to rip the Liars out of standard EDM or altrock  also theyll always have an interesting enough synth choice to set them apart too  honestly with what Ive seen them do to create sound a contact mic inside an orange or something  not even sure what sound they were getting I feel like the weird little gurgles throughout Mess possibly arent even synths  though I could easily be wrong.  The thing is I feel like Mess has way less comprehensible lyrics than WIXIW and is way more homogenous than it.With how much I appreciate and respect Liars approach to electronic percussion not just drums the little pulses and pops they put in at such cool intervals my two favorite songs from Mess are Cant Hear Well and Left Speaker Blown  totally drumless songs.

Its a series of cultural movements specially some from the late XIX century and the first half of the XX century dadaism futurism surrealism cubism constructivism serialism etc.. However the term is sometimes used to designate all innovative  groundbreaking art movements not necessarily from that time bracket and as a consequence a lot of innovative music gets called avantgarde. Im not saying its wrong but its hard to define exactly what is and what isnt avantgarde in the XXI century groundbreaking isnt an unequivocally identifiable quality.I think my idea of what avantgarde is differs from hornwalkers anyway so his response might be different.,listentous,chcf2mg,1,t5_2sqe4

3278429,0,t3_2xomb5,Current  are one of the three big names of British neofolk and are by far the nearest to mainstream consciousness. This is probably due to a variety of reasons not least of which must be considered the extent to which Death in June and Sol Invictus remain tainted by associations with farright politics. Though this is not something Current  escapes entirely the consistency of Dave Tibets visionary explorations of apocalypse mortality and damnation over the  years the band has been in operation carry a certain guarantee of authenticity it is difficult to claim that this is a man with some sort of hidden ulterior motive. A string of high profile collaborations has helped raise the bands profile particularly in later years recent albums have featured a diverse cast including Marc Almond Antony Hegarty Nick Cave Sasha Grey and Andrew WK ! it should be pointed out before there are too many thoughts of a novelty troupe that Nick Caves association with the band stretches back to s All The Pretty Little Horses Cave and Tibet doubtless finding some common ground in their interest in Christian esotericism and Dave Tibet released Antony and the Johnsons first album through his label Durtro.Coming  years into Current s unsettling musical journey Lucifer Over London came hot on the heels of the rather subdued at least musically Of Ruine Or Some Blazing Starre and though it starts gently enough the musical quotating of Black Sabbaths Paranoid aside this title track soon finds Dave Tibet reaching peaks of frantic intensity that hadnt been quite seen since s Earth Covers Earth. The combination of the hypnotic sounds of the guitar and backing vocals with Tibets nearbreakdown performance is classic Current  and this song is a defining work of the bands early s period seeming to have crept back into live sets increasingly over the last few years.,listentous,cp1ytzu,1,t5_2sqe4
