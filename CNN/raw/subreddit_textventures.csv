But this is ridiculous Suddenly I instinctively raise my hand grabbing a speck of dust that got way too close to my ear and made a sound similar to a fly or something. How... how the heck did I do that? I could see the speck of dust in incredible detail I could feel it in my hands as if it was a hundred times the size it actually was...And thats when the painful noises from outside came in. I could hear everything screams honks birds chirping footsteps even people talking normally. It was a mess of noises and I could swear I even heard some people talking in a foreign language really that was normal in New York but it still felt weird. I immediately rushed to close the window and had another surprise I took a fifth of a second to get to my window.

3774419,0,t1_cqmf1tw,I take out the vial of blood and with all my strength throw it at him. It shatters against his person and stains his shirt crimson. He smirks and advances his weapon drawn. I bend down grab the knife he threw at me and ready myself for an imminent attack. But he seems to be in no hurry apparently confident of besting me. He starts to circle me quite aware that a mindless attack would be foolish on the uneven and bumpy terrain. He could lose the advantage his weapon affords. I pick up a handful of rocks and throw them at him one by one in another effort at buying some time. He skillfully dodges the projectiles and taunts me uttering curses and threats all the while drawing near in an evertightening circle. He is almost upon me when suddenly out of the corner of my eye I spy a dark body crouching ready to leap. I see LaBouf has sensed its approach as well and turns to face this threat just in time to defend himself from this new entity.Its a wolf likely attracted to the scene by the scent of blood on LaBoufs shirt. The beast snarls and lunges forward bringing him down. He loses grip of the weapon and it clatters near my feet. I scramble to pick it up keeping my distance from the fighting pair. But LaBouf is not a feeble opponent and is parrying the wolfs fierce attacks commendably. I take this opportunity to move away and hide behind a large tree.,textventures,cqmife6,3,t5_2yax9
