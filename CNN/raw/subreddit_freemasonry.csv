244379,0,t3_1wnb34,The answer is pretty simple guys.I think about this often and I consider myself a feminist in many ways but here is the real reason of why Masonry is men only.The average man thinks about sex all the time and when women are present they then become in competition with each other to satisfy their sexual engineering.But when women are not present men are then NOT in competition. This creates the best possible environment to facilitate selfbuilding team building and clear expression of ideas. Now obviously women should never be obstructed to their place in the world which is to be on the same level as men. But men need times in their lives to divest themselves of their desires to truly perform the selfperfection that Masonry calls for. The ancient Masons knew this and built their lodges in this way.,freemasonry,cf62yt7,1,t5_2qn38

348463,0,t3_1y2v6p,Its a good start but I have some recommendations for you... Remove login form on the right hand side as only a small portion of visitors need it. Add a welcoming image to the homepage. Landing on a page that is strictly text isnt that welcoming. Maybe even use this as a space to show some upcoming events this will help new visitors to see how active your lodge is. If youre going to make a site responsive you should do so on all pages. For instance the officers page has a responsive navigation menu but everything else is not responsive. The breakpoints in the site just seem a little odd to me sometimes an image shrinks when it could easily shift over and get bigger. Maybe have an area that has photos of some of your events. Your Trestleboard  thinking down the road will it be easy to navigate to past months or will that info not be available?

I guess we kind of avoid this issue in Ohio by making masons do the proficiency in front of everyone then the mason and his coach leave the room and then everyone votes whether or not its accepted. Plus at our lodge we have enough masons going through the degrees that we usually have a proficiency every meeting which allows a mason to see another mason do a proficiency before he gives his.

I knew what I wanted out of my lodge but never got it. Indeed the search is on for a new home so to speak. Unfortunately those are far and few between. Many of the lodges in my area are an amalgamation of many who merged some waiting to die or merge again. I never really felt a connection with my lodge and felt like an outsider. I was the only one I knew of who petitioned without knowing anyone on the inside.What I am more focused on know is knowing the ritual forwards and backwards. I feel that once I have that I can go anywhere with the knowledge.What help is it to join a lodge with only  attendance and cant fill chairs? The obvious answer would be Because you could save it!.

695178,0,t3_223s2q,Im torn on this.  Theres not a lot of places that men can be...well to be brutally honest uncouth in their joking discussions of life.  Ive never met a Lodge where every member is a perfect gentlemen on the topic of women when no ladies are around.  I consider that a lot more polite than being that way halfdrunk in a bar with strangers.  Hell if nothing else the fact that we only promise not to cheat or have other unsavory relations with the close family of of Brethren is an example of aspects of the mindset that would have to change with women involved.The flipside of course... I think excluding women is antithetical to a lot of the concepts of Masonry.  Other than the male bias in a few small parts of Obligations there is nothing in the ritual or symbolism that would exclude women.  You could take our ritual carefully reword out the actual secrets and create an entire order of women stonecutters without bending over backwards or breaking any rules!Hell you could make of a mason a woman in  generations by just removing the line from the Obligation and waiting for this generation to die out.  Itd be slow in a fair way yet still move toward acceptance.But then thats another inclusive club thats gone.

I like it as hard working brethren with younger families can usually manage every single meeting whereas I know that if I had to attend every week I simply couldnt make more than about one in three. I would feel like I was less a part of it then the retired guys who had  attendance and would be there every night of the week if they could.

As an example I am the only Mason that was raised in my lodge in a  year period. Since then Ive pushed for us to build a solid web presence and communicate more via social media. Currently we have a number of new Master Masons all working in the lodge as well as a handful of EAs and more petitions and aspirants coming in each and every month. Ask them how they found us. Almost invariably the answer is I saw your website or My friend shared your Facebook post.General pages which cover Masonic topics are valuable but dont directly contribute as much in my eyes  in some cases the conversations are more divisive and some of the larger pages in my opinion do a disservice to those who may be interested in joining our fraternity.

1308532,0,t1_cigtqo1,ampampamp Historicity of Jesus sfw gtgtThe historicity of Jesus concerns the analysis of historical evidence to determine whether Jesus of Nazareth existed as a historical figure and whether any of the major milestones in his life as portrayed in the gospels can be confirmed as historical events.gtHistoricity is the study of the historical actuality of persons and events meaning the quality of being part of history as opposed to being a historical myth or legend or of being part of prehistory Questions of historicity arise where accounts of events are believed by some to be true but cannot be verified either due to the absence of historical records of sufficient reliability or where historical accounts incorporate folklore theological views or literature as fact.gtThe historicity of Jesus is distinct from the related study of the historical Jesus which refers to scholarly reconstructions of the life of Jesus based on historical methods including critical analysis of gospel texts as the primary source for his biography along with consideration of the historical and cultural context in which he lived.     These reconstructions accept that Jesus existed although scholars differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the parts of his life that have been recorded in the Gospels.         gtMost modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed    but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts  and the only two events subject to almost universal assent are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate    There is a significant debate about his nature his actions and his sayings but most scholars agree that Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was born between BC and died  AD    that he lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere    and that he spoke Aramaic and perhaps also Hebrew and Greek although this has been disputed.    gtSince the th century a number of quests for the historical Jesus have taken place and historical critical methods for studying the historicity of Jesus have been developed. Various Christian and nonChristian sources are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus e.g. Jewish sources such as Josephus and Roman sources such as Tacitus These sources are compared and contrasted to Christian sources such as the Pauline Letters and the Synoptic Gospels These sources are usually independent of each other e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process.  gtgtImage iInteresting Sources for the historicity of Jesus | Christ myth theory | Resurrection of Jesus | The Christ Myth Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcigtrca oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecigtrca.

1390112,0,t3_2a1aab,There are plenty of lodges particularly in Europe that dont have it. None of them are considered regular by Lodges in the English tradition of universal Freemasonry and as such are outside the worldwide system of loosely interconnected Grand LodgesLodges.When you join a regular Lodge you become a member of one of tens of thousands of Lodges around the world that will accept you as a Brother.When you join an irregular lodge you join a group recognized by anywhere from no other Lodges to a network of dozens or even hundreds of lodges in various countries depending on how long that group has been around and how much they have differentiated themselves from regular Freemasonry. One possible comparison would be the difference between the Catholic Church and say the  Westboro Baptist Church.  Both represent themselves as Christian Churches one has millions of followers in thousands of parishes around the world the other is a handful of people in one small town in America. Some of these irregular lodges offer something very close to what we practice while leaving God out of it others are little more than dressed up pyramid schemes designed to part you from your cash. You may want to look into Le Droit Humaine  or something in the UK connected torecognized by the Grand Loge de France. Both admit athiests the former also admits women and both have a level of legitimacy that comes from years of succesful existence. Neither would qualify as regular in the eyes of the UGLE however and their members would not be welcome at UGLE Lodge meetings. Pretending to believe in a higher power in order to join a regular Lodge would have you enter on false pretenses and make a mockery of your personal convictions and the obligations you would undertake in joining. Its not a strategy I would recommend. Masonry is a secular group for religiousspiritual people. If youre not a religious person you will need to find another organization better suited to you whether pseudoMasonic or otherwise.,freemasonry,ciqj5kd,8,t5_2qn38
1396730,0,t3_2a4297,Im going to plead ignorance and ask some stupid questionssay some stupid things. Its still Moronic Monday somewhere so Ill blame my failings on that. Feel free to gleefully point out my misconceptions and ignorance. Do me the favor of reading the whole comment if youre going to take the time to rip it apart. One aside before I risk hurting feelings I really love this whole community its the one place I can talk about this sort of nittygritty stuff and know the people who disagree with me are just as interested in the topic.TLDR This sort of thing belongs in collation halls and lodge rooms not on petitions involving the Federal government. Also this petition makes very little sense in the first place.Ill make my point as best I can using text from the petition and its claimed precedent.gt Grand Lodges of Freemasons began in  in London England.Correct me if Im wrong but...thats not objectively true is it? The UGLE united in  but Masonry predates it in several other iterations and locations which already had their own Grand Lodges. The several Grand Lodges that became UGLE were not the only ones present in  and even if those GLs dont recognize each other it doesnt mean ours has de facto global legitimacy any more than the Catholics can claim the Greek Orthodox as phonies solely on the basis that our Pope isnt their Pope. I get that the point is to stop anyone from setting up shop with a square and a compass but why ask for an American federal ruling on the issue?Speaking of whichgt This process in proving legitimate origins has been upheld in the case of Supreme Grand Lodge Modern Free Accepted Masons of the World vs. Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Georgia Docket no.  United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.I went and looked at the abstract to this case dammit Jim Im not a lawyer. Its a case from the s the PHGL of Georgia lodge claimed infringement by the Supreme Grand Lodge of Modern Free amp Accepted Colored Masons of the World. The PHGL argued the SGL shouldnt use the SampC and Mason name because the PHGL hadnt given them a charter and therefore the SGL werent real Masons thereby defrauding their members. The problem was that both lodges traced their legal incorporation to the SAME CHARTER DOCUMENT one given in Alabama and the other in Georgia and both had been operating lodges amp granting charters in Georgia for decades. Despite the Georgia court ruling in the PHGLs favor every one of the judges pointed out that NEITHER organization had a Masonic charter from anyone else but the PHGL had been around longer and was legally incorporated in Georgia while the SGL was legally incorporated in Alabama. There are some pretty fun comments in the dissent such as gt It seems to me in the light of the rule the opinion lays down that a warrant or charter from a recognized Masonic body would be required in order to constitute a legally existing Masonic organization according to Masonic history and Jurisprudence if that has anything to do with the case it is the pot calling the kettle black when the plaintiff calls the defendant illegitimate.This precedent seems to be not just flimsy but contradictory to the argument in the White House petition that all GLs in the world must link to UGLE to be legal. The PHGL appears to have argued for its LEGAL right to the use of the symbols in the state of Georgia not its MASONIC right. The court as best I understand it focused their decision on the lodges rights in Georgia but recognized the legitimacy of the lodge in Alabama. They basically said you cant use those words here because thats what theyre doing but where youre based youre totally Masons. Doesnt that seem to contradict the spirit of the White House petition?One last stupid questioncomment about thisgt All Grand Lodges in the world must have a direct lineage to this Grand Lodge to be Masonically legal. I cant see how All Grand Lodges in the world is under the jurisdiction of the White House nor how Masonically Legal should be something we even WANT the government involved in. The only way I can see the federal govt being involved is if these organizations are applying for tax benefits or exemptions as charitable organizations. Even then I dont see how their Masonic legality applies to the Feds the government will verify their affiliations before handing out an exemption the same way they differentiate between religious institutions and religious institutions that are really forprofit tax havens. That differentiation has NOTHING to do with what the other lodgeschurches say about them and all to do with their legal incorporation. The govt often doesnt have a great track record for this but its not the job of other churcheslodges to point upstarts out to the feds. That would be a waste of time and make them appear petty and unfocused on their stated goals of ethical guidance relief and community among others. The idea of consumer protection isnt supported either at least not by the petition or its precedent. Anyway my two cents.

I went page by page thru AZ code to find info as I was subject to that Jurisdiction at the time. Seriously I would suggest you research this for your Grand Lodge. It will be quite enlightening no matter what you find. Ask around amongst your Grand Lodge Officers. It is the most interesting Masonic study subject ever for me.,freemasonry,ck1iepa,0,t5_2qn38

This gives everyone practice opening a business meeting and unless the WM has something he really wants to accomplish it gives the SW practice with running the business meetings too. We typically use a protem candidate usually a brother that regularly attends meetings but might be too busy to take an officers seat or maybe a guy that went to a oneday class and this is his chance to go through the degree himself. While the first couple attempts are practice everyone puts in a lot of work to make sure they get it right. We have a quick run through the night before and anyone thats unsure about anything can ask their questions. If anyones not sure whether theyll be able to do their part theyre free to not move up but that doesnt happen often.So while moving up is a form of practice and it might not be as polished as if everyone stayed in their regular chairs we make sure that its something that were it a regular candidate seeing it for the first time they would be just as impressed as if wed sat our regular seats.Were moving up to do an EA tonight Ill be sitting in the East. Were doing an EA because thats our inspection degree this year so everyone has  months of practice starting tonight.

1983154,0,t3_2hf8c3, year old Mason here. I think this is the crux of the whole dwindling numbers issue. The way I see it Freemasonry became diluted back in the ss. It was made into a boys club where men could get away from their wives. Now that that is really not as big of an issue there has become an identity crisis. The depth of Freemasonry is lost. The surface is all the old timers care about. I have grown very disillusioned with my lodge. All we ever do is pump candidates in. Every meeting is either st nd or rd degree with an official visit mixed in here and there. When I asked for further depth in what we do I was told Thats never going to happen you want it you have to do it on your own My feelings are that this is a waste. The rituals are great and all but if all we do is recite and perform them without delving into their meaning then they too are a waste. There is a lot of depth in the Blue Lodge degrees that is never explored. What do the allegories mean what are the lessons we are supposed to learn from them? Shouldnt that discussion have a place in Lodge? Ive pretty much stopped going at this point because I cant sit through the  same thing over and over and over again. The old timers dont see it as a problem and I think that in and of itself is the problem. Sorry...rant over...hopefully all that made sense.,freemasonry,cks65is,9,t5_2qn38

2013626,0,t3_2hscou,Okay true story timeI was  JW  and per my lodge tradition I was doing my first EA degree. And yes while Ive often complained that the JW should not be doing the EA I have to admit that I  and my officers  totally rocked it. I checked with the WM. Im wearing the hat so I can do anything I want right? Yup sure no prob have a great time. So I did something that Id never seen any other Master do I got up from the big chair and delivered parts of the lectures and degrees down on the floor with the candidates. Grabbed them walked them whatever I thought would work I had rehearsed it privately all week and even though it was my first time I totally pwned that role. In fact we had several rehearsals and almost every single officer was almost flawless in both ritual and floorwork.Afterward the entire lodge congratulated us. Well except for one PM. Of course. He read me the riot act for getting out of the chair and then proceeded to tell me that waving my arms and gesticulating was too distracting and made it look like I was some kind of actor in a bad play. Etc. etc. I was a little upset at first but later decided that this had been one of the best EA degrees in this lodge in the previous  years the sum of my actual experience and kept on doing what I had been doing for the next three years. Our lodge became known for its ritual work and we were asked to help a number of other lodges around the state for the next several years. That one PM continued to complain. I didnt hate him for it because Ive learned to subdue my passions I just tried to keep in mind that not everyone is going to think that everything you do is wonderful. Some people really really like the old ways. Its comfortable its what they are used to and in their mind its the right way. ,freemasonry,ckvu78r,2,t5_2qn38

2086729,0,t3_2iqrql,As a Millenial Im certainly a fan of being selective and ensuring applicants are of good character but it sounds like this gentleman may just be more introverted. The values that we look for in new brothers should span generations which is one of my favorite parts of Masonry. I recommend looking for opportunities to get him out with you guys to get to know him better even if its as simple as Hey a few brothers are grabbing a beer tonight want to join?Theres no harm in being direct in asking about his motives. My committee pretty much grilled me on that topic but I could tell they were doing it because they really cared about their lodge ritual and history which I could respect. I wouldnt worry too much about depth most people dont have a full deep understanding of themselves at . I recognize that even as a young man Im still changing which I hope continues through life. The question is just whether you see evidence of poor character or mercenary motives as opposed to a man seeking to develop himself. If we only accepted men with a perfect knowledge of themselves and no need for selfimprovement our moral teachings wouldnt be of much use. More than anything get to know the guy better. The underlying values we seek should become evident regardless of generation if theyre in there. ,freemasonry,cl52i51,2,t5_2qn38

2326246,0,t3_2lxnhg,We use both a website and a Facebook page for public interface. There is a twicemonthly email that goes out to all the Brethren but it is mostly just the minutes and the summons. For a mostly Brethrenonly community we use Facebook groups and quite effectively I think. Not everyone is on FB but most are including our two most senior PMs. We have even seen a couple of middleaged Brethren subscribe to Facebook just to partake in what the page offers. We have a large segment of our Brethren who are either  miles from the Lodge with work schedules that dont generally permit attendance or completely outside the country most of our members are expats who generally spend less than  years here. Regular event invites and photos of events new candidates  and even just post meeting Harmony allow those Brothers to maintain a connection to the Lodge that would otherwise be impossible. We have a couple of Brothers who travel  miles  or more times a month because their schedule allows it and others that we are lucky to see more than once or twice a year because of work conflicts. Brethren use our Facebook group to send apologies for missing meetings from across town and around the world and those we dont see very often are sometimes greeted by new Brethren whom they have never met but keep up to date with via Facebook. While a useful tool for those Lodges with members unable to attend I dont think a good online community would discourage lax attendees any more so. Online communities are useful but are no substitute for the actual Lodge experience when its available. ,freemasonry,clz8k5w,2,t5_2qn38

Finally the problem of Why bad things happen to good people the title of a good book on the subject is at least as old as the Book of Job.  It seems to me that many times the problem with not believing in God is that of having a limited literal dare I say fundamentalist? definition of God and then saying Of course I cant believe in that.  A major message of the Bible or any religion is finding God not in prosperity but in pain and death and setbacks.  Good luck Brother.  Step back for a while.

If you can answer Yes when asked if you believe in a supreme being then youre good to go... However remember that is not the only requirement. Theyre a lot really nice Gd fearing people out there who are not the right fit for our fraternity. My lodge does a criminal background check calls references does interviews. You need two Master Masons In good standing who youve known for at least  months to sign your petition before it can even be submitted for consideration. Then every member of the lodge votes on it. We do all of this because we are trying understand a mans character.

3248283,0,t3_2uduby,I have to say the G puzzles me the most.  I have not heard a definitive explanation of what it stands for.  Everything else in Masonry is represented by symbols not words or letters and there is an alphabet in the middle of the most important emblem.  The B and J on the column are only shown occasionally and are well explained in the lectures.  On my MM certificate all the SampC do not have the G in it.  And yet especially in the States SampC with the G is everywhere in fact it is hard to find a SampC without the G. Does it stand for God or Geometrician?  Why not A for Architect?So my thinking goes the G must represent something I do not know yet. As I was taught the every symbol in Masonry has a meaning I have not earned the privilege to know this yet.Thank you brothers for trying to explain to me the meaning of the G.

Could I do that through action and language and a thousand other little things?  Sure! but I do this in addition to those other things or at least I try.If your lodge is mostly comprised of working men in the same field where youre very likely to be called out at a moments notice Ive got no problem at all with that sort of dress.

3971292,0,t3_35y9gy,gt Q My personal belief is that there is a God.That is all that will be asked of you. Full stop. Your answer is yes. Further explanation will not be asked nor is it necessary to provide such.gt What do people mean by Magic in the Freemasons?Which people do you mean? People outside of Freemasonry saying there is magic in it? Or Freemasons? There is no Masonic stance on magick. There are some individual Masons who study it and . of Masons who probably dont. In various Scottish Rite degrees there are mentions of alchemy and a strong suggestion that one study the kabbalah. There are hermetic and gnostic groups that might explore these topics further but for the most part they dont have a prerequisite of their members also being Masons. I know Masons in the OTO and various Golden Dawn Rosicrucian and Martinist groups. The founder of modern Wicca Gerald Gardner was a Mason. As was Crowley though the group he joined wasnt recognized. There are contemporary magick authors like Lon Milo Duquette and Poke Runyon who are Masonsbut they also belong to lots of other groups theyre not just Masons. And theres certainly an argument to be made that someone whos on their own path of magickal development might be well served by experiencing and studying the initiatory practices of Freemasonry. But theres nothing inherently magickal about Masonic rituals in my opinion. Not saying it couldnt be done that way but I havent seen them done with that intent.,freemasonry,cr8yl5k,1,t5_2qn38

It was a condition of bondage which developed primarily during the High Middle Ages in Europe and lasted in some countries until the midth century.Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land and in return were entitled to protection justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lords fields but also his mines forests and roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society and the Lord of the Manor and his serfs were bound legally economically and socially. Serfs formed the lowest social class of feudal society.,freemasonry,crbkwag,3,t5_2qn38

After all why should someone charter a new Lodge when there are so many Lodges that need helpsavingfixing?!gtthose Lodges are a great place for brethren to go and instill life and exert themselves in creating a Lodge all of their own. Its a lot easier to build up from a foundation than it is to lay that foundation itself.Im not so sure. Bring some new Brethren in who desire positive changes in order to raise standards a bit and the resistance with which they will meet is ridiculous. Example I wanted to seriously up the ante when it came to food in my Lodge for my year as Junior Warden. I even enrolled in a cooking course to increasebroaden my skill set and knowledge. I quickly realized that in order to do this I needed only two things A little bit of money. People dont drink enough so the bar doesnt provide as much funding as people think it should. To know how many people are coming. Tell me that I have to cook for exactly fifteen people and Ill make some excellent food. Tell me it could be between twelve and thirty five and quality is necessarily going to take a dive.I suggested that we simply charge a few dollars five dollars or less basically chump change and make every meal a ticketed meal. Not so much to cover expenses as that could always just be taken out of our dues...but to know exactly how many people were coming.Simple idea simple to execute good probable results. It was shot down and met with tons of resistance because well thats not the way its done at most other Lodges despite there being an exception here already and weve never done it that way before.Most other ideas like this would get shot down as well I assume.

4856874,0,t1_cu6nq2g,The Imperial Potentate overruled the GampA Committee on the MI matter.  It is my view he was in error and he needlessly complicated relations. The individual who advised him is no longer in the position.I heard both of the AR cases. The first was based on the problematic Shrine provision recognizing expulsion for only a Shrine offense.We found that being a tavern keeper was not a Shrine offense.  Our decision was not based on the evidence that the individual was not a tavern keeper as the license was in his wifes name.  The SC ruling was based on the failure of the Shrine to confirm suspended Masons would be barred.  No SC Masons were ever identified.  See Again the Imperial Potebtate could have handled this in a far better manner such as requesting a list of SC Masons suspended or expelled and promising to promptly remove them there being no stays of Shrine Suspension at that point.  I think the fraternity would be better served if there was an unqualified removal of Shrine membership for loss of the prerequisite body.  Unfortunately abuses as seen in Arkansas have inflamed the Imperial Representatives and I suspect such a proposal would be shouted down. ,freemasonry,cu6qur4,1,t5_2qn38

4985031,0,t3_3j6q2j,If youre really interested theres a book called Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? That delves into a few of your questions.I think a lot of the criticism is directly because we keep things private. We arent hiding our actions or intentions because we have to. If the craft had responded to the criticism with transparency centuries ago there wouldnt be any conspiracy. But we hold our tongues.Even still all of our secrets are online or appeared in books centuries ago. As time went on people grew less tolerant of things they didnt understand and less trusting of things they werent involved in. As far as the specifics of mysticism I can only assume its people wanting to separate us even further. When they saw what we actually do and realized it was to them boring they looked for more salacious details. In comes Leo Taxil and in a different way Albert Pike. People chose to believe Taxil even though he was known as a rabble rouser at the time and admitted his lies years later. People still quote him and run with it. Its  made up. Pike was definitely revered and in a position of influence but Morals and Dogma was a book of his personal faith and opinions. It was given to new members of the Scottish Rite not the same as freemasonry as a whole but only in the southern jurisdiction and that gift tradition ended decades ago. And yet people still quote him as though he is the one true expert on freemasonry and Morals and Dogma is the official textbook for all masons everywhere. Again it was only ever widely accepted in one region of one country in one offshoot of freemasonry and hasnt been in years. TLDR A lie told often enough becomes the truth but universal truth is not measured in mass appeal. Being moderate doesnt make the news. You have to earn someones trust. ,freemasonry,cumvpl9,13,t5_2qn38
5017261,0,t1_cuqrco7,gt Except its not something really all that different than a LodgeRyan please understand that Freemasonry everywhere else is not like what you see in your home lodge. Nor in my own lodge. A few years ago a bunch of guys wanted to see something different in Masonry so they started the Masonic Restoration Society. Not that they were actually restoring anything but we got the concept of Traditional Observance which while not actually traditional turns out to be a pretty cool thing and a lot of Masons seem to enjoy it. Similarly there are a handful of lodges that are styled as European Concept Lodges which while not actually European since Europe is a pretty big place have some cool ideas about how to hold meetings and has a lot of people pretty excited about it. Recently we had a thread or two on having small lodges that dont need to have a building but that could meet in hotel meeting rooms. And we learned that some guys actually do this. Its not for everyone but its a model that has some people interested. What Nick and Tiki are proposing is yet another spin on how to have a lodge and from what Ive discussed with them its really fascinating. We have readers here from all over the US including Canada and the rest of the world. My guess is that somebody else is going to find this conception pretty interesting and may want more information.

5951143,0,t3_3wxpb3,Hi Drew. I havent joined a lodge in Melb yet but I am a Mason living there. My mother lodge is  Ibis in NSW.Short answer Ring up your local lodge or email them. Say youre interested. If youre not a criminal and you believe theres a supermen power in the universe theyll either be happy to get you started or refer you to someone who can. Please be patient. Theres paperwork involved and it takes time.Long answer It firstly comes down to what youre near. For at least the first half a year youll be led through rituals and experiences that pretty much any temple can put you through. There are major lodges in Preston Mount Waverley the CBD ... If you want a fairly small and intimate lodge in my opinion the larger ones have a lot more power and drama to a ritual along with good advice and less importantly connections then you can Google one in your suburb. Different lodges have different personalities and focuses. For example the Shrine in Collingwood mostly focus on charity and wearing a fez. Lodge Garibaldi in Brunswick has many Italian speakers. It can be argued that Masonry was a major part of Italys founding.The thing is were not that secretive. If you just get in contact with one of these lodges whose details are available online theyll treat you like a brother as soon as they know youre interested. As the brethren told me the night I expressed my interest dont be shy.,freemasonry,cxzq3pa,1,t5_2qn38

6030151,0,t1_cya26nc,Well like the once a Christian thing we will more than likely have differing opinions here. One cannot unsee what they have seen as they say. I belonged to a fundamental Christian church in my late teens. Actually experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit. About the time I got involved in Freemasonry my Christian views were developing toward the new age philosophy of Unity School of Christianity. Letting all my studies of comparative religion and philosophy as well as lifes experience play out I woke up one morning and realized that I was Deist. Took a long time to get there but I finally made it. My Christian experiences are a vital part of my present belief system so a big part of who I am is indeed Christian. Cannot undo that. It is a part of me. I guess you are technically correct that if one were to fully renounce Freemasonry he would not be considered a Mason by anyone including himself. But you cannot unInitiate yourself. That experience is forever a part of you no matter how far you would want to distance yourself from it.

Were a society of guidelines and each Grand Lodge figures out what they mean to them and then others get to react. If anything Id say that the US is a great example of that noble contention of who best can work.

If he is not a strong ritualist he should assemble a degree team within the Lodge that confers strong degrees. If he is not strong at programming he should create a committee that designs strong programs within the Lodge. If he is not well versed in Masonic Law then he should know to ask for guidance.

7252549,0,t3_4epzyq,The issue in my eyes is not one where I condemn Georgia or Tennessee for their religious views exercising democracy or advancing the argument that they are sovereign entities. Instead these are instances where the majority is using law as a means to selectively persecute a minority within their Grand Lodge.A majority vote and the passage of a law is not necessarily indicative of the fact that the legislation is not subject to criticism or unlawful. There are numerous instances within the history of our own country where democracy has been exercised a majority consensus has been reached by Congress the bill has been signed into law by the President and then years or decades later that law is found to be unconstitutional and struck from the books. The argument against Georgia and Tennessee therefore is one where I simply view the legislation as unlawful within the context of Masonic Law.With that being said the Ancient Landmarks are analogous to the US Constitution and serve as the supreme law of our Craft. Even though there are different interpretations of what constitutes the Ancient Landmarks the concept of equality of man and equality of religion is universally accepted. Even though the laws passed by TN and GA were passed by a majority GA did have a vote on it the laws banning homosexuals from being members of Freemasonry are considered moral law on the basis of the Bible by these jurisdictions and pay no heed to denominations with differing views on sexual orientation. Furthermore homosexuality was not an issue in Freemasonry until the passage of the TN law in the s as homosexuals such as Oscar Wilde were initiated into the Craft previously. The law prohibiting homosexuals therefore is unlawful simply because it seeks to establish one particular religious view over others despite homosexuality not being an issue for centuries and contrary to the opinion of several Masonic legal scholars regarding the legislation of moral law i.e. Mackey Anderson etc.. The end result is that the law of GA and TN represents a major deviation from widely accepted Masonic law and practices and is unlawful.Furthermore you seem to be unaware of some of the things that have happened in Georgia and Tennessee since this law has been enacted and upheld. The Grand Senior Warden of TN was voted out of office solely on the basis that he voted to repeal the law against homosexuals and they did not want to risk him issuing an edict as Grand Master repealing the law. Members of the Grand Lodge of TN and GA are afraid to express their views about the law in Lodge or in public owing to the fact that it can result in expulsion. The Grand Master of TN is threatening charges against Park Avenue Lodge where the two homosexual Brethren belonged because of the fact they supported their Brethren and could potentially wind up having their charter pulled.  In the past decade Georgia has prosecuted a Worshipful Master for conferring the degrees on an African American along with enacting policies that are designed to oust homosexuals from the Fraternity.While I respect jurisdictional sovereignty and a Grand Lodges right to selfdetermination I am vehemently against the concept of jurisdiction being used as a justification to enact unlawful legislation or to engage in unlawful acts. While I agree that Freemasonry should never devolve to the point where the views of the minority should eclipse those of the majority on a regular basis it is far more dangerous when the views of the majority are unlawfully utilized to target and persecute the minority because there is no recourse. That is why it is so disheartening for me to see Grand Lodges not taking a stronger stand against this sort of conduct in the Fraternity and offering aid and relief to those who are oppressed by these laws. ,freemasonry,d22k9wd,7,t5_2qn38

So they were founded with some dissent among local Lodges had a competing GL spring up and then merge with them within  years still without quite covering all of the Lodges in Canada as it then existed  years later the definition of Canada was expanded to include more territory and another extant GL and then only two years later the Grand Lodge of Quebec formed presumably undoing the majority of the prior amalgamation for Upper and Lower Canada all within  years. How many name changes over how many years did it take to go from the Premier Grand Lodge of London to the UGLE?

Being that its going to be in a residential area the streets may not be able to handle the traffic if the lodge becomes popular. Also it maybe a good idea to keep in mind the other groups when making this since the building is being made from the ground up. Depending on how far the scottish rite york rite eastern star etc is in your area or the next blue lodge that supports them. This is the time to think about making the building available to them.On top of this this maybe the time to think about making the building in a way it can get some side income. I heard of some lodges having a multi story and they will have a coffee shop or something renting out space. This not only brings in extra jobs and income in the area. This also advertises Freemason without spending anything.BTW Charlotte is one of the places Im thinking about moving to when I get done with school.

This set us on the property ladder until  when we decided to become renters from the local Scottish Rite and managed to sell our building at the height of the market.We have the proceeds invested with a professional manager overseen by a threeperson special trustee committee. This enables the trustees to take a handsoff approach generally it saves a lot of conflict and headaches so we find the management fees worth it. We budget for the calendar year drawing  of the fair market value of this restricted fund as of Sept  of the previous year no matter what the actual earnings. This gives us a fairly consistent income and a slight growth over inflation for the long term.Not only does this policy promote harmony within the lodge it allows us to be generous within and without the Masonic community.

I mean you have to wonder how things went when say... a black guy petitioned successfully for the first time in a state. Did the GL give the go ahead or lay down a decree? Or did a lodge accept the man and then the GL said... well thats finally settled. Lets just let that keep rolling at the will and pleasure of the Master and the lodge. I honestly dont have a horse in this race I find it an interesting thought exercise in regards to our traditions how our rules evolve without innovating.

BCampY has Lodges working Emulation Canadian similar to but different from Emulation Ancient PrestonWebb based and Australian Rituals I understand there is one Lodge in Ontario that bucks the GLCitPoO trend of exclusively using the Canadian work to work an Irish Ritual instead. Presumably QLD Lodges work Emulation Ritual by default with some few Lodges working an Irish or Scottish Ritual for historical reasons.

8800064,0,t3_50nk4u,The blazing stars entry in Mackeys masonic encyclopedia  goes on and on with very little description of how it actually looks. Mackey writing as a nonmason at the time buries at the end of his entry a conjecture that a blazing star is properly shown as two five pointed stars one over the other. He does not cite any actual recorded examples of this conjecture.  Mackeys version remains not very common if at all used in historical masonic tracing boards which since they were and are painted by masons for masons for use in masonic rituals remain the most authoritative source of masonic symbolic imagery.Nor are blazing stars determined by the number of points the star has. The most common way blazing stars are depicted is by having lines emanating from the stars center between the star points sometimes short sometimes very long sometimes wavy to show flaming like the flaming sword that guards Eden and other times straight. There is conjecture that is this is to show God emanating from the star the way that Mosess face shone light after speaking with God on Mount Sinai. However this makes little sense. After all a star already shines light. Why would you show extra light coming off a star and why? Isnt a star already made of light? For a while it was believed to show it was a moving star like the comet that was the Star of Bethlehem and some imagery shows comets with emanation lines as well. But then emanation lines are used to also indicate the Sun which is not a divine star. Quite simply the symbolic imagery is very confused.Heraldry indicates there may be another explanation. In heraldry blazon simply means to describe or depict armorial bearings in a correct heraldic manner. There was likely a confusion between a blazon star which means a star depicted by heraldry that led to the modern idea of a blazing star.A blazing star most probably originally just meant a star as depicted in heraldry. Which would have made perfect sense to our ancient brethren in their Medieval Guild.  Since Freemasonrys origins are English a blazon star would be five pointed with straight sides as it sounds you have depicted. ,freemasonry,d75nc3j,2,t5_2qn38

9042922,0,t1_d7ybgia,Hey we dont need a disagreement to require or acquire some whisky. lol But I would like to respond because I believe you misunderstood some of what I was saying. When will we stop repeating Michael Mair and Antoine Fabre dOlivet?I havent looked into their works so Im not repeating anything relative to their work at least not knowingly. Im going directly off of documentation of the craft and whats actually in it.Masonic ritual is not history. The Regius Poem is a myth not a collection of facts. The Eccosais rituals were fabricated not unknown truths.I never said the ritual was history and not based on mythology. In fact I quite clearly asserted that there is no direct lineage and that the influence is in the ideology itself. Claiming that I asserted otherwise is disingenuous or perhaps you simply misconceived what I was stating. The only thing I am asserting is that ancient Egyptian beliefs and teachings have had a great deal of influence of Freemasonry as have many other ancient beliefs. Its funny. No one denies that Freemasonry was influenced by other particular ancients sources but for whatever reason many modern Freemasons deny the Egyptian influence even though that is probably the secondary ancient influence in terms of the teachings. Masonic ritual can only comment on Freemasonry not on History.I know which is exactly why I said Freemasons need to be aware that Masonry cant rewrite history and therefore cannot dispute particular influences when we know the actual history reveals the source of these ideas. Not one of the ideas we value today as Masons originates in Egypt ancient or otherwise. And if they did that would render the valueless.Thats simply not true. I actually already refuted that with a quote where Pike andor Hutchens asserts that the inspiration for the belief in the immortality of the soul as it relates to Freemasonry was inspired by the ancient Egyptians belief in the immortality of the soul. They actually specifically start talking about the Book of the Dead so you cant even refute that. The belief in the immortality of the soul is actually a core tenet of the craft if youre not aware its even stated in the craftsmen handbooks and if I recall it might also be stated in the craft itself. To every Mason the soul of man is immortal.  Albert Pike. Morales and Dogma p. The power of the values and ideals espoused by the Craft is predicated on not their origin but their timelessness. As long as there are or have been or will be humans those values and ideals will be true because they are true to the human condition.By what right can you claim that the origin of these ideas dont matter? Even the early documentation of the craft emphasize the origin of these ideas and therefore its clearly of great interest and importance to the craft. YOU do not get to individually decide otherwise when such significance is placed into the craft and the documentation itself. Thats another thing I was implying when I said Freemasons dont get to rewrite history. You dont get to say its not important when it was clearly important to the very men who founded the craft. If you had to assign an origin to those ideas it would be somewhere in the Neolithic Revolution when we evolved into the hardware and software we use today.Thats actually true. If youve ever read into Philip Liebermans work he believes the belief in immortality is actually traceable to the first intentional burials as it indicates regard for the afterlife. A lot of other beliefs can be traceable to later times as well. The source for that regarding Lieberman is below if you ever want to read into that. Its pretty interesting stuff at least to me. Theres also a great book called The History of Religious Ideas which is also very informative. Lieberman . Uniquely Human. Cambridge Mass. Harvard University Press. ISBN The importance of the origin is where the idea came from in relation to the craft and if it asserts that it came from a particular time or region then that is where we should be concerned. If say I studied ancient Egypt and then made an order on that basis then I would say the origin of the orders teachings are in ancient Egypt. Ideologically that would be true regardless of whether or not the ideas could technically be traceable to earlier times. Regardless the more widely known and influential of these ideas can often be traced to ancient Egypt though. Theres actually plenty of good books on it too. For example heres a good piece on the influence Egypt had on the origin of Greek culture. And obviously the Greek culture then transmitted many of those ideas into other cultures. In fact Pike has mentioned in one of the quotes I put in the first response that the teachings came from Egypt but where watered down and changed after being transmitted into other nations and so on.,freemasonry,d7ytc1d,2,t5_2qn38

After the destruction of the first temple the great Cyrus who was initiated in all our mysteries instituted Zorobabel grand master of the lodge in Jerusalem and ordered him to lay the foundations of the second temple wherein the mysterious book of Solomon was deposited.  This book was preserved for twelve centuries in the temple of the Israelites but after the destruction of the second temple under emperor Titus and the dispersion of this people this authentic record was lost until the time of the crusades when it was partly recovered after the taking of Jerusalem.

9921027,0,t3_5hexyy,I dont really follow why you would be addressing this question to an American discussion forum or trying to research it on the Internet rather than to your Proposer and Seconder which is the correct thing to do and they will have surely told you this.The Obligation that you will actually take is not taken in Gods name but in the sight of God because all things are and you just confirm that you recognise that fact when taking your Obligation. The Obligation itself is to your Lodge that is the group of men who you would meet with to the Grand Lodge and to Freemasonry in general that you will not break its rules. The fact that you will make this promise on the Bible is something that has been done in Christian countries for  years and is clearly not to the detriment of God.However I would sincerely suggest that you do not progress with your application to join until such time that you have talked this through with your Proposer Seconder and the Secretary of the the Lodge as you are quite obviously not ready to join Freemasonry in your heart nor are you prompted to join having a favourable opinion preconceived of the Institution.

I am in full agreement with you that something made by hand is intrinsically more valuable than something store bought. When I was installed as Master of my lodge I was presented with a hand turned gavel by the Junior Past. It is a treasure. My ring was hand made by a Brother down in Texas. I bought it from his website. It is still bought but made by a brother and not in a factory someplace. It is a treasure. I make by hand any gift I give to Brothers. I have given many pieces that I have carved to Brothers along with drawings and wood burnings. I enjoy creating them and hope the Brothers that receive them enjoy them. I give my stuff away for free but I dont expect that every mason should give his art away simply because it is Masonic. I am not a professional artist and dont make my living that way. This post was originally intended to get some input on the quality of the art and the design. To get a feel for if Brothers like it or not. Ultimately I had intended to give this Apron as a gift to the first Brother I raise which should be coming up here in February. This young brother is also my candidate so I am mentoring him.  I myself cant afford to buy an illuminated apron but I can paint one myself  granted not to the same standard. It is fascinating to me to hear the opinions of everyone on this thread. I appreciate all of the opinions expressed especially those that disagree with me. Almost immediately this thread became less about the apron I painted and more about whether or not an apron should be embellished and further whether or not a painted apron represents an elitism creeping back into the Craft. I admit that this is an aspect of the discussion I hadnt considered. ,freemasonry,db6xog2,0,t5_2qn38
9970167,0,t3_5icijy,H. L. Haywood writes in How to Become a Masonic Lodge Officergt The anteroom is a part of the Lodge room stands in its own precincts is not a separate room like a club or a lobby and therefore the decorum and etiquette of the Lodge room governs it. Since the Tiler is in charge of it in the same sense that the Master is in charge of the Lodge room he is responsible to the Master to see that etiquette is observed. It should be clean and neat with no litter lying about the furniture in place aprons correctly placed and piled the light where it belongs and nothing stored in it which does not belong in it. Loud talking joking noise needless moving about these are not permissible. The Tiler should introduce himself to a visiting Brother the moment he enters the AnteRoom and should see that he has a seat if he must wait before entering the Lodge room or while waiting for an Examining Committee. The door to the Lodge room is in the Junior Deacons custody not the Tilers the Tiler should never open it or talk through it until after knocking. When a member of the Lodge enters the AnteRoom after Lodge is opened he is in it to observe a Ceremony of Entrance and this Ceremony should be conducted by the Tiler according to a fixed procedure and the procedure should be invariable never altered for any member or officer.In Macoys Worshipful Masters Assistant from  it says gt A quiet visit to the Tylers room of the Lodge will repay our curiosity. Has he the implement of his office both in hand and on his breast has he chairs comfortable cleanly and abundant for the brethren in waiting has he a desk or table for the Visitors Book has he convenient books closets and niches for hats overcoats and umbrellas has he suitable toiletrooms etc has he the means of ventilation in the sultry nights and of warmth in the chilly do you observe upon his door any peephole sliding panel or other appliance for playing the eavesdropper upon the Lodge. If so report it promptly to the Worshipful Master that it may be imperviously covered or immovably screwed in place and used no more! A Tylers room warm roomy fresh and sweet with a genial old man to fill it is an inviting place as many a reader of this volume will testify. As the official duties of the Tyler are concentrated in the anteroom and he claims no share in the work of the Lodge and no privilege to speak act or vote in the meetings it is proper that his apartments should be comfortable to himself and attractive to those who visit him.I would suggest that the tiler without the door stopped ALL from entering but it was the guard within the door Junior Deacon or other position depending on jurisdiction differences who actually admitted the visitor into the lodge and could thus try said visitor in the anteroom.,freemasonry,db751gv,6,t5_2qn38

Is this a valid concern?Depends on the area. Here in the USA it shouldnt be a problem or a big one. I understand in the UK at this time it might be.The fact is here in the USA no one really cares much about it one way or the other. Its like saying you know how to drive or you can do a back flip. The question they are going to ask is And....? or why are you telling me thisFrom my understanding in the UK it is more of a problem with political figures and cops. Something about the loudest people thinks there is some corruption going on I think the average person over there doesnt care.How secretive am I? Besides my parents and other family members knowing people I might have a relationship with and a few others. I dont really go out of my way to let people know I am one. While I do have a plate on my car I dont normally wear rings besides to meetings. While I do have stuff on my LinkedIn profile showing I am one I point out that its a charity group since major companies eat that stuff up.So Im not hiding it. But at the same time Im not really showing it off. The only real way you would know if I am one is if you knew which car is my car seen me go into lodge or you were looking up me anyways. Like there is given people I do hide it from. But as what swimbikerunrun said I rather not deal with the questions or if someone thinks its devil worshiping or whatever crap theyre saying this week with that being said if someone was talking crap about us I would bump them and let them know they can ask me questions to get their facts straightNote I have heard of some getting messed over. I cant remember where I seen this but some guy ran into problems with their boss found out he was one. Something about he was on call almost all the time and the boss was a super religious catholic. He was in lodge and didnt see she was calling him until after the meeting was over. He explain he goes to lodges and such and such days and she asked him if he knew they are a devil worshiping group. even with her having no relations with masonry and her actually asking a mason thisShe started to screw with him make false reports to get him fired and other things that could be viewed as discrimination. Because masons arent a religion he couldnt get any help from brothers or from lawyers on this matter. He basically had to request a transfer to get it to stop.So Im not going to act like it doesnt happen.

There there to honor and remember the brother. Then there handed down within the lodge to the next brother in line. Or in some cases that jewel is handed down to the next of kin in the lodge.  Also the high price tag for these things that end up on eBay are way to high for anyone interested in actually buying in my experience so then these pieces end up getting melted down and the brother then in the lodge only exists in name only and not in a symbolic way within the fraternity. Honestly again my opinion should my Jewel that my lodge chipped in for to purchase where to end up on eBay for  bucks then to be melted down and not provide any essence within my lodge Id be devastated. I guess in general my thought isIf the family doesnt want it they should return it to the lodge that their family member was a member too because there it would have a far more meaningful purpose within the lodge than it would some clandestine conspiracy nut metal collector or someone whos just gunna scrap it anyways.

10465946,0,t3_5pu2ll,So I made some major life decisions based on Office Space.What happened was that I had so many friends who had jobs they loved. They love going to work. Some of them make good money. Some dont. For a time I took lower paying jobs in areas that interested me. That just made me stress about money. So I took the higher paying soul sucking jobs. I decided basically that I will go to work to pay my bills. I make lists of things I need to do for the week. I knock through the list. Makes the time go by a little easier. It makes sure I do enough work to keep my job and be considered a good employee.When pm hits I slide out of there like Fred Flinstone down a dinosaurs tail. Then I go home and I engage in hobbies. Lots of hobbies. I see friends. I cook meals. I dont think about work. I listen to books on tape during my commute. Basically I reclaim every second of nonwork that used to get occupied by work. Then I go to work and they own me for  hours. Every so often I volunteer for a project at work that helps distract me. That keeps the malaise to a minimum. But basically I decided that Im going to enjoy my life even if I have to spend an appreciable amount of time doing something I absolutely dont enjoy. And yeah freemasonry plays into that. Because lodge has a lot of pageantry going on it gives you an almost other worldly escape. But first youve gotta flip that switch. My blood pressure was on the verge of killing me at one point. But I refuse to let work claim my life and my time.  ,freemasonry,dcuf6pq,5,t5_2qn38

10667092,0,t3_5shrdx,So I didnt want to be the one to bring this up because Im not from there and its not my story to announce it hit rconspiracy early yesterday but since its here now from what Ive read the article is misleading. He was not the Grand Master of the UGLE. He was Illustrious Grand Master of the Order of Royal and Select Masters for  years in the early s it appears from Google searches mostly cached articles since the Order of Royal and Select Masters web site is currently down and when it was up yesterday had already yanked the pages that mentioned him but they were still in the Google Cache.Frankly I think that this is the wrong approach. I think the Masons in England should get out in front of this and admit that they had a terrible person in a role of authority in a minor sidebody. This happens and its sad. But his immediate removal and the deference to legitimate authority stands as a testament to the falsehood of the absurd allegations that English antiMasonry has been leveling against the Fraternity for decades now.Over and over they claim that Freemasonry sees itself as above the law untouchable by police or judges and yet when one of their own our own even though Im American turns out to be on the wrong side of the law we immediately and without any controversy do the right thing.Mic drop.,freemasonry,ddg89uj,2,t5_2qn38

However if you joined to help better your community and your fellow man then start introducing ideas in to Lodge meetings for things the lodge can do.

I ordered another one from my Grand Lodge very plain but excellent new quality with my name embroidered in the back for only  total free shipping. Even if your Grand Lodge recommends a certain company your best bet is to listen to them. I learned that also with my officers tux better to match my fellow brethren then to look similar.
