2701806,0,t3_2r017z,I emailed LEGO themselves earlier this week to see if they could shed anymore light on this this was the replyDear MatthewThanks for getting in touch with us.Our BIONICLE fans are some of our most passionate ones and we always love hearing from you! I wish I had better news for you.I did some research for you Matthew. Sadly I do not see a launch date at this time for the UK. I only see a sneak peak under the products section of the website and not on the Shop yet.  I can see it is launching in the US as of January  . Keep checking to see its introduction in the UK it is because of fans like you that we brought BIONICLE back.Not sure what this means at the end of the day theres no definitive answer that this lovely Lego Customer Service Employee gave as to a UK release date but hopefully it is sooner rather than later  or it looks like Ill be importing from America. Anyway just thought Id leave this here for all you BionicleUK peeps like me.Proof of email ,bioniclelego,cnb6o1z,3,t5_2uxkr

2720267,0,t3_2r7whn,Well a new body piece is pretty much a must. They could also revamp the current CCBS armor pieces by adding pistons and stuff and keeping those  pegs for addons. Definitely some new feet too I miss variety.. Yes I know Onua has the big beast feet but thats just him! And as Chronix said more colored bones. I really hope we see the return of some more Bionicle colors. Having RedBrown and Purple being common now is amazing and I hope they stay but I really hope they take advantage of the unique enemies this Summer and have some Dark Blue Red etc armor. We already know there are Dark Blue and Red Skull Spiders so why not? Not to mention Dark Red is already on the CCBS roster Chi WorrizI think that was his name not sure. and Pyrox. So yeah.

There are also the two MNOG games which are fantastic plays and as always the movies are great fun. There were multiple online serials as well but since the site those were on was taken down Im not sure where you can find them.

2881016,0,t1_cnvk7zz,The last Bionicle games. You mean the two we had? Rather the two full titles? We had Bionicle which was the Mask of Light and we had Bionicle Heroes was was the Ignika Piraka arc. Thats it for full titles. Everything else has been small games. Well OK excluding the GBA titles. Those were decent IMO.Also Bionicle Heroes wasnt bad it just wasnt the right fit for a Bionicle game then.

He sucks but hes the best wrap your head around thatKanoka were the best collectiblesThe Stars line is kinda neat. I mostly enjoy having  Takanuva setsLoSS is a great setThe Legend Reborn wasnt bad just boringThe Bohrok are overrated. Yeah I said itThe Metruan were the best MARKETED Matoran sets. The actual best sets are the Protectors followed by the VoyatoranI like that G has a fresh start.

What they meant by the Vahi being half a mask is probably just the fact that it is literally just half a mask because it covers half of the wearers face whereas pretty much any other mask covered the whole face.,bioniclelego,co7zhy9,3,t5_2uxkr

4734545,0,t3_3cf4bc,I know Im a little late to the party  but Im new to this sub. My theory on this has been that the masks shape is governed by how powerful it is. Part of the job if a mask maker is to study how disk energy flows through the mask.  For every mask  there are certain contours and angles that produce the best results  but more simple mowers require a less specific shape.  Think of it kind of like feng shui.  Take the Miru for example.  The only real requirement would be a flowing  aerodynamic shape  whereas with something like the Olmak  its far more constrained to a certain for due to the forces at play.  When Vakama is forging the Vahi in the movie we see a large pile of masks with a fairly similar shape.  I always thought that was because that was the shape it had to be in order to correctly channel the energy. I know its also because its easy to just duplicate an asset in an animated scene as opposed to making a whole pile of different masks  but Im a take it as intentional ,bioniclelego,ctrbyjz,1,t5_2uxkr

ARE THOSE PURPLE EYES!? mfw The crystallic thing with the masks is pretty clear here the default masks have dualinjected transclear which looks neat. Once again that big fuckin gundrillhammer. More transpurple to the point its entirely his secondary color. Not seeing any solid purple on him. Hope that BFGDH comes with transpurple studs but it probably will to stand out from Korgot a bit. No more doubt that the torso is a new piece different from the Star Wars one. It was pretty obvious to begin with. Is that... An exposed shoulder balljoint?   NOT ENOUGH WATER WORST BONKLE But its a sign of an arm function. Something unorthodox like Bashers except slamming down the hammer with both arms instead of hugging.Tahu Some kind of Technic function with his swords. They may make up for the possible lack of gearbox or arm function in general. Really Im doubting Tahu has a gearbox. Those shells on his shoulders are highly suspect and the arms look connected at the default CCBS shoulder joint. Those gold feet look especially gross. I dont know what it is about gold . feet but they just look bad. How much you want to bet none of these sets come with gold hands? Weve never gotten gold  hands yet the closest you can get is in some knockoff sets and I dont trust them to last more than  years before they poof into dust because Gold Plastic Syndrome.Earth Creature Hard to tell what it is. Mole thingy? With this set you have pretty much everything you need to make a MOC of Mask Maker Makuta. Transpurple shortbones Umarak comes with the Mask of Control and Onua probably comes with transpurple eyes for extra measure!Winding down staring too deeply at these blurry pictures.

I mean there is but the main villain hasnt said a word or even truly attacked the Toa. Some Skull people and a spider are hardly villains though their sets were cool.It was a great idea to start with the mysterious feel but they havent progressed the storyline at all.

Keep in mind that this doesnt necessarily mean the line is ending but many believe it is an indication.

Like this they give almost nothing to the community only your weird poll fetish. Why are you even limiting this poll to these  when theres  caninically known teams in G?Mine is probably Nuju.

8810738,0,t3_4y1zut,Lohkvak The White ShadowOnce a race of legendary fourlegged hawks the Lohkvak rahi have mysteriously devolved into a clumsy lumbering oversized bird. Its once platinum wings have shriveled into pathetic white flappers its keen beak now blunt and its great claws decayed into little more than grasping fingers.Occasionally seen ambling around KoWahi its sluggishness compensated for by its size and reputation Turaga Nuju remembers the days when the birds now ancient form could be seen soaring across KoMetru. Its fall from greatness almost symbolises Mata Nuis slow death the Toa Metrus dishevelment to Turaga and the Matoran waking in smaller weaker forms.Technical story detailsThe Lohkvak were created by Makuta Gorast to feed passively of Mata Nuis life force as a mean to measure the health of the great spirit. Of course when Mata Nui entered his coma the Lohkvak weakened as well losing their avid character and becoming weaker slower versions of themselves.The deadly sin is sloth if you havent realised.Any feedback is welcome!,bioniclelego,d76xiyt,2,t5_2uxkr
