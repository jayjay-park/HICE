3494702,0,t1_cpqkmvg,gt I assumed you meant the standard uni setup where several people hand out a piece of work and then the class community in this case discusses them. Yes I was thinking of something like this. I discussed with another user here about the possible format for workshops. So far this is how I see it. People submit suggestions for a workshop prompt or theme. E.x. Writing with clarity Structuring a scene or writing dialogue. Users vote on the prompt they want. Once the prompt with the most votes is determined there is a post where people submit the criteria they think would make a successful submission for the prompt. The initial user who suggested the winning prompt makes a post asking for submissions. That user also includes the previously discussed criteria. People submit their work on the thread.. People critique others work on the same thread using the criteria as basis for what would be a successful writing prompt.That all seems a bit convoluted right now but Im thinking of ways to make it work. What do you think?,writingcraft,cpqmd82,2,t5_30fmk
