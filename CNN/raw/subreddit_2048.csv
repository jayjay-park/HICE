662507,0,t3_21f7bi,You could do walk over the array from the first to the last number   for each original number in the array that is not zero     look backwards for a target position that does not contain a zero unless it is position zero       if the target position does not contain the original number use the next position     if the target position is different from the original position       add the number to the number on the target position       replace the original number by zeroNB You need to add a stop variable to make sure any next slide will stop before it merges into this number again since double merges are not allowed.Also the test set from my c code  gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt   gt You can read about the slides algorithm here,2048,cgfkrt4,2,t5_30xgz

4405615,0,t3_3bhrvf,This is a decent concept. I did get to the  tile very quickly though.  and there doesnt seem to be a way to continue. I didnt use the undo button.There are a couple of flaws though. It seems unnecessarily crazy. There is an unnecessarily large amount of stuff going on that had no real impact and therefore was just hindering my concentration on the game. For instance the freeze tiles have almost no impact on the game it says they stop a tile moving I dunno if this is intended but they actually dont they just stop it combining. I also found swap tiles had almost no impact. Perhaps they would in tighter endings but they didnt happen mainly for another reason  the x tile is really overpowered. Ive played variations with a multiplier tile before  it didnt take long before I remembered that you can just wait for one to come in and then combine it with your highest tile not very difficult if youve been moving to anticipate one. You dont have to have a bad setup to take advantage of this you can have a solid one and it still does just fine. You can do this repeatedly to get a very large tile easily.The death tile also seems extremely cheap. I dunno if there is some form of protection that stops it picking high tiles as it never took my high tile in that game but it seems totally luckbased it just appears and takes a tile which may well be one of your high ones.This seems like an interesting megamix of lots of variations. With some tweaks and the ability to continue beyond  it could be pretty cool. Also it would be interesting to be able to turn each type of special tile on or off to create custom game modes. There could be a large bank of specials and you can pick any of them for the game. I have thought of making something like that before and I think it would work really well.Anyway those are my thoughts. Well done for your work on this game with some tweaks this will have a lot of replay value and it is fun Edit just a couple of ideas for how the tiles I said had no impact could be modified. The freeze tile could stop a tile moving at all for longer maybe  or  moves. The swap tile I am struggling to come up with something but maybe it could swap whatever tile is hits with a random tile that already exists. This should have some form of protection like the death tile probably does maybe it can only pick a tile  or less as the tile that gets swapped with whatever it hit or maybe that could increase as the high tile increases. Maybe for instance it can pick anything up to  of the high tile so for instance  if the highest is . This forces you to deal with higher and higher tiles moving as you advance similar to the bonus card mechanic spawning high tiles in Threes. The death tile could use a similar mechanic. Just an idea The x tile I honestly love the idea. However the fact that you can use it to repeatedly multiply the high tile removes all the games potential. It pains me to say that I would probably remove it if I were you although it is a great idea this is kinda an unfixable problem. Limiting it to lower tiles like the others is an option but you could still use it to skip difficult portions of the game.,2048,csm8wur,2,t5_30xgz
