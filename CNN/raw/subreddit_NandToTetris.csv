6077459,0,t3_3ypf9d,You could do away with the demultiplexers and send the output of the first multiplexers into bit not gates then send the not gate outputs along with the first multiplexer outputs to a second set of multiplexers with NXNY as their select bits. Additionally you could send the output of these multiplexers to both the adder and the bit and gate and have the outputs of these two be inputs to another multiplexer with F as its select bit. Splitting outputs like this lets you avoid the demultiplexer with NO as its select bit entirely leaving just the multiplexer.Also what software are you using?,NandToTetris,cyg8mep,1,t5_35wr2
