351548,0,t3_1y391f,Two thoughts.You already mentioned cameras were a no go. Why not ask one of the neighbors for permission? Explain to them the situation and it will be temporary. Explain to them exactly what youre doing so they feel comfortable with it.Its pretty easy to repurpose an old smart phone hook it up to a wireless network have it snap photos at regular intervals and upload them to Drop Box. You wont even have to visit the camera to get the data if you leave it plugged in. Second Thought.This requires some controlled lying and keeping stories accurate at all times but it can work. Have your sister construct a list of her closest friends that know the details described in the letters above first or second hand. Next make sure she speaks with them confides with them about how stressful all this is. She needs to sell this. The important part is to release some seemingly important details to each person but for each person the detail will be different. Youre going to need to come up with something juicy that the person will want to sharewrite about obviously it doesnt need to be true but your sister again needs to sell it.So how does that help? Keep track of the notes you receive. When you hear the detail that corresponds to the person she told it to you know where to start. Honestly this can be something very simple such as the color of a sweater blue for person x red for person y just so long as she makes it very relevant to the story. The person has to be compelled to repeat the details so you know the source. After that it shouldnt be hard. Best of luck to you.,RBI,cfh7enl,1,t5_2tayf

1689058,0,t1_cjrjvji,If you read the post and read between the lines it sounds as if OP is probably on the hunt for the breeding pair so they can obtain them or some of their not yet neutered offspring so they can breed these dogs themselves.It sounds as if the dogs they have obtained thus far have been adopted have been fixed and are not able to produce puppies.It would be nice to believe that OP loves this one type of dog soooo much that they want to make sure that none of them ever wind up as strays but Im old enough and jaded enough to believe otherwise.That said I suppose that there is nothing inherently wrong with noticing very desirable looks and temperament in related dogs and hoping to refine them into a new perhaps one day recognized breed. If no one had ever done this wed not have many of the breeds of dogs that we have today. I also understand why someone may not want to be  honest about wanting to obtain dogs in order to breed them. I understand why that might be especially unwise to admit that on reddit because redditors myself included strongly support pet adoption over pet purchase. My own wonderful pets are adopted rescues.Ive been in many threads where an OP is not treated very well in the comments because they purchased a dog instead of adopting one.I wish that those that purchase their pets would donate the same amount of money they paid for their dog to a shelter or a rescue group. That would make purchasing a pet while thousands of unwanted pets go to their deaths a tiny bit less horrific.,RBI,cjs2isz,1,t5_2tayf

2871437,0,t1_cnuhc3x,Part IIThe Left SideThis part of the observation begins around the time you exited your door .. At that same time .. a car is waiting to turn right. It is waiting for a person to cross. By .. the car turns and the walking person begins to appear on screen. Once this person finishes crossing the street he waits in The Spot. As this person waits the group of three mentioned earlier split up. Two of them turn around and walk past the guy standing in The Spot but they dont pass The Spot at exactly at the same time. The Spot Person appears to have interaction with the first person after which the first person picked up speed and crossed the street jaywalking. Then the second person passes the standing guy at The Spot .. and at the moment The Spots standing guy  walks slightly right. He stays still for approximately  seconds. At .. I see what I think is a head move against the light of your door and the person who had been standing still near The Spot now begins moving .. toward the person who passed your door. Coinciding with this actually two seconds prior at .. and .. a light flashes against a surface just under the  in the date stamp. At first I think its a car light but the next vehicle that drives by doesnt create the same light so I am making a note to watch that spot as more vehicles drive by. I already know that someone has a flashlight and I wonder if these people are signaling each other with light. At this point I watched this Flashlight Person more closely and wrote my observation above under The Right Side.Another shift in movement occurs beginning either with the light flash or the movement by your door so at .. or .. and now the overall movement is toward your door or that general area of the screen. The tone of the movement shifts also and by that I mean someone observing would notice odd behavior. At .. someone runs onto the screen from the right. This person has white or light shoes. This person runs between two cars and then begins walking. This person crosses the street and disappears from view. note check other video. I will call this person Weird Runner.Meanwhile the person who had been standing at The Spot is still walking toward the Flashlight Person.  .. Flash Light Person is standing under the  and the  in the  date stamp. In a few seconds this person moves as others approach this general area. .. The person who walked from The Spot now crosses under the  in the date stamp. .. to .. Under the date stamp three people move around. I think this is the Flashlight Person and the person who walked from The Spot.  As for the third person it could be either the head that appeared by your door at .. but in that case I never saw that person relocate so I lean toward thinking it was not this person or else the third person could be the person from earlier in the time code .. who crossed the street while the person in the white car was getting out of hisher car. I lean toward that but make a mental note to review the video looking just for that. Also I may not have located all the people involved so it could be yet another person. While these three people are together I cant tell if they switch positions. As this is happening Weird Runner moved off screen.The three people separate  one stays to the right with the flashlight and two walk left toward your door. They could have switched jobs I cant tell. .. Of the above two people one stopped near your door and the other kept walking coming to a stop at The Spot. The person at The Spot stood there for a while. Meanwhile the person near your door was not visible. Meanwhile I still have not located the person whose head I saw near your door at ..... Maybe I can see two heads moving in front of your door. This is in addition to the person who is walking to The Spot... The person walking to The Spot arrives. THEN.. Flashlight Person shines the flashlight against a surface.Over the next few seconds someone from the Flashlight spot walks all the way to the person at The Spot. At .. the walking person nears the end of the building and then passes the building. The person seems to pause at .. for a couple of seconds and then another person appears from the right note maybe this is more clear on the other video coming out of the blur at .. and then moving back into the blur.  I stared at that blurry spot ignoring the rest of the screen. Nothing more can be seen in this corner for the rest of the video.  I checked the other video and the time code jumps from .. to ...For a while I dont notice any movement. No cars drive by. I wonder if these people have blocked the road. .. The person at The Spot who has been standing still moves right. At this same time the first car in a while drives by. The person from The Spot walks to your door area and seems to stop there just as the video ends. I did not see any flashlight activity just prior to the .. movement.Rewatched and found thisNotice the vanlike vehicle parked to the side of the white car. It seems to be in a parking lot across a street to the right of the white car. Anyway at .. as people are getting out of the black car a light flashes in this vanlike vehicle.  The light doesnt repeat from traffic headlights. This is the same spot where later in the video the two people who crossed the street paused. I dont know if its a van btw.End of observation. See below for more notes.Thoughts I had as I went along and some guessesThis is timed perfectly. They knew exactly the minute you would appear. I wonder if they dressed in similar clothes to confuse you as to who is who.Both cars parked in a way to allow them to see your house.The white car parked by backing into the space. This would allow for observation and for a quicker exit. Also use what you know about the case to consider why the trunk was seemingly opened and closed. Not knowing any of the context I cant make smart guesses but in some contexts weapons could be a possibility. Or if people are coordinating efforts it could be a signal to someone else. The car lights turning off could have been a signal. Someone later has a flashlight and that is another way to signal people. Could the flashlight have come from the trunk? Once the people mix together I cant keep the people straight.The Spot Use what you know about the crime and location to consider if this spot could be a central communication spot. Is it easily visible? Is it a good lookout? Regarding my own bias when I looked at this you had already told me you had been a crime victim relating to someone in the video and the multiple people had been involved so I looked at this trying to see who appears to be interacting. I do not know if the crime happens while the video is running. I cant make out a crime but there are points when the activity seems to shift toward your door and away from your door and at times activity speeds up and slows down. I am guessing the crime happened just in front of your door. I lost track of a person there. Thats not a question for you its just part of my observation and you dont need to tell us.  The left side of the building my left is another spot thats difficult to track especially since the one video that shows that spot loses time in the time code jumps forward at places. The spot you referred to as your door appears to be a bright rectangle with some still dark shapes on it. Just to the left of that door so my left as I am looking at the screen is a dark linefigure. It stays in that spot throughout the video mostly still but sometimes the moves very slightly. I dont know if this is a person or an object but I make a mental note of it. .. to .. is an example.At .. that car with its lights on  I cant tell if its just waiting to turn which it did or if the driver had interaction with the flashlight person. In the black and white video I can see the person with the flashlight at .. and for the next few seconds but then the video jumps again and skips some time.I am trying to search for information about criminals using light to communicate just out of curiosity. If anyone finds creditable info please post. Editing Disclosures I did this in several sittings sometimes typing as I went along and sometimes in reflection and naturally my tenses shifted. Im not going to worry about cleaning that up.  Finally if it seems like I accidentally reversed left and right or reversed numbers ask me. I tried not to but I know my common errors. I do know right from left so if that happened Ill just fix it and update.  Im not going to sit on this until its all polished and pretty but I dont want to add to confusion either.

2960921,0,t3_2tw9xf,My wife and I are both involved with Pit bull rescue and I have heard reports of dog fighters who pose as solicitors so they can scope out your dog and security. If you arent home and the dog is outside they are known to open your gate and lead them to a van. Dog fighters want larger dogs. Puppies dont make good bait dogs. I would suggest asking around for any unusual solicitors. There is usually a pattern in a neighborhood with solicitation. For us we get door to door steaks ADT security and a lawn service. I would be suspect of any one off solicitor who doesnt have cards and a clear sales pitch. Any information you can gather will help with determining the next steps. I also recommend contacting a local pit bull rescue and ask about where the dog fighting hot spots are.

It would be a hell of a story either way. Busan Korea is a  week trip by boat and its one of the worlds busiest ports. Theres an American Consulate there and the ROK is very USfriendly so it may be a good option.Although I have lived in Korea Ive never entered a country without a passport so I dont know how that goes. I cant imagine its simple. I am unsure if Korea has an extradition treaty with Singapore or if youd even be eligible for such with a minor crime. There is probably no good reason to tell any foreign authorities about your fugitive status once you flee Singapore as their posture will doubtlessly be less hostile if youre just some backpacker whose passport was stolen. If I was in your position Id be open to going anywhere thats not Singapore.Good luck.EDIT I was mistaken about full time consulate presence in Busan its monthly onsite outreach from the Embassy in Seoul.

Likely someone whos normally medicated and stopped taking their medication resulting in the expected spiral into chaos that unfortunately accompanies many of these conditions. Ive seen similar stuff in the past where they have written down snippets of things they have seen and remembered but usually its just pieces and fragments of a whole. It is then regurgitated vocally on paper etc like this and to anyone whos not the person suffering it just is garbled nothingness. Its sort of like a coping mechanism where they try to piece together whatever fantasy their mind has created into something coherent but actually makes no sense as the imbalance thats going on in their head is making random rubbish seem to make sense to the person involved.,RBI,cyju56v,67,t5_2tayf

Furthermore if there were a law enforcement agency literally doing a mitm attack on you you would not detect it through looking at your IP or by using a geolocation service or detect it at all.If youre worried about it check the certificates youre being issued to ensure they come from a real certificate authority. There are browser plugins that do this for you.. However this is really just a preventive measure to take and wont actually detect a mitm attack. ,RBI,d026p6i,17,t5_2tayf

Mail it to a friend have them mail it back to you.  Send it to Korea and back whatever you like.  While thats going on set up the cameras and put it back under your car somewhere.  Leave the car parked at a new house for a few days.  Leave it alone dont go anywhere near it and let the cameras watch who comes to visit the car.  Then kill the battery  itll appear to be broken.Youre safe the owner is found and all it costs is stamps and cameras which Im sure you can borrow quite cheaply for a couple of days.

You can get so deep into these.  My best worst one was the woman in WA that was having computers TVs software etc sent to her house and she was sending them on to her fiance from Germany so he can build schools.

Unfortunately between the two of us and the results the searches have returned the plate may have possibly been lifted from another vehicle.

It could be a former colleague due to the fact that he refers to your wifes cousin as a PFC. If it isnt a terrible subject to bring up I might ask how he died. If it was an explosion of sorts this could be a letter from one of the survivors who suffered from trauma. In the second line he mentions his name which starts with C. My initial thought was that it was Corporal. But at the bottom of the letter he writes his first name and then his middle name that starts with C. The last word of the second line also doesnt resemble and of the names listed at the bottom on the last line which makes me think that the last word of the first line ISNT a name and is a part of the third line.
