The reason I say obvious is because when have you seen any hockey player even the biggest assholes in the league randomly high stick the opposing players goalie on a play like that where its about to be blown dead.

651546,0,t3_21l9nu,. I think MSL simply is putting to much pressure on himself and therfor not making it any easier on himself. I truley belive he can perform well but I certainly hope he scores sooner rather than later. He has also been shuffled around a few lines. I have only been a Rangers fan for about  years and correct me if I am wrong but alot of star players that come to the Rangers underperforme. Lets hope he gets one tonight.. The Rangers just need to play the way they have over the latest games. It certainly wouldnt hurt if the top lines started putting up better numbers. . If the top lines start producing consistently and the . line and Dmen  and by that I meen McD continue producing. I think the Rangers is going to be a very dangerous team indeed. LGR!

719112,0,t3_22cvph,Id be stunned if we made it considering how scary the Blues Bruins Ducks and Sharks look.I feel more than comfortable in goal with Hank considering how hes been the past two playoffs. Talbots been great too. With Mac back I also feel comfortable with the defense as long as they avoid the momentary lapses they are prone to.And I feel okay about our depth. The third line is about as good as you can ask a third line to be. The fourth line generally keeps play in favorable parts of the ice and out of unfavorable ones so I trust them.But we have Nash Richards and Marty guys who can be . PPG players when theyre on their game. But they arent and I dont expect them to be. Richards disappeared in the middle of December. Martys done pretty much nothing for us except waste ice time. And Nash looks like Gretzky one week and like Pyatt the next two. If they find their grooves then the Rangers are a complete team that has as good a chance as anyone. But if they have anything similar to their combined  goals and  assists in  combined games then a second round exit looks like our fate.,rangers,cgm0luz,1,t5_2rnpb

927834,0,t1_ch9qtqz,I honestly dont get why AV scratched Fast last round. He had great chemistry with Richie and Hags. I wouldnt mind seeing his return with Carbomb going back down with Moore and Boyler  although he has great chemistry on the rd line too.Stralman and Staal have been outstanding. Before the playoffs Id really written Stralman off and was ready to drop him for Diaz. Im glad hes picked up his game this much in the playoffs. Kleins icing can be problematic but I think hes been more defensively responsible than Mac and G as of late.,rangers,ch9qzss,2,t5_2rnpb

927980,0,t3_24qqc4,Sit Dorsett. Put in Miller Fast idgaf. Its redundant to have both of them out there against Pitt. Sit Moore. Put in Diaz. Whoever is working the powerplay needs to be fired. Its not AV. Its Scott. We had a good thing working for us in the beginning of the season but ever since after the Olympic break our PP hasnt done well. Now it flat out sucks. We can not win like this. Scott is crazy he keeps putting out the same PP lines with the same strategy and expects something to change. Spoiler Alert It wont. Change the PP to one that works and you win the series no question.  Girardi Mac get your shit together. Both have looked well whats a little better than awful? Especially for our st line D. Thats supposed to be our strong point and it hasnt. I actually hope that Mac is injured because some of his play has been un MacTruck like. Overall confidence is falling. Hank stood out everyone fell back. Probably our second worst game since the Olympic break although the score doesnt really do it justice. This was more like a  rout.   ,rangers,ch9rlbg,2,t5_2rnpb

935507,0,t3_24tw5w,It seems like all of the wheels are falling off at the same time. Nash still hasnt scored. Our PP is terrible and actually hurt our chances today Most of the players look tired. Passes arent hitting the tape and players are just skating past pucks etc. Not even a single goal in  minutes of ice time.  Is it the players? Is it Scott Arniels power play? Is it the entire coaching staff being unable to light a fucking fire under the players? They look like they are not desperate at all when trailing at the end of the game.

950812,0,t3_24zqi5,I said this in the rhockey thread and Im putting it here so I can hear what you guys have to say about it I honestly dont know what can fix this team when they get into these kind of slumps. New coach newish offensesuperstars in Nash and St. Louis the rise of Stepan we have a great D core on paperthe regular season anyway weve got great rd line grinders like Pouliot weve got skill guys in the middle   Zucc Hagelin Brassard Kreider. Honestly what is this team missing? Just something about the fucking sweaters these past few years. This is a really solid team on paper if nothing else. How can we improve? Get a Crosby Malkin Stamkos type guy? Well yeah thats true of any team. Theres just something missing and I have no idea what it is. The only thing I can think of is that teams like the Blackhawks and Bruins are more than just a collection of guys wearing the same jersey who like each other well enough theyre true fucking teams. But is that something you can create? Something you can sign draft trade for? Or is it something that just happens? The Penguins for example for all their skill are more like the Rangers in that respect than the Bruins or Hawks and it showed in the Bruins series last year and perhaps the Flyers series the year before even more so.,rangers,chcd5q0,8,t5_2rnpb

As a Pitt grad I can speak to how awesome a city Pittsburgh is. Its not New York far from it but thats part of why I loved it for  years at least not sure I wouldve wanted to live there my whole life. And if youre a Penguin youre a god in that city. I met Sidney Crosby at the Milkshake Factory on Carson Street Ive witnessed it firsthand. Im sure LA is pretty great as well but the Kings are doing fine. The Bruins etc. At the end of the day none of them is New York and theres definitely some truth to what youre saying but Im still not sure this is the answer or at least the whole answer. ,rangers,chcdl5x,1,t5_2rnpb

The NHL is a tight checking defensive league but Zucc is incredibly crafty with the way he skates and his body language that creates space for himself. Hes always moving and makes it hard for defenders to check him and is sneaky on rushes to give himself more space and time to pass. Love his vision and tenacity.

1095822,0,t3_26nyr3,Watched the game late cause I had to go out for my moms birthday so I missed out on the GDT. Here are some ran done thoughtsOur PK looked really good besides that first bullet from SubbanOut PP looked good despite the lack of shots. Our passing was crisp our puck movement was good we had some great looks and we really had them at our mercyFinally an embellishment callthe game tying goal on the resulting power play was gorgeous and soooooo satisfying Lindqvist was off I like the call to pull himTokarski really starting to look vulnerable. Weve figured out how to work him and draw him out of position fuck that tripping call against Poulliot. Still salty as fuck from that. disgusting hit from Moore. That has no place on ice. We cant stoop to their level but at least Diaz is a solid replacement. Kreider Step and Nash line looked the best it has perhaps all playoffs. Mac had a good game unlike the rest of our DNot pretty from Dorsett at the end of the game. A benching might be in order although with Carcillo out Im not sure who would replace him on the th line. Fuck the trash throwing. Fuck Subban. Fuck embellishmentFuck Duguays red jacket Other than that all Ive got to say is that its just one game. One really really weird game tonight. Knowing this team theyll put it behind them and regain their stride at MSG on Thursday. We only need one more! Lets go Rangers!!!,rangers,chsukxl,6,t5_2rnpb

1223095,0,t1_ci77g4y,He played poorly last playoffs too but he was very good once again during this past regular season IMO. He missed some time with a concussion which likely affected his game for a while even after his return but he still managed  goals. He was a . CF and a .CFRel which is solid especially since he faced the highest quality of competition on the team. Im not going to argue that his performance was up to that contract but theres maybe one or two players in the league who could live up to that contract. With the cap very likely going up too it wont be quite as bad. ,rangers,ci77t56,1,t5_2rnpb
1224013,0,t1_ci720do,I watched it a few times and it doesnt look like interference to me. There was digging with sticks and hank readjusted his body which opened up the slot for it to be poked through.Edit on second review there was contact with hank but as a result of a ranger pushing a king into another king who contacts hank. Rangers created the initial inertia.,rangers,ci7biv6,2,t5_2rnpb
1232212,0,t3_286y2u,Its especially tough when the team played their fucking hearts out like they did. Usually I wouldnt blast a close call that sets the kings up for the tying goal but that call was by far the worst of the playoffs and maybe that Ive ever seen. Shouldve been a no call or a call against the kings for the leg in that way or the stupid flop. Because this call was so bad and caused the rangers to lose their momentum I just cant let it go. I know for a fact we wouldve won if they didnt get that penalty and the series wouldve been very different. I dont even care if anyone sees me as a whiner or a complaining fan because I see it as showing heart and caring for your team when theyre put in an unfair situation. Even though its over its just still in my mind. I wont forget how resilient they were after being robbed left and right in the playoffs but this time it cost them big time. Its a damn shame that a call as big and retarded as that ultimately ended us. Well shut them up next year even though I know the calls will continue to be as baffling as that. ,rangers,ci88onx,0,t5_2rnpb

We also may resign Carcillo still and if we choose to do that theres no need for Prust. Even if we dont resign Carcillo Prusts contract is still .m.

2190740,0,t1_cli60st,Corsi refers to the percentage of shot attempts goals shots on goal that are stopped blocked shots and missed shots that occur in the offensive zone while a player is on the ice. It basically measures how well a players presence affects the teams possession time and the ratio of offensive chances to defensive breakdowns. Its somewhat controversial some people think its the most valuable stat some people think its totally useless. I think its somewhat useful but only with a much larger sample size than this. Since you have to account for strength of competition zone starts special teams linemates playstyle and what the situation in the game is e.g. garbage time in a  third period skews things among other things though some of these things can be accounted for to some extent there are obvious flaws.If you see Fenwick its the same thing it just removes blocked shots.Id say a good use of these advanced stats would be things likeStempniak has tremendous possession numbers and we got him for super cheap so hell likely be more worth it than people expect from his point totalsToronto has pretty poor overall possession numbers so once their shooting percentage regresses towards the mean theyre going to have a hard time.while a bad use of advanced stats would beNash is the worst player on the Rangers thus far this season because his corsi is shitty so hes not having a positive impact.Stralmans possession stats show hes better than McDonagh and Girardi so hes a top tier defenseman.,rangers,cliaouh,3,t5_2rnpb

I think getting a Lundqvist jersey is like getting a Jeter jersey as its obvious we all love Hank.I say white Krieder Although I am not a fan of getting white jerseys only because all of mine have some sort of beer or mustard stain. I live  minutes outside of Hartford and go to many WP games. If the Whale jersey wasnt so bad I would have bought Krieds in the green.When the Wolfpack first came to Hartford I brought  cash with me to all the games waiting for them to sell jerseys. Struck gold when they sold a limited amount of actual on ice jerseys. And it was only  fishnagles. It is white and yeah the first game my wife handed my a Coffee Coolata in the car didnt wait for me to fully grab it and well yeah.

If youve come to the conclusion that hes going to keep playing because AV is stubborn wouldnt you root for him to do better? You people just want to whine whine whine whine whine.

Talbot whos is the much better puck handler had already made costly mistakes handling the puck in a much shorter time sample. On to your next point about not needing goalies to play lights out... If quick doesnt play the way he played we are holding the cup period. If Hank didnt play the way he played we wouldnt have even made it to the SCF. You dont need the best goalie.

McD at age  counts .m against the cap hit until  while Girardi  years old than McD at  with declining stats  is locked up until  .m against the cap hit ignoring the fact Mcd is better. He has a NTCNMC forget which making it extremely difficult to move him in the future. Do I appreciate Girardi? Sure Id love for him to remain with the Rangers.

The amount of times it was gaveway away negates the positive impact he has. Too many times he tries to make the pass instead of just stopping the puck for the dman in the zone to get.    He also holds it too long. You are allowing the opposing team to get deep in the zone and set up. Makes it immensely more difficult to break out since the other team is right on top of them. ,rangers,cpywvlh,3,t5_2rnpb

4129395,0,t1_crqn94a,For me I dont necessarily hate the team. Rather its just some interactions with fans that I cant deal with and unfortunately it translates over to the team at times mind you this isnt strictly Tampa and can be said for many others. It sucks because it can make it difficult for you to be happy for your favourite players on other teams. Theres just been a lot of vitriol between the two of us given the players that have been swapped around. I realize a lot of hate is directed moreso to the players than us but...I dunno. When they talk that much shit about themyour club its hard not to feel a bit weird about it at times. And then when the opposing team succeeds in some way I feel like it ends up giving them even more leverage which some people kind of go overboard with. I mean I realize that chirpsshittalking is to be expected but sometimes I feel like theres a line a lot of people cross. ,rangers,crqz41h,1,t5_2rnpb

And despite the heavy sadness of the last few seasons in the playoffs it feels good to know that Hank has been standing on his head each time.  You cant learn or be taught to be consistently vital on a team you earn that.  Hank deserves this salary because its less about what the number is and more about an economical statement of his importance to us.  His value and character are bled through each night he puts on the jersey.  That salary is an appreciation of what he brings to our organization and establishes our concrete faith in his abilities.

4287013,0,t1_cs8uchx,Yup.Based on the way Talbot handled Hanks injury I expect that hed perform very well as the man. Sure theres some risk in that but Im pretty confident that hes less of a headcase than many of the other goalies out there.I dont see Hank with the impeccable reputation that many in this sub do. He tilts very hard in big games when facing adversity. He choked in the ECF against the Devils. But yes hes still a great goaltender.It bothers me that people equate Hank with the entire team. I was a fan long before he was our goalie and I will be long after. If dealing him wins us a cup Im all for it.

5218761,0,t1_cvex4t8,Mikko Koskinen  years old amp Ilya Ejov  years old are the two goalies for St. Petersburg in the KHL. Theyre combining for a . save percentage so theyre clearly not terrible. I think it has more to do with Shesterkin being able to go to the minors because of his age as opposed to the other two thats the culprit. Akin to Anaheim having Gibson play this season in the AHL while AndersenKhudobin are on the big club. More a matter of contracts than anything else. Also as a side note Shesterkin is literally  hours too old to play in the upcoming World Juniors Championship so its not like hes expected to play elsewhere this season which wouldve been a much better reason for him not being configured to play KHL minutes this season.,rangers,cvf1wxn,1,t5_2rnpb

5606297,0,t3_3rw5qw,Dan Girardi is bad by every metric imaginable. I pay for my season tickets every year and I can complain about whoever the fuck I want.This isnt a situation like Rick Nash where someone is playing well but isnt producing because hes unlucky. Girardi is awful.His contract is likely going to lead to us losing Keith Yandle in the offseason who by every measure is our best puckmover one who we traded a significant amount for. Loyalty means nothing in this sport. Players who had a hard road to the pros are no different then the number  overall draft pick on his second RFA deal. I would argue against that whole cornerstone thing because I think its asinine but everyone has a right to their opinion. Being emotionally attached to a player doesnt make him any better.The Rangers also give up half a fucking goal more with him on the ice then now the second worst is Dan Boyle who is still far below where Girardi is on that stat. So there goes the shutdown defenseman thing that people like to use.Girardi should be a third pairing defenseman on the second PK at best and should under no circumstance play against guys like Crosby Ovechkin and Tavares. And until that day comes you will not see then end of this complaining because it is absolutely valid.This whole list is incredibly pretentious we dont have to love someone blindly because of the jersey they wear. The team could actually be better then it is which is not great atm slow start masked by Lundqvist being a fucking God if Girardi played fifteenseventeen minutes a night or not at all.

It seems hes playing in Boyles place because if he were to play at NHL level  years after being drafted would be the time.... Thats why hes getting more time.

5912319,0,t3_3w9vpp,Do not buy from them. Youre just going to end up with a fake. I mean if youre going to buy a knockoff jersey at least buy it from a slightly more legit site eg. Aliexpress is the most common. If youre looking for some cheaper alternatives Someone wrote this up and I kept it but I always thought it was pretty useful. Basically you should never have to pay full price for a jersey and I do think thats true. Its unfortunate that most sales will come after the holidays but take a look around. I remember last year some sites cleared a lot of their inventory for quite cheap right after Christmas or had New Years sales. Regardless of what you end up doing make sure you order sooner than later otherwise the jersey will arrive late or you have to pay extra for quick shipping. If it ends up arriving after Christmas though you could look into waiting for the sales. ,rangers,cxumymy,2,t5_2rnpb

7407656,0,t1_d2k6mc4,Haha dont worry! The reason their grades are higher are because they played their respective roles better IMO then E. Staal did. Eric was brought in as another power forward and a compliment to the defensive system that AV has as well as someone who can score goals and is a locker room leader something AV has an infatuation with lol and Im not sure whether or not he was a locker room leader but  points is just not up to snuff. Stoll won DZ faceoffs and was a good rdth liner. Marc Staal as you said yourself had some rare instances of showing his old shut down self and yes he did have a bad year but we didnt trade away anything for him and he wasnt brought it to be the thing that gets the Rangers the cup. Everyones gonna hate me but I actually think Glass played alright this year. Obviously hes not the next Ovi but he did his job he scored goals quadrupled his total from last year?!? was physical when he had to be was a good forechecker and he played well with Moore and Stalberg. Megna is an interesting case because he was a very forgettable player besides his  point night in his first game as a NYR and he didnt play many games so its hard to give a full grade. But one thing to noteremember is that these grades shouldnt be compared to one another its purely based off of how that person played in my eyes and if they did their job,rangers,d2k7afv,2,t5_2rnpb

9631099,0,t1_d9zhly0, They need better masseuses.  Gotta love forward depth!! It was the biggest problem coming into this year especially since we lost  defensemen who could move the puck. Majority of our games have had forwards do that but it was about time that our defense got exposed for not having that ability. i also blame AV for not using Clendo esp since he is the best at generating offense by moving the damn puck. Holden Klein Staal Girardi arent gonna get it done and you saw that a bit in the season expect to see it again but as long as our forwards show up every night i think it wont be severe when it happens but it wont be pretty.  yeah i think they feel comfortable with the lead enough to not give a shit about shots against...an interesting thing but this offense can score at will when given the right opportunity. G has been good but he still should be on top pair especially defending against McDavids line you saw that their only goal and when we got trapped. Grabs is awesome he wont sustain that play but its nice to see he can be lethal.LGR,rangers,da08bkf,1,t5_2rnpb

He kinda almost always has a nice move and then fucks it up but he plays hard and physical.I thought smith sucked in the beginning then looked kinda awesome. Nice to have a guy who can skate and seems like hes physical too. that hit in the third after he was down on the ice was awesome.

11216916,0,t3_600ok7,They looked better amid several strong stretches during the season. And before the new year they almost never blew games they should win games they had late leads in games that were tied or they were down a goal but clearly the better team. They won those games the vast majority of the time in the first half. They still have great talent and there are flashes but either your eye test is broken or youre just reading stat lines if you think this team looks as good now as they did earlier in the season. They get hemmed and trapped in their own zone SO MUCH MORE. The passes to nowhere are all over the place now. They get outworked and often look like the less hungry team. They struggle to maintain a consistent compete level. A good third period comes after an invisible first period where theyre outshot by a dozen or more. A great start is followed by the inevitable full period dip that lets the other team back in the game where the door should have been outright shut on them.   Theyve had a very good regular season overall and if they can regain their earlier swagger  they will be a playoff dark horse. But if anyone thinks the team that took the ice last night and couldnt put the killing blow on Florida up  actually looks like a team that can get out of the first round no matter the matchup  theres no point in holding civil rational debate because that person wont listen to reason.  You may disagree with me  but a Carolina team this mired in catastrophe and a Tampa team so depleted of their opening day roster skill are two games they absolutely should have dominated.

Thing with Hayes is I do like him at C and we all know that MillerHayesGrabner line can turn on the magic. So I dunno. But I feel like Buch on the fourth doesnt make sense either especially after watching last game. All and all Im just happy we have this kind of healthy offensive depth right now. The goalies in this series will probably be a wash both will be amazing. However our Bottom  could be the difference that means getting to Price more than they get to Hank.
