2233691,0,t3_2kozme,Mine is a working Heeler so the idea of  foot tall humans running around and making fast movements and high pitched noises was a little frightening for her at first my cousin has a  year old son and we go over for family dinner. Instinct kicked in and she tried to herd them into the house which she successfully managed. Its just a matter of teaching the kids to be respectful around the dog and to approach it and handle it carefully. Innately Heelers are protective and will eventually understand that they are not just any kids but their kids now.,AustralianCattleDog,clnr7zk,2,t5_2t5ou
2239246,0,t3_2kribp,I adopted my blue heeler from a shelter almost a year ago when he was  months old. It took some work because he is a little stubborn but after an obedience class and hours of working together he does really well. Mine is super intelligent and sometimes maybe to smart for his own good lol. Also when people say they will take a bullet for you they arent kidding. I have a GSDpit mix and my little blue heeler will jump to protect me from any perceived threat before my GSD mix well. This is why socialization is extremely important with this breed. Also I would suggest positive reinforcement. This breed is known to be nippy and respond better to kindness versus anger. Good luck! ,AustralianCattleDog,clogmp4,1,t5_2t5ou

3020865,0,t1_cob1fvw,Find the treats was super easy! I started out with a super yummy treat and I showed my dog he was on a sit stay as I put it under a cup on the floor. I then told him Find it! and since he saw where I put it he ran over and tipped the cup and found the treat. Praise repeat the practice. After a few times with the cup I move up to under the edge of the couch. Then the window sill then the chair. All easy finds all while he watches me hide the treat. Once he gets it we put him on a sit stay in the other room go in and hide the treats in those places he had already found treats and  let him loose and it just evolves from there. The only thing my boys need as far as guidance is to know which room to look in after that they have their noses to the ground looking for treats. Cheese works really well for that lesson!Speak When they start to bark preferably at you so you already have their attention say Speak and then praise. Every time they bark give the command and then praise. It can be incredibly annoying as my boy was a barking fool when he was younger and I felt like all we were doing was Speaking But eventually it clicks. Quiet is much more difficult but you have to teach Speak first. Ask for Speak and then once they stop give your Quiet command and praise. There is a bit of a cheat on this for the dogs though. With my boy hed stop barking for the Quiet command get his treat and then start barking his head off thinking I was going to give him a Quiet command and then praise again. So I ONLY worked the Quiet Command after giving the Speak command if that makes sense. Once its reliable in that situation I was able to use it if he was just barking at the window or whatever. He is not  reliable when out in the yard or when really worked up but in the house just barking at the neighbors cat and what not hes great.I hope that helps. Its hard to explain on paper and Im not a dog trainer just someone who has worked with a lot of dogs so Im sure there are a ton of better ways to do it. ,AustralianCattleDog,cob3z2d,5,t5_2t5ou

3056274,0,t1_coe6slz,I run my guy .yo BCHeeler mix with a bike but I also taught him to ride in a trailer.  This way if I see anything change in gait or he seems to show fatigue or if hes just being a punk he rides in the trailer.  If were doing errands I may cover ten or more miles but he runstrots between three and five of that.  This gives me a back up in case of trouble and maybe that might be a useful idea to you.  Maybe most important is that when the dog is running he sets the pace.  I know that sounds funny but its very easy to miss fatigue or gait abnormalities if your attention wanders.  Examine his pads after every exercise.  Carry plenty of water and a bowl.  Im apologize if this seems obvious but I like to get it all out in the open.  I have a dog who gets excited every time I grab the bike and set up the Burley and I want to keep it great.

Breeders will sometimes have dogs that despite great health checks will be deaf in one ear. If you are just looking for a companion youll never even know but it could cause issues in someone looking for a working dog so possibly you could get one of those pups from a breeder or an older returned dog etc if you dont have the ability to get home at lunch for the pup.

8730514,0,t3_4zly8c,You are their one and only to an obsessive and often annoying degree. Going to the bathroom? I want to be in there. Leaving me alone for  hours? Fine Ill entertain myself... on the kitchen countertops. Mine destroyed my wood backyard gate opened my neighbors gate went through their back pantry and scratched on their back door just to find me while I was having a beer next door. I couldnt be mad at him... he was so proud of himself and excited to see me.Id make sure to socialize them as much as possible because they can be very protective of you. They are always alert and very physical dogs. On the flipside if you can deal with all of that its worth it. They are super smart and very fun particularly for running hiking swimming fishing etc.,AustralianCattleDog,d6wyjm9,8,t5_2t5ou

8865768,0,t3_51ocz2,We crate until our dogs are potty trained and then leave them free in the house for small amounts of time and slowly increase the time until its a full work day. I get why people prefer the crate when gone but if its a full day  days a week I know I wouldnt want to be locked in crate for  hours... We put a lot of focus on them when we are home and make sure we wear them out and they dont chew things they shouldnt or potty in the house so it works for us but if that wasnt the case we would crate them. With that being said I think it you REALLY want him crated a lot of people sucessfully do it it just means you will have to give lots and lots of exercise morning and night and it can work. You can give safe mentally stimulating things in a kennel but I found that mine didnt really play in the kennel.,AustralianCattleDog,d7djhbm,1,t5_2t5ou

10887351,0,t3_5vl77c,My ACD goes out for about  minutes per day to run as much as he wants plus daycare once a week. They are much more active when they are younger but do settle down. This doesnt mean he cant go all day if needed.Mine is very clingy. I got a second dog when he was a year and a half and he gets jealous if the other dog gets attention. Not aggressive but tries to steal my attention from her. No cats for me so no clue.They can be very vocal but it depends. Mine will always bark when the front door opens no matter what. When playing they can bark quite a bit too. Outside of that I dont really have any whining or any other noise.They are great dogs and I wouldnt get any other kind. My second is a half heeler but she is a rescue and has some serious anxiety issues so I dont really classify her as a normal heeler. My purebred is  now and an amazing companion.,AustralianCattleDog,de2yb0i,4,t5_2t5ou

11113435,0,t1_dernndc,This was at our local dog park after a run on the trails. However Max does backyard agility with me... been thinking about getting him into a class now that hes older. As for Mika shes getting there. Shes a crazy good jumper. She jumps into our trees if she sees something interesting. Shes starting to warm up to going through tunnels now but she can be a little skittish....so one step at a time. Lol. Max also does some dock jumping nothing official though. Mika is finally starting to swim so maybe shell be dock jumping by the end of the summer. Shes almost more of a daredevil than Max with some things. ,AustralianCattleDog,derp5nl,1,t5_2t5ou
11190564,0,t1_df08nze,Thanks for your reply. Seems like for any dog its a roll of the dice when it comes to certain traits. Any dog we adopt we want to try and socialize as much as possible. Our cats are pretty easy going but spoiled af. Its going to be a bit of an adjustment for them but Im sure they can deal. I know training mental and physical excersize limits aggression and anxiety. Im super excited for training our future pup thats one of the reasons why we are so drawn to ACD s because of their intelligence. Also because theyre gorgeous dogs but it would be pretty silly of us to to make that decision simply on appearance.,AustralianCattleDog,df0fr1v,1,t5_2t5ou
11221550,0,t3_604cct,As has been said these pups are smart and will quickly figure out how to maximize the treats. But also little puppies dont have a good feel for their systems quite yet. Having them go separately like this might actually help you to train them to go on command.  Being able to tell you adult dog to poop because you know they wont be back outside for a while is very helpful.  ,AustralianCattleDog,df3y5vf,3,t5_2t5ou

11640958,0,t3_663nd0,YES. The most I have ever seen a dog drink water. The first time I met my ACD I adopted him he drank almost a full bowl of water and I was amazed. Anytime he is even the slightest bit hot he downs an entire bowl. He will lay by his bowl and drink until it is empty. ,AustralianCattleDog,dgfil63,5,t5_2t5ou
