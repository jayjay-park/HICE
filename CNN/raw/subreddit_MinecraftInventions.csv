71483,0,t1_cemj1wi,you could make a setup to where you use another item and have it trigger a command to kill all golems and give you another pokeball.,MinecraftInventions,cemkfjm,2,t5_2s5j6
280754,0,t1_cf9upm0,Just a way to do it differently. Its easy to make a generic redstone clock clock etc... but I like doing things like this. The pumping pistons almost gives it a steampunkesque feel to it ,MinecraftInventions,cf9v2wu,2,t5_2s5j6
421619,0,t3_1ywtdm,Really cool video as usual. Although theres one little drawback  You really have to make absolutely sure that theres a single possible solution because itll only work with the one you built.Edit  Found a level with multiple solutions  Imgur spoilers sort of,MinecraftInventions,cfogsl3,1,t5_2s5j6

2078522,0,t1_cl3pk38,Yea possibly. I had to kill the mobs at spawn and replace the grass with stone at spawn and around the farm but like I said it is just a proof of concept. Probably not worth building in survival unless you do not want to travel to find new mobs.,MinecraftInventions,cl40xhg,1,t5_2s5j6

3245764,0,t1_covir0c,Sorry Tonkow I dont have a video setup. Ill need another week to finish the long range system and then Ill post a world download with the prototype short range and the new one.

4282118,0,t1_cs85ihr,Perhaps it was placing the string thats given me trouble in the past. A good solution is to place a line of ice blocks at the water level then put the string on top of that then melt the ice.,MinecraftInventions,cs8bax1,2,t5_2s5j6
4282963,0,t3_39czw2,Very cool idea!Id love to see an automated version of this. If you have to fill it manually you probably lose more time doing that than you gain but in an automated system this could be a huge improvement.Getting all the timings right is going to be a real challenge.,MinecraftInventions,cs8eqvt,1,t5_2s5j6

7238409,0,t1_d20x9pc,nobody that posts here is making money of it or maybe technically a few cents from youtube if they monetized it what  dont because its insignificant anyway.Most of the people just want to share their ideas and some of them think they can do it better with a video than with a picture.You can also save a link or a video to your computer.Im fine with your policy just wanted to correct you about that.

8684840,0,t1_d6r6n71,You wanted feedback and I provided. No it does not work the fact that the bottom piston gets stuck and you have to press a button to fix it is not a feature its called a broken design. Also something I just noticed why are you using sticky pistons? That completely baffles me. I wont bring you or your future daughter into this as this should be an argument about your terrible design and video and not about my judgement of your character. But it seems that you took it to that level. Also I recognize no indication in my previous post of me getting angry. Just because a person says fucking does not mean that they are angry. However now I am slightly perturbed due to your mindless response and your lack for criticism. I sincerely have concerns for you and I am glad that you have found peace in the practice of primitive minded acts such as that of praying. Also as a christian yourself dont you think calling me a miserable human being is a bit harsh? What happened to peace and love?,MinecraftInventions,d6r8bv8,0,t5_2s5j6

9637571,0,t3_5cy92j,The usual point of using dropperbased BUDs is that they can be silent before Observer blocks. Using a piston in your build makes that pointless.,MinecraftInventions,da112ff,1,t5_2s5j6
