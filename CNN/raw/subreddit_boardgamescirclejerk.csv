9911269,0,t1_day1e8m,You know this is exactly why I have a boilerplate Board Game Player Covenant I have all participants sign before we typically play these types of deception games. Otherwise you can really go after people and theres not much written in the rulebook you can fall back on.A typical covenant should cover what players expect inside the game outside the game during snackmaking and bathroomrelieving activities and other gray areas. But I do have one other important note about violence outside of the game. Under enough duress anyone will confess to being a spy and theres been more than one game Ive personally witnessed where a player has confessed to being a spy in order to escape immediate discomfort only to end up NOT being a spy.And remember players and NOT allowed to reveal their cards this is described in the rules. No amount of torture should be permitted in this case.Revealing your card to firmly establish spy status is a irrecoverable game state. As the owner of the game you are allowed to declare yourself the winner. And ban violators from ever darkening your doorstep again.,boardgamescirclejerk,dazgmc9,1,t5_2u1y3
