198421,0,t3_1wcj07,Beating a scout in an even fight is very hard unless theyre awful. The best way to beat them is to is either not fight them at all Ive watched a fair share of invite roamer demos and more often than not they just jump away from scouts or by beating them with positioning if theyre the DMalldaybutdumbasabrick type majority of scout mains tbh. What I mean with positioning is doing things like baiting them around a corner where their movement is limited and prefiring the corner or baiting them into a small room where you have the advantage. Sometimes you can also jump on their heads for an easy kill when theyre distracted but never jump at them when theyre looking at you.  Ive actually had scouts repeatedly rush me in a small room die because theres no room to dodge then complain about the soldier class. ,truetf2,cf11jep,6,t5_2stfn

Not saying its even with heavy but a very good second to it. Plus its easier to chase down uber as pyro. I feel like scout misses the ability to control an enemies movement. Sure it has more killing potential but if a soldier bombs you can make sure the bomb isnt successful rather then making it easier to kill him in the long run.

350673,0,t3_1y3shx,Sounds to me like youre attributing an average to single shots. When firing three rockets theyll psuedorandomly pick three spots within that three degree deviation. If its truly random then having more rockets fire in quick succession will lead one to believe that theyre more accurate because the average of the three will be closer to the center than the average of well just one rocket. In addition having a larger sample size of three rather than the minimum one would also cause bias given that the chance of one of the rockets being more accurate is higher with the larger sample size.To truly test it youd need to have an extremely large sample size of rockets but one where you fire the exact same number of rockets total between firing one at a time and the burst shot. Record something like  rockets in burst mode and  in single shot mode with their exact location on a circular graph. If that confirms it then its a bug Valve will have to address in some manner. If it shows that its as random as it will get then it was just bias on your part.,truetf2,cfh45bo,7,t5_2stfn

462087,0,t3_1za24o,Of all the gimmics in s that I think are absolutely stupid  this is one that I think can actually be viable.  If you are good with the cannon you can put out the same damage as a regular demoman.  Several high level demos have shown to be able to put out enormous damage with the cannon alone.Also when a pick is needed you can charge in with a turn script  controller and get an easy med pick or force.  I would like to see how this works for your team during the season.  It will require your team to play very differently but I think it is somewhat of a nifty idea.

Honestly one of the closest longest and most fun games Ive ever had.First round we started defending got pushed back to last in ish minutes.  Managed to hold it for  minutes and they never capped. We capped last so .Next round was pretty equal and we were stuck on our last with about min left when they completely surprised us with a kritz play. Shame on us for not checking but we got destroyed and they capped. .Final round they got a time of about  minutes and we had to push with probably  minutes left. Intense as fuck. We built went a main push of all things ended up getting sentry getting kills and captured it with great plays by our entire team. .  hours.  fucking hours of this map.I hate Borneo.Incredibly GG to The Chafing.

668932,0,t3_21sc6d,Most people in MGE arent really interested in realistic soldier duels. I feel like  of them come down to close quarters trading where both soldiers die or one lands two directs and the other  take place in wide open areas where both soldiers end up chain counterjumping and controlling health packs with gunboats on. I think MGE teaches a lot of really awful habits because you have to play in suboptimal ways just to practice one specific part of your overall game and the vast majority of players never bother correcting themselves when playing in real games. I played in DM mod to try and avoid this although that comes with its own problems soldiers camping high ground like its MGE scouts running away to slowly chip enemies over  scatters etc but those problems are choices actively made by the players which simultaneously hamper their practice whereas in MGE you have to choose to play suboptimally in order to practice unless you want  of the playerbase raging at you. This isnt even including the other benefits to DM mod like learning how to fight in chaotic situations or how to fight multiple people at a time environmenthealth pack usage rocket jump routes etc. Lets not pretend either like airshots are particularly a super high valued skill among soldiers outside of frag vids if you can juggle someone and land the easy knock up directs and airshot scouts when theyre double jumping around youre good to go. The amount of times Ive seen soldiers flop around due to lack of experience in openended situations is x higher than the amount of times Ive seen a clutch airshot do anything notable and the general mentality of counterjumping is easy lol is almost as hilarious as people complaining about prefiring to me.,truetf2,cggb1w4,7,t5_2stfn

Also compared to UGC both CEVO and ESEA have stricter item whitelists that ban the gimmicky skillremoving items from play.So there is personal preference.

Both of these tools put you in a position where youre always fighting and youll get better at clicking on people since youre doing it more often than in a scrim where you have a couple of fights and a lot of ubers and stalemating. So youll improve your dm but you still need to work on playing smart or gamesense. So you should watch your demos watch better players demos and just see where youre missing out on dmg picks and good opportunities.

You hold a  degree maximum field if view if I recall correctly. This means that s of the world at any given time isnt on your screen. Only s of what cant be seen can kill you instantly with a backstab. On top of that the skill floor for stabs is the basic range of the knife and the arc in which a backstab is possible. The skill ceiling has not yet been met for any class in this game but the ability of spies to input their own abilities to land stabs and kills on players would be diminished greatly.Youd be taking a class thats already reliant on the enemy team screwing up in order to punish them trickstabs are no exception to this. and further reducing its abilities by providing a buffer for everyone elses mistakes.

1604870,0,t3_2cnaj6, start with s games. They are easier to cast and more popular to watch. you need an incredible amount of knownledge about comp tf to cast. If I show you any big teamfight youd have to explain to me why it failed or why it succeeded. Same with why a team loseswins a complete game. You need to spot some very subtle differences to have a good explanation. Its very hard I will not lie. Just reading out the killfeed will give you no views. Most casters have played comp themselves at a fairly high level. What is your comp experience? be enthusiastic about the game and big plays from indiviudals airshots making a med drop getting a  or k etc. If you are not excited about the game and cant convey that excitement to the viewer they wont be excited about your cast either. Cbear is probably the best example of this.

1612285,0,t3_2cqzxm, Reckless aggression as TMP said Try out different loadouts. I dont really like using the default flamethrower but it can be good practice since it forces you to rely on your primary more and get used to aim flares on a different timing backburner is pretty fun to actually get back burns with phlog if you just want people to rage. But more important is the secondaries. I like flare the most too but improving with the shotgun is also very important and you can muck around with the detonator and scorch shot for lulz. As for melee definitely try the powerjack more. The axe isnt all that good these days. the rest is just play more really. Reflects are more about prediction than raw reflexes most of the time since soldiers rarely spam longdistance rockets at you flareshotgun aim comes with time and spy sense comes from knowing where they come from and how they use disguises which you probably know from playing spy already. You can try to play pyro in tfcenter but its a bit more boring youre kinda forced to be more passive or youll die a lot and hear cries of PYRO SPYCHECK in mumble.

In csgo valve pushed an Ok map overpass and a god awful map cobble in a major k tourny a month before. What if valve made a tf international? I bet they would have their own map pool and their own whitelists. If they added a comp option in game every pub player in the universe would flood it. The silver pit would carry over to tf.

Even without understanding the deep meta behind some action or other the fact that there is action going on attracts the attention and casters have the important ability to turn the noise and excitement into something legible to their audience. Usually I find that they assume  sometimes out loud  that there are a few novices listening in who are not the majority of the audience but who are present anyway.

Having played on the map many times before will help you infinitely because youll be not only know all the areas and routes to take but youll have a level of prediction.

In that case definitely having a reliable hold on a strong area in a map that snowballs really rapidly is a very important factor.The second is a little more subtle and it isnt done nearly as often but Ill use two examples for it.On Viaduct when you own the point your respawn time is doubled. It will double the times of people who are currently dead. Assuming both teams wipe while youre trying to cap it can actually be a bad move to have your last player instantly cap. Generally this wont happen but you want the spawns in your favor as much as possible so you can get a harder hold and an uberkritz advantage. But it can be a better idea to delay your cap slightly so your guys can respawn first.The second comes down to construction of spawns. This is most evident on Upward. Upwards spawns are pretty close to the caps that push them forward past  and they each have  door. If you just baaarely cap against a team who shows signs of aggression they can and sometimes will just choose to spawncamp. And its easy as hell if you dont bust their combo or defense on  or  when you cap those points to spawncamp the enemy for a long time. Both spawns are singledoor. s spawn is in a spam haven and s spawn offers easy retreat for spawn campers. In said case you can actually completely screw up your overall  point time because you rushed too fast on the first  points and ended up busting your momentum and got spawncamped hard for like  minutes straight.But yeah due to the timer? Nah there isnt much of a reason in order to change around that stopwatch timer.,truetf2,cmgf4kq,14,t5_2stfn

2530448,0,t3_2on30a,Ignoring their respective gimmicks the Soda Popper is the better option mostly due to the fast reload. You cant be continuously aggressive with the FaN and despite its marginally higher damage per shot its overall damage output is lower than both the Soda Popper and regular Scattergun. If you do plan on using the ForceaNature youll definitely want to pack one of the pistols.Now to compare their gimmicks. I would say the ForceaNature wins here by a small margin simply because the mobility it provides isnt restricted by a rage meter. You can force jump whenever you have a shot or two loaded and the force jump can take you much higher further or faster downward than many people realise. Thats not to say that the Soda Poppers gimmick isnt useful because it can be insanely useful at times. Its just not as reliable because the off period is much longer.The Soda Popper is the better option.,truetf2,cmov6on,6,t5_2stfn

3005120,0,t1_co98h3o,I feel that the main problem people have with class bans is that theyre inconsistent which is not what people want to see in a structured organized gametype.LoL can get away with banning different heros because regardless of whoever they ban there are still an abundance of other choices which can accomplish the same thing in a relatively similar fashion. Even a team decides to completely switch up their character roster the other team knows that theyre going to have an assassin class a damage class etc. and dont need to adjust their playstyle beyond maybe one or two trump cards available to a different hero. In addition once a League player chooses a certain class theyre stuck like that for the rest of the game.You cant do that in TF because the selection is too limited you can change classes on the fly without consequence and even minor changes make massive fucking changes to how a team needs to respond. Itll either turn games from a contest of positioning knowledge DM and map awareness into oh shit they have class X using weapon Y now we have to get player Z to change to class Q or itll devolve into a cookiecutter playset due to the same classes being banned each game. If nothing else changes people will either hate comp AR because of how inconsistent it is or theyll start playing s instead.I agree with you in that a lot of people are probably being overlycritical of AR but I dont think that any further testing is needed. People dont take the format seriously because the way the rules are set up sucks not the other way around. Dont forget that s was also considered a joke when it first started but people found out while dicking around that its still a solid format to play even though it lacks the depth of s and HL.,truetf2,co9h8rp,1,t5_2stfn

3159225,0,t1_cooqbis,Im just going to write down a bunch of thoughts that this thread made me remember.gtSure you can say ad hominem fallacy but the fact is someone who is better at the game than you is going to know more about getting good you wouldnt say a McDonalds employee is just as valid as a heart surgeon if you need a quad bypass.Someone more skilled than you is more likely to know more about how to improve and realistically he does know more but in any serious discussion on how to improve theyd still have to specifically address the arguments youve made rather than dismiss your opinion because youre worse than them.And yes the surgeon is more valid but youre talking about skill in performing a task. In a discussion about how to best perform heart surgery the specific arguments and points of view brought up by the McDonalds employee can not be dismissed by saying hes less experienced skilled or knowledgeable. You actually have to specifically address whatever hes saying with his inexperience lack of skill and ignorance merely being the reasons as to why he has probably arrived at false opinions.Those are two different but intertwined things and it seems that a somewhat large portion of the comp TF community has misunderstood what they mean when it comes to discussions and its really really frustrating to attempt to bring up what you see as problems with conventional ways of thinking of and approaching the game and improving when youre not a bnny or a clockwork or whatever.Also it isnt just frustrating to see people not know how to discuss different points of view as it makes the less skilled and newer players less likely to explore whatever ideas they have about the game they play because they either think they cant do that effectively or because they can actually be derided for them if they post them thats less of a problem in truetf though and that leads to slower evolution in how people practice in more and more efficient and effective ways how to correctly think about gear etc. which is obviously harmful to a community.Im not gonna comment on the discussion on monitors but since you brought up Vhalins guide to aiming Ill use it as an example of what Im trying to say here.Regarding the section on choosing a sensitivity hes right in that a sens that works for someone else doesnt necessarily work for you but overall his approach isnt right imo.If he means physical comfort then I disagree with that being used as the main thing to base your sens on as you can get comfortable with new sensitivitiesways of moving your body.If he means mental comfortfeeling that whatever sensitivity you chose isnt hindering the developmentskill ceiling of your aim then Id disagree with that as well as I think those impressions people have when evaluating a sens arent necessarily true and that it isnt enough when trying to figure out how your aim might develop later on.Its the typical preference and comfort angle which fails to take into account important points about sensitivities and people such as that the higher the sensitivity the smaller the margin of error for your physical mouse movement is which is something Ive written about before it starts from the On high sens vs. low sens part. Considerations like that are to me much more likely to result in higher skill ceilings and better consistency and with that they are what can actually be used to determine a correct sens over fuzzy feelings of this seems like the right sens for me.Ive personally felt comfortable with a ton of sensitivities but Ive gotten the best results with sensitivities which are more on the midlow side and had I based how I chose my sens on the attitudes which are dominant in comp TF Id still be using a sens thats too high for me.Then theres the fact that its an aim guide yet it doesnt even mention aiming and dodging techniques. If I had to guess why that is itd be because he thinks that it doesnt matter how you aim and dodge. I disagree strongly and to this day I havent read anything from anyone which has made me throw away these ideas of mine that Ive had for like a couple of years now.So theres an example of a less skilled player me critiquing a more skilled players Vhalin points of view in a way that at the very least warrants a response other than but ur bad if someone wants to discard my ideas at least if the discussion is meant to be sensible and mature.I actually think that Im more likely to be right with this stuff than he is even though Im clearly worse than him.,truetf2,copg9px,1,t5_2stfn

Since youre getting into competitive Heavy Im assuming you have the basics of the class set on a serious level of course Im a firm believer in comp Heavy. Do you think that you have the level required for a team?Lobbies are only more organized games to say the least. Of course they are way more strict teach you some strats as well from just playing them. Although people play them for fun really and most of the time you wont run into the toxic side of lobbies if you do decent enough. As a heavy youre practically the backbone of the combo though if you think your capacities allow for such an important role then go ahead. Remember to play this for fun and not for actual competition.As some would say and overall lobbies are a good intro and Id suggest playing some lobbies before entering a team Tell you what a good friend of mine used to main Heavy and knows quite a bit about the class if youd like to I can tell him to add you if you have inquiries.,truetf2,coshnjb,4,t5_2stfn

3189797,0,t3_2wnn25,Hey so there are several points to address here and lets do them in order. The main rollout loadout should be Minigun sandvich and GRU or Bread GRU if youre fancy.  Once the initial rollout occurs you then have to choose between the FOS or GRU one saves you seconds of time each life but puts you at risk the other is safer but slower the key to choose which one is is the path to the rest of the team safe is it far or close compare viaduct point to process mid what is happening right now is there momentum or is everyone trading spam name do you need to be there  now all of these things you can figure out via good coms but remember for the most part it doesnt matter. FOS are good for force capping points or taking buffed peeks for snipers and location calls otherwise GRU it up.. There are a view guides on youtube but there really wont be that useful heavies POV generally moves around very quickly and erratically unless they are tracking and firing on a target. What you dont see is them checking for spies reacting to coms and knowing via gamesense and respawn timers where people should be coming from. The POV really boils down to look find track and kill. A little tip good spies will wait until youve engaged a target full or transitioning and in danger from an area to go on you. Its worth an occasional mid target flick behind to make sure youre not getting spied. Sorry there isnt more help here its just the nature of the class.. Do both! Lobbies will make you play against a variety of players and develop better gamesense and skills. Sure its not really like a proper match but there are still carry overs to be had and strong players on both teams can teach or challenge you to play better. At worst youll hone the ability to track players in a wild DM heavy situation. Join on team in UGC its about mid season but teams still want people look for iron or steel. So look for a team but lobby for fun and skills in the meantime the barrier for tf center is low and its a good way to have fun network and at least on some levels improve. Heck I often try hard in lobbies and do full coms and calls it might not matter much it enforces good habits.Best of luck and have fun! Ill likely play verus you in Center!PS with GRU out if you jump while taking damage itll boost you far away from the source possibly saving you from an otherwise certain death just a risky but neat trick you can try and pull off.,truetf2,cosmews,2,t5_2stfn

3253989,0,t3_2x68ss,Okay I just played the map. We named some of the areas differently though. Theres spawn then YardCourtCourtyard then the outdoor area that leads up the side and the Garage indoor area. The outdoor side path leads to the Shed and poophouse or Storage. Like OP said taking the shed to mid is risky but you can do it in one sticky and a pogo. Its easier to all pile through the garage.Did find out some very interesting things. You can explosive jump onto the windows above the two door exits for Garage. We had Medic on the point Demoman covering the shed and Scout and Soldier covering the two garage exits you can cover them very well. People standing right by the fences on the point can be hit by splash damage if you aim where the wire mesh is.Also you can get out of the map by jumping up the wall where the rocks and the boarded off tunnel are on one side.

3828836,0,t1_cqspbwq,What if Pomson puts a lock on Uber amp Cloak building for a second or two after hitting someone in addition to Cloak drain? Good for fighting DRs and it gives some incentive to hit the Medic. It helps build Uber advantage without draining their hard work and the Medic is still free to heal shoot a bolt or saw someone in the meantime. Short Circuit needs a total rework. The base idea sounds cool but in practice it can shut down two entire classes. Maybe if it consumed Metal like  of it per blast and it took a few seconds to recharge you could balance it. Make it the kind of thing you want to use tactically when theres six stickies underneath your Sentry. I dont know if its possible to balance this and make it not annoying though.Loch n Load needs a revert to prebuff. If they dont like the oneshots guess what? Caber already has a builtin oneshot prevention function. Classes with under  HP hit by it will have  HP left.I like your Enforcer idea though. Maybe faster weapon switch faster firing speed greatly reduced damage? The kind of thing you can whip out and quickly bodyshot a guy down but you need to be able to land each shot.One thing I would say is I think Rescue Ranger shouldnt be able to remotely grab a Sentry thats Wrangled. Let it unwrangle giving a brief moment of vulnerability before pulling it. Also makes Engineers have to consider tactically when to use Wrangler and if theyre going to need to pull out.A lot of other ones really just need bugs like reload fixed. A config setting shouldnt give advantage over the basic game functionality and even if you use it it needs to be on a perclass and peritem basis to avoid glitches with other weapons.

3965416,0,t1_cr88k5z,No Quake Live is better better aiming practice than TF. I say this from experience. Most weapons in Quake Live have no spread and importantly the LG and railgun have no spread. This means you get  accurate feedback on your aim. If you get a hit you got it because your aim was on point. If you miss you missed because your aim was off. In TF most hitscan weapons are either shotguns or have spread. This means that you can get hits without aiming well and you can miss even though youre aiming well. This dilutes the feedback on your accuracy. Youll still get better but not as quickly.Its also important to note that Quake Live require similar aiming skills as TF unlike say CS which emphasizes a different kind of aiming.

4102261,0,t3_37b8x1,The most important class is your leader andor carry.  The medic is only important if they are your team leader.  Not all medics are calling the shots.  However whoever is your leader must have good judgment and everybody must be on board with following their calls.  Fortunately a good leader had a bit more visibility on the action when they are dead.  So having your leader down is not necessarily a problem if their judgment is sound.  That said Ive been on teams with very high level carry classes   scouts spies and snipers  who can make a huge difference.  Being at the right place at the right time on pushes is absolutely huge. The sniper scout and spy on a new silver team we formed a few seasons back all went platinum after the season.

4235876,0,t1_cs321is,What you mentioned in your first paragraph is the most effective way to play heavy. Behind your demo and near your medic enough that you can stop anything rushing at you as well as spycheck and if necessary follow up the damage from your demo. Demos usually get the most heals during fights as he can output more damage to groups as well as control areas. Logswise however demos usually get between  more heals than the heavy simply because healingbuffing a heavy during stalemates or downtime is a good way to build uber without having someone shooting themselves. That is not a good representation of the people who receive the heals that actually matter during fights which should be demo and scout.As for the medics who prefer to heal a heavy it is probably because it is safer for them but against good players it will not work too well since heavy is not a good offensive class in most situations. On an actual organized team your medic can easily switch between pocketing your demoheavy depending on the situation although pocketing the heavy over the demo is reserved to when the other team is walking in to you ie. last few seconds of koth rounds since they should both be capable enough and play around the medic the entire time.When pushing if the heavy has crit heals then he should get buffed but during a push I would not recommend healing him unless your demo is not taking damage anyway. As I mentioned early a scoutdemo push is the best you can have as he can follow up your demos damage better than any other class. As a heavy you should stay next to your medic during these pushes spycheck make sure nothing is flanking you then come in after a few seconds once your demoscout open up some room.,truetf2,cs32v7o,4,t5_2stfn

4737114,1,t1_ctrkmuc,Why do you feel its uninteresting to watch? Is it an issue with the format itself or with the level of competition? Im interested in hearing more about your opinion. Here are my thoughts.In regards to the former weve tried to design this mode with the spectator eXperience in mind. Rounds are either resolved quickly and brutally tense standoffs or drawn out through multiple respawns. Diverse strategies are viable due to the open whitelist and shifting class restrictions. Losing a round because you off classed to spy is less impactful because of a larger number of rounds. Strategically I find AR much more interesting to discuss then the other modes. Positioning is important in s but imo thats about it for s strategy. Positioning and hitting your shots. What else could ascent have done against froyo but simply be better at killing clockwork? Frags are eXciting but personally I want more than that when i watch TF.With a higher level of competition in PBL we would get more eXcitement out of the format and thats definitely why we want more teams We realize that our regional restrictions do hamper some current rosters from becoming involved but we believe the benefits outweigh it. There is a lot of talent in TF but honestly we are the only organization out there trying to develop talent and put teams together. Individuals are seeking out individuals but locality will help strengthen bonds that are formed. We are working on improving the competitive level of our league through developing our players and recruiting new players and teams. We are hoping that with ESEA on break some teams will sign up to compete for the cash we have procured from sponsors. No fee no client  match days already scheduled.

Simply be helpful be humble be heroic when the opportunity comes be the bestest of buddies with your team and tell the enemy team to burn in hell like the stiff neck bastards they are.

Im very happy to see what appears to be the first sign of any league or community officially agreeing with me in part anyways obviously theyve not voiced that they hate this thing as passionately as I do.Sidenote thats only minimally on topic? I bought a strange Loose Cannon months ago for about  and named it This is a Fair and Balanced Weapon in hopes of pissing off enough people with it to warrant more complaints about it.

Regardless jumping ability is still really important for speed survivability and fighting and is absolutely something you should work on.  Not having good pogos or walljumps really isnt going to hinder you much at lower levels but again its worth at least knowing how to do them because youll naturally start doing them as your jumping ability gets better anyway.Jump maps are good for your general mechanics regardless of the class you play honestly.  ,truetf2,cw87u1m,4,t5_2stfn

I deliberately chose both old and recent examples to show that this is a problem that has plagued TF since its inception.Just looking at the Sandman the fact that Valve even introduced a weapon capable of removing a players control over their character which everyone knows is not fun is questionable but the fact that for half a year it was capable of destroying the most important mechanic in TF the ubercharge shows that they do not understand their own game even in a pub context.Far more important than when the issue was fixed is how long it took to fix. Sandman stunning ubers took  months. Splitting the Equaliser took two and a half years. Addressing Pomson spam at all took  months and properly reducing its effectiveness to something notstupid took over  and a half years. Fixing mini sentry build health took  years.

If that is the case theres not much you can do about it in a lobby sadly.However. One of the biggest mistakes newer demos make and even more experienced demos is overextending. When the red mist descends it can be very tempting to push forward. But as demo you should very very rarely be the furthestforward player on your team. It may be that you are going too close to the enemy drawing focus fire and making it dangerous or impossible for your medic to give you heals.I wouldnt say give up on demo yet. In my totally unbiased opinion hes the most fun class in the game and very rewarding to play in a competitive setting.

Can you tell me how exactly someone could avoid a Demoknight doing this?If the guy playing Demoknight is good enough youd need to have godlike aim to hit someone abusing the weird charge physics. The strange midair charge movement is not something as easily predictable as the player is able to increase their midair velocity whenever they choose which could cause an airshot to miss.Its not something that is helping the flow of the game as much as say a Stickybomb Launcher yet it is something really annoying for the one person whos getting destroyed by what is essentially a homing missile.,truetf2,cxt970e,6,t5_2stfn

A lack of ammo means I use lEtranger andor Big Earner. Most of the time the loadout is dependent on the map and the enemy players.

6278380,0,t1_cz395ob,Theory crafting and reality are unfortunately two different things. Yes HL probably has a higher theoretical ceiling if you just look at raw player number and classes being played. In reality those extra classes.pyro heavy engy etc actually limit the ceiling to something below v. The classes themselves are designed as something that slows down the game and makes it easier for everyone. Look atairblast its made and balanced in a way that detracts from the overall skill level and makes it easier for relatively unskilled players to do well. HL has a lot of classes and things that cause the ceiling to lower. Now look at v the entire game mode from classes to unlocks is created around fast paced and dynamic play this makes the skill ceiling higher because you have more to think about in a shorter time period. Now Im on my phone so fuck essays but you really dont even have to think that hard to see that HL while has higher player numbers is something that has a much lower skill ceiling because of the classes and effects they have in the game.,truetf2,cz3a4tm,7,t5_2stfn

A few examples of the nerfs are the wranglers reduced ammo and repair by  reduced repairing with the rescue ranger .s delay before your gun is active when it is sapped etc. With that in mind understand that in pubs level s will continue to be problematic as there is less coordination and lower skilled players who do not how to effectively counter a sentry. In highlander however it is at a point where engineers are considering to run minisentries more frequently on payload defense due to the fact that a level  sentry gun will just be taken down quickly and because they could be more effective by DMing with their minis and shotgun.So to answer your question yes at this current state engineer is balanced.,truetf2,czg55tl,26,t5_2stfn

6898798,0,t3_4a4g60,Personally being a damned Heavy main Ill be running Heavy until I cannot do so any further. Ive seen enough backandforth debate on this that its just at a point where I say fuck it Ill just find out myself. Fully ready to focus on bettering my Scout or Soldier game if I hit a quick wall with Heavy but Im taking Heavy as far as I can. I will say that Heavy is naturally a class that does amazing at lower levels and then becomes okay at higher ones so I dont exactly expect to be hitting any walls until higher ranks. When you get a bunch of people to install TF for the first time Heavy is simply the most practical source of damage and survival. As a Scout for example you try to avoid damage entirely rather than tank it but even a good scout can just end up in a scenario where they hit a doorway the same moment as a soldier and die OR they end up vs. a really competent demo that lands pipes and they die. Dont get me wrong mastering your dodges has big payoffs but no matter how good you get Scout will find situations where theres more or less nothing you could to. The same applies to Heavy but much slower since that Heavy doesnt have the issue of hitting a soldier at a doorway and that Demo needs to land at least three pipes before Heavy rips him apart. And all the while aim is much more forgiving. Understandably lower tier players struggle when facing Heavys more.   Highertier the main pattern is that Heavys go from being the front line to being the cover for the front line. The front line is gonna be the most mobile firepower Soldiers and Demos and Scouts. But for those instances when a team is REALLY commiting to killing your demo and your demo absolutely needs to back off for heals the enemy team needs someone waiting in the wing to dissuade them from pursuing the Demo to finish him off. Thats Heavy. Heavy has just as much firepower as the others its just his speed thats lacking. If Heavy is positioned directly behind the front lines themselves then attempting to rush down Heavy becomes suicide because the front line itself will collapse onto you not to mention the sheer distance traversed to reach Heavy will give him an edge since he was pegging you with bullets the whole way. Simultaneously hes still within range to be supportive yes he may be hitting modest s but hes hitting them constantly on targets that are already absorbed in their fight vs. an enemy scout or the like. That Heavy pegging them with s essentially gives them a time limit and throws off their game. Likewise for people pursuing the demo to finish him off this has become risk vs. reward as the likelihood of them dying in their pursuit just got exponentially higher.My advice to you if you wanna know if Heavy is viable or not is to test it yourself. Theres enough debate on this that the answer is more or less inconclusive. I will say however that yes Heavy is absolutely vulnerable to rushdowns and you need to understand that to survive. Great example Snakewater mid. Theres the cap point the wooden square area around the capture point with the rafters above and then theres these two tiny house buildings on each side not the ones you can walk inside that you can jump on top off to be at about half the height of the rafters themselves. As a Heavy? You do not ever extend past those little houses for the midfight. Doing so is just asking to be focused down and the moment youre focused down your team is fighting a man down. If you stand around the little houses or potentially even further back depending on positioning youre still very much capable of contributing to the fight with constant chip damage it may seem modest compared to what youre used to but it absolutely adds up. For any match you play a position similar to that example needs to be found you need balance between any team that tries to rush me down is fucking retarded and look at me Im actually contributing to the fight and not being useless.Also on that note matchmaking is the one place where I feel the stock minigun isnt viable. I mean its always viable but its inferior to the alternatives. If your team is aggressive? Run Tomislav. Your constant s will become constant s. Thats a big fucking deal for your damage output. It also  if youre feeling cheeky  does give you the potential to hide in a corner and jump someone as they pass as any experienced player is gonna hear the other miniguns. The downside is youll feel it versus Scouts at close range its gonna make an already close matchup even closer. assuming you win these if you lose youre gonna lose them even more than beforeIf your team is struggling run Natascha. Yes your damage takes a hit but if your team is simply underperforming and getting outfragged every time then you WILL be rushed down. The moment the midfight is lost you cannot escape. If you COULD escape it either means the enemy team derped hard or your positioning was too passive and unhelpful to your team. As such? You wanna buy time at least. Nataschas damage resistance means youre that much harder to take down and the slow effect means no one wants to get within  feet of you its a subtle mind game that hinders their offense a bit. With Natascha youre not gonna solo the fight vs a good team but you can leave such a dent in them that theyre gonna have less to capitalize off of. Id basically say that in the random matchmaking games I did Natascha could be the difference between killing  and injuring another in a rushdown vs killing all three of my attackers. Again Id not expect those results vs better players but it still highlights what its capable of.Anyways thats my two cents on how to get the most out of Heavy. Its mainly about understanding positioning understanding your weaknesses and when to run which gun.,truetf2,d0yapl7,3,t5_2stfn

6934327,0,t1_d0zobr1,gtWhat are some common situations when a medic should break from the standard heal order and prioritization?First of all heal order is not the same as  heals given to each class. Heavy for instance will probably get the second highest or even the highest  on your team but Id gladly drop my heavy to save a lot of other classes in many situations. To answer your actual question a few scenarios are. crit heals crit heals crit heals. make sure to always save your engi when possible on pl defense. tank your sniper if he really needs to focus down the enemy sniper or if you just need him to work a pick in moment x. most importantly whenever you have uber advantage prioritize offensive classes scout primarily but also soldier to a huge degree. gtIs it ever a good idea to chase heals?Usually not but hey there are exceptions to every rule. mojoes answer is comprehensive here. gtWhen is the medic least valuable as a pick?This is one of the bigger differences between hl and s. In s there are more situations in which focusing a medic is not worth it because thats dmg that can be used to take out people who are shooting you back and because medics cant heal as fast as you can output damage. Of course even in s medic picks are USUALLY valuable. In highlander there are fewer situations where focusing a medic is punishable because a you have so many more players with which to do it and two pick classes whose whole purpose revolves around obviously getting picks and b the fights move slower so a team cant punish your focus on a medic as much. The times when medic is least valuable are in really scrappy fights when everyone is getting aggressive and those  rockets or whatever might be better served somewhere else. This would include some midfights though again less frequently than in s and especially last pushesdefenses when ubers are out of the equation. gtTalk about the pros and cons of selling out your team to survive.mojoe mostly answered this well gtWho is the best medic of all time and why is it Pyyyour?the best s medic of all time is shade and its knoxxx if youre going for eu. in hl its cozen. right now Id probably say indust in s and nursey in hl but most medics nowadays are somewhat flawed.,truetf2,d12bz3z,3,t5_2stfn

7406489,0,t3_4gqi8w,gt So as you can see its not a secret club is here to conspire against pyro. I know I sound like an angry ranter probably accurate but its how I feel. I hate to bring Overwatch into this but the OW devs are working on the same principle issues that TF has right now. Bastion didnt work as a hero in a competitive sense. So the devs took info from the comp community and made serious big changes to how bastion worked.Regardless of everything else other people already brought up which is mostly just that your post is written in a way that makes Pyro sound awesome but you forgot to mention the actual reasons Pyro isnt used besides all of that this is a really poor example for a couple reasons Bastion wasnt reworked because he wasnt used in the competitive scene strictly he was reworked because he was god tier against bad players and useless against good ones. They reworked him to hopefully increase his viability against better players not just top tier players while decrease his power against worse players by encourging teamwork to make him stronger and weakening his solo capacity somewhat. Blizzard has already openly stated that they are completely comfortable with him not being very good in competitive games because itll basically become one of those things where making him good in competitive games would require making him super unfun to play against for everyone else and complete cancer against lower tier players which could make them not want to play the game. Its better for a character to suck ass against the  but be ok against most of the population than for him to be good against the  but make the  want to quit the game. This is something really applicable here too because the exact same thing is true about Pyro you would have to turn him into the most cancerous class of all time to make Pyro as competitive as like Scout.,truetf2,d2k2icf,2,t5_2stfn

Usually I grab another TFTV caster who wants to practice with me and then we cast whatever STVs we can find from Invite scrims or matches from that week that we missed. Its a great way to stay uptodate with all of the Invite games while practicing our skills. I then listen back to the VODs in the shower or on the way to work. I found that streaming on my main channel  having an audience isnt really necessary if you want to get good at casting. In fact its actually better to practice different techniques in secret because you dont risk embarrassing yourself publicly in front of a large group of people. When I show up on the casts I then look a lot more polished!  I got this idea from casters from other games who have similar practice regiments. Start with  minutes of vocal warmups and exercises look up speechtongue twisters or theater routines and then load up a demo and go. Im actually starting to do some practice without a cocaster to work on my ability to talk clearly for longer periods of time and if you cant find a co caster to practice with you I dont think thats an issue at all. ,truetf2,d2zdayq,7,t5_2stfn

Weve also been having other issues here and there because its silver week  so thats to be expected.A few of our core players were offline for unknown reasons so we attempted to pull ringers. Their team denied so we pulled subs that had other commitments and shuffled the playertable a bit.

8213247,0,t3_4rugkl,the gun is absolutely ridiculous now.with the fizzling removed you can still lay  stickies you just have to reload.  the faster charge and arm time give you much more reliable damage with it in general and the added damage on charge takes it even further. you lose some zoning ability but you make up for it by actually hitting things for way more damage than usual.another important part is that the bonus damage from charging them never wears off. so you can actually have stronger traps than with stock.also through manual testing i am pretty sure that the damage bonus is additive with the base damage reduction to have  damage at max charge. not entirely sure though.EDIT i take it back the low ammo makes this a fucking chore half the time. can be good for a very defensive team tho.,truetf2,d547kzr,20,t5_2stfn
8213284,0,t1_d53p46m,gt You also seem mislead to think that anyone of rTF came up with or even mildly suggested the more influential changes.Except that a lot of these changes are based on ideas that I have seen here. Ive seen Spy mobility discussed. Ive seen pissrifle changes discussed. And theyre added practically verbatim which would never have happened.gt Where would this game be without updates? Where would your precious class roles be without airblast sandviches gunboats or the kritzkreig? No Im not arguing that any diversity is better than none but youre more worried about how this changes things and now how you can change to fit them.Id like to point something out the problem isnt updates in general. Its that the original TF team developed those updates and they did them to intentionally round out and better define the original class roles. Airblast was a good addition to Pyro when it had basically nothing going for it. A utility item like Sandvich made sense because Heavy had no reason to ever use Shotgun in the first place it was a filler item. Kritzkrieg worked because it provided a fun backandforth element to toss up Ubers. But it didnt fundamentally alter the core mechanics. Kritz cant break through Ubers Ubers are still Ubers. If the current TF team invented Kritz theyd probably make critical hits deal damage to Ubers or somesuch. Because thats their idea of balanced. But the Kritzkrieg and Medigun are balanced around something else entirely their build times. Thats a clever way to make it competitive with what would otherwise be the better Uber you can build your aggressive medigun more aggressively and have it ready first.gt Spy has the lowest skill ceiling in the gameEntirely false. Id put him in the Top  easily of highest skill ceilings. Hes genuinely up there with Soldier and Scout. Or do you really think Pyro and Heavy have higher skill ceilings than Spy?gt  its completely undermined by any sort of awareness and communication. Not completely no. If anything Id argue Spy is overpowered on servers where theres no communication because it means every single player has to be Spyaware at all times. While an organized competitive environment makes Spy a lot less able to get picks the Spys job isnt really to do that. Its to sit in the wings provide comms of their own and to swoop in opportunistically. Not to go on backstabbing rampages.gt The only viable changes that can be made have to affect the classs base stats.Thats so  false and wrong Im not sure where to begin addressing it.First and foremost the base stats are fine. If the class needs more mobility survivabiliy or anything else it should be added as an item. But in a game about mobility giving the Spy extra mobility is going to be broken. Hes faster than most classes the same speed as the rest of them but hes not as fast as Medic and Scout. This is a perfect ratio Spy has precisely the amount of mobility that should be afforded to him without a boost.gt Teleporters are a solution to this but are often treated more as a luxury because of how expensive they are and how difficult they can be to defend.If your team cant defend your teleporter then they lose their teleports. Simple as that. Defend it or dont but they shouldnt be disposable and quick to rebuild.,truetf2,d547qzq,1,t5_2stfn

The only reason Im warning you about this is so that you dont join a team have them commit to you and then find out you dont actually like heavy at all let alone highlander heavy.

10334813,0,t1_dcfhk92,Yes really.  I thought people liked Medic for surfing and whatnot not because of a flimsy weapon.Ignoring stock melees assuming they had no melees apart from Engineer and Spy stock Heavy would be fine because most of the time theyre being pocketed or overhealed thus making the Sandvich useless most of the time.  Stock Pyro would be fine because the weapon swap speed of the Degreaser isnt necessary in order to play Pyro and the shotgun does more reliable and initially higher damage output than the Flare Guns flare.  Stock Scout is normally fine because seriously the Scattergun and the pistol are just good weapons there isnt really anything to argue about with Scout.  Stock Engineer would work because the shotgun does a decent amount of damage both the shotgun and the pistol are good for getting rid of pesky stickybombs as well as dealing with Spies.  IMO the Engineers wrenches are the most balanced weapons in the game compared to other classes weapons theres always a best option for most other classes.Did it seem like I wanted to use the Bonesaw?  Im sorry I didnt mean that.  I really meant that sometimes I want to use the Amputator but seriously tho the healing aura taunt is a joke for the extra healing or the Vitasaw for the extra Uber upon respawning.
