129486,0,t3_1vjp84,Id suggest doing more weightlifting partially because I find fit girls very hot if you have access to gym. However to get good results and avoid injury you will have to learn quite a lot about programming proper execution of exercises and anatomy. You might want to consider doing more intense cardio too for example HIIT High Intensity Interval Training. Remember to start slow and safe. And if you have heart problem avoid it altogether.,progresspics,cet6dzq,-1,t5_2sl0y

567607,0,t1_cg4jo5i,I went from a life time of eating a lot to  calories over night.  It wasnt hard though... thats because I chose not to quit junk food and everything I like to eat but eat it in smaller much smaller portions. I was hungry the first week... then I got used to eating this way. I could eat half a pizza back then but now I would throw up and get sick if did that. This is an example of what I do with my  calories  skip breakfast I did this since I was a kid... mom didnt wake up to make us breakfast or pack us lunch... she left money for us to buy food in the school cafeteria and recess wasnt until  so Im not used to eating that early. I live alone and dont cook so theres this Cocina Econmica they serve you home made meals for  for take out one block away from my house.  I get steamed veggies half a cup of rice and  enchiladas   calories aprox. If I go out to dinner with friends I eat  tacos   calories aprox real Mexican tacos not Taco Bell Tacos. The  calories left are reserved for snacks... I go buy a diet coke and I like to get  Almond Hershey Kisses. Or a candy or an extra taco.  If I go over the top one day I spread those extra calories over the next days to compensate.  If I know I have a barbecue with friends I eat very little over the day and save my calories for the event. I share a lot... If I want a burger Mexican street burgers are huge I bring someone along and share one burger. I dont stress about it too much... this was a lifestyle change not a diet. Since the second month of my journey Ive memorized the calories in almost everything I eat I dont log it just estimate it in my head. When I get to my goal weight Ill just eat  calories for the rest of my life and thats it. ,progresspics,cg4sj24,9,t5_2sl0y

577220,0,t1_cg5vjq9,Yeah every day. I have slacked off a couple days in a row and I can feel the acid at the very base of my esophagus if that makes sense. I am telling you it was almost over night the difference. I had a  bottle of tums a week habit too but since the probiotic I have only taken tums like maybe twice when i way over ate. I am sure the healthy eating helps too as well as portion control but I swear by probiotics. I have a cheat day once a week and go out and get what ever i want usually the greasiest burger I can find or ever real spicy stuff food i would of never even thought about eating before and I have no problems. I am against mainstream western medicine. I know that there are alternative out there. Most these issues that we deal with have come about in the last couple centuries. I am not guaranteeing that this will cure you but it is worth the shot especially as probiotic really only promotes healthy bacteria in your gut where as that OTC crap is chemicals. You really should give it a try.,progresspics,cg5vue7,2,t5_2sl0y

795512,0,t1_cgui6ia,Sure thang.Im in the UK and at the beginning of September last year I joined Slimming World. I dont know if they have it in other parts of the world but if you want to check it out visit www.slimmingworld.comThe first time I went was the first time I had been weighed in about  years. I had always avoided scales because I knew Id be mortified seeing the result. Getting on the scale and seeing a number higher than  terrified me and I knew at that point I was going to have to change my life.I followed the Slimming World plan... eh its kind of hard to explain in a Reddit comment so Ill link you to this blog where someone has already explained it... Weighing in once a week keeps my mind on my weight loss and as you can see from the blog post there is TONNES of food to be enjoyed so I dont feel like Im depriving myself. I have made some amazing friends at group who are so supportive. You receive certificates etc for each half stone you lose. Little things like this help keep me motivated plus a round of applause from my fellow group members every time you have a loss or words of encouragement and assistance if you so happen to have a gain.To be honest the way I approach food has changed forever. I am constantly food optimising  I can still go for a curry but instead of having a fatty and creamy chicken korma with a naan I have a chicken rogan josh with boiled rice. Skimmed milk instead of whole. Diet cola instead of normal. Wholemeal bread instead of white.All of these things have become second nature to me now.So there you go a massive Slimming World plug. But to be completely honest I NEVER could have gotten to where I am now without the group. Joining was one of the best things I ever did.Oh yeah exercise. I dont exercise all that much  I work an office job so Im sat on my ass everyday which is irritating. I make an effort to walk as much as possible  parking the car further away in the mornings going for walks in the evening etc. Once I have lost another lbs I will join the gym to start ironing out the creases. Still a bit self conscious to join just now.,progresspics,cgupbdo,3,t5_2sl0y

984517,0,t1_chg3xki,Congratulations on your sobriety! I know firsthand how difficult it is when quitting an unhealthy addiction and replacing it with another. I have an addictive personality in general and found since getting clean I had apattern of cycling through video game addiction shopping addictions etc but the main one I always found the most satisfaction in other than drugs and alcohol was food. I remember when I started keto I had a joke with myself that I had become powerless over carbs and my weight had become unmanageable. I found the thing that got me through most of the crap I have had to deal with was definitely humor. Anyways its so great to hear these kind words from you and to hear your story and the parallels we share. Its certainly a weird place to feel healthy for once and not have such detrimental coping mechanisms. I do realize though that like alcohol and drugs I will probably have to keep careful watch for the rest of my life as those patterns feel good an are so easy to fall back into. Keep on trudging the road of happy destiny man  ,progresspics,chg7475,1,t5_2sl0y

1009207,0,t1_chiyp7i,In  I was lethargic. I stood in one spot for almost  hours a day for work and would sit at home the rest of the day. I simply made sure to ride my bike for an hour every day that I could.I then stopped keeping food in my house. If there is food it has to take time to prepare. No instant shit because my mind shuts down and my body starts consuming. I cant help it Ive tried and tried and to this day I still have problems going for free food.I did that for two years and then I didnt change much for a year while I went through a terrible relationship that ended with me having no sleep and attempting suicide.A year and a half ago a Planet Fitness popped up only two blocks away and I figured it was a sign since I had just started doing a combo of situps squats and pushups.I quickly fell in love with the Elliptical and Ive been doing that ever since at least twice a week. I had also gotten a job as a Server which is INCREDIBLE because its so active.This year I started counting calories and I dropped lbs in two months it was ridiculous. Im down to my current weight with a healthy dose of elliptical no more than k calories every day wed and sat are my free days if I HAVE to sexercise and biking whenever I can instead of driving.Oh and I drink boatloads of water to keep me from eating more. Ive given up sugar drinks entirely unless its a treat or alcohol. That was actually the hardest part. I probably quit pop  times in the last  years but Ive finally got a handle on it. Every time I did Id lose lbs.Also my waist went from  to  aside from the noticable excess energy thats the nicest part. I barely fit into that suit but I did and my eyes teared up when I did. I might be obsessed with it since it was a random  suit from goodwill haha.,progresspics,chj069i,2,t5_2sl0y
1014444,0,t1_chjgl4f,Hmmm most likely your plateau is due to a lack of caloric deficit.  Have you calculated how many calories your body needs to maintain your weight?

My mum handled it so badly but she scared me into seeing what I was doing to myself. She grabbed me by my shirt and dragged me through the house saying she was going to take me to hospital and have me admitted because she couldnt take it anymore.

Then I started lifting for like  months later I added min of stepmill  days a week on top of that  day split. Currently I do  day lifting split but with no cardio feel like I see more results from that. Also I changed my diet abit trying out keto now. That did get me abit more shreded and also my digestion is much better with no carbs. I think its mostly about diet just eat less and choose foodsdiet that will hurt you least.

1557513,0,t3_2c2gcy,I told this story on here before so I wont expand on it heavily. Its in my post history somewhere. Im a  guy at about ish and an athletic build. Im not really sure at this point. I only weigh myself if Im doing tournaments. I used to be a severe bulimicanorexic young man in high school. TypeA personality as well. I was horribly overweight in junior high and went from around  to  in a very short period of time like a couple months. I went into a cardiac unit and an eating disorder program. Once they felt they could discharge me I became obsessed with staying around what they called the perfect weight. It took a while to just be happy with myself and learn that its not about a perfect weight its and this will sound corny and sitcomish about just being healthy and enjoying the skin youre in. As a guy it was hard for me to have the youre beautiful mentality and very difficult to reach to others because of the stigma of having an eating disorder as a male. You have to remember what you feel like at that ideal weight and just hold on to that happy feeling where you can look in a mirror and be like good job man. Then the scale isnt important. What you feel about you is important. Keep up the good work and recovery. You look incredible. I hope your heart is physically okay too. That was the hardest to recover. ,progresspics,cjbiacw,14,t5_2sl0y

1583370,0,t1_cjedc24,Ok this might be a lengthy response so I apologize! In the before picture I had done PX all the way through about  times. I was getting tired of doing the same thing and wanted to know more about how lifting worked and how it could change my body. I joined a gym and started going every day and working on my own routines. Ive bumped around a lot in terms of weekly splits repset numbers etc. What I usually do now is thisWeek  This week I focus on working up until failure. I usually do a warm up set something I can do  reps pretty easily with then do  more sets adding more and more weight with each set. I go until failure for every one and on the last set as soon as I fail I drop back down to my warmup weight and go until failure again. I do this with pretty much every exercise for this week. I do the muscle groups highlighted below for this week so usually one major group a day.Week  I usually like to do a Day split so ChestBack LegsAbs ShouldersArms. Ill do these two times a week with one day being a designated heavy day where I work up to a one rep max and one designated light day where I usually do more reps usually    and  if Im doing four sets of something. I like to do more compound movements on heavy days and more isolationbody weight movements on light days.Week  This week I divide up into a HeavyMediumLight split with  muscle groups a day. So Heavy ChestMedium ShoulderLight Tricep or Heavy BackMedium BicepLight Legs. I then just switch up the order of these and do them  more times that week so for example it would be Monday Heavy ChestMedium ShoulderLight Tricep but then on Wednesday it would be Heavy TricepMedium ChestLight Shoulder and so on. Does that make sense? Sorry if thats tricky to understand! Usually for medium things I do  reps and light I do  in this week.Week  This week I usually just mess around with supersets and drop sets! Not much order going on here haha.These are some of the exercises I do for my muscle groups!Monday ChestCalves Incline Bench Flat Bench Dumbbell Chest Press superset with a Dumbbell Fly  loooong holds Decline Cable Fly Flat Cable Crossover Incline Cable Fly Hammer Strength Chest Press Chest Dips. For calves my favorite exercise is to take a stepup platform I think thats what theyre called and put it at the Smith Machine. I put some weight on the bar and stand so my heelsfeet are hanging slightly off the back of the platform and then I raise up. I also like to do calf raises on the leg press and seated calf raises too!Tuesday BackAbs Deadlifts Sumo Deadlifts Hyperextensions Bent Over Rows both underhand and overhand grip usually superset with a OneArm Dumbbell Row Hammer Strength Rows Wide PullUps I used to climb a lot and these helped a ton Close Grip PullUps Cable Rows Lat Pulldowns I do regular as well as reverse grip on these I also sometimes like to take the handles vs the bar and pulldown as well! Ill write my ab routine on Sunday below. Wednesday LegsCalves Squats Box Squats Hack Squats usually lighter weight but a huge hold at the bottom Leg Extensions superset with lying Leg Curls Leg Press I usually finish with this I dont like it as much as squats Walking Lunges I grab a pair of dumbbells and go to town on the track usually doing  lunges.Thursday ShouldersAbs Military Press Arnold Press Dumbbell Front Raises Dumbbell Lateral Raises Cable Upright Rows Cable Lateral Raises Shrugs Bent Over Lateral Raises. Friday ArmsCalves Barbell Curls Preacher Curls Cable Forearm Curls Side Hammer Curls s curl from the bottom to halfway  times from halfway to the top  times then the full ROM  times Negative Curls if you have a partner this is a great one that gives a delicious pump! Have them push down as you are bringing the weight back down and fight their push Incline Skull Crushers Rope Tricep Extensions Dumbbell Tricep Kickbacks Seated Overhead Tricep Press Dips.Saturday The Big Three Why SquatBenchDeadlift of course! I usually work up to  rep max on these and pyramid back down.Sunday CardioAbs I usually swim for a half hour or so. I do slight cardio every day usually about  minutes. For abs I really like to do weighted things and then once I cant do any more I drop the weight and start doing just bodyweight. For abs my favorite things are Hanging Leg Raises Decline SitUps VCrunches Windshield Wipers Cable Crunches Kayak Twist I think thats what its called Oblique VUps Dumbbell Decline Twists.As far as my diet goes I havent quite figured out how to tailor caloriesmacros to fit my body yet but plan to do that soon. I eat pretty healthy but once or twice a week I like to eat Dominoes cheesy bread or pecan pie or something. I usually just try to get about  calories in and get about  or so grams of protein. Then the rest of the day I fill the rest with carbsfats. My day is usually set up like thisBreakfast  Eggs  whites  cup oats blueberries.MidDay Snack Almonds Salt and Vinegar are awesome protein shakeLunch Tuna or ground turkey with broccoli or spinachMidAfternoon Snack Quest Bar Cottage Cheese with grapes or somethingDinner Chicken or tilapia with vegetables and quinoariceAll in all its usually pretty clean but Im not a guy who will shove clean eating down your throat. I do it because I like buying things kind of basic Ive never really liked chipspoptartsetc. and Ive always eaten this way. Not saying this is the right way to do things if you know how to track macros right you can eat what you want and get great results. Just wanted to throw that out there just in case people might bash me!As far as supplements go keep it simple. No and I repeat NO supplement is going to be some miracle pill. Trust me last year I spent  on a month supply of Shredz like a sucker. Stuff like thats not worth your money. Spend it on food. Anywho I take g of creatine a day check this out its what I use and a scoop of whey protein after my workout I use Gold Standard if anyones interested. I also drink green tea every morning and take psyllium husk powder for fiber every day.Well thats about it! Give yourselves time and keep going push yourself every day and never lose sight of your goals! ,progresspics,cjer8ur,15,t5_2sl0y

Hot yoga will kill you. Once that stopped working I started to basically cut all carbs even fruit cut alcohol to once a week and no sugar in the mix and ate higher fat full fat dairy essentially any lowno carb diet. This is only until i get to my goal weight then Ill slowly integrate fruit back into my diet and lower my fat again. ,progresspics,cjktxe9,2,t5_2sl0y

1691129,0,t1_cjsb4ub,My fitness pal app has saved my life!! I have not stopped using it for one day. Weighing your food helps  eating raw foods and protein is good too but mostly just COUNT YOUR CALORIES!! if you eat low cal foods you can eat a ton and still lose weight!  My favorite thing to eat is homemade salad with reduced cal feta cheese avocado grilled chicken red onion tomato etc and has less calories than one piece of pizza!  Exercise is important too but I usually just take long walks and intermittent jogging because I have asthma. Any movement is good movement. Take progress pictures every two weeks because it gets harder to tell the difference the longer it takes to lose weight ,progresspics,cjsbx4m,10,t5_2sl0y

2144899,0,t1_clcfr7w,You still have to eat right and exercise after the surgery.  Often times it makes it so you have a limited number of foods you can actually eat. People that are successful with the surgery often have fairly strict diets because their pouch or smaller stomach with VSG literally cannot handle foods. RNY patients have the hardest times because the slightest wrong ingredient in something may have them puking for hours. Not to mention its a major operation and can be a hard recovery. I had mths where even water made me violently sick. Not even zofran helped my nausea. Leafy greens make me incredibly sick and I absolutely love spinach but can only eat it if Im willing to deal with having awesome diarrhea the rest of the night. People dont do it because its the easy way out. It fucking sucks and it alters the rest of your life. We still have to exercise and eat right if we want to lose the weight it doesnt just magically disappear. ,progresspics,clcgr7r,9,t5_2sl0y

2209120,0,t1_clkmkhn,LOL  its ok  first question I usually get asked is if I had surgery no! followed closely by the skin question! It actually is not that bad.  Im not sure if thats because I lost the weight slowly maybe Im still young enough for good elasticity or what. It was definitely my biggest worry about losing the weight and I was scared that I would lose the weight and still not feel good about myself. There is definitely some loose skin there but its not nearly as much or as bad as I thought it would be. And thankfully Ive already made peace with it if it doesnt go away because I still look a bazillion times better than I did at  lbs!,progresspics,clkmsvq,74,t5_2sl0y

2214487,0,t1_cllb4lu,Because we need to be addressing the bigger issue here and thats mental health. Weight loss doesnt fix a person at the core unfortunately. For some getting the surgery serves as a tool because it physically restricts how much you can eat. People can choose to ignore that but some wont or simply cant. It can jump start the reality that wow I needed to have SURGERY in order to not die from obesity I have to get this under control. Surgery isnt for everyone but it IS for some people and we shouldnt make them feel bad for trying to get their shit together.,progresspics,cllbc1u,0,t5_2sl0y

2699358,0,t1_cnau1by,It looks like you have a system that for works you already on the weight loss side.When you train abs try to imagine pulling your belly button through to your back. It is similar to sucking your stomach in but you are flexing your abs while you crunch or sit up. The idea is to pull the muscles in not out. People typically want muscular legs arms shoulders etc. But you dont want muscular abs as that will make your stomach look fat instead of lean. When doing abs focus on ensuring you are not pushing your abdominal wall out. Here is an example of someone that did not properly train their abs Compare that to this person I did pick guys instead of women but the point is the same. The first guy will look like he has a gut with a shirt on. The second wont.At any rate you look great now.

2733813,0,t3_2rczl5,Bear with me here as Im going to be  honest...There is absolutely no difference between the two pictures. Any change you think has happened to you is in your head you are no different than before.  pounds can just be from a week where you ate a few too many sugary or fatty items.If youre looking to put on muscle you need to do the following. Get on a program that focuses  different muscle groups a day and I mean actually work them if you stop when it starts to burn a bit youve gone to the gym for nothing.. Eat at a surplus. This means eating more calories than your body needs so it can get its needed nutrition and have extra left over to rebuild the microtears that youve done to your muscles. You also need to be making sure the stuff you eat is at least relatively healthy. You dont have to eat clean and limit yourself to just chicken and veggies. You can do IIFYM if it fits your macros and generally eat whatever you want as long as it adds up at the end of the day.. Optional if you are looking to gain more definition than straight up muscle. The option if youre just trying to look good without clothes on.  Do a lot of cardio and do a little bit less intense weight training. If you want to really go for it you could do cardio everyday on top of muscle workouts. Despite what people say cardio doesnt kill gains in the absolute sense it just means you probably have to eat another  calories that day to get the same effect. Generally speaking carbs are shitty as a main source of nutrition carbs are things like bread cereal pasta etc as they break down and metabolize into sugar which gets converted to fat. So limit carb intake. You mainly want to eat protein fruits veggies and a handful of carbs.,progresspics,cnetmrn,4,t5_2sl0y

3029436,0,t3_2utrfe,Diet  I started by cutting out all pasta bread and beer.  I was a  beer a day drinker and heavy whiskey on the weekend.  This was very difficult.  It took me about  days before my body was okay with the changes I made.  I substituted this with a gallon of water a day.  This is very important! The next thing was to make smarter choices at dinner when I was out.  Opting for the salad over the burger or pizza not eating the chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant etc. Once I had these changes under control it was time to make other changes.  I started eating veggies at every meal lots of protein like chicken fish tuna etc. Typical day for me was the following  Breakfast    hard boiled eggs only eating the yolk out of  of them and a protein shake or barSnack  banana apple carrots or almondsLunch  grilled chicken breast and veggies or black beans.  I would also eat canned chicken.  I know some people hate it but it has  grams of protein.  I would just add a little relish mustard and light mayo.  Snack  protein bar or shakeDinner  grilled chicken salad veggies light oilSnack  pretzelsTraining  Ive always lifted.  I was lifting on the pic to the left when I was .  But eating bad and just working out wasnt doing anything for me.  So along with diet I added cardio.  I would play basketball  days a week and run  minutes  days a week.  Youll be surprised if you go from no cardio to just a little how much weight you drop.  I workout during my lunch break while at work and will run at night.Monday Chest and Triceps  Flat Bench  x Incline Dumbbells  x Flies  x Palms facing inwards chest press  x Incline flies  x Dips  x  weighted Tricep extensions  x Skull Crushers  x Triangle pushups  x Tuesday Legs  Squats  week heavy  week light usually on heavy days I do  x  and on light days I do  x Power cleans  I added these and love them.  They are amazing!  I usually do  x Deadlifts  x Leg press  x Leg curls  x Leg extension  x Calf extensions  x Wednesday Back and BicepsPull ups  x Lat pull wide  x Lat pull close palms facing you  x Bent over rows  x Back extensions  x Standing curls  x  each arm sets of sSeated hammer curls  x Thursday Shoulders and AbsOverhead press  x Overhead press with twist i call them arnolds  x Upright row  x Plate raise  x Lateral raise  x Lateral raise hold with resistance band  sets of  secondsWith abs I do a mix of stuff from insanity and just crunchesplanksFriday and Saturday  I usually run and do any body part that is not tired.  Sometimes Ill take Saturday and do a full body workout.  But mostly it is a somewhat rest day.  Or if i miss a lift during the week ill use Saturday to make it up.  Supplements  I take a preworkout before my lift.  Right now im taking Anarchy by muscle tech I take creatine dextros sugar and a BCAA.  I take all these in the morning and post work out.  I am also using BSN Syntha protein powder  times a day.Sleep   hours a night.  Bodybuilding.com is a great source for any help you need.  They have supplements workouts articles diets etc.  I use this a lot to help me.  There are days I cheat.  Like last night while posting this I was eating a chicken pot pie.  It was the only thing in the fridge and I did not feel like prepping chicken.  I dont have many cheat days but its okay to have one every once in a while. ,progresspics,cobzykb,3,t5_2sl0y

Talking to a girl is a very anxiety riddled activity for me despite having been with what I deem to be a decent amount of em for my age. Eh listen man im not going to sit here and sugarcoat things for you. Being overweight my whole life had an impact on my confidence. The women I attract are usually considered unhealthy. Bigger girls definitely have an affinity for me which I dont mind since I like curves but even then im so insecure about what my friends would think if I were to bring a girl thats on the big side home that I dont even indulge in my attraction to them.

3199034,0,t1_cotj0dt,Oh man those last    were so torturous!  Its difficult being so close and so far at the same time haha!  With regard to cheat days I never planned any but I did exceed my allotment here and there mostly as a result of poor estimationplanning skills.  For example I was so so happy to see that a Chipotle quesadilla was only  calories and I went crazy getting them at least once a week.  Of course later I found out they were actually  calories which meant some days I totally overshot.  Other times friends invited me out and the online menu didnt match the one in the restaurant so I had to fudge things a bit.  I dont think I ever exceeded  calories though.  As far as I understand it so long as your weekly calorie average is about right you should be fine with a cheat day.  Good luck!  ,progresspics,cotkvh4,3,t5_2sl0y

Also if youre not watching your sodium a nice brine and a day in the smoker makes for a great turkey or chicken jerkey with spicysweetsavory glaze of your choice of course.

3557324,0,t1_cpxr40s,Well its been a while. In  I just tried to be healthier eating less long walks ect. I lost a lot of my weight doing conventional stuff that I would not recommend to anyone. Such as calorie counting and eating processed things. For the last lbs or so I did the vegan thing and a lot of cardio. During this time I also got my mental situation in check. When you lose a ton of weight it changes everything about you so becoming whole and comfortable in your own skin is work. For the past year I have been into for lack of a better term my own version of Paleostyle eating and HIIT traininglifting very heavy. I currently workout about twice a week for  minutes. I just go really hard with squats rows sprinting and random body weight exercises. It was unsustainable to workout a ton like I had been in . I eat super clean. Most results people get will be from diet. I think consistency is key which is why having a positive attitude is an important asset.I also wanted to add that I do intermittent fasting where I eat all of my food for the day between pmpm. I didnt even think of it because its habit. I think its been very helpful because I never feel too hungry like I used to.I have work in a bit but would be more than happy to answer any questions when I get home  ,progresspics,cpxrc2q,14,t5_2sl0y

3711184,0,t1_cqfam9t,You are WAY above Keto limits with these macros!To get into keto you have to extremely SMASH carbohydrates from your diet below gr daily for the first few WEEKS. Or else Ketosis wont happen.What WILL happen is youll go into starvation mode cold fingersfeet are one of the symptoms. Feeling kinda tired comes next where the body grabs every little carb and protein it can and even eats your muscles away. But thats not what you want. Youd be loosing muscles and water but not fat.In order to loose weight by going into ketosis your diet must be around  Fat about  Protein and a mere  carbs or youll drop out of it very quickly. One dish with too many carbs is enough... Experienced that firsthanded. Also too much protein doesnt work either as your body will just synthesize glucose from protein gt go into Insulin mode same as carb mode.Aim for Glycogen mode which is fatmode. Each fatty meal triggers an overhead of Glycogen production like Insulin would which  however  doesnt store glucose but retrieves it from fat cells. You body cant store these fatty acids again so theyll either be used burned or dropped like peeing em out. Also since your brain cant work on fatty acids but the rest of the body can your liver will produce ketones from these fatty acids which the brain can burn perfectly. Even better than glucose apparently. THATS full ketosis mode.And a single dish with just maybe gr carbs can throw you out of it.What happens then is the body throws away ALL ketones because insulin spikes high to absorb all the new carbs  thus stopping glycogen production completely. Youll be thrown into the insulinhunger deadlock again where too much insulin production makes you crave even more carbs because you gave it just a little.Keto is tough for the first few days but as long as you keep to your calculated macros !!!!!!!!! I CANT EVEN OVEREXCLAIM THIS POINT!!!!!!!!! youll eventually be and stay in ketosis. High fat MODERATE protein and low carb will melt your fat stores.Also youll know by the smell of your pee when youre in ketosis..From my point of view you are not going into ketosis right now. Below gr carbs per day is the max to STAY in ketosis but too high to get into ketosis when starting Keto. ,progresspics,cqfatqg,1,t5_2sl0y

If you want to see real change youll also need to do more strength training.  Heavier stuff like pushups squats and lunges with weights. You dont have to buy weights.

4238273,0,t3_39heec,My journey began about  years ago in front of a bathroom mirror. I wish I could remember the specific time and date as well as that last desperate excuse I gave myself for why I was the way I was. It was most likely caused by a culmination of unhappy stares and belly fat tugs but eventually I convinced myself to do something about my weight. At my worst I teetered around  pounds pounds heavier than my average weight in high school. I was often depressed insecure and unhappy with myself.For about a year I was up and down happy and then unhappy. I dieted. I worked out. I tried making it a lifestyle change. I would lose  pounds gain  pounds lose  pounds and gain . I was yoyo dieting and I was starvingboth mentally and physically. What if this lifestyle change was part of the problem? My diet was horrible as a child. Although I dont blame my parents because they most likely didnt know better and how can you blame them when a new study funded by the very product its researching comes out every week telling us something contradictory to what weve been told?. Everything I was fed in school at baseball practice on the football field and in the stores was slowly killing my selfesteem pound by pound.After months of research and years of experience I believe I finally found the secret to weight lossremoving sugar. Its been added to almost every food you pick up at the grocery store and its probably why you are failing at getting the body you want. Plain and simple I was addicted to sugar.Without getting into specifics unless someone asks my diet consists of this Eat only what God or Mother Nature created and eliminate refined carbs and oils. I do not count calories anymore. Once you remove the sugar from your diet you will understand the cravings your body gives you. I do not shy away from eggs ribeye steak avocados butter olive oil. But I do stay away from rice bread etc. Why? Because rice is a highly concentrated form of carbs that we wouldnt normally come across in the form weve modernized in.I thought that if I only cut out a certain amount of calories than Id be able to get to my goal weight. But I was literally starving myself at a nutrient level and it made me feel horrible. In a few days I will have gone  weeks without added sugar in my diet. And almost just as long without refined carbs I still eat fruits at certain times such as before a workout etc.. I dont wish to argue about whether or not calories in vs calories out works because it does. But I believe if you want your weight loss to stick the key is to remove the sugar that is in your food. I no longer feel hungry or starved. I no longer crash at in fact Im writing this when most people are reaching for that little pick me up. Sugar is a drug but weve somehow turned a blind eye to it because its such a huge market. In fact sugar was such a large market that slaves were stolen from Africa to create it synthetic insulin is a billion dollar industry and health care is the most profitable industry in America. I hope you will take what Ive written to heart because I hated how I felt when I was overweight. Society makes you think its your fault but what if weve been tricked by big money and corporate profit margins into feeding our bodies food that is causing all these problems? I dont have the body that I want yet. But Ive reached my goal weightwhich has now become an old goal. Just remember be happy with who you are now.

Edit and to answer your question about sugar you have to look on the actual ingredients. Sugar fructose sucrose honey corn syrup cane juice etc are all forms of added sugar.

I dont care who you are not even the elite . could do that. There are literal studies done on men who have natural test and are considered in the . category and they didnt come close to that number.If you truly are natural you need to get to a doctor and the Human Health Institute to get your protein synthesis checked out because your blood could quite literally be the cure for cancer if you are able to convert protein to mass that readily.Just be honest.

4651194,0,t1_ctgty18,Sure although I dont have much to tell. Really just being mindful of my portions and the kinds of food I am eating. Primarily protein loading up on veggies when I can meaning throwing every veggie available on a sandwich salad bores me and minimizing carbohydrates. I cut soda and other sweet drinks out of my diet almost completely and try to drink water almost constantly. I practice intermittent fasting maybe twice a week meaning that I wont eat a meal until around  or  in the afternoon and again being mindful of my portions when I do eat. Aside from that I go outside and walk my dog an average of  or  miles each day. Sometimes less sometimes more. I walk at a steady pace nothing too grueling but a tad quicker than a leisurely stroll. Ill usually take a cheat day once sometimes twice a week eating an entire pizza to myself if I feel like it. The amount of beer I like to drink has probably been the biggest obstacle but like food I try to just be mindful of how much I have drank and if I overdo it I just say Oh well and maybe walk a little extra that week because in my previous attempts to lose weight the real killer was always getting discouraged when I fell off of my routine and started saying fuck it and eating far more than needed on a regular basis.TLDR Walking every day being mindful of what and how much I am eating and trying my best to not get discouraged when I start fall off the wagon so to speak.,progresspics,ctgueqp,7,t5_2sl0y

Low body weight was just as much of a concern as high however OPs weight wouldnt have raised any flags and youll notice I never said OP was underweight. If you browse this sub at all you see women who are  and have very high body fat  and women who are  and outstandingly athletic. BMI may be used as a rough estimate but body fat  and ab ratio are much much better at indicating health.Medicine just uses BMI because you dont actually have to see the patient to calculate it and  of the time it doesnt change the course in treatment. However when dosing medications the calculations are simply used as an estimate. Like anything else BMI accuracy is a bell curve and when you have billions of people on the earth that means a lot are going to be outside of the norm.Also that study is well respected. Most doctors especially ICU like to see someone who isnt very small because their body is mobilizing huge amounts of resources to healstay alive. No one wants to see a cachectic old woman come in theyre the first to go. Once you hit the obese category they have the same degree of outcomes as underweight people.,progresspics,ctxkhh3,6,t5_2sl0y

As the diet got more strict I started to do short jogs and low weight high rep exercises. In my opinion the diet is far more important than the exercise. Once I got my diet right the weight really started to fall off compared to when I was exercising and still eating badly.,progresspics,cwilee9,1,t5_2sl0y

5893041,0,t1_cxs2kcz,I nibble at my lunch from the time I get to work until about noon at my desk.  I have that luxury.  I usually take an hour at PM to run errands and such and also get some soup.  So the chicken potato and veg are kind of my breakfast  brunch  lunch.Carbs.  I like potatoes for their simplicity of prep.  I am not opposed to pasta whole grain or regular old semolina or bread but potatoes are just so easy.  Sometimes I will have sweet potatoes as a change but theyre not really my favorites.  Thats about the extent of it.  Again I like to keep it simple and easy.  Easy to measure easy to track easy to repeat.My program as of right now... x a week.  Because I cant hold the bar for a low back squat and since I hate front squats I just dont squat.  As my shoulder improves that may change but right now I dont have the ability to rotate my hands back enough without pain.So my routine isLeg press x working sets  because leg presses arent as taxing as squats.Stiff legged deadlifts x working sets my hamstrings need the extra work and my shoulder isnt yet strong enough for really heavy deadsBench x WS  I am using a machine for this because of my shoulder and my biceps tendon.OHP x  barbell no machine.  This rarely bothers my shoulder or biceps tendon but I am pretty weak at it so...Shrugs  I alternate heavy barbell  currently x WS with moderate dumbell xTriceps x  I alternate push downs with rope extensionsCable rows x  because I am not doing regular deadsLat pulldowns  narrow grip x for the same reasonsDumbell curls  one day hammers x one day concentation x and one day hammers  drop sets to failure.Cable crunches  when I am feeling motivated.Thats the current routine.  Like I said I had to modify SS because of injuries.  I can explain more about my thinking another time if needed. deficit is easy when youre .  And I drink  ounces or so of water each day.  That with the higher volume per calorie foods helps.  The nibbling the soup and a late night snack which is usually just what is leftover from dinner and voila!Chicken turkey lean beef are my go to proteins.  The grocery store near me has really lean chuck sliced thin and a few other cuts of beef that are about the same calories per pound as chicken breast.  I dont being fish because of the smell but otherwise I would.My thinking is to make this as easy as possible.  I dont need a menu of  items.   proteins  carbs whatever veg.  Easy to track.  Easy to prepare.  Easy to duplicate.  This is the foundation of my diet.Since I have already shown that I am prone to getting fat this is how I manage it.  I will have to do so for the rest of my life.But I can still go out to dinner and not worry about what I eat or have pizza for lunch now and then because out of  days each year I am only going off my regular diet  or  times.  Good enough for me.,progresspics,cxs416k,3,t5_2sl0y

6124456,0,t1_cylo761,Thanks man! And it took me around a year and a half. Originally I was eating shitty and drinking beer every night and never worked out a day in my life. So I completely quit drinking started eating grilled things and started working out. I started with doing  minutes a day on the elliptical machine and then moved up to  then  and then finally to an hour. I did that every day and then added visualization techniques and meditation with it. I had to change my self image from being fat and clumsy to being fit and skinny and confident. And I also was only eating fruit for  days a week for a few months,progresspics,cylsc6x,11,t5_2sl0y

7174144,0,t1_d1t03vu,Hes being downvoted because his dismissive and condescending attitude doesnt add to the conversation.Im not a fan of keto fanatics either. Or any kind of fanatic. Ever tried to talk to a vegan about how meat isnt the worst thing since cancer? I can see how they can be annoying. However you have to realize that many of them are overenthusiastic because theyve found keto to work really well after decades of failing to control their weight and health. More than a few were on the brink of diabetes morbidly obese hypertense and a slew of other things you just dont want your doctor to tell you about. For some of us keto gave us back our lives. They are just happy people trying to help others however annoying they might be to some.I have yet to hear from anyone who tried to implement a well formulated ketogenic diet and that had to drop it because it just wouldnt work out. Much more often people fail to implement it correctly run into known issues that are easy to resolve and simply drop it like a hot potato without further research. If I had a dollar for every time someone tells me they felt like shit on day  while failing to keep their electrolyte balance in check Id be retired at the age of . And people on this list include medical professionals who should know better than to not look into a problem before dropping it.Diabetics in particular need to be very careful when drastically dropping their carb intake because they will need to adjust their insulin doses. I wouldnt tell anyone to do this without proper medical supervision. Many diabetics have dropped their medication or drastically reduced their dependency on it after successfully adopting a ketogenic lifestyle.Most everyone else stands to gain from going towards keto. But that does obviously not mean that keto is the only thing that could possibly work. You have to find what works for you and having the right mindset to actually bother and look for what might work for you is the most important part. In the end nobody cares whether or not you are keto or how keto you might be except yourself.Keto isnt easy nor straightforward. It takes a lot of learning to do right. It took me a whole year to finally find my way into it to make it part of my life to learn what I had to learn to not run into issues. Which is why I made a point of linking people to the keto sub where they can read the FAQ and ask questions. Keto is very effective and very much safe if you do it properly. If you fail to do the things you need to do you will run into problems. Most of these problems are known and documented and easy to avoid or solve.As for the science argument there is a metric crap ton of science in support of keto. Some of it pretty darn surprising such as keto perhaps being a potential cure for certain kinds of cancer. Yes seriously. Not quite as well documented yet but its a thing. Research is ongoing. Ive spent months reading research papers about low carb diets. Even the really badly done ones. Its actually really interesting.,progresspics,d1tmsur,3,t5_2sl0y

I havent lost in the last month but the difference is visually there thanks to those monthly numbers and pics.My loss was done in   month chunks with breaks in between.  That first pic is from summer  I believe.Ive always done cico eating only  calories on MFP plus  days of working out one cheat day per month.The first lbs came off with bootcamp in  monthes.The second lbs came off in  months on my own with keto and cardio running and elliptical kettle bell swings and burpees.I gained  back this summer did nothing for a year and I just lost it again through  weeks of keto and a few more weeks at  any calories running and gym weight lifting burpees elliptical etc.  Obviously theres more details but thats the big of it.Edited to say that not a single pound came off without the combination of only eating  calories plus working out.  Nothing melted off I worked hard for it and although Im proud I wish it was easier.  Im not athletic at all and the effort it took takes to work out is incredible.  I have  kids and some women say that chasing baby  around is enough NOT for me.  It sucks and I wish!!,progresspics,d237rdd,3,t5_2sl0y

And how can you negatively judge a healthy fit woman who works hard??You have the right attitude. For me sometimes it got exhausting and at a tough moment in life if some woman gave me shit or some insult it would just ruin my day.

Try to keep your caloric intake at ish or like some people suggested take your tdee and go from there.If you are really interested in optimizing your weight loss through exercise then I would suggest whatever makes you sweat more. Weights is the best but if you want to stick with jogging its also good. Maybe every week increase the distance you jog or the time you jog for quantityquality.Hope this helps ,progresspics,d2pc0zp,-2,t5_2sl0y

I try to stick with  meals a day with limited snacking between them. In the morning for breakfast  between AmAm  I drink a protein shake and have some fruit if its around. For lunch If I cooked dinner the previous night.  ended up being lunch the next day. Usually along the lines of chicken breast with veggies or rice. If I didnt bring any lunch with me and had to eat out. Id almost always get a chicken salad with a light amount of dressing or a wrap of some sorts. ,progresspics,d3hjvod,3,t5_2sl0y

Can you tell that I know someone involved in this aip rubbish? You lost weight because you worked hard at it and reduced your intake vs expenditure.

I said  mos bc thats the time between those pictures but in reality I had tried to train for probably a year or more before the before pic.

I have tons of other pictures but I figured I could add them if anyone wanted to see an old lady go from fatfat to slightly overweight. My original goal was just to get to  the top of a healthy BMI because even that seemed ridiculous. Now Im focused on body fat. According to the Tanita scale Ive gone from  to .. Ive only lost  pounds of muscleLBM so another  or so pounds off should get me where I want to be but Ill know it when I see it.Keto start date . Supervised by a LCHF dietitian at a bariatric practice. Logging and weighing everything have eaten an average of  calories per day since I began  some days  some days . Was super strict on carbs until the last month but now I just stay under g net per day.Lost  pounds in the first  weeks joined a gym and started cardio and lifting a few times a week. Reduced cardio and lifting when I screwed up my shoulders squatting . Stopped lifting two weeks ago when I discovered an epigastric hernia awaiting medical consult. Im old and stupid  dont get old dont act stupid.Ive got odd fat distribution for a woman. I have definition in my legs and arms visible ribs in my upper chest but I hold a lot of fat around my trunkwaistback and in my face and neck. Just in the last  pounds theres been a big difference in my face but my double chin hangs on. Land war in Asia. I think Im a V shape  my shoulders and bust are way bigger than my hips at this point and I dont think that is going to change as I lose more weight. People Ive known for years but only see every few months dont recognize me at this point but most days I feel like I look the same as the first photo. I know I dont but I guess it takes time.ETA I am the queen of the twotothree week stall. I hit a new low weight then go up  pounds over the next few days then bounce between those two numbers for  days then I lose all the water weight plus another  pounds in  days. It is very very frustrating especially lately as the stalls seem to be getting longer. But every four or six weeks I catch up with my predicted losses if only for a day or two before the whole thing starts again. But I reward myself with New Pants Day every time I woosh so that makes it fun. ,progresspics,d4xgp3a,8,t5_2sl0y

Core calisthenic accessory work. If this were a benching day Id do maybe  rounds of steep incline deficit push ups dips shoulder Ypress and planks with a minute jump rope between each exercise.  . Stretch deep for another .After the four month mark I got really stagnant. I started going around twice a week making sure to do a ton of pullup variations each day along with lsits and dips. The aggressive pullup routine really helped my back development. Then since I was working out much more lazily I hit  pounds and started losing a lot of squat strength. That kind of made me want to get really serious. From  months until now is when most of my progress happened. I started a ketogenic diet and got back to lifting  days a week.  weeks ago I started really tracking my macros albeit sometimes Id still go overboard but at least I could see it on paper and following a ketogains lifting protocol  days a week plus my own hiit workout variations on off days. I would say the bulk of the change happened within these past ten weeks. Squat x went from  to  and still climbing. Really really happy with this diet and this program. I hope others can find something that they can really stick to and that works for them. Ultimately the biggest factors in order of importance were  really managing and dialing in diet and  finding a great foundational lifting program and dedicating the time to it. Also stretching is wayyyyy overlooked. Every fourth week no matter what is a recovery and mobility week. Deep stretching and foam rolling. No heavy lifting period. Good joints are the real strength.

8328541,0,t1_d5iku53,I row for my college so when school was in just going to practiceswhich is usually erging and body weight exercises or rowing on the water in the summer Ive been training  times a week at the gym usually  mins of cardio then lifting. I alternate upper bodyDumbbells bench press etc and lower bodysquats mostly lol and throw in core exercises majority of the time. One of my friends from high school has been my gym buddy which has reeeally been helping me to keep going consistently!As for diet I made the most progress when tracking on myfitnesspal it really helped when I got a Fitbit cause you can accurately eat at a cal deficit. I dont really have a specific diet but usually Ill have cottage cheese and fruit for breakfast a protein shake after I workout and then fruit throughout the day until dinner. Not limiting what I ate helped me keep it up as more of a lifestyle change though I still have ice cream and junk occasionally as long as it doesnt go over my allotted calories. Also it helps that Ive been getting into running lately which burns a ton of calories and I am able to eat a little more for the day and end up actually having a larger deficit.I hope this is useful!  ,progresspics,d5imfj8,19,t5_2sl0y

I set out to lose weight because I wanted to compete in powerlifting. I not only want to compete but I want to be great. It doesnt take too much scrolling through Instagram to realize great powerlifters are not obese. I have achieved my goal of dropping to  lb. and can now compete in the  lb. weight class. My immediate goal will be to maintain my weight and train over the next few months to achieve a  lb. raw total in my first powerlifting meet. In the future I will consider phases of bulking and cutting in order to become a leaner  lb. lifter.

However that only took me so far so I decided to also remove soda sugary drinks and unnecessary processed foods from my diet just to see what would happen.

8582293,0,t1_d6e31mp,Sure! I reduced my intake from around  calories a day to  max and that helped me get under the  mark. I got down to  but then I looked really gangly and thin but almost unhealthy. I wish I had taken a picture then but I didnt. That took me about a month and a half. In mid June I basically went pescetarian and cut out bread butter desserts and rice. I always made sure my plate was  to  protein. For example if my main protein was fish I would literally make my plate into a pie chart and make sure visually it was correct. I ate a lot of fresh veggies with just a little olive oil. For dessert I would eat fresh fruit with yogurt if I had a killer sweet tooth. Watching macros to at least some extent is what let me pack on muscle. I committed to using the bodyweight Fitness app made by that subreddit at the beginning of May its free and awesome! and joined a crossfit gym about a month ago so now I do the bodyweight Fitness app when I cant make it to crossfit and do runsbike on Saturdays.When the scale started going up from  I panicked at first until I did a body fat  check with a coach friend of mine I teach high school and saw that the  was going down each week. Thats how I knew I was gaining lean mass. Dont let the scale freak you out.On a side note the biggest thing I cut out was cheat days. It took real commitment. I never cut out beer blood and honey by revolver anyone? but if I knew I was going out or having a drink I would reduce my calorie intake at breakfast to compensate for beer or wine at dinner.I hope that helps!

Best piece of advice I could give you would be to focus on really feeling the muscle contraction when you lift rather than just lifting as heavy as possible with whatever form like I did and youll avoid injuries etc.,progresspics,d7vx3lu,3,t5_2sl0y

9118379,0,t1_d86p1wl,Well alcohol as well and also I just eat  meals a day no snacks in between except for a cuppa tea with some milk if Im feeling it If you keep your meal times fixed and your proportions fixed  eating the right stuff then youre good and your body loves it. Its how we evolved eating and todays typical diet is so out of whack with what our bodies are used to dealing with. Its really no wonder people become overweightobese and isnt our fault that all that junk food shit exists and is fucking addictive. We tend to blame ourselves but its actually designed to be addictive so people buy it. Really difficult to eat properly in line with how were naturally supposed to eat when you have this shithouse food industry making people ill causing cancer and diabetes selling cheap addictive crap. You should read up on the Paleo diet if you dont already know about it cause thats essentially how I eat!! I didnt exercise to lose that weight from kgs and yeah  meals a day fixed proportions of protein vegetables fat and fruit at each meal no fruit at dinner though. Dont want to share too much because its intellectual property of the program I follow but thats it really! The Brightline eating lady Susan Peirce Thompson is a brain scientist she used to be a crack addict then became overweight says that junk food was harder to quit!! and talks all about that stuff so if you have the money to check out the program and will take it seriously then its pretty much priceless information and I definitely recommend it! ,progresspics,d87vqn7,2,t5_2sl0y

9231576,0,t3_56te3n,For anyone who sees thisLeft is around  lbs mostly cardio and light weights was extremely restrictive and undereating. I wish I had ate more previously I was a normal but sort of chubby person so I just wanted the weight to come off and I didnt even see it gone TBH. I was just counting cals not macros. I got underweight that year to under  lbs.Middle is early this year I was bingeing and purging a lot about  days per week workouts were really inconsistent and Id skip them when I would binge. On non binge days I would restrict too much  cals and then end up binging again and gaining back a lot of weight. Weight went up and down a lot but usually never went lower than  and highest was . Right was yesterday at  honestly I think my weight is probably lower considering I had a lot of food in me. Was eating intuitively for the past few weeks mostly around  cals somedays more when I had treats lifting almost everyday plus fasted cardio. As of today cut down cardio and workout split changed to allow better recovery and hit each muscle group more often.Trying to get back on track because I made it  days binge free then recently been messing up this week. My binges are extreme a binge day is usually around kk cals so that is why I really just cant binge I need to stop. I dont want to gain it all back. I took the picture on the right yesterday right after I had binged today I am back on it no more bingeing. Still dont like how I look but eventually hoping I can just accept how I look and get a bit leaner.

Even if I would go just to go on the treadmill for  mins and do a few sets it would get me in the right mindset. I go almost every day.

9461230,0,t3_5a9l2g,Edit I really started getting back to my usual routine back in August when I came back to school. Before that I was running everyday and started plateauing and wasnt getting any benefit out of it. I was around  lbs and frail. The before picture left was taken on August th  and the after picture right was taken on October th . I started going  days a week chestshoulders backcore arms legs with high cardio at the end of every workout. I also jump rope everyday which I can definitely say has led to me having an extremely low body fat. My diet usually consisted of around    calories a day. Usually something protein and carb heavy for breakfast eggs oatmeal bagels with egg whites and cream cheese  builders bars etc. Lunch usually consists of protein heavy foods turkey wraps grilled chicken rice etc. Dinner consists of about the same as lunch would. I usually like to treat myself during the week and got chocolate ice cream with Oreos after a workout or something else delicious.Ive made better results in  months than it took me in years by honestly believing in my routine and that it was working and committing to just eating a little better than I usually would. Also finding a routine that accommodates your body is very important. Ive tried various different programs. My best results have come from not letting my routine and diet consume me and stress me out. PM for any questions.,progresspics,d9fa0i1,6,t5_2sl0y

10465213,0,t1_dcuc6ra,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,progresspics,dcuc6vk,-3,t5_2sl0y

10729412,0,t3_5tcyte,Wow did not think I would get that much of a response. Thank you all so much for all the kind words and the very entertaining responses haha.For those wondering heres the full story I was hitting finals week in college which meant a lot of stressed lastminute studying including consuming lots of junk food. Towards the last three days of finals I basically lived off of Ramen noodles really bad cafeteria pasta hot cheetos and Starbucks. Not the best combo. I usually drink a lot of water regardless but I started slipping towards the last week of finals because I couldnt be bothered to buy water. On the day before my last final I went the whole day basically only eating cereal for breakfast then a LOT of Hot Cheetos and then skipping dinner altogether. As a result I got a massive migraine and my stomach felt like complete hell. Rather than eat something I opted to go to sleep because I had stayed up too late studying. Well I woke up at  AM threw up complete red hot cheeto powder in my dorm bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up again at  AM threw up again then as I was entering my dorm room I felt a sudden head rush and next thing I knew I was lying on the floor with my elbow bleeding like crazy because of course on my way down I had to graze it against the door hinges and my roommate lying over me trying to wake me up and make sure Im okay. tldr Finals week ate junk food for a good week straight. Last day I basically ate hot cheetos more than anything else and hardly drank any water. Next morning after throwing up I passed out from dehydration  migraine  really bad stomach content. Needless to say I dont eat Hot Cheetos as much as I used to. ,progresspics,ddmnq2a,17,t5_2sl0y

Following a diet plan like Keto is arbitrary and what works will vary from person to person. No matter what diet plan you follow you will more than likely have to count calories and macros.

11071060,0,t1_demvbjf,Thank you! And well I was actually around  when we met then I gained a bunch of weight and eventually lost it so the overall change in my body from when we met to now isnt all that massive. Honestly the main effect my weight has had on our relationship over time stems from how my weight affects my selfconfidence. My husband has always been  kind and complimentary even when I was far from traditionally attractive. In fact I cant think of a single instance when he had anything negative to say about my weight or my body period though for a little while there I probably could have used the kick in the ass. What my weight did affect was how I carried myself my enjoyment of being out in public my willingness to put myself out there in various ways etc. My relationship with my husband was loving supportive and a massive positive force in my life at  lbs. and at  lbs. and it still is at  lbs. Whats changed is how I view myself.,progresspics,demw7f8,98,t5_2sl0y

I think I would be at a happier point with my body if I had started lifting at  pounds rather than now..but its still great to see how much just CICO can alter your body. Good luck on your journey! Im so happy I can motivate other people with my own story.  ,progresspics,dfw53wd,2,t5_2sl0y

11586983,0,t3_65dmwl,I posted this on my Instagram along with this caption Before my first run maybe a month ago and before todays run. Its hard to tell sometimes even though the scale is moving the way its supposed to. I got a little emotional on my run today PMS didnt help but not in a bad way. Im just proud of myself. How much I have changed. How much work Ive put in and promises Ive kept to myself. Accomplishing things I never thought I could. If you told me a year ago that I would wake up at am on my ownwith no hangover and eat breakfast and run k before I have to work at  I would just laugh. The more time passes the more I realize how much I was in denial about everything. Especially my own happiness. Today Im truly happy and I feel I really know myself even though I surprise myself at what I can accomplish everyday. PMA always people. It gets you a long way. Good things come to those who work their asses off. Also I saw an albino squirrel which was pretty dope.I got out of a pretty crappy relationship that left me pretty screwed up almost a year ago. Once I started changing my eating drinking and exercise habits I had no idea how much more it would change. My self esteem and confidence is better my anxiety has gone way down I feel all around happier. I believe in myself and I know I can achieve so much. I guess this really is about more than weight loss. ,progresspics,dg9e460,20,t5_2sl0y

11600279,0,t1_dgavdn8,So far just tracking calories with MFP. I just transferred to a university so I decided to change up my diet. I set MFP to a  calorie deficit to lose lbweek but with all the walking I do around campus its closer to lbs a week. Too busy to hit the gym often but I plan on doing some lifting over the summer ,progresspics,dgawfcg,7,t5_2sl0y
11607611,0,t3_65kton,Brother nice work you look fit as fuck now.    I am about the same weight as you arealtho a bit shorter. I was wondering did you start weightlifting immediately? Or did you have a cutting period like for the first couple of months? Thanks hope you get to read this man.,progresspics,dgbqduz,2,t5_2sl0y
11609125,0,t1_dgbug3i,Thanks. Its not always just about looks but when you feel better about yourself you personality will change to someone who is more confident and happy and thatll come across to other people.,progresspics,dgbwklx,2,t5_2sl0y
11615388,1,t1_dgciwsp,Isnt that just the default weight loss strategy though? I thought everybody knew that the way to lose fat was to consume less than you expend. CICO is just a basic fact of biology. The hard part is figuring out a way to do CICO without going hungry giving in to cravings binging etc.,progresspics,dgcm4o0,5,t5_2sl0y

11642003,0,t1_dgfliqh,Just started running again yesterday  days after to do the same. I tried minor lightweight lb abductions as well and couldnt quite reach  degrees yet painfree. Hoping you and the docs are right about PT. First time without it was about  months before I could start lifting anything lol.Any suggestions on some of those activities? I think thats what Im most frustrated with right now. Feeling like theres nothing I can do besides run and leg and core exercises. ,progresspics,dgfmuv8,1,t5_2sl0y

11748139,0,t1_dgrfbav,You might want to go lower or recomp at . Without having a front view I have no idea how broad your shoulders are which determines how much weight you can carry. Your goal of  seems reasonable if you have a large frame and are strong. Otherwise if you want the aesthetic look you probably will want to go lower.For background Im   and my goal weight is  but right now my abs are coming in. At  pounds out my stomach was flat. At  pounds out I started to see my upper abs. Im built like a linebacker if that helps broad shoulders and strong legs.,progresspics,dgroiti,2,t5_2sl0y
11750353,0,t1_dgrvpdd,Ok thats what I figured...interesting. Do you chalk that up to your body going into starvation mode? I know Ive gone WAY below a few days here and there...but thats mostly unintentional due to medication sideeffects and being busy. Ill definitely keep that in mind...although I dont think I would ever intentionally go that low. My TDEE is something like  so  would be...bad oStill...point taken. ,progresspics,dgrxk8o,2,t5_2sl0y
