You understand that the bible isnt the end all be all book for Christianity to be maintained and you stick with what you believe.Honestly I wish more people would at least have the same fundamentals as you. You are the last person Id suspect to speak out against scientists or try and take down abortion clinics. I like your style and appreciate your ability to handle the debate. Even with an opponent who is a little rash in their responses. ,SubredditsMeet,culh4w4,2,t5_39rdk

5279855,0,t3_3nb440,gtIs MegaEvolution a rip off of Digivolution?Why should it? The concept of a temporary poweruptransformation isnt anything Digimon has invented its just something it used a lot  in the anime evolutions in most games are permanent.  Maybe Pokmon got inspired by the evolution mechanics of Digimon just like Digimon may get inspired by certain aspects of Pokmon but that doesnt make them rip offs of each other considering how different they actually are.gtWould a Digimon game with Pokmon mechanics work well?No. Sadly they tried though  The core concepts of both franchises are just too different.  Pokmon takes role in a fantasy world in which Pokmon haven taken the place of what wed call animals. They built a lore around that so that everything in this world e.g. Pokmon fighting for the fun of humans is normal for the people who live in that world.  The player is now dropped into the world as a nobody. He is not seeking to be the hero but to be the very best like no one ever was. Ofc. you have a bit of story in the game but essentially there is not much difference between the player and a random guy on Route . Which is why Pokmon Go will probably work  Digimon on the other hand takes place in an alternate version of our real world in which a virtual world exists within the computer network of earth that is inhabited by sentient intelligent and communicative beings. The protagonists are usually dropped into this world being unfamiliar with the its rules and lore and being a foreign body in there. This makes the protagonists special within the world which is usually expressed by them saving one or both worlds gt them being the hero.  A good game for both franchises therefore requires different designs. Pokmon runs well with what theyre done all the time.   Digimon has been experimenting quite a bit in all those years and they havent really for the Digimon formula yet. Digimon World  and ReDigitize are nice games next rder looks awesome and Im curious about Cyber Sleuth.  But putting Pokmon mechanics into a Digimon scenario would be horrible. Digimon are no animals theyre persons like you and me. Letting them fight for our amusement is already bad enough with animals but with people it becomes even worse... And most and for all... You cant compete with Pokmon by copying its mechanics.gtWould you rather be a Pokmon trainer or a digimon tamer?I have no desire to be a Digimon Tamer but Id rather meet Digimon than Pokmon.  Discovering Digimon is basically the same a discovering intelligent life in outer space and hell yeah Im in for it  Id just never dare to see me as their mastertrainertamer but rather as a friend.  Other than that we have Pokmon Go coming which is probably the closest we ever get to real Pokmon unless some mad scientist does some genetic engineering.  Fun fact most things about Digimon are technically possible or already exist. Virtual Worlds gt Game Worlds. Digimon gt AIs. Its not a question whether its possible but only when it happens.gt Is there a reason you prefer one over the other or was it just the first one you saw?If I had to decide Id pick Digimon over Pokmon.  The Digimon anime not only created a deep world characters and story that I could experience over and over again but it also helped me a lot to become the person Im.  When I started getting back into Digimon about a year ago I used this chance to observe myself and to watch it in an analytical way. I was quite amazed by how much my person got influenced by Digimon and learned a lot about myself.  Not to forget that I as a software developer find the idea of intelligent digital lifeforms fascinating.And Digimon has Gabumon a character Id really like to meet as he is probably one of the  main reasons I havent gone madsuicidal in my life. If you wonder about the other reason its a good friend I made  ironically through Pokmon.gt Which brand has the better anime?Im not up to date about the Pokmon Anime but if they created anything as amazing as Digimon Adventures or Digimon Tamers then wow.As a note my opinion about the Digimon Anime is based upon the german dub and the original subbed. If youve only watched the US dub youve seen a different Anime than me.gt Which world has the better police enforcement healthcare and general civilization?Well the digimon world is literally our world and Pokmon is a idealized fantasy world. Id say comparing them for the aspects of civilization makes no sense. Especially if you consider that Digimon has no unified lorecanon you could compare it against.But Pokmon lets animals fight each other for their amusement. So much for civilization. Pgt Which one has the most irresponsible parents?Pokmon. The parents in Digimon usually have no power over what their children are doing as theyre either unaware of the adventures of the children either because the children are hiding it or because it startedhappened without the parents having a chance to influence it.  And when they are aware they usually share their concerns but you cant stop someone who is actually the only one who can save your world even if you want to.gt Which Pokemon is a total rip off of a Digimon design and viceversa?Well many designs of Pokmon and Digimon are rip offs of existing animals or mythical creatures.  Other than that I cant recall any total rip offs...Edit Formatting...,SubredditsMeet,cvmk9bk,6,t5_39rdk

However I feel the DS lineup should have contained the GB name and then the DS would do so from there.gt What series from the gameboy line of systems do you feel should have made the jump to the DS?Definitely Golden Sun and Advance Wars. Also wouldnt mind another Fire Emblem in the world of Magvel as Magvel was only explored in Sacred Stones.gt What are some pros and cons of the Gameboy?Pros Portable Durable Great Library.Cons Green and Black initially always seemed to be behind competitors and home consoles.gt What are some pros and cons of the DS?Pros Great Library Lots of Applications Portable Glasses Free dCons Low Battery Life Easily Broken in Some Games SSB for Circle Pads as an Example D can give headaches Can be turned off howevergt What is your favorite game on the DSSuper Smash Bros Ita a marvel that a game as complex as Smash is even playable on a handheld let alone competently made with all the fun of its console counterpart.gt What is your favorite game on the Game BoyMy favorite game from the Game Boy family has got to be Fire Emblem. Its one of my favorite games... EVER! Its tense exciting with deep complexities engaging permadeath weapon durability the lot. IMO the best Fire Emblem game hands down However Sacred Stones does come close!,SubredditsMeet,cwba1mt,0,t5_39rdk
5924542,0,t1_cxw8da2,Overwatch wont die for a long time. Lets use  years as a rough time estimate  Even if it has a shit reception it will still hold on for years. Blizzard doesnt abandon games that often. Diablo  was PANNED  years ago but it got fixed with an expansion pack. A large free patch is scheduled for later this year even.  TF will also not die unless Valve actively tries to kill it. It has a great reputation and a rejuvenating player base. The numbers might shrink but not by a sizable amount and it wont go near collapse levels.  ,SubredditsMeet,cxw8lr6,5,t5_39rdk
