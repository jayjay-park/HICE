Aside from whats happening in America its an issue all over. Indian farmers are going bankrupt drilling deeper. Youre the guy with your head in the sand and it cant happen here mentality. You wont last long when it happens. ,Survivalist,cofkrrh,-1,t5_2qoov

5717545,0,t3_3tdid7,For anyone considering this For a participantThe survival part of this show is very real.  Yes you have access to medical treatment if you request it or if the production feels the need to intervene  but as a participant you really will be trying to survive for  days..  there is no break or staying in a hotel over night Bear Grylls style.  Its not uncommon for the participants on this show to be hospitalized for many weeks or even months after filming.  From this aspect of the show  surviving off your wits and skills this is the real deal.  Your partner is your partner.  If you get along your chances of success are much greater if not.. well.  It is not scripted at all the survival bit of the show From the viewers perspective  What we see after the editing is real in the sense that what happened really happened  but it may not have happened in the chronological order of how it played out in real life if that makes sense.With that said  the producers do not script or manipulate or create drama where there is none.  The only thing forced is when the contestants have to make their little daily journal.. what they say is up to them..but they HAVE to say something.EDITED TO ADD  Forgot this part.  Again from the viewers perspective.  Going back to the editing of the show  some of the fighting or bickering  while it truly did happen might be edited in a way to make it look like a bigger deal than it really is.. same anything you see.  Someone hunting or making shelter could be edited in a way that doesnt reflect how it actually happened  but it did happen.  If the participant made fire or clubbed a walrus and ate it raw  she really made fire or ate that walrus.  While I am not a fan of the show and I HATE scripted reality shows... but I have done video editing... I can somewhat understand the need  desire of the production company to edit in such a way that it tells a story.. if it was just broadcast as raw chronological order of events.. it just wouldnt work.  This is shot over  days with multiple cameras.. and they have  minutes per episode to tell the story.  Not saying its right  just how it is.TLDR  If you are considering this just know you will really have to survive on your own.  This show isnt fake or scripted.Source I knew a girl that was on the show.  It took her more than  months to recover afterwards.  Her partner was hospitalized for  weeks after.EDITED forgot to talk about some editing magic  read above,Survivalist,cx5tfvd,3,t5_2qoov
