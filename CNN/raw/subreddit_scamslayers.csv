3285390,0,t1_cp2rd2p,I have no official word on this as of yet but if this sub is allowed to do what it wants to it will have to be done through that way. For example links posting to notes.com that clearly show a valid scammers number will be allowed. Again this is not official as of yet so please dont submit any of those types of links yet. Thank you for understanding.Edit It is official you CAN post scammers numbers using offsite hosts such as notes.com ,scamslayers,cp2refc,2,t5_37960

However in this case you have the guy on the phone. Theres a good chance if your PD got involved they could trace a call you make to him and contact the local PD there. Ive never heard of them being stupid enough to give a phone number. ,scamslayers,cuk01gz,1,t5_37960
