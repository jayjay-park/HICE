5480391,0,t3_3pif70,Just downloaded it and listened to it!  Ive never seen the movie and just listened to it like a podcast which was a weird experience but I still enjoyed the commentary on it.  Ill have to watch the movie and play it like a commentary track like I was supposed to. When I hit download I got an .MP file video as well.  Ive never heard of Gumroad would Bandcamp work better for something like this?  I know you get a bunch of different download options but I think you have to upload it as a .FLAC or something. Do you guys have any movies planned for the future or are you going to take suggestions like you do for WEE?,worstepisodeever,cwc66e8,1,t5_39kkb

8327189,0,t1_d5h7ugw,Agreed! Besides Benders Big Score my favorite of them Ive only seen them all once. I really enjoy them all and I like how they are all thematically different from one another. Beast With a Billion Backs was my least favorite but I REALLY need to rewatch it ,worstepisodeever,d5igc52,1,t5_39kkb

8623534,0,t3_4xsh6l,I know that Hulu is doing the weekly releases for their original content unlike Netflix and Amazon. I feel like they havent caught on but Im not sure if its because they lose steam by not being released all at once or theyre just not of great quality.I agree with the talk of determining whether or not a show should be released all at once or weekly based on the cohesion of the story. I know a lot of reviewers myself included have trouble covering these types of shows. Once would think you want to do it episodically and pad it out to get more conversation. But if youre finishing up covering a  episode season two weeks later your readerslisteners will have most likely tuned out by then since they finished it up when it first dropped.,worstepisodeever,d6jjksp,1,t5_39kkb

11355614,0,t1_dfj1h58,I guess what I consider streaming is something that I can stream without paying extra. So if its on Netflix or Hulu its streaming but if I have to rent it from Amazon or YouTube or iTunes like Rogue One right now its not streaming,worstepisodeever,dfj4z5j,1,t5_39kkb

11765548,0,t3_67rn1k,I have so many questions but the big one is simply Why? I know that The Simpsons has done specific presidential commentary in the past Two Bad Neighbors Citizen Kang that voting machine segment in one Treehouse of Horror. They even did that other really strange  A.M. short where the show threw its support behind Hillary. But The Simpsons is not one of those shows that needs to rely on current political commentary in order to stay at the top of the newsfeed why do this? They failed doubly for both going against the tone of their show and for being a really sloppy and unfunny parody.Also the Spicer joke was absolutely Family Guy territory. I know its probably been talked about a couple of times but Im worried about modern Simpsons sometimes for feeling like they need to push the envelope and adjust their jokes to reference what would be consider darker now than it was in the s.,worstepisodeever,dgtnl7x,2,t5_39kkb
11768774,0,t1_dgty47w,This is a great point I regret missing  I think it was the same two guys who did Grimes and theyre on record saying its not at all a political episode Bush is just an arbitrary well thats weird choice for this placeholder enemy character. So glad you pointed this out. ,worstepisodeever,dgu0s36,7,t5_39kkb
