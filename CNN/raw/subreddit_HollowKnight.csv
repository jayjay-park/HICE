But before I joined the beta I would get a couple of stutters a minute which made the game very frustrating to play. Since the beta I only get a stutter every couple of minutes now. Something else that helped me was turning ON vsync. Because the stutters are ultimately caused by  cpu spikes turning on vsync lowered my cpu usage from  to  and has seemingly helped.,HollowKnight,deojphq,1,t5_35gpe
