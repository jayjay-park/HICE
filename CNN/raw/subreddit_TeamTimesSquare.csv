6167966,0,t3_401nc8,Hi Gabe  Im really looking forward to taking part in this with you and everyone else on this Team My name is Faiza  Im  and this is going to be my first ever challenge and hopefully my last.My highest weight was lb and now Im at my lowest weight of lb. I was motivated to join this challenge because of nursing school which im starting fall of this year fingers crossed and just wanted to start on a good note.As of any suggestion  I would say a weekly login where people talk about what they did good during the week that they feel like would be helpful to share would be great. ,TeamTimesSquare,cyqqffh,7,t5_3bqwl
6213930,0,t3_40ng16,I have a question do I have to be an active commenter in this sub? Because I dont have nearly enough bubbliness most of you seem to have.If I dont great Ill do my part as in lose the weight as I already said in the introduction thread. I just feel a hell of a lot more comfortable lurking around than writing stuff.,TeamTimesSquare,cyvygk2,5,t5_3bqwl
6223258,0,t1_cywwran,Youre welcome! I believe they have quite a few videos focused on flexibility but if thats your main goal any of the stretchingyoga ones will do. Enjoy  ,TeamTimesSquare,cyx0mez,1,t5_3bqwl
6238102,0,t3_401nc8,Hi everyone! This is my first challenge and Im really really excited about it. Ive been overweightobese for pretty much my entire life and after a lot of false starts on my weight loss journey Ive decided I really want to crack down and commit to this. Im f hovering at around lbs right now. Ideally Id like to get down to  over the course of the challenge even if that might be a bit ambitious. Ive been logging everything in MFP religiously for the past week or so and have been making a point to get in some exercise every day even if its just walking around the block for a while so at least Im off to a good start!Again Im super excited about this challenge. I think my biggest problem is not holding myself accountable and not being honest with myself about whats workingwhats not so Im looking forward to the support Ill get from this more than anything. Good luck to everyone! ,TeamTimesSquare,cyypdrb,1,t5_3bqwl
