559809,0,t1_cg3qt1k,I got instate residency after a year but my whole family was living in NC for my first year of college.If your main reason for moving to NC is to attend college then they probably will not grant you instate residency.According to this ncsu webpage the basic requirements to meet residency aregt establishment of domicile legal residence and physical presence in North Carolina for at least  monthsgt residence has been maintained for at least  continuous months prior to the start of the termgt intent to make North Carolina a permanent home of indefinite durationgt evidence supporting that one is not in the state solely for the purpose of attending an institution of higher educationThey also say that the primary indicator of where you live is determined by where your parents live.gtUnder NC statute G. S.  the legal residence of an individuals living parents or legal guardian is prima facie evidence of the individuals legal residence. This means that the legal residence of the applicant is considered the same as that of his or her living parents or legal guardian. That prima facie evidence may be rebutted or reinforced by other evidence relative to the applicants age and general circumstances. Generally speaking for an applicant with outofstate parents the older the applicant and more independent the applicant is from his or her parents the more likely it is for the applicant to be able to demonstrate domicile in North Carolina.,NCSU,cg3wnlx,1,t5_2qsbo

789021,0,t1_cgtw3n4,Its just little things that add up. As students the  reason this place should exist they sure do make us work to get the most out of what we pay. My biggest peeves are around athletics the gym and little nickel and dime things they get you for.  We are a first rate university and our mypack website is utter shit. We have no way to get something  students and their parents use at least  times a year to work like a website in the year  should? Athletics. Let your damn students have easier access to tickets. Especially football season and mens basketball. Oh no you dont make as much money off the football game by letting more of your studentsfuture alumni go? Thats a very short term style of thinking. And once youre in they treat us like poorly behaved cattle. The event staff is almost as heartless as the parking enforcement on campus. Oh no you go through the line beside your buddy on the way in? Congrats you may be in opposite endzones. And no they dont usually give a shit. Girlfriend from out of town want to come to the game? Thatll be  dollars. Oh its a game you actually wish to go to? Sorry none available. And god forbid the game is on Thursday night and we have a decent season. Some teachers will threaten with double absence if you miss a class to tailgate or attend the game. Mens basketball the seating for students has just gone haywire. I dont even understand the new method of seating upon entry. They just want to have complete control and maximize profits. Camping out for UNC tickets that sounds fun. If you like being forced to stay up all night no drinking no fires in the midst of winter sleeping on the gym floor or asphalt outside. Just call it what it is field day for students just like we had in elementary school once or twice a year. Let us pitch a tent and duke it out for some chapel hill tix. At the gym they show you alllll these facilities and courts you can use whenever you want. The best window is before lunch on sunny days. Otherwise classes are occupying them a handful of fellas playing basketball will claim them or club teams will be practicing. Ive been run off the tennis courts for use by the club team. That just doesnt seem right. The cost of meal plans and the breakfastlunchdinner meal allowances covered under a meal equivalency just about come close to the exorbitant cost of a meal at the new tally or atrium. This results in you having to always keep an eye on your dining dollars or debit account which you pull from when the cost of a single entree exceeds what the university dining says your lunch is worth. The employees there seem like its their first day slapping some meat on bread waiting until they get off to light up that first black n mild. Until you try to refill a drink or water. Then theyre the most attentive and proactive person to ever work a fast food restaurant. Dining halls theyve stepped up a bit. You find a routine and go for the good meals. I like it but Im not a picky eater. Probably a lot of half constructed ideas here. Anyone else wish to weigh in please do so. Im outside fingers are cold. Gotta blast. ,NCSU,cgtyrx5,9,t5_2qsbo
878114,0,t1_ch3wpm4,Unless you go to the dining hall you have to pay the same as everyone else. There isnt really a dining hall on centennial just a place to use dining dollars which is really just money on your account. You use your account money instead of real money. You just pay the money on your account before the semester and not when you about to eat the food. Dining halls are different because they are based off of meals and you get x number of meals based on the plan. The dining hall food is good for about  weeks then you start to hate it. It becomes the same monotonous food that is okay but not that great.If you want to save money take the bus or walk to food lion. Its about a  minute walk from Wolf Village. Wolf Village apartments all have kitchens too so you really shouldnt pass up on cheap home made food even if its ramen.,NCSU,ch43fnb,2,t5_2qsbo

5767230,0,t3_3u433k,Huh I wonder how much response bias comes into play. With only  of selected students taking the poll it may seem that students who feel a certain way would be less likely to respond at all. I was also confused as to why a higher percentage of black students were purposefully selected. I understand there was supposed to be a comparison but painting an accurate picture of the whole student body seems more important.One other thing I was a little put off by was the wording of the questions as well. For one there were two options for supporting allowing refugees and only one option for not. It seems a little biased to set the options this way. The option for not allowing refugees was also lead with the phrase given current conditions. No other options were led this way and it might sway some people against choosing it. Seeing that part of the phrase associated it at least for me with islamaphobia which may not be the only reason someone would want to prevent refugees.Personally I support them coming however I wanted to point out some things I saw in the analysis that might skew the data to make us seem more tolerant and liberal as one would expect a college campus. Personally I see state as generally moderate.,NCSU,cxbz7s1,9,t5_2qsbo
5795906,0,t3_3ujuhg,Do you have an academic advisor in the engineering department? They would be your best resource on this especially since you are double majoring. Typically you have to establish one major as your primary major then add the second one on at a later date basically youll have to CODA into each one respectively. The ESS score is the main factor in the CODA process but some majors will take into account your total GPA. This is usually listed with the departments CODA requirements that should be in your E information packet on the COE website or even my pack along with the typical ESS and GPAs of students accepted into the department.As far as your schedule next semester if you havent already done so you need to talk to your advisor about it. Depending on the program some classes may only be taught either fall or the sprig semesters. So missing an entrylevel engineering class has the potential to push your degree plan back an entire year but you can move GEPs like economics around to keep your course load a little lighter.  ,NCSU,cxfjc23,3,t5_2qsbo

9868736,0,t3_5gmyhj,I did ECE.Classes are pretty good. They are challenging for sure but that is to be expected. There are tons of classes to choose from in different specialization areas so you are never struggling to choose what to take.The biggest issue I had personally is that there are a ton of core classes you have to take in a very diverse range of areas. So regardless of what you want to end up doing you have to take both circuits classes you have to take electromagnetics you have to take assembly and C programming you have to take digital logic etc. Depending on what you want to end up doing this may irritate you. As someone who was more interested in programming really the CPE degree I didnt really care much for taking EampM for example. But it does give you a nice diverse foundation to build on.Faculty is also very good for the most part but of course  there are going to be a few faculty members who arent very good.Research opportunities are eh. Its a big department that gets most of their grad students from international universities with mainly international faculty so I think that inhibits undergrad research. But the opportunities are there if you try for it. I personally did research for two different professors as an undergrad.Job outlook for EEs are fantastic. Plenty of opportunities in whatever are you decide to go in from my experience. I think a huge trend in the industry right now is a shift away from hardware to software so software jobs are abound.In my opinion you need to decide what you really want to do. There is obviously a lot of overlap between EEs and AEs in various fields but for the most part the EE curriculum is completely different from the AE curriculum. Apart from a controls course and a couple of mechatronics course there isnt a whole lot of controlsrobotics in the department although Im not sure what the case is for AE.
