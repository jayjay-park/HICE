The diagnosis process can be long sometimes and often requires an intensive eval and shit depending on what you might have. My psychiatrist does this thing where she hints to me that she thinks I have OCD and prescribes me meds that are often given to those diagnosed with it because I havent been able to see a professional long enough or get an assessmentevaluation. Maybe ask your psychiatrist about an assessment? A lot of the time schizophrenia has to do with specific neurological factors to my knowledge regarding dopamine levels and overstimulation ,mentalillness,decx06e,1,t5_2qwyh
