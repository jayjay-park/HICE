You want other people that randomly find this to play it youll need more screenshots.Also you might want to invest some time in better logographic skills. You also need to put how to play it and as the other user stated being able to jump more the more you tap on a certain direction. That wouldve been helpful to know.Its alright to create the game for experience but I wouldnt say its fun. You might want to add better effects down the road such as animated lava the character turning left or right the rocks slowly disappearingfading away or sinking into the lava. Also a better logo. ,spritekit,dczbc1d,1,t5_2y28u
