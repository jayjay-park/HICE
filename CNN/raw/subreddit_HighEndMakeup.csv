3484315,0,t3_30630a,I buy way more lipsticks and eyeshadow quads than I think I can use. Im definitely a neutral fiend! I love neutrals. But my mustbuy products are definitely based on formula. It the formula is good and the color right Ill buy it. For the right color Id even go down to a weaker formula. Im not a collectionist though. I only try to buy colors and products Ill use so Im perfectly okay with only having one item from a collection. ,HighEndMakeup,cppfqq1,2,t5_33ltq
3651448,0,t1_cq4kteo,Ive been trying to pan some other items so I havent had a chance to form strong opinions on my RBR yet. The lipstick is the one Ive used the most but Im not sure my recommendation means much because they just switched to a new formula. Thats why its shown up on Hautelook a few times. The most I can say now is Im pleased with my purchases but I dont know how RBR stacks up against other high end products.,HighEndMakeup,cq8hpvk,2,t5_33ltq
3696220,0,t1_cqdil5l,Im sad about that  I really wanted a very cool toned one! Maybe one that went more with Dim Light rather than radiant. Or even a Mood Light Bronzer. ,HighEndMakeup,cqdldu7,1,t5_33ltq
