1352565,0,t1_cilfke8,I learned to embrace PLUR everyday of my life  especially after I wake up  just makes my day happier.  Yeah  its great.  At the end of the festival I was sitting on the grass and this guy sat next to me and said everytime I see people with a lot of kandi i just like to say hello because they always give me good vibes  so I did gave him one and he left after a while  when i was leaving we pumped into each other and he gave me a hug and thats probably the last time Ill see that kid  but it always means something because you dont experience it everyday of your life.  How was EDC?  I heard mixed things about it.  I want to go next year... ,kandi,cilu33r,2,t5_2tkqm

2743465,0,t1_cnfcl3j,I looked at a pattern for a skull mask of the same size for the shape of the base and referenced a cuff for the zigzag pattern. The nubs were inspired by a tiny top hat I once made I just kind of winged the shape of those and attached them afterwards.It certainly took lots of patience and good vibes but it has to be my favorite creation so far. Id love to trade one for something or talk more at length about the whole process. Feel free to pm me ,kandi,cnfx5bq,1,t5_2tkqm

2866064,0,t1_cnth5fk,I definitely have to arrange a bit it to get it to look all symmetrical like that I used . mm stretchy cord and pulled it super tight. It holds pretty okay but if you accidentally squish it it gets somewhat funky. Even then it looks okay at a glance though I feel o,kandi,cntvesx,2,t5_2tkqm
3068812,0,t3_2vae2o,When you get to the end of one row usually every two or three rows I think  you need to loop the string back the side you start from should always loo like .....   being the beads that stick up  being spaces.  String through the first  put the next bead in the space.  I think thats the problem youre having.Took me forever to figure that out ,kandi,cog2ujl,1,t5_2tkqm
