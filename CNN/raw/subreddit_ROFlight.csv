436335,0,t1_cfpk2i7,Hmm... over in the RoF Forums its the rd post it sounds different. Or I dont understand you correctly.It seems that when you have an existing RoF Account and use this one with your Steam Version you will only see the content you bought outside of Steam. To use your Steam content you will have to create a new Account.But if it is like you say would the best approach for a Newcomer like me to first create an Account at the RoF Site to get access to the free content those  planes and  map I think? and then use the same Account on Steam so I can have the Free content and the Channel Battles content under one account?Sorry for asking dumb questions. I wished it was as easy as with DCS ,ROFlight,cfpzowi,1,t5_2wr3k
