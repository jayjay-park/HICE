442602,0,t3_1z1vj3,Dont think of marvering as rolling the glass on the marver. You are not pushing a round gob of hot glass across the surface and letting  the pipe roll you are turning the pipe and touching the glass to the surface. Focus on the turning while touching the portion of the piece that you wish to cool to the marver. You can hold the piece in one place or let the piece roll across the surface as you turn but you are matching the rolling to your turning not the other way around. Other than that learn to marver in both directions early on. Keep the wrist of your back hand above the pipe when turning in your natural direction but drop that wrist below the pipe when reversing. ,glassblowing,cfqn2iu,3,t5_2sv90

3567642,0,t1_cpym1nc,Good idea but I didnt do this one like that.  I actually tried that a few weeks ago with a transparent yellow directly over and transparent gold ruby just to see what would happen.... It actually turned my yellow opaque and created a black line all the way around where the  colors meet but other than that nothing fun happened like i was hoping for.,glassblowing,cpyxs2h,1,t5_2sv90

But its complete and utterly worth it if you are driven enough to push through. Im  and coming up to my th year of trying to make this life work.  Its not easy and Im broke af  but things are slowly starting to pay off and if it didnt you couldnt get me to stop. ,glassblowing,d2dfv56,2,t5_2sv90
