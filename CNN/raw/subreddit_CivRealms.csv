91807,0,t1_ceov2y3,We have the same exact set up as we have always have. We have had as many as  players logged into the server with no lag.  I am not going to dispute what you experienced.  I can tell you that the server hardware information that jp gave you is in fact correct and has not changed since we started this server.Like you I too am very interested in finding out what the source of this problem is as from what we can see on our end is not being caused by the server its self.,CivRealms,ceovqq9,1,t5_2x3zt

182614,0,t3_1w5p57,Just to make this perfectly clear ROM did not delete your post. The only moderator here going haywire and rampaging was redacted. I am not exactly willing to have ROM stand up for that clusterfuck of censorship that redacted wipped out. Even my posts were deleted. And I AM a goddamn moderator of this subreddit.Edit I removed some parts since some people feel harrassed by calling them out by name.,CivRealms,cez8izr,5,t5_2x3zt

374825,0,t1_cfixed8,You say casual like its a bad thing I just hate the idea of lives and dont see why we should be making things impossible for people just because things arent hard enough for you and person.  Also I dont agree progress cant be made without new biomes and therefore a server reset.  As for exp I was simply suggesting ideas that would make prot grinding harder.  I havent heard an idea yet about exp that requires cooperation to get.  The base game we are building off of isnt geared towards total cooperation in all aspects and it is silly to believe we can force such a thing on every aspect. And lets not lie to ourselves there are MANY ways around antiafk plugins.Addition I am not resistant to these changes because they would be inconvenient but because these are permanent changes we are talking about and I am not willing to jump into something that will give me no foreseeable improvements over how things are now.  Many of these changes can be done without a server reset.  Also consider this to make a new map will take time.  We cant just all agree today and have the server tomorrow.  We dont have the numbers to survive the down period transition.,CivRealms,cfjm6d4,1,t5_2x3zt
