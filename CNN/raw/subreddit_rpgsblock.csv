6785712,0,t1_d0lf0fb,Cause NOTHING HAPPENS out here! Were in the middle of some random woods that EVERYONE gets lost in and no one wants to visit. Last night I got the first chance to hang out in ALMOST A MONTH... I came home at  because I never get to have fun out here. I we werent doing anything bad down by the soccer field we were just hanging out. And I wanted to savor that for as long as possible... even if it meant getting in trouble. You wondered why I jumped at moving out so quickly? Its because I want to live in an actual neighborhood with actual people within walking distance... I ... Sorry its just being out in the woods being secluded its the worst. ,rpgsblock,d0lg3yu,1,t5_3cvyc

It was all an important life lesson about how the flower power of trodding on bad guys and being shiny and happy was in her all along. Being a Flower Princess was more about a crown. It was about actions and love and harmony and acrobatic fucking pirouettes right up on enemy bonces. She stuck to her plan trying to glide past the enemies faster to give them less of a chance to hit her.,rpgsblock,d64xdet,1,t5_3cvyc

This wont be the last time youll find yourself alone nor will it be the worst.Advice given to you not so long ago though it feels like an eternity rings through your head Try not to push people away when that happens.
