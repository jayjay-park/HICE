1907713,0,t1_ckfi2a2,idk eve was down to ride in this issue.  when mark looks at her she is basically like go sending him to a v against robots drones bc the viltrumites were wetting the bed.,Invincible,ckj2fpj,1,t5_2srew
1946307,0,t1_ckkzh7a,I think I can top you.... I just got all  Volumes of Invincible plus Atom Eve and Rex Splode Volume for . with shipping on eBay. I did the math and with taxes its roughly  retail. ,Invincible,cknqdbv,3,t5_2srew
3161529,0,t3_2wc49l,Did anyone else find this issue to be funnier than others? Maybe its just because of all the goodbyes and old friends but I laughed out loud several times. I loved the background comic book store and movie theater stuff. Sex Perverts Anger Man Interspacer Rockey Raccoon and Golum Rises all made me laugh. They may have laid it on a little thick in the beginning explaining their own changes and delays but it was still funny.Overall Im very excited for whats to come. Especially seeing Allen and Oliver again with what is hopefully a glorious Viltrumite mustache!,Invincible,copovoi,5,t5_2srew
7054617,0,t3_4b60yu,There was a mention of Kirkman being interested in an anime styled adaptation of Invincible in a letterhack many years ago but only that hed be open to the idea if approached. Only way to do Invincible any justice would be a TV series based on it. A stand alone or even trilogy of live action wouldnt be able to capture enough of the charm. Definitely animated too. I dont think itll ever happen though... call me cynical but I just dont see any network  or even netflixhuluamazon prime TV  wanting to pick it up.,Invincible,d1g009c,3,t5_2srew
7063998,0,t1_d1ahezx,Yeah I dont know what happened but his Allen and Nolan Adventures issues didnt look this bad. Imagine if Kirkman had gotten Francis Manapul to do the filler issues D,Invincible,d1h2diq,2,t5_2srew

8717038,0,t1_d6v8zzh,Unhinged Eve is probably the most powerful person in the universe. However when shes in that state she also doesnt think rationally which could be to the advantage of the Viltrumites. ,Invincible,d6v9oqa,5,t5_2srew

9478028,0,t1_d9h8ffj,Come on everyone has a few common words that they misspell on a regular basis. Mine was weird for the longest time. I would write wierd. I knew it was wrong but every single time I would first write it that way. Definitive isnt exactly a common word. Its actually ranked as the th most frequent word according to Googles statistics of over  billion words. And if youve never seen another typo in a published comic youre either not paying attention not buying single issues typos are often fixed for trades or straight up lying. ,Invincible,d9hddds,4,t5_2srew
