4569191,0,t1_ct662sz,Its not great to use but you could try eyelid glue or eyelid tape. Eye skin is really delicate so I dont recommend using it for more than just days where you really wanna rock a strong liner look but its crazy how much of a difference it can make!,HoodedEyes,ct6k43r,1,t5_2zol8

8570047,0,t1_d6c4pxx,Im in love with that Maybelline mascara. Its got a teeny brush on one end which youre supposed to use for your lower lashes but I use it on my top lashes to get good separation before I use the big brush. Guerlain Maxi Lash used to be my HG but I dont even miss it anymore. ,HoodedEyes,d6cu5io,1,t5_2zol8
8614203,0,t3_4xr4u8,Your hooded eyes remind me of Asian double eyelids so maybe try looking up tutorials for that? Im Chinese and my eyes look a lot like yours.
