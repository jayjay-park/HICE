4412763,0,t3_3bkd7x,I just wanted to say thanks for discovering this subreddit and for posting!Sadly I think theres a lot of reason to think that Terry had to leave the game for a family emergency.

5322705,0,t3_3nx2i0,Interesting. But I just cant imagine a scenario where Kimmi and Abi go out in th and th place. They arent physical or strategic threats. I have a hard time imagine people seeing them as threats to win the game. Obviously things dont always play out as expected but I cant imagine Abi and ESPECIALLY Kimmi making it that far but not going all the way.,survivorspoilers,cvs1d20,5,t5_383r7

6675348,0,t3_46eaki,Noticed something on the screencap of Aubry!!!!! In the red circle I noticed the green design from the Chanloh buff. Also the surroundings of the beach match Lonely Beach where the Brains tribe and Ta Keo tribe lived. If she was at Brawn the surroundings would have differed.

7118951,0,t3_4d0bja,So blindside the viewer???? I happen to like Nick and am hoping he wins the game..but I dont think he is well liked enough that if he leaves it is going to piss people off. I do think that cydneys comment is a misdirect but if not it would indicate Jason leaves in episode .  But again I dont think cbs would put up a warning blindside you for jason..when julia and michelle are talking they are saying make a move at some point..to me this would indicate that tai is likely voted out next..thus him being lovable and a fan favorite would blindside you...the audience..although based on cyds comment I could see where either joe or tai gets medevaced and they do tribal anyway and joe is gonem Although Im not sure why the previous episode had about  huge indicators of nick going next.

7645682,0,t3_4k0rg2,Well wow just wow. after watching Cydneys whole ponderosa video. I guess I missed something. What happened between jason scot and Cydney to make them treat her that way at Ponderosa? Sore losers much? I thought Cydney was respectful to all throughout the game. It was one of the reasons I liked her. If any of her decisions affected their game...well it is a game after all. She had every right to make decisions that advanced her further. I dont know...I just dont understand holding a grudge about anything in a game. Also I had given them the benefit of the doubt thinking the bullying was a part of their game play. But this treatment of Cydney after the game makes it seem like thats just who they really are. Ugh.Also will we be seeing after videos from Aubry amp Tai?,survivorspoilers,d3b9txz,6,t5_383r7

9580914,0,t1_d9u0air,Because its wellknown that Jeff loves his alpha men. Pls.I think youre excluding Chris as a prime possibility. He had a rocky start but lately hes been on a good path. And when he voted off CeCe that was a very strong episode for him.Speaking as someone who considers Adam his favorite Im a bit skeptical of Adam at the moment. Hes digging himself a hole with TaylorJayWill and compromising trust with some of his allies. I still want him to go far and do as well as possible but I also am kinda sensing after tonight hes a potential shocker boot around maybe Final  give or take.,survivorspoilers,d9u1kma,5,t5_383r7
