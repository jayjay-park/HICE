917647,0,t1_ch8kn94,To add to what uRNGezus said some quests can only be completed after you read through all of Rewrite and its kind of a hassle so a guide is recommended.,vndiscuss,ch8lc4f,1,t5_2vb51

1273688,0,t3_28o98v,One of the interesting things about Rewrite is that the less Kotarou does the worse things seem to turn out. In Kotoris route Kotarou is somewhat handsoff and lets Kotori do her thing which results in the Key being destroyed but also saves the world sorta. In Chihayas route Kotarou puts in mad work and everything goes pretty well. And then Shizurus route happens where Kotarou does basically nothing and almost all of humanity is wiped out. Something to consider going into the next routes Does this pattern stay consistent or is it subverted?,vndiscuss,cicwnza,3,t5_2vb51

3131874,0,t1_comk35r,I figured it was supposed to be something like that but I couldnt get the timeline to make sense. Thinking over it again it would maybe fit if SERN achieved timetravel in a worldline X then sent a messenger back to attack the lab in  so the technology could be achieved faster we would then be at the point where the game starts after the prologue. ,vndiscuss,comm7oo,1,t5_2vb51
4597092,0,t3_3dyvhn,You have to pick Use my brain in the Refrain segment. Im gonna stick with Rins route being my least favorite. Its not that I find the writing flawed but rather that it resonates negatively with me on a fundamental level. Rins route is structure in such a way that the world seemingly turns against Riki while he has no way to defend himself. This just makes the world seem hostile and why would I want to indulge myself in such a place. To me there is nothing entertaining about a person being crushed by the stoic cruelty of the world. Called Game is one of the most awesome scenes in LB! but the rest of the route I dont want to see. ,vndiscuss,cta1yop,2,t5_2vb51
