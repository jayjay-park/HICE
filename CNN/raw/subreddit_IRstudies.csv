130733,0,t1_cet46rx,The failure to distinguish between being a hegemon something all states want to be and bidding for hegemony something that is incredibly risky is very problematic. Its difficult to reconcile Mearsheimers assumption of rational survivalminded states with states that make bids for hegemony seeing how poor the success rate is for such bids. The notion that China will imitiate Uncle Sam and learn from the US bid for regional hegemony is also peculiar considering that the US could become a hegemon because it lacked any great powers native to its region or European great powers that were willing and able to contain it see this article . If China should learn anything from the US rise to hegemony its that the US backyard was completely different to Chinas today. Chinas neighbours three great or potentially great powers two nuclear states two states that could get nukes in a second and the US a state with an ability to project power globally like no other state has had make it profoundly irrational and dangerous for China to make a bid for hegemony. Thankfully the theory has gotten most or all of its predictions wrong.,IRstudies,cetbi67,2,t5_2s8z8

859579,0,t3_23yfjz,gtMake note Im just a high schooler. I dont have any significant experience in academic IR studies and I get most of my information from books magazines and journals. To be honest Im a little fuzzy on theoryI was the same in high school trying to selfteach. If you have the opportunity to take a college introIR course it clears up sooo much. If you did it like me you are teaching yourself out of order and context and in a way that biases strongly towards some things and not others. Anyway if you cant take an organized class try to pick up a book on theory and that starts at the basics. I havent read it yet but if you like Realism then The Tragedy of Great Power Politics is supposedly excellent. Likewise The End of History is the goto Liberal book. Havent read that either yet so someone correct me if Im way offbase with these recommendations. Theres also Constructivism as the new thing but Im not really familiar with it. Anyways getting theories down more  helps a ton it definitely changed my views on whether or not certain wars were goodbad ideas. But from your post you seem to have a good grasp on things so IDK if this advice will help that much. this isnt related to your question I just thought it might be helpfulAnyways your question is basically Liberal Vs Realist it seems. A liberal of the Neoconservative Bush Rumsfeld Cheney ect. branch would say Saddam violated the liberal order first and now the newly democratic Iraq has removed the threat. Iraq will join the other democracies and only attack dictators til there are none left and we have world peace. this is really dumbed down but you get the pointOther less militaristic liberals the Clintons Woodrow Wilson especially would say that that was an expected occasional breakdown in the liberal order and that liberal institutions for the most part prevent this sort of thing from happening more often as it would if there was no UN or WTO ect. In their eyes if Bush were ever put to international court and tried then it would be proof of the liberal orders success. The liberal order includes international free trade which liberals say makes war unprofitable and so they say unlikely.Realists George HW Bush Nixon Kissinger would agree with your middle paragraph that the global order is a manifestation of American hegemony and that liberal institutions are set up to maximally benefit the USA which is why other powers become revisionists IranChinaRussia does not feel it benefits from a USled order the WTO World Bank ect and wants to set up an new order that maximizes their own power instead.So its depends on who you ask there is no real consensus here. For what its worth I think you are dead on about the liberal order really being the American order and like you said its mostly been a good thing. ,IRstudies,ch1zm84,1,t5_2s8z8

Essentially it collects all of the job postings out there including those that are not publicly posted in an easy to use manner.

5100431,0,t1_cv002a3,Ah I understand. I dont really have any tips for reading large amounts but I will tell you that I did not have the discipline to read that much when I was an undergrad. It is possible to develop that discipline you just need to experiment to find a reading strategy that works for you. For me I would primarily sit in a comfy chair with a large cup of coffee and I would read all my text in one or two sittings. But I would also do some of my readings when I was on buses or trains and in between classes. A big help was that I cut out other timeconsuming activities like watching TV or playing video games. To help I uninstalled games and cancelled my cable subscription. I also cancelled my reddit account and didnt return until my final semester a bad decision as I should have waited until I graduated. If I couldnt access it I wouldnt be distracted by it.,IRstudies,cv0sj5h,2,t5_2s8z8

6371890,0,t3_42xo1b,Does Ikenberry acknowledge difference between the embedded liberal period and neoliberalism?He seems to have very high assumptions about the rules of the system. Many are not happy about the rules. He really swallows the universal appeal of liberalism. I think he needs an injection of Carr and Marx. China will not just contend with hierarchy against America. It will content with that hierarchy over the rules. Right now were all happy but once Chinas growth isnt gt we will see a desire to reformulate. Neoliberalism allowed for transnational capital to takevoer state interests. As such more classes and states are exploited and alienated. You dont even need to dip into marxism to see those problems. Neoliberalism carried a very different structure and unilateralism transnational capital and washington concensus that embedded liberalism did not have. I cant help but see Ikenberrys view from the elite. Liberalism is universal capitalism makes everyone happy and neoliberalism isnt a new era. ,IRstudies,czdwwio,3,t5_2s8z8
