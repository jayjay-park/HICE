5159238,0,t3_3lh7yz,I ran the one for Media Insiders and I wasnt banned.  Only issue was the CheckPoints app ran really slow.  So slow that at times it wasnt worth the VPN.,CheckPts,cv7vozj,1,t5_39lis
5230663,0,t3_3mmv38,i just wish it was cleared on how many accounts you can create. the times ive asked specifically can i have more than one account im always told one account per device. ,CheckPts,cvghiav,0,t5_39lis
5365212,0,t3_3ogtaf,I run an LG Volt against the  Moto G and  Moto G and the Volt blows them both out of the water on point redemption and battery life. LG Volt is  at Best Buy and probably the best phone I have ever used for the price with any GPT app.,CheckPts,cvxgt2f,1,t5_39lis

Set up alerts with a page monitor to see if the web page changes that will likely let you know if they change the status to in stock. Store availability will depend heavily on your location.,CheckPts,cxdumfd,1,t5_39lis

6748852,0,t3_485606,You have to sign up for Checkpoints on a device thats logged into Google Play and that had Checkpoints installed from Google Play.  You can then login to the account you made on a phone that doesnt have Google play installed.Had the same problem the other day and thats how I fixed it.,CheckPts,d0hdz7o,5,t5_39lis

7136682,0,t1_d1pacd0,Yep I just noticed that static ad yesterday too and my  LG Destiny were running great before yesterday. Also saw the bitcoin static ad that rab mentioned on Perk Word Search.Edit LOL at the Checkpoint banner picture in this sub.,CheckPts,d1pd2j7,1,t5_39lis
7157957,0,t3_4dj9pz,You obviously dont understand how this works. That wouldnt cause an ad drought. I suggest doing some more research on said topic. Please think before posting.,CheckPts,d1rsgly,1,t5_39lis

7733088,0,t1_d3l2c8a,If youve just started using the app then you might end up needing a review for your first few redemptions but after that you will get your rewards more quickly.To share some stats the average wait time for redemption is . days most redemptions are instant and most accounts are reviewed within  days after a redemption is requested if a review is needed. We do sometimes have wait times as long as  days this is usually only on an individual basis if the account in question requires further review and that takes more time.,CheckPts,d3l7452,0,t5_39lis
8187165,0,t1_d50s8e7,Yep.  Something def isnt right. I hope it gets resolved soon since as a someone above said they cant make money when we cant watch videosads.,CheckPts,d50y3lp,2,t5_39lis
8666689,0,t1_d6oy7ua,I kmow theres a site cant remember the name but it has to be at least  and I know theres a subreddit but never been there and I dont know the usual wait times people go through when selling their cards. Can i sell  agc and how much of a discount would be acceptable? Or is there a way to put my balance on a card and sell it?,CheckPts,d6oyeuu,2,t5_39lis
8853478,0,t3_51d2xt,Also just realized today that they do have PayPal. If I had saw that before I cashed out I would have went with it. Is it more points to do it this way? Do you get it quicker?,CheckPts,d7c29hz,1,t5_39lis
9390675,0,t1_d95a0z1,They credit fine and work fine on S I run many many of them but the soft cap which they refuse to admit makes it pretty pointless after  or thereabout. You are right that the S are not as stable as they used to be. Thats to be expected given the age of the device. I dont have a single Android device from the S era still running and if I did it wouldnt be earning anything either. So all in all it is what it is. S on CheckPoints is hit or miss. Still get the infinite spin and the app does crash a bit too much but overall its ok.,CheckPts,d96c28j,0,t5_39lis
9447615,0,t1_d9dhqwi,weird.  i get that sometimes  but . regularly crashes to home screen.   must depend on the device. ,CheckPts,d9djv83,2,t5_39lis

9800755,0,t3_5flbw3,Every few hours or so one or two freeze on a loading screen. Even on the worst days everything is still working far far better than a certain other app has been for months.Usually I have found when the phones constantly lock up that sometimes resetting the advertising ID in your Google settings helps. This isnt always the case but its the first thing I do if clearing the data doesnt work. If that doesnt work and you use the phone often then its probably about time for a factory reset.,CheckPts,dal5k9w,1,t5_39lis
