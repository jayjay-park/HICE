445520,0,t1_cfqwbth,The street tracks are just too tight with laughable surfaces. Remember the railroad tracks in Baltimore? Not to mention they are all too short as well. IndyCar at Elkhart Lake would be amazing. ,INDYCAR,cfqxyvx,1,t5_2sdeq
486974,0,t1_cfuefgq,gt We have spec cars...and dont you dare change a thing.Arent aero kits coming soon?gt We have gimmicks...push to pass dumbed up cars for Texas and Fontana and wing restrictions so the DW is drivable at high speed tracks.How is push to pass worse than DRS? I fail to see the problem with oval and road course specific aero kits. Either the road course performance will suck or the oval performance will suck if you dont change any of the parts.gt Lets see now.....Brazil is gone isnt that where TK and Helio are from? as is Baltimore.I dont see what the appeal of Baltimore is. Theres so many other tracks that are a lot nicer. Granted Ive only started following IndyCar in the last few years so maybe I just dont appreciate the history of it.gt And if rumors are true Long Beach will soon be long gone.Thats not going to happen. F will never go to Long Beach.gt Trying to find new venues particularly ovals with the money IndyCar demands as a sanction fee is a job for Super ManTheres plenty of tracks out there. If IndyCar eventually gets to the point where they cant find enough tracks theyll either start looking at tracks in different countries or lower their fees.gt The season is from March th till late August...thats  months.  months and  races at  venues with several twin races on a weekend and two at Indy in May. Dont blink itll be over!!Yeah I agree. The season should a bit longer although usually casual viewers stop watching when football is back. I dont blame them either.gt The pay out for winning any race but Indy is ...ooppps..Texas and Fontana pay ...WOW. Go ahead try to promote that!!I dont think the casual fan cares about the prize money.gt Two drivers who left after winning the  and spent much of their time downgrading it........... now are the savoir of the  and I am sure the ticket sales for the  and TV rating will go back to  levels. Right!!What.gt Last year it took what?  worth of groceries bought at Kroger in the Indianapolis area to get two FREE tickets to the ...and the Speedway raised prices for this year!!! Yep...were on the right path???Theres an ungodly number of seats and a ton of general admission areas. Im not sure if youre upset that its too cheap or too expensive. Either way it seems like the  was absolutely packed both years I was there.gt NBC Sports seems to have done fine with the Olympics...so it isnt the TV provider..its the product put on the tube so this year with all the promised improvements IndyCar ratings should be off the charts. Wait a minute there are no improvements which pleases Helio and TK....since the status quo makes for an increasing fan base according to them if only the drivers make all or agree to all the decisions. Sure and dont forget the team owners. The fans? Screw the fans we know whats best for them.....sounds like the government doesnt it?NBCs coverage of the Olympics was terrible. I dont know what you were watching but I was extremely disappointed. NBCs coverage of IndyCar also sucks. Its frustrating to watch a race when there are commercials every few laps. Usually after the second set of commercials within a ten minute span I just stop watching.Also most of the fans who post on sites like these really dont know whats good for the sport. They only care about whats interesting to them. Take a gander at rFormula. Everyone there is convinced that Bernie is the second coming of Satan yet the sport has grown like crazy ever since he took over. Sure the hardcore fan hates the new double points thing but I guarantee it helps maintain interest right up until the final race of the season.gt All we need is promote the drivers......which is exactly what has been done since CART collapsed and joined the IRL to form IndyCar. Has it worked?Everyone here seems to agree that theres a huge promotional problem.gt Two of the teams and the Speedway as well are headed to court to clean their dirty laundry. Nothing like a good old fashioned lawyer on lawyer lap or two to bring new fans!!!I have no idea what youre talking about so I highly doubt casual fans have any idea whats going on.gt And to top it off......TK says he cant understand NASCARs new rules for the Chase. Psst tell him he doesnt have to understand it...but he might like to take a look at this  and how much each driver in the Sprint Series earned racing. Perhaps if he understood it.....hed understand why the IndyCar series is filled with older and older drivers driving for less and less and Sprint Cup has  rookies..including one to the best young drivers who spent his entire career to date in open wheel cars and now he drives stock cars. Hey even Ruben now drives stock cars....in Brazil.Rubens left because no one picked him up. Also its not that surprising that Nascar drivers make more.

Just like rookies must pass some tests to qualify for the  I think all drivers should have to pass some kind of standing start test.Sometimes problemsaccidents happen.

2093115,0,t3_2ivh9j,Seems like partial canopies are going to be a thing maybe as soon as  but definitely by . I think thats awesome and I think it would be hard to find anyone against it.  Full canopies are a little different. I guess the worry is being able to get the driver out of the cockpit if there is a fire or they need an immediate assistance from medical staff.  If the crash is bad enough it may be difficult to pry open a closed cockpit quickly.  Maybe instead of completely closed they could put some kind of mesh over the partial canopy like NASCARs mesh windows to guard against freak accidents but Im not sure that even that would really do more good then harm.

I in no way to see any driver get hurt or die and the way the title of the article is written is meant for click bait. So the answer to the question is obviously no the powers that be should not risk another humans life at the benefit to build their organization.  Now with that being said these drivers know the risk and choose to do this sport for a living. They KNOW they can die doing it theyve seen their friends and fellow racers die doing it and guess what? THEY KEEP FUCKING DOING IT!How is it any different than the guy that walks a tight rope across the grand canyon or the x games guys that do triple back flips on their motorcycles or the base jumping guys?  They do it for an audience and for the thrill. Granted it doesnt need to be more dangerous than necessary but at the same time like Carpenter said if you dont like it or dont want to do it then dont.  If my boss told me I had to do something that risked my life if I didnt want to do it then Id quit. What makes these guys any different? Because they make more money? Because theyre celebrities.

Pit pass is actually pit row where the car and crew will be during practice qualifying and the race.  Not quite the same thing.  Paddock passes are interesting.  You get to see the crew working on the cars.  Sometimes you get to see an owner or a driver but usually they zip in and out too quickly for more than a glance.  Occasionally the more social ones may sign autographs or have a few photos taken with fans.  Or one may be seen being interviewed by one of the TV crews.If you keep your eyes open or youre good at recognizing people you may see others wandering around the paddockformer drivers former or less recognizable owners etc.  Theres also the inspection area the seater and some other things to look at.Most if not all of the teams have cards you can pick up from their paddock areas that have photosnamesstats of their drivers.

The big difference between IndyCar and F is that those high G loads are sustained for a long turn at an oval rather than quickly being applied then released.

I like Pirelli world challenge Weathertec Sportscar Racing and WEC but its so hard to follow here because its broadcast infrequently and on difference channels or not at all. I watch Le Mans one year almost all  hours of it except when it isnt available. I like following Rally and have attended several Rally America events but WRC hasnt been broadcast regularly since I was a kid. I dont really watch NASCAR except a few races at the beginning of the season when theres no football but the other racing hasnt started up yet.That being said I am literally the only person I know at all who follows any form of racing besides NASCAR and those who do watch NASCAR are all double my age. I tried talking F at work and there wasnt a single person who knew any of the drivers or even vaguely what the cars looked like and obviously none of them cared.

One where there was no oh I wish they went back there and one which pretty much nailed every top circuit in America. Now with Phoenix Road America and Watkins Glen back were pretty much at the stage where potentially the only additions you could make that would improve the schedule in terms of major circuits are MichiganFontana Laguna Seca Road Atlanta Sebring and Portland  and considering RA and Sebring arent natural openwheel habitats though a lot of teams test at Sebring and Laguna Seca has reportedly fallen back on safety improvements plus wouldnt be a great fit for the current higherdownforce style of Indycar racing and Im pretty happy with what we have. Does give me a major dilemma though as Im scheduled to potentially travel to Loheac for the WorldRX round on that weekend or potentially tick off a bucket list race at Darlington for the Southern ...we now have a third choice thrown in the mix! ,INDYCAR,d34d0oj,1,t5_2sdeq

8409112,0,t3_4usjpv,This kills the racing.The one thing Indycar has going for it over its previous incarnations and Formula racing has been the aero effect of the rear bumper pods. By reducing the turbulence coming off those rear tires they not only reduce the drag but they also reduce the effects of aero push for the following car. This makes the road and street races more exciting while also allowing for competitive oval racing that doesnt involve big dangerous NASCARplatestyle packs.Also while a lot of people talk about them being too flimsy to prevent hard wheel to wheel contact when one guy goes smashing into the other they do provide a major visual deterrent from the more insidious form of light frontwing to rear wheel contact where a tire would get cut.I get it it looks cooler more old school. But the rear pods on the cars are doing a lot more than people seem to want to acknowledge given that were currently in the middle of an aero war similar to what made Formula  so boring a decade or so back.,INDYCAR,d5son1u,43,t5_2sdeq

While it is true that the design isnt very good for standing starts the cars are absolutely capable of doing it. They do it every pit stop. And we tried several standing starts in these cars and each time between  and  of drivers did it just fine. But in the transition to standing starts with a number of drivers not familiar with them and not the best mechanism a small number of drivers had difficulty and stalled out. This led to one bad accident and the series bailed on the concept. Its BS. Road racing absolutely should have standing starts. Its much fairer better for fans and a bigger challenge for drivers.

9651539,0,t3_5d7tq7,Technically the National Championship is one of the oldest trophies in motorsports predating the WDC and the Indy . Theres kind of a prestige in there taking in fact it has recognized the Indy Car champions of the AAA USAC CART IRL and Unified eras.However it has always taken a secondary role to the winner of the Indy . And its not a consequence of the decay in popularity of the series. In the USAC days the Indy  was the big moneymaker while the other races purses were pretty low. In the CART days Indy was not only in promotion but also in rule making the special one. Hell CART tried to steal the mantle of Indy with the U.S.  but the failure that was that race forced them to start to rep the championship as the big price.Meanwhile the World Drivers Championship has been the award for being the most consistent driver in the Grand Prix world trail. Which actually became a world trail when they added the Indy  to the Grand Prix season in .

Probably an unfair advantage but it may be worth giving him one because of all the light he can shine on the race.  If there are others in this years  that havent run Indy in the DW they probably at least have oval experience.,INDYCAR,dg8s4lu,1,t5_2sdeq

By  the speedway was only hosting one event a year and although it only ran  miles it was clear it was still the same race as the  in  and the  scheduled for .Donald Davidson describes how the reduced  mile distance was described as contributing to the war effort by cutting down on expenditure on tyres fuel and the like.   However Carl Fisher had got the feeling that  miles was too long for the spectators so used the war as an excuse to cut down the distance he however misjudged public opinion and announced the restoration of the full distance for  almost as soon as the  race was over.,INDYCAR,dgfeg40,19,t5_2sdeq

11800028,0,t1_dgxkcos,It was shitty that the US invaded your country.But at least in war there are international rules that countries obey when combatting each other. Not saying war doesnt suck... just saying theres a supposedly civil way of going about it. The reason Concentration Camps are so heinous is because its just about the worst possible thing a government could do to an individual or group of individuals. Theres no one to protect these people no international rules to help them. In war you risk death. In Concentration Camps you risk living through much worse than death. ,INDYCAR,dgxko6z,1,t5_2sdeq
