An amazing book that helped me in a lot of ways .If you want to learn about web connectivity or what Im assuming you mean by that youll want to learn about socket programming.I cant really suggest a good book for that unfortunately.

8943,0,t1_cef0io6,This is wrong on so many levels...gt Longer answer I would start with Cprocedurally and then learn about Object Oriented Programming in CAfter I had a solid foundation of procedural programming.gt At some point I feel the switch to C when learning things procedurally is necessary. Lower level memory management is a good topic and C snippets are likely going to be not only useful but necessary for any large project you start.It doesnt make sense to split C into a procedural and object oriented part.  If you are writing good code you will be making use of existing functions classes and templates that are written using a mix of procedural object oriented and generic styles.  Yes youll probably start without writing your own classes because it doesnt make sense to write classes until you know how to write functions but thats the case in pretty much all languages.gt Its essentially the same thing as C syntax wiseminus objects except youre using scanfprintf instead of cincout. Though personally I prefer printf to cout anyway.No it isnt.  Not even close.  Exception handling throws that right out.gt Then I would move onto learn Csince its relevant to you when I felt I had a good grasp of object oriented programming in C.So after youve wasted around a year learning a language that uses OO differently?gt The reason I feel this is important is because C is entirely object oriented and OoP was a mine field for me to wrap my head around when I first saw it. Now that Ive had some good experience with it in C? Not so much.No it isnt.  And the OO part of C is significantly simpler than the OO part of C  and thats not to mention the rest of C which is definitely more complex.gt As for where you could start ...thenewboston is explicitly discouraged by the wiki.,learnprogramming,cefgcnp,1,t5_2r7yd

33229,0,t3_1uhpgt,To be clear theres nothing that you cant accomplish with C that suddenly becomes possible if you add Lua to it  the languages are strictly speaking equally powerful especially considering that Luas only dependency is the C standard library. The main reason you might want to use a scripting language in your application is that programming in scripting languages is usually easier.  Theres a reason so many startups are working with Ruby and Python  if you want to start with zero and come up with a releasable product scripting languages let you do it much faster.  For example doing highlevel transformations on strings in C is notoriously timeconsuming and error prone but very simple in Ruby or Lua.  Scripting languages also free you of long compile times static typing and other things that are good ideas in the long run but might not matter so much in a context where having a minimal development time is key.Moreover using Lua embedded in C gives you the advantages of both languages.  You get all the advantages of dynamic scripting but its easy to drop down to C if you want to speed up certain algorithms.,learnprogramming,cei7qgd,2,t5_2r7yd

IBM is still huge innovative and making tons of money which isnt a bad thing. However Microsoft will no longer dominate enterprise just as IBM no longer dominates enterprise.While Windows has gotten better in working with the languages and tools of the open source stack most of the people writing it write it for Linux first. I remember a couple of years ago Microsoft actively courting web companies in trying to bring them to Azure this was before they publicly announced Linux support. Microsoft has been contributing a lot to open source like working with Drupalers on PDO driver for MS SQLServer and even Linux for Hypvervisor compatibility but theres still a huge impedence mismatch between Windows and its tools and the toolsets that the majority of the open source community works with.Im a huge Windows fan or was. Im on a new Windows box for my main dev machine. I have a windows tablet too. But I find the overhead of working with tools developed for Linux on Windows to be too great.

95569,0,t3_1v6pmn,First Categories and protocols are are two different patterns.Categories are extensions on classes and you do this by defining a category then importing the category in the classs that needs them.  ex I need to dynamic create lighterdarker colors. I can create a category on UIColor which defines  methods that returns a lighterdarker color of UIColor object and import the category in my VCclass.  I can then dynamically create a color and get the lighterdarker shading from calling my category methods.  You can also category class methods.  i.e. define a skyBlue color and call it like UIColor skyBlueColor.  Protocols are used as interactions points for a class most useful for UI calls.  They are basically callbacks you are expecting some other class to respond to.  Its always good to point out iOS delegates tableView appDelegate life cycle vc life cycle textfields...  That being said its hard to recognize its usefulness when you have other really powerful tools like blocks notifications segue not really same or simply making the call directly. . Delegates patterns are better than blocks because of its transparency and ease of use.  Im not saying always use delegates as there are some very good reason to use blocks for async tasks but given the choice use delegates.  In professional development readability and extendibility is by far the most important.  Yes a block inside a function might be quicker but debugging checking retain cycle possible memory issue is just not worth it.  Not to mention you can be a pro but some junior dev can always come in and mess something up.  . Notifications run into similar problems as blocks lack of transparency.  Hunting down how manywhere notifications are fired is a pain.  Unless you are doing something very specific stay away.  . Segue is the new navigation introduced in iOS.  If you are working on a team stay away from multiple VCs in one storyboard.  Merging IB is a pain.  Thus segues are pointless.  . Hooking up the class directly.  Here you are talking about design and if the  classes should be tightly coupled.  If not then delegate the calls.   does not play well together for UI calls show key board present pop over view navigation etc.  You need to sync up the interactions between those calls.  Also as noted previously iOS has its UI delegates which is why youll avoid headaches keeping your UI calls on delegates.  You still need to do some syncing but at least youll have transparency Normal pattern is define protocol on model and have its delegate point to current VC.  This is most powerful when combined with the singleton pattern where your singleton data manager i.e. core data manager delegate its update view calls to the delegate VC.  All the patterns have its strengths except segue but if someone know please post so you should try to use all of them and learn them.

147469,0,t3_1vrhyu,Im not an expert on how python works but heres a shot.  Python at least the main implementation is written in C.  Once you get to a certain point you can start writing the core API of python actually in python but you have to start somewhere and that beginning is C.So when speed is required or maybe it was just an original implementation it is written in C because C is much faster than python.  When speed isnt a huge factor then it can just be written in python which is then interpreted and run by some C runtime.Sorry if I didnt do a good job at explaining this.To answer your question more generally languages can communicate with each other in a number of ways which usually involves coming up with some way to share information.  To directly call another application this can done in much the same way you would call another application e.g. a system call.,learnprogramming,cev87fk,3,t5_2r7yd

Networking layer? Im looking at this page but Im not sure if I really get it. I thought I just need to establish some kind of server on either phone or PC and client on the other one. I guess it wasnt just that simple?gtBroadly speaking a database is any structured set of data held by your computer. Generally it should be persistent  even if you turn your computers off.gtFor the most part this will be some sort of separate service that youll need to install and connect with with via some sort of bridge youll probably will have seen something like ODBC Open Database Connectivity which will allow your code to talk to the database.gtDatabases themselves are pretty much a fundamental aspect of most nontrivial programming. So would image assets in a project counted towards database then? Also unfortunately I have not seen ODBC gt There are a few ways. It would be dependent on what your goals are.My main goal is to send the picture data via wifi so I thought making some sort of server on local network is necessary.

223040,0,t1_cf3s0bb,gtThe benefit is you can create a list that grows however big you want without ever having to resize it i.e. array backed lists need to be resized.That is a benefit of a linked list but not the important benefit. A dynamic array is much quicker for element access if you simply want a variable size container. The benefit of a linked list is that unlike a dynamic array you can insert data anywhere in the structure without having to move all the data that come after by one position. If you have  elements in your dynamic array and you want to insert a new element at position  you have to do  operations to move  elements over one spot each. With a linked list you can simply change the pointer in element  to point to the new entry and have the new entry point to old element  and youre good in  operations. If you simply want a variable size data structure and you know that you dont need to insert in the middle a dynamic array would perform better than a linked list. This is because in an array you can instantly access any element. Instead of following the links from node to node like in a linked list you can take the memory address of the first element  size of the data type  index of the the element you want to access and youre at the element.,learnprogramming,cf3ulb8,4,t5_2r7yd

Assembly is crazy simple but also crazy hard  What I mean by that is you will only really use about  instructions but you will use them a hell of a lot and really need to understand what the hell they are actually doing with your computer. This isnt simple stuff like you have in high level languages such as Python or even C. Getting a line of text printed to the screen takes a lot of work whereas in Python you would just write    printHelloAnyway the best place to get started is probably The Art of Assembly Language As for operating system programming. Well doing that in Assembly is going to be hell. There is a reason C became the number  language for operating system development! Aint nobody well except this guy wants to make an OS in Assembly on x!.Edit If I were you I would learn C first and then see if you want to go onto assembly. C is portable to different architectures much easier than assembly is and it will be much more useful to you. Not strictly true. They kind of do similar things but they are actually very different.

This allows to recompile the editor engine basically all their tools.   However a lot of the work that gets done is adding content.   Think textures materials these are created in the editor character models etc.   However because Unreal using its own scripting language much of the game specific source code is written in Unreal Script.   This counts as content and can be changed.   Basically if a game exposes its level editor its giving you all the tools that were required to build that game.   So you can take whats already there and modify things without really having to change the underlying logic too much.

Some function must actually manipulate pointers to create the loop.Your use of method let me think you put this in a OOP context where data can be protected from misuse. Ive taken this exercise as in a C context where youre more likely to encounter bare linked list. In this context you cant guarantee nobody in the code isnt messing with the list. Ensuring integrity makes sense. Also incrementing and decrementing a counter is simpler than dealing with pointers it may also reveal bugs in your own functions to deal with the list.ampgt then why dont you just add a flag to the implementation in order to keep track of whether a loop has been created or not?I never assumed the loop was voluntarily introduced but the result of some bug so obviously you cant just add a flag if a loop occurs.

What youre trying to do Check if two objects are logically equalWhat makes them equal? All their properties are equalNow the code.Theres an equals method there for you to override inherited from the Object type which everything else extends. The default implementation checks if the two objects are the same. You call it like this    obj.equalsobjSo you got that far in your method call. Except the method you wrote said    equalsint x int yWhat? What are you expecting to happen here? What values do you expect these to have? Code isnt magic. Youre trying to pass an object of type IntegerPair in here so why arent you?    equalsIntegerPair otherThe name other is arbitrary here. Unlike the this keyword well be using in a minute which gives you a reference to the object youre calling methods inside.    this.x  other. xRight? Now you can do that. Now you can check. Presto comparo.Some notes on thisgtI didnt know you could pass an object of type IntegerPair in there! Why not? Whats stopping you? If you were doing some other method like Add that looked like pairOne.addpairTwo youd probably immediately have written the method    addIntegerPair randomNameThatDoesntMatterRight?gt Why does it work like that? Thats weird.Objects have an equals method. Youre overriding that. Could you have written a method in a completely different place which did the checking? Yes. So why do we write the equals method on the class were dealing with? Actually there are a load of reasons this is a good design practice to summarise imagine if you could never compare if two numbers were equal without running some other utility method. We like to keep things together.gt Override?If you extend a class and write a method in your subclass with a name you used in the base class calls to subclass.thatMethod will use the subclasss version.

I think itd probably be best to run this on a timer every . seconds or something whatever you want but if youd rather have it run some other way lemme know or Google it. The Timer info page the top section is kinda confusing just look at the examples.So to set up a timer basically what you do is turn it on and then tell it what section of the code you want to run a timer. First you need to make your random number code an actual section    RandomNumberGen    Local myVariable  Random      If myVariable   Then        SendA    ElseIf myVariable   Then        SendB    ElseIf myVariable   Then        SendUp    .....    EndIf    returnNote the top line the name of your section and the bottom line return  just signifies the end of your section. Now the timer! Following the examples the Timer set up would go at the top of your code. It looks something like this    SetTimer ltthe section namegt lthow long to wait in millisecondsgtThe section name in the example is RandomNumberGen but you could make it whatever you want. If you wanted to wait  seconds before running your section of code again youd put  as the last part.Last but not least AutoItAutoHotKey scripts I might be wrong here need Persistent at the top so that it knows you want it to stay open and run multiple times or in other words be persistent. So above your SetTimer thing you need to add Persistent.

Dont worry about whether a school is topnotch or not your portfolio of personal projects will speak for itself. Remember that youre only doing this to gain the useful skills you didnt think you gained doing poli sci.If you want to dive fully into the industry programming side of things Id recommend you either get a Software Engineering degree or do a Computer Science degree with a specialization in Software Engineering. Your poli sci skills might come in handy when dealing with the politics of large organizations such as opensource projects. Software Engineering is half programming half dealing with your development team effectively. You may have a unique edge in your team projects because you can probably communicate in more effective ways through writing than your colleagues can. Try to juice that as much as possible.That being said youre probably going to want to refresh your algebra and calculus skills as well as prime yourself in vector mathematics. Those all feature quite heavily in most computeroriented disciplines. Calculus set theory and discrete math feature in algorithm construction and analysis and vector algebra is essentially what every GPU does when it runs a game.However if you dont want to retool your brain too completely there are probably options for you in health information systems or geoinformatics that might land you a good job in government or with contractors to government.

403495,0,t1_cfmbqjw,I would claim that if factorial ever gets called with n lt  then a programmer made a mistake and you need to trap that error as close to the site of the mistake as possible.  Exceptions can get caught at any point in the callstack and you might have lost information about the state of the program when it crashed.Further exceptions arent available in C.  I write C on game consoles and they dont really support exceptions either.  In many languages e.g. Java a failed assertion will actually throw an exception.What actually goes on under the hood varies from language to language but when your intent is to catch a programmers mistake assertions are usually the best approach.  Most languages have a way to turn them off for release builds so that they dont impact performance.  For example More readingHowever  if youre working on an application that must absolutely positively never ever crash in the real world flight control health stuff power plants etc then exceptions are a great way to robustly recover from failures.Also some languages have more idiomatic ways to catch programmer errors like Cs ArgumentException.

I assume you are going for    if agegtoldestAgeFor the st problem you are asking for the name as the first statement of the while loop. So it doesnt matter if you entered quit as the new name because the while loop condition will not be evaluated until you have also entered that persons age. Usually when you are doing a while loop with this kind of structure you will want to update the name variable before the while loop starts and then again at the end. Maybe something like    name  get the name    while!name.equalsquit         age  get the age        evaluate oldest age        name  get the name    You could also hack something in like    whiletrue        name  get the name       if name.equalsquit             break       ...

545665,0,t1_cg2aeyo,gt Im thinking the fault has to do with reallocing using wallLists pointed data if thats a thing and then suddenly switching over to mallocrealloc calloc and malloc can be used interchangably. There is no problem reallocing memory that has been malloced or mallocing an element inside of a realloced array.That said you may or may not find it easier to reason about with just malloc.As I said I suspect the issue is using a pointer after its been potentially freed by passing it to realloc. You should not use a pointer after you pass it to realloc you have to use the result of realloc in its place.aaaand Id help more but its my bedtime. ,learnprogramming,cg2arkr,1,t5_2r7yd

If you took time off to travel  study  do your own programming projects etc its probably ok whereas if you sat around watching TV for  months your skills get rusty and its not going to look great.Now about the types of job you could get as someone with  years experience and a good amount of knowledge in various areas I make a good wage I could make that taking on one  month consulting project if it matched my skills I doubt this is suitable for someone just graduated.You could take on shorter projects but its harder to find  x  month projects that follow on from each other than it is to find  x  month well paying project.

552982,0,t3_20gyaa,There are a number of things you can do to help First dont start coding without a design document detailing how the software will work. You need designs of your classes etc so you have a guide when building everything. Next use some source control  work item tracking software like TFS. Use your design document to generate tasks in TFS then every time you complete one check in that change. Next you probably need to look at your coding style. You say you comment everything but why do you need so many comments?If you need a comment to tell you what a variable is its named wrong if you need a comment to tell you what a method does again its named wrong. Like me you might be making your methods too complex look up the single responsibility principle. It states that a method should do one thing. I find it makes code a lot simpler to understand. Next look at breaking your code up into better classes smaller classes doing specific things is preferable larger classes trying to do everything. Remember once you build a class you dont need to remember how each method works just remember what it does and that should be described in the documentation and be understandable from the method name. Its easy to get lost while youre starting out. Keep at it and youll find it gets easier.

A naive approach would be to divide N by every number from  to N and if none of those numbers divide evenly into N then N is prime.This is a crude form of trial division.

Why do you want to do this as a career? It sounds to me like maybe you have an idea of what programming should be like in your head but then when youre actually coding the reality is different and you lose interest and have no desire to learn as you say yourself. Maybe programming just isnt your thing and thats fine.Im not saying that it isnt by the way but you have to answer those questions. If you conclude that you really want to be a programmer I suggest working on something that is fun to you. Maybe a game or a virtual robot or a website with a topic that you care about. Anything! The most important thing is that you like the thing that youre building because then if the programming cant keep you motivated maybe the prospect of the final product can. Ideally you should make it so that you can compile and interact with even a small version of the final product that you start with. That way you can really watch it grow rather than only see it at the end.The language shouldnt really matter all that much for learning the basics.

This includes but is not limited to unit testing integration testing component testing systems testing and acceptance testing. Documentation  software developers understand that source code is dynamic not static. This means that proper documentation is required to ensure continued understanding of the system by all involved both clients and internal developers. Release  software developers may also be involved in deploying the software to its final release including building configuring and integrating. Maintenance  like a car code needs regular upkeep to continue runningwhether it be refactoring bug fixes or something else. Development Process  developers need to follow software development processes to ensure productivity quality and schedulingOf course this isnt a final definition of what a developer is just some qualities that are typical.

674086,0,t1_cggre1r,Ok on Inheritance The base concept is that every Object of Type B that inherits from an Object of Type A can duplicate As behavior. In your case that means that every Manager Object lets say mang can be used like an Employee Object. Example     Manager mang  new Managername    double wage  mang.Wage    Right now this would do the same thing as    Employee emp  new Employeename    double wage  emp.WageSince Manager does inherit from Employee we can also do this    Employee emp  new Managername    double wage  emp.WageThis means in a List with the Generic Type Employee every Instance of a Class inheriting from Employee can be stored    ListltEmployeegt list  new ListltEmployeegt    list.Addnew ManagernameThe last thing you should need is the concept of overriding Methods. A Class B that inherits from Class A can override methods there are restrictions to this but it shouldnt matter right now from A. Overriding a method does the following In class B you create a new Method with the same method siganture like the base method in class A except that you add the override keyword. Example    Employe has public double Wage ...    Manager will have public override double Wage ...Like said above the overriding method has to have the same return type and has to take the same parameters but the method body can differ     Employee     public double Wage            return hoursWorked  hourlyWage         Manager CAN have    public override double Wage             return hoursWorked  hourlyWage       Since you dont actually use methods for wage I modified them into methods because Im to lazy to see how get  set behaves with inheritance. In this case Manager overrides the Wage method of Employee but Wage can still be called the same way for Employee and Manager only the values will differ according to the calculation done in Wage. The last thing you need to look at is the scope. Not all variables can and should be seen from everywhere because of that private public etc exist. private means Only THIS class can use the given variable public means everybody can use it. Since there are cases in which inheriting classes should be able to have access to variables theres another keyword protected which means its private for THIS class and every class that does inherit from it. I hope this will help you solving the problems you had.,learnprogramming,cggw6kq,1,t5_2r7yd

So you can generate a bigger Fibonacci number but as the number gets bigger digits will get rounded off the end that you wouldnt lose if you were using a large enough integer.You can of course implement a perfect Fibonacci number generator by daisychaining carries between adds and making your own arbitrarily large integers.

Thats automatic and implicit when you use a string literal as an initializer to a char array.  There is nothing else you need to do.  Secondly this    crap  ...is writing past the end of the array which is undefined behavior and very bad.   is the size of the array the legal indices are  through .Third if you wanted to manually terminate the string you would need to assign crap   not crap.  Remember crap is the first slot so crap is the seventh.If your string is six characters and the seventh is the null character then whatever comes after that in the array is irrelevant.  The string ends at the terminator.  You can do whatever you want with the slots after that but there is no reason to do anything at all because nothing that works with a string is going to read anything past the null character in the seventh slot.,learnprogramming,cgjrat5,5,t5_2r7yd

If you want a better parallel look at Computer Science topics not programming ones.  The main difference IMHO is that Math focuses on noniterative approaches to solving problems.  With computers you have the option of simply saying run this  times and see what the result is.  The other difference I see is that in CS there is a physical representation of the abstract see Turing Machines and that adds another dimension or limitation to thinking about problems.

I typed it all in there and it runs perfectly fine with no syntax errors.Its probably just pointing out that you have two of the same variable names storing different information.Try changing the second a variable to something else and then calling square with the new variable name to see if that fixes it.,learnprogramming,cgv5vi0,1,t5_2r7yd

Assignments inside while conditions and ifs? Why not! Braces around if statements? Nah what could go wrong? Use the same style of brace placement whenever we need them?

808999,0,t1_cgw8hhq,Yes both styles are readable but if the codebase is shared between team members or different teams you dont want different styles because its a distraction when trying to comprehend a section of code.

822342,0,t1_cgxr0jx,Well the method cannot possibly be correct if it returns the wrong answer for the numberampnbsp. So you need the method to returnampnbsp if the input isampnbsp. You dont have a choice here.After youve fixed that think about whether the method is doing the correct thing for an input ofampnbsp. If the input isampnbsp what should the method return? Is returning digitCountvalue the correct thing for the method to do in this case? Or what should it do instead?,learnprogramming,cgxr35l,1,t5_2r7yd

822854,0,t3_23k2py,One thing that I experienced when I was using video tutorials is that most of the ones i encountered taught you how to do something but thats about it. Just the tip. Doesnt go in depth of anything at all like i said at least in my experience so you end up learning just syntax as opposed to concepts. I really felt this when I tried to learn objects and classes on my own. So the biggest suggestion I can offer is to learn things slowlyprogressively and correctly learn every single thing about the things you learn. Such as with a string its an array of characters as well as an object and objects do have methods. With that knowledge you may make a program that is generic and takes in any string and lets you accomplish whatever you want.Im not really used to writing comments so this might just be a long stringteehee of nonsense. If thats the case I am sorry. Good luck. ,learnprogramming,cgxt6nm,5,t5_2r7yd

842499,0,t1_cgztx7y,Well the problem with takehome assignments is that you can just post them on Stack Overflow and the right answer along with a dozen wrong ones and thorough explanations of why they are wrong will be posted in a fairly short time.That said I suspect the main issue with getting people to demonstrate their coding ability in the interview room isnt the pressure its that a minute technically correct solution to a minute problem is quite different from contributing versatile documented maintainable code to a gigantic software project over the course of months or years.

You say you want to randomly connect them but the picture you show seems to have simply connected all nodes to neighbors within a certain distance. In that case youre deterministically connecting nodes that are possibly randomly placed.If you do want to connect them randomly just go over each pair and sample from some probability distribution to see if they should be connected. For instance you could connect them with a  chance for a very sparse graph and  for a very dense one. The probability can also be related to other features such as the distance between the nodes in a pair. There are also ways to constrain the degree of the nodes number of edges connected to each but this is a bit harder.It depends on what you want to accomplish.,learnprogramming,ch300ur,3,t5_2r7yd

Currently you are checking if the center of the circle is close to the center of the square but if the square is large and the circle small the circle could easily go inside the square before confirming a collision.The simplest solution is to have the user play as a circle also that way you can simply check the two middle points and see if the distance is smaller than the sum of both radii.Otherwise here is a good psuedocode example I found for circle vs square collisions Re Circle vs RectangleCircle collision and resolution,learnprogramming,ch3arx7,2,t5_2r7yd

922146,0,t3_24oasq,If you want some tips. Youre repeating yourself in your MainApp.java switch case. Figure out a way to have the code once. You could have an array of all the weightclasses and map it to a filename ie.            String weightClasses  new Stringfeatherweight.txt....              print all the weightclasses             Tournament tourney  new Tournament         Integer weight  Integer.parseIntinput.nextInt         Integer size  Integer.parseIntinput.nextInt         tourney.startweightClassesweightsize    Obviously you need more error checking and input prompts but your code should be more generalised. Or write a function that returns an int from user input that must be within a certain range.. Why do you have the user inputting the whole string? Why not just implement ... options.. Additionally Integer.parseInt can throw an exception but you dont catch it.. Youre outputting exception errors to the stdout why not stderr?. There is zero documentation.. Use spaces instead of tabs. This is a personal thing but you can have you editor automatically convert tabs to spaces. Doing this makes anyone viewing your code see it the same as some editors like to make tabs the same width as  or  spaces.. In Round.java you have while validinput  false why not while!validInput?.

947264,0,t1_chbwf7h,Im no BPM expert but I worked in it for a short stint so Ill talk about my experience. The key to BPM is understanding a process that any business takes. It isnt limited to the software industry. For example in insurance a patient submits a claim asking for reimbursement which goes to a group or department. Lets call them the intake group dont remember what theyre actually called. The intake group either has the information to reimburse that medical service or they will pass it onto a different department like a clinician department. If they have the information needed to approve or deny the claim it will go back to the intake group. Otherwise it can go on to a specialist like a doctor or surgeon on the insurance companys staff who makes the decision. Once the specialist makes the decision it may go back to the clinician or straight to the intake department depending on the specified conditions. So the basics of BPM are that there is a starting point and then there are conditions that lead to the next phase. Its a lot like a finite state machine diagrams if youve worked with those.Im not aware of a software thats called BPM but I am aware of Commercial offthe shelf COTS products that implement BPM like Pega. There are opensource enginesAPIs that you could also use to create BPM software like Activiti.I hope this helps.

When an lvalue whose type is a structure with a flexible array member is used to access an object it behaves as if that member were replaced with the longest array with the same element type that would not make the structure larger than the object being accessed the offset of the array shall remain that of the flexible array member even if this would differ from that of the replacement array. If this array would have no elements then it behaves as if it had one element but the behavior is undefined if any attempt is made to access that element or to generate a pointer one past it.gtgt gtgt ampnbspThe length is unspecified to allow for the fact that implementations may give array members different alignments according to their lengths.I interpret this to mean that the length of the flexible array member of a statically or automatically allocated object of such a structure type is unspecified by the Campnbspstandard and an attempt to access an element of the flexible array member will result in undefined behavior if it is past this unspecified length.,learnprogramming,chg9ukp,2,t5_2r7yd

1097410,0,t3_26ors9,Insertion in a BST is at worst a ON operation since that would simply be a linked list. The average case is OlogN for a completely balanced tree.The cost essentially is how many nodes you have to visit before you find the one you have to append the new item to as a child. For an unbalanced tree resembling a linked list you have to visit N nodes. For the average case with a balanced tree you have to visit as many nodes as there are levels in the tree giving OlogN. Ill leave it up to you to derive the answers.Edit just noticed you were talking about constructing the tree. That is indeed ON  and ON log N. The calculation is done based on inserting N items and the last item would then have to go through N nodes in the worst case unbalanced tree giving ON  since we discard constants in asymptotic notation it doesnt matter that the first item inserted only takes one iteration. If you can manage to balance the tree the construction goes down to ON logN because you still run the best case scenario N times. Do remember though two BSTs arent necessarily the same even if they contain the same elements  it depends on the order of insertion.,learnprogramming,cht135s,8,t5_2r7yd

1151276,0,t3_27a6p1,I think we all need to remember that programming is a subset of Computer Science. Computer Science is more broadly the study of computers so it encompasses everything from programming to computational complexity to number theory.More specifically to your question most programming does not require much in the way of math. You can definitely become a solid programmer without being strong in math. Some may say its unlikely since the skills required to do both are similar but thats a separate argument. There are definitely some areas of programming that require math like D graphics programming or calculating algorithm efficiency runtime and complexity. But again the majority of actual programming doesnt need much math.If we recall that programming is just a subset of computer science well arrive that it is important. Calculating runtime and complexity are two areas of computer science that are very math intensive.

1152620,0,t3_27bqyk,Well you know what variables are like ints and doubles and chars. Each one has a name and a type and can hold a value of that type.But you often need to create groups of variables to hold multiple pieces of data related to one thing. Example You are writing a game with a player and various monsters. Each monster has X and Y coordinates a sprite picture some data identifying the type of monster what direction the monster is moving right now and so on. So the game needs to create a lot of groups of variables to represent these monsters. Another example You are writing a phone book program which stores a list of people. Each person has a first name a last name a phone number a home address an email address and some other information. The program needs to create lots of groups of variables to represent these persons.In Java you can create classes to describe such groups of variables and then use these classes as templates for creating objects that contain all the variables. So for the game you define a class Monster and inside it you declare a variable for the X coordinate one for the Y coordinate one for the picture of the monster and so on. Then the game can create objects of this class and each such object will contain all the variables specified by the class definition. Theyre accessible as nameofobject.nameofmembervariable.You can also have callable code bits in your classes and theyre called methods. They are also accessed like the member variables but by calling. When they run the are run on an object since you call them by doing nameofobject.nameofmethodparameters and so they have access to the contents of that object. The idea is that the methods are operators that operate on the objects they belong to.Example    class Tweep      int brew     These are member variables      int snag          public Tweepint b int s     This is a constructor used to create objects        brewb        snags                public int fritzthesnagint amount     This is a method        snagamountbrew        return snag                  ...        tweepTweep     tweep.fritzthesnag    tworpTweep     tworp.fritzthesnagA class Tweep is defined and later in the program two objects of type Tweep are created by calling the constructor thus instantiating class Tweep. These are assigned to variables tweep and tworp and a method call is made on each object. Each call will update the contents of the object on which it was called.EDIT Oh and public means that a member is visible otside of the class. Everything that is not public is only accessible to the methods that are part of the class itself. This is so that you can define an interface to the class by declaring certain things as public and putting them in the documentation and then not have users of the class fiddle around with the other internal implementation details that you might want to change from time to time and which your code might depend on not being fiddled with by anything else.,learnprogramming,chza95o,2,t5_2r7yd

Sometimes hosting providers also offer free SSL proxies but I wouldnt recommend using them for anything else than the development phase.

Thinking about every possible exploit is hard. Dont reimplement what is already solved  there are so many open source libraries and frameworks already that would ease your job... This doesnt apply to security alone. You would spare yourself the work of reimplementing a user system templating database access etc. if you would use a framework.

1210140,0,t1_ci5qfyd,Thanks for this advice.  All very useful and I will consider it all when we go to make any changes.  We are not looking to make any big moves on changes for at least a couple of years for a number of reasons.  We first need to do our due diligence and have a solid plan from the beginning.  Second and this may be viewed as morbid or cruel but we know that no one lives forever and were trying not to upset the apple cart by proposing major changes while the founder is still in the picture.  He has handed over daytoday duties but still is a prominent figure in the business and there is no sense in creating problems for him in his last few years with us.  If he could leave us with the knowledge that everything he created is still running smoothly when he hands it over that would be excellent.  Besides a major undertaking like this couldnt be wrapped up and troubleshooted in a timely fashion anyway so theres no hurry.Again thanks for the advice.

1352213,0,t3_29khyb,First...Share!!! lolSecond  As always it depends. Refactoring is good practice so without seeing it i would say pick pieces you can break out easy and refactor those.  Rinse and repeat till your code is nice.For instance If the code to load a level was embedded inside your game engine break it out into a separate class that loads the level and returns the object that represents it.  Or if the level isnt represented by a contained object do that first.  Etc.  Without seeing the code hard to give much guidance.Most the life of a programmer is taking old code theirs or someone elses and fixing it while adding new features.

Again for learning purposes start with client side  the authentication is pretty easy to get set up.  For Facebook its as easy as setting up an app configuring the site to use the apps appId and then calling FB.init to get up and running.Step Three  once authenticated just start playing with the APIs endpoints  regardless of the site they likely return a JSON response which is easy to read and deal with.I know a lot of social network sites developer docs leave a bit to be desired.  Maybe start with Facebook?  They have the best documentation that Ive seen and its easy to get client side authentication set up.,learnprogramming,cirwez7,3,t5_2r7yd

1413131,0,t3_2abovl,Honest question how far did you get in your studies?I tried out programming back in high school about six or seven years ago. I absolutely hated it and dropped the class after Week  or so. My biggest issue was that the assignments were so damn boring so I thought programming as a whole was boring. I basically did assignments like Create and output these variables or Take this user input of integers do math and output result.It was only years later did I pick up programming again and really paid attention to the types of programs people wrote. The intermediate ones felt fun to me and wanting to solve those complex problems was what motivated me into programming. Still does actually  when I see a program I cant help but wonder how it was written and then want to write it myself.So I wonder if youre dropping programming because youre still stuck on the beginner topics and are dropping because there is a lack of engaging work for you.,learnprogramming,citey8h,1,t5_2r7yd

You can either use task scheduler to directly call the Python file or you can use a .bat file to call the Python executable to run your Python script.

1528128,0,t1_cj7pi2g,I still wouldnt even bother with it it makes your code harder to read and there should never ever be a question of what will actually happen. What is the point of it? As is your connection is in the using block so when an exception is thrown your connection is disposed anyways. I think I forgot to address the open connection in the other one so Ill do it here I dont think anyone else is following our conversation.It really comes down to the long session vs short session debate youll find people on both sides of the debate. In a short session if connection pooling is turned off or you dont have enough in the pool youve got a huge slow down. Under a really heavy load the long session can be slower because the connections are being held longer meaning theres less available already open connections in the pool.My experience is that the optimal conditions for the short session never happen. You never end up with connections being freed just in time for one that needs it to use it. Under heavy load typically you end up with an uneven execution you get one connection give it up then want another right after and the pool is full and so in the middle of your code it opens a new connection theres even the possibility of having to open multiple connections because they keep getting snapped up. My experience is that is not a fringe case but the norm. So I prefer to claim that connection and dont let anyone else use it until I know Im done with it. The wait for a new connection is at the beginning if the pool is full and thats the only possibility. A lot of people would reply that means you need to configure your connection pool to have more slots and I respond Im a developer Im not going to performance tune the customers servers. Most of them will just assume your app is slow and look for a replacement if its too bad.Also the pooling only works that way for Ms connecting to Ms you switch languages switch data providers your design just fell on its face. You also throw out the use of transactions when you do the short session.,learnprogramming,cj7ttdg,1,t5_2r7yd

It had MB ram .Ghz CPU... and I was a java GUI developer they told me to work with mvn in NB... right. I had to buy own MB ram because company is short on money. Late pay checks  days. We also had to write those emails with times but no one ever read it I sent empty emails a few times.The company also didnt pay for launch breaks whats more  minutes launch breaks didnt count as working hours so by working h they meant from AM to PM whats actually illegal in the UK.Once my friend and I received emails to our private addresses full of words like shit fuck fired idiot... generally saying we have a meeting the next day about our working hours I was coming late  minutes because I had no bus connection but I always stayed longer you know buses usually minutes. Our boss was workaholic he yelled as us that we work for the company only  hours a week and he has to work hours. Job offer was for a part time hours post.I took unpaid holidays in my last  weeks of work and left the company not saying it was my last day I wanted to say them fuck you. I left that day earlier just to piss them off Im happy I did it. All interns found the job from job centre at a university  of us made complaints university told you they will refuse future job offers from them.

1620669,0,t3_2curdx,Its a very interesting question you raise. I suggest that a good analogy is to becoming an apprentice carpenter.You will be given a bunch of unfamiliar tools and materials and told make a chair start with a simple one like this.Over time you learn to master the tools so that you can handle them well you learn the tricks of the trade how to make hinges and seamless joints things not to do or how to recover when youve chiselled the wrong bit sorry my lack of carpentry knowledge is now failing me. Eventually with enough time and having turned out enough chairs tables cupboards stairs of increasing quality you are an artisanal carpenter and can make wood do anything you like.That takes a lot of practice and dedication.In the context of programming the tools are languages learning their syntax and more important their semantics learning the toolset compilers build tools and so on learning the frameworks and libraries from which you assemble software learning good idioms and learning how to problem solve. Eventually after turning out a lot of software of increasing complexity you can make it do anything you like.This takes a lot of practice and dedication.At this point you probably end up running a shop full of carpenters and get an ulcer dealing with recalcitrant wood suppliers and clients who dont know which floor their stairs should go to but thats a story for another question. The main thing to focus on is enjoying the problem solving aspect thinking your way through problems is the piece least taught and most important to programming successfully. If you enjoy this and are willing to put in the time you will go far and enjoy making many things.Good luck.,learnprogramming,cjjg8re,4,t5_2r7yd

1643691,0,t3_2d57w5,Im a developer who works on smallerscale projects where we are in constant communication with the client.  A good project manager is a godsend because they can manage the client relationship and schedule priorities effectively.  Theyre always always on top of things  They know why each task is in the project how long it should take whether its critical to another task and what the client expects the outcome to be.  They take my feedback seriously reprioritize and reschedule tasks when necessary and make sure each part of the project is handled by the right people.Being technical helps if only to know what we the developers are talking about and to understand level of effort for different tasks.  Display an image on this page of the website is not the same thing as Display any image on this page of the website.A bad project manager on the other hand focuses instead on the literal description of tasks doesnt understand how tasks relate to each other and focuses on whether tasks are on schedule as their top priority.  They also bring up unrelated technical questions when discussing a particular task  which they usually think are relevant but instead distract from the primary considerations of that task.    The worst project managers Ive worked with are usually the ones hired by the client because theyre more accountants than anything else.  They dont really know whats going on but they become anal about making checkmarks to signal completion of specific line items of the contract.  Well have a twohour discussion with the clients end users why a certain task is no longer needed because an earlier task took care of that function and then the next day the project manager will argue with us for an hour about why we are not on schedule for that same task.  Frustrating.Fortunately my company has good project managers who can take care of all that.  As I said godsend.,learnprogramming,cjmcnrh,8,t5_2r7yd

Instancing is an important concept to wrap your brain around if you are unfamiliar with it.A cursory search on Google for access instance form will provide some useful links like   A huge reference written for Excel VBA but largely transferable to Access for managing classes is this link I used some of these references to generate an example database for you. The amount of code needed to create it is not very long but it is diverse and spread across several formsmodules. The example contains comments. If you would like PM me your email address and I will send it to you. I will also include a conceptual flow that may help.At home I use Access .

In real CSV you cant just split on commas since text fields can easily contain those and more so you will have to keep track if youre inside a text field or not and act accordingly. Also in assembleTokens you should really use a StringBuilder. You also always add a delimiter before a column so you will always get an empty column at the start of the row.In the assembleTokens that handles a list you suddenly use a while loop over an iterator you really should use the same foreach loop you use in the first version with the array.Last but not least your FileInput class is...strange. You really should never be reading a file into a list like that in the first place just go through the files and handle line by line and your switch to use a buffered reader for everything thats over  MB is also very odd.

1843754,0,t3_2fomxl,I hadnt been programming very long and wanted to try to efficiently store information that differed by row in Sybase. They were mostly YN things and separate columns seemed silly to me did I mention I was a novice? so I had the bright idea to steal an idea from C and store all of these as a packed byte in the database.Since this might not be reliable if we changed between big and littleendian systems I used the HEXTOINTINTTOHEX functions to make an integer field database independent.Fortunately this was not in a critical code path or anything so indexing wasnt really an issue. But I always regretted not abandoning the idea before putting it into production.The other youngin mistake I made was using SQL logic to purge duplicated rows in a table and strap a unique index on it. It ran for like  hours on several million rows of data. I felt kinda dumb because my test instance didnt have near that many rows and I had no idea it would be that bad. In retrospect the easiest and quickest thing would have been to stop the process that inserted into the table write it to disk drop the table readd the table with the unique index and load the data from disk while ignoring any duplication errors.Alternatively I could have iteratively read rows from the database into another table with the uniqueness condition and renamed it. However loadingunloading would have been faster on the aforementioned kit. Same answer for using Unix shell tools to sortuniq the data file.Happy coding!,learnprogramming,ckbda1h,3,t5_2r7yd

1899659,0,t3_2gdnfx,gt but it seems that in C it just uses some predetermined value which is different for every computer I think. No thats completely the wrong way to look at it.  Its much more dire than that.  Using an uninitialized value in any way in C is undefined behavior which means that you have no guarantees about your program and the compiler is able to do anything it wants and it often will do very strange things.  This is a very serious condition.  Consider the following testcase    include ltstdbool.hgt    include ltstdio.hgt    include ltstring.hgt    void dummyvoid            double x  . y  .        void testvoid            bool x          ifx             putsx is true                        if!x             putsx is false                int mainvoid            dummy        test        return     Bear with me.  Its written with that seemingly useless function on purpose.If I compile and run that under gcc without optimization I get     gcc foo.c         .a.out    x is true    x is falseThat is truly bizarre  x is both true and false at the same time?  Surely one branch or the other should have been taken.  But no.  This is the kind of thing that can happen when you invoke undefined behavior.  All bets are off about your program.  Undefined behavior does NOT mean that x merely takes on some unknown and unpredictable value.  Its much more subtle and pernicious than that.BTW if you compile it with O or with a different compiler youll get a different result.  Thats also the hallmark of undefined behavior.The reason for this is that at a machine level there is no such thing as empty memory.  Every valid memory address has some value.  If the address has been used before it might be the result of some past calculation.  Or if its memory thats been freshly acquired from the operating system it will contain zeros.  But the point is that in order to guarantee that a new variable is initialized to some value requires extra work to set it to that value.  Python being a high level language has no problem with taking that performance hit of initializing a variable to a known state.  C and C have a very different philosophy which is that you should be able to finely control what happens at a low level and taking some action to initialize a variable requires explicit action on the users part.  Thats why the language forbids using uninitialized variables and why you get random values if you try to do that anyway.,learnprogramming,cki3jqp,9,t5_2r7yd

1916398,0,t3_2gl035,TLDR Its not as long as were talking about imperative programming yet is fundamental for very nice techniques of functional programming.Loops are fundamental technique that is MUCH better in imperative programming. Why? Recursion needs memory. Every function call must be put on the stack whatever if system stack internal stack of VM gt these are limited so very deep recursion wouldnt work. It is why naive recursive algorithms are Onspace. When we build algorithms better we can achieve better solution by using tailrecursion. However it is still usually Olognspace requirement. Also overhaul of the recursion changes time complexity. It is why we use technique called dynamic programming. It aims into saving previous subresults into arrays. It allows us to omit calling function as we call to previously counted value and eliminates need for multiple counting the same result.However we cannot remember about advantages of recursion.

Eg a stronger block may make the ball stuck for a short time. Or bounce differently.Thanks for the link to composition. Had a read through and not sure I fully understand. Still on first year CS and its never been mentioned. The basic idea is that objects store pointers to their properties  which are passed in when constructed? This way they only have the methods they need specifically? Instead of having the whole inherited structure which may be unnecessary.

The copy assignment operator is invoked on an already existing and valid instance.

1988222,0,t3_2hglvh,Im more of a programming guy so correct me someone if I am wrong.A CPU basically takes two inputs code and data. Code is usually prewritten but data is typically users provided. It uses the code to perform certain operations on the data and generates an output which it stores back in memory which kind of memory is not important right now. Now it does this by reading machine code. Machine code is a bunch of ones and zeroes different combinations of which give us different instructions we can perform side note if any of your instructions has n digits you can have at max n unique machinecode instructions. You may wonder why they represent things in machine code which is a base  number system when base  or  or  would convey the information shorter and just as well. One reason is that instructions are stored in binary in memory so it makes sense they should be shown in binary as well.But the real reason is that the machine code is literally the combination in which the different components of the CPU should be switched on and off for that instruction to be performed. Different combinations of machine code leads to different components being on and off leads to different instructions. Hence machine code becomes a language in which you can program.TlDr last para.,learnprogramming,ckss56u,-1,t5_2r7yd

The fact that you can use words to represent an idea instead of using assembly is a level of abstraction.

2140756,0,t3_2jhpdd,. Efficiency. Time the solution in your use cases and pick the faster one. Techniques like Big O are useful for eyeballing differences in run time but ultimately you need to time it to really see whats faster since Big O etc doesnt take things like caching into mind. Memory is also something to keep in mind although often less important than performance.. Readability. This is usually the most important factor for the programmers as it affects how easily you can work with and maintain the code. Theres no quantitative way to choose here so pick whatever you find easiest.. Modularity and extensibility. How easy will it be to add new features to the code? Can it be easily changed? Is it modular ie can be kept mostly separated from the rest of the program? Modularity makes it easy to swap the code for a different solution and often affects the ability to change the code. Obviously its good to be able to change code easily.. Security. This isnt an issue for many kinds of solutions but for some real world problems you have to consider if a solution is more secure than another. For example you shouldnt store passwords in plain text even though that is much simpler to do.. Best practices. Kind of a catch all. Some kinds of solutions have established best practices that should be followed. Using the password example its expected that you salt and hash a password. Its also expected that you do not roll your own cryptography functions if youre not an expert in cryptography since introducing subtle bugs can completely ruin the algorithm. Theres a reason best practices exist. Unless you can find a good reason not to you should follow these best practices.    In some situations these best practices are more important than any of the other points. As mentioned passwords should be salted and hashed. If you dont do this your code will be more efficient more readable and probably easier to modify. Yet itd be very bad practice since if a malicious hacker obtains access to your database they have instant access to all passwords which may be used by other services thus by not salting and hashing passwords you fail your users.Do not worry about things like using less variables thats actually potentially a bad idea since it can adversely affect readability and extensibility or lines of code although lines of code probably correlate with readability.Also note that its quite common for solutions to be approximately equal in that neither one is necessarily better or worse than the other even though its different. Youll probably prefer your code in such cases since youre familiar with your coding style and you already know exactly how your code works although this does not mean your code is necessarily better than the other solution.,learnprogramming,clbxr6h,1,t5_2r7yd

2146216,0,t1_clcly6b,I got a little bit confused trying to follow your logic sorry so let me try to explain what that is doing.The  operator modulo or modulus is the remainder operator. It performs performs may not be technically correct  the actual implementation may vary but when thinking about it it may be easier to just assume its doing the following a division operation a  b and returns the remainder.Think back to when you did long division by hand and you did the division for the first number and then brought down the remainder until you got to the end and you had a remainder or not but thats still a remainder of zero. The modulo operator returns that remainder.          |          |            remainder So hopefully that helps a bit. A few things to keep in mind as general rules for what the results will be when using the modulo operator area  b  a if a lt ba  b   if a  ba  b lt b no matter whata     if a is evena   !  if a is oddThere are plenty more uses but you see those few a lot.Here are some examples showing how those work and maybe you can think of some more uses    def keepinrangeinput range      input  input  range    printkeepinrange   Prints     printkeepinrange   Value above the threshold! This will also print       remainder     printkeepinrange   This might not be what you expect but this will also print .    def isevenn      return n            iseven  True    iseven  False    iseven  True    def isoddn      return n   !     isodd  False    isodd  True    isodd  FalseOne place you see modulo used a lot is to make sure some number that may be greater than some value is kept below that value. Using Cs rand for example is often used together with the modulo operator.    include ltstdio.hgt    include ltstdlib.hgt    include lttime.hgt    int mainint argc char argv          srandtimeNULL      int randomnumber  rand        printfRandom number less than  dn randomnumber      return     So maybe that helps or maybe it confused you more!

You save an iteration through the keys this way but in most cases little things like this probably dont matter unless this is happening inside of a nested loop and the dictionary has  keys or something like that of course this is all situational,learnprogramming,clkrbn0,2,t5_2r7yd

WC doesnt look much better and is a nightmare to sift through but people still use it. wschools looks around the same. just cause it aint pretty doesnt mean it doesnt do its job. its not about believing anything either its about sharing resources and making up your own mind on whats relevant to you as an informed individual. i never said read Primer Plus its the only good book or TutorialsPoint is the only good website. There are tons and they all pretty much do the same thing. Teach. and FYI i read the FAQ it Just Says NO under C and C and aside from assembly its probably the closest you can get to the machine these days unless of course you build the device yourself. C created a lot of the apps we use today and C may be its own language in its own right but its still a derivative of C.

2220720,0,t3_2kjhb5,The problem with global variables is not so much that theyre global its that theyre mutable the value they contain can change over time.  Hardly anyone would call a global value that never changes bad or evil.  An example would be the name of your program.  If you have a value that should never changes     string PROGRAMNAME  MyProgramat the top of your program and that this value is used by multiple functions thats hardly a problem.  In fact its probably a good thing if you ever need to change the name of your program you have one place to modify instead of many.Now when global variables are mutable they introduce a time dependency between all the functions that access it even if they only access it for reading.  Consider the following example    int x      void f         x            void g         if x               printx is one                g   Doesnt print anything        f    g   prints x is oneAs you can see two identical calls to g yield two different results.  This is a simple example now imagine a program that would have dozens of global variables and hundreds of functions reading and modifying them.  You will eventually have a bug that manifests in a function foo and the cause is that someone modified the completely unrelated bar function despite the fact that both functions are completely unrelated.Mutable global variables are a big problem when you want to keep things modular which is why you should avoid them as much as is feasible.,learnprogramming,clm3ur4,10,t5_2r7yd

I guess uh that Ive made a mistake on calling this an Engine I was often told at school that the engine is the thing that makes your program run the Model in the MVC pattern whereas in the gaming industry it should be something more abstract like you explained  thanks for the article again  .What Im going to do is to rename this Engine class to Game. This Game class has an initialize a mainLoop and a terminate method.Ive been thinking about the last question if my systems should be singletons but I decided to put my SystemManager class as a singleton and a simple getter on a specified system should help me accessing it.Now for my other question I guess Ill stick with the EventMessagingSystem where my Game class will subscribe to a QUIT message type and would pass his method quit as a parameter. Then when the QUIT message is fired the quit method will be called.Now how do to that is the question I guess Ill be searching again on the internet EDIT Found it and it is working like a charm.

2374177,0,t1_cm55el9,So theres a difference between a different language and a language with a different usage case. What Im going to guess was meant by learn something significantly different is that you should learn something with a different mixture of programming paradigms Java for instance is imperative and objectoriented with a little bit of functional in there. A language like Python is functional and can be objectoriented or procedural. There are lots of other examples and a few directions you can go.If you want to learn a language with a different primary paradigm but that operates at around the same level as Java as a highlevel language Python or Ruby might be good places to look. Others may make other suggestions. If you want to learn a language that is closer to how computers actually process you might try learning C and then C they are in many ways similar to Java but with less handholding and padding separating you from the basic mechanics of how your system does things. Finally if your goal is to do something concrete you can learn about the suite of tools used to do that. I dont know about big data but for general statistics R or Stata are good choices. For web development youd probably want to start with HTMLCSS markup languages both and then JavaScript then learn about how to generate those with a web framework of some kind.Theres lots of options it all depends on what you want to do. ,learnprogramming,cm55nry,2,t5_2r7yd

2403979,0,t3_2mxeee,So the main thing you have to get used to in Node.js well anything asyncronous is understanding that your functions no longer run in a procedural order. This means where before you would call done after a loop will no longer work every time. Instead functions are passed around as parameters and ran in a hard to predict order. This is why everything has a call back third parameter of query.Its a race scenario. There is a chance NONE of them will finish before the loop ends calling done with  queries then there is the chance all the queries happen fast enough for them all to finish then obviously any amount in between as well.So a basic option would be to have a counter in fact you already have one rowsInserted. When that equals the number of rows you expect THEN you can call done. Though if one errors the query will have ran but not increased rowsInserted so you have to count every callback call error or not.That would get annoying anywhere you had to do it though so frodos answer uses the async module which I highly recommend. It has a ton of functions for handling this scenario where you want to apply a function to elements in an array and then a final callback once all have succeeded. I wont go in to too much detail though as its a rather large library.Though my ACTUAL solution in this case would be to just loop through the teams and build a SINGLE insert query. Its less taxing on the DB that way.,learnprogramming,cm8u9pr,2,t5_2r7yd

2434054,0,t1_cmchs12,gtAnyone wanna explain what exactly unit testing is?Unit testing is code exercise.  You write discreet tests that validate that a portion of your code with certain inputs produces the correct outputs.  A lot of unit testing code you will see out there is a bit hard to read usually because they are using some kind of framework for it that encapsulates the unit test in some way so the system can run them all easily. gtwhat exactly is unit coverage? how can it know how much code it covers? Unit coverage is how much of your code paths are being exercised and which ones arent.  You can know how much it covers by following the logic of your program and seeing if you have unit tests that call that code path.gt how does it even work? does it call your functions and such and verify the data it gets back is okay?Unit tests are in the simplest form a set of functions called against your code with assertions that validate the results.  Lets take an example.  I wrote myself a new myMaxa b function and I wanted to unit test it.  First lets define a simple wrapper around running tests    def runTeststests        for test in tests            print .formattest.name            try                test.execute            except                print Failed .formatsys.excinfo            else                print SuccessNow one test we could run is that myMaxa  should return a.  A unit test for that could look like this    class TestBIsZero        name  Max should return as value when b is zero.        def executeself            a              b              result  myMaxa b            assert result  a Result did not match as input valueYou would want to write coverage for all edge cases that your code should handle.  Does max handle negative numbers for a amp b?  Does it handle None correctly as either parameter?  As both?Finally you would then just build up the unit tests as a suite and run them all together.    def main        tests              TestBIsZero                runTeststests What you see in other unit testing frameworks is just a more complicated and robust version of this.  Usually they have some kind of class you can define that can have one or more tests and they have some way you invoke running the tests.  They often have a prescribed way that you notify the framework that your test was successful vs failure sometimes just with assertions as above sometimes with a done function.,learnprogramming,cmcjzts,9,t5_2r7yd

2506369,0,t1_cmllxn6,The reason that doesnt work in C is because when you give an argument to a function the function uses a copy of that argument instead of the argument itself. The copy is then gone after the function is over leaving your original x unmodified.So in your example function even though the value of x was changed to  the changed x was actually just a copy of the original x which was destroyed at the end of the function.In order to solve this we use pointers which are just variables which hold a memory address location. So you pass the function a pointer the address of x instead of the value of x and then you can modify the original x by dereferencing it in the function parameters.Sorry if that was written poorly Im also new to C so Im kind of writing this to help myself understand it better.,learnprogramming,cmlpymw,3,t5_2r7yd

Lets say you want to recover path from vertex f here is the code    currentvertex  f    while currentvertex ! nil         print currentvertex         currentvertex  picurrentvertexEDIT also typically you recover paths using dfs in similar fashion.

If not start there. If that is trivial add Bootstrap and some serverside validation. Still too easy? Build a more complex form like a hours worked tabular sheet. Maybe add some AJAX.

Or you can manually run the script through the bash interpreter as an argument bash script.sh.Here is a hint. The output of any command can be used by calling the command with the command operator or using command backticks though the former is recommended. For example    echo Hello my name is echo USER.which would output Hello my name is ynix.Youll want to experiment with extracting the output of the date command in a similar way possibly manipulating it further with some grep text filtering look into command piping.More information on just about everything you need is contained within the man pages that you can access on your command line here are some relevant programs that you should probably read up on    man bash    man date    man grep    man echo    man printf    man cal    man calendar,learnprogramming,cnf02ga,2,t5_2r7yd

Its real and looks simple enough to learn not just write random pieces of it for dollgames with my sister. I think that was at age of  or something. It was like discovering that your small spaceship is not a toy but an actual spaceship that can take you to the moon for real.So like in two years Ive learned Basic without PC or anything  totally by reading this book a lot rereading it then picking another book only one book Ive found in school library to find out am I missing some knowledge. And all simple code I write down in notebook was working only one way  I took pencil and another notebook and made all calculations by myself writing variables in column and moving step by step from line to line of code. Its hard to code something without chance to know if your code works  so I was pushed to check everything by myself like a live PC DNeedless to say that I was happy as noone in the world ever was when my parents gifted me a PC in age of  or something. At that time Ive somehow managed to find a physics teacher in school who was a programmer so he teached me Pascal a bit...Somehow Im very angry with myself that being a teenager Ive left programming and never coded again until age of  or . Ive turned to electronic music so partying as a DJ or with band took a huge part of my life with all those alcohol drugs and relationships...Anyway Im totally agreed. It was greatest experience of my life to learn everything by myself  reading rereading until I get it then trying it on practice if possible all with trialamperrors method until it finally works.Its a shame that often people complain about things without even giving it effort to do the thing not only in programming. Sometimes people even cant describe the problem  because they dont gather enough of errors and mistakes to figure out whats the problem IS. Nothing to talk about trying to find out the solution to build up your mind so you can analyze the problem by yourself and atleast choose the direction were solution may be.,learnprogramming,cnl1k9w,2,t5_2r7yd

And thats just to get it simply working. Getting it to work well is another thing entirely. Do you know how to properly secure communications between your server and your registers? Do you know how to secure your server and database in general?

Please enter a number ltlt endlThis prints out to the console a message and ends the line with endl so the consoles cursor will now be on the next line below your text.Second.  Read the value of x.  You want to now read in a number that will be your value of x.    int x    cin gtgt xHere you first create an integer variable named x that you will want to store the users input into.  Then take in the users input and store it into x.Third.  Compute value of y as y      x   This is a standard math problem so solve for y using the given value x.    int y        x  Simply input your variable x where you would in the equation and store the result into an integer y.Fourth. Display the value of x and y.  You want to print out a string to the console showing the user what the values of x and y are in the format given.  So output a string like before however you need to insert the values of x and y where appropriate.    cout ltlt Computed value of y for x   ltlt x ltlt  is  ltlt yedit Heres the code in an ideone to look at  ,learnprogramming,cnvoebt,3,t5_2r7yd

C is a language intended to be very close to the hardware sitting on a very thin abstraction layer. There is a very direct relationship between the code you type and what the computer does. Its useful for lowlevel programming such as in operating system kernels device drivers and embedded systems programming. On the other hand it makes C a very explicit verbose language that can require a lot of code to do things that seem simple.gtdo you have a quicker way to operate on all elements of an array? i was going to write    for int i Vi !   i        ltVi operationgt    gti took that from another forum it would be a good code block to have. from what i can see it would run through all elements of V until it funds a null i think at which it would terminate the loopThis isnt going to work since you dont have a null at the end of your array the last element of your array contains . Also null is what you call the  character typically. The same value  when its an int is usually just called zero.  Additionally you have a space inside your character literal   which would mess things up.Loop up to the length of the array instead. If you want to use an array declared without an explicit length like in your example you can calculate the number of elements in it by taking the size of it with sizeof and dividing by the size of an element sizeofVsizeofV.,learnprogramming,coeq73b,3,t5_2r7yd

You sent me the link to the software  .Are you approaching this project from a technical perspective? With a statement like so I wasnt aware I even could port the same functionality to a different language youve got more fundamental concerns to research before you can think about performance. Were you expecting to run Matlab code on an iPhone?I already assumed you had your ducks in a row about implementation feasibility and other concerns like patents.Matlab aside from providing a language convenient for array and matrix operations and a good visual environment also provides a toolkit of various numerical and related algorithms. If the source code depends on one of the Matlab implemented numerical algorithms you have to be able to implement that effeciently yourself.I downloaded the source code and had a quick scan. It looks like the processing kernels are in their own C code and theres not that much of it which is a positive sign.It looks their claim of realtime is based on an expectation that of two things. One that the implementation is run a high end desktop CPU or on a GPU that can properly support GPGPU. Two that its possible to create an implementation x  x faster or more when optimized. You dont have the first on a phone so you basically have to make a highly optimized version with more than x performance gain.,learnprogramming,cogwtzz,2,t5_2r7yd

First of all any decent compiler should produce exactly the same code for n   and n amp xF.

I know that stuff has to be stored in memory if it is going to be kept and I am thinking that the constant retrieval from memory for comparison would potentially be slower than having the processor just run the math...but it still has to do math on at least three static integers so maybe the difference would be irrelevant because it already has to deal with retrieving a few stored pieces.What I think I really want to do is get the solid numbers stored in the processors cache or something so that it only has to retrieve data about the portion of the array it is working on but my skill level is somewhere around  of an educated programmers at best ,learnprogramming,cohelyz,1,t5_2r7yd

3220913,0,t3_2x0i3t,My understanding of your question is when do you allocate memory with a new or other dynamic allocation method vs. using an instance within the function on the stack.  Is that correct?Assuming it is  you need to understand the difference between what the two declarations do.  Using new allocates memory off the heap which means no memory management but what you give it  as uJonnyThan points out  you dont delete it so it is leaked  once the function ends no pointer to that memory remains that you can access so its no longer available to you.  Im assuming this is a badinC habit from Java programming which handles memory management for you. Youll have to remember to pair a delete with every new!Using the version of allocation that you show with trig allocates the same amount of memory ish but on the stack.  The stack is a chunk of memory set aside for the program to store frames  all the data related to a given function call.  As you call functions the stack becomes more full with info about where to return to and new allocations for memory used in the called function.  As functions return the stack empties out.So where in memory the data lives and what compilersupported memory management it comes with is one aspect of your decision.A more subtle but equally important aspect is when the constructor is called.  In the case you give with both being declared inside a function body nothing unusual happens  the constructors are called in the sequence you expect.  However if you use a global instance of a Triangle and a Triangle  the instance will have its constructor called at some point during program start precisely when depends on your system.  The pointer wont have its ctor called until you call new.Lastly determining which to use can depend on if you know how many instances you want to create.  Can you think of circumstances when you might not be able to determine at compile time how many instances of a given class you need?,learnprogramming,covume9,1,t5_2r7yd

3280905,0,t3_2xpfww,I think  must be a great age to start if you feel the urge to program and if you enjoy doing it. I wish I had done some programming back then... I recently got into it though and started from scratch. I did not know what a variable was and I couldent have named a single language would have named HTML as one though. I started off doing the JS courses at CodeAcademy and I ran that  times until i understood what was going on in the code. Then I started reading up. For me personally I would not have been able to understand and appreciate what i read without that practical start. After some reading I downloaded VS Express and made all the stuff I had done in JS again in C  now with a UI. Paper rock scissors and blackjack and that kind of stuff. At that point I had a slight grasp of the basics and then found some for me ambitious projects to do. My experience is that I only really learn when I do it. Then I read about how i should have done it and the next time I do it better. Now I fiddle around with Xamarin and iOS and Android apps. Its a greeeeat time! I enjoy it more than i ever did video games. So anyways my advice is to not spend too much time deciding how to move forward. Just jump in and start coding! Once you get the basic basics everything is so much easier. If you go C and get stuck feel free to PM me.Edit PS! And coding is kind of like snowboarding. In the beginning its all frustration and falling on your ass every  seconds. Power through! One day your racing down the slopes and everything feels great.PS! PS! You keep falling on your ass occasionally. I still do every  sec  both in coding and snowboarding. But it feels great inbetween.,learnprogramming,cp290a8,1,t5_2r7yd

3341489,0,t1_cp91ly4,Okay i think we are talking about two different things when we say pointers and arrays are not equal. While you apparently are talking about how as you say correctly arrays are allocated memory and the programmer has to take care of all the memory that he allocated which is true. and yes even if you call a function and this array is the argument... the memory after the pointer aka pointerx still is the same object the array. Meanwhile i was talking aboutmeant that the computerassuming compiler does not do some improvements sees it as a pointer if you use it as function argument. void fooint ptr some function code  ptr in this function is still nothing but a pointer to int even if you give that function an array. Its to programmers responsibility what to do with the memory after ptraka ptrx. But whether the programmer needs to ensure something or not after all this is just a pointerwith the addition that the programmer knowsneeds to knowneeds to take care of what comes after that initial address.     sry for my bad english i was on my phone before i hope its better now.,learnprogramming,cp95kki,1,t5_2r7yd

3355746,0,t3_2ykpk5,Every responder will have a different way of doing this but what I would do is since you are catching exceptions in the entry point anyway is bubble up a custom exception wrapping the ones you are trapping. That is make a class called FailedToSaveException and call it with your println messages and the exception you caught inner exception and catch only that in your main.The act of calling the method saveDB is relatively atomic that is you cant partially save a DB with the method and that is probably the intent. With this in mind you could alternately just have it return true or false but then you lose the extra information the exception provides. What you dont want to do except for debugging purposes is unnecessary io leave that to the method which called saveDB to begin with.The general idea is you catch exceptions if there is no other way to check for failure for example .NET has Integer.Parse which throws an exception on failure but also provides TryParse which returns a boolean. Parsing an integer is relatively atomic again you wont halfparse it.File IO has a larger number of failure points so it is helpful to the user to gather some extra information to pass to them when reporting the problem but notification should be handled by whoever called saveDB in your case not by saveDB itself. To summarize move all your exception handling into the saveDB method and if the exception cannot be recovered from bubble up a custom failure exception and report any failure from main and not saveDB.,learnprogramming,cpas2u4,1,t5_2r7yd

Similarly...gtIn turn would getEquation and getAnswer also use a b and c as parameters since it needs the same information or would it use something else that I would write into next?No theyre both parameterless. They all use the instance variables a b and c... but not as parameters. Next sets a b and c as well as the operands but you havent done that yet and the two get functions gets them.gtWhat would the return type of next be if its just there to generate the equation not solve or print it? It can just be void. Alternatively though this is probably NOT what your professor wants you to do next could return a new MathGenerator object that has a new equation thereby allowing your variables to be immutable.gtWould I set up something like d  a  b  c only with random operands and operators inside of next and then pass d on to getAnswer and the rest into getEquation?I dont understand this. In my opinion you should randomly generate a b and c using ints then generate the two operands and all five variables are instance variables. Both get methods will have to parse what the equation means and then just generate the string or the answer.gtWhat function would I use to randomize the operators as well as the numbers?Thats the next function you have to write and you should probably just call next in your constructor to avoid duplicating code. You just basically have to do a coin flip and if its heads its one operator and if its tails its the other operator do this twice. Then save that state.,learnprogramming,cpf2dcr,2,t5_2r7yd

The main reason Python is not very popular in finished products is that it tends to run slower than compiled C or JIT Java C languages but you can get around that by compiling the Python into another language using the Cython Jython or Iron Python compilers for example. Python wont set you back.

You are naming your variables files and you are giving it private privilege access.public MusicOrganizer  files  new ArrayListltStringgt This is a method. Inside the method you are indeed actually using the variable you just declared earlier. You are now initializing it or giving it a value.If you are wondering what this all does on a low level you are probably using the wrong language. Java is made as an abstract language you dont have to think about how things work they do.Whats really happening is you are creating a new arraylist its being put in memory somewhere could be  bytes  bytes I honestly dont know what the default size of an arraylist is. Then you are applying to the variable youve created. Everything in java is pass by reference I honestly dont know enough about it but if its similar to C youll have an address to the memory of the Arraylist but this is all nonsense Im sure someone else who knows the JVM can chime in.|| Is called logical OR operator. Its similar to the English Exclusive OR I went to the store or I went home. Exclusive OR basically says you either went to the store or you went one. Pick one. Its common how we say it in English. Normal OR this is the truth table    A B | OR      |        |        |        |  Basically if any one of the two statements is true the conditional is true.AND is  and  gives .OR is  or  gives . Remember logical not exclusiveNOT just makes s s trues falses.A local variable is a variable defined in the local scope vs say the global scope.If I haveint ipublic Class....i can be accessed anywhere barring maybe static methods in the program. It has file scope I believe again not a big Java guy.Any method has access and can change it.But local variables those created in methods are creating when the method is instantiated stay in the method are used and then get deleted. The file or global variables stay until the program terminates. Essentially its more memory efficient to make new variables when you call a method than to just have s of variables sitting in the global namespace.Sorry some of my points arent probably  accurate Im sure others can correct me but this is a gist of how I believe it works in java and Im sure my points arent that far off.,learnprogramming,cpzv44n,1,t5_2r7yd

3638739,0,t3_321p0q,A modern smart phone probably has the CPU disk and memory resources to be able to do at least basic programming.The problem is  it has a very shitty keyboard input and very shitty display.  Even the most basic programming requires being able to enter and parse highdensity information ie source code and you just cant do that on a phone display.  I get that you might think that something is better than nothing... but dude Id go batshit insane trying to program on a phone.  Now maybe if you had a bluetooth keyboard you might be able to stave off the insanity long enough to actually accomplish something.I dont know what your financial situation and access to technology looks like so please dont be offended if Im way off the mark here... but I will point out you definitely do not require any kind of modern beefy hardware to do basic programming.  Id actually say even a  would be a better programming experience than a smart phone  as long as it has a keyboard and monitor!

3641251,0,t3_322f6a,Some people do agree that the use of getters and setters is convoluted.The problem however is when inheritance is concerned. We cant override a field. We can override methods and thus can override getters and setters. Of course theres no need to use getters and setters everywhere then but some people consider it good practice because it ensures that if you ever have to change things eg you want to calculate a value from others instead of as a field of its own then all the users of the code youve written will work with the new code.If you had to add getters and setters and hide the field you just broke all the existing code. If the existing code is your own you have more work to do. If its a library you made it much harder to upgrade versions backwards incompatibilities in libraries should be minimized.Its not that bad of a practice. If its your own code ie not a library go ahead and skip getters and setters. At least in Java. Some other languages have better ways to handle this. For example in JavaScript you usually dont seem to have getters and setters but in fact theres special hidden getters and setters. Although to keep code clean you probably want to avoid using them.In Scala the norm is not to use getters and setters but this is largely because regular fields are treated like functions Scala lets you skip the parenthesis so you could have person.getAge instead of Javas person.getAge. And in fact assignment to fields calls a special function so when you do person.age   youre actually calling person.age. However you cant override these so theres still the need for real getters and setters. Theyre not the norm in Scala however because the norm is to not have mutable public fields. Conventions n all.,learnprogramming,cq7bw5n,2,t5_2r7yd

3648781,0,t1_cq86hnp,gt  What youre talking about is called localization and Visual Studio already has tools built in for handling this problem. Let me warn you its a pretty huge topic since it covers a lot more than just changing up strings but thats definitely one of the components of it.Start here Basically youre going down the right track you define resource files which are basically just xml files. In the resource file you identify all of the strings youre going to need to localize and then in your application rather than setting the text directly you ask the resource to load the correct value for the users currently selected culturelanguage. That way your app can respond when the user switches their culture via the operating system so when your app runs they dont have to pick a languageI know you can program it like that. But I am not that experienced a programmer I just want it to change the strings when I select an Index in a drop down menu.Also I was kind of thinking of using the same method for the calculations part because while the options are one thing their values are going to be something else. ,learnprogramming,cq86s8r,1,t5_2r7yd

Thus if you didjava playerkills Enter data West Nolan  donethen args  Enter args  data args  West args  nolan args  Nolan args  done.ampnbspOnce you have those arguments you can figure out how you want to format your data.ampnbspOnce you have this data you want it to be stored somewhere so you can get it back when you want. I recommend you look into Javas File library. You can store your strings of data directly onto the file.ampnbspOther thoughtsampnbsp. How you store it doesnt matter although instead of using a multidimensional array I really suggest you look into HashMaps  and private classes although if you want to learn how to use a HashMap effectively you will need to learn how to implement a good hashCode. Sorry this is a bit more off topic. A multidimensional array will work just fine although it wont be as optimized not that it matters unless youre putting in   entries.ampnbsp. If you wanted to store your data better instead of using file input and output look into javas Serializable This can directly store your data structures although it only works with objects that implement the Serializable interface such as arrays and HashMaps.ampnbsp. All of these suggestions seem like a lot to learn but you will use this in the future in some capacity I believe.

However let me give you an example of the rabbit hole Im currently jumping into.The other day while making my application I wanted the user to be able to click a link and receive a prompt where the navigation would then branch to this page or that page. How you do this depends on a few things Is it a WinForm app? Use DialogResult class.Is it a Windows Phone  app? Use MessageBox class. Is it Windows . StoreWindows Phone . app? Use MessageDialog class. While MessageBox class comes with yesno properties out the gate MessageDialog does not and you have to create them. MessageDialog is also asynchronous whatever that is that affects its behavior and how you use it but i dont know how.Then there is the whole issue of page navigation. Ive been designing my app around basic pages with hyperlinking between pages only to discover I have to use a Pivot page because Microsoft wants to use Panorama style navigation for all the apps.

However on the whole they cannot compete with books for a number of reasons.  Books take months sometimes years of careful planning and editing.  You can make notes in the margin place bookmarks and you can skip around to the place you need.  They can be easily updated as APIs and best practices evolve.  They come in the form of cookbooks reference manuals crash courses or in the case of Clean Code revolutionary tools in the way you think about programming.App inventors vs NativeAdmittedly I havent tried OPs linked app inventor but these magical Write apps for every device without needing to learn how to write code!!! come up quiet often.  They make a splash nothing come of them and then they fade into obscurity. The reason for this is that they are tunnel visioned.  It gets disinterested students feeling good about themselves by producing results but unlike traditional tools they fall over quickly outside of their problem domain. Native tools provide a framework for solving problems whereas code creation tools provide a shortcut for building a set of solutions.How to really learn to codeThere are no two ways about this.  You have to code.  Its a skill that takes patience persistence and above all practice. You will get frustrated bamboozled and feel the pang of imposter syndrome.  You will also feel like a magician a king a god!  You will never not be a student or run out of things to learn nor reach a point your skills cannot be improved.

3885585,0,t1_cqz221d,Youre definitely trying to jump in at the deep end here.  If youre serious about undertaking this project I would recommend picking up a copy of Computer amp Machine Vision Theories Algorithms Practicalities by E.R. Davies.Isolating objects from photographs is a very difficult problem.  In an image you have three color channels intensities in those color channels and adjacency information and from that you have to extrapolate an understanding of the scene.  Typically object extraction works best against a known or simple background where large differences in color or intensity allow the image to be binarized and thresholded to identify pixels of interest.In the absence of a known or simple background youre left with trying to pull out every trick you know but much of it is image dependent.  And the fact that youre new to this means you probably dont know a whole lot of tricks yet or maybe any.Essentially what youre going to need to do is try to find ways to discard regions of the image that arent what youre looking for.  Unfortunately the objects youre interested in are of arbitrary size and shape and the only thing they really have in common is a somewhat bounded thickness and kindof uniform color.If I were you I would start by trying to binarize the image.  The roads in this one sample image are light so try a bunch of thresholds until you find one that blots out most of the image except for the roads.  Be warned that a threshold that works on one image may not work on another.This process should leave you with a lot of black pixels and some number of white pixels arranged in different sorts of shapes.  From here you will need to identify regions based on adjacency and start filtering out ones that dont have the right sort of shape.  Once youve blacked out those poorly shaped regions youll want to use the remaining white pixels as a hint of parts of the original image to search.  Youll look back at the original image for the color and gradient change expected of the roads and try to find the pixel coordinates of the centers.The two things you have going for you are that  you wont need to find all roads to have something to match against only some of them and  the roads and streams that youre interested in will mostly cross the border of the image at some point which may let you narrow your starting search and then expand inward using adjacency with an already determined road pixel as an indicator or precondition for each further step.,learnprogramming,cqz6uyj,2,t5_2r7yd

Additionally they provide features for searching reading and updating only the information you want instead of loading up everything. Now you dont have to write code to search all your data structures for that one class instance you wanted.There are many more features that modern databases support from backing up data to efficiently storing huge amounts of data to crazy fast search.

3922395,0,t1_cr3d8ff,I think there is a misunderstanding here. You are talking about development programming given a specific problem working on it until it matches the given purpose and works well. The other posters are talking about software engineering. Given a large problem break it down into subtasks. Which can also be useful when working on personal projects.By for example planning out how to allocate complicated shared data structures ahead of time what the design of certain systems are etc. These solutions are based on empirical evidence we just dont rediscover all the failed solutions every time. Instead we use the evidence of other software engineers trying it of previous designs within the same company of computer scientists researching it etc.Agile methods are designed to make it easier for a project to swap up something which turned out to not be working but most design processes have feedback mechanisms designed to deal with design problems that come up during development.Personally I find doing design work ahead of time to be much more effective even for my small personal projects than test driven development. I find having a well laid out design for key components ahead of time allows me to write the whole thing without even running it once although sometimes I do run parts of it in an adhoc test driven development way to ensure my understanding of a particular thing is correct and only have a couple of syntax errors when I finish it. At which point I basically do use test driven development to work out any remaining kinks which I rarely find. But thats my personal anecdotal experience.Consider how the space shuttle team wrote software and always met their estimates although I guess there is an argument that they are just one of the largest TDD teams in history. When we start talking about software that large there has to be design laid out in advance. Tests are always useful. And sure test driven development has merit in many situations. But its development not design.,learnprogramming,cr3e0rc,5,t5_2r7yd

Knowing the difference between C and C beyond the fact that theyre totally different languages doesnt really matter if youre only using one of them and no one honestly expects someone to know the size of an empty class except that interviewer I guess.However you definitely should be very familiar with OOP. The structure and design of programs is very important and nobody wants a coworker that doesnt understand the core concepts of programming of which OOP is one.By the way you know that dynamic programming is an algorithm technique right? Its more of a CS thing than a programmer thing. Its quite important because the algorithms that one uses can mean massive differences in performance. Its pretty standard to be asked about data structures and algorithms. Theyre pretty much the hallmark of a good programmer.To be honest the fact that youre focusing so much on C when you seem to lack a strong understanding of CS I see beginners overplay the importance of the language a lot and downplay the importance of algorithms makes me think you might be interviewing for positions currently beyond you. Interviews that would ask about things like dynamic programming dont sound quite like the average junior programmer position.The other grad student sounds like he might lack tact but might not be entirely barking up the wrong tree. What kinds of courses have you taken? Is it is just one class or have you taken several? Because more will certainly help. In particular classes on software engineering and algorithms and data structures are a good idea. One class is usually not enough. You wouldnt hire a mathematician who only took calc I would you?Anyway interviewers dont expect you to get every question right. Some questions in fact are just to see your thought process. So speak what youre thinking.

Down in San Diego myself.I ended up going back to college for multiple reasons. First math requirements for a bio major are substantially lower than a CompSci major. I only had to take Calc I  Calc II i.e. single variable only whereas CompSci required that  Calc III Discrete Math Linear Algebra etc. On top of that I took my math courses my freshman year of undergrad so there was a yr gap between then and when I went into CompSci so obviously I forgot everything. My first day of retaking Calc II I realized I forgot how to differentiate.So given that alone it made sense to take those classes at a community college rather than go for a Masters Itd cost significantly less to take introremedial classes. If I went for Masters Id have to take those math courses anyways only the price would be over x more expensive. Also from a more personal aspect I can go to community college anywhere whereas Id have to move to wherever I get into for a Masters program and Id much prefer to be in San Diego. Theres no guarantee I can get into UCSD or SDSU for a Masters program. Actually I take that back I almost definitely cannot get into UCSD for a Masters program. It also works out pretty well too. I just finished my math courses took every CompSci course at city college down here and still have a lot of free time. Because of that Ive been crashing CSE courses at UCSD. Data Structures Algorithms mobile dev etc. I obviously wont get credit for it but Ive been learning a ton and that knowledge will put me ahead of the curve for when I do transfer in. Not sure what part of LA youre in but you can def do the same with UCLA and USC.As far as jobs go theres a good amount in SoCal. Theres the typical tech SDE jobs down here in SoCal. I know Google  Amazon  Microsoft have offices in some combination of San Diego LA and Orange County.

4004627,0,t3_36c4bd,I assume that despite using languages that are functional you either havent actually used functional programming or are unaware that youre using it.Functional programming has a single core requirement functions are first class citizens. Usually this means that you can store functions in variables and pass them around just like any other variable. Therell usually be a special type for functions possible with something as specific as  function that takes in an int and returns a string in C this is Funcltint stringgt and in Scala its Int gt String.This is very powerful because it allows for a variety of patterns. For example if we have an asynchronous function meaning that it will be executed in parallel with return being handed back to the caller before the function finishes executing then one way to do something after this function is done is by using a callback which is a function that we pass in and the asynchronous function will call it. Im gonna provide an example using JavaScript and will try and comment the language specific parts And in other languages you can actually make functions that are truly asynchronous JS is single threaded so its not possible in JS but other languages can create a new thread and execute the function in that thread.Now that was just a toy example. Heres some real world cases. Execute some code when a part of the GUI is clicked. These are called events. The typical way to do this is to supply a function that has to be called. Nonfunctional languages usually pass in an object with a certain method that can be called older versions of Java do this such as with Swing. In a sense thats basically like functional programming but with a lot of boilerplate. This is called the command pattern. Other nonfunctional languages might just generate the code hooking up functions to events on the fly eg by searching for a function with a certain name or by having you override certain methods. IMO its a lot cleaner to just pass in a single function.    Especially since many languagesframeworks will actually let you add a function to a list of event handlers so that you can have multiple handlers that are executed in order. This is also possible with the command pattern but messier with overriding methods in the caller.. Theres a number of generic higher level functions which are functions that take in other functions that are very useful for a variety of tasks. The most common is probably map which takes in some kind of collection and applies a function to each item in the collection returning a new collection with the results. A simple example is if you have a list of integers you could have a function that increments each integer ie functionx  return x    and then using this with map would get you the list with all integers incremented by one.    Another example is the filter function which also works on lists. It takes in a function that judges if an item should be in the resulting list. Thus it lets you remove items that do not satisfy some predicate a predicate is a function that returns boolean.    Heres an example. Suppose we have a list of employees and we want to get the names of employees that earn more than  as a salary. Lets assume that employees are objects stored in a collection called employees and this object has fields for name and salary. Then our code to get the list of names would be         This is Scala code        employees          .filteremployee gt employee.salary gt           .mapemployee gt employee.name         JS equivalent note that the next version of JS will have syntax closer         to the above Scala code. I included this so its obvious how the Scala         code is using functions when it isnt immediately obvious from the syntax.        employees          .filterfunctionemployee  return employee.salary gt            .mapfunctionemployee  return employee.name . Higher level functions can be used for a variety of business logic codes. This is really just an extension of above where we had some very generic higher level functions. Similarly you could create more specific higher level functions. For example suppose we had a library that displays a calendar. We might want to have a callback that is called whenever a date in the calendar is rendered and this would provide us with a DateCell object that we could provide styles to or similar eg we could use them to populate a list of what days are displayed.Also worth mentioning is that many functional languages like to favour immutability. However this is not a requirement for a language to be functional. Java C C and JavaScript are all functional yet do not require immutability at all and in fact favour mutability. As you can probably tell from that list this also means that functional languages can also be object oriented. Scala is a strong example of a language that combines functional programming with OO very well. In Scala everything is an object including functions and what Java calls primitives so integers are objects. Scala actually favours immutability preferring that you declare variables with val which makes them immutable but also letting you create mutable variables when you need them with the var keyword.All the same some languages have gone away with mutability. Haskell is the best known example. In Haskell everything is immutable. This however causes problems. How do you interact with the world when the real world is mutable? Writing to a file or changing a GUI requires immutability. Haskell gets around this by having an IO type that sort of encapsulates side effects allowing the language to be immutable while the particular implementation of certain things like this IO type to not be immutable. I wont go into depth here because immutability is separate from functional programming if commonly associated with it.EDIT Oh yeah I forgot about currying. Currying lets you take a function that has multiple arguments and build it up by binding the first argument or first few arguments. For example suppose we had a function add x y this is Haskell syntax. We could use currying to create a new function that adds  to a function increment  add  and since add needs another argument so does increment. We can then do increment  to get .This raises an interesting point. In Haskell the type signature of add would be Int gt Int gt Int or similar  I dont want to go into the type system in depth. This can be read as Int gt Int gt Int or takes an int and maps it to a function that takes an int and returns an int. So after we supply the first int what we get back is another function with type Int gt Int which means it takes in an int and returns an int which obviously is what increment does. The usefulness of currying is that we can create new functions easily from existing ones. For example suppose we wrote a general purpose quicksort function. It needs to be given a means of comparing two elements since often times we sort complex types that dont have an obvious way of figuring out their order. So we need to supply a lessThan predicate that can be used to compare two elements in Java the ComparableltTgt and ComparatorltTgt types are used for this.Suppose that we want a variant of quicksort that can compare integers. We could use currying to provide such a function by using our existing general purpose quicksort and currying the lessThan predicate in. So if the general purpose quicksort has signature quicksort lessThan list we might use intQuickSort  quicksort someFunctionComparingIntegers.As an aside its common to treat operators as functions. So the less than operator is actually a function. In Haskell we could use that like intQuickSort  quicksort lt. The parenthesis are so that the function uses prefix notation instead of infix notation infix notation would be x lt y while prefix would be lt x y  as you can tell functions in code usually use prefix.,learnprogramming,crcrbct,27,t5_2r7yd

4060003,0,t3_371iq4,gtAm I thinking too small about this?Yes you are thinking locally to the class or family of classes that implement the interface. What you should instead consider is the calling code that uses these objects. Ideally the calling code doesnt need to know whether or not it is dealing with a dog or bird or goat. All it needs to do is call the sleep action on some object passed to it. So what is passed in should be the type of the interface instead of a concrete type like Dog.If a new requirement for an animal comes along like chicken you have no need to change that calling code because it only receives the interface. Amplify this across hundreds of methods and you might see a benefit to interfaces.Since Java is strongly typed interfaces are necessary.,learnprogramming,crj2jp6,2,t5_2r7yd

You start with making sure the cache headers for the browser is set up correct and only expire the cache if your asserts change.  You use CDNs to load javascript content and images on a different cookieless domain. Application side you need to have several layers of caching including Output caching caching the rendered final html data access caching any hit to the DB should be cached and lastly code level caching of expensive calculationals memoization. With that said all these need to be in out of process cache. Simply storing it in memory is bottleneck and wont scale. Something like a Redis cluster would be perfect.

4144919,0,t1_crspr36,Floating point doesnt just mean a number with a decimal place  it refers specifically to the fact that the decimal point can float allowing for a variable number of digits before and after the decimal point.  Because you still have to represent all these numbers with a finite number of bits  if youre talking about a bit floating point number for example this leads to what we perceive as rounding errors but are in fact a necessary consequence of us trying to represent numbers with varying precision using a finite amount of space.This is bad if we want our arithmetic to be exact.  For example with floating point number this expression evaluates to false    .    .Dont believe me? Now think about what that means if youre trying to keep track of something exact like change or any kind of money.  Most things wont add up as you expect although enough will that you kindasorta think its working.Instead you want to use a fixed point number format where the number of digits after the decimal is fixed beforehand.  Some languages support this natively others support it in their standard library via some kind of decimal type as its usually called and others like C dont support it at all unless you build it yourself.But a quickndirty way to handle this specific situation is to not count your money in potentiallyfractional dollars but in cents which are always nonnegative integers.  Then theres no rounding that happens at all or that you need to worry about because all your addition multiplication division etc. are integer operations.Dont even bother trying to convert the user input into a floating point number the user input will be arriving as a string after all.  If the user enters anything that doesnt look like ltintegergt.ltdigitgtltdigitgt then yell at them.  If they do enter something valid convert it directly to cents by removing the period.  . is  cents  you dont need to worry about any kind of math at all floating point or otherwise.,learnprogramming,crsqkcp,3,t5_2r7yd

4201655,0,t3_38zc7q,Heres what I wish I understood when I started programming in  sentences. A computer receives stores and manipulates information.. Programmers refer to information as data.. Data can be structured to represent concrete things  a song a picture a street address an entire telephone book.. Data can also represent abstract things such as the relationships between you and all of your friends. . Computers can only store data that can be represented as a collection of numbers.. This is where all those Zeroes and Ones come from  they are how the computer stores numbers.. Programmers write code which is itself a kind of data to tell a computer how to manipulate data.. Programmers break data manipulations into small understandable steps and then compose the steps together.. Programmers create abstractions by finding patterns in code and giving those patterns or ideas a name and often a theoretical background.. Programmers gain productivity by layering abstractions at the cost of not understanding or controlling the entire system.This really helps me think about coding as the process of writing data transformers. If I can represent something as data then I can manipulate transmit and store a representation of that thing. I can allow users to control how the data is manipulated through a user interface.It also helps me gain clarity around my next steps. What data do I need to accomplish the task? Where does that data live and where does it need to be? How can I get the data that I need from the data that I have or from the people who interact with my code.Perhaps most importantly it helps me grapple with leaking abstractions  and it helps me understand that there is always some cost paid for the abstraction whether its a lack of control over a programs runtime environment with garbage collection for example or merely a more complex compiler or interpreter.Its never necessary to understand EVERYTHING that a computer is doing but when something unexpected happens it is important to be able to peel back the abstraction onion and figure out where ones mental model of a computational task diverges from reality.,learnprogramming,crz6iu3,233,t5_2r7yd

I know someone has told me to choose between web dev mobile dev and software dev. Are those the big options for now? I was considering doing web dev but honestly get the feeling its going to be oversaturated soon with all the bootcamps and other things. mobile dev seems interesting but not sure that is a right decision either.

You just contradicted yourself man...gt But if you think taking a database or opengl elective isnt helpful youre got youre pretty clueless.I go to work every morning and get paid and I havent coded a single line of OpenGL ever. Not really needed in most of Programming work if you arent in Graphics. Databases are good but you can also learn them yourself instead of sitting in class. There are many self taught programmers at my work.gt  And your comment is pretty irrelevant.And your comment was total shitgt He asked about getting an internship not about how to be a professional programmer.Its not like interns are not professional programmers. You wake up in the morning go to work and get paid. Isnt that the definition of a professional? Sure you arent a Senior Developer but you are still a paid worker exceptions unpaid interns but Im sure hed rather be a paid one.

4316693,0,t3_3afrmm,Well for this particular case where the number of metrics isnt very large thousands is nothing to a modern computer and the search is quite simple seems that you just have names and manually assigned tags to search for you wouldnt need too much. Since most of the names and tags are probably nouns you cant really benefit from a synonym or lexeme based search and thus can do a simple case insensitive string comparison.That is youd be looping through all the results like Assuming metrics is an array of objects in the form name Foo tags tag tagsearchResults  for metric in metricsif metric.name.contains querysearchResults.add metricelsefor tag in metric.tagsif tag.contains querysearchResults.add metricbreak display the searchResultsOf course youd need some way to create the tags. A prototype should skip the tags. Theyll be a lot more work to implement because everything else could be done entirely client side with JS. You could either push the entire list to a JSON file and manually add the tags easiest or you could implement a server that provide an interface to do so with a database. As you can tell having a database and an interface to modifyadd tags is obviously a lot more complex than just searching names.EDIT Oh yes and you could do this very easily with minimal effort on your part with the DataTables library. It has filtering aka searching pagination and sorting right off the bat. Just have to structure your data as a table and apply the library. Easy peasy.,learnprogramming,csc7vr0,1,t5_2r7yd

It ships on that board because it has a lot of components that make it easier to program the microcontroller. Once you have programmed it you can pull out the microcontroller from the board and run your project with it. Dont worry about the programmer its just another component that already comes builtin on the circuit board.see this  For compilers I use CCS code composer studio it has a nice interface and IDE. You can also use mspgcc which I think youre looking for. The nice thing about MSP is you can program in assembly CC or even the Arduino languageusing Energia dont recommend it.The power source can be a USB connection comes with the board to your computer or can be external like a battery just make sure the voltage is about VgtIve been doing more research.

4376894,0,t3_3b5ab6,Totally depends on the kind of bot.. The simplest bots would simply click at certain coordinates at certain times. Nothing more than basic scripting of the mouse movements and keyboard inputs. This is pretty easy for the engine to detect. In fact theres whole captcha systems that work by simply identifying mouse movements as humanlike.. More advanced bots would use color pickers to identify what theyre supposed to click. Many games got good at thwarting these by avoiding the colors being the exact same and detecting patterns in the clicking.. Even more advanced is object detection in computer vision. This is very difficult to do efficiently though. The problem is that detecting objects is hard and slow. For comparison I wrote an implementation of the hough transform for my CV class that detected white circles of various radiuses on a black background. Despite this simple image the run time of the algorithm was about half a minute. Of course it wasnt designed to work in real time and the algorithm is a naive one that makes no presumptions about the image and has to deal with possible overlapping.    Theres more specific techniques that can be used to gain efficiency. My point is simply to demonstrate how hard it is to do detection of even simple objects. Machine learning such as a neural network approach would certainly produce a more efficient solution but neural networks require training. Thats time consuming and difficult to implement.. The bot could detect calls to the graphics engine eg DirectX which allows it to know where things are simply because it knows how things are being rendered. This is probably most common amongst the more sophisticated bots.,learnprogramming,csj0fj8,3,t5_2r7yd

4395564,0,t3_3bd93w,. The various gaming tools will do quite a bit with draganddrop level design but ultimately youll find yourself needing some kind of behavior that isnt explicitly defined in the engine and thats where youll write your own code.  Generally these environments offer an API which is highly integrated with the environment so if you know how programming works youre really focused on the objects and methods exposed by that API.. C is a very lowlevel language meaning it is great for working directly with memory locations. Its fast and efficient like a scalpel.  It is not suited for larger jobs imagine mowing a lawn with a scalpel.C is a number of significant improvements bolted onto C. It retains the same essential syntax but adds a number of significant improvements especially the ability to do objectoriented programming. It compiles directly to very efficient code but it can be difficult to work with for a beginner because there are some inconsistencies that can be confusing.C and similarly Java is much higherlevel. If C is a scalpel and C is a swiss army knife C is an entire toolbox with blowtorches electric drills and power tools already supplied.  Its a bit slower than C but the ease in coding is often worth it.C is very similar in philosophy to Java but C is still primarily a Windows based language thankfully this is changing and Java is available on every major platform.On top of this you have the very highlevel scripting languages like Python Lua and Ruby.  They take extraction to an art form.  While such languages have performance issues they normally are used in conjunction with a lowerlevel language so the raytracing might be done in C or C but the NPC interactions can be done in a much easier language like Python or Lua.  A lot of game development is being done this way now with a combination approach.. People worry WAY TOO MUCH about which language to study.  The important thing is to learn how programming works.  Make variables understand types and scopes build and break some loops write functions pass parameters build some objects.Really its more important that you have success than learn the details of any particular language.  Sometimes people will try to start with C because thats what pros use.  Well professional racecar drivers drive Fs but maybe you should start with something a little more forgiving.  If you want to actually motivate yourself by building games go with a language that doesnt get in your way first.  Performance is not critical yet.  I really like Python with PyGame or the numerous HTML  JS tools out there today.  If you want to mess with D Blender is a lot of fun and its free and you can do quite a bit before you have to do any coding.  Then when you are ready to write some scripts theres a built in Python interpreter already there.edit  formatting,learnprogramming,csl465h,2,t5_2r7yd

Part of being a skilled developer is knowing how and where to find the answers to things you dont rememberhavent learned quite yet. Developing your research and problem solving skills is more important than your memorization of a standard library.Java is a vast and verbose language its going to take time. I personally agree that Java can feel very bloated but familiarity is possible just takes time. I echo the previous poster in suggesting you keep to simple projects and progressively build complexity. Avoid copypasting to solve problems without truly understanding how or why the code works. If you cant verbally explain to yourself how a program youve built works you dont really understand it.Do you have a clear understanding of OOP principles or is this your first foray into programming in general? If youre not clear on APIE Abstraction Polymorphism Inheritance Encapsulation and the code mechanisms that enable those concepts I would suggest focusing on simple projects that help you fully understand this sort of methodology. A lot of Java programs you may be looking at probably employ comprehensive design patterns that leverage these simple concepts into much larger constructs of design which I imagine would be incredibly overwhelming if youre not comfortable with the basics.Read some books or follow some youtube tutorials  go back over your work after the fact and try to explain it to yourself aloud without the handholding of booksvideos. Youll know when youre ready to progress by judging how well you can verbalize the design of your program this involves being honest with yourself. Take what youve learned and try to build something slightly differentoriginal. Keep scaling up the challenge or turning the pages from there. Most importantly keep in mind that being a programmer involves working primarily on things that do not work yet. The challenge the problem solving the struggle is what programmers do by trade. You will likely never feel fulfilled if you cant accept that its a neverending process of continual evolution. The incredibly high rate of imposter syndrome in the industry is because the knowledge base is so incredibly vast  there is always a ton you dont know and a ton youll never know because you have a finite life. Just gotta get zen with that fact or better yet get excited by it.TLDR Just keep going dont demoralize yourself by overreaching dont cheat yourself by copypasting without understanding.,learnprogramming,csne73j,2,t5_2r7yd

If youre just learning to program you may find also having to basically relearn how you typeedit text at the same time may be too frustrating. Vim is also very configurable and if youre distracted easily may find yourself focusing more on tweaking Vim rather then actually coding which is bad.gt since it does that thing where programming lines change color based on the kind of line it is or whatever.This is called syntax highlighting. Vim can also do this though you typically have to manually enable it type syntax on in normal mode while editing a file or add syntax on to your .vimrc file.gt I want to get in the habit of using VIM but some people have told me its dumb. Ive searched this subreddit for VIM and learning it and it seemed like a good idea to based on the results ive gotten.I would recommend learning Python first then practice programming then try learning Vim to spread out the learning curve  make sure you have your priorities straight. That said if you understand that learning how to use Vim is of far lower priority then learning to code and dont mind potentially being frustratedknow how to deal with frustration then learning Vim at the same time may be right for you.Basically odds are itll slow you down at first but could potentially be powerful down the line or maybe not  depends on how much time you chose to invest in it.gt Can anyone give any advice? Will I be losing out by missing features such as that color differentiation thing which to me is the biggest visual difference between VIM and a more modern mousebased editor?Vim has almost every feature you could want or at least will have something similar but you will typically have to install or configure those things yourself. Again this should be low priority right now and you should avoid falling into the trap of being more obsessed with your tools then what you decide to make with them.In particular you mentioned potentially restarting Learn Python the Hard Way in another post. Again this is what I mean by making sure you have your priorities straight.

In Russia the minister was caught in a corruption scandal about hundreds of millions of dollars  and he was quietly amnestied and never even went to trial. Why?

Theres a guy on the development team that Im on who was a trucker until the age of  or so  then started getting into computers  hes now well past  and is one of the best developers Ive had the pleasure of working with. The great thing about a programming job is most people dont even look at college degrees they just want to know you have an aptitude for continuing to learn and proficiency in programming.  Most young programmers it seems these days are focused more on mobile and web development  and honestly  thats not where the moneys at if youre looking for a fat paying job. If you can handle the environment the best paying development jobs are those writing proprietary software for enterpriselevel businesses on expensive technology like OracleBizTalkCloverleafetc. I would highly suggest that if youre looking to pursue a serious career in software programming that you start off by learning CNot C just straight C and skip the web development portion at least in the beginning.  If you take up web development as your first go at software development youll very quickly get tied down by a bunch of horribly written tutorials out there what of the gazillion technologies you should be using etc. Instead learn and become proficient with C.  C is the basis for most programming languages out there it will give you a great understanding of how data actually moves at the lowerlevels of a computer and will force you to learn how to write software correctly as a whole. Bonus Itd also be good to learn the basic theorypractices in a more formal setting of Computer Science.

You surely just square it and oh wait... To raise an arbitrary number other than  to an arbitrary power you need to use the number e first. e is the number where the integral of x from  to x equals  for xe. If you say that this integral of x is the function ylnx then the inverse function is xexpy. Thus expe. An important property of exp is that exp xr  exprx. Thus exprer. This means that if you want to find a number ax it is the same as ex lna.So to find . you need e.ln. ln can be found by integrating x from  to . This is .. This may be done using ln if you dont approximate it thus becoming a recursive proof so dont do thatThis means we need to solve e..e..One way to solve that is using Taylor polynomials. The Maclaurin series for ex is the sum from n to infinity of xn n! Maclaurin is what we call Taylor polynomials around the point c for fc So if we choose n up to  we get that sqrt..Or as fraction If I google sqrt I am told that it is .. Using higher n in the polynomial increases our results accuracy. With higher n and without rounding ln you should obtain a very accurate answer.I hope that illustrates why . is not as simple as you thought ,learnprogramming,ct6nxi6,1,t5_2r7yd

4616713,0,t1_ctchh3i,This is my best go at explaining the syntax I dont know Haskell very well    defaultnumber      formurl  Pretty self explanatory. Declares two constants called defaultnumber and formurl with the assigned values.    buildMessage  String gt Maybe String gt StringThis is a type signature. It says that buildMessage is a function that takes a string and optionally another string and returns a string.    buildMessage msg Just phonenumber  CODE  show . take  phonenumber  ampNUM  show . drop  phonenumber  ampMESSAGE  urlEncode msgThis appears to be the meat of the function. It says that if buildMessage is passed two strings then evaluate the expression on the right.  is the string concatenation operator in Haskell. take is a function that takes a number and a list and returns a new list consisting of only the first n elements where n is the function passed in. The . is the function composition operator and show converts a value to a string so together show . take  phonenumber takes the first  characters of the phone number and returns a string.drop is similar to take but it returns everything but the first n elements of the input list. So show . drop  phonenumber returns a string consisting of everything after the first  characters of phonenumber.So put together this says that if the buildMessage function were passed say msgHello world and phonenumber it would return CODEampNUMampMESSAGEHelloWorld     buildMessage msg Nothing  buildMessage msg  Just defaultnumber  work without a number tooThis line basically says that if buildMessage is not passed a phone number then use the default number defined above.    runString msg number  curl d   show  buildMessage msg number     show formurlThis defines another function called runString. No type signature is provided but we can infer that this function takes a message and a number and builds a curl command through string concatenation which is probably not a good idea. formurl is constant and defined above so this command would be expected to produce output like     curl d CODEampNUMampMESSAGEHelloWorld Theres one more function in this file    sendText  String gt Maybe String gt IO     sendText message number  do    putStrLn  Running   runString message number    code lt system  runString message number    putStrLn  Finished with exit code   show code   This defines a function called sendText that takes a string and optionally another string and returns an IO monad. I dont really understand monads. However it looks like this function calls runString to build a curl command prints the command that it is about to execute to standard out and then executes the command using system. Finally it prints the exit code of the curl process presumably so you can see if it failed.This code as far as I can tell does not have any protection against script injection. If you are going to be using this with untrusted input make sure to add a function to verify that phonenumber is actually a number and not a bash command.,learnprogramming,ctcik31,1,t5_2r7yd

If you wanted to use C to make a webapp youd have to use a tool like Emscripten to convert your C code into JavaScript and it would not necessarily be an easy or natural thing to do.Why JavaScript? Historical reasons. Why dont web browsers support more programming languages? Well different web browser vendors have tried but you get the chickenandegg problem. Lets say Google decides to implement a new programming language called say Flechette and decides to create a version of Google Chrome that can directly run Flechette. Well you run into a problem  nobody is going to use Flechette because your Flechette code will not run on any other web browser. So to solve this problem Google basically has to make a FlechettetoJavaScript compiler to make the code you write portable.

A bit can have  states true or false on or off. So for your x pixel display youd need  bits for each pixel so  bits   bytes.If you have   states you will need  bits. Or half a byte.

Typically these ids should be incremental and utilize the DBMS autoincrementation eg Postgres has the SERIAL data type for this.. Insert the coordinates using that id.. Insert the visits using that id.Repeat for every record. Ive never used the Oracle DB but Im under the impression that PG and Oracle have a fair bit in common. Youll want to do this in a transaction so that if something goes wrong in one of those steps the whole transaction will fail and you wont get partial records.For interacting with a database from C something I havent done yet you probably want to start here ,learnprogramming,ctkhz98,2,t5_2r7yd

This condition defines the concept of coherent view of memory. If processors can read the same old value after the write made by P we can say that the memory is incoherent.Ah so theres a mechanism to ensure that read write events are in sequences and never at the same time?Essentially Im trying to understand what happens when writeread events are not sufficiently separated.,learnprogramming,ctmqvf3,1,t5_2r7yd

4797016,0,t1_ctyxbnv,Well a CS degree cant teach you everything. It teaches the fundamentals and the advancedtheoretical parts that can be very difficult to find good resources on. Theres an expectation that you can use what you learned to learn totally new things.For example I know web dev and how to mine data even though my university has not taught it. Web dev needs to come first. You will crash and burn if you try and mine data from a website without an understanding of how websites work. To make this conclusion short of some lucky google searches youd have to utilize some deductive reasoning. You know that the data is stored in a web application but you dont know how web applications work. The logical first step is to figure that out which would lead you to figuring out HTML.Eventually youd find the need to learn about ajax and web APIs because youd find that some websites do not have the data you need in the HTML file. You download the HTML and its just not there. If your understanding of web applications was comprehensive enough youd know that the only way that the site could possibly be changing is if JS is being used to do so since theres no real alternative and this would lead to discovering ajax.Once you learn web dev the general idea of data mining will be obvious. Eg youd know that if you wanted to get data from an HTML file youd need to parse it. So you might google parse HTML and conclude your first thought of using regex was hairbrained and go with a library like Beautiful Soup.Really though surely you must understand that your university cannot teach you everything and that theres large swaths you must learn yourself hopefully utilizing some of the knowledge that your university does teach you.

4891013,0,t3_3hvzn0,There are situations where you cant use a member function.  One example is where you are overloading a binary operator for an operand type that isnt under your control.  Suppose you wrote MyClass and want it to work with IO streams so that you can write things like stdcout ltlt instanceofmyclass.  You cant add a new member of stdostream so it has to be a nonmember function that takes stdostream amp and const MyClass amp.  Ideally that function can do everything it needs to do with the public interface but if it cant then it can be a friend.Even if you control the class there are still very good reasons to use a member function such as allowing implicit conversions of the lefthand operand.  In fact most binary operators should be nonmember functions for this reason with some exceptions e.g. assignment operators like  need to be member functions.,learnprogramming,cub1uq0,3,t5_2r7yd

Note that we cannot use a regular loop here because. We want a certain amount of delay between each redraw so that theres a reasonably consistent smooth animation. A loop will just run as fast as it can.. JS is single threaded so using a loop would prevent the JS from giving the browser any time to draw.

You could technically have a Card class to store the different ways to value a card the suit etc. if you wanted and the Deck class would work with a list of them but you might not depending on what your requirements are. Deck only deals with the organization of the cards so if you want to add more and more properties of the card at some point you might want to split it into its own class. At that point its up to personal taste. You might not need a separate class per brand but you might want to subclass if you want a brand that has a bunch of extra jokers and informational cards. This is assuming that the deck creates its own card list. You might create a Deck class that takes a list of cards when its created. Then there would be no need to. Brand could just be a property. You could also subclass and have a Deck that does a fake shuffle. You might or might not have a dealer depending on how you want to structure things. It might be too much work and the base program could just keep track of everything the dealer would like money and giving cards to player. But yes it would all be outside of the card class. A person would probably just hold cards and money. Where you put your functions that determine what kind of hand a player has isnt immediately obvious to me.,learnprogramming,cuphih1,2,t5_2r7yd

This goes into a certain directory which your hosts webserver is preconfigured to serve from. This is usually called  or something similar. Users then type in your domain name and this is translated by your DNS entry which should also be editable in your control panel.User then gets the numeric IP of your host and their browser is sent to your website. Now their request will start with the DEFAULT DOCUMENT like index.html Often you want to use INDEX.PHP instead and thid you may need to configure in your CP.Now the User has the full address of your home page and requests it. This is where YOUR code runs and produces a html page.You can have as many pages as you like with media etc. all of which must be uploaded along with your site. First make a simple Hello World and ensure that works then you know everything is in place and configured correctly. Later you may want to use database which will also be available from your CP.

I was very hesitant to join a bootcamp mainly because I barely have any money saved up and Im still well in debt from college which I graduated from  years ago. Ive heard the success stories as well as the failures and ultimately it came down to if I believe I can push myself to learn what is necessary to be employable within a year you get out what you put in.

For example    gt var foo      undefined    gt foo.bar          gt foo.baz  blah    blah    gt JSON.stringifyfoo    barbazblahThe resulting string is what youd have to write in a JS file to recreate that object.  This is a format known as JSON which has become a crossplatform standard.The opposite of JSON.stringify is JSON.parse which takes a string and parses it as JSON returning the resulting object.  These two form a matched pair.  The JSON object by itself is useless its only there are a form of namespacing for those two functions.Recursion enters the picture when you have nested objects.  Picking up from where the above example left off if you wrote    gt foo.quux  abc  xyz      abc  xyz      gt JSON.stringifyfoo    barbazblahquuxabcxyzThe resulting string contains the entire object including any nested objects.

5183895,0,t3_3lzcne,Stop using codeacademy right now. It made me give up on programming for quite some time because it made me think that programming was insanely hard it normally isnt but their lessons suck.I recommend what the wiki recommends  .Now onto your question what you are doing is actually pretty complicated for a beginner thing. You are making a function in line  youre declaring it with the label greeting and are giving it an argument more on that later. From now on whenever you use the word greeting it will refer to that function as long as you are in the same code. then on line  you are logging it this outputs the text in the parenthesis to the console. The console is not what you see on a webpage if you click f and then go to console tab right now you will see whatever reddit is logging normally this is used for things like debugging. Finally on line  you end the function by closing the curly brackets.Now when you call greetingPanicProne The code does whatever is in between the curly brackets assuming that the variable name is equal to PanicProne. On line  inside of the parenthesis of the log you are adding these strings together. Great to see you is the first string you then add like math but with strings a space   to make the response look neater and finally you add whatever name is equal to. Since you called greetingPanicProne the code believes that name the argument given to the function when you first made it is equal to PanicProne.You are not dumb but the way they teach at CodeAcademy made me feel this way and it is making you feel so as well.,learnprogramming,cvaul31,2,t5_2r7yd

5202867,0,t3_3m80e3,Most games are developed and optimized with a Polygon Budget in mind of how many polygonsAPI draw callsshader operations can be used while maintaining an acceptable framerate. Even the most powerful hardware still has some finite amount of computing power and you have to spend your polygons wisely if you want to maximize your graphical fidelity while maintaining a good framerate. Floating arms are just one of numberless compromises between realism and performance. On the D screen most games are played on you cant tell the difference so it is a great tradeoff.There are three big reasons to use floating arms Better performanceWhenever you issue a draw call to render a mesh every triangle on the mesh has to be checked for visibility on screen. So if you had one mesh for everything you would be wasting cycles checking the geometry of the legs torso and head every frame even if you were looking straight up at the sky. Keeping the mesh down to only the bits that will always be visible saves memory and saves time while rendering.For the same reason rendering arms separately from the rest of the level saves you from having to render anything concealed behind them. You render the stperson models first so in your second rendering pass you can skip over anything hidden behind them. Console FPS titles often have extremely large arm and weapon models for exactly this reason it is cheaper to render the arms and weapon than it is to render the models behind it. Higher Quality ModelsUsing the same model for st and rd person models may be simpler but separating the two lets you have models of appropriate levels of detail. The rdperson model can have a much lower polygon count because it will be viewed from further away and the extra polygons wouldnt be noticeable. The stperson arms will be examined upclose by the player for hours on end so may as well make them more detailed.  Higher quality animationIn the same vein as the model resolution is the animation quality. The stperson model will have much more detailed rigging models with bones for each finger joint and moving part on the weapon. The expense of creating and calculating the animations on stperson models is justified because it is clearly visible to the player. But the rdperson model doesnt need to have anywhere near so much detail in its animations so you keep the rigging on the rdperson model very simple and spend your time and energy on improving the stperson models and animation.,learnprogramming,cvd4zz8,2,t5_2r7yd

5210737,0,t1_cve1f3f,gt Anyways one question before I restart my code. In C you need to include the headers and all. Yesterday in the examples I dont think I remember seeing anything like that in java.I apologize if I get any of this wrong I dont use Java.C and Java have completely different systems for including things. The appearance of similarities are superficial.Java uses fully qualified class names to find classes. You can use any public class from anywhere as long as you know the fully qualified name. These names are organized into packages. As an example Java has a utility package that includes a dynamic array class similar to Cs stdvector.    Java.util.ArrayListltIntegergt myList  new Java.util.ArrayListltIntegergtUsing the fully qualified name is cumbersome so Java has the import statement.    import Java.util.ArrayList     or    import Java.util.     import the entire Java.util package including ArrayList        ArrayListltIntegergt myList  new ArrayListltIntegergtBut you can always access the ArrayList class even without an import you just need to use the fully qualified name. Contrast this situation with Cs include.ampnbspJava automatically imports a handful of packages by default. These are the Java.lang package which includes basic classes like String the unnamed package I forget what this is for and the current file or file scope package. This last is basically the directory the file is in.So when you say thisgt You dont need to tie the files together as long as theyre saved in the same folder right?understand that the fully qualified names are still being used but the compiler is basically making and handful of automatic package and import statements.You can specify your own package names to organize your projects in a sane way and of course if you want to access classes from outside the folder.More on packages ,learnprogramming,cve34g4,0,t5_2r7yd

ClassMethodVariable naming bucky which he uses in nearly every video is nowhere a proper variable name proper coding procedures  he has absolutely no planning just codes as he tags along. Beginners should learn a bit about planning. adhering to coding standards Java has very strict code conventions  he doesnt adhere to them. commonly used terminology  he explains the syntax but in his very own way and often does not use common terminology and also he does not really explain why he is doing something  which to me is more important than syntax.  commonly used algorithms  certain commonly used algorithms like iterating through a String basic sorting etc. should be part of even beginner tutorials. I couldnt really find anything in that line.My opinion is that a beginner should learn the proper way in order to avoid forming of bad habits that are difficult to get rid of. The better the tutorials are the better the outcome for the beginner.Sure theNewBoston has a nice relaxed teaching style which makes it easy and fun to watch his videos but others also have this and their content is up to standards.,learnprogramming,cvrh93z,6,t5_2r7yd

That line looks like this    out    x generations This is not how you initialize an array.  The initializer list must use curly braces not square brackets.  And secondly the initializer list must be part of the initialization of the array.  You cant declare an array and then assign an initializer list to it later.  So this line should be    int out  x generationsAnd line  should go away.The other error is because you are trying to return out which is an array from a function that is declared to return an int.

5380519,0,t3_3onhsn,gt Of all the authors that have posted a comment in this subreddit how many of those authors have posted in other subreddits subreddtis that have at least  distinct authors that have made a comment compared to the total distinct authors from that subreddit.This approach to similarity is called Jaccard Similarity Obviously youve had pretty good results but it doesnt control for the relative amount of activity of a given user. An alternative method for calculating similarity that Id recommend you experiment with is called Cosine Similarity Heres how you would do this. For a given subbreddit count the number of comments each author has commented in that subreddit. This will give you a vector of counts v. NB not just learnprogramming authors but all of them. This will be important for the normalization we perform in the next step.. Normalize v to have unit magnitude by dividing through by the current magnitude |v| to get v|v|. To calculate |v| square each users counts sum them all together and then take the square root. Details. To calculate the similarity between two subreddits take the dot product of their respective normalized count vectors i.e. multiply the components together where an author has commented in both subreddits and sum the result cosv v  v|v|  v|v| The cosine similarity gives you similarity as the angle between the two count vectors without regard to the magnitude of the vectors. The idea is that you are treating the observed amount of relative activity of each user as sort of an activity profile for the subreddit and trying to find other subreddits with similar activity profiles in user space.This wont necessarily give you better results but it might. You could try constraining your attention to just learnprogramming authors but for this approach the disjunction of people who participate in subreddits is very informative.EDIT Actually Im on the fence about this last bit. Maybe it would be better to constrain attention to just the redditors in learnprogramming.,learnprogramming,cvzf75x,1,t5_2r7yd

Even experienced programmers like me as I am over  years in the business often spend hours thinking about how to solve a particular problem. My domain industrial automation programming even sometimes requires that I spend days and weeks thinking and planning. In industrial automation it is common to plan about twice as long as to actually program.If you dont immediately get the solution dont panic. Step away from the problem take a walk do something different. Often a bit of distance helps solving the problem.Or do some Rubber duck debugging Find an inanimate object and explain the problem to it. This is nothing funny nor something crazy. RDD is an approved method of problem solving in programming. By explaining your problem you have to think differently about the problem and often it helps finding a solution.TLDR Your problem is perfectly normal for a beginner as you dont have the practical experience that others have.

In small scale development the difference in working hours adds a lot of lost time in large scale development management and coordination of effort are your two largest problems so outsourcing ends up creating more problems than it solves.  If you thought bureaucratic red tape is bad wait until you add another level or two of management to manage outsourcing.

5463102,0,t3_3pw9yg,Alright so lets take your idea and see what happens. If we just use the variable name input throughout the program    private String input            public ReverserString input    input  input        See the problem? You have  inputs one outside the function and one inside the function. Perhaps the value of the outer input is foo and the value of the inner input i.e. the method parameter is bar. But theyre both called input so now input  input has  possible meanings Assign the outside input into the inside input e.g. inner input now changed to to foo Assign the inside input into the outside input e.g. outer input now changed to bar Assign the outside input back into itself. No effect. Assign the inside input back into itself. No effect.So the statement input  input is ambiguous and the compiler is not just going to arbitrarily pick one of those. To solve this use the this keyword    private String input        public ReverserString input        this.input  input     So now youre not being ambiguous. It is saying take the method argument variable input and assign it into the current objects input variable. This is used pretty often. However this code can look confusing especially for beginners because it just looks like you have  variable when you really have . So some people prefer just naming them differently like in your original case    private String input        public ReverserString in       input  in     In a style like this theres clearly  different variables. Downside is you have to create more variable names. If you dont like that use the this keyword to like I shown above.,learnprogramming,cw9ynzr,2,t5_2r7yd

5484128,0,t3_3q5g71,Be very absolute about what a function accepts in terms of its arguments and returns. Be very precise about what a particular module in your program is for. Dont let a specific function class or module do something that is outside of its primary purpose.There are always exceptions but this is a good guideline. Its very easy to start making a mess of things if youre lax with this. Design mistakes are cumulative since one mistake usually requires a hack or concession somewhere else and things snowball from there.PS I dont mind copypasting. I do it myself as well.

Also javascript code tends to include anonymous functions and closures and stuff like that liberally.  These are tough to get for a beginner.  Alot of javascript code out there relies on rd party libraries like jQuery and then you get the really weird stuff like function ..If programming is really your thing and you love it Id suggest you also learn another language.Otherwise My advice would just be to keep googling what you need to do.

Overriding is for inheritance. If it helps the reason to use properties in C is exactly the same as the reason to use getters and setters in Java. C just provides a lot of convenient syntax sugar so that you write less code. It still works basically the same way and is done for the same reasons.gtBut a vanilla gettersetter? Numerous reasons for using getters and setters are listed here The first  points apply to vanilla getters and setters.gtSo what youre saying is that without a property I would later be unable to change the value of a field once initialized?You wont be able to override it and cannot convert a field to use a calculation instead of being directly set yes. Eg suppose that a class stores some data in a variable. But later in the future you discover that you can extract the data from some other variable or otherwise dynamically get the value. Youd need a method to do that. So a field wont work but a getter will.,learnprogramming,cwiqqqz,1,t5_2r7yd

Learning slow is fine as long as you eventually get it and even better enjoy learning. People Ive known who washed out of programming just never got it and didnt even want to get it. They didnt enjoy programming solving problems.Lot of what programming is is just sitting there thinking about a problem for hours on end and figuring out a solution. Some people figure out solutions faster than others but as long as you keep at it and figure it out thats what matters.Personally Im on the slower side myself. However I like solving problems and I can sit there looking at a problem for hours. Sure I may get stressed but I take breaks when I need to and then start right back up. I ultimately enjoy programming and thats what keeps me going.The stress thing I would check out medically and if you can resolve that then I think youll be fine.,learnprogramming,cwtjx22,2,t5_2r7yd

The input function is for getting input from the command line.  name  input  tells the program hey you should grab something that will be entered in the command line and assign it to name.  name  input prompt  tells the program to print prompt on the command line and whatever the user enters will be after prompt and then whatever the user enters is assigned to name.

Ive tried so many...and its not because Im full of self loathing and hate its because Ive finally come to accept that these experts suck at teaching.I started learning python about two years ago. First I went to Zed Shaws Learn Python The Hard Way and the very first thing he told me to do was stop and go learn the command line instead. So I did that then went back to his Python book. Ive done three or four different courseraedx intro to programming classes. Two or three of them I took multiple times. I read Python for Informatics by Charles Severance four times. I watched his Youtube lectures which mirror the book three times. I did the Codecademy python course twice.They are all breathtakingly awful. If I could go back in time and teach my former self oneonone I could learn everything I know now in about a month. Thats a fucking disgrace. Not only can I not find a resource that does an effective job I cant even find a learning format that works. Open courseware books interactive websites nor lecture playlists are working. At this point I dont know what I dont know and what I need to be learning.The only learning resource that I have been able to effectively use is Khan Academys math section. Its fully fleshed out tests you to find out what you know and is linear so you can start at the very beginning and know that you are precisely prepared for what you are about to learn. Their CS section is in alpha. I did their SQL section and the entire time I was agitated and muttering to myself If I didnt already know all this then nothing here would make any sense at all!

If you intend them to be or fields you can try    INSERT INTO productsalecount name mostsold leastsold    SELECT ProductID  as mostsold  as leastsold    FROM product    ORDER BY NumberOfSales DESC LIMIT     UNION    SELECT ProductID  as mostsold  as leastsold    FROM product    ORDER BY NumberOfSales ASC LIMIT And then you can find the most or leastsold products by using    SELECT ProductID FROM productsalecount WHERE mostsold    SELECT ProductID FROM productsalecount WHERE leastsoldIf you want to keep the NumberOfSales in the productsalecount table you can certainly do that.  Just add a column for it and add it to your INSERT...SELECT query.  Another alternative is to use a JOIN when you fetch from productsalecount so that you have the most uptodate NumberOfSales.    SELECT productsalecount.ProductID           product.NumberOfSales    FROM productsalecount    WHERE productsalecount.mostsold    ORDER BY product.NumberOfSales DESCThen you dont have to worry about NumberOfSales during your INSERT...SELECT.  But that depends whether youre more interested in having the latest NumberOfSales or the NumberOfSales that was present at the time the product was chosen for the mostsold list.You may wish to have two separate tables for productsmostsold and productsleastsold.  This may be more or less natural than putting them into one table and using Boolean columns depending on your situation.  For example if you always plan to query mostsold and lostsold together you might find it easier to have them in one table fetch them all and have your application decide which is which.You could just ALTER productsalecount to add the TINYINT fields mostsold and leastsold possibly define INDEXes on them and use an UPDATE instead of INSERT...SELECT.

Im sure you feel scared about learning a computer language a little ashamed even... but dont. It happens to all of us and honestly learning a computer language is a lot like learning a people language. It can be difficult for some easier for others and many feel unmotivated to do it despite its vast benefits in social and economic circles.Also like people languages theres a lot of confusion surrounding them. Some languages dont translate well over to another the same goes for coding.You want to a language to help you find a job so your best bet is probably JavaScript C or HTML. Honestly anyone can learn HTML HTML is really old and I used to use it for the ancient relics of online activity. Thats why I need to learn a new language because who the fuck speaks HTML anymore? Its become like Latin. But a lot of businesses still use XPs and Vistas because theyre cheap or they ship jobs to India and they cant afford the newer stuff. So HTML is still a relevant language if you dont live in the firstworld.JavaScript is really the official language of your phone. Most every app or program on Androids and Iphones uses JavaScript. If you were to work at customer service for TMobile knowing JavaScript could look good on your resume as youd be able to help customers with their phone problems on a different level.C is the language of script kiddies and independent game developers. Not really professional job skill language but its a pretty diverse language and with it you could impress some unwitting employers or desperately try to string together a shitty game for a Steam sale. Call it Fun Simulator where without constant updates and moderators serverkicking and banning you... the game is almost fun!

6035866,0,t3_3y5w0q,gt Does Visual Studio compile my C code just by me running it? Im reading the C primer and it mentions having to use certain prompts some of which is familiar to me from working with C on Unix in the command window.If it helps imagine that the run button is essentially running those console prompts for you in the background then will proceed to automatically run your binary. The commands it uses are similar to the ones your C tutorials are telling you aboutThis is really a twostep process but for the sake of convenience the run button does both steps at once for you. I should also mention that Visual Studio will also do the same thing with C code  like C C can be compiled and executed via the command line and the run button just hides that from you.Visual Studios in both cases will come bundled with a compiler you can run on the command line to directly compile your C or C code wo having to open the IDE.gt Do I have to worry about this? Is just pressing the run button in Visual Studio all I have to do? Its good to be aware that it is possible to compile C programs on the command line in case you ever need to write C code on Linuxdont have Visual Studios on a Windows machine but its not likely something that youre going to need for the short term  the run button is fine.Just remember that Visual Studios isnt the only way to compile C code on Windows  you could download GCC typically via something like Mingw which bundles GCC with some useful libraries or Clang write your code in a text editor like Notepad or Sublime Text and compile  run everything in a command line.You should never really require an IDE to write any code  its a convenience but not necessary. The main exception might be certain proprietary programming languages that do require you to do everything via their IDE.gt Also is it fine that Im using Visual Studio for C since I see a lot of people using other IDEs?Visual Studios should be fine for the time being while you get the hang of C.,learnprogramming,cyate82,2,t5_2r7yd

6040094,0,t3_3y8ato,It depends on what youre trying to accomplish. For a simple textbased RPG any programming language should be able to get the job done. But lets break down the problem so we can find a real answer rather than use any language you want.Lets look at what youre wanting to accomplish. A textbased game. Running in the terminal.Lets start with . Any programming language can output text to the screen. Are you exclusively wanting to output to the terminal? If so Python C  C Java or scheme the languages you listed would all work. Alternatives like JS would also work if youre wanting to build a web game I digress as you didnt list JS as a language you wanted to use but Ill include it as an example anyway.So now weve decided to pick Python C C Java or scheme. Which one of these are you the most familiar with or which one do you want to develop further skills with? This is your next big question.If you are comfortable with using Classes and Inheritance and want to test your OOP skills use a language like C Java or Python. In your textbased RPG you could practice inheritance by creating a class called weapon and have child classes called sword crossbow or axe that inherit from weapon. You could do the same with a class called character and have properties like health attackPower defenseLevel and so forth. Classes player and enemy could inherit from character. Theres a lot of potential to really practice OOP principles with a design like this.For a small project like this use whatever paradigm you are comfortable with or want to learn more about to get the job done. I like to draw or model out the design of the program Im making. This will help you understand the technical requirements for your project.TLDR Use what works.,learnprogramming,cybd8gv,3,t5_2r7yd

I dont think memorizing bits of code is really helpful but memorizing certain bits of information you learned about the technologies frameworks and etc is important. I think people end up forgetting everything they learned as soon as the implementation is done or when they stop needing the new information they learned. It might be in their short term memory for a little bit but it will be gone in a few months. Try Anki.   Its basically a daily flash card exercise where you create your own flash cards.

6216346,0,t3_40q6z6,While you could set up a build system locally often your compiler is all you need on your machine. Build systems usually live on other servers.A build system is heavily used in situations where you have continous integration. Let me try to ELI how build systems work at least for our team.Lets say you write some code locally and compile it test it and it all works. You commit it and push it to github or whatever source control system you have.A build system will notice the checkin and immediately fetch your code from github compiler your code and run any unit tests and integration tests on the build. If it all passes the build system will create a package a zip file or tarball with your application output and push it to a server somewhere. In the case of a webapplication it might even deploy it to a staging environment. After all verification is done those changes can be further propagated to production or an installer is created and shipped.Basically a build system automates all the parts needed to compile test and package your app.Continous integration is the process I mentioned earlier where code is checked out tested and built with every commit to the source control repo. Its a powerful tool especially for larger teams.,learnprogramming,cyw8cs4,2,t5_2r7yd

6250201,0,t3_416pn0,IMO from what Ive seen on Reddit and other Cool areas of discussion javascript is very much in vogue. I think all languages get a lot of hate depending on who you talk to. But heres a difference that makes me frustrated sometimes.Ive only been programming for a year but I started on Java. I would consider Java a Safe language. You have to declare your variable types and method parametersreturns its a statically typed language which means if you mess something up it will yell at you pretty quickly to fix it. Its hard to shoot yourself in the foot.For example in Java       String name  kevinmarenger    private String capitalizeString word         return word.toUpperCase    I have to declare my name variable a string I have to tell the function that I am inputting a string I have to tell it I am returning a string and I have to declare the scope of my function private. Also note the semicolons.Javascript variablesparametersreturn types can pretty much be whatever you want. The language is dynamically typed which means it wont yell at you unless it runs into a problem with your code while its running. Heres the same function in javascript    var name  kevinmarenger    function capitalizeword         return word.toUpperCase    But name could be  or a boolean or anything  its not going to tell you if it might cause a problem. And semicolons are optional which is apparently a whole thing in the programming community but Ive avoided that can of worms. I use them I wanted to develop a web application which meant learning Javascript. I really only knew SQL and Java. So I dive in without realllly knowing what I was doing. Im off writing my functions and Im getting this horrible bug where my array is randomly changing values mid iteration. I CANNOT figure it out. Hours spent on this  line program.So eventually I saw it. In programming  means to set equal  means to compare equality. So in Java if I wrote    ifcount     do stuff The program wouldnt even run my IDE would be screaming at me to change it. However if you write the same code in javascript it will accept it. And it WILL change the god damn count to . It WILL ruin your fucking day. Now eventually as I became and am becoming more experienced in Javascript I am much better about managing stuff like this and it has made me a better programmer. But sometimes it can be frustrating to work with. Even though I have to write more code in Java compared to the same thing in Javascript I feel much more productive using Java because of the statically typed language that prevents serious confusing bugs. I guess some people would probably just blame me for being a shitty programmer and maybe thats true. But I find the safety net behind Java very reassuring.,learnprogramming,cz02wox,1,t5_2r7yd

Some of its as expected and some of it is just completely arbitrary.I assume that youve probably seen samples of code that is consistently indented and can figure out how your indentation should be done from there. ie the problem is that you simply didnt understand the importance of good formatting. Because its super duper important. It makes bugs like yours way easier to spot.In case you somehow havent seen well formatted code or your teacher is shit for examples see this article Note that KampR and its variants and Allman style are pretty much the only ones in widespread use. Both are widely used with Java although Allman style is the most popular in my experience.I really cannot stress how important this is.

How do you do that? Determine if reload is needed. where in the registry does it say a computer needs a reboot? What values do you need to check for. Execute a reboot remote. How do you do that? look into powershell remoting. Wait  seconds. HOw do you wait?Honestly for a week in a more reasonable challenge is read a value from a file. Hit google to search for that value display results in the console. Just my  cents Edit not sure why Im being downvoted Im not trying to discourage anyone from learning or even pushing themselves. But I am trying to be realistic in expectations Ive worked with a lot of newbies to coding taught mentored and tutored. Are there people that can do this a week after learning to program? Sure but they are rarity. The average person would need a little more time and exposure before attempting this.

To use it you have to include a link to it like you would any other javascript file you can serve that file or files Im not sure yourself from your webserver or link to a CDN content delivery network like so    ltscript srcUsing a CDN reduces traffic to your own server if thats an issue for you and can decrease loading times as a good CDN has lots of caches all over the world that can serve it faster than you.The JS runs as soon as its loaded. ,learnprogramming,czkif25,1,t5_2r7yd

Maybe use SQLLite or maybe just write it out toread it in from flat files.

6508892,0,t3_44p7o3,Lots of decent advice here but Im not seeing one big thing that helped me. Which is to take one idea a simple one and run with it. Plumb its depth use it in tons of ways see how others used it and think outside the box. There are an infinite way of combining things. Coding is like language. You can be a flourishing Shakespeare or witty Douglas Adams or super minimalistic with a haiku. But a core concept can be transmitted through each of these mediums. When people say practice what they mean is this type of practice. Not the  million monkeys banging on a keyboard will eventually spit out Shakespeare type of practice. Home your skills by grabbing one idea and then seeing how it looks written as Shakespeare as Douglas Adams as a haiku. Then mash them up see what happens when you combine one core concept with another and then write those up in different forms. Different forms isnt different languages although you can do that too its trying to write the logic in different ways to achieve the same thing. But more concretely take for example the idea of a pixel. Simple. Onoff. Learn to access it. Rgb. Change its color. Pick which pixel you want. Then you learn that theres an alpha value. Play with that combined with location combined with color. Now string them create a line a shape. Create an animation. Add in a way to store them. Use a list use a dict use a database. Then manipulate it with matrixes. Learn what modules exist to manipulate. PIL. Read them. Create a soothing pulsing mood light of ever shifting and pulsating colors. Make it move and undulate to something. Maybe sound. Maybe the URL parse the stock market and feed that you your storage stack of pixels. Go out of the box create a neural net to pick out Google trends and match them to your music then shift the colors to all that youll be able to listen to music and watch every shifting colors thatll tell you about the ebb and flow of the internet in real time. But it all started with one concept and your ran with it. Now to code something more abstract than this pick a big area database fluidity network security storage solutions... And pick one core concept to do exactly the same thing as with pixels. So packet sniffing or speed of storage tools lists vs dicts etc or node concepts such as used in maps for shortest routes. Start small build play with all the parameters create your own manipulators then write in different manners and then start combining then one idea at a time to a new one.Gluck these fun projects are everywhere. you should be able to find them hiding in your daily programming life. Use those as staying points for these types of exercises. If its not fun write differently combine differently start at ever smaller core concepts. ,learnprogramming,czski1q,2,t5_2r7yd

Its good for my career advancement good for the company good for the workflow.When I started to work somewhat around summer  at my current work place the workflow was like thisFor a new project   download MagentoZendwhatever to the dev PC   unpack upload to either our staging server if the client requests it or the final production! server via SFTPFTP!   DNS vhost config etc. is prepared by someone else often sometimes we do it manuallyFrom there or for continued projects   remote editing of files via WinSCP with the occasional question Who touched the Observer.php while I was editing grml lost all my work grnf!?   if the client requested a seperate environment on our staging server after testing manual! copy from staging server to dev PC to production server. As if there couldnt go anything wrong...Now this is what I proposed shortly after encountering issues   for each project  production server  environment on the staging server to show the client our work n development environments within a VM on each dev PC   no remote editing   SSH access a requirement for hosting services   usage of git so that     master  stable the production server always pulls from master only is not touched and is only updated via git pull     local configuration like database connection data caching settings... is ignored via the .gitignore file and it is installed once manually     there is a git daemon on our staging server that is the origin remote repository for every instance of that repository but occasionally we use Gitlab GitHub and Bitbucket depending on the project     there are two main branches one being master one being dev and possibly a number of feature brances or temporary hotfix branches but this is flexible   with a workflow like this     dev pulls most current version to his VM then does his changes     dev tests locally shows to coworkersproject manager VMs accessible via network then pushes to origin bareGitlabGitHubBitbucket     dev logs into staging server pulls and possibly switching the branch to be on the correct one waits for clients response     on acceptance merges dev into master logs into production server pulls     on rejection he begins at step  in this workflow or possibly reverts his own commitWith this and the features of GitlabGitHubBitbucket we make the most possible usage of the advantages of git compared to the first workflow. And its much safer and much more streamlined. Though the switch requires effort and we are still not there yet. We sometimes do remote edits on the staging server which counters the main advantage of a distributed VCS  safe concurrent work on the same parts of a project.Ive mostly derived this from Git Flow and these critics on Git FlowYou probably want to check out rgit too.

6534854,0,t3_454l31,Im not entirely sure why your code is timing out. Part of the reason is that Im finding it difficult to follow the flow of execution. One thing that I think could improve the readability and make it easier to both write and debug is to build up a second sorted list instead of trying to reuse the nodes from the original list.That is instead of trying to take the original list and reassign the .next values so that it ends up sorted leave the original list as it is and create a new list with new nodes using new ListNodeval to create them. This will make it easier to write your sort in a way that closely follows the typical pseudocode of an insertion sort. It also means you are less likely to run into issues like ending up with loops in your list or losing nodes or skipping sorting chunks of the list.EDIT I just ran though your code manually and figured out that you do in fact have a bug where you can end up creating a loop in your list. My test input was   . That is probably why youre getting a timeout.    input       line     sortedList        currNode       line     sortedList        currNode       line  true    line     currNode    loop back to   because sortedList.next is still currNode    sortedList  same as currNode,learnprogramming,czv98fv,1,t5_2r7yd

You validate the same data over and over as dates do not change inside the loop. Better solution would be to validate the data once before the loop. The second question is how much do you care if new instance is valid. If we use the Event class do you only need to display name  startDate endDate and calculate duration endDate  startDate on demand or duration is key part of your system ? How will you handle negative duration ?Does your class looks like this         public class Event        private long id        private String name        private Date startDate        private Date endDate        private long duration             public Event eventlong id String name Date startDate Date endDate            some code here             this.duration  endDate  startDate                    and negative duration will heavily impact your system ?or like this    public class Event        private long id        private String name        private Date startDate        private Date endDate             public Event eventlong id String name Date startDate Date endDate            some code here                 public long getDuration            return endDate  startDate            and you can handle negative duration while calculating it ?Next question is how will you create new instances and handle exceptions while doing so?do you have some kind of service that manages all the events ?    public class EventService        private ListltEventgt events        private long id               public EventService eventService            this.events  new LinkedListltEventgt                     public void addEventString name Date startDate Date endDate  throws ValidationError            validateEventname startDate endDate            events.addnew Eventid name startDate endDate                    private void valiadteEventname startDate endDate throws ValidationError             ifname  null                throw new ValidationErrorname can not be null!                        ifname.length                  throw new ValidationErrorname can not be empty!                        if your code looks like this     Event event    try        event  new Event        catch ValidationError e        System.out.printValidation error !                event.doSomethingyou will get a compiler warning that event might not have been initialized and you will have to do something like this    Event event  null    try        event  new Event        catch ValidationError e        System.out.printValidation error !                ifevent ! null        event.doSomething    ,learnprogramming,czzhd36,2,t5_2r7yd

Dont pigeonhole yourself to one framework because then you get left behind. Master the language that the framework or library is built on and then it wont matter if you switch between them or not on every fucking project because different projects have different requirements and picking the RIGHT framework for that project is an important skill to learn not necessarily mastering it.

6621980,0,t3_46d0z4,gt Is this reasonable?That strongly depends on the assignments.From the other comments I have learned that you are working with lots of stepbystep tasks.The key here are the specifications. One thing that you have to learn in software development is to follow specifications no matter whether you think they are good or bad to the point. There should never be any deviation from the specs. I am so adamant about that point because I work in industrial automation and there any deviation from the given specs could result in major accidents that could cost big money cost lives result in incredible income losses for the companies or have a major impact on the environment.You should despite you knowing how to do it better stick to what you are given during the course. Its for your own better.From my personal experience as a former teacherAnother problem is that you are not the only student to be graded. So if several students decide to write their own completely different code the professor would have loads of work to grade each submission and also it would shift the grading curve. How should he grade? You are using advanced techniques with proper design and good coding while the rest of the students trundle around in single method code. Should he downgrade the rest? Unfortunately this would not be an option.Its always difficult for a teacher if they have one or a few far more experienced students in a beginner class.

6634669,0,t3_46il99,Web scraping is probably what youre looking for here.Basically theres two main parts of this process.. Scrape the data from the page. Call step  repeatedly on an interval and save the results somewhere.Step  can be challenging or easy depending on how the target site is made.Its easy to download a html page with wget and select some html content with a htmlparser like mechanize. Its helpful if the target url accepts search parameters i.e. this example from craigslistThe complicating factor is Javascript though. Parsing the HTML source as textonly wont initialize any Javascript functions which are used to populate the page with content. For Javascriptloaded data mechanize can be used as a headlessbrowser which provides an API for opening a page and automating interaction with it. I.e. methods like click and form.submit.So anyway once the aforementioned methodology is used to get some data the data can be submitted via HTTP to some storage API or written to file. There is probably software that accomplishes the above goals with a more concise DSL. Look for python web scraper on Google or something.Anyway rereading your question I have some other advice. It doesnt make much sense to put off learning Python while at the same time looking for Python libraries to use. Nearly every library is going to require basic use of the language. ,learnprogramming,d05kykm,1,t5_2r7yd

Basically you approach a true RESTful API the same way regardless of whether you were writing a node.js application or testing with Postman or writing something in python.

There may be a virtual dispatch involved at runtime but the method token is bound at compile time. If a suitable method does not exist at compile time you will receive an error.Dynamic languages are the opposite. They do their work at runtime.

6728789,0,t3_47se7v,No but it might make you a better engineer by making you consider alternative mental models vocabularies and abstractions to the same problem. You obviously already know the Document Object Model or the CSS Object Model and how to breakdown a design into code in those context. Bootstrap basically is a new set of vocabulary for you with abstraction you are unfamiliar with. It might be better or it might be worse depends on the situation but you have the opportunity to learn it right now. Being a good engineer is not about how do I do this in languagelibraryframework of your choice it is about finding the best solution that will solve the problem at hand. While Bootstrap is just an abstraction above CSS it is an abstraction that is designed to solve a certain class of problems efficiently my guess themed websites that fits into a fluid grid system. Yes it does limit the expressive power of you as an engineer but that is the same tradeoff afforded to programmers when they go from Assembly to C C to PythonJavaScript and even JavaScript to CSS in some cases. You can write a web server in Assembly or C in fact with Emscripten you can write a webpage using Assembly or C. However those languages have totally different mental models vocabularies and abstractions than the traditional webbased languages as such they are not very well suited for developing a standard web app. Do you even want to care about allocating memory when your job is typesetting coloring or positioning web elements?Every languageframeworklibrary has strengths and weaknesses. While learning them you should try to recognize those strengths and weakness. For example  Can I create this in Bootstrap vs CSS vs JS vs whatever else? Can I mix and match?  Which one provides the appropriate level of abstraction?  Which one has the best domainspecific functionalities?  Which one takes less time? Which one is more maintainable?  Which one is more portable?  Which one is better tested?  Which one is more resistant to external change?  Which one is more extendable? etcIn the end that is what being a good engineer is about not simply knowing how to use an alphabet soup of languagelibraryframework. ,learnprogramming,d0fbdct,1,t5_2r7yd

Note that thats equivalent to just throwing out all bits save for the leading bit. Thatll work but conventionally wed throw out all the bits save for the final bit.In general when you want to get from a big random number to a smaller random number the typical way is to use the modulus function remainder after division. For instance if you want a number from  to  you take the original big number mod . Of course you also add or subtract the amount of the lower bound of the range you want for instance if you want a number from  to  you take the original big number mod  and then add  to it.Of course in cases where the original number is only uniformly distributed over a power of  taking the modulus with any denominator other than a power of  wont give you quite an even distribution. For instance if you originally have a random number    and you mod by  theres a slightly higher chance of getting    than   . Most of the time this effect is small enough that it doesnt matter but its important to keep in mind for the situations where it does matter. Of course if you happen to be selecting across a power of  which you are in the case you originally described this isnt an issue.,learnprogramming,d0glz0p,1,t5_2r7yd

If you look online you might find a pdf version.General tips for the interview If you get asked a really simple question dont be cocky or overconfident. Answer it professionally like any other question. This is often a personality test to see how you react when speaking to non technical people. If you get asked an insanely hard quesiton relax. Sometimes these questions are not about the answers but about how you react to a difficult problem and under stress. Take a deep breath and make it a convesation with the interview. Talk out loud about possible solutions even if you are not sure explain what you are thinking and how you would use your resources books google etc to solve it. If you dont know something like a technical quesiton explain templates in C  just be honest and say youre not sure but will look it up. Dont try to BS. Be positive about everything its ok to have opinions but dont bad mouth technologies or coding styles even if the interviewer does. Just explain why you dont like whatever in a polite way. Being too much of a downer can impact an interview. I once interviewed a guy who hated everything. Angular? Stupiddead react? A fad stupid  Ruby on Rails? Hipster crap. He was super smart but didnt et the job because no one wanted to work with someone as negative as him. Oh when I asked him point blank so what is good code? his response code I write. This is problematic also because it tells me he wants to reinvent the wheel for everything instead of solving a business need. Be nice to everyone receptionists people you walk by in the hallway interviewers janitors doormen. Anyone you interact with. We regularly ask everyone who interacted with a candidate their thoughts and we have turned down people because they were rude. Practice solving problems on codewars or codingbat just be ready to answer technical quetions.To be clear I dont work for HP but I do work for a large tech company and Im on a hiring panel.

7101499,0,t1_d1l5dky,Adding to this java is probably the fastest widely used interpreted language. Not that raw speed is going to matter for  of projects for learners. Premature optimisation is the root of all evil. The java compilation and interpretation being convoluted doesnt really matter. Compilers and interpreters are in general complicated and for  of devs its not an issue that java is both compiled and interpreted. Even though you can fork bomb in any language its really not going to do all that much beyond cause you to reboo your computer.Im with you on compilers. Every language needs to be interpreted or compiled at some point and Windows doesnt come with much support out of the box. Python not being good for big projects really isnt an issue either. If a beginner goes past so many lines of code and is running into problems because of that its more on them and what theyve written than the language. For actually large projects OP might have a point but it doesnt matter for learners.The syntax point is also moot.

7119118,0,t3_4d1422,Short answer Yes you can safely skip architecture if you are only interested in machine learning. I focused in AI in grad school and I can tell you we never discussed computer architecture in any of the ML classes I took and I took quite a few of those.That said there are reasons why you may want to take architecture anyway. Like others have said if you end up working on the implementation of ML algorithms you will wish you had taken the course since an understanding of computer architecture is crucial in high performance computing. I actually know several data science researchers who dont have traditional CS backgrounds they came from the EE side so they need to employ programmers mostly CS grad students when they need to implement algorithms on super computers and what not.Another reason is that if you end up going to grad school Im assuming youre still an undergrad? the school you go to may require that incoming students have taken an undergrad architecture course and they may even require all grad students to take a graduate architecture course like mine did. AND even if architecture isnt required the school may still require an OS course  and OS is harder to understand when you havent taken an architecture course.Personally I think all CS majors should take at the very least an introductory undergrad architecture course.,learnprogramming,d1ncvfh,2,t5_2r7yd

7194397,0,t3_4dzlbk,I havent personally done a bootcamp but recently got a computer science bachelors in December and work as a junior dev at a mid sized local company.Im  now so I was roughly your age when I went back to school.  This isnt specifically answering your question about bootcamps but I want to try to answer what seems to be your fundamental question of how to be successful as a programmer..  Put your goals into perspective.  What makes you want to program?  What type of programming would you like to do?  What type of job environment would you enjoy working in?  Are you ablewilling to move for work and if not what is the job market like in your area?  Programming is way too frustrating without goals in mind..  Put yourself into perspective.  Learning to program is a never ending learning process.  Starting in your s be prepared to meet people much younger than you who are amazing programmers.  Dont let this deter you.  These people are on the same path youre wanting to go down they just started much earlier than you.  Focus on your own development and never stop learning.Unfortunately there is no magic path to learn how to program.  There are recommended resources for learning different skills but there is no guarantee that by going through them youll become a better coder.  I often spend time researching what resources are recommended when learning something new.  Sometimes its helpful sometimes its not.  But no matter how good the resources are they arent magic and they cant guarantee you success.As far as traditional paths to becoming a developer Id break it into three groups  CollegeUniversity bootcamps and those who are selftaught.  But heres the thing not all colleges universities or bootcamps are equal.  Before you spend any money make sure you research who you are paying.  There are fantastic bootcamps out there but there are also some that are just taking peoples money.The main difference Id say between a traditional computer science degree and a bootcamp is that they teach two different parts of programming.  A computer science degree will mostly teach you theory.  Youll learn computation and how software works more than you will learn to program but you will still do a large amount of programming.  Bootcamps often introduce a typical work environment often focusing on the current hip technologies.As fast as technologies change A  year school would do you a disservice spending time on a technology that will be obsolete by the time you graduate.  But you will learn how things work and will be able to easily pick up those new technologies.  A bootcamp will often teach you current stacks being used to produce your own small applications while skipping over major theories.  You can learn what you need to know as you go.But heres the secret to both.  Neither alone will make you successful.  You will not graduate from either and be a fantastic programmer.  You HAVE to put in extra time and learn on your own.  I didnt realize this until my junior year and its the one thing I wish I would have realized sooner.My personal advice to you is this  If you havent begun to learn how to program get your feet wet online.  There are so many free resources that can get you started.  There are so many it will be overwhelming.  Think of what kind of programming youre interested in and look at what languages and tools people are using for that.  Figure out whats available online to learn these things.  Youre not losing anything by taking a free course or reading a cheap book.If youve started a bit on your own then look into what type of schools are available to you.  Really look into reviews try to talk to people who personally went to THAT school.  Youre investing potentially a lot of money into your future.  Invest smart.Lastly soft skills go a long way in tech jobs especially entry level positions.  Outside of highly competitive companies most companies are expecting to have to train junior developers so being someone they want to work with can go really far.  Im not saying that you need to change who you are by any means but while youre preparing to become a developer you should also work on being a professional that people wouldnt dislike working with.  Positivity honesty sincerity an eagerness to learn a lack of ego and a hell lot of persistence are things that can really help make you successful.,learnprogramming,d1vxzo9,1,t5_2r7yd

There wont be a day no matter how much learning you do where you will suddenly feel happy applying your skills to real world applications until you actually do it and make something substantial. Everyone here has felt exactly the same at some point and I think most still do. The way I got over that particular hump was by being forced to make something by the course I was doing. You will just have to do the same Im afraid.

Not sure where you are but here the data protection act means that youre still obliged to take care. Youre going to need a server somewhere. Otherwise how will you sync data between devices? That server needs to be secure as well. How long are you going tui be around to administrate it? Anyway. To stop being negative. If youre insistent I would recommend for ease of use and not needing to rent and manage your own actual server using a cloud provider. Theyll provide all the tools you need to very simply have a database on the Internet you dont need to worry about software updates and so on. Ive used Google in the past. Use an existing authentication service DO NOT DO THIS PART YOURSELF. Again Ive used Google accounts for this but you could use anything. Problems with this people are liable to use their personal accounts rather than having a professional account for this. Do not ever trust what the client says. Always verify every request on the server. If the client says theyre a SysAdmin check their credentials on the server. Lastly the app itself. You can interact with the server via http requests fairly simply.

7214361,0,t1_d1y0fq2,These are good questions Ill try to address them but keep in mind that everything is my opinion and colored by my experiences. Also sorry if I get caught rambling or going off on tangents. I know its a lot to digest as a beginner but I think the best thing you could do is just get started and see where you end up. Your questions make me think that youre worried about wasting time and the thing is none of the knowledge you seem interested in pursuing is a waste of time if you intend to make this a serious part of your life. You really cant make a wrong decision to start between ObjectiveC or Swift and if you intend to become a platform master and understand every blog post and bit of code that exists in the community then you will need to know Swift ObjectiveC and C.. Meeeeeeeh. This would be more possible and probably easier than you think. Sure you wouldnt be able to dive in and fully understand all the details of how it works but one thing that beginners dont recognize is how easy it often is to read code in a programming language you dont know well as long as it falls into the programming paradigms of languages that you are already familiar with and especially when youre talking about the Cfamily of languages. Really C is like the Latin of the most commonly used programming languages. And even then thats a bad analogy because languages like Swift and ObjC are way more similar than say French and Italian. The other thing to note here is that when programmers provide code to be reused its in the form of libraries or frameworks and what you actually interact with is called an API. All of Apples docs and framework APIs are fully bilingual theres literally just a toggle button on the doc webpages between objectiveC and swift and Apple has gone to great lengths to make API written in objectiveC work seamlessly in Swift. Most developers are also aware of the reality of Swift and will make sure that their older API works. If not its not hard to do it yourself. You just need to add it to your bridging header basically and Xcode can even auto generate translated headers where the API lives. No it would probably be quick to learn. In either direction but I cant go back and encounter Swift without already knowing ObjectiveC to know for sure. Refer to what I said about the Latin thing. Might be harder to learn C but C is normally considered a hard one and thats mostly because you actually have to think about memory which makes some people sad and scared because yeah its difficult when you first encounter it. Refer to the big list on that wiki article about programming paradigms. C is a pretty purely imperative language. ObjectiveC is an imperative and objectoriented language based on C as is C. Java is an imperative and objectoriented language that has syntax very closely related to C. Swift is an imperative and objectoriented language that has a lot of neat and deep functional and other features that most developers probably rarely use to their full extent and beginners probably wouldnt pick up on unless theyre pointed out. It really is true what I said about the fundamentals and its difficult to understand unless you experience it. If you know one imperative objectoriented language and fully understand what that means for designing programs picking up another at a beginner level is really not a big undertaking and becoming better than a beginner is mostly a matter of actually then using it. Its starting out with new fundamental concepts that are tough.. Thats an interesting question and really depends on a lot of factors. No you probably wont be working very closely with people who dont even know the same languages as you at all that mostly just doesnt make much sense. You could certainly be in an environment where both ObjectiveC and Swift are used but by that point youll probably have just learned both. When talking about the iOS and OS X platform as a whole it is not uncommon to encounter codebases where Swift ObjectiveC C and to a lesser extent though sometimes greater C are blended fairly seamlessly. Hell that describes the codebases I most closely use at work. I can only answer your actual question with how it would be on my team that that is if we encountered a developer who only knew Swift then we would be unlikely to hire them but only because that means that they havent developed their knowledge base enough to cut it at my specific job and for the most part the people who still only know Swift are beginners who started there. Also our codebase is primarily ObjectiveC but that does not mean that not knowing ObjectiveC is the restriction. We hired a guy who did not know ObjectiveC and hadnt really worked on the platform much but he was a very experienced programmer in C and C who again understood the fundamentals which is the key point and he picked up the language and skills needed quickly. iOS development is in pretty high demand AFAIK and there are plenty of companies out there that are either new need new products or have recently established new products in Swift.TLDR You wont be restricted by starting with Swift. You will be if you stop there.,learnprogramming,d1y7tij,1,t5_2r7yd

So plop down main and the basic function of the program now once the entire program in there in its most basic form. Then go back and next to the generalized blocks write down what methods and variables you will need. Now go to code. Write the main with just the function calls you have on your diagram.

Moreover functions that dont change the object should take a const reference. This documents that the function doesnt mutate the object it gets a reference to but more importantly it allows you to use socalled rvalues as arguments to the function. An rvalue is a value that doesnt have a named storage location to put it simply e.g. something that you create on the fly without storing it in a variable something that is returned from a function and so on.

Sometimes not very often MI solves a problem in a neat way but if not thought properly through it can get messy really quickly.You should also think about whether inheritance is needed at all. You mention that your player class has to inherit from the texture class. Why? Public inheritance is a way to express an is a relation ship between the derived class and the base class. But is the player a texture or does it have a texture? There is no one true answer here and it all comes down to your design. But it is something you need to think about and make a decision on. Personally I would say that it makes more sense to say that a player enemy etc. has a texture and I would express that by having those classes have a texture object as a member of the class instead of deriving from the texture class.,learnprogramming,d2eo6f3,1,t5_2r7yd

MaxMSP is used in over  institutions and companies. Does that count as a visual programming paradigm that is used professionally? Do the aerospace programs you mentioned earlier not count as professional applications?gt Whether you like it or not thats probably because of the reasons I mentioned.

Websites are something everyone likes so I must assume that anyone would want to give it a shot if given the chance to learn. Its a great way to get them to start coding from there if they wish to advance they can move directly onto JS to start doing some clientside scripting to increase their skills. If they like it theyll eventually move on to say writing a backend node.js would be a great introduction for them if they know JS already! And theyd already be enhancing their JS without knowing it.From there theyd already have been figuring it out for a while and move on to the next phase in specialising in whatever they have come to like.I understand that coddling the students from the real truth is only going to hurt them more.

As to what it means?First an adjacency matrix will be something like  node   node   node  storage  O|V| or basically for each vertex there needs to be a potential edge to all points. add vertex  O|V| same as storage. To add a third vertex to the above matrix wed be at  edges.add edge  O. adding an edge is as simple as setting   remove vertex  O|V| just like adding when you remove it you need to adjust every vertex and edge list. You go from  back to .remove edge  O. just like remove all youre doing is setting   .query  O. Youre returning the value found at a particular point in the matrix. Is it True or False? Is there an edge or not? Since you dont need to check all edges or anything its an easy check.As for learning the different complexities and why bubblesort is funny?

With a regex youre describing some text and searching for things that match that description.A regex like docsd says something like Im expecting some text that starts with docs followed by a slash then an arbitrary number of digits. Then you use that regex to search and youll match for docs and docs and everything else that fits the pattern docsnumber.The usefulness of regexes comes from using this matching to manipulate or pull relevant data from whatever text youre searching.

If you pick x assembly like you were thinking of then you will be able to apply it directly to your PC but assembly is rarely used on that platform. You could pick ARM for a more embedded direction and play around with a Raspberry pi perhaps. Then you will still be able to run Unix and have most of the comfort of bigger computers.

7757157,0,t3_4lju1k,There are a couple of options if you want to make C programs. The  most often usedIMO and in no specific order are. Visual Studio  VS  is free has a great UI designer that uses XAML so its easy for people not familiar with lowlevel programming to create interfaces for it and has the best debugger and autocomplete out of any C IDE no contest. The only problem with VS is that its Windowsonly and cant compile to other platforms although the .Net standard was opensourced some time ago which means we may expect crossplatform compiling soon. There is also Xamarin built into VS which allows you to compile your programs for iOS and Android.. Qt Designer  Qt is a collection of APIs wrapped in their own IDE called Qt Designer. Its used a lot in opensource apps and has a very extensive amount of widgets with which you can build interfaces. The IDE is crossplatform and can compile for a multitude of OSes since the underlying compiler is GCC MinGW on Windows.. CodeBlocks  the most minimalist of the . While it does have some UI creation tools wxWidgets most people use this IDE to learn C as a language rather than create complex applications. It has a simple autocomplete system a simple project manager and a simple debugger for users who just want to code. Basically if you want to write something less than  lines quickly and you want it to work this is the IDE you want. The underlying compiler is GCC MinGW for Windows but you can give it another compiler and debugger if you choose so CodeBlocks  VS compiler is pretty good for simple stuff. This IDE is most often used in algorithm competitions and creating simple games through frameworks such as SDL and SFML or heck even OpenGL you know the things new programmers tend to do.There are other options such as CLion if you like JetBrains ecosystem and the classic EmacsVim  plugins  compiler if youre a hardcore Unix user.But when creating UIs the first  tools do the best job.

7761134,0,t3_4ljo3f,The data structure is an array of objects.  The game engine can be used to provide physics.  At a high level each thing is added as an object and has parameters.  In these youd keep an xyz position as well as a rollpitchyaw orientation.  The objects also have graphical properties like a d mesh and skin.  Surfaces in the game world are also objects and the game engine typically provides collision detection.  So if you have the ground which is fixed in the d space and you put a player object being pushed by gravity onto the ground the collision behavior can be defined to prevent the character from going through the ground.  This is the data structure for objects in the world and game engines usually have hooks that let you give instructions on how to render the objects for meshes skins or lighting.

Im really just looking for a way that I can prompt a user in the program to choose  options create a new policy object display the policy object toString and update the policy object. There cant be an instance of the policy object when the program starts it has to be created in program by the user. I have no idea how to do that though as all I know how to do is declare instances of the object in main in the source code by hand.

7887300,0,t1_d426yuf,We want a website where people can log in and create profiles that stores their personal information and careers. From there we want to be able to send out alerts preferably by email blast and have people sign up for potential jobs. From there we would see all the people who signed up and make sure they are qualified and slot them into a custom roster made up of all the jobs listed in the alert. Some sort of input validation for profile information and sorting based on information on profiles would be included. We would like to be able to fill the roster via drag and drop from an admin page which I think can be done with a little jQuery. Other things we want to do in the future is have people upload PDFs onto their profiles for specific documents. All profiles would be private so no one can access the information of other people. Also security would probably be another important feature we want to emphasize. Sorry if this was a long rambling list that makes no sense.

7901537,0,t1_d44768j,gtReading from files is not slow...Slow is a relative term. Memory reads should always be faster than disk reads and disk reads can slow down a lot if there are other disk operations going on at the same time. If you have the choice between reading once and caching the values in memory vs reading every time you need to weigh the costs and benefits.If its a value youre going to be reusing very regularly its probably better to load and cache. If you have a requirement that it picks up those changes live rereading is the way to go. If youre dealing with a huge dataset that takes a long time to load but you have a lot of available memory caching is the better way to go. If youre dealing with an infrequently accessed value ondemand loading would probably be better.I guess my point is its hard to generalize this kind of thing.

That said it might not be to your advantage to insult your current partner while seeking out another.  Im sure you mean well but its a bit offputting. Id be happy to help you with any questions you might have though not as a committed partner but as a random stranger on the Internet.  You can also post any questions here on this subreddit or riosprogramming and Im sure others will help you too.As an aside since ObjectiveC is all but deprecated you might want to invest in learning Swift.  ObjectiveC is still incredibly useful to know since countless libraries and tutorials were written using it but Swift is the future of iOS development.

7943622,0,t1_d4895g5,There are excellent git resources on the interweebs. This is probably something that we should have in our FAQ if we dont already.Try this and see if it makes sense to you.Git is a tool or collection of tools that let you manage and track changes to files usually source code but it can be other things as well. You can look at older versions of your code develop features independently of the main code merge them back in and much more. This is vital when working with multiple developers but its also very very useful when its just you. Most of us have had the case of taking working code making some changes and then discovering that the changes dont work or are a bad idea. No problem we think Ill just put the code back the way it was. I dont have source code control but how hard can it be?. Two hours later you have the code back the way you thought it was but the damn thing doesnt work any more. Source code control eliminates this problem.Or perhaps you are picking up an old project and cant quite remember where you were in the development. Git and other source code control systems give you a revision history. Assuming you wrote good comments when you submitted code you should be able to figure out your own thought processes from daysweeksmonths ago. This is incredibly useful.Those are just a couple of the reasons why you want source code control. Why git? Well its really popular and works well. How do you use it?

8127973,0,t1_d4tnb2t,Nope because the way a git repository works is by storing what they calls diffs of each commit. I think the best way to explain this is with an exampleLets say you start a new completely empty repo. You then add a .mp file and commit it. The repo takes mb of space. Youre unhappy with that file so you decide to delete it. The repo still takes mb of space. Why? Because the file is in a previous commit which means that if you cloned the repo and went back to that previous commit youd have access to that file unaltered. Theres no compression or anything done to the file so its kept unaltered the only thing that is done is what they call diffs where you take a file see what is different between this file and the current commit and change it. This way you can go back in forth in between versions and be cetain that you have complete and unaltered files but at the cost of never being able to get rid of files you have committed. This is why you should include a gitignore before starting your repo so you never commit files that can be generated by your IDE or files that could be downloaded with the latest version not always the case but in some projects it makes more sense.,learnprogramming,d4tnood,1,t5_2r7yd

8328111,0,t3_4tmxaq,Are you using Codecademy by any chance?Then I would understand the feeling of not actually learning. Codecademy mainly teaches syntax but not actual programming. I would go so far to say that it is not really for absolute beginners but rather for people with some experience who want to get a quick glance at a different programming language.Id actually recommend Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Invent Your Own Computer Games with PythonBoth are free to read online very beginner friendly and use actual programs to teach Python.The main difference to Codecademy is that they dont have an integrated editor and that they use Python .x versus Codecademys Python .xGenerally the feeling that you dont understand much or that you dont have learned much is a typical beginners problem. But that is nothing to really be concerned about.Programming is a difficult skill to acquire because it involves far more than learning a programming language in your case Python. It also involves learning to think in a different way to approach problems in a different way  like a programmer. This is the actually difficult part. You can improve that particular skill with a fairly simple exerciseDont despair! Take it slowly dont rush. If you have the feeling that you dont understand something go back and reread the information. Take lots of breaks to give your brain time to process the information.Good luck with your journey into programming!,learnprogramming,d5ikhse,4,t5_2r7yd

It should later be refined  every time.As soon as you find yourself writing identical code blocks or even worse copypasting code blocks you need to refactor. Any repetitive code needs to go into a method function everything else is wrong because it requires way too much maintenance.Thats where books and tutorials come into play they teach proper practices  things a selfdiscovering programmer will not find out by themselves.Sure learning by doing is a valid approach but there need to be fundamentals and best practices learned before going the by doing alone road.Good tutorials teach both at the same time proper practices and by doing.Id strongly recommend that you go through the one or other tutorial to settle the very fundamentals and to learn proper practices.Sure your approach will also get you to the targets but it makes  a huge difference if you get there in a straight line proper code or with plenty detours clobbered together.Since you mentioned that you are learning Python Id recommend Invent with Python by uAlSweigart Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by uAlSweigart The above link directly to the online versions of the books which are free to read online.,learnprogramming,d5tcgem,4,t5_2r7yd

8426182,0,t3_4v25v5,Off the top of my head maybe you can define win condition grids. Which will most likely just overcomplicate things but its fun....For instance...    This is a flattened representation so indices  are the first row  second row  are the last row.Is one win condition.   and  might be a boolean if it makes it easier. So lets say you define all your win conditions and have some list of them. When someone places a token down you can iterate through each win condition and see if it matches the state of the board for that player. Youre basically bit masking positions on the board. The fun of this is you can define different win conditions! Maybe to win your version of tic tac toe you have to have  sets of pieces that are across from each other like    x  x    o o o    x  xIn this case X wins! You can define that win condition as             So youd only have to implement the logic to AND together wincondition representation of the board and the playerrepresentation of the board. If you do that you can easily change how someone wins the game and you eliminate a lot of ifelse statements.,learnprogramming,d5utbj8,2,t5_2r7yd

They have their own language and streamline a lot of things for you to get a game made. Unreal Engine  Im sure that some people will disagree with me but Unreal Engine is a good place to start for noncoders because their blueprint system is really easy to get into and has a decent user base creating tutorials and documentation. Youre also able to extend your project in the future with native c codethough C is a beast for new programmers if you want to get into doing things that the blueprint system cant the blueprint system can do pretty much everything you need however. Unity this is last on my list because there is no easymode for nonprogrammers. C is a much easier language than c. Unity also has the most hobbyist users creating tutorial content for you to work off of. In summary if you want to start immediately with the nitty gritty coding go with Unity. If you want to do as little coding as possible try for Game Maker.

8494589,0,t3_4w246o,There are always physical locations where servers are housed these locations are called data centers.In massive data centers and for services like Azure or AWS where the servers themselves are commodity data is replicated to several different machines. A common technique is to have one as the source of truth and to have one or more machines possibly in different locations act as replicas. If something should happen to the main machine traffic is manually or automatically redirected to one of the replicas. This process is called mirroring and failover.In a service I worked on our internal network was divided hierarchically to help with management. At one level things were divided by the physical data center that the machines were located in. Within a data center the machines were further divided into farms and the farms were divided into several stamps. A farm was a logical unit which represented a common set of services such as authentication and data storage for a set of customer accounts. A stamp was a generic set of machines that made up the physical implementation of the farm. Each farm had a bit of redundancy built in to help with upgrade scenarios with the redundant machines conceptually working as swap space.This division allowed us to service and monitor the system at a fairly granular level. We could monitor the health of each farm individually upgrade them individually and work with them as is they were a single entity in many cases but we also had a similar level of control over the entire data center or collection of data centers we used.In terms of how they were physically managed there were people whose job it was to manage the physical machines. They would typically add or replace things at the level of a stamp rather than at the level of single machines. The specifics of that level of management were outside the scope of what I needed to work with so I dont know the details beyond that.,learnprogramming,d63dgvd,1,t5_2r7yd

On line  you can see they initialize with their OAuth.io key.. OAuth.io has over  API providers one of them being Twitter. On line  they want to make a pop up twitter auth window appear. This function takes in a callback function that will execute after someone has tried to login with the parameters for an error and response object. As you can see they dont check for errors in their callback for the sake of the demo but if you are planning on doing this for real you absolutely should.. The response object allows one to make requests to the API as you can see on line  they are making a GET request to the timeline status route. I imagine OAuth.io is putting in valid request parameters for you behind the scenes. Once we get a response back from the API we call a function done that takes in a function as its parameter that holds the data we just got back from our request as our response.. Next on line  once they have the twitter timeline feed they are locating and compiling their handlebars template so they can put the information they got the from the twitter API onto the page. They referenced their script tag with an id entrytemplate. Next you have a jquery animation slideUp to hide the connect button then we start injecting data into the DOM we made a div tag ahead of time called res with jQuery and handlebars. Notice in our template we have something called each data. So thats where htmltemplatedatadata comes from template is a function that returns some valid HTML and we are passing in an object with the key being the variable we used in the template data and passing in the right data as the value. We also call a slideDown animation on it.. The last bit function outside the callbacks is registering a helper link that uses a regex pattern looking for valid links and replacing the link text with ltagtltagt tags so that they are clickable ?,learnprogramming,d67yp9d,1,t5_2r7yd

8544347,0,t1_d692iog,For anyone else this is all specific to ASP.NET which is what the OP is asking about. MS uses some very generic terms to name their very specific framework.So MVC and WebAPI controllers are similar but they have some key differences.MVC Controllers can render a view. You gather some data do some work then pass a model to a View engine and the engine renders the view with that model which results in HTMLCSSJS text thats sent back to the browser to display.WebAPI controllers dont render views. They typically serialize your model and pass that along to the caller. The caller can be anything JavaScript some other application whatever. Instead of getting back a rendered page theyre getting back serialized data most likely as JSON. Then they can do whatever they want with that data.If you were building a Single Page Application using Angular or React you wouldnt use MVC controllers for your data. You dont want an entire set of HTML to come back to you. You just want the data so your client can do what it needs to do with it.If youre using MVC and building a more traditional web page you dont need or even necessarily want to use Web API.,learnprogramming,d69m3nb,1,t5_2r7yd

8719472,0,t3_4zep0w,In the example in that course theres two constructors. One takes a name and an age. The other takes just a name and sets the age to a default value of . Default values like this is probably the most common use of calling another constructor. By having one constructor call another constructor you only have to actually write initialization code in one constructor and the other constructor can just call that one. This saves you from having to write two copies of almost identical code and also has the advantage that if you need to change the initialization code you only need to change it once and the other constructor will automatically be right. You cant call the same constructor. That would end up causing infinite recursion. You have to call a different constructor for the class.In Java a function is identified not only by its name but also by the number and type of arguments it takes. Constructors are a little different than regular functions but still when you call a constructor the compiler will pick the one with parameters that match what you passed it. When you call a constructor with the this keyword it looks for that constructor in the current class which does necessarily have the same name as the class because thats the rule for constructors. You are correct that in Java the order of things within a class does not matter. The compiler is pretty smart at being able to find things. ,learnprogramming,d6vkogh,1,t5_2r7yd

8722694,0,t1_d6voma0,It would just be String int. It doesnt care what the name is because when you call a constructor or any other function the only way you tell the compiler which overload you want is by putting the right type arguments in the right order. You dont specify the name of an argument when youre calling something. Are you asking what would happen if you had one constructor that took String name int age and another one that took String name int weight or something like that? Youd get an error if you tried to compile code that had both of those because they have the same number and type of arguments. Thats not allowed because it makes it impossible to determine which one you meant to call. And youre always allowed to write as many constructors as you want without calling any other constructor but if you find yourself writing similar code twice or more times you should think about if calling another constructor could reduce the code duplication. ,learnprogramming,d6vz7ho,2,t5_2r7yd

8748965,0,t3_4zuneb,It depends on the hardware. And to some extent on the software.For a long time commercially available PCs all used singlecore processors. Multithreading existed but it was just an abstraction to make things convenient for programmers. The actual CPU only did one thing at a time and switched between threads many times every second in order to make it seem like many things were happening simultaneously.However for some time now PCs have been built with actual multicore processors. In general this means the CPU really can execute multiple threads at once. For instance Im currently running an FX with  cores at .GHz. The FX actually has  physical cores but each one can handle  threads at a time by doubling up on some parts of the circuit and flipping between instructions on every clock cycle so physically its really a GHz device. But each of the  physical cores can literally be doing its own thing in whatever thread its handling at exactly the same time. The caches and memory buses are designed to handle multiple requests coming in from these different cores simultaneously in order to make sure the data doesnt get screwed up.Regarding your example I dont know what sort of machine youre using whether its singlecore or multicore. Even if its multicore the thread scheduler may put both threads on one core if it thinks theyre of sufficiently low priority or if you have other programs doing stuff at the same time or if your CPU is running hot. But either way you have to keep in mind that writing characters to the output buffer is really fast way faster even than the speed at which the thread scheduler swaps between threads which in turn is faster than your monitors refresh rate anyway so its not surprising for multiple sequences of the same character to appear right after each other. Also your machine has other stuff going on too in the background and each call to Console.Write takes multiple CPU cycles and you dont know exactly how the console buffer is even implemented so its not very realistic to expect two threads to exactly keep pace with each other in writing characters to the console which would be necessary to produce the xyxyxyxyxyxy effect whether youre running a multicore machine or not.,learnprogramming,d6z9xs8,1,t5_2r7yd

How much do you need to learn in each language?  How determined do you have to be to learn all those languages to that depth?Creativity is a hard thing to define too.  You have to get a sense of what people like.  If youre a musician for example some songs are likely to please lots of people some arent.  When you watch a singing competition show there arent many people that sing opera and expect to succeed because these shows are marketed to pop songs.  Similarly certain kinds of games are likely to do well.And then its possible some games succeed because of good management that no single person can write the entire app e.g. Pokemon Go so someone has to manage that process.So there are lots of factors.,learnprogramming,d71i2q4,1,t5_2r7yd

All these question find their own answer once you know a The clients expectations  if they want a totally unique once off site with very specific requirement then possibly the likes of Wordpress of magento isnt going to cut it. Even if they only want a simple off the shelf solution there will still be a maintenance cost regardless the amount of times Ive migrated ecommerce sites from ridiculously outdated and insecure Wordpress versions and dodgy hosting providers. This is something you should make clear that you will handle even if it is for a modest retainer its very little work and if you build a portfolio of clients it can make a nice mostly passive income.  Clients ability to pay  theres no point promising the earth moon and stars if there isnt the cash to back up development costs. To build out even a basic enough ecommerce style site from scratch is going to take exponentially longer than using off the shelf solutions  not to mention youre putting yourself in a position of handling security. If customer data such as email addresses passwords or worse CC info  Ive seen all too many horror storys of ransomware attacking small business sites.In my opinion often a best of both worlds approach is the way to go. Major functionality let the tried and tested platforms take care of the heavy lifting be sure to keep them up to date. To give your sites a unique look and feel by all means go crazy with your own custom styling by whatever means CSS etc. But lay the cards on the table and tell your client what it is exactly theyll be paying for mentioning secure installation and upkeep,learnprogramming,d8al225,3,t5_2r7yd

9151068,0,t1_d8bxpii,gt its hard to find something useful thats not too big of a projectYou pretty much hit the nail on the head with that statement. Here is what I would suggest for someone who wants to get into web development and you can likely follow a similar path for raspberry pi development but the resources available may be limited a bit more.. Find a tutorial that walks you step by step through building a real application. Eg in Ruby on Rails there is  that walks you through building a twitter clone.. Read the booktutorial and follow along. Try to understand things but dont get too worried if something doesnt click at first. Your goal at first is to just get through the book and build something.. Go back through the book and try to further your understanding by deviating from what the book says to do and trying different stuff. For example try adding new fields to the user signup page. Try changing the URL paths your website uses. Try creating a new page that the book doesnt include. If you ever find anything you dont completely understand or even if you do understand it experiment with it to see what happens. . Pick a project that is similar to what you build in the book. For example if you built a twitter clone maybe this time you want to build a simplified reddit clone. Make sure this is a very simple project and is comparable in features to the original project. For example you cant go build a twitch.tv clone with a book on building a twitter clone because you will have no idea how to handle video streams but you can likely create something like a reddit clone.. Go through the booktutorial again except this time your goal is to use the code in every chapter as guidance to create your own application. For example if the first thing you do in the book is create static pages try creating your own for your application first. If the next thing you do is create an authentication system build your own next. If you then start creating the tweet resource in the book try creating the post and comment resources for your reddit clone.This last step will help illustrate what you dont understand so you have a few options if you get stuck. You can ask on reddit stack overflow etc. You can reread the booktutorial and experiment with the code. Or you can Google for your specific issue. You might even be able to email the creator of the booktutorial. Most people who write educational content are happy to help out. Regardless of what you do try to be specific about what is blocking you. Reference the book and say what similar thing is done in the book explain what you are trying to do in your own application and include any errors or other information you can to help others help you debug.The biggest thing I want to stress is that your experience will directly correlate to the quality of the book or tutorial you opt to follow so spend some time researching your options and find a good one to follow along with. Unfortunately I dont know python very well so I cant recommend any for you.,learnprogramming,d8byq2w,2,t5_2r7yd

You can look up the various pros and cons of the implementations  mostly differences in allocation speed and access speed. It would be slightly very very slightly more efficient to use an array based stack in your exact scenario. This is due to .. Generally if the max size of the stack is known  arrays will be better. If your stack is changing size often then linked lists are better.. If your data objects are large arrays are a little worse. If your data objects are small primitive types then arrays are slightly better.. Linked lists are better at insertdelete operations in the middle of the stack. Arrays are better at traversingsearching the stack.. Linked lists can take up more memory in some scenarios because it has to allocate pointers for each entry.,learnprogramming,d8wahye,1,t5_2r7yd

Now selecting them joining tables etc on a huge scale repeatedly will murder your system. This is where you need to take care of sharding splitting your database into smaller pieces so you for example will have some columns in one database and some in another hold users from A to N in one and M to Z in another might consider using Redis MongoDB etc on top of SQL for values that are less critical to be saved but will be loaded repeatedly a lot. Honestly at that point its not about database engine you choose but about specific decisions on what to load to RAM is it fine if that data is queued to be saved rather than guaranteed to be saved if you need transactions how will you query for it trying to find a specific string in ten million elements array is not the best idea if its possible to split the data into multiple databases or tables is it fine to get rid of older elements and so on and on.If amount of data is truly IMMENSE but older records for example are not needed that often  then you only leave few days worth in the database rest goes to separate files to which your DB will point if user requires it.

9467235,0,t3_5adn3k,All the short answers on here have been really good anecdotes. Maybe I can add a more indepth one more specific to the question of a programming language.But first its important to understand how much concepts transcend programming language. If someone is an expert in other languages it because much easier to jump straight through beginner to intermediate in a week or less on a new language. There is a lot of stuff that goes into this e.g. that theyve mastered all of the paradigms before in the languages they are experts at. BeginnerA beginner is someone who has learned the fundamentals of the language. Basically meaning one of its key paradigms usually imperative functional declarative but potentially also homoiconic objectoriented etc. and the associated features InputOutput functionality of some sort Abstraction     Variables e.g. variables classes     Subroutines e.g. functions methods Conditional execution e.g. if switch case destructuring Iteration or recursion e.g. for foreach map reduceA beginner will likely learn a couple of libraries and begin to understand how the compiler or runtime complains about errors some of the more interesting tricks or the language but often not a deeper understand of why those tricks exist or how they work with other things etc. and bits and pieces of more advanced features and paradigms. They often dont know how much of the language is left to learn. IntermediateSomeone who is an intermediate with the language will begin to know how much of the language they dont know. They will be aware of  at least at a beginners level  all of the paradigms the language offers and will have mastered at least one of them. Mastering a paradigm means Knowing all the keywords and language features of the paradigm e.g. decorating attributes like const. Knowing how all the keywords and features interact with each other e.g. static and const. Knowing how to implement the common design patterns used with in the paradigm e.g. singletonThey will likely also know many common libraries for the language as well as some more intermediate ones which often require using common patterns. A lot of learning a language is the community around it. An intermediate programmer will know the common libraries used for things like websites user interface structural frameworks concurrency etc.But most importantly an intermediate user of a programming language will understand how the language compiler andor runtime works. Meaning they wont need IDE support like a beginner often will and will be able to architect their program as required basically meaning they could write a plugin system for their programming language doesnt mean it will be good. It also means they have a perhaps limited understanding of how the language works under the hood how are anonymous functions implemented? when does boxingunboxing happen? how does garbage collection interact with the program? how does a class implement iteration? ExpertAn expert has mastery of all or at least most of the paradigms offered by the language but they have also mastered a cross paradigm understanding of the language its this cross paradigm mastery that allows them to quickly get up to speed on other languages Knowing how different paradigms features interact how do properties and attributes interact and the fact that question works for different languages in different ways is hilarious.  Knowing how to implement cross paradigm design patterns e.g. facade.     As well as knowing the common language specific design patterns e.g. INotify in C.An expert will know how to build a good canonical custom library. They will understand how other libraries are implemented. They will know the internals of some of the major libraries. They will know not just how to implement plugin systems well they will know how to interact with plugins and libraries of other languages. And they will understand how their compiler and runtime works internally how to extend it or use it in nonstandard ways e.g. as a webserver OS driver etc.,learnprogramming,d9g1ehx,4,t5_2r7yd

Initially let p equal  the smallest prime number.gt . Enumerate the multiples of p by counting to n from p in increments of p and mark them in the list these will be p p p ...  the p itself should not be marked.gt . Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number stop. Otherwise let p now equal this new number which is the next prime and repeat from step .To mark them I would just set the integers to . All numbers left over from the process that are gt would be prime numbers. This saves a lot of processing time. Removing items from a vector is slow in comparison.Division is expensive and youre checking numbers that are clearly not multiples. Its a huge waste of time. Rather then checking for a remainder with the modulus operator just use addition and eliminate the indices you land on. You defeat the purpose of the algorithm by checking each number for factors.

9615953,0,t1_d9y50ud,My first attempt to learn C was with Sozobon C on the Atari ST circa .All I had was a magazine tutorial and it was preinternet so there was no Stack Overflow or Google to help.I ended up giving up and sticking to assembly due to the difficulty the poor performance and the HYUUUGE binaries the C compiler produced. In addition because it was a single tasking OS I had to open an editor edit then quit the editor and run the compiler read the error log then rinse and repeat.TLDR  You young whippersnappers got it easy.,learnprogramming,d9yd46n,17,t5_2r7yd
9621202,0,t1_d9yytod,Assembly is human readable representation of machine code. An assembler reads the assembly code and creates an object module which contains the s and s that processor can understand. Theres one more stage after assembly  linking. The machine code in object module can make calls for external resources functions in other object modules for example and linking adjusts the references to those external resources so that they can function correctly. Basically in computer once you leave the space of binary code in processor everything is an abstraction upon abstraction. Everything is actually binary but working with binary and programming with s and s is very ineffective and we wouldnt be where we are today without building those abstractions. So a language like C for example compiles to assembly which is then compiled to machine code simplifying here. Operating systems are written in C and they create the abstractions of user space allocate memory for other programs and so on. Then on higher level you can use languages like python or java and for example you dont have to manually allocate and clear memory like you need in C. This allows for more effective programming and lets programmers focus on features rather than lowlevel stuff.Whats also interesting is that languages like Java or Ruby use virtual machines for further abstractions. Any code that is compiled to assembly needs to be compiled differently for different processor architecture. So you cant just compile a program for x on your computer than send it to your phone that uses ARM architecture and expect it to work. ARM and x use different instructions binary code created from assembly would mean different things on those processors. So what VMs do is they abstract the processor and memory. When you create a variable in a language like Java and compile the code you dont create an assembly instruction meant for processor. You create an instruction for VM which then makes instructions for processor in memory. This way in order to make Java code work on x and ARM both you dont need to have different Java compilers you just need to implement the VM for both architectures.Hope this helps. TLDR  starting from binary in processor and memory everything in computer is an abstraction. Its also important when programming on higher level. Knowing when to use abstraction and what to abstract is an important skill that is not easily learnt.,learnprogramming,d9z0eu1,15,t5_2r7yd

Hence clicked will always be  even on the second click because it is a different clicked.Create the EventHandler instance outside the loop and then assign only the created instance.But in order for this to work you need to use the e.getSource method rather than passing the button instance into the Eventhandler.Drop the button instance in Eventhandler and use e.getSource to identify which button was clicked.BTW who taught you to use underscores for private members?

You can always appreciate the premise and make it work your own way or even do it better that me.Plots just the same as you wrote theres a programming course and an aplication youre learning to build. The lecturer introduces new programming concepts and shows you how to improve your skills and then implement all the stuff being taught into the applications project.  Its just that all the stuff youve supposedly been taught how to deal with is only applicable for the project getting all attention from the lecturercourse. Youre virtually unable to use that knowledge on your own. Every time you try and create something from the bottom up you fail. It was like that for me at least.Course project offered to teach a project to manage soccer training practice sessions using proper OO techniques of course. So I tried doing something similar to it an application to help a small courier business. I couldnt wrap it up even though it was just  different from what I learned just before. I felt like an idiot.  I downloaded a ton of other resources from that point on and spent several days figuring out how were these different from the material Ive been struggling with. There were books that relied on good C language practices to explain undrerlying concepts of classes video tutorials showing how to do regular stuff with less common methods and functions entire collections of wellcommented code and so on. It wasnt just the sheer volume of it but also the variety of approaches to explaining stuff like inheritance and patterns. I could lie and say it wasnt overwhelming but it was so in a good way.I picked up a book or two on the same topic and typed in all the examples myself. I even took the advice to test projects debug some of them and did all the exercises. Those were hundreds after hundreds of really simple programs very explanative and concise. It was only after doing so that I was able to reconnect with the initial programming course finish my tangent project and whats more I started having fun while programming. I set up a small web server to remind me how many clean socks I have and whens the next Chelsea game. I made a mockup paint app that saves an image of the middle finger and the file name instead of the drawing.

9770915,0,t3_5f3lyg,First of all dont feel demotivated about what Im going to tell you. You are obviously a beginner and are going to make a lot of beginner mistakes. This is perfectly normal and we all made these mistakes and learned from them.For now forget about people lending a hand on a project like this. Its never going to happen since this project doesnt really fill a need for them. I have quite a few github projects myself and only one is popular simply because its an example that others can use. Of all the clones and stars I only had like  pull requests issues to me for simple spelling errors.As far as your code. For a beginner youre doing great youre building functional stuff yourself. But the code itself is what youd expect from a beginner pretty horrible  Ill get to that later but first a few gitgithub basics.First of all you dont have a license. Putting code out there on the web doesnt make it open source. Just because its visible doesnt mean its not yours and this means that even if people wanted they are not allowed to modify your code. In theory if I would issue a pull request with some changes you could sue me this is very theoretical obviously. So you should start with adding an open source license to all your project. If you dont know which one to pick use the MIT license.Secondly you should not include any binaries compiled class files or .exe files into your project. These change every time and git keeps your entire history. So this will make your repository grow fast. Keep in mind that if someone forks your repo they also get all that crap you ever put there that should not be there. The same applies to your IDE config those are personal so your Eclipse config should not be in git. What should be in git though is your entire history. Its obvious you created the entire program and only then committed it and pushed it to github. Git is a version control system first and foremost and you really should use it as such. As for your Java code it works but its pretty bad. You should learn to use collections. If you name your vars like name name etc. its a sign youre doing it wrong. Names of vars and methods should always tell someone what its for. part is just wrong.Secondly try to follow the single responsibility principle. A method and class should be responsible for one thing only. A class should not both contain data and handle the painting of the user interface.

9783003,0,t3_5fbije,gt I have been programming for about a year and a halfSo youre somewhere around beginner to intermediate. A year and a half is fairly short in programming terms.gt  The main problem I tend to have is that I can learn a certain task and I read up its documentation and how it is implemented in example and I understand how it works. However trying to do it in my own programs or projects I tend to find difficult because the way I may end up having to use that skill is slightly different than the examples or code I looked at.Here you have a few problems You look at solutions and are able to implement them but you dont fully understand them  you need to understand the solution conceptually not the actual code used. You seem to tend to focus more on code than on concepts.   Learn concepts not code.The key is not to think in code but in concepts. This way slightly different requirements dont push you off track that quickly.gt I was wondering if anyone else here has been in my shoesNo nobody ever. Seriously each and every programmer has gone through that. Dont let anybody tell you different. For some it was easier for some it was more difficult.Your question is so common that it even has a FAQ entry How can I improve my skill to convert tasksproblems into programs Algorithmic thinking?gt knows or could give me tips on how to get better in applying what I have learnedHonestly the only way to improve is through practice and hard work. Try to use only documentation and dont look at example solutions. Work with pencil and paper. Devise solutions in plain text on paper whiteboard whatever non electronic. Draw write plain text write pseudocode whatever works best for you. Then move on to the computer.If you get stuck try for some time and then leave it. Do something different take a walk take a shower go to a pub if youre of legal age watch TV play a game anything that takes your conscious mind off the problem. Your subconscious mind will keep processing the problem and quite often come up with a solution when you least expect it.Time is a crucial factor here. Not the time it takes to come up with a solution. Not the time it takes to implement the solution. The key time is the time that you give your brain to process the information thoroughly.Many beginners make one common mistake they get an assignmentdo a challengeor anything alike and they immediately start hacking away. Dont do that. Take time to ponder over the problem. Give your brain time to process the problem. IMO also a common misbelief is to do everything digital. Digital tools are all fine and good but not when your brain needs to process something because the digital tools are too distracting. Plain old pencil and paper or a whiteboard work best here.Its far easier and better to sketch out a flowchart or some UML on paper than to produce a neatly formatted flowchart or UML with a drawingUML tool on the computer. While handdrawing your brain processes because youre more familiar and more natural with the tools. Using digital tools leads to distractions I need to align this need to format that differently etc.  all things that your brain processes while being taken off the actual problem.Take things slow. Programming is difficult and takes time to learn. Try things. Try many things. The worst that can happen is that your solutions dont work. Nothing can seriously break. In the worst case you might have to restart your computer  so what?Accept failure as part of the learning process. Embrace failure. It is equally important to know how not to do things as it is to know how to do things. Failure is gained experience and thus beneficial.,learnprogramming,daiyvsz,16,t5_2r7yd

9831558,0,t3_5fzoau,Programming languages are kind of like natural languages just more formal and thus strict.You can easily apply linguistics to that and methods of learning natural languages.You need to learn the grammar and alphabet syntax and all the words keywords and also the standard libraries.Words are the essence. Where do they come from? That heavily depends on the area you aredoing development on. Compare this to an author writing a scifi novel vs. an author writing apaper about nuclear physics.For programming languages you find your words in the libraries. You need to study them and how theyare used to formulate useful sentences. To actually acquire the skill to speak write read and hear a language you need hands on experience.You need to dotry it. You need to speak japanese to speak it well. You need to listen to german tounderstand it. You need to write chinese to get better at writing it. And you need to read what has beenwritten to get better at that. All that applies to programming languages too. Without practice noneural paths in your brain are formed and all the nice words and syntax you learned are just dry fact basedknowledge.And even if you know all that you might not yet be able to actually code. Compare that with anauthor who knows his language but does have absolutely no clue how to tackle composinga long text like a novel. Novels are usually also developed just that the author of novelsthink in terms of characters stories stereotypes to use and apply. All based on hisherexperience.A programmer needs problem solving skills to break down a problem into solvable bits.At that stage he can if he practiced put together the learned syntaxes and words to formulatea textsource code that solves the problem.And then you can dive into mystic stuff like data structures and software architecture to learnhow to formulate betterfastermore maintanable solutionsprograms. Just as a novel authorneeds to study the subject of what makes up a good story.You can compare code bases to bookspapers too. You need to be familiar with the subjectand have already read or written something similiar to get better at understanding thecode base or book at hand.Someone that never read or wrote a paper about nuclear physics will not be able to understanda paper about it on the first read. He has to research the subject and gain all the referencedknowledge first.That is why a programmer that usually codes games might have problems understanding the codebase of an industry robot controller. Or why a operating system kernel developer might notknow how to code a D engine.Just because you can read does not mean you can pick out an arbitrary book from an arbitraryshelf in a library and understand it.,learnprogramming,dap2npd,1,t5_2r7yd

9840593,0,t3_5g3gun,Typescript is a superset of ES and has other object oriented friendly stuff thrown in. This is what people usually refer to as syntactic sugar. A big thing that typescript can help you in is by allowing you to use types for your variables and letting you know if you make a mistake. This isnt a big deal in smaller projects and only becomes necessary as the size of a project gets large and you start working with multiple poeple. I would not learn typescript ATM even though it is backed by googles angular.js team. Its not raw language. You have to have a second transpiling step to take it from what you see as typescript as its converted back down to ES or ES. Every time you add a layer between what youre writing and what its going to do when it spits it out is bad. I would definitely suggest npm node and ES. The other stuff is less set in stone and could change in the future. For instance if Angular  takes off and more big companies start pushing for strongly types javascript then at that point in time you can make the decsiion to learn typescript. Although if you already know java theres nothing really to learn. ,learnprogramming,daq93k1,1,t5_2r7yd

10053999,0,t3_5jpa5t,Im an advanced beginner I guess learning iOS. Ive built a bunch of trifling things for myself and am now working on my first real production app.It sounds to me like adding AI to the game is just another whole thing entirely and  I assume?  a real challenge to pull off. If thats the case I think youre out of your mind to keep going here especially since this is just a learner project to learn Python not A.I.. For me thats the thing. Stopping and starting projects is one thing but not taking on massive projects especially ones that are going to take you out of your main stream is a key discipline as well.Just to cover the bases you writegt should I just leave it and come back to it later since there are a lot of other interesting projects Obviously if you are quitting just because there are a lot of other things youd like to do that on its own is a bad reason. But I am assuming from the rest of your post that the real reason is that AI is a big program to write and a bit of a cul de sac as well. If thats the case drop this without another thought.

This means new nodes are created which lack the click handlers that you bound previously.Also youll need to make sure that you have a scope surrounding the definition of the anonymous click handler function so that the function isnt using the value of the temp variable i which is homeworkArray.length after exiting the function.

When an interviewer is going through candidates though it really makes a difference I think when someone is clear about what theyre enthusiastic about and why.  The professors in my department just talk down to me as if Im stupid and roll their eyes or barely restrain sneers when I tell them what Im enthusiastic about.  The difference is that interviewers and employers are really interested in what they can get out of you.  Professors are only interested in how you either confirm or threaten their biases and other selfabsorbed focus they bring to their work.  Their livelihoods dont depend on an individual students ability to pull in a solution for the team or create something solid.  However employers need that kind of production worker.

Id say when I first started I got consumed in making cool apps and trying to read code syntax of languages and just so much stuff. If you truly want a good base Id say grab a Udemy class in Data Structures and Algorithms. Thats a very scaleable thing to learn. When you learn the concepts and logic behind writing sorting algorithms linked lists etc ... you can easily scale that into whatever language youd like to learn. It will also help you read code from a logical standpoint and develop a creative way to implement basic structures.,learnprogramming,dd0lpsf,2,t5_2r7yd
10524781,0,t3_5qpqfs,Youre pretty much using algorithms and data structures right from the start if youre doing anything more complex than just arithmetic with some local variables. If you can understand this    int max  someArray    for int i   i lt someArray.length i         if igtmax maxi    then you already know how to do a linear search in an array. Thats a data structure and a super common algorithm thats used with it. So if you know the basics of programming at all youre going to be learning about data structures and algorithms regardless of whether you formally study them. Its definitely useful to learn how to describe them formally and learn at least the most widely used data structures. This class on coursera gives you a pretty good overview of common data structures and associated algorithms Id recommend watching some of the week  videos and if you dont feel totally lost then keep going dont worry too much about the course start date and assignment due dates the materials are always available I think. The coursera class does assume you know the basics of object oriented programming so if youve never used classes in Java before you might want to delve into OOP a bit first but other than that I wouldnt say there are many prerequisites. ,learnprogramming,dd13jq7,11,t5_2r7yd

In any case with no context these questions seem a little unfair given that there could be multiple answers but if there was more context it sounds like you may need to brush up on whichever technology you were discussing.,learnprogramming,dd2xbh9,2,t5_2r7yd
10543652,0,t3_5qz342,Dear god no its not logn.  You iterate over every element in the array until you find one so its On.  Its logn when you repeatedly eliminate a fraction of the items you are searching until you find the correct one like  or  or maybe  of them.  A binary search is log n because every time you look at a number in the array you see which half of the remaining elements cannot have the element youre searching for and you only continue to search through the other half.In your code you are searching through  items in every iteration.  You are not eliminating half of the remaining elements in each iteration.,learnprogramming,dd38o8l,6,t5_2r7yd

10623707,0,t1_ddbog9x,I read an article recently that said Microsoft is looking to break C and VB.Net apart more. For the last several years they have tried to keep them pretty comparable but they have seen that more developers use C while more beginners use VB.Net. Trying to have VB.Net keep up with C just makes it more complicated for those beginners.The article mentioned that VB.Net just due to the name or other reasons tended to be where people would jump to from writing VBA to help automate tasks in Office or other business applications.So VB.Net was used in the office to help the accounting department while C was used to create full and rich applications. Both areas are valuable. I think a lot of people who havent worked in a large company or who stick to pure development of the customer facing applications would be surprised by the amount of programming that is done to just run the business. None of it is pretty and the most important thing is how fast can you get it up and running and make changes as management changes their minds. Microsoft made a tool just for this a few years ago but I think its dead now.... either that or I just forget the name and they dont have great SEO around it.I think this was the article I read.

10712477,0,t3_5t6x21,For background Im a professional software engineer with about  years experience using C and a variety of other languages.gt What is it like to be a professional programmer? How is the daily routine like? What are the most common challenges you have to face? What is your responsability and what isnt?First and foremost I enjoy being a developer. Its a good career and attracts a lot of smart hardworking people.I start my morning routine by walking through my emails looking over the meeting and tasks I have lined up today and communicating the status of my work during my daily standup. Some days I spend a lot of time coding at my desk other days I spend all of my time in meetings sometimes I get a production bug with a severity of drop everything and fix it yesterday.We have a lot of development teams in my company and everyones work depends on other teams so we have to be careful to coordinate production pushes.We have  week development cycles called sprints. We start the sprint by walking through our backlog of work and prioritize the tasks that we believe we can complete within the sprint. Its not possible to estimate the number of hours it takes to complete work so we assign each task a certain number of points to roughly characterize the level of effort needed to complete the work. Our points are  trivial  xsmall  small  medium  large  xlarge or  sad times. Over a few dev cycles we can estimate a baseline number of points that our team can complete in one sprint which helps us estimate the amount of work we can take on each sprint.gt What you do when youre not performing well? What do you do when you get creative blocked cant solve a problem or even just get full of it? I often have moments like those and Im working on small projects. I imagine it would probably be bad for my performance ratings if I went a week without writing a single line of code right?Im at the point where I can write anything of any complexity on autopilot. Most applications have a very predictable regular structure that I rarely feel blocked.I do on occasion feel burnt out. I find it helps to break up the day by going on walks through the park in the afternoon and to go to the gym after work.My work is usually pretty good about having team outings and they even send me to programming conferences every so often these things help break up the monotony of routine work. I am also fortunate enough to work for a company which gives me  time so that I can use my Fridays to pursue interests independent of my normal work I use this time to study AI and work on personal projects.I also like to stack my vacation days to maximize my time off for example if I have a holiday on Monday I will take the Friday prior off for vacation so that I have a  day week MonThur  day vacation FriMon followed by another  day week TuesFri. I will almost always take the entire week off between Christmas and New Years which usually ends up being a  day sabbatical. Small blocks of time off like this keep me from being overworked. I know other programmers who like to save the last  or  days of their vacation until the end of the year then take every Friday off so that they have day weeks for the rest of the year.There are many days and even weeks where I dont write a single line of code but this doesnt mean Ive been unproductive. Quite often this means Ive spent a lot of my time in meetings hashing out new projects or coordinating work with other teams.My worst habit is being distracted. I often have multiple news articles open at once or sometimes spend too much time on reddit during the work day but Ive never missed deadlines or fallen behind on my work as a consequence of occasional distractions.gt Do everyone use git? How do people manage projects besides git? And what other tools should I know how to use to work in the industry?My team uses TFS for source control and planning. In the past Ive worked for companies that use SVN for source control and Jira for planning.gt How are tasks shared among professional programmers? How do you link everything up?Planning software such as TFS and Jira help with this process a lot.At my company an enterprisey planning committee identifies a few companywide projects that we want to focus on for the year. Each team carves out a slice of the project that they will be responsible for completing. From there we build a backlog of work that we need to complete our slice of the project then prioritize tasks in the backlog.Every  weeks we plan the work that we want to  complete over the next sprint so we pull tasks out of the backlog and commit to completing the work. Work that is not completed within a sprint is carried over to the next sprint.It is usually not possible to build a backlog of work for an entire year so we add tasks to it as needed. Every so often we have a backlog grooming session to determine whether tasks are still relevant or need to be reprioritized relative to other work.gt How are different languages tools and etc managed together? I have no clue how a multilanguage project is supposed to work but it seems to be the common standard.I have worked in dev shops that use every language under the sun e.g. multiple teams using either C Java PHP Coldfusion Ruby Python etc. Too many tools causes a lot of friction and makes it difficult for developers to transition between teams.Its almost always easier and preferable for dev shops to commit to one software stack. For example all .NET or all JVM or all NodeJs or all RubyRails.If you have to work with multiple languages its best if the languages naturally compliment one another. For example C and Powershell are both .NET languages so they work well together within their respective niches NodeJs and AngularJs are both Javascript frameworks so they work well Java and Scala are both JVM languages so they compliment each other.No matter how many languages are involved most software shops store their code in some kind of source control TFS Git SVN etc. and use a build system to automated the process of promoting code to devpreprodprod environments. A build system such as TFS or Jenkins can pull down the latest version of source control for a project run a set of commands to buildcompile the project run any automated unit tests and run commands to deploy the code out to various environments. The build system stores useful information about each build such as how long the build takes how many tests passed and whether any errors were encountered during the build or deploy.gt How do licensing really works? Is it managed by someone? Is there a list of licenses you can use? Do you have to read through the whole license agreement yourself? Do I need to learn basic law stuff?Intellectual property law grants the intellectual copyright of any creative work to the original creator. There are some exceptions When you work for a company your employment agreement almost always grants the copyright of software to your company not to the authors of the software. In practice this means that cannot transfer code you wrote at one company to another company as that would infringe on your previous employers copyright to the code. If the code contains trade secrets a copyright infringement could quickly escalate to corporate espionage. No one wants to deal with litigation of that sort so dont dont it. It also means that you cannot release code that you develop for your company as open source without specific permission from your employers legal department. Code that you develop outside of work belongs to you. You can choose to release your code under various licenses from very permissive licenses such as the MIT license to more restrictive licenses such as GPL to commercial proprietary licenses. You are responsible for enforcing your software license in the event that someone infringes on your work. There are various organizations which can enforce licenses on your behalf for nominal cost. Software libraries that you incorporate into your code should conform to the license. Most software companies Ive worked for do not permit the use of GPL or LGPL licensed software into proprietary or commercial software for this reason. Sometimes companies must pay a commercial license to use a piece of software in their project. Some companies such as Netflix Facebook Twitter and Microsoft write a lot of proprietary code but also give back to the community by open sourcing tools that they use internally.Hope that helps ,learnprogramming,ddkwu86,6,t5_2r7yd

So an API is an endpoint of communication between two things. For your situation you need a RESTful API an interface between the raspberry and an android phone. Most probably the phone is the client and the raspberry is the server. There should be strings of the IP the phone is requesting the data something like .... This is the network address the raspberry will have and will be similar you need to change it accordingly on the android project. The port is  could be something else. The http protocol you are using has several methods like GET POST PUT UPDATE and more. Check the developer tools of your browser network tab on chrome under method there should be a bunch of GET and POST at every refresh of every site you visit. Its just a way of your browser the client to say to the server Hey GET me the data for reddit.comrlearnprogramming and the server returns the HTML the client requested. Its the same idea behind your project. I hope I didnt confuse you more. Its way easier to write in Python using the frameworks I mentioned with Flash being more suitable.

11203412,0,t3_5zwhd1,gt So I have been trying to understand what this type safety means. A static type system can be defined as a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute.Type safe means that you can look at the text of the program and decide that a particular problematic behavior doesnt happen.In this case it means that you can look at the text of the program and decide that you never try to add different kinds of values to the same object.gt At that point the HashMap is locked in and will only accept the somethingsomething keyvalue pairing. How do you imagine that working?The point of the static type system is that myHashMap.putfoo bar fails at compile time if foo and bar are of the wrong type for the HashMap.On the other hand youve started with an expression with a type thats something like forall K V. HashMapltKVgt then you have another expression that fixes K and V to specific types.  However the previous expression still exists so you can statically refix those those types to some other K and V the way you did in the first place.  This would be fine in HashMap were a persistentimmutable data structure but its mutable.  This means that you can add an element from the expression where the HashMap is of type HashMapltFooBargt and observe it from the expression where its HashMapltBazQuuxgt.  This obviously is type unsafe.Because of that in Java you cant explicitly forall a generic type except at the method or class level e.g. in bool frobnifyltAgtA a ltAgt says that this method works forall A.So as stated what you want really cant be done.  Why do you want to do that?  There might be something similar that you can actually do.,learnprogramming,df1w4uu,1,t5_2r7yd

Think of it like a small computer running on the page the browser environment provides access to html and allows javascript to send and receive data over the internet.Nodejs doesnt run in a browser but on a server.If you have done simple web sites then your web servers will just be serving up pages and other resources you request. When you go to google for example you get the htmlcss for the page from the server.But servers can also serve up and receive data. For instance when you ask google to search for a page you send the server a string to search for. It will look for the most relevant web pages in a massive data base and build a web page that is then returned.If you want to know back end then you should learn one server side language nodejs php python java c etc. And you should also learn SQL for data base queries.After that you will need to understand JSON and Http for web requests.,learnprogramming,df6qoep,1,t5_2r7yd

You can easily test new solutions to your program and integrate them only once you are sure they are fine go over previous versions of it cooperate with other programmers it wont let you easily overwrite a file that someone else just changed and so on.

This will be very high level then Ill dive in to each component and do something kind of like a UML Class diagram just figure out what smaller parts within each larger component would make things work. Once this is done Ill do some initial wire framing and check how the UI will flow or Ill do some extra mapping if its just a piece of running software.Depending on how big the project is I might spin up some initial test cases or Ill wait until Ive started a bit to see if theres any major changes to the design if it smaller project.,learnprogramming,dfotf9t,2,t5_2r7yd

For example if we have an instance of a Trainer object how does that Trainer tell an instance of Runner in this case Joe to run?Well to answer this question we have to go back a bit.gtWhen I call a method for example in Java Im the one telling that object to perform a method.No. You are not. Youre trying to use everyday language to explain something that really shouldnt be explained like that. You are not the one calling the method the class you wrote is calling that method. You are running the class via a public static class in a package perhaps with some packages in between and it contains instructions that it needs to tell the object to perform a method. In fact even thats not correct you are not running the class your computer is running the class. And even that is not correct on a lot of levels but lets not get into that.Classes have variables and methods.

Not only can the while not see min in your example but neither will printf. Declare min outside the block and only assign from the do block. That puts min is scope of while and printf.Consider    int A      int total          ifA lt             A          int B          ifint A  B lt                     int C             total  A  B  C                     printftotalAny code block with more restrictive scope can see A and total. Only the inner if and its nested if block can see B and only the nested if can see C. At the printf statement B and C are both undefined. Its as if they never existed.

Youre noticing that some unexplained magic must be happening for first.c to know about second.cs function.It will depend on the compiler but for command line type compilers e.g. gcc etc. what roughly happens isThis is from memory and may not be exactly correct.second.c compiles to an object file second.o which contains the machine code implementation for secondfunction.first.c passes the compile because youve promised it in header.h so compiles to first.o but with a note that it has a subroutine call to secondfunction whose location is still unknown.Both of your .o files go into the linker whose job it is to combine the two object files together into one executable and resolve exactly this and replace the note with the address of the nowcombined secondfunction.As for main it is defined as the entry point that the linker will start in.You can test this out but defining a function in a header file but not implementing it anywhere.  The .c function will compile but when it goes to link it wont be able to find the function and will complain.

You can repeat this forever meaning that you can keep traversing this linked list.  But theres only finitely many nodes so a cycle must exist.Put another way theres no way youll traverse the linked list and end up at the end.  Oh were done theres no more edges to traverse.

But if you have experience with programming I recommend you going through Dive Into Python book If youd like to get handson experience with some projects check out this Reddit thread!Regarding motivation To learn effectively you have to engage with material. And to engage you have to care. Do you have a project in your mind that youd like to build? Good. Every time you learn something new try to apply that knowledge to build a small part of your project. It may be riddled with bugs it might not work and that is OK. I can barely remember the time when I wrote a great piece of software from the first iteration. Dont skip problem sets!

As products are added to the inventory the products are scanned by a barcode reader.This adds the inventory to a database.As products are removed from the inventory the products are scanned again this time removing them from the database.As long as this process is followed the database will show the current stock level at any time.If your company is more complicated than a simple INOUT warehouse then you can obviously scan the items as they move through the facility. You can tailor the scanners to change the properties of each item in the dataabse as they are scanned so that you know exactly where each item is or other parameters like  items in stock of which  are in for repair  repaired and awaiting restock  sold awaiting packaging  on shelves etc etc. All you need to do is change what happens when the item is scanned.The added bonus is that you dont need to buy any RFID chips or whatever you can print unique barcode stickers on any computer,learnprogramming,dghlrtv,2,t5_2r7yd

The best resource Ive every come across for learning to think creatively is the book A Mind For Numbers.If I where to break down the process of learning programming by the advice given I would say this Focus and learn syntax but give yourself breaks and revisit what you are having a difficult time learning. There is a fundamental difference between memorizing ideas and internalizing said ideas and using them creatively. The focused mind is needed for memorizing but is limited and uncreative. The diffuse mind is needed to internalize and creatively use these ideas but processes things in the background. Rest and periodic breaks are needed to allow the diffuse mind to process and give us deep understanding.,learnprogramming,dgio010,1,t5_2r7yd
