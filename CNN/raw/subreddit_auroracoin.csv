445638,0,t3_1x89pe,I tried to do this and build the module. I followed the guide here but it isnt working. I used the special mingw for python so the module was installed correctly. Here is an image of the error could you tell me what has gone wrong? Strange ive done this before for dogecoin and it worked.,auroracoin,cfqyepe,1,t5_304xv

473091,0,t1_cfu10db,Yep my understanding is that you still need to ident all people with passport or similar ID. How would that even be done on such scale?,auroracoin,cfu1k5w,1,t5_304xv

479089,0,t3_1zl4sq,There is no research to be done on this coin right now at this price.  You are gambling with something that long term is going lower so you better be a very good trader or very lucky.,auroracoin,cfuq4l3,5,t5_304xv
492920,0,t1_cfw7rub,Unless the air drop was a red herring and what hes really been selling is the undisclosed premineCheck out where all of those coins come from... they were ALL mined prior to the release of auroracoin.,auroracoin,cfware9,3,t5_304xv
493611,0,t1_cfvzqii,First thing that will happen the instant the airdrop hits which I doubt it will is a mass dumb of . AUR by thousands of people the developer knows this so he will cash out and kill the coin rather than let all of Iceland do it for him.,auroracoin,cfwdlha,1,t5_304xv
518235,0,t1_cfysbdm,Dont worry about doge. There is simply being mined too many for now. After some halvings it will stabilize.,auroracoin,cfz6dym,1,t5_304xv

573726,0,t3_20ooq3,too bad there are so many panic sellers.. price goes up a little and they start selling like crazy but i guess thats the way its supposed to be.. at least its good for those who want to buy at low prices ,auroracoin,cg5hk3u,0,t5_304xv
618780,0,t1_cgalgv1,And if your demands are not met then it was a scam and you want to be told you were right?There is really no shortage of hate in the cryptocurrency community but I guess thats true of the internet in general.,auroracoin,cgaltxf,4,t5_304xv

646712,0,t1_cgdqxlv,Ive never gotten the whole anonymity complex. Why hide who you are? I use my real name everywhere. The way I see it if you dont want what you say to be associated with you its probably better left unsaid.,auroracoin,cgds51w,3,t5_304xv
648885,0,t1_cgdwn0f,Youve got a point in some situations it can be useful. However those are extreme cases. Im more thinking about the typical person not the whistleblowers sex crime victims or revolutionaries hiding from oppressive government agencies. Not a lot of that happening in Iceland...Most of my experience with anonymous speakers is online where typical people tend to just use it to throw insults and spread false info without risk of it being tied back to them. Thats pretty much what my comment was aimed at.  Of course I know there are also exceptional cases online but those are few and far between in comparison.gt just because you cannot understand it doesnt devalue its use.Overall no but if people dont understand its value of course its not going to look very valuable to them.,auroracoin,cge114k,1,t5_304xv
662829,0,t1_cgemexk,If you cant see the value in anonymous free speech its a stones throw away from censorship arguments. People need to understand that free speech is often attacked in stages with anonymous or unpopular free speech being the first goal since its the hardest to justify. There is an idiot online crowd there will always be an idiot crowd in one form or another. Im not classing you as the enemy of free speech but I AM trying to explain to you why your casual remarks ofgtThe way I see it if you dont want what you say to be associated with you its probably better left unsaid.are so poorly examined and inherently flawed. Again Im not attacking you Im attacking your statements. ,auroracoin,cgfm368,1,t5_304xv
691743,0,t3_22316t,Seems like a good idea in general Im not sure specifically what to ask of them though.I think most of the airdrop recipients are probably looking to either keep their money in AUR or cash out entirely hopefully many more of the former which means theyd probably just go through bitcoin.  This hurts AUR but doesnt really help or hurt bitcoin since its bought on one side and sold on the other.So I dont really think selling them for each other is necessarily the solution.If theres a way they could try to promote and spread the word for each other that would probably be good.  The shibes are generally a helpful and positive bunch theres a good chance theyd be willing to help if its something the strength of the community can be used for rather than something that involves a lot of money moving around.Unfortunately cant think of any brilliant ideas at this time.On another note markets acting weird today someone might have been trying to force the price down  we were approaching price levels when people thought the coin was dead . shot quickly back up to . now though.  Rough day for many cryptocurrency prices today maybe its a sale.,auroracoin,cgiwiu1,3,t5_304xv
