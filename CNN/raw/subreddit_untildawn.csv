I was very much on the fence about hiding with Jess and Matt in the mines and knew immediately that I should have because of how much she was limping along.

I live in Alberta and have had my native relatives speak of the wendigo like one would tease a kid about the boogeyman. I was really stoked to see the game set in my neck of the woods using legends from my childhood. Definitely enhanced my experience especially since I fell for every little twist and didnt see the Wendigo reveal coming. I was thinking ghost or something after Joshs reveal. Also Emily is a bitch.

It doesnt matter what you say in the saw scene she will think you chose to save her regardless because the saw will always go to Josh. However if you verbalize that you want to save Josh then it pays off at the point where Chris amp Mike have Josh tied up.

5015124,0,t1_cuq5nzd,Hayden P. was clearly their big ticket actor and they seemed to work harder on her character than the others too. She seems to be the most realistic looking her facial expressions the most detailed or most accurately captured. The other characters looked amazing but I noticed that Sam always seemed to look much more real than they did.They did everything they could to make Sam the perfect one. She was the smart one the nice one the sympathetic one the one who supported Josh after his sisters disappeared the one who was against the prank in the first place etc.Plus its hard not to be biased towards characters that are played by actors you like. A lot of people like Hayden so shes going to be peoples favourite just because she looks and sounds like her.I am guilty of this too.

Its assumed to be on the entire time because of something in the game that relies on it being on but I guess they just prefer not to turn it on.,untildawn,cyehjbs,2,t5_2xlrw
6206953,0,t3_406fje,Nope completely caught me off guard. I didnt know the flamethrower man the stranger was good from the beginning because I didnt even know there was a flamethrower man. I knew nothing about this game going into it. I didnt even know it existed before a friend asked me if I wanted to play. I assumed the stranger wasnt actually trying to help Hannah when he reached for her at the cliff. With the wendigo vision and the fire I figured there was some kind of supernatural element. A firebreathing beast or something.By the time the wendigo was revealed Id forgotten that Id ever thought something supernatural was going on. I was too focused on the psycho. I thought the way they obfuscated the truth and revealed there were multiple antagonists was brilliant. After seeing the clowncostume psycho and the stranger separately we thought there were two people working together to torment the group. It didnt occur to me that the psycho was anyone in the group nor that the stranger was actually trying to help. Maybe because I went into the game totally blind and had no time to form theories before playing it. The first real wendigo reveal was a complete whoa what the fuck! moment for me. It was great.The only thing I figured out before its reveal was that Hannah had cannibalized Beth but that one was pretty obvious.I didnt even actually play the first time we ran through it. I just sat there for  or so hours on the edge of my seat. Im not even a horror fan and Until Dawn was still one of the best gaming experiences Ive ever had.,untildawn,cyv5x27,8,t5_2xlrw
