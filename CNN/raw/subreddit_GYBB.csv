531622,0,t1_cg0aa9x,Theres a small difference between being ineffective with a sniper and being effective. Its all in the small details.One of the main things is know the map. When youre aiming relate what youre seeing through the scope to what you see on the minimap. Identify the roads the junctions crossroads etc and then find them on the mini map. That way youll know exactly where your target is. Its easy to pop up and look for your target only to realize hes actually standing at the next road up. Then its too late. Once you start practicing that youll realize how useful it is.Next point is be patient. This is especially important if youre in a sniper v sniper situation. Check your map if his blip is facing in your direction hes aiming at you waiting for you to pop out. Just wait. As soon as his blip moves back to cover or starts running you start aiming. Thats your window and now you have the upper hand. If you get the shot take it but if not again be patient and wait for him to break cover this time then take the shot.For moving targets such as players running dont follow them with your scope. Try to predict their run and aim ahead of them then take the shot as they come across you. Takes a little bit of practice to know when to pull the trigger.If you have a sniper in your crosshairs and they have you in theirs if they get the first shot off and hit you get back in cover. Theres no guarantee that your round will kill them and theyre already reloading by the time youve shot so theyll get their second shot off before you get yours off.Theres all sorts of tiny details that really add up but practicing them will make a big difference. ,GYBB,cg0pao9,3,t5_2z55o
