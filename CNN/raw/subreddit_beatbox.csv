121120,0,t3_1vf488,If its more like a class like youre implying you should break it up into segments. Have them start with really basic kicks snares hihats etc. and by the end of the year have them be able to to everything throat bass various sfx and all that jazz. You could split them up into small groups and have them learn from each other too.  people experimenting and bouncing ideas off of each other theyll progress pretty quickly and make it easier on you as theyll learn on their own.Choreographing a group beatbox would be really insane if you could elevate them all to an adequate level and do that Id love to see it.,beatbox,ces81jg,-1,t5_2qxj7
374493,0,t3_1ydnim,Pretty good. You have a decent flow. I cant really say anything about your sound quality considering the audio quality itself wasnt very good. Overall it was ok. I would considering working on getting the throat bass a little deeper since it was a big part of your routine. Also how long have you been beatboxing?,beatbox,cfjkxq3,2,t5_2qxj7

1329908,0,t1_cij6rty,Okay . So when I first started doing beatbox I was doing throat bass the wrong way. I was actually just hurting myself by raking my throat bad idea. When I discovered the didgeridoo throat bass it was soo much more comfortable and louder. Basically the reepsone bass is like a really deep vibrato of the didgeridoo one just before it starts to rake. Its not as loud and you lose air a lot faster seen as you puff large amounts of air. Find the vibration a lot lower in the throat completely relax  and round up everything. ,beatbox,cij8cxi,2,t5_2qxj7

1830319,0,t1_ck9oljk,Mine is similar Not every sound that is physically possible sounds good and should be in a routine. Probably because I have been in beatboxing for  years but I prefer really well practised clean drum sounds over some weird speed farting. But I guess since beatboxing has grown so much it has become very competitive and you have to be different and always do something new..,beatbox,ck9qvop,3,t5_2qxj7

3186763,0,t1_cor1dun,Well the title threw me off a bit...Biggest thing I think you should work on is tightening up your sounds. Theyre just a bit sloppy. Also Id suggest a new snare at the very least. I think what youre doing is considered a rimshot which is what I used for a long time before I started working on this very same thing.

4723299,0,t1_ctpj1vl,Yeah what Im thinking is it samples what is coming through the mic at one hand position and extends the delay length volume decay with others. Seems like they adopted the idea Imogen Heap has already been working on with her gloves project. ,beatbox,ctpwtmx,2,t5_2qxj7

6427494,0,t3_43qjnl,How long have you been at it?Learn to control it by trying some exercises.  doing it as quiet as you can without losing the bass.  as little breathe as possible.  Vary how you tilt your head. I dont get the mechanics of why this helps but a lot of Beatboxers tilt their heads when doing TB. ,beatbox,czk52ni,1,t5_2qxj7

9296096,0,t3_57rl2j,You need to go to system settings and select multi for input and output fx. Just look for the option and change it from single to multi. Save the bank so it stays on and youre good to go. ,beatbox,d8uchv7,1,t5_2qxj7
9507208,0,t3_5azmtn,Sounds like inward throat bass tho more like vocalization. Its really tight and sounds like you recently discovered it. Not a knock. Sounds cool. The switch to inward bass is just opening up your throat all the way.  ,beatbox,d9kysej,3,t5_2qxj7

10053480,0,t3_5jnwof,Im just sad that Bloomer sorta threw his round with Komodo. While I do not deny that Komodo did really good in all his battles it just seemed that Bloomer may have underestimated his own opponent. Bloomer mightve easily beasted his way through the finals if not for that one battle. ,beatbox,dbhzrsf,5,t5_2qxj7
