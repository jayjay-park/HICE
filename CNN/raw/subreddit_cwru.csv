Before Google Apps you were forced to forward the address to some other provider but now you get a Google Apps account forever which realistically means for as long as they can afford it. If you are using any alias addresses though those are not guaranteed.,cwru,cf0wqx0,3,t5_2ryfo

5420253,0,t3_3p9n4w,Case dumps money on its students like crazy. If youre worried about the cost apply anyway. Its a free app after all. Something like  of students get money from the school. If you threw a pen in a room of case students theres no way it wouldnt hit somebody getting MINIMUM k off a year. Case is VERY generous with scholarships especially compared to other private schools. Depending on your GPA SAT scores activities common amounts range anywhere between kk. But thats not the end. You will graduate in  years here unless you choose not to. If you are unable to get a major requirement class they will override you inno worries about getting classes. Plusespecially since you are considering engineeringthere are tons of coops and internships availablei hear basically whoever applies gets it. The average pay for coops if Im not wrong is around .k a monthif you save wisely thats money that could help lower your final cost of attendance.All of the above factors made case MUCH cheaper than a state public school for me. PM me if you have more questions,cwru,cw4htgy,13,t5_2ryfo

8547026,0,t3_4wtz5t,Looks like a pretty good schedule to me junior going for a mechanical engineering BSMS. The ENGR  recitation was pseudooptional when I took it but that may be different now. You had to show up to turn in homework but that was it unless you wanted to stay and get help from a TA. First Year Seminars arent bad at all just try to have fun with it. Other than those things just stay on top of the class material and it should be smooth sailing for you.,cwru,d69y7ba,8,t5_2ryfo

10226402,0,t1_dc37ngi,We have a program called sages and theres a sages writing resource center. Students who excel at writing serve as the people who read over papers and give feedback and minor corrections. Case is a very academic school people here know how to write a paper and how to correct it. Its like you said these tutors mostly serve as an extra pair of eyes. By no means is it fair to assume that we dont know how to do it ourselves. Our school wants is to excel and be competitive in our fields sorry if you didnt get that experience in college. ,cwru,dc37xdm,4,t5_2ryfo
