3580205,0,t1_cpzoxsu,Im pretty sure that whenever you see flames coming out the end the afterburner is on. The afterburning chamber is just heating up during the first run. You can see the stainless steel start to discolor at the end of the first run and it expands as the flame comes back.. ,engineteststands,cq0de2o,2,t5_2vf91
3914081,0,t1_cr26hiw,Yeah every now and then they launch it on a balloon from Hawaii I think and boost it using a STAR solid booster.,engineteststands,cr2fuzc,2,t5_2vf91
5051780,1,t3_3k58lt,This has nothing to do with Boeing. This is Rolls Royce testing at their own test facility located in Stennis.For reference ,engineteststands,cuuxiyd,0,t5_2vf91
6132890,0,t3_3zgof3,What is an Aerojet workhorse engine. My Googlefu is weak today.,engineteststands,cymquat,2,t5_2vf91
7801641,0,t1_d3slug4,Yeah looks like a hush house with the exhaust pointed in the back. My question is how are they securing the aircraft? I dont see an arresting hook secured to the ground. Are those megachocks it?!,engineteststands,d3syr5y,2,t5_2vf91
8056888,0,t3_4ph811,WTF is that structure on the right and WTF do they put in it that moves such a high volume of air that they felt the need to curve the intake?o.o  gt.lt  O.O,engineteststands,d4lo4wn,7,t5_2vf91
8432227,0,t1_d5vkft1,It is ignited with a laser because on the flight article the throat diameter is about .mm. We cant eject an igniter through that reliably. Yes its an end burner. Yes its planned to fly in an autonomous drone for the air force.,engineteststands,d5vkhst,1,t5_2vf91
8732093,0,t1_d6x5785,Ah gotcha. That makes more sense.  Im still learning this in school but that means the prowler engine has a bypass ratio of  whereas the raptor engine does not correct?,engineteststands,d6x5osq,2,t5_2vf91
9302791,0,t1_d8v4hno,It makes sense when integrated into a hybrid. What prevents it from going mainstream?,engineteststands,d8v72oz,4,t5_2vf91
9304141,0,t3_57udi6,Oh god I am so stiff right now.Heres a  stage with more bonerific audio.,engineteststands,d8vd8bo,1,t5_2vf91
9525124,0,t1_d9n5kwk,Yeah I figured out the structural one that made sense. It makes sense that all F stands are close together. Is the test stand to the southsoutheast obviously not pictured the merlin stand?,engineteststands,d9n68p7,1,t5_2vf91
