4179125,0,t1_crwlyvq,Yeah thats a great example. We need to focus less about our sins and more about loving God because only by loving God and growing closer to him can we cease from our sin. Basically focusing on saying Dont eat the cookie dont eat the cookie is not helpful we should instead be asking God for the grace to become like him I guess.Ive heard that quote by Williamson a few times before and its never really clicked with me. Now I guess I know that we are not called to just cease from sin and be a good guy Catholic but we are called to be saints. Only by striving after Christ with our heart mind body and soul can we truly live out his commands.,CatechismStudyGroup,crwmig6,2,t5_38fzk
