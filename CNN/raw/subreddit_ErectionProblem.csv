4310731,0,t3_3ad9ph,If the doctors say that its psychological then my advice to you would be to see a therapist. A therapist will take you seriously and will help you figure out what it is thats causing you to not get an erection. Since its not physical the solution is within yourself. Just be honest with the therapist and they will be able to help you. ,ErectionProblem,csbjnsi,1,t5_38kps
