For example if youre trying to keep up with school work that you really dont want to do and you say fuck it your probably going to fail at some point. When used in a better manner like if you said fuck it and just went for something is good but you where just scared to do it could change your life for the better  Im not sure if this part will make sense but people always try to blame objects or feelings for the way things turn out.

2091114,0,t3_2itv0o,Trying to become God is what makes us dissatisfied the constant hunger for more and better is what makes us suffer. Deep contentment and peace grows out of the realisation that all the things including ourselves are fundamental aspects God limited in spacetime. Theres no separate God at the end of the journey God is the journey Atman is Brahman all is Tao we too are the journey. God is the moving rope we are the ever unfolding knots and bumps on the rope. We are in God and God is in us.A cup is useful because it is surrounded by noncupness air. The apparent emptiness inside the cup is what makes it more useful than a simple brick God is the emptiness and the cup and the emptiness is the environment of the cup. In much the same way we are each a cup and we are part of the emptiness of others. A tree is the yin to my yang I am the yin to the yang of the tree God is the yin and the yang and its all moving changing unfolding.

If our perception were so different on the sensual level comunication would be impossible. Its never the object in itself that changes but the interpretation we give our relation to the stuff rather than the stuff in itself. Red is red how we interpret this is the point. Not the imagery solely but what is there to red? For some red sucks others love it women use it in their lips and so do thr artists. ,StonerPhilosophy,dcdsotv,1,t5_2s5se

11600628,0,t3_65gh8i,Generally speaking more cultures over history have less of an individualistic priority than what we have in the western world USA. That has evolved over the thousands of years of cultural evolution and probably stems from our need to live socially and communally. While we are seeing a spread of hyperindividualism this could be just a reaction to technology working on all our distinct cultures. The trends we see in the younger generations of choosing ones own lifestyle based on individual tastes rise of isolationism and also rise of trending communal groups like cosplay is just the pendulum swinging to its end. I believe that pendulum will return to a less individualistic slant and more toward our seemingly universal community focused culture where the group is more important than the individuals.    So what does that mean for the future perhaps cultures based more on what ones purpose in life career eg. farming or science or where one lives.. altitude culture island culture flat grassland culture where attributes of the culture support efficient lifestyles within those frameworks. Like we already have now in the USA a schism between the inlanders and the coastal and metropolitan centers the place where you live and grow up shapes your priorities. The other thing locality does is provide you with a unique set of lived experiences like northern latitude lifestyles just by the nature of the weather look much different from southern latitude lifestyles. switch for southern hemisphere. In the same regard what we do effects how we see the world. Engineering culture is global and so is sales just slightly flavored by the country it is in. In  years instead of being labeled Mexican or Chinese or Swedish... one will be labeled Highlander scientist or Islander Farmer... My label would be Traveler Anthropologist.  ,StonerPhilosophy,dgaxupy,1,t5_2s5se
