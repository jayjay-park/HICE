4869943,0,t3_3gwb2c,Well this comment will likely be most unhelpful especially considering the wealth of info amp ideas from everyone else buuut If I happen to be reading the Bible amp someone hands me a pamphletcardpaperpicture  of the time I am going to place it in my Bible without any attention paid to where not in a specific book I mean. Did he maybe attend a nearby church once during his stay or happen across someone who gave him the pamphlet? Then again I have found religious tracts in a variety of places including public bathrooms amp in grocery carts. It very well could have just been there in the room amp he may not have read it or maybe was just reading at random that is with no particular passages in mind. If it were his personal Bible it would have a name at the very least in the cover. As far as the toothbrush location goes I do NOT keep my toothbrush in a bathroom its kind of disgusting think about what happens when you flush all those little particles becoming airborne settling on your things your toothbrush! AGH! I think that maybe dumping the change in the drawer was possibly just habit. Anyways we want the room to be the message I get that but this man committed suicide that indicates that he wasnt sound of mind. There is a good chance that the way things are arranged are meaningless. ,lylestevik,cu8e6dt,2,t5_37qau

5001896,0,t1_cuotvqt,Haha thank you! You should have seen me trying to get a good angle. I spent an hour outside squatting in the garden trying to get it right. It was hot out!! Very undignified but happy to do my duty ,lylestevik,cuowzte,2,t5_37qau

5995006,0,t1_cud509f,Sorry Im not that great with Reddit. Thanks he did the same to Colleen Fitzpatrick unless thats who youre talking about. Another gal was helping him with family tree DNA. She ended up getting the match. BK amp I were friends amp emailed. He helped me with adding high calorie foods to a blender when my hub had tonsil cancer had a feeding tube. I never asked him any BK questions. With him blocking me its my thought that he did remember at some point. Probably when he cut Colleen out. People have told me the he thought there may be piles of money to be made but I didnt feel that way. ,lylestevik,cy5h593,1,t5_37qau

6317399,0,t1_cz7c5jl,Yeah I took it down bc the guy is alive and well and has a family so I wanted to keep his privacy. However if you go to the  Hoquiam yearbook and look under voted best eyes its on or about page  its in the first  pages for sure you can find the person  It really did look like Lyle especially when i did the side by side photos.,lylestevik,cz7puip,2,t5_37qau
6450928,0,t1_czm79fa,Reading more about isotope testing I think this was likely a hair analysis.  That would reflect months not years unfortunately so I dont think it gives us a clue on where he was raised or lived for a long period of time.  Im thinking that if they could do a dental test however that would definitely help us pinpoint it.,lylestevik,czmkf9r,3,t5_37qau

6584611,0,t3_45trsi,I agree with letting them choose the picture because theyd know best.Do you think they could also look at autopsy pictures and make an updated clearer version of what he wouldve looked like? Im sure people would donate that as well. I feel that the one Grateful Doe had the updated one that almost looked like an actual photo really helped.,lylestevik,d00eimd,6,t5_37qau
6768721,0,t1_d0jhv7t,The shoes are interesting actually. Wearing outdoor shoes in his room would def make it less likely that he is Middle Eastern. ,lylestevik,d0jijss,5,t5_37qau

6863701,0,t1_d0ua9km,Interesting.  I read that if you are banished from the Gypsy community they will not give you a funeral. You are basically on your own.  Although sometimes the banishment is temporary.  I just read the Amish have something called meidung or shunning.  You are basically excommunicated but you can be taken back if you repent before the community.  Lyle wore no jewelry and had not tattoos.   Lyle has a chin and ears no earlobes similar to Bianca Balti who is an Italian model.  The boxlike facial structure is also similar.  ,lylestevik,d0ub6zt,3,t5_37qau
7079643,0,t1_d10xggl,The use of towel is propably because he wanted a soft suffocation without the horrible feeling of getting hanged. The way he used the towel blocked arteries stopping blood flow and thus gaining oxygen without the need to squeeze windpipe.  Ive been suspecting he learned this method either from the internet or from someone me and my undercover theory...,lylestevik,d1iuc5o,3,t5_37qau

8221093,0,t1_d555dmd,I know that common convention is to wear watches on the nondominant hand.  But I also know lefties who ignore that and wear them on the left anyway.  However a tan line might have been visible on one wrist or the other if he had been in the habit of wearing a watch until shortly before his death.How he cinched his belt around his neck might offer some measure of reinforcing or contradicting the lefthanded notion.Also suggestive would be which hand deposited the most fingerprints on working mechanisms in his rooms like doorknobs AC control knobs TV remote coffeemaker the lone Pepsi cup etc.Edit typo repair amp completing incomplete thought.,lylestevik,d556ygh,2,t5_37qau

8947894,0,t1_d7jrqli,But he didnt ask right away to switch rooms. There was an interim. He took a shower first and lay down for a bit. If Lyle showed up with the intention of committing suicide he wouldnt have taken a shower. He would have inspected the room found it not suitable and would have walked back to the store where the clerk was and asked to switch rooms. From the beginning of looking at the case I feel like theres a strong possibility he arrived at the conclusion to commit suicide when he was in the shower. Or that it became a possibility during that time in that first room and then he requested a new room and spent the rest of the weekend getting to the conclusion. Under this scenario the reason for moving could have been because there was someone next door. We know he was concerned about being heard because of the pillows on the side of the rack he hanged himself on. The first room he was in Room  was adjacent to Room . In the investigation photos taken on Monday  the drapes in room  are open. Cant be sure if there was someone there on  because doesnt seem like there were many external shots taken. But the deciding factor that Lyle might have used to switch rooms could have been whether there was someone next door. From Room  he could have just looked at the other rooms to see if there was someone occupying a room by looking at the blinds and curtains or by looking to see if there was a car parked in front of the other rooms. I cant remember but there was some mention that by Sunday Lyle was the only one in the hotel. But never really got a word on occupancy of other people in the motel.,lylestevik,d7nekr6,2,t5_37qau

9838763,0,t1_dapyq7z,Uhhh maybe? Theres really no reason to think so apart from wishful thinking that this guy is Lyle. The noses literally dont remotely resemble the same shape. Plus Lyles lips are much fuller Marcus barely has a top lip and theres no way swelling would account for all of Lyles lips evenly spaced volume on the bottom and top.Additionally Lyle has a much higher arch to his eyebrows and its unlikely he was plucking them as he had a unibrow.,lylestevik,daq0i8z,3,t5_37qau

9893983,0,t1_dajw7ki,I agree. His WPassigned identity would have been in the system to match his fingerprints. Im pretty sure the US Marshals would have IDd him as in the WP alias and collected his remains. He wouldnt be recorded as a Doe. They probably dont make it common knowledge when anyone living or dead is in witness protection but I dont really see a reason for them to try to hide a suicide. But anythings possible!,lylestevik,dax7jr6,2,t5_37qau
