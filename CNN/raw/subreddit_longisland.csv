1284101,0,t3_28rgat,We had an anniversary party at Press in Rockville centre. You need  people to book the back room if you have less it just means they might put a table or two in there if the main area is overcrowded.I did a lot of price comparisons when looking for a place and everyone else I looked at offered a bare bones two choice party menu. Once you started adding drinks and other extras it got to be a fortune. Press makes really good pressed sandwiches with hand cut fries. The menu is unique and delicious if a little casual and they let us choose  items off the menu to offer so we had something to please everyone no matter their need. We had appetizers main courses dessert and pitchers of wine sangria and soda and it was less money than other places wanted for much less.We ate there first to try the food and I highly recommend it. Be sure you order the Nutella and banana press for dessert its heaven. Even if you dont have your party there youll have a great meal. my fave is the meatball sandwich and my husband loved the sandwiches made on knishes instead of bread.,longisland,cie2tf3,1,t5_2qk64

But I have two adult dogs  yo each from shelters who are loving and gentle.Work with the shelter to find out if you can foster for a few weeks before adopting this gives you a chance to evaluate the dog and how heshe fits into your family.  You might find that an otherwise wellbehaved dog becomes destructive because you dont have enough time to play with or exercise them.  If youve never owned a dog before it would be a good idea to work with a trainer.Dogs have personality just like people.  Puppies can have bad attitudes too it depends a lot on environment and how theyre raised but sometimes even that is not enough.,longisland,cpgtmse,10,t5_2qk64

They have very clean procedures dont reusemix needles and the atmosphere is relaxed. They prefer to do everything thoroughly. By that I mean they sit down with you and go over every detail make sure youre comfortable and make sure that the tattoo you create with them is exactly what you want and where youll want it. Theyll work with you if youve got an odd schedule and they will never push you through a session. If they feel youre becoming ill or uncomfortable theyll stop for the day and you can set up another appointment. Here nothing is pressured or rushed. They take their time and truly love what they do.

Or you can join the SBPOA for year and utilize the steps at West Beach and kayak rack for your dinghy. The membership includes other perks too and worth it in my opinion. Youll also meet the best locals at West Beach.Rocky Point Trails are great for hikingmountain bikinghorseback ridinghuntingfalconryetc. There are many access points with parking.There are also public hiking trails right in Sound Beach North of Lower Rocky Point Rd.Mesquite on Echo Ave has the best CaliTexMex food around. You can bring a beer or two to drink at the counter while you wait for your order. Branchinellis next to Stop and Shop and Rocky Point Pizza are tied for best pizza. Sabai Thai is not too bad if you ask them to make it somewhat authentic. Best sushi used to be Bentens but I like Wasabi now that they moved in. Crazy Beans coffee house is great for coffeebreakfast.

4543990,0,t3_3d96wa,Ive done a lot of apartment hunting in the last year too many life changes and Ive learned a few things when it comes to recognizing scams.. Theyre usually related to specific areas the ones I see most often are listed in Babylon and Long Beach.. The photos ALWAYS show furnished apartments.. The ads are very long and give a ton of detail.. Theyre always pet friendly. Sometimes laundry is onsite. Generally speaking there are very few real apartments that are pet friendly and practically none of them offer a washer and dryer.. Legit apartments either wont have any photos or will have photos that are unfurnished also the photos are usually kind of low quality. . Scams usually have weird email addresses the most recent one I saw I think was for outlook or something not the standard craigslist ones.Its the summertime so scams are especially present right now. Its really really frustrating especially because theyre usually the only things in my price range. Good luck in your search.,longisland,ct3eagm,3,t5_2qk64

5000566,0,t3_3jarcg,Hey there just saw this post and thought id provide my two cents.  My significant other has suffered from depression and anxiety due to a variety of factors including family issues and life issues among others and Id argue more anxiety than anything else.  Im not talking about depressed as its come to mean with people throwing around the word just because they didnt get what they wanted.  Im talking about clinically depressed and anxious needing medications having had suicidal thoughts having emotional despair frequently fights frequently etc.  My s.o. made it through undergrad and graduated with a double major at a top state school got into and graduated medical school not top pick but a decent program and landed a residency position again not top pick but not crap either.  Additionally my s.o. is still friends with the friends that matter.  It may not be tons and tons of friends but the small group of friends that matter will be there for you.With that said every step of the way has been a HUGE challenge and challenging as hell with the last step of our journey involving having to move halfway across the country to a place thats arguably one of the crappier parts of the nation and where we know nobody.  The point of this story is that despite how bad your anxiety may be there is ALWAYS hope.  But its crucial you have someone that is there for you either a s.o. or someone else because it will be hard but not impossible.  If your friend is suffering from anxiety medicallyspeaking get help as soon as possiblethe longer they delay the worse it can get.Conversely if your friend is anxiousnervous in a nonmedical sense it may just be a case of needing to get out of their shell.  I dont have depression or anxiety but Ive always been a nervous person not good at making friends etc and I still am despite being out of undergrad for several years now.  Sometimes you just need to be open to looking like an idiot or feeling awkward because a lot of getting to know other people involves that.  Your brain will constantly keep putting thoughts in your head like what if soandso thinks this or what if I look like this or what if soandso thinks im a loser etc.  Ignore your brain.  There will be people who think crap about you and its just a fact of life.  Just be confident in yourself and be genuine.  Sit next to someone in class who is also sitting alonetheres a VERY good chance theyre just as nervous as you and a very good chance they may be looking to make friends as well.  Also take everything you see on facebook with a grain of saltpeople like to make their lives appear more amazing than they actually are on there.  Dont fall into the trap of seeing shit on there and thinking I wish my life was like theirs or I wish I had so many friends etc. Also dont join one of those party fraternitiessorrorities where people pay massive dues to make friends...that shit is stupid.,longisland,cuor7ow,2,t5_2qk64

5999194,0,t3_3xcz6b,Ive been using FIOS internet and voice for several years.  The internet speed has always been reliable  no issues with Netflix Youtube or anything else.  The phone quality is also really good.  The only downsides are that you have to renegotiate your rate every couple years because they rape you when the discounts expire.  I think Optimum does the same thing but Im not sure how bad they are.  You basically have to tell them youre cancelling your service and then they will negotiate.  Also they give you a battery in case of power failure which will die on its own after a couple of years and they expect you to pay to replace it... I decided to disable the battery failure alarm and go without battery backup.  Overall Im happy with Verizon and I definitely recommend them.  ,longisland,cy60wpf,3,t5_2qk64

Long Island sound is protected water.  Ships tugs and barges can and do seek shelter from open ocean weather.  Historically it was a great sanctuary for shipping except for the pirate problem but it is not very deep.  Out near the opening near Montauk it can be a  feet deep in some places its  but most places its only  feet deep or less thats the depth required by modern shipping.  Take it as given that naturally high places get worn down and low places get filled in and it clarifies that by filling in LIS with dredging spoils we are moving in the wrong direction.

Tuesday night open mics are usually more adult.  The ambiance isnt the best but they are in front of a bank so there isnt much they can do.
