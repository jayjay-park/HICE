363589,0,t1_cfifzjk, How about we say  IQ relative to todays Now I would have to argue your point that intelligence ! successful societies. We can simply compare the average country today to a country ruled by people with relative IQs of . Obviously one would do better than the other.With that in mind what do you think about race in this scenario? What Im really looking for is a separate reason to want to defend ones own race and personal genetic legacy.,HBD,cfig9qc,3,t5_2rh4f

619456,0,t1_cgad901,All Vice says is they are doing intensive and extensive research. And investing in education. Nothing more. Im here to calm down the genetic determinism enthusiasm of some cause its a rather slippery ground. Dont intend to school anyone. Your last paragraph is perfectly fine with me. Thats what is called bio diversity and comes as result of epigenetic impact not major genetic differences.,HBD,cgaolie,0,t5_2rh4f

7791437,0,t3_4lzjd0,It will be interesting when they decode the genome of some of these different species amp subspecies.  Two very similar species hits home with me and I feed both...the Allen vs the Rufous hummingbird.  They are very similar and sometimes you have to measure a back tail feather for identification but they have noted different temperaments and the Rufous is much more aggressive.  I would suspect when they are decoded there will be less of a variation between their genome than between human populations yet they are labeled two different species and have noted personality differences.   Time will tell though.      ,HBD,d3rtc9p,1,t5_2rh4f
7916835,0,t3_4noew8,I believe here is the link to the nature study.   The politically correct interpretation the journalists implied was sort of humorous. I think the conclusion is what I grabbed here from the study...this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution whereas many important risk factors for lateonset complex diseases may not have been.Not sure though... I confess Im not smart enough and studious enough to decipher all of that.  ,HBD,d45xdv8,2,t5_2rh4f

8309252,0,t1_d5fsah0,What youre saying is complete nonsense and stop equating aryan race with blond hair and blue eyes. Those are minor but significant racial traits. That is all. Not every blond person is of aryan race. Second of all there is A TON of evidence that the white race or whatever you want to call it was much more widespread in the ancient times  as far back as China actually. The planet and the areas surrounding Europe such as North Africa and the Middle East were lot whiter in the ancient times. That is also a fact. We also know through genetic testing that many civilizations were foundedheaded by groups most genetically similar to modern Europeans. Take India for example Scientists Find Link Between Indian Caste Rank And Genetic Similarity To Europeans    Its the same with many other former civilizations Greece Egypt etc... Where do you think this came from?  This isnt indigenous to Pakistan. This was migration from the North.,HBD,d5g7okl,1,t5_2rh4f
