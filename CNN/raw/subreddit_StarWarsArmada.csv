Starter Wave  and Imp Aces would be .Both fo these though are for just  of any ship which most people playing will consider required just to have the cards.

It does not cross a hull zone on the defender that is not the defending zone and it does not cross anything that would count as an obstruction.The grey line however shows that that the Frigates starboard side is not within the firing arc of the Vics starboard side so the Vic cant do that attack.Example  The Vic again has line of sight as described above and this time a portion of the Frigates starboard hull zone is within the Vics starboard arc.

Around the Star Destroyer is likely where a lot of the action will be but that also means enemy squadrons or even worse some stray antisquadron shots though I personally would not shoot squadrons unless I have nothing else to shoot. If I know Tycho will die too quickly then I wont send him alone. Tychos main advantage is being able to reach Rhymer without getting engaged. If you have your main force there then thats not a problem to do with my other squadrons. I will be happy to engage your Rhymer ball and keep it engaged for longer. I will also delay the engagement until it would actually be useful to you say right before you would shoot one of my ships. I dont see your point about Xwings doing well against Imperial ships.

A better strategy would be to give the overload pulses to the Raiders and activate the ISD later in the round when it has the potential to use Avenger to its full effect.Edit This rule also is the reason why you cant brace damage from advanced concussion missiles for example.

I tend to find he dies a lot escorting so I switched to either a plain x wing or get two a wing squadrons with the counter attack rolls.Ive found the same thing. As cover for Ywings. Luke is just far too expensive. Save  points get put in a generic Xwing and have enough leftover to add Gunnery Team to a space whale. Commit to Antisquadron with  more points over Lukes cost. A pair of Awings. Better all around at intercepting hostile squadrons than Luke. Speed  with six blue dice between them and Counter. My preference...  Commit to Antiship. Afterall combined x Ywings spit out the same  anti squadron dice as a single Luke but do more antiship dmg AND provide more health and targets for hostile antisquadrons to chew through.Then I apply the same logic to Wedge... and this is how I ended up with  Ywings in my basement. I dont want to think of what Id do to have a Major Rhymer style range upgrade for rebels.Hell I can think of one now...

6110247,0,t1_cyk56qy,I dunno about way longer MCs benefit from being in close range at which point they can only force a reroll with a single dice per attack not exactly game changing. Mon Mothmas biggest benefit is for ships planning on staying within Medium range to allow them to keep the Long Range benefit of Evade Tokens while still being able to use all the Blue Dice. Thus she works amazingly well with CRs who have lots of blue dice and lots of Evades. Id hesitate using her with MCs as when they are at their best she is at her worst. Akbar on the hand turns their side batteries from awesome to super awesome however it also takes front side dice out of the equation and at close range it becomes easier to put an enemy on the sidefront diagonal allowing you to double tap em.  Akbar is best on AF who can sit at great range broadsiding to their metallic hearts content.  Mon Mothma is best on CRs who can zip around staying at Medium range and using both Blue Dice and Evades to maximum efficiency.   For MCs Id say go with Reikan and activate them last forcing your opponent to waste shots on MCs and have them still attack or target other ships leaving the incredible damage MCs alone to shoot again next turn.  Garm Bel Ibis and Dodonna are more situational and benefit more from what upgrades you take rather than what ships you bring.

If you really need the ISD to always go first it means you position it very poorly.As mentioned if you want to keep PO and not get AV. then completely remove the raider and trigger it with your ISD as your first ship. Though the real problem with going ISD activation first is that most of the time you want the glad in prime position to dish out the most damage it can before it can be destroyed. And the ISD is unlikely to be the first to die.While one of your gladiator will be the one blocking most of the time and if you dont make use of it and attack with the ISD most of the time youll activate the ISD first at the cost of unrecoverable damage or destruction of your gladiator. While it will never be able to inflict its total potential which is what the glads are about. The only glad that can really make use of PO is the one with demolisher on its first attack. Trigger PO then use demolisher to move once and attack. But next turn you wont get to do it again because the glad will be a goner if it does not go first.,StarWarsArmada,cys4l3a,2,t5_32ym5

Their faces are located on the opposite side of the dials for their respective model Luke for the Xwings from the core set Howl for the core TIEs but only  of those faces should ever be flipped to the Ace for any given list. Example If youre including Luke in a list with multiple Xwings you pay  points for Luke and  points for any other Xwings. The models dials should will show  Xwing flipped to Lukes face and the rest of the dials would show regular Xwings. In your player area youd have  copy of the Luke Skywalker card and  copy of the Xwing card to keep track of what each unit is capable of.The only reason that theres  faces per dial is to save on the cost of printing extra dials and making it more convenient for players to swap their Aces back to basic squadrons or vice versa.,StarWarsArmada,d0knbpr,7,t5_32ym5

6875150,0,t1_d0vjh1e,Remember something important though  Lets say the TIEIn gets the alpha off in that scenario.  OK good one.  Lets go further the Interceptors successfully elimiinate all the targets in one round of shooting.The Awings throw  dice back for each kill.  Average rolls are one damage per fighter.  Slightly above average rolls are  damage each.The Interceptors have only  hull remaining.  If the Interceptors jumped a smart opponent they have now jumped well into range of the antisquadron defenses on the command ships.  And with only  hull points remaining they are going to immediately be destroyed by a round of antisquadron shooting.I need to point out also that because Jans ability triggers at range  savvy players can hold her at the edge of the range  band and force the Interceptors to either not engage her or to jump beyond the AWings into again the range of the ships.In either case this is a major win for the Rebel player.  Once again they are perfectly defensively synergised to either counter or outright defeat the enemy squadrons.In Armada Defensive synergies by being absolutes are always more effective than offensive synergies.  In the above example the defensive synergy of positioning abilities and point costs reduces the Imperial offense to either a draw or a loss for the Imperials in every engagement on strictly average dice rolls.  Any remaining Imperial forces no longer have squadrons to synergize with so those points are no longer a wise investment.This is one reason the Imperial meta has revolved around three particular squadrons since Wave  being Rhymer the Firespray and Dengar.  These fighters work together better than any other Imperial group simply because they all have defensive capability to withstand punishment.

Set them up so that they are in the path of where the enemy ships will end up so that they have to take a longer range shot from a weaker arc on you and then move into your heavy front arc. Actively chasing down ships with the raider will  of the time end up with your raider blowing up.In regards to avenger and OLP I have found it works best when running a fleet with screed ISD with OLP no gunnery teams and at least  preferably  activations. That way you can set up the double arc for the next round and then shoot side arc screed to prol OLP if needed and then shoot out the front arc to capitalize on avenger.

10900813,0,t1_de49xe0,The optimal decision  of the time would be to pass for both players. You remove strategy by making one option so much better that theres no reason to use any other.A game like Destiny can hedge that by making the round end if both players pass which eventually forces  the first players hand but Armada doesnt have that.In Armada you would almost always pass until allas many as possible of your opponents ships have activated. This both gives you maximum information and forces your opponent to move into range of your guns first. Then if necessary you could activate ships that needed to get a shot off or would otherwise be destroyed.Itd be like giving the player with fewer activations the choice to go first or second every turn an advantage so big that objectives are heavily skewed for that very reason.,StarWarsArmada,de4cave,3,t5_32ym5

There is no longer a need to configure an external URL on the hidden Data sheet. If you downloaded the Rebel BaseOutpost Tracker sheet you can delete it its no longer used.      Changed the way the Fleet Builder handles the selection of upgrades that arent allowed for a ship. Previously you could select an upgrade that isnt allowed for a ship and the text in the cell would change to red and the point cost of this illegal upgrade would be added to your fleet total. Now you can still select an illegal upgrade in gray cells but the spreadsheet will immediately empty the cell and the cost of the upgrade isnt added to your fleet total. This change is a massive hack and you may notice the illegal upgrade shows up for a moment in red and its cost is temporarily added to the fleet total but then the upgrade is cleared and the total fleet cost is restored. To implemented this correctly I would have to rewrite a large majority of the spreadsheet in JavaScript and I dont have the time to do this. The way it works now is fine.

The Dodonnas Pride probably doesnt need anything besides the title.   All those blue dice give you a REALLY good chance already of getting a crit  and the blue dice have NO BLANKS so you pretty much always get a good roll.  GR  Repair Crews is a bad option for this list because your ships have so little hull  by the damage their shields are gone they are likely going to be dead before you can even trigger Repair Crews.   That one tends to work better with larger ships like the big MCs.  Consider moving Sato over to your GR and even Lando also the scatter will really help keep that ship alive.   Toss on a Bright Hope title to make the ship virtually immortal.  Nebulon  do you have a Nebulon expansion yet?   The titles that come with it would really work well here especially Salvation. Salvation combos extremely well with Sato  A single black die can count for THREE damage if its the crit hit side...   MC  thats not bad at all actually.   Combos well with Sato.  Black dice crit effects that can trigger at long range is solid.   Just try not to target ships that have Evades because few things suck as bad as getting that double black cancelled by an evade.  ,StarWarsArmada,dfk1joh,4,t5_32ym5
