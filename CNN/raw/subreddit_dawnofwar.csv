4163553,0,t3_3858m7,Ive been following this mod for a couple years now and its really expanded in this new update. I think my main criticism is that players can get titans too fast and so a lot of middle tier units become useless or just arent built at all. Like look at Tau. There are four different kinds of Crisis Battlesuits with little difference. Compare this to SC where marines are still being built into the lategame. Besides that though the visuals are great and theres a pretty wide faction diversity although some factions are quite similar ID and SM for example.,dawnofwar,cruurpj,1,t5_2s7bq

Its more like CnC style genuine RTS buildings bigger scale maps and unit populations grander endgame units.

7518946,0,t3_4ic450,DOW  had squad sizes near to the tabletop squad sizes for marines this is nearly x bigger than squads in DOW  maxing squads at  marines. For basic comparison the population cap limited you to  squads of basic marines as well as seperate vehicle pop cap. Id imagine that DOW  will go back to DOW  squad sizes but scale the pop caps upwards i hope. Or we could be misinterpreting what they mean by bigger given that new minititan class of vehicles wraithknights imperial knights are making an appearance. Bigger could just mean literally bigger more destructive units.As for last stand I dont honestly know so i wont venture an opinion.

7977342,0,t3_4od4am,Speaking purely for myself I can sum up my expectations as followsThe artstyle and graphics they used in DoW  the style offered the semirealistic view of the carnage in the k universe and how brutal the combat was and was appropriately Grim Dark. I am not a fan of the cartoon like colors as it is such a major departure from the original styles and it being too similar to Starcraft Upping the size of our conflict from the skirmish side to full blown battles perhaps I was nave in expecting this but I was really thinking theyd go somewhat down the route of Total War series Slightly larger than DoW  battles with a lot more emphasis on counters possibility of terrain being usedComposition of Forces although not much is known right know I was expecting the same counter system we already had in place during DoW  a mixture of soft normal hard and veryhard counters to multiple kinds of unittypes. Coupled with perhaps some of the deckbuilding from WargameCommander abilities for support abilities special troops or alterations to standard army composition st company veterans Superheavies Knights you name it.Right now it looks an awful lot like the devs have deciced to go down the Starcraft  route with art style and somewhat of the gameplay.,dawnofwar,d4cq8x7,1,t5_2s7bq

8020295,0,t3_4p2g60,Cool idea. but your thinking small. Space marines dont seem like they would be very relatable.

8372052,0,t3_4u9tbe,The lore is open to interpretation. Of course it is its one of the best things about k is having so many different writers and their own take on the universe. And almost all of it fits into the lore given the length and breadth and variety of the galaxy not to mention that stuff written about the universe is frequently seen through the eyes of someone in universe allowing for things to be twisted and changed from the norm for the sake of artistic licence.However none of this is easy. It takes effort and a deep knowledge of the lore already to make sure that your addition fits in. Its doable certainly but not easy and requires a respect for the lore and universe. The issue people have with stuff is when people who are entrusted with expanding the universe shit on everything that has come before literally the very foundations of the universe. This Terminator armour jump spinny gymnastics crap  goes against absolutely everything established previously. It sets an alarming precedent for the rest of the game to take liberties like that as well.The thing is it serves no purpose. Its seems to be for no reason other than the fact that it looks cool. It doesnt add anything doesnt contribute and actively damages the stuff thats came previously. He would look just as cool matching steadfastly through weapons fire and picking up a tank and ripping it to pieces with power fists. If they wanted to have a marine doing awesome flips and jumps give him a set of Corvus pattern armour a jump pack and some lighting claws and set him loose Raven Guard style. Or perhaps like that Blood Angels Chaplain I forget his name. There are plenty of ways to do what they did and fit it into the lore but they didnt they actively at least it seems to me shat on stuff that came before because they either couldnt be arsed to look at a wiki article or even worse deliberately  ignored it ,dawnofwar,d5o21o1,12,t5_2s7bq

11243116,0,t1_df64bqf,Who are you referring to when you say that all youre going to do is Amove?  We touched upon this a couple of times and I think can elaborate and say that the games overall combat style is pretty much just SC with squads.  The interactions that you have with the units are pretty much the same but I dont think you can have as much precise control as you do in SC because of just how squads are.  Having reached Masters TerranToss in WoLHotS and played a lot of B iCCup back in BW I can assure you that Amove is an exaggeration.  You still Amove in SC though thats where the term aaa came from in the first.  Once you form a good concave and have a good engagement you focus on certain abilities on your units that make them preform well.  I have no doubt in my mind that from the gameplay weve seen so far that the game is pretty much Kthemed SC but with possibly clunkier controls due to how squad behavior works and melee mechanics being an actual thing.,dawnofwar,df6e2le,1,t5_2s7bq

11503337,0,t1_dfzvtmr,I hate to say this but RTS are not accessible for casual players because of the amount of multitasking required to be a decent player and most casual players will end up sitting in their base amassing a big blob and throwing it against the enemy forces which is not appealing at all whereas in MOBA even if youre a bad player youre always achieving something at least killing creeps  you can rely on your teammates  there is less multitasking. Its hard for RTS to appeal to a more casual audience I think RUSE  did a rather good job because it was more accessible while keeping some depth but its the only recent example I can find. Otherwise I cant see hardcore RTS being a successful genre in the current market meaning that big publishers such as Sega will push to have a more accessible and popular formula which is fine I mean DoW looks to be fun but if we want hardcore RTS we should look at independent studios and what they produced so far was sort of disappointing. ,dawnofwar,dfzwjc8,3,t5_2s7bq
11528818,0,t1_dg2on15,You would be surprised how common it is to force endusers to do something they dont like because data has shown it works much better them even though they individually say it doesnt.When they would release VP mode as well people would only play that because fuck change! no matter if that works better or not. It is commonly known in design that enduser have no clue what they actually want or need and when they are able to chose they usually chose wrong especially when given the choice between something new and something old.. To think your endusers are intelligent enough to pick the options that works best for them is a sure way see your system fail. This is no different in gaming than it is in software development or development in general. I am sure relic data has shown that the power core mode leads to more balanced matches with longer action packed playtime less downtime when you capped all VPs and wait for the enemy to attack again while also keeping the match tense across the whole duration. Ever destroyed the complete army of your enemies in DoW at the min mark? Have fun waiting multiple more minutes while he constantly backcaps and delays the inevitable and you just run from A to B to get the VPs capping down faster. ,dawnofwar,dg2skqb,4,t5_2s7bq

11722864,0,t3_678gt0,So theres a lot of elements Art was heavily critisized but is in my opinion one of the best aspects of the game. The game looks great and while some of the environments suck that v lava map especially. Models are ace especially in army painter and elite viewer. I think its overall beautiful. Design is great. Space Marines are fun to play and so are Orks. The game plays SO MUCH better than how it looks. Elites are great fun and basic units are punchy but vulnerable. Definitely captured the visceral brutal warfare of k I believe. Maps and points are great too. The game is fun and functional and while some mechanics are gone like Wargear and suppression the stealthfog clouds make up a touch for it. I will say vehicles are a bit screwy at the moment  seem to take a lot of damage from lots of different weapons. IIRC this was a problem in DOW as well however. Some races like Space Marines lack some solid antivehicle DPS las devsmaleus tactics just dont cut it. Map design  absolutely horrific. The v map is a clusterfuck in tight corridors vehicles just cant handle the pathing. The v map isnt fun either. The v map I actually think is really good. Game mode  while it works great for v and OK for v v desperately needs more objectives at least one for each player. At the risk of mimicking MOBAs  lanes each with an objective would be great. I think v would be amazing with VPs back to reward more consistent playmap control. Pacing  the game is very... off in its pacing. at the start you can get out  squads depending on raceBO and a building. Then you generate very few for a while while improving econ or getting tier  upgrades. Then depending on your setup you get an elite  space marines get a huge power spike at EP when the deathwatch team arrives and a window for a push  then the other races or a Jonah can counter at EP. This throws the game off a touch but I expect to see deathwatch buffed in HP and pushed back to EP to keep races at an even point unless other races get EP squads in the full release  then the pacing will still be fucky around the EP mark. The UI is awful. It looks OK but its too big and unclear in some places. Space Marine unit icons look EXACTLY the same. Even just having the devastators inverted to look left if they have lascannons or a different icon altogether would be great. We DESPERATELY need a UI scale option for those of us with high resolutions and decent eye sight.  What is nice however is the ability to disable parts of the UI to remove some of the clutter  and switch the map. Good shouts there. Balance. I saw the ESL game yesterday  Eldar are definitely overtuned in a lot of areas but so is Ork Weirdboy and Space Marine DeathwatchASM. I expect minor nerfs all around for these units and I think Orks are going to struggle without some excellent Weirdboy play. Performance. Game runs beautiful like butter. The engineering team should be proud because they have done an amazing job and its day and night compared to COH. Game feels slick and controllable. Lack of a concedesurrender. Stability issues. Cant select custom paint schemes for space marine because the historic chapters push them off the list. Lack of mapable hotkeys. Basic beta stuff which should be fixed lol weekend before release have fun crunching that Relic.Overall Im really excited for the final product. I think its going to be great just a bit rough around the edges as with most Relic releases. Content and patches will no doubt fix and improve... huge amounts. The issues can definitely be fixed within a day early post release patch.,dawnofwar,dgotf07,3,t5_2s7bq
11732497,0,t1_dgpgmno,In this game you get basically refunded with the added bonus of being able to react to the other players units and counter them on the next attack I guess this is lost on many ,dawnofwar,dgpwq35,1,t5_2s7bq
11737860,0,t1_dgqgta9,Interesting. I used the grenade quite a bit. The damage must be very small I never saw the health bar drop suddenly  just from sustained fire. My mistake I guess assuming the rd party tooltip is correct. I cant imagine its very much damage at all then.,dawnofwar,dgqilji,1,t5_2s7bq
11744712,0,t1_dgr47xz,How do you reverse move something?  Im assuming it works for tanks as well.,dawnofwar,dgrajyi,2,t5_2s7bq

11752775,0,t1_dgs43bu,Marines are pretty much OP look at the Ultramarines campaign against the tyranids. They slaughtered millions before taking a single casualties. But balance has a different story to tell one that is necessary for fun. ,dawnofwar,dgs7g2b,1,t5_2s7bq

11768402,1,t1_dgtymrd,As stated in previous comments its not a riot to overthrow the review section...but to weed out the false reviews. And give this NEW REFRESHING rts a chance before it gets buried by peopoe who have ..hrs of gameplay and no real oppinion gathered...nothing wrong with that,dawnofwar,dgtz9c4,-2,t5_2s7bq
11769516,0,t1_dgu3pdp,When in the base radius for squads you have to hit R to reinforce the squad there is a difference between a heal pickup and reinforcing however,dawnofwar,dgu3tbi,14,t5_2s7bq

11774294,0,t3_67vn99,Ive played DoW I and loved it havent got around to buying DoW II yet. I got DoW III for free with my new motherboard that I purchased and was so excited. I usually spend my time fighting AI cause Im not too good against people in games like these but I absolutely love them. ,dawnofwar,dgunfvq,2,t5_2s7bq
11775248,0,t1_dgtuelt,gt By nature RTS games are very hard to learnI really dont think thats true. I was playing Dune  when I was  years old Warcraft  at  and Total Annihilation at  or . Not because I am especially smart or good at games  all of my friends were playing RTS. They may be slightly harder to learn that a lot of modern handholding games but I wouldnt consider them very hard to learn at all.,dawnofwar,dgurd02,1,t5_2s7bq
11776979,0,t3_681j4h,Its possible at the very least this game will likely have a good amount of players in the higher ranks after it is released if only due to the high skill cap in the game.I doubt it will rise as an esport with Sc falling from its throne I fear that the RTS genre might be slipping away from any importance for a few years.,dawnofwar,dguyhtj,3,t5_2s7bq
11777289,0,t3_681kt9,NobodyCanStopTheRock.gif and ofc the mandatory git gud.,dawnofwar,dguzrde,3,t5_2s7bq
11778908,0,t1_dguz2qo,I feel most of what people want can be added easily and or can be added through mods. I think like you said the game is a great canvas for improvement. Its solid now I dont see many bugs etc. Im looking forward. ,dawnofwar,dgv6dd4,1,t5_2s7bq
11778913,0,t1_dgv65rf,I believe you double click the ability,dawnofwar,dgv6e3i,2,t5_2s7bq
11783138,0,t1_dgvmcej,I also enjoy a close game but this is getting close to Mario Kart ai levels of comeback opportunities. ,dawnofwar,dgvnnqb,-2,t5_2s7bq
11790032,0,t1_dgw0ont,I completely agree. If relic increases TTK they are shooting the game in the foot competitivewise.  ,dawnofwar,dgwfud2,2,t5_2s7bq
11802829,0,t1_dgxubph,Jumping over the turrets beam was the bit that got me the most when I watched the replay ,dawnofwar,dgxw3zo,1,t5_2s7bq
11805620,0,t3_68dyd9,My question is why is there an unlock system at all? Its an RTS game it feels kinda weird to be locked out of a lot of optionsIf they wanted a progression system so badly keep it to cosmetics,dawnofwar,dgy7hpf,7,t5_2s7bq
11809938,0,t1_dgyohmr,No it doesnt are you dense? Just because you arent following examples written in the codex or novels for things doesnt mean you can give space marines water guns and having them riding dinosaurs with laser guns for arms.Creative freedom doesnt mean total freedom when working with an existing IP. ,dawnofwar,dgyp4ae,0,t5_2s7bq
