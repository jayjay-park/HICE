6142435,0,t1_cynp0jg,XD Yeah. I still need to play Scorpio as well as a lot of characters...a lot. Speaking of which youve played Asahi right? How was he? Good luck!  I would buy more characters I wouldnt normally like Im planning on buying some but I still have so many characters I havent played. Uggh I really need to catch up on voltage. One time I should just buy all the main stories Ive been meaning to buy and read them. Also season twos. But then sometimes theres even more characters in season two...ugh...,VoltageInc,cyntwuv,1,t5_31ttv
