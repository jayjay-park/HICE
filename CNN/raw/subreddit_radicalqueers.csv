4462408,0,t3_3bdnsp,It does merit mentioning that interest in marriage was for some at least partially a product of experiences during the AIDS crisis. And I wouldnt equate it to participation in the imperialist military not all reforms are alike.I think its possible to critique the liberalism of the mainstream LGBTQ movement while having a little nuance.,radicalqueers,cst5ywv,1,t5_2t1ke
5653999,0,t1_cwxxj10,gt I actually find the privilegeoppression binary to be a illsuited way to make any kind of deeper more nuanced or complex analysis of any issue of oppression or social stigma.Its quite obvious they dont believe in privilege to begin with so how can they be expected to honestly talk about where it fits and where it doesnt?I dont think this person really understands either the concept of privilege or monosexual privilege. Rather than engaging the actual examples of monosexual privilege that have been pointed out they seem to more or less be saying You cant compare apples and oranges when you actually can and its very simple to do so they are both fruit.Their article does not seem to be addressed to the bi community nor does it engage the actual arguments of any actual radical bi people who have written about monosexism or monosexual privilege. Instead it seems to be addressed to gays and lesbians and its all about the author. Hence this person comes off strongly as a respectable bi person. They are reassuring gays and lesbians that no they dont believe those crazy bi people who say things like monosexual privilege and monosexism. They are a good bi person who is safe to invite to the LGBT events. The most tiresome part about this dynamic is how the respectable oppressed person always believes they are individuals going against the grain when what they are doing has actually become a banal cliche. They might be claiming that this is specific or exclusive to bisexuality but they might as well be Caitlyn Jenner talking about the trans community or Bill Cosby talking about black people or any number of others.,radicalqueers,cwxxmlh,-2,t5_2t1ke
