1312528,0,t1_cih9kqm,Yeah I got a trio of fast hawks. Pretty awesome when Im sick of thinking about how my knife landed and where to move. With a hawk I just throw it hard enough itll stick on something lol.,throwing,cih9ydp,4,t5_2t368

10885639,0,t1_de2rlgw,Right? The goal is to be skilled enough to throw any knife while backing up on a moving target. Have a friend charge at you in armor. You will do better then you think you would. Throwing knives is actually quite viable. ,throwing,de2rybg,1,t5_2t368
