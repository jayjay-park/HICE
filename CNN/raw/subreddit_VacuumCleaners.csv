2545220,0,t3_2o22du,The reason the DC is no longer in the US market is because it was a miserable piece of shit that cost Dyson a fortune in warranty repairs. Frankly I am surprised nay flummoxed that it is still available new in Europe.The behavior youre describing is typical of that vac as it has more suction than necessary and poor airflow. I would recommend returning it for a much better vacuum. And stay away from bagless vacs!,VacuumCleaners,cmqsp45,1,t5_2vqfg

5373145,0,t3_3om84s,I have about  on consignment right now x They are definitely built like tanks. Generally the reasons people put them on consignment or trade them in is because theyre heavy lack filtration and overpriced new. I always recommend to Kirby customers that they keep what they have rather then getting sucked into their newest models The parts for the sentrias will fit kirbys all the way back to the G.,VacuumCleaners,cvyha71,1,t5_2vqfg

6277014,0,t1_cz33s7b,It sounds like the key thing for me to do at this point is to get out and talk to some the dealers in my area.

In my case I was able to get a better deal on a Simplicity Symmetry owner cited larger profit margin on them vs Sebo but went with a Sebo Automatic X because I liked it better.,VacuumCleaners,czb96aw,1,t5_2vqfg

6990315,0,t1_d18l7og,No I wouldnt look at the kenmore items. Sears isnt doing well and who knows if panasonic is still going to make vacuums under that name.  As long as you buy a felix that has a Powerhead with electric not just the air brush then yes it will work good for you. I already looked at other vacuums that would work and I would link them to you but they were  CDN  lol. ,VacuumCleaners,d18p03h,1,t5_2vqfg

7774058,0,t1_d3pr6wm,I picked it up this weekend got it for  paying cash. Seems to be a quality machine especially compared to the plastic Dyson it is replacing. Found it to be too powerful for small rugs on the hardwood floors but works great on the carpet upstairs. Bought some bags to go with it I suppose they will continue to make the bags but I guess nothing is guaranteed. Also my simplicity dealer also skipped over the Maytag but when I asked about it they had nothing but good things to say about it.,VacuumCleaners,d3puips,2,t5_2vqfg

9494110,0,t1_d9igo6r,I am going to my local vacuum store on Friday to check out the Homecare line and hope that I can make a decision.  As I was preparing a comparison and question list I found the Miele C Softcarpet model which appears to be identical to the C Kona just with an additional setting for soft carpet whatever that is.  The Softcarpet model has an MSRP of  vs the Kona at .  That seems like a great deal and maybe better than even the C Homecare price.  Any insight into the Softcarpet model which seems to have just come out this past Summer? Just want to make sure I am not missing anything.  Thank you.,VacuumCleaners,d9jcoux,1,t5_2vqfg
9496636,0,t1_d9iqltt,I will give both options a look there are two Simplicity vacuums for sale on my local craigslist Considering picking one up to see if I like them enough to buy them new when the used one craps out. Design wise  what makes them better than the dyson for picking up pet hair? My old dyson was great for suction just had issues with the roller getting stuck with hair. ,VacuumCleaners,d9jnv2k,1,t5_2vqfg

10751014,0,t3_5s9xmj,I have a Miele Marin which works great for my cats. The power brush and suction pull up all the hair and I actually checked the brush the other day and it had  hair stuck around it all of it is being sucked up.Honestly though the Cat amp Dog would have been fine and I actually ordered some of the charcoal filters to try out for better scent control instead of the hepa it came with. The twister tool also does a great job on the hard floors namely the bathroom tile where the litter box is. It will pick up all the litter specs even against the edges of the walls.I also bought a mini turbobrush for stairs which appears to come with the cat and dog standard. I probably wouldve saved some money with the cat and dog and the auto suction on the Marin isnt really necessary at all since I adjust it usually anyways.,VacuumCleaners,ddovuxi,1,t5_2vqfg
10974152,0,t1_debvvay,Thanks man! Thats reassuring. What do you think is fair market price for this vacuum? Do you know how this model compares to the newer Supralites? Looking online it seems like this is an older model. Do you think its strong enough for medium pill carpet?Appreciate your input. ,VacuumCleaners,debxisb,2,t5_2vqfg
