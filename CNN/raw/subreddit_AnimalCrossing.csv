6177,0,t1_ceetmfu,Yes indeed it does. However there will be a point that the WiFi itemsNintendo Zone disturbations will be stopped just like they did with City FolkLGttC after New Leaf was realeased but that only happens once there is either another handheld Animal Crossing game in the future or if the Wii U Animal Crossing game gets released. But the latter is mostly false so dont worry about it just only remember that WiFi items usually change once a month. Cheers!,AnimalCrossing,cef51uz,1,t5_2ro2c

The Roost has its own classy nook but beyond the bushes next to it is a thick and difficult to navigate fruit forest. The only straight path in it runs from the upper bridge to the campsite and mayors house. With all the rustic PWPs spread throughout its almost physically impossible for anyone to move into the forest.The rest of the town is rather spacious. I kind of wish the villagers would spread out more the spot between the pond and the waterfall is just begging for a house.

Its almost impossible to miss a moveout this way unless you time travel.You could also do a bit of a trick to check if anyone is moving out. If youre not averse to changing your system clock go to your DSs settings set your system clock to at least  week forward then start Animal Crossing with a new character. Dont start with an existing character! Check if theres any missing houses. If theres a missing house then that means that villager will move out in the near future. You can then exit the game set your system clock to your present date and resume playing with your usual character. Since the moveout is yet to occur in the future you have the option to prevent it or to allow it when that villager pings you. ,AnimalCrossing,cf54hdz,2,t5_2ro2c

369949,0,t3_1ybulg,Its impossible to ensure a trade since theres a mandatory savequit part that takes place right in the middle of the trading process. The best advice I can give is to let the user with more rep get their villager first ie older Reddit account andor a higher rating via ACTrade and AMVs new rose flair system that way the user has more to lose if they choose to scam you.Also check out our ban list and  strikes list before going through with any trade even if the user youre with doesnt have a boot or turnip flair. Sometimes the mods havent updated a user in time or the user has created a new account but still uses the same FC.Happy trading ,AnimalCrossing,cfj3zqk,2,t5_2ro2c

433943,0,t3_1z1uef,Heres what happenedI have a few New Leaf friends who are just kids eleven years old I think and they like to play in my town. I dont mind theyre always polite and courteous and I think theyre hilarious. Sometimes Ill leave my gate open so that they can come play while I do housework or play around online or whatever.The other night I left my gate open for the kids and accidentally dozed off for perhaps twenty minutes. When I woke up the kids were gone but I had a visitor in my town. I like having visitors so I didnt think anything of it. Pretty much the second I noticed he was there he told me had to go and asked me to end the session. I let him go and turned off the game for the night.The next day I went to do my normal Mayor stuff and noticed that a lot of things in my town looked off. I then realized that a lot of my flower layouts had been picked through or were completely gone.I couldnt believe it! I ran around my town counting how many of my flowers were gone he took SIXTY FOUR of my flowers! Im so angry I was almost discouraged from trying to regrow them all over again. I like leaving my gate open for the kids and for other friends I have I do it all the time and have never ever had a problem with thieves. On that same note I would never EVER think of stealing things from other peoples towns under any circumstances. I think the worst part of this is that if he had just asked me for hybrids I would have given them to him! I give my AC friends cool free shit all the time Im constantly unloading baskets of perfect fruit on visitors I always lowball prices on stuff Im selling I just like to help out people who are trying to make their towns better because I always appreciated the help when I was just starting out. I know its partially my own fault for being so naive but its so frustrating that I was taken advantage of like that. I cannot remember the guys name or the name of his town but I will know it if I see it again. I narrowed it down to a few people on  my DS friend list and Im almost certain of who it is. Once Im positive Im spreading the word since hes someone I friended here on reddit.EDITI cannot BELIEVE how great you guys are. I mean it the fact that you guys all jumped to help me get my town back to how it was is just wonderful I cant thank you enough for your kindness and generosity. I could just cry thank you all. I sincerely appreciate every single offer youve all made but I no longer need any more flowers I now have back every hybrid that was stolen and then some  I adore you all thank you for helping me.In other news Im a little closer to finding the guy who did this D VERY IMPORTANT EDITThanks to a few stealthy and very helpful members of this sub we figured out who the culprit is. If any of you are friends with a player by the name of Eliza Pewd delete them immediately. Their town is called paris and their FC is . I friended her through rACTrade where she is very active her reddit account is urockyolo . As far as we can tell she uses her Mayor character Eliza to friend people and a secondary character to basically be a dick. Shes been reported to rACTrade and rAdoptMyVillager by uMayorofLoquest thanks!. Thank you so much everyone for your generosity and your awesome detective skills.,AnimalCrossing,cfpqrbx,112,t5_2ro2c

437684,0,t3_1z319k,Ive been playing since November and Ive clocked over  hours. It seems impossible but im a full time college student and I still have tons of time that I WANT to play AC. For the first month I was dead set on becoming a bellionare. I even made a song. I wanna be a bellionare so freakin bad buy all the sets I never had. I wanna be on the cover of Grace Magazine smiling at Maple and Eddy! Maple is my BFFs favorite and Ed is mine. Anyway! I spent around  hours a night grinding by catching beetles on the island. I also spent a lot of time with Ed and plotting the demise of Frita because many villagers have told me of their friendship. I would send crazy letters about how she needed to leave for good. I had a blast. In December I discovered Reddit. Needless to say my AC life grew vastly due to actrade and acturnips. I only had a million bells at this time so poor. Through finding acturnips I had finally become a bellionare. Try turnips weekly! I also continue to look for sought after items using actrade daily. Did you know theres over  villagers in this game? How many have you seen? Needless to say experiencing just  is no fun at all! Id go through a list with pictures and pick out some dreamie villagers. Mine are Ed Fauna Flora and Chadder. In case you didnt know they are villagers you like talking to and you want to keep them forever. So I have fun cycling through my town to try and obtain them. If none of that is your fancy why not try growing hybrids and decorating your town with them in cool patterns. I have x set of RAINBOW ROSES. Yes I said rainbow. I did a line of  of red then below a line of orange below that a line of yellow below a line of blue then purple then white then pink. I actually made  sets of these. It took me over a month because I didnt want to cheat by TTing but I was so excited each day to get to add  flowers to my growing rainbows. Have you made paths? It really adds to the atheistic look of your town. Make a path at least x so when people run around they wont run off the course. Make sure they lead to each villagers house retail train station roost and police station. And that they all connect together in the end. That took me about  hours alone but I felt so accomplished after.Did you decorate your house yet? Did you fully build it? Theres a total of  rooms that can be upgraded two times a piece. It ends up costing around  million bells its a mighty feat to accomplish. I am going for the whole zen look. Zen mailbox exterior roof fence. Not to mention what you can put inside the house. You can do whole sets I have the full rococo in one room and have added my own touches such as a record player that is playing K.K Sotana which sounds like classical music. I also added a fireplace some fancy Redd paintings and a Pic of Fauna. My attic space is half sloppy setrandom stuff that looks like classroom stuff. I added a huge bookshelf homework sets a laptop and desktop computer. Basically I wanted it to look like a busy college students study room. So you dont have to stay within the confines of sets or completely out of them. You can blend! DBadges are the most fun though. Those are like my ultimate goals. Im not sure how I will ever get the one that requires like  street passes as I am quite a hermit. But I take pride in my gold turnip trading and tree planting badge. Im looking forward to the badge I will get for playing  hours. Im SO close! As you can see I am still not bored of AC. Its gonna be awhile before I do. Keep in mind that I have around  hours of math homework a week and still find all this time. Wow. I need a life! HA!DUDE! I just saw my post and it is SO LONG!!!,AnimalCrossing,cfq4q85,28,t5_2ro2c

612567,0,t3_215v6y,Well Im sorry to hear that youre so dissatisfied with your villagers! Restarting your town can be really rough.What youve said about putting your importanttoyou items into a storage item I just want to make sure you understand that your storage is linked to your town and when you reset your village all of your stored items will be gone. You will need to go to your friends locker at the train station pull these items out and leave them on the ground in your friends town with all of the bells youre saving. Also maybe some of each fruit and breeding pairs of hybrids might be a good idea.It sounds like you have the right idea you really do just leave stuff on the ground in a different town and pick it up after restarting. I just wanted to make sure to specify that any storage would be deleted we somewhat recently had a case here where someone put all their belongings into a wardrobe and left just that at their friends town and was devastated because he didnt know how the storage system worked.,AnimalCrossing,cg9wfs7,4,t5_2ro2c

I also saw that tarantulas spawn a little bit more even if the odds arent different I got  tarantulas against  scorpions for a  hour play time and got the tarantula. I dont know if people saw that but most of the time when you have the net in your hands and the devil bug sees you it stops and look at you without moving. Then its easy to get if youre not stressed like me and miss it xD Im still looking for the scorpion as you said it seems they are more in the flowers or near buildings and I got scared by one who jumped out of a red flower patch xD But Ill try your tip its interesting ,AnimalCrossing,cjplv1x,2,t5_2ro2c

1709723,0,t3_2dx4uy,I cosplayed as Reese for OzComicon in Melbourne this year. Ive always thought about posting a pic in here but people on the internet can be mean sometimes! I chose Reese because I thought she would be recognisable and her costume seemed achievable to create plus shes super cute and I wanted to be super cute for a day! I bought a wig off eBay with curly pigtail buns. I sewed myself an apron and hand stitched on felt crosses and giant buttons. Unfortunately I had pattern and sewing machine troubles when I started making my dress so there was a mad dash the week before trying to find a pink dress very hard it would seem!. I found one that suited perfectly in the end.On the day I had a few people take photos with me and a few complimented me on my costume. As I was walking around I heard some comments like ITS REESE! in a hushed whisper.It was heaps of fun. Definitely helped that I have friends who are Cosplay pros to help me out.

I was in a hotel room with three other people. The beds were Gracie beds and golden beds. Eventually someone tells us that we cant have any customized golden furniture in our room when a certain person does inspection. There were lots of gold furniture but not all of them were customized. The only way we could figure out if something was customized or not was if we picked up the furniture and looked inside our pockets to see if the leaf was red. For some reason the golden beds werent customized. I ended up with a full pocket of red leaves. I woke up before the inspector came though ,AnimalCrossing,ck3ebu7,2,t5_2ro2c

1996463,0,t1_cktrvpt,ampampamp For the Love of God sfw gtFor the Love of God is a sculpture by artist Damien Hirst produced in . It consists of a platinum cast of an thcentury human skull encrusted with  flawless diamonds including a pearshaped pink diamond located in the forehead that is known as the Skull Star Diamond. The skulls teeth are original and were purchased by Hirst in London. The artwork is a Memento mori or reminder of the mortality of the viewer. In  art historian Rudi Fuchs observed The skull is out of this world celestial almost. It proclaims victory over decay. At the same time it represents death as something infinitely more relentless. Compared to the tearful sadness of a vanitas scene the diamond skull is glory itself.  Costing  million to produce the work was placed on its inaugural display at the White Cube gallery in London in an exhibition Beyond belief with an asking price of  million. This would have been the highest price ever paid for a single work by a living artist. gtgtImage iInteresting For the Love of God instrumental | For the Love of God film | Love of God | Damien Hirst Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcktrvs oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecktrvs. Will also delete on comment score of  or less. | FAQs | Mods | Magic Words,AnimalCrossing,cktrvs3,1,t5_2ro2c

The phrase Unity through strength strength through unity is the slogan of Norsefire the party that takes over the UK in a fascist coup a la Pinochet minus the help of the U.S. of course in V for Vendetta. Alan Moore was writing it in a statement against Margaret Thatcher whom he saw as what leftist Americans saw in George W Bush. Maoism is also unique to China because it incorporates Confucian aspects into communist ideology. Juche also does this. Tom Nook is a member of the bourgeoisie so a communist dictatorship would be against his interests. A fascist corpocracy would make more sense.

2733556,0,t1_cner9nq,My experiences and the AC wiki seems to also suggest its once a day  at least for New Leaf  though it seems his appearance is by chance.gtIn Animal Crossing New Leaf Pascal might appear upon finding a scallop in the players town. He will surface behind the player and request that they give it to him. If they do he will give them a furniture from the Pirate Theme and a piece of philosophy. This can only be done once a day. However if their pockets are full Pascal will not appear. Sometimes after the scallop is given to him Pascal can be seen swimming just outside the southern border of the ocean.gtThe exact odds of Pascal appearing after catching are unknown but Pascal will not appear during holidays Although he has turned up on Bunny Day and Harvest Festival or if the player has their town gate open. Pascal also wont appear if the scallop is caught on the island.,AnimalCrossing,cneskxm,6,t5_2ro2c

4639192,0,t1_ctfbl8z,Well what I do is the classic routine daily stuff first like fossils and money rock then I go to the stores and buy everything I want. This alone takes about  minutes for me at least. In acnl you need a lot of bells. I gave a friend  million bells and she spent it in one day on her house and a windmill. You have your house loan which is expensive and the town projects. There are plenty of different ways to make money some more effective than others but it still takes a while. Then there are stuff like patterns. You can make pro designs so you dont have to wear the horned hat and can edit the front back and sleeves of the shirt your making. So if you design a town path youve gotta have everything planned out like route and stuff and just making the patterns is very time consuming. There is more reason to collect sets of furniture like regal and classic too. Its kinda like I stated earlier its not about the game its what you do with it! ,AnimalCrossing,ctfc5zm,1,t5_2ro2c

4661043,0,t3_3esaw3,TLDR Reset until you get the town you want. I dont regret doing it two times so far.I reset a total of two times so far. The first game I statred out doing good but I wanted to see what the other buildings were like. So that meant a lot of time traveling. I didnt put to much time into the town with how it looked I just wanted to see all the shops. After a while the game got boring because I had done almost everything I wanted in a short time frame. I also didnt bother with trying to get original town folks photos. Well I left for a while and when I came back I reset my town and started all over again. This town was going good but again not what I hopped for and again I cheated by time traveling and letting the town folk leave without pictures. So I left again. About two months ago at most I restarted onces again. I have made it a point that I will not time travel but let the game go with the way it was supposed to be and this is the best town I have had yet. I have no regrets resetting to get to this point. I still have all my original residents however no pictures yet my fault I havent put a lot of time into this part yet. My house is maxed out size wise but Im still trying to get he inside of it the way I want. Almost done though.  So yeah if your not happy keep resetting until you get the right feel for the town.,AnimalCrossing,cti2x4d,2,t5_2ro2c

Here are the steps for the diving trick Make sure youre carrying as few bells as possible and your pockets are full with things villagers cant buy e.g. flowers fruit. This is to prevent villagers from pinging you requesting to buy thingsgiving you thingsselling you thingsetc. Hang out in an isolated area where you wont run into any villagers. The beach works really well for this. Or you can actually go diving as the name of this trick suggests. Wait for at least  minutes. I usually do  to be on the safe side. Walk around in front of your villagers until one pings you. If youve done step one the only pings youll get are for a PWP request asking you to change their nickname or some random silly question. If you didnt get a PWP request repeat until you do.If you are looking for a specific PWP from a specific villager personality you can trap that villager by digging holes around them so you can find them easily lol. In my experience this makes the process waaay longer though because sometimes they just wont ping you even though other villagers will.

Just pick two villagers that you want to keep talk to them until they wont talk to you anymore then if they dont mention anyone moving TT to the next day. Repeat until you find a mover. Usually I find that villagers want to move every  days. Sometimes I find that they want to move every other day or every day though lolNote if the mover changes their mind. turn off your game without saving. you can either ignore them from there or go back up to them and repeat until they agree to leave.,AnimalCrossing,cuzgjz6,2,t5_2ro2c

5232329,0,t3_3mo8qk,Hi there. General advice I can give you is to just experience the game at any pace that feels right to you. While its true there are many things that can happen in your game that are very difficult to undo its better only to try to tightly control these things on your second playthrough. So play have fun dont be afraid to play as much or as little as you find fun.Also if you would like to trade items or find people to visit your town I recommend ractrade as these things are banned in this reddit.,AnimalCrossing,cvgoq41,5,t5_2ro2c

5295574,0,t3_3niwyx,I would actually go with HHD for college. It is very goal oriented and you can just close your DS once you reach your class. Nothing progresses while it is closed so you dont miss out on anything. It is a very player friendly game. This means that it is about your play experience rather then having things happen while the system is off. I dont see it really holding my interest for to long I do see it being great for planing out rooms for NL. You choice mate but either will work well.,AnimalCrossing,cvokk39,4,t5_2ro2c

The odds are slim but chance is a funny thing. For instance in NL Sylvia moved to both of my towns on the same day this week. What are the odds! ,AnimalCrossing,cxw5r0b,3,t5_2ro2c

About being able to create your own holidays create your tourneys fishing bug hunting etc. Placing other villager homes so they dont ruin stuff.

6199940,0,t1_cys7tda,Really? I honestly liked the art direction of Wild World much better than New Leaf. Aside from the font and graphics looking a little jaggy I think the graphics were really well done. They were minimal vibrant and consistent in direction while being absolutely functional.New Leaf kind of comes across as seeming like the graphics were cut a bit short of their vision due to the limitations of the system. Although more detailed and realistic in many aspects I feel that there wasnt a great balance between cartoony charm and realistic detail. A major downside here is the neutralizationdesaturation of colors especially in the outside environment. LoZ Wind Waker is a great example of looking amazing while not trying to seemingly struggle between realism and consistency with the minimal design.Honestly the artists did an amazing job in both games but I preferred wild world. I can understand how it didnt age well with the very low resolution of the DS however.,AnimalCrossing,cyud7rz,3,t5_2ro2c

Also use the sneak feature with the net as soon as you hear them. Move at half speed if theyre facing you and full speed if theyre moving away.

I wouldnt view it as the next step in the animal crossing franchise rather a step to the side. Ive heard it put that the way that game works is you loose a lot of the features you normally have in exchange for being able to do stuff you never get to do in the main series such as design peoples houses and dress them up at will. Also being able to maintain villagers without worrying about them moving. But I can understand that thats not the type of game for everyone and everyones entitled to their opinion about it. ,AnimalCrossing,d5knpsg,1,t5_2ro2c

After youve set it back  hours or opposite of how you set the clock in the first place open up Animal Crossing and just set Animal Crossings internal clock which you can set by when opening with Isabelle and she asks you if you can start instead of saying yes you tap the other option and you can set the games clock from there ,AnimalCrossing,d5zppsa,1,t5_2ro2c

She said that we never really got to be good friends with each other and that she would stay for our friendship... I reset my game. The one time I ever did that. All because of her.... I despise her. She moved out after I decided to ignore her. And my town was in bliss. I decided to put a Zen garden near where she was in commemoration of my victory.

9192260,0,t3_567cr6,Dont run unless it is away from bees. Running kills your grass.    Find and hit your random money rock with your shovel every day.  It really helps to have that steady bonus.     Talk to Isabelle regularly and ask her for advice.  She will give you useful tips and items.     Talk to all your villagers on a regular basis so you can build your friendship with them.  This increases the kinds of things they will request from you including public works projects that otherwise dont get unlocked.         Visit the island in the evening and catch the bugs on the trees near the short. Those beetles are worth a lot of bells.  Sell them at ReTail when you get back home.    If you choose to timetravel change the clock be careful.  It can result in prompt villager move outs if you move many days in either direction.  Same day timetravel is generally harmless.  Enjoy yourself.  Dont feel pressured to do everything at once it can get overwhelming.      ,AnimalCrossing,d8h6qa6,3,t5_2ro2c

9246262,0,t3_56x5hy,I think it would be cool if there was a gym in the town area where you could like go visit and play like a boxing or jump rope mini game and playing here often  drinking a protein drink or something leads to your character getting more buff. This way you can play here as often as you want and not change if you dont want to but can if you choose to. The gym manager could be a boxing wallaby or kangaroo which would lend itself well to teaching you how to both jump rope and box the only problem being that there are already kangaroo villagers. The manager could also be a large buff lobster instead a la Larry the Lobster. Jock villagers would hang out here most often and now it would make more sense when they talk about going to work out. They could even bring back the jogs around town with villagers meeting in the gym lobby at a specific time and day. ,AnimalCrossing,d8o14yg,1,t5_2ro2c

Its a bit limited to earn each day so dont do that and youll only get a minimal amountYes sell your perfect fruit as person below said in a town whose nonnative fruit is the perfect fruit youre trying to sell for premium earning you even more bellzzz. You should be able to do this easier in rACTrade but please read their rules especially concerning perfect fruitsellingAs an active promoter of the use of turnips I will ask you to reconsider using the stalk market. Trust me it really helps especially if youre trying to earn tht ABD. Each week invest more and more turnips the average for getting at least a million bells a week is buying a few thousand turnips e.g. spending k etc or however many you can get and then every day check racturnips for the highest price to sell preferably . Your bank will greatly increase. Now I have two characters and currently I spend about a million bells for each of their turnip loads and for each of them this takes about  minutes really. Now selling can take about  minutes when I visit another for each of my two characters. So add up  minutes of buying and  minutes of selling to get only an hour and a half each week. Now those numbers are when Im spending a million so think how much less itll take for spending about  for the firsst few weeks. Next compare it to island hunting. People approximately spend about  hours of filling their deposit box only to earn about k. Do it every night and youll roughly get around . million bells for  hours in a week,AnimalCrossing,da1cfq8,2,t5_2ro2c

9957737,0,t1_daz1ayi, I will try to explain but their may be better resources elsewhere. I believe I found a thread on the Bell Tree forums to help me out. AnywayThe trick is to anticipate when villages are going to put down a plot BEFORE you load your MayorSide character save file on any day after am. Before loading your character the trick is to create a new save file go through the conversation with Rover get off the train and before even bothering to go to the Town Hall check your village for the villagers plot. If the plot is in a spot you do not like you can hard reset your game home  close software  open software and create another New Save File and repeat the above process. If the plot is where you want it you must continue the process of the New Game file up to the save point which includes choosing a plotting the New Game file house. This plot takes up more space than a village plot but you can go in and demolish the house after saving and quitting once. In my experience the villager plots do gravitate towards preferred spots and will do it multiple times in a row but if you continue to reset it will move. ,AnimalCrossing,db5iog2,1,t5_2ro2c

If you have ten villagers you can pick which villager moves out. If you have fewer than ten villagers the Amiibo one will just move in and Pompom will stay so youll have to keep scanning in and moving in Amiibo villagers until you can kick Pompom out.,AnimalCrossing,dcghshd,3,t5_2ro2c

10382104,0,t1_dckgq50,No Ive used the ereader extensively and theres no way to get characters from the cards to move to your game whether village or island. The cards only give you letters and items and a few other goodies like designs or town tunes.As for the island it only has one islander who is permanent. You can however trade islands with another town which will include swapping of islanders. Thats the only way to get a different animal living on your island.Doubutsu No Eori e a sort of updated version of the Gamecube version that was only released in Japan DID let you move characters in through ereader cards. However there was a separate set of ereader cards than the ones pictured here that did that. Again though thats just the JPN versionthe American GC version had no functionality to move in anyone through cards.,AnimalCrossing,dckvj91,1,t5_2ro2c

11585541,0,t1_dg96pcj,Maybe if there are not any valid uncovered spots for them to move into they just move on a path anyways? Ive been wondering what would happen if you have  villagers and  pattern coverage in your town. Would new villagers never move in or would they move over patterns?,AnimalCrossing,dg9883r,1,t5_2ro2c
11606642,0,t3_65krm3,Aside from some of the things already brought up skin tone etc. what I would like to see most is different text colors for items if you dont have them in your catalog. That way I dont have to check an app or website for every item I come across to see if I have it yet. Say a villager wants to sell you an item and the text color is yellow instead of blue denoting its a new item for you.I would like to see villager interactions being more interesting too. Bring back GC style interactions where the villagers had more interesting things to say and the personalities actually felt different. Also having separate dialogue options for small talk and asking if they have a favor again would be great.Right now interactions feel really... Manufactured. Theres always five villagers roaming the town. Youll get one of each type of errand a day and no more. Theyre always talking about how its such a great day to skip around with some obscure food. It just doesnt feel very organic.,AnimalCrossing,dgbmfcd,19,t5_2ro2c
