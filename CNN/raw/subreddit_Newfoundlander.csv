138089,0,t1_cerh5ga,honestly the price is the least interesting part of buying a puppy. the little guy has to be healthy and well socialized thats important.newfs are expensive in switzerland you have to pay between  and  swiss francs no question but theyre worth every penny. and i personally appreciate this because normally everybody whos willing to pay the price didnt buy such a dog just out of the blue sky.if you fear that you cant afford the price of a puppy get a rescue. i dont know how its handled in the US in europe a rescue costs about  euros about  . of course these are adults normally rescued puppies are very very rare thank goodness!. or look for a puppy in a forbidden color e. g. in canada brown is not allowed by the newfoundland club breeding rules.,Newfoundlander,ceu5pom,2,t5_2tvso

814312,0,t3_23d3t4,The only other thing I have to add to all of this wonderful advice is that youll have to train your friends as much as your new dog. Your bundle of fluff will be bigger than some people and itll go easier on you if the dog learns not to take advantage of being outside of your watchful gaze. My newf loves giving hugs and my friends have happily learned how to discourage her from jumping on them. Shes only  lbs now and Im glad shes learning early instead of when shes big enough to knock someone down. ,Newfoundlander,cgwua8o,2,t5_2tvso

3132414,0,t3_2vzpvn,Newf owner here.  Hate to say it but it sounds exactly like what ours went through w blown out knees.  Very common in the breed.  See your vet for sure and they can diagnose.  If its the case good news is they can fix it w surgery.  Bad news is its expensive as hell and a long recovery... And usually if they blow out one the other one ends up going too.  Mine had both of hers done over a little more than a year.  Made an amazing recovery though and shes good as new now.   If this ends up being the deal something to consider is if you have a good vet school win driving distance taking your dog to their vet hospital for the surgery.  Ours ended up being done by one of the best orthopedic vets in the state and our pup had vet students taking care of her .  We even left our newf at the hospital for a few extra days to make sure she was making good recoveries and to have the pros oversee her first few days of rehab... At no extra charge.  Anyway hope its something else.  Send me a message if you have any questions.Edit just noticed you used kilograms... Not from the states.  Not a clue about best places for vet surgery outside the U.S.,Newfoundlander,como87x,1,t5_2tvso

Yesterday the folks who were in wheelchairs she would shimmy her way as close as she could though their legs then plop her big head right down in their lap for some loves. It was very very sweet. ,Newfoundlander,dbb9xh8,2,t5_2tvso
