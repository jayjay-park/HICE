1090279,0,t3_26lnkh,Yeah the rathena forums helped me when I tried it. Its pretty much ready to go though if you download the right client. Just run it and then you can start playing a bit of messing around if you want GM powers changing rates etcAlternatively you can support the new RedditRO just head over to its subreddit we need more active players,RagnarokOnline,chs7uii,1,t5_2sch7
1201202,0,t1_ci3zazx,I agree. You really missed most of the progression. If youre missing the prerenewal feel I recommend playing there. Its pretty active and theres a lot of nice people. Its worth a shot if you miss prerenewal. With cash shop items I dont think youd have much trouble catching up. If youre missing the classic pretrans feel youre going to have to do pservers. I heard about SimplyRO which looks like the only real classic pserver. Just depends on if youre willing to go that route. Id at least get on the iRO server to check it out first.

5323910,0,t3_3nl9rq,Double dagger sins are INCREDIBLY gear reliant. You have to have daggers for every race. If you dont have cards against the races your damage will suffer hard. My advice is until you get at least a couple sets of daggers complete to just roll a Katar with sind winder card. Faster Aspd and easier early on. Once you get your daggers you should be able to switch out to them without much issue. Make sure you know whether or not cards work on off hand and whether theyre hindered or not. That will HUGELY impact damage output as well. If they dont work in off hand make sure your primary hand has the main carded dagger and the offhand be an elemental weapon so you get elemental bonus. Double daggers can be Hella fun though. In pvp I would focus on being a single target status infliction sin. Get like a triple silence triple stun dagger or maybe poison in one of them so they lose natural sp regeneration. Theres so much you can do . If you give more specifics on where you need advice let me know. ,RagnarokOnline,cvs6who,1,t5_2sch7

5340138,0,t1_cvu94yg,What I would do then is farm Bylan dungeon izlude dungeon OR if you have flee for it Alligators in comodo field. You can NPC their alligator skins for like Zeny each  I think with overcharge  sorry it has been a while. Thatll be an easy way to get some starting zeny. Plus if your server has it theres an alligator turn in quest that can easily help you level up if you want to opt into leveling over the zeny farming. So alligators or Izlude dungeon would be your best bet right now.,RagnarokOnline,cvu9fb8,1,t5_2sch7

5959605,0,t1_cy0u0b9,Several years ago the game was updated with Renewal. It updated a bunch of old game mechanics and introduced the rd classesand increased the level cap.Any characters you had back in  will be on renewal for sure. Some people prefer to play on Classic.  Classic is much closer to the original game but its still definitely far more forgiving than it was back in our day. Unless you already have a strong preference for classic you wont have any issues with renewal.,RagnarokOnline,cy0u2ez,1,t5_2sch7
6298549,0,t1_cz5kfua,Complete and total dedication the ability to communicate with your players well having a general idea of what youre set out to make and not just doing everything any player suggests the creativity to come up with tools and content to make the game more enjoyable and being willing and able to learn how to script. I had no scripting knowledge prior to beginning my server but now I pride myself in my scripts. This goes for both the rAthena scripting language and the source code. If youre doing everything solo you also need to know how to set a website up how to do graphic design and how to control a linux server. Theres probably more things I missed. It helps if you know the game inside and out.,RagnarokOnline,cz5koag,2,t5_2sch7

7271913,0,t3_4eg4g2,When you want to try out a Renewal private server and  of your skills are bugged or dont work at all then there is really no reason in forcing yourself to play it. Thats how it was back when Renewal was released and I believe that is the main reason why it never caught on in the private server scene. There are probably only  good Renewal server Leika and Nova. The rest has to deal with bugged Renewal mechanics.And the worst part is that Renewal was also extremely bugged on official servers as well.,RagnarokOnline,d24rn12,1,t5_2sch7
7336610,0,t3_4fs06f,I dont personally play any private servers anymore but I still poke around the RO community from what Ive seen Sarah server seems to be the most populated prerenewal RO server. Nearly  players peaked or something and I heard dual clienting is forbidden  no auto traders? So those might actually be nearly  unique players online. I never played the server so somebody here may clarify this.most popular renewal server would definately be Nova RO imo. ,RagnarokOnline,d2c4en7,2,t5_2sch7

Its a pretty rad server and the populations isnt just vendors like a lot of high pop servers Multi client is allowed and there appears to be a soft limit of  although unless youre insane like me youll likely never encounter that.Having said that if youre looking to grind lvls  of Lvling on nova is done through eden quests. Gramps. In particular. Its very much an endgame pvppve type server.

9385924,0,t3_59511b,Ill make the best TLDR I can based on my experiences. Probably biased since I prefer PreRenewal. Renewal is very linear in terms of progression. You pretty much follow Area  gt Area  gt Area  to level. PreRenewal is not very linear at all. You can go from Area  gt Area  gt Area  to level depending on your needs. Renewal feels very AoE heavy and v mob kills seem to be very inefficient. PreRenewal allows for v monster killing to still have its place. Renewal feels more like every class is capable of everything whereas PreRenewal feels more like every class is unique and has its particular place. Both PreRenewal and Renewal are going to have certain skills which feel OP and imbalanced. Pick your poison. All newer content is made for Renewal. If you want to keep receiving updates in terms of content youll likely have to play renewal since content stopped being developed for PreRenewal long ago. Some servers do attempt to continue developing content for PreRenewal though. Theres EXP and Drop Rate penalties in renewal which forces you to level at monsters near your level. PreRenewal does not have these penalties which I believe promotes trying to challenge yourself. Renewal will gimp your EXP if you attempt monsters that they deem are too strong for you even if you can kill it. Lots of differences in terms of stats. PreRenewal stats work more exponentially whereas Renewal stats work linearly.  Soloing feels far more prominent in Renewal than PreRenewal.ampnbspI dont think that one is better than the other its really just a matter of preference. I think theres a lot more to it than just nostalgia.If you prefer more modernstyle MMOs where everything is linear you prefer to play solo want to be able to play any class with ease and you like a little bit of handholding Renewal is for you.If you like to challenge yourself with harder monsters for more reward want to freeroam to find where to level like a good bit of partying and dont mind having zero handholding you might have to ask other players for help then PreRenewal is for you.,RagnarokOnline,d95qcth,6,t5_2sch7
