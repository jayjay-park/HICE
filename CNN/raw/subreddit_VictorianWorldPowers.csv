4177216,0,t1_crwclg0,Granted but the fact is that the lack of regard for realism in terms of troop movements is having a detrimental impact on the game that people actually have complained about wars that start and end in a day sometimes if youre lucky two. Take the war between Sicily and Milan for example. Day one Sicily and Milan both claim to be the true Italy. Day two war breaks out Sicily defeats the Milanese in like three different places takes Milan annexes them forms Italy. Given that it takes one day under the rules of the game to raise new regiments or mobilize militia that means there is no possibility whatsoever for strategy. Any given war is virtually guaranteed to play out the same way. Im not saying we need a simulatora simulator would take all these factors into account and would quickly become impossibly difficult to run. Im saying we need to reflect on how troop movements are handled and maybe settle on a flat minimum in order to solve the apparent issue. Otherwise were left with wars that dont really work because one side wins the first battle teleports to the capital and annexes the other. World War I will last if all the Great Powers get involved and the current paradigm stands maybe four days.Incidentally the benefit this confers will extend further than just making warfare an actually functional part of the game which I think most people would agree it currently isnt. Battles are okay sure but wars as a whole just dont work right now. This kind of stringent limit on the speed of troop movement encourages posts like Russia mobilises armies on the Prussian border so that the player can argue that their units are already mobilised and ready to move and thus gain an advantage... Interesting RP and a potential source for diplomacy whichlets face itis the whole point!,VictorianWorldPowers,crweotm,1,t5_37biz
