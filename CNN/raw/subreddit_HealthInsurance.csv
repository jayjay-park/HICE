Your own voluminous research tells you as much.gtEven if it were rare the concern at least is not exaggerated because the purpose of health insurance like car insurance for the majority of people is precisely for extreme financial situations.Yes. I anticipate that it will be rare that you choose to be hospitalized somewhere outside the region where you live  where your health insurances network hospitals are located  in nonemergency situations.Slate and CNBC and Wall St Journal are all fine publications with some capable correspondents. They are not insurance authorities. gtIt is not unreasonable that I find the loss of the outofnetwork outofpocket maximum in the largest insurance company in my state as a significant problem.Again I agree if the insurer is not prepared to treat an emergency admission to a nonnetwork hospital as innetwork subject to your innetwork outofpocket cap.

Well you cant put it on hold but it MAY be financially worthwhile to forego coverage during your enviable stay in Spain.
