3149488,0,t1_coofchb,Alright sounds like Im on the right track. I got brave and swam down to what I think was a barren biome today where the sea floor was nothing more than rocks and sand and there was a distinct absence of wildlife not even sharks.Ive actually been pretty thorough around my islands Im okay swimming in the depths to find shipwrecks up until I find that dropoff into the blackness. Once found a ship right on the edge of the black where it was so dark that your character starts to feel ill. Just simply couldnt loot it though it was so dark the torch couldnt even light it up. But I think Im getting a better idea of the structure of the seafloor now. And it sounds like the twodeck and threedeck shipwrecks I was finding are indeed the largest ones possible and therefore the ones that should have the rare loot Ive just been fortunate to find a lot near land with their control towers protruding from the water sometimes even.What mapping program are you using? I was trying to find some sort of a general cartography application either oncomputer or in a browser but every single one is designed to work with current realworld maps and roads nothing really good for ocean charting.Edit Never mind I found the mapper.,strandeddeep,coofw7h,2,t5_2xcvr
3166155,0,t1_coq4bgq,gtI think its a players responsibility to report bugs when they see them in any AlphaBeta. Perhaps this is your first time participating in an early access? If people dont report bugs regardless of if anyone else has experienced it just leads to wider problems further down the development road. Right now a tiny number of people with a limited number of PC configurations play the game  when it reaches launch level the devs will want to have nailed down as many of the limited to this configuration types of bugs as possible or there will be thousands of people with issues when the game becomes wide spread. Reporting Bugs and Bashing the game into the ground and leaving negative comments like waste of moneyDont buy itWont buy it ect... is not cool if you dont like it keep that to your self or write a review on some website dont spam the steam discussions with garbage like that when you know it is a AlphaBeta and no i am not new to Betas maybe i just really like this game and kinda took it a little too personal for that i am sorry and i apologize i just got really heated reading some stupid comments today thats all.,strandeddeep,coq65r0,1,t5_2xcvr

This is one of my greatest game visions where I have wanted to play a game in this exact setting for pretty much my whole life. The tropics and island hopping  shipwreck exploring  sinking feeling when being hunted by nature... All of this is part of this huge desire to play a game like this since I was a kid.

3352934,0,t1_cpacm6a,If you read the Steam Forums theyve actually spoken of the issue at hand.  Theyre correcting a number of things on the backend and looking at hiring additional team members.  Basically theyre spending the next two month getting themselves into a position where they can make the drastic changes and updates theyd like to do.Presumably this means a dedicated raft system improved water physics nightday cycles and the like.I dont think they were prepared for the swell in support and they quickly realized that in order to implement some of the things people are clamoring for they need to overhaul the underlying code and get more people on the team.,strandeddeep,cpagjf5,3,t5_2xcvr

4325931,0,t3_3aje5n,Id wait. I bought it and played for a couple hours till there was nothing left to do. Now it collects dust waiting for more content.,strandeddeep,csd9f27,7,t5_2xcvr
4337247,0,t1_csej5wv,Well..for starters theres a wiki that covers a lot of this stuff. I spent a ton of hours in the game flipping back to it to look stuff up.I dont think Im really any means an expert. I mostly bought this game because of the utter curiosity...and got hopelessly addicted. OF course I needed a way to break that so I installed a few mods that basically allow you to take all the challenge out of the game...and sadly this is a game that once you do that at least in its current state doesnt stay addictive.I have however played around with the game using cheats in various ways. Falling from high enough in to the water can not only cause bleeding bandage level bleeding but can also break bones and kill you instantly. You can go for km in any direction and just hit more islands. Theres nothing at the bottom of the deepsea. Sharks are dicks. Theres an AK somewhere in the game thats totally badass. Stingrays surprisingly cant kill you and are totally useless. But I had no clue what was going on the first  hours or so I put in the game...why was I ill...why was i feeling strange...how do I stop from dying in those cases...I still fool around with it...Ive begun to appreciate the game as a simple...yet massive exploration survival game with a hint of crafting though I sometimes get fustrated at the crafting system. But no I basically cheat at this game now...the same way I cheated at every game...because hey...I bought it...thats how I want to play it.,strandeddeep,csejd1a,1,t5_2xcvr
4338554,0,t1_csek23m,There is a paddling glitch that allows you to double or triple paddle. You begin paddling and while holding the paddle button you hit escape mid paddle to go to the menu. Continuing to hold down the paddle button you hit escape again to go back to the game. Now you quickly release the paddle button and press it down again. You should see the animation change and hear double paddle sounds. You can continue doing this multiple times...adding so many strokes to each one so doing it  times would move you x as fast  times x the problem is its a glitch and you become unstable in the raft and are at risk of being launched out.,strandeddeep,cseonrw,1,t5_2xcvr
4356260,0,t3_3avw0c,I..uhh...I use TierMod It provides a live minimap in the game as well as a larger map. Its nowhere near as detailed as what Stranded Deep Mapper looked like it could provide it never worked for me it will show you the locations of shipwrecks and plane crashes. The map updates automatically in realtime as you cross each biome. The larger map will show you the distances and bearings between you and whatever island you hover over...plus you can rightclick to warp there if you want to play that way. I obviously do...but I enjoy screwing with the game engine and game just to see how some of this gameplay could turn out.If you resist the temptation to use the warp you can just pretend you came equipped with an invincible everlasting GPS unit...since all these flashlights and lanterns still work forever despite years underwater. ,strandeddeep,csgomdj,5,t5_2xcvr

5641623,0,t3_3re01y,Stranded deep will be a good game but like many people seem not to understand that early alpha means  years before you can play it they hate on the game and the devs.Stranded Deep is a great game but it will take some more time before its ready. Like most other good early access games they suck before they are finished but if you like how they are done youll enjoy them even if they arent finished yet. Biggest issue with Stranded Deep is that they have go figure out ways to solve gameplay mechanics. Some will work first try. Most probably wont. Like with any Early access game they will revisit certain aspects and it will be a slow process. If you enjoy following that process its a good game. If you dont care for the process but only want to play the finished game dont buy it. ,strandeddeep,cwwebl6,1,t5_2xcvr
