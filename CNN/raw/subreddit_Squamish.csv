8238210,0,t1_d576gpp,Im not sure they are falling yet  I know that every listing in the last  months seemed to be testing new highs I think listings that came on the market with too lofty of expectations are having to drop their price. Tons of listings lately have dropped their price but I am talking from .m down to .m in the highlands and k down to  ish in valley cliff. Valley cliff is solidly in the k range garibaldi highlands are m and new houses by Brennan park are k.  Where bouts is your friend selling and what was the starting price before he reduced it?,Squamish,d57byuk,1,t5_2tmy9
