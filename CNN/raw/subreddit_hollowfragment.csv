4739799,0,t3_3fiphe,My brother and I went into multiplayer and we had yet to beat a floor boss. Just make sure you pick a quest thats low level. It will state what level it recommends. We didnt have much of a problem killing anything. Also a great way to level up your partners!,hollowfragment,ctrzv9a,1,t5_339ez

Im still just a total noob but any info would be helpful DEDIT should mentioned I am playing on the ps does unlocking OSS differ between the two systems?,hollowfragment,cvqgy9p,1,t5_339ez
8989086,0,t3_501ga1,So this will come with a grain of salt as my experience is from ps vs vita.On ps I mained h sword and once it hit  I switched to h sword. Still transitioning. h sword seems behind but Im hoping h makes up for it. Its slow kind of annoying. On vita I stuck with dual wield. It felt stronger than h at any point.I also tried spear for a bit on ps and it was okay if the allies did more damage Id enjoy it but it took forever so my utility from spear felt useless. I feel like if youre not playing a sword youre filming yourself. On PS I feel dual wield gt h gt h is the way to go. I havent seen katana or scimitar but from what I understand Katana was the best on vita because of the skill chains.,hollowfragment,d7sclu1,1,t5_339ez
