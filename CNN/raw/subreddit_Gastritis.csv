9845253,0,t1_daqujgy,I live in a small place. Before I was diagnosed I went to couple of doctors and every doctor told me something else. The doctors where I live arent very good. Shipping here will cost me a lot I will look if they sell those here thanks. I will try to get some sleeping pills so when I get bad I will use them to sleep and get better. Cause it already takes me  hours to sleep with gastritis its worse.,Gastritis,daquy6x,1,t5_2we8l
10341119,0,t3_5n1qqy,more water! or non acidic juices. Or just flavor your water with blueberries or peach or something. Some people can handle teas. I cant handle even chamomile.Funny that one blessing out of the nightmare of gastritis is that Ive become very intune with my diet and made changes that Ill likely keep even if my stomach were to heal. Drinking lots and lots of water is one of them.,Gastritis,dcg83q5,1,t5_2we8l
10680490,0,t1_ddhirus,Interesting I may go back to this at some point. Perhaps with . gram per dose and see how I go. But not at the moment as Im currently testing BPC from today which looks very promising in the literature. ,Gastritis,ddhm11g,1,t5_2we8l
10803449,0,t1_ddua2tf,Also I will add that stomach has been feeling awesome as in I barely feel it anymore. But BPC  has done nothing for my GERD so far still as bad as ever esp when sleeping. I have a small hiatal hernia which Im sure contributes to that and would make sense that its not something that needs healing and instead needs to be adjusted down with massage techniques.,Gastritis,dduasno,1,t5_2we8l
10991395,0,t1_de7tc0v, days in. No white flecks in my stool for the past  days it was there for at least a week. I dont know what that was. Hopefully just mucus due to healing inflammation. Today sucks though. I have that gut punch feeling all day long. I havent had that feeling in quite a while.Im on my second bottle of BPC . This one is from a different supplier. In edit I think the flecks were from the yogurt. Historically if I had too much dairy I would get diarrhea but that went away years ago. Maybe this who gastritis thing is about lactose intolerance for me. Im going to bail on dairy for a bit which sucks because I love my cheese but... if it fixes this crazy gastritis Ill never look back.,Gastritis,dedu8rl,1,t5_2we8l
11610964,0,t1_dgc13si,Im awaiting a specialist nsaids worked but ultimately gave me gastritis. Paracetamol is  ok for now.,Gastritis,dgc42qn,1,t5_2we8l
