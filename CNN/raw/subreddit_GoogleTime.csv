If we can place our known history in perspective for mass consumption it could change the essence of how we understand our very existence and give our collective consciousness a fresh perspective.Im pretty excited by this idea and hope it comes to realization!Be ready to be challenged by a number of people however especially in regards to religious and political dates and narratives. To avoid trouble maybe instead of only aiming for a single or true timeline you could implement the layered approach and require that people source it according to X source in  BC this happened. etc. You wouldnt need to counter one claim against another just layer them and then analyze the results. Our understanding of history is fluid and unfortunately incomplete in many areas so I think its important to take that into account.I would hope that by literally just placing all the dots on an interactive timeline with all the information we would be surprised by realizations that we had never considered before or be able to discount certain theories and question certain understandings.I also think its important to highlight the nuances and disagreements between scientists historians existing theories contested theories etc. which will help highlight where the need for further research lays but I feel that this should maybe come as a second step once the information is entered? You could literally highlight the contested information from the overlapping layers or something and add an explanation.Just throwing ideas around take and leave what you see fit!!I picture this as not only a timeline but a literal amalgamation of all human knowledge theories suppositions and physical evidence into a visualized format based on the timeline..and not only from a single school or even a state but from the whole world! And for everyone to analyze...what a time to be alive! ,GoogleTime,cvfjp33,2,t5_3a3ee

If you scrape Wikipedia for events then youd pretty much have to manually tag or add some sort of categorization to every single event.Another more automated method would be to use the topics Wikipedia already has. Upside is this would simply mean scraping more data automatically. Downside would be that not every event for a date would necessarily show up in these categories. Check out this page as an example ,GoogleTime,cvgdrwx,1,t5_3a3ee
