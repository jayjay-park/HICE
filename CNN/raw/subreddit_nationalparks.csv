1394920,0,t3_2a2fy7,Why does this need to be stopped?This is private land.  What is the benefit of private land if the government is going to tell me what I can and cannot do on it.If the NPS really wants to prevent this they should lease the land from the Indians this way they get some money for their useless land that the US Government forced on them and the NPS gets their unobstructed views.P.S. Unless they build a skyscraper the views will not be impacted at all.  Ive been there to both sides of the canyon this wouldnt bother me in the slightest.,nationalparks,cir4u6r,0,t5_2rjgo
2313203,0,t3_2lrrtl,At this point I have been to most of the parks heres some insight.Analyze the clusters of parks and time required to visit each one.  Dont let the goal of visiting every park mean that you are just breezing through that would be no fun.  Some parks can be strung together really nicely.  For instance  Yellowstone and Teton  Zion Bryce Grand Canyon Capitol Reef Arches Canyonlands  Sequioia Kings Canyon Yosemite could add in Joshua Tree and Death Valley  Redwoods Crater Lake Lassen  Isle Royale VoyageursIf you generally have a week to travel you can plan on how much driving versus park time you want.  You can easily spend a week in some parks and not seedo everything Yosemite while others can be done in a day or two Pinnacles.Dont try to visit Rainier Olympic and North Cascades in a week that would be more like a rushed two week trip.By far the hardest parks will be up in Alaska especially the noncoastal ones Gates of the Arctic.  You will either have to plan an epic Alaska trip like ulordxeon or make multiple trips there.My other suggestion is to spend some time researching other cool things around the parks and not just visit the National Parks.  There is a ton of great National Monuments State Parks and other land agencies to visit if you are going all that way might as well expand your scope a bit.,nationalparks,clxml7b,4,t5_2rjgo

3161009,0,t3_2wc4qf,Why not try to spend more time but in fewer parks? You could easily spend your whole time in any of these parks with day trips you risk missing out on all the park has to offer. If I were you I would start with Kenai Fjords hike the Harding Icefield Trail and then either go sea kayaking or take a glacier cruise. Then drive up to Denali and spend a few days to a week hiking around the backcountry. Its pretty cheap to take a bus in and if you are comfortable backpacking no guide is needed. After that a fly in backcountry trip to Gates or Lake Clark would help round out your trip. ,nationalparks,copmxqw,2,t5_2rjgo

3411368,0,t3_2yzdr5,The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is much less crowded than the South Rim and also a bit more accessible for your general range of itinerary.  Its cooler in an amazing smelling forest and as a bonus on the way to and from you get two national monuments Pipe Spring and Vermillion Cliffs.  A special note about the cliffs try to hit them during a rain as they are incredibly lovely.  Also dont be afraid to check out the various state parks while you are in that neck of the woods.  Coral Pink Sand Dunes is right around the corner from the North Rim and Zion and is definitely a fun side trip. ,nationalparks,cph4d8u,1,t5_2rjgo
3635203,0,t1_cq6mnr6,Big Bend is a pretty big NP in Southern Texas. Lots of steep breathtaking canyons and in the spring theres so many wildflowers that you can smell them from your car. All sorts of wildlife as well roadrunners and stuff. Its also super cool if youve never seen the Rio Grande before I hadnt. We also had a mountain lion pass through camp. I just got back a couple of weeks ago was going to post an album of my trip on here so keep your eyes open if youre curious! I had also never been to TX before. ,nationalparks,cq6n2qe,3,t5_2rjgo

9258967,0,t3_576cyb,I spent two days in Saguaro NP last December.  One day in each section.  I didnt go on any long hikes mostly stayed from what I could get to from the road.  Theres plenty to do from the road in both parts.  If you want to really go into the mountains of the Rincon district youll have to do some serious hiking I dont think any of it is back country but you will need a permit if youre going to stay overnight.As far as things to do in each park I think that the Rincon district had better sunset views honestly and thats a paved road which is much nicer to drive on in the dark.  The dirtgravel road in the Tuscon Mountain District is very drivable in an ordinary car dont worry about that.There are some beautiful cacti up Picture Rocks Road that face East that you can get some beautiful sun rise photos with.  Unfortunately the the park roads dont officially open until sunrise or am I forget.My PhotosHave a good trip!,nationalparks,d8pn33f,2,t5_2rjgo
9268982,0,t1_d8qsd1l,Downtown is basically centered around Congress St and th Ave. I recommend strolling Congress St in either direction from there.Also  you can head east on Congress under the overpass onto th Ave. th Ave has a ton of great stuff from there up to th St or University Blvd.From th Ave amp University Blvd  you can head east if you feel like strolling more. Its residential for a few blocks then theres another batch of stuff from Euclid to Park Ave.The streetcar also runs this route though its not far at all to walk it. Each spot Downtown th Ave University has a TON of restaurants and the shops are mostly along th Ave  including a bookstore or two!,nationalparks,d8qwr8r,2,t5_2rjgo

If youre spending a few days in Arches you can make camp there and go to the Island in the Sky District as a day trip. Even spending a few hours there is worth it its breathtaking.,nationalparks,dd3oqm6,2,t5_2rjgo
