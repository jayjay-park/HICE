726620,0,t1_cgmv6jg,Super chill! Thats sweet man. I loved the panning throughout the song really unique! I thought the panning with the sub got a little excessivedistracting at points. The sub breaks were on point but maybe add a little more reverb to your subs so its not so sudden? I like your vocal sample just turn it up a bit! Maybe try adding some subtle quiet double time high hats or percussion elements to really set it off! Good job though man!!,futurebeatproducers,cgmvch1,1,t5_2t5r3

766442,0,t1_cgr30aq,True. Than I would definitely do some research on things like hifilofi decks decks that are warm vs. pretty uncolored tape track width and learning about the actual type of tape youre recording onto Cassette or RR before you actually start jumping to the first deck you find in your budget.There is a TON of stuff to learn about and unlike a lot people think tape isnt some magic power that automatically turns your music into that warm analog fuzzy sound youre after. It DOES give it a unique and audibly different sound and depending on the qualitycondition of your tape decktapes it can be anywhere from subtle to completely mangled but shitty processing and mastering will still sound shitty no matter how good of a tape deck youre using.,futurebeatproducers,cgreec9,1,t5_2t5r3

1137019,0,t1_chxf39v,Cool vocals nice tempo. Not a fan of the beat too predictable for my taste and the samples need some filters and effects to make them less generic. Oh and try introducing a long subbass when the climax kicks in.,futurebeatproducers,chxiwrk,1,t5_2t5r3

Im not  sure if its trap... i think i just tagged it that cause most of my earlier stuff was attempts at trap... haha.  Again thank you so much for listening!,futurebeatproducers,ci2g84t,1,t5_2t5r3
1214967,0,t1_ci6aamf,Yea I resample quite a bit. Ableton has the nifty tool to freeze and flatten MIDI tracks quite quickly. A lot of the time I will resample a synth and pitch the audio clip up or down so it has a different timbre than just changing octave. And sometimes Ill layer that onto the original synth so it is more full.Pitching up and messing around with filter lfos and different reverbs is fun. Occasionally Ill use flanger on my chain for more movement etc. A lot of the time I will do the reverb spacializing on one layer of a synth to give it more width in the background while still having mono elements that keep it in the foreground.One thing that was fun that I did recently was take a sample of short melody of a bunch of high chimy sounding blips. I put that in a sampler and play it lower so it would be slow and stretched. And I played it in a chord so that the different timings and pitches could dance around each other. Then froze flattened that and picked out samples from the various parts that sounded good. Did a little warping so that they would be more in time and added effects after that.,futurebeatproducers,ci6aw7m,3,t5_2t5r3

1354836,0,t1_cim2ts1,yes indeed i have reeverb on there and i am aware of the kick drum being on the forefront of the mix. however in this song the reeverb was a stylistic choice because i wanted this muddy fuzzyambient kind of feel. thanks for the analysis man and glad you liked the track!,futurebeatproducers,cim4bbb,1,t5_2t5r3
1451684,0,t1_ciy8kqm,Basically your track has an awesome sound to it but it feels a little empty. Fuller dynamic range means trying to fill out the audial spectrum from the lows to the highs with sounds.I found that when I started producing I wasnt compressing anything I wasnt mastering anything. I was simply producing the sounds maybe tweaking the volume of each track and adding reverb or something and then exporting the track as finished. This lead to songs without much dynamic range.Its hard to go into a ton of detail since I am still an amateur at it all myself but searching for Youtube tutorials on mastering EQing and sidechaining will be a very helpful start.,futurebeatproducers,ciy8slc,1,t5_2t5r3

1525001,0,t1_ciw3d45,This was a lovely read thanks for your words! As someone who generally gets close to no attention when it comes to my music this was really enjoyable. As far as the cinnamon goes you can see it as a stab at the music industry and the way people too easily get lost in trying to create something that will be appreciated rather than good. I am a huge fan of the s idmscene and love artists such as RDJ Amon Tobin etc. and so it is also used kinda like a tribute to that scene. If you were a  year old guy named Ronny listening to hardcoredanceedmstep you probably wouldnt hear the break but since you know about it you do. I guess it might become overwhelming but when i made it i didnt think so. Thanks again for your lovely commentary made my day!,futurebeatproducers,cj7fpav,1,t5_2t5r3

1559019,0,t1_cjbombg,yeah man sorry i didnt elaborate. something just feels kinda funky. you either have the keys of the vocals and the chords mismatched or you have them right and there are just some notes in those chords that dont fit. if you know your scales just take an instrument piano guitar or a synth and just find some notes in the vocals and figure out what scale they fall within. other than that your production techniques are pretty groovy man. keep it up. ,futurebeatproducers,cjbp2wd,2,t5_2t5r3

1566851,0,t1_cjcfrfz,Yoooooo this sounds like something Pharrell would have done for In My Mind amp Pharrell is like my idol so that says a lot to me. The only thing I can suggest is some more diversity with the sample arrangement like switching it up every four bars or so if that makes any sense. The drums could maybe use some subtle diversity every now amp then but other than that the beat is perfect. Great job,futurebeatproducers,cjcofey,1,t5_2t5r3

I just processed the hell out of it and automated the sequencing a few times throughout to make it feel a little sampleesque lol. The gamey vocal samples though are from an N Pack I found a while back.

1858467,0,t1_ckd3kyn,I like the ambiance youve created with all the bells and tremolo keyboard stuff  works really well. One thing Im kind of missing is maybe something like percussion that could add an extra rhythmic dynamic and fill out the mix and give the song more of a shape. Little breakdown at  and the end sound killer  good work!,futurebeatproducers,ckd52bx,2,t5_2t5r3
1895424,0,t1_ckhin1q,This is very clean and technical. I feel like played on a loud system it would really go off but at the same time for just casual listening I feel like the energy would be lost. I dont know how to describe it better than that so I hope it makes sense. The mix is very on point. The kick is really nice. All of the technical parts of this track are up to par... But I feel like maybe its too clean and too like straight of a track maybe some swing or something would set it off. Nice track though really enjoyed it!,futurebeatproducers,ckhl7qm,1,t5_2t5r3

On the flume tutorial though none of the elements are in key with eachother  dont really flow that well together nor does it sound like a flume style song in any respect No offence. The next time you want to do an artist style tutorial I suggest you actually remake synths they have used in their songs and then show how to make those patches in your tutorials in the context of the song youre creating in the tutorial.,futurebeatproducers,cmb7pu4,2,t5_2t5r3

I dont know if I just didnt notice it before or if you added it now but I really love the subtle vocals hanging over everything.I dont know it might just be me but I feel like that huge moog lead youve got could use some reverb just to make it feel a little more analog not sure if theres some sidechaining going on but maybe put somepump it up a little?But overall very very nice dude.,futurebeatproducers,cmbdjf5,1,t5_2t5r3

3764144,0,t1_cql6a6u,Its can definitely help to have a reference point for your levels whether that be the kick snare bass or whatever. When I started out I would religiously make sure my kick peaked at dB and balance everything from there. Now I dont think about it in that way. The more you do it the more your ears and intuition will improve  I can trust my instinct to tell me when things arent sitting right and make little tweaks as I go as I was doing with the encoders at the top of the Push in this video.Couple of other volume related tips do all your volume automation on the gain dial of a Utility that way you can still use the tracks volume fader to balance it relative to other channels when the master is running a little too hot grab all your audio and MIDI channels and bring them down by a few dB  dont turn down the master fader as this is essentially reducing the bit depth and therefore audio quality of your project. if youre struggling to set the level of a given part turn its fader down all the way start the track shut your eyes and begin to gradually move the fader up until it sounds right. Open your eyes and write down the level of the fader. Now repeat the process starting with the fader all the way up and gradually turning it down. Find the average of the two numbers you wrote down and set your fader there. This works best with your monitors fairly quiet.In terms of kick amp bass do you mean designing good kick and bass patches or do you mean getting them to sit well together?,futurebeatproducers,cqlc9xr,2,t5_2t5r3

3949202,0,t1_cr68cgf,I had this problem throughout  years Ive been producing. What Im trying to do now when I sit to write a new track is I select a tempo press play and imagine what I will hear in the track from start to finish. I write it down using empty midi channels with track and clip names.After that I start writing and initial structure serves as a plan of what I need to do. I still end up changing the arrangement significantly in the process and the result sounds nothing like what I imagined but its better to have a bad plan than not to have any.,futurebeatproducers,cr6fyh6,7,t5_2t5r3

3998915,0,t3_36a5yz,I made this plugin because I see a lot of people asking on various production subs how to easily turn mono sounds stereo.  Often the advice in response is to make two copies of the original track pan one left and the other right and delay one a bit.  This works well because of the precedence effect also known as the Haas effect and sounds great so long as the source remains stereo.  However collapsing the result back into mono effect creates a comb filter drastically changing the sound of the track. ,futurebeatproducers,crc3wjv,7,t5_2t5r3

With the drums make sure they are parallel compressed so the drums feel even with each other. I think in terms of the vocal it needs to be wider try mid side eq you can use the ableton eq  to do this or if you have a better eq which has mid side then do that also high pass the vocals but not to the point where it the lower layered vocal is gone.

I thought it was in  time until the arp and hats came in in  at . Nice play between straight and triplet time well triplet time if the whole tune is actually in  anyway!.Im not sure how I feel about the arp  theres nothing particularly wrong with the sound or the notes it plays but Im just not too convinced that it fits in with the feel you cooked up in the first half of the track.

6019034,0,t3_3xwbcb,Youre on the right track. I would suggest compressing the hell out of it after the reverb. Effects like this usually sit back in the mix and dont necessarily need a heavy dynamic range. Try putting a low pass after the compressor as suggested in the other comments as well. Be conscious not to cloud up the low end of the mix with this effect as it might interfere with the accompanying instruments. You might find you can roll off some of the low end and still get the same power.,futurebeatproducers,cy8mcii,1,t5_2t5r3

6356235,0,t3_42pnrr,There is tons of future beats that people can dance to. If they dont allow this in a bar or club then they must be insane. Future music combines elements of clubdancehouse plus other electronic genres which can definitely be played in a live setting. Not only that but Future is a superior genre to anything out right now because of how versatile it is a lot of its versatility comes from the elements of trap music it takes from. You can take it from chill all the way to the best club bangers.I would do a meetup group to see if anyone is actually interested in getting together to listen to this kind of music if you get enough people at the meetup then you know you can do something with it. From there expand into barsclubsetc. Hit up all the college campuses and just hand out flyers or post them up on bulletins that they have in the schools. ,futurebeatproducers,czc4u3g,1,t5_2t5r3

6411549,0,t3_43i2vk,You dont necessarily need to use decapitator on every . Not every  will sound good with it. So the first thing is to determine if it even needs decapitator. If its making it sound airy then try separating the low and high end of the  and saturate only the high end and then combine it with the low end. This is usually helpful in getting nice  sound.Also decapitator has filters and a tone knob. Try going for a darker tone. And choose a tape emulation at the bottom where it says A E N T P. Cycle through those and see which one sounds best these buttons alone will COMPLETELY transfrom the sound,futurebeatproducers,cziffwa,1,t5_2t5r3

I think maybe placing a kick where the bass comes in on every measure would help the bass hit harder. Or create a fast pitch envelope for the bass with a really fast decay to simulate a kick sound at the beginning of your bass.

No one here has mentioned the fact that you dont have a soundcard. You need to get an interface they are way cheaper than buying a new pc. Thats a UK site but it gives you an idea of what to search and how low the prices are compared to a new laptop.

7834694,0,t3_4mhenf,The others have covered you up pretty well. look for a studio acapella And if not then your life will get much more complicated Ill try to list the steps you COULD take to try and get to your music but again you might be better off just looking for another acapella.. Use Maximus to kill the instrumentsThis wont be perfect youll have to find the frequency range the musician is on... and hope to god they dont have an annoying instrument bleeding into their voice on the same frequency but this tends not to happen well thats depending on Genre. If you pull this off right itll sound like the musician and the instrumental are separated by a wall of sorts. Itll be useful for perhaps keeping the rhyme when you go back and produce over it but.... Find the instrumental version and try to invert it only to track to cancel the music.Thats only happened well for me ONCE. But at the very least youll have a very watered down version of the song that will be easy to string instruments on top of. . Do steps  and  together... Instrumentals dont usually match the exact song. So you get some fuzzy ghosts of the song.. If youre lucky and get a clean mix with  or  then pat yourself on the back. But if you dont you can try ...  first then go back and pick .After wards you can use an EQ to bend the sections of the voice you want to be loudersofter to kill some of the residual effects. Also you can apparently use some Stereo separation techniques here to help out?... I wont pretend to know how stereo separation afterwards can help solidify your DYI acapella but Mentioning it should give you something to google if you want to go down that route.. Just ask around. This sounds dumb but if you have a small community of producer friends as long as the song you want isnt super obscure theres always that guy who can mix the acapella or knows a website that might have it. ,futurebeatproducers,d3wor80,1,t5_2t5r3

I started piano  months ago guitar a couple of years ago ukulele too and bass recently. Its hella fun to learn instruments and you dont need much other than YouTube and patienceOh and also octaves!

8107573,0,t3_4q7g2i,Im a stickler for my sounds so I EQ everything into place as Im going along slap on my sidechains and parallel compressors etc. Then I mix everything down making sure nothing is overpowering each other and that the vocal track cuts straight through the mix. Then I throw it into Landr. Landr will bring up the volume levels and add slight saturation. Ive noticed that if you have a really solid mix down and all your levels are in the right place then Landr will make your mix on the same loudness level as standard production songs.

9106972,0,t3_5508qu,Honestly it would probably fall under the whole future bass genre thing. Personally I think naming all these genres is pointless. This song seems to have some trap elements some flume elements and just all around groove and swing. Ya theres a lot of sidechain and sweeping automation. Maybe look up some tutorials on creating groove and maybe doing some flumeesque stuff? I would also personally say dont waste so much time trying to copy a genre.

9669984,0,t1_da510zg,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,futurebeatproducers,da5113b,3,t5_2t5r3

10508214,0,t1_dcxv4nr,Cloud rap enthusiast? First things first this sounds a lot better than my st track. Agree that the kick is a little flat. The bass is also way too loud in the mix. I get the sense that its supposed to be front and center but right now its sat on top of the mix completely overwhelming what you got going on beneath.My personal recommendation  would be lowering the volume on it and widening it the fuck out into stereo. Listen to the mix with it like that then add some saturation to the bass and slowly notch it up. Filling out this frequency range will give you loudness but still allow your percussion to POP.Also I cant really tell if youve got a light sidechain to the bass from the kick? If you have I think you could notch it up just a little to give the boot of the kick more presence. You should be able to do that without having the bass sound like its ducking out constantly if thats not the sound youre going for.Anyway I definitely think youre on the right track overall just gotta keep on going. ,futurebeatproducers,dcz7u0h,1,t5_2t5r3

10784727,0,t1_dds7nbz,Tracks got a great vibe to it. Water samples and ambiance in the beginning is nice. Really like the vocal chops. I think the intro might be a bit too long it takes a while before the beat starts really going. But when it does its pretty tight. ,futurebeatproducers,ddsd6u5,1,t5_2t5r3
10800495,0,t1_ddtsbth,agreed the intro is really beautiful.  love the vocals and the bass along with the percussion.  the lead is a bit harsh like rory said maybe try automating it around with a lowpass filter inside of the synth and i also strongly agree that during the build it seems like the instruments are fighting for space but then the drop comes in and its a bit cleaner but i still feel like theyre competing instead of feeding off of each other.  also woulda enjoyed a different snare sample but overall i really enjoyed the atmosphere.,futurebeatproducers,ddtzsvl,1,t5_2t5r3

10988496,0,t3_5wx5xt,Hey there.This is beat .Need some feedback on the mix it didnt end up coming off the way I wanted but wondering if its still good.Also need some tips on making my tracks sound fuller. When I compare my tracks to more experienced producers theirs always have this sense of fullness while mine sound like theres space that could be filled up. How do I get that fullness?Returning all feedback!,futurebeatproducers,dedieyl,1,t5_2t5r3
11007475,0,t1_def8eq6,the first percussion in intro sounds like someone hitting a can against a table I like it. I also like the group banging their hands on the table sound at around . switching up the perc adds some volume to a track and isnt done too often IME. I also like the faint synths around  and then the hard attack  delay on the higher synths starting at .pretty cool followed my tracks below if you want to collab!Heres mine if you wish to return. ,futurebeatproducers,defo04a,1,t5_2t5r3
11016483,0,t1_defu48f,Thx for the feedback man. Def going to keep that in mind for future tracks. I need to switch up my melodies to have structure and parts that link up. Thanks again man. Hit me with one of your tracks. ,futurebeatproducers,degorew,1,t5_2t5r3
11025534,0,t3_5xbdl6,Yo dude  I see you around a lot and have always been a huge fan. Big fan of all the BampL allstars. Question for you and I guess a broader question.Why dont trap packs include midi most nontrap packs limit their midi inclusion? Do people feel its too simple? Is midi discouraged? Why dont you personally include midi in your packs? Im super curious on this one. Im not a trained musician and midi helps me formulate new ideas  I can take it and turn it into anything Id like. Its like clay and I get to mold it into my own creation. I can even mix and match pieces rearrange them cut notes out add my own etc. you get the idea.That being said it just seems like the least important or least touched upon sample pack piece and I think it offers the most room for experimentation.,futurebeatproducers,dehpre5,2,t5_2t5r3

11174699,0,t1_deyke7p,Aye thank you so much for that feedback cause you mentioned exactly what i was looking for! Im very glad the vocals sit good within the mix and the beat is not too overwhelming while maintaining some punch ,futurebeatproducers,deyn1fx,1,t5_2t5r3
11175567,0,t1_deynjg0,Not my cup a tea but def worth a mention.,futurebeatproducers,deyqkus,1,t5_2t5r3
11256457,0,t1_df7p7gc,I would Probably recommend the Novation Mininova purely because the features are far more extensive. Features like wavetables an extra oscillator and larger FX chain. Ill admit that the Mininova isnt as warm but that can be fixed with minor tweaking. I think overall it is a better buy.If you dont mind spending more money you could also get a Roland JDXi. This is an amazing synth for the price. The only downside is are its looks.,futurebeatproducers,df7whuo,2,t5_2t5r3

11419689,0,t3_630r7x,Snowsprings DemoI whipped this track up yesterday and this is the first track Ive produced where I felt like I knew what I was doing when mixing it  but thats still probably not the case.

11587691,0,t1_dg9f236,hey man i dig what you were going for but i feel like you overdid it a bit with the vocal sample. Maybe Id add some effects like a little reverb on the lead or something and maybe some hihats to complete the drums. Just my opinion though . Cheers keep doing your thing!Heres my lil project if you feel like listening,futurebeatproducers,dg9h058,1,t5_2t5r3
11633735,0,t1_dgeg9fw,its good. i like how spacey it is and the vocals are great. idk how but since the vocals are obviously the main focus here you can prob add fx or do something to make it punch more. overall its clean and good. not much to complain about.,futurebeatproducers,dgep2xw,1,t5_2t5r3
11670665,0,t1_dgiv9y5,Really interesting stuff man. If I had to give any criticism Id say try using some white noise build ups or just more build ups in general to keep the tension up and keep the listener excited. Changing up small things in the drumsmelody to also make things more exciting. Keep at it  ,futurebeatproducers,dgivw7x,1,t5_2t5r3

11747824,0,t1_dgqipby,You are a fucking soundsmith. Those synths sound immaculate Id love to hear more about how you synthesized them. Looking really forward to a sample pack if you find the time. I know this is a work in progress so I might be nitpicking something that you have already fixed but right before the drums exit it sounds like you have an extra measure in there thats throwing me off. I think you can move the soloed snare hit and everything after it exactly one measure back and it will conform better to the established structure.,futurebeatproducers,dgrn8m2,1,t5_2t5r3
