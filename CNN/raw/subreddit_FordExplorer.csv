3156913,0,t3_2vxhex,Mine is a  x XLT.  Besides the transmissions that WILL need rebuilt or replaced the rest of it I love.  The damn thing is my personal Hillbilly Humvee.  With proper allterrain tires the son of a bitch goes anywhere.  Ive tried to get it stuck but the son of a bitch just digs in and pulls out every damn time.I had to rebuild my transmission at k miles.  At around k I had to replace a couple wheel bearings to have both put in cost me about  total.  I still have something whining in the front end and so I think Im going to need another wheel bearing or maybe a couple cv axles on the front end.  I havent taken the time to figure out which just yet.  It could also use new suspension at this point but it has over k miles on it so thats to be expected.Oh and around k miles I had to replace the idler pulley.  Also one more thing.  Mine is white and I barely have any damn paint left on the roof of mine.I have to say again the x in mine is fucking awesome!  The transmission WILL go though.  If it hasnt already just plan after the k mark to be rebuilding or replacing that.Mine is my daily driver.  It gets about  mpg around town and around  if its all Interstate driving.I have a friend who owns a  with k miles and his transmission is starting to go as well.  He also always comments on how much better mine looks than his strictly aesthetically of course.  His is also white and his paint has flaked and started peeling off in large patches as well.  I dont know what it is with Fords white paint but keep in mind it fucking sucks.I would probably buy it again because I love the room it has mine has third row seats which when laid down most of the time give me plenty of rear cargo space but can give me two extra seats when needed for extra kids and again I love the x in it.  But Id make sure to have your own mechanic look it over good first and tell you what to expect especially if it has k or more miles.  ,FordExplorer,cop7mpk,1,t5_2vvuy

5805545,0,t3_3umaqg,There are drain tubes for the sunroof that get cloggedunhooked over time allowing water to pool up or leak straight into the cabin instead of drain normally.  Id start with finding these to fix the problem.,FordExplorer,cxgqe1k,1,t5_2vvuy
6758976,0,t3_489aoj,What kind of leak? Fuel? Oil? Coolant? Is the leak starting right when you tap the key or does it take a while to start?  Does the engine also take a while to start?Go somewhere to get the codes checked or do yourself a favor and buy an OBD reader.  I have a Bluetooth reader that I got from Amazon for about  bucks.Also a post with the title Yikes! Please read should have wayyyy more info to help you out.

9027122,0,t3_52a55x,Shoot just run it until doesnt want to run anymore. I had a  Sport and ran it to  miles and still had more than enough life left in it. It definitely had its little annoyances. It had this issue with the tailgate where the glass part would rattle like no other. Just turned the radio up louder and it went away. I dont know how much you could get for it if you sell it but I wouldnt figure much. I sold my Sport for . I currently have an  Sport Trac which which has some issues but it still runs. Rear main seal leak is the big one. Drops bits of oil here and there but until it finally stops running or when I find a replacement  vehicle Ill keep running it. The garage wants close to a grand for the repair but screw that. Theyre great trucks. My first car was a  Explorer and have loved them ever since.   ,FordExplorer,d7wx2hh,1,t5_2vvuy

11064818,0,t1_dem647x,The squeal is your belt or a pulley Im guessing. Inspect your belt if its bad go buy a new one. If it doesnt look terrible disengage the tensioner and remove the belt. Inspect it then check all of the pulleys to make sure they spin freely and dont make any noise or get stuck. ,FordExplorer,dem6qc9,1,t5_2vvuy
