738278,0,t1_cgnv3ki,I still think the difference between Gladbachs and Wolfsburgs chances are not as big as displayed. They were pretty close to each other during the whole season there just isnt much of a difference in quality between those teams even though Wolfsburg has the bigger names like Kevin De Bruyne or Luiz Gustavo.I still agree Wolfsburgs chances are higher.

2062681,0,t3_2ifyqs,I am not the biggest fan of Borussia Dortmund so this might be a biased opinion. But trust me I know a die hard fan of the team who agrees with me.The biggest problem the BVB has are the unusual amount of injured stars. I do not know how Jrgen Klopp coaches the team but normally this should not be that big of a problem. With  players in the team and  injured this leaves Klopp with more than enough players to compete. Dortmund has always had a strong first team but their reserve players could never really deliver.The other problem I see with Dortmund is the fact that it seems they cannot play equally well in the Bundesliga and in international tournaments. I do not know why this is the case and it baffles many die hard fans I know. And as far as I know the BVB is the only german team that has this problem.But like I said do not take this post to seriously as I dont really like the BVB.,Bundesliga,cl20frg,6,t5_2s82y

4603105,0,t1_ctasvbc,no i didnt ignore your whole point we just have very different understandings of how the market works.    where du you think the PL is getting the money from? england? ahahaahaha. england is getting the tv money because their are marketing their league internationally since decades they are huge outside of england.    you just keep talkin about the german fans and keep ignoring the facts. german fans hinder the league to evolve further because they keep crying about traditions mocking clubs like hoffenheim  wolfsburg  rb leipzig etc. instead of supporting them.    if you want your league to be succesfull nowadays you need to market your league outside your own country and thats only possible if you have a successfull league internationally because those teams draw attention outside of germany.    so no they wont lose a ton of money if they keep replacing the big clubs with the big following with some plastic clubs no one gives a shit about they will only lose a ton of money from german fans because they are to stubborn to adapt.    the big money isnt in germany you have to think global which is pretty clear that you are too narrow minded to do so.,Bundesliga,ctat47n,1,t5_2s82y

5969243,0,t1_cy235gm,Bist du dir da sicher? Ende letzter Saison htte ich dir sofort zugestimmt aber nach dem Rcktritt und dem was Stranzl bei Sky erzhlt hat kann ich mir das einfach nicht vorstellen zur Erinnerung die Kurzzusammenfassung Man kann mit ihm nicht reden und das schlgt schnell auf die Stimmung einer Mannschaft. Und im Rckblick die Begeisterung ber die Ergebnisse beiseite auch die Art und Weise wie gespielt wurde. Gladbach war sehr defensiv eingestellt Tief verteidigen und den Ball lange halten vorne habens dann Raffael Kruse Hermann und co. schon gerichtet dank der individuellen Klasse und Laufstrke. Da kamen dann teils sehr schne Spielzge zustande aber es hing einfach verdammt viel am Duo KruseRaffael.Unter Schubert hat man gesehen das die Mannschaft gerne offensiv spielt und das auch kann die letzte Woche lass ich mal auen vor die Jungs sahen teilweise sehr K.O. aus bei den Verletzungen kein Wunder es lag also eher nicht an den Spielern sondern am Unwillen Favres das System zu ndern. Der Erfolg gab ihm lange recht aber es war halt einfach nicht sehr vielseitig. Das passt in meinen Augen nicht zu den Bayern die gerne offensiv trotz viel Ballbesitz und variabel auftreten Pep hat das ja perfektioniert mit der Mannschaft. Das heit entweder lassen die Bayern sich auf ein strikteres System ein oder aber Favre passt sich an. Ich traue Favre durchaus zu eine Mannschaft gerade so eine starke offensiv einzustellen aber er hat es in den letzten Jahren halt kaum gezeigt. Das Wichtigste war fr ihn immer eine solide Defensive.Zusammengefasst Favres schwierige Persnlichkeit und das strikte eher defensive taktische System der letzten Jahre machen ihn mMn. nicht gerade zur ersten Wahl fr ein internationales TopTeam.Ich knnt mir eher vorstellen das sich bspw. RB Leipzig irgendwann in naher Zukunft Favre schnappt da die sicher noch nicht attraktiv genug sind fr grere Namen.,Bundesliga,cy23kef,1,t5_2s82y

They have earned the respect of the fans by a very long tradition. . Clubs as gameplay by billionairesRich people who invest money are heavily criticized. That even applies to HSV  a loooong member of the Bundesliga! The headline shows the opinion of a lot of fans.. Hoffenheim RB are stealing places for traditional teamsThere are  teams in the Bundesliga. Hoffenheim and RB are taking two places which is not good in the eyes of the fans. Such clubs are called Plastikvereine  plastic clubs. Teams like Kaiserslautern the red devils are in the . Bundesliga because of the plastic teams. Without them it would be easier to come in the . Bundesliga.. Unfair moneyIn Germany you must work hard for your money. This is the general opinion. Hoffenheim was given money  and that is NOT good! The fans are very proud for the  rule.
