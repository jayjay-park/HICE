3054090,0,t3_2v2214,What youre looking for isnt possible no matter how you cut it.  If you had  or so possibly but you have to remember that no matter what you pick helicopter or multicopter it will require a significant amount of training and  in equipment just to fly the damned thing.  Its possible to build a  class align clone for cheap but youll crash that thing a dozen ways to sunday just learning to fly it. They are not suited for aerial photography but its possible to spend a few hundred dollars on building a rig to make it work in the way youre imagining it will work. Its possible to build a quad for cheaper but were still talking a pretty high learning curve.  If you had  its possible to build a rig that pretty much flies itself. But youll still need a bit more equipment gimbals controllers etc to make it work in the way that you want it to work. Ive never been interested in this stuff but udanisnotfunny has done this sort of thing in a professional capacity. Perhaps he can point you in the right direction to get started and correct any misinformation floating around including anything that might be in this post,RCHeli,coejz0c,1,t5_2rtto
4447587,0,t3_3bl7fp,RC Helis are really addictive. When you get one you think at the moment that it is the last Heli you are going to own.But after crashing modifying gt cost the Heli soon becomes not good enough need for bigger more precise Heli.That is why I recommend you to buy a good transmitter e.g. at least DXi or better as this transmitter can be used for all Helis you buy DSM or DSMX compatible receivers for Helis.I recommend you buy MCPX not any more only MCPX BL which is more expensive as you can invert it and the crash costs arent that high but usually nothing breaks the parts arent very prone to breaking as they are simple. You could also buy a counterfeit of MCPX from e.g. HobbyKing FBL but I cannot say anything about durability of the thing.I wouldnt suggest going for Fixed Pitch Heli MCPX is Collective Pitch Heli you can invert it. They really soon become not enough so the expense could go to Heli parts when crashing e.g. MCPX. When I bought TRex  Fixed Pitch I had only problems with it when I finally got it flying properly I spent for a whole new MCPX Heli and it still didnt fly properly!!!After you get used to flying a real Heli Collective Pitch which can be inverted you really see what you want and need in Helis and probably invest in  Size Heli.One useful investment is also a good battery charger! I went through many batteries when I used an original charger that came with Heli. But they usually charge batteries to quickly and they overcharge them! A simple and good rule is to charge battery only to  of its capacity .V for LiPo instead .V and that doubles the times of charges!!! check BatteryUniversity for tests and I can also confirm the tests. Another good rule is that you never but never discharge buttery lower than .V I had an ESC that allowed battery to discharge to V but when you discharge so low you can easily make battery pack dead as when dropped below V.V the battery cannot be charged anymore!. And when you dont use battery discharge it to .V.V this will also have very good impact on life of the battery as it will lose almost  of its initial capacity. When you fly Heli it is also good not to push the battery to its limits as this also weakens the battery life rather fly  minutes than  and seriously discharge battery. In the end if you are not interested in longevity of the battery life and the costs of buying new batteries then my advice isnt useful to you.,RCHeli,csrayon,1,t5_2rtto
