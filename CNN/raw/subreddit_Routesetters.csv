2267835,0,t3_2l4kel,A little history on me before I answer Ive been climbing for nearly  years and instructing outdoor climbing for  of those years. To answer your question I began working as a climbing instructor at my local YMCAs climbing room and decided that they routes needed changing. I asked my boss if I was allowed to set something new and I began just began trying to mimic the themes and moves I saw in the gym I went to but while keeping my own routes unique and enjoyable. ,Routesetters,cls0vob,3,t5_2vjnz

Then how you set all that after. I like to set it with good foot suggestions for the type of movement I like to see. So the easiest solution is using the desired technique. Also I find that all holds have a direction naturally that they are best in. Manipulating their rotation on the wall helps put the body where I suggest. A foot adjustment can help with the rest.Difficulty in maneuvering could be due to tension or putting the climber out of balance a bit. Switches in body direction with non in cut holds will do this. Compression having to keep the body in a certain place to make the hold useful exaggerating body positions or transitions etc.,Routesetters,cyrpott,1,t5_2vjnz
