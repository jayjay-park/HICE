128849,0,t3_1vk0t7,Not much is going to be factual here because it is a matter of preferences.  However I like Fender and its one of the first guitars I owned.  I just like their play ability.  Also they started out with the Esquire model first and Gibson didnt accept Les Pauls design until Fender started making money with theirs.  Wikipedia has that information but I would find a better source.  ,metalguitar,cet3ru6,1,t5_2sb0j

1580457,0,t3_2cdg4r,As with anything it depends what setup you have and are trying to go to. What guitar do you have what pickups does it have now and what are you thinking about getting?Depending on your answers to these questions the task is anywhere from an easy  minute task to a couple of hours with a router and wiring diagrams.,metalguitar,cjee1dv,2,t5_2sb0j
1841551,0,t1_ckaz76n,The riff is the intro into the song haha so I thought Id make it more of a drum soloish thing instead of just a regular beat because the riff its self is just pretty much tremolo picking! And its on my soundcloud available for download so just click on one of the links above and itll be in my tracks its the demosong.,metalguitar,ckb3qgu,1,t5_2sb0j
1944253,0,t1_ckng11i,Depends on scale length and what youre accustomed to. If youre getting what you want from the lighter strings then theres no reason to change. I used Beefy Slinky and Not Even Slinky sets at drop A on a  scale and found them not heavy enough. They would always go sharp if I played too hard and I like to really dig in with my picking hand. I ended up using ZOG  strings sets and discarding the high e. Not sure what gauge they are because Alex doesnt disclose the gauges but they are heavier than the EB set and work perfectly for me. ,metalguitar,cknhfi7,1,t5_2sb0j

2234563,0,t1_cllqh6x,Yeah no. Nearly all black metal is in E most Heavy Metal and Power Metal is still in E and while many Thrash bands have tuned down theres still lots of Thrash bands that play in E.Consider that you might be listening mostly to a certain genre that downtunes. Thats not representative of all HM....I should probably tell you that I mostly play HMspeed metal in Eb myself.,metalguitar,clnv7jd,-2,t5_2sb0j

7452907,0,t3_4hbuat,Jackson Ibanez LTD like youve mentioned. Schecters are worth a look potentially if thats the road you wanna go down as well. Plenty of options but like FoX has suggested the used gear route couldnt hurt either.As for pickups too thats definitely worth a look if youve got the spare cash to splash on or worth saving up for down the road. Passives Solid second on FoXs Dimarzio callout btw might be more the sort youre after but then again if youre digging Scar Symmetry Pers been using active EMGs I think for the whole run.As for direct recording with EMGs yeah theyre fine. Depends on what youre working with of course but yeah Ive had no problems with any of the EMGS. SA   the new Xs all sorts theyre fine for it.,metalguitar,d2pcjyt,1,t5_2sb0j

And considering the strat gets a way better tone than I remember for metal now Ive started playing it again whacking some way heavier strings on there and swapping one or two of the pickups might do it.,metalguitar,d56uz43,1,t5_2sb0j
