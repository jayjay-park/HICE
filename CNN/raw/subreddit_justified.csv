Boyd has been massacring his enemies just to set his fiance free meanwhile Raylan stepped outside the law to help Sammy get the drop on Nicky. But will the pattern continue? Maybe. Especially if Raylan gets drummed out of the marshals service and becomes a bounty hunter. Hes had plenty of opportunities in the past to exact his own extralegal brand of justice and has passed them up especially with Dickie. Hed much rather wait until he can have the law on his side and not give up as long as he can get it so.

1179912,0,t3_27mtre,I think youre ruining the experience for yourself by comparing it to others shows you like. You want more of the same. Thats ok but youre putting an unfair expectation on the show. This isnt Breaking Bad or The Shield its Jutified. Personally I dont care if you consider it a top show or not because well you know thats just like your opinion man. If you enjoy a show you enjoy it or if you dont you dont. Who cares about arbitrary tiers of quality? Lets go through your points though because I think youre wrong there as well.. You have Raylan Givens absolutely wrong in my opinion. Hes not a comic book inspired hero. Hes actually a bad guy pretending to be a good guy most of the time I think he even has himself convinced. Thats ok though I dont blame you. Its an easy mistake to make if you just casually view the show. You cite what happened with Nicky and yeah thats pretty bad but Nicky was a criminal and in a twisted way had it coming right? What about Winona and his kid? Do they deserve the way Raylan has been treating them? What about the cash Raylan essentially stole by scamming that radio show? Yeah he ended up giving it to Kendal Crowe but he didnt think twice about the fact that the money was scammed. He drinks and sleeps with loose women fights with whoever crosses his path. He doesnt bow to authority and certainly not the law theyre tools for Raylan to do bend and do what he wants. And of course he has that shoot first ask questions later attitude. This is all a product of rebellion against his dad. In reality Raylan is a bad guy but he is a bad guy trying to walk a straight path to spite his criminal and abusive father. This isnt a grey scale system like with Walter White with Justified you have to read between the lines to see Raylan isnt such a great hero after all.. This is you putting your expectations on the show again. Just because YOU dont believe Raylan isnt ever in danger doesnt mean thats true. From an objective standpoint gun fights are by their nature dangerous. We are supposed to enjoy the fact that Raylan is both that good and that lucky. Besides its about the journey not the destination. We all know the star of the show doesnt die. Did you think Walt was going to get gunned down by cops in episode  of Breaking Bad? No because you knew there would be no show. You knew Walt was either going to kill them all or talk his way out of it or run away or in the actual case get passed by completely. You knew that without a doubt but you kept watching because you wanted to know where the story went. Its ok if you dont want to know where Justified goes but dont pretend like the safety of the stars in other shows are really in doubt. You know they arent. This is why Game of Thrones has been such a big game changer for TV because in that show no character is safe.. Your personal preference. I see so many people complain that the Walking Dead has no depth its just zombies zombies zombies shoot shoot shoot. But when they take an episode and try to go deeper I see the other side rage about how the episode was so boring and nothing happened. Granted the walking dead writers are shitty and most dialogue is mediocre at best but the point is youre not the only one watching and youre not the only one the showrunners are trying to please. You want more shooting? Cool. Maybe this isnt the show for you. But lets recognize thats your fault not the shows.,justified,ci2cz0q,11,t5_2rr0v
