8682926,0,t3_4ywrz6,Ive been quite harsh on the new series so far but I have to say I actually enjoyed this episode a lot.The editing and camerawork were noticeably less jumpy this time so getting invested in fights was a lot easier and the competitor bots were more entertaining overall.The annoying educational bit was actually pretty cool this week too!And there was even a next time on RW bit at the end which has been absent so far. Fair enough it was only added because the final is next week but its a step forward.Theres still a lot of the same problems seriously Dara fix your judges decision reveals but overall I felt pretty good about this one.As for the show itself I was rooting for Thermidor and was sad to see it go. Im glad that we got to see more action from Pulsar but I feel Chompalot got cheated by the production team. Why didnt they go and extinguish the batteries as soon as they started smoking? EDIT I guess those batteries would have gone up in any case  thanks uCMOrchestra and uPPDGary for the info!Nice performance from Gabriel. Beast looked sweet but the bad reliability was a shame.Also Ive talked before on this subreddit that I think the house robots need to do more and come in after a knockout from time to time.

8682952,0,t1_d6qyciz,gtPulsar was knocked out  times in the final yet somehow won.Knocked out  they stopped a few times and never for  full seconds. It probably stopped because of transmission errors or something I doubt it was anything to do with Gabriel.gtSure you could argue Pulsar hit Gabriel a lot but Gabriel never broke down once and didnt look like breaking down.Gabriel had a lot of damage done to its wheels and didnt do much damage to Pulsar.gtAnd the previous round Pulsar was put in the pit first yet still it went to a decision.Because Pulsar had already won. The other robot was upside down while its self righting mechanism was open so it was completely immobilised. Sir Killalot interfered and righted it. This happened a lot in the old series and it was never brought up so Im glad it is being dealt with in the new series.You cant say exactly say Gabriel had good knockouts either.,robotwars,d6qzsw4,4,t5_2wxsw

8740608,0,t1_d6xrz8h,Well it was an awful game in terms of mechanics and clipping issues.You couldnt even drive Pussycat a single metre before some part of it clipped into the floor and sent you either into the air or under the arena. If you didnt have two spikes at the front of your robot theyd always clip inside you and all of your armour would shed like it was tissue paper. If you actually managed to complete the game up until you could put the best motors in your robot would then turn and move too quickly to actually be playable with. Flippers never flipped  They just sort of stuck under the opponent until they snapped off. You could literally never get more than  points for style so youd always lose unless it was a KO.If you actually wanted to win you needed to cheese the AI. For the studio you just drove around the pit until the AI drove themselves in. For the carrier you just sort of hoped that the rumbling would push them into the pit before you were pushed onto the launcher or vice versa. For the scrapyard youd just sort of drive at the pit and clip onto the opponent when the pit opened up and drove onto the piston. For the factory you just put max motors on and drove onto the conveyor belt fast enough to make it to the strip of metal behind it so all the AI followed you onto the conveyor into the pit. You couldnt play it properly to win and if you wanted all the signature bots for multiplayer you had to do it.There were so many issues but my god it was a fun game because of them.,robotwars,d6y86ql,12,t5_2wxsw

9841282,1,t1_daplx25,Personally i disagree. Doing a show potentially every  weeks is not enough time to make a turnaround for serious damage. Roboteer costs will go up dramatically asif their not already high enough and theres be no discussion regarding how thats going to be subsidised. Similarly the lack of an OOTA zone will lead to more boring fights as pnuematics are limited supply  theres no objective for them. Blank arenas like these do encourage spinner vs rambot metas where its irresistible forces vs immovable objects. The pit equals it up abit however theres still the issue of trying to provide each robot type a method of victory  axes score points flippers try to OOTA spinners kill ect,robotwars,daqcbmg,2,t5_2wxsw

I think part of the issue is removing the style part of the scoring process. Cherub is a robot that does very well on on the Style criteria. Without that it can only really score high on control and aggression by pushing or driving at bots vs most bots in the show. PPD technically did way more damage  though I guess you could argue damaging the arena doesnt count. In the end it didnt matter that much as it seemed like the major damage was done in that fight for PPD  it could hardly operate for its other fights. In general Cherub got lucky that both major competitors made major screwups against them. Maybe its a blessing from the robot gods for having mercy during the last wars?,robotwars,deukysr,7,t5_2wxsw

11362165,0,t3_61zkil,Ive been thinking about this too. One thing I dont like about the round robin is that if a crappy robot lucks through the first melee we then have to watch three fights with them. Im all for an underdog but if a robot really is worthless at least in a knockout format it wouldnt last too long.Id like to see them return to the old format too the main issue I can see is the old shows were  minutes right? so thered have to be an extra  minutes of filler. ,robotwars,dfjvoyg,1,t5_2wxsw

11421227,0,t1_dfqka2d,Its between Thor and Apollo for me. Both of them had quite easy fights and won them convincingly though I think Apollo looked stronger than Thor. But Apollo was absolutely crushed twice by Carbide. Thor seemed to be plagued by reliability issues though whereas Apollo worked well in every fight except the final so Id be more likely to choose Apollo based on that. Theyll put the champion in though almost certainly. ,robotwars,dfql1vy,3,t5_2wxsw
