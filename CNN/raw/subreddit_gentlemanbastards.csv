2695686,0,t3_2qwl19,No. Its an interesting part of the world. Ive read too many stories where both sides had sorcerers and only by believing in the heart of the cardstraining with master yodagetting a pure bottle of metals that the Lord Ruler had hidden for a millenium could the good sorcerers defeat the bad ones. Locke can con just about anyone is he overpowered because hes cleverer than everyone else? A good story should be unbalanced real life is unbalanced. I dont think this series is for you if you want everything to be fair. To this point there is no counter to the Bond magi and thus they can dominate warfare politics and life itself when they choose to do so.That the bondsmagi are so powerful makes the first book so compelling. Lockes society has the same view of the bondsmagi that you do yet he is able to overcome one.spoiler,gentlemanbastards,cnag1az,3,t5_2sutv
4310294,0,t1_csbecr3,I was hoping he would be because I like him as a villain but really Im not that surprised. Its hard to see how Bondsmagi and Falconer could fit in with the war in the Seven Marrows which IMO is such a big plot development that adding more villains and problems would just take away from the experience and confuse the plot. If not book four I hope we at least get to see Falconer show up in a later installment in the Gentleman Bastards series ,gentlemanbastards,csbhvv3,2,t5_2sutv

8037493,0,t3_4payy8,The character development comes mostly in the form of flashbacks. You see the leading characters fleshed out more and more as the series goes on. What Im saying is dont give up or lose faith. Its a great story. ,gentlemanbastards,d4jhmps,6,t5_2sutv

10699463,0,t1_ddjjx46,I understand having to wait but the company thats been publishing Lynchs books have made a point to set goals they have no intention of keeping? Many other authors I know and read have kept to those goals so much so that Ive reserved copies of books two or so months in advanced and gotten them. I wont reserve Lynchs books despite my love of the Bastards because Gollancz ?? simply doesnt keep a tidy schedule.Its just me whinging about things that make sense but I ultimately have no control over. I get the point but its why I keep a level head when people talk about release dates. On a more fun note Lynch posted a page from Thorn of Emberlain that was fun to read!,gentlemanbastards,ddjkj6v,1,t5_2sutv
11688258,0,t1_dgkquoq,Its written in a way such that its pretty definitively explained by the end of the book. The third person point of views in the book are a pretty decent reality test and seem to confirm the explanation eventually given. ,gentlemanbastards,dgkvr6w,1,t5_2sutv
