Suburbs are a sign and symptom of economic injustice in our economic landscape and blight to our ecology. The development of suburbs in the last century along with white flight to those suburbs destroyed the best parts of many American cities. For those who have a choice living and working in the city and supporting its institutions with tax money and involvement is simply a more just way to live.

They arent being arrested for murder or tax evasion theyre being put in prison for growing pot andor selling pot depending on the case...both of which are crimes.I dont know how to explain this any more simply without using a crayola crayon.Just because you arent committing one crime doesnt mean you arent committing other crimes...and in this case theyre committing felonies by selling pot.You may not like the federal law but that doesnt change the fact that it is still federal law and federal agents are not only allowed but expected to enforce it...and there is absolutely nothing Sheriffs can do to stop them because federal agents arent breaking any laws by enforcing federal laws.Let me put this in baby talk for your small mind JUST BECAUSE STATE SAY OK DOES NOT MEAN IT IS OK UNLESS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAY OK TOO.Tennessee can make it legal for me to manufacture machine guns and give them to children...but federal agents can and will kick down my door for doing so because its still illegal under federal law and the Sheriff wouldnt be legally allowed to stop them.So what part of this idea do you struggle with? Do you not understand overlapping jurisdiction? Are you too stupid to understand how federal law works?

Grocery stores do sell beer though. Also liquor stores cant sell anything that doesnt contain alcohol so you cant buy rum and Coke from the same store.To add to this point  liquor stores are closed on Major holidays ie th of July.Welcome to Nashville  I moved from Melbourne Fl about  years ago.

Then all throughout this year chat up everyone you meet who lives in that area to get a landlord hookup. Most everyone I know over there lives in a place that does not advertise. A lot of the landlords that cater to the college kid market are so saturated with options that they just keep renting places word of mouth and have never needed to advertise.  Anecdote My little sister graduated Belmont in  and her place is still rented almost legacy style with each new tenant being only maybe  degrees of separation from her original roommate group little sisters high school friends etc...

Everyone raves about Martins buy I just dont see it. If you really want some delicious BBQ you should plan a day trip to Memphis and have food at Central BBQ.Here we can clearly see that the first few sentences were suggestions of where to eat in Nashville and how the guy would rate them. Saying  honestly Nashville BBQ isnt that great was a direct reply to OP saying I heard you have some amazing BBQ. This was just a way of putting this in perspective.

2551552,0,t3_2oy9hc,I dont know much about hotels but I can help with the rest of your questions!FoodLoveless Cafe freaking delicious countrystyle cooking. The Pharmacy arguably the best burgers in Nashville. Jacks BarBQue killer barbeque downtown. Of course these restaurants tend to be packed during peak hours so Id recommend going a little earlier or a little later especially around dinnertime. The wait is absolutely worth it though. EntertainmentI dont know what kind of music you guys are into but there are tons of great concert venues around town. More concerts are announced as the date gets closer so Id check closer to MarchApril. The Ryman Opry and Bridgestone Arena are the bigger ones. Marathon Music Works Cannery Ballroom ExitIn and the Woods at Fontanel are smaller. LP field is a football stadium but sometimes has large concerts. Lonnies Karaoke Bar is always a blast last at night. Delicious hot dogs outside hilarious and great crowd inside. Wildhorse Saloon has drinks a live band and a dance floor for line dancing. Its usually pretty packed on weekends but Ive never not had a great time there. Theres also a lot of hiking and museums depending on what your group is interested in. Ive been to a cool laser tag place downtown if thats your thing. SceneI personally think Nashville is a fantastic city. Downtown honky tonk is really touristy but a blast. You can walk down the street and every bar you pass has live music. Lots of stores selling cowboy boots and the like. The rest of the city has a really artsy hip vibe to it. Lots of holeinthewall restaurants stores and coffee shops. People are really nice always lots of fun things to do. One thing Id say is that the street layout is pretty terrible and traffic is awful around rush hour.

3972878,0,t3_35z03h,TLDR  There arent many options for office space for people in the art community. In  I started a graphic design company. Starting with no money I had limited options of where to work so we worked out of my  square foot apartment...all  of us. After a few complaints about having so many people parking in the apartment complex we eventually were forced to find office space.The office spaces we found were were often time too expensive or limited. For example we could have had an office in the bellevue mall but would have to have been prepared to vacate within  hours if the mall sold.We wound up setting up shop in the Arcade downtown. It was a REALLY great place to work entertaining people would show up on a daily basis but there were a ton of limitations. No parking for my staff or our clients. No central hear or air meant summers were hot and winter was cold. But this was one of the only places within our price range. I know that Im not the only person who has run into this very same predicament and Im really fired up that this is a problem hes looking to solve! ,nashville,cr953if,-2,t5_2qimh

As a designer designing a logo for a big client is way more than just throwing some shit up like this.  So some state exec comes at you with an idea and if youre lucky a font in mind.  You go through about  revisions trying to properly portray this vision some ex governors grandson scribbled on a napkin.  Finally you get the right asshole to sign off on a proof.  This process from start to end consumes dozens of your best talents hours.  k is retarded for a logo that simple but sometimes you quote a shitty client an absurd price for something you dont want to do and sometimes they actually pay it.As a government administrator  you have a limited budget and little time to oversee every little thing.  Sometimes you just have to throw money at problems.  The k probably includes a part of redesigning individual departments logos etc.  Having a consistent brand is important.  Disorganization is the biggest problem in governments.That all being said this new logo sucks shit through a shit sock.,nashville,cri9l80,1,t5_2qimh

I called them twice to confirm this....Except such a test does not actually exist. Verified through research and other medical professionals.Also during my visit they assigned someone else to my exam room was walked in on. Simple mistake sure but with everything else this left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth as it couldve been a lot worse and seemed unorganized.

4698090,0,t1_ctmg1nc,Okay Ill just start by saying that I come from a city that is chalked full of classic buildings from masters like Daniel Burnham Louis Sullivan and Van Der Rohe but if youd like a contemporary example take a look at the Aqua building by Jeanne Gang in Chicago. Its an absolute masterpiece. As for proportions and materials much like its glass neighbor the Pinnacle building? its way too squat and wide and the transition from the bland cheap looking tan facade to blue glass makes it worse. The stone sides step back and get narrower as they travel upwards to the towers but the glass does the opposite as it dumps upwards into a giant blue trapezoid which throws the balance off entirely. Believe it or not the two towers at the top are not the worst part its the ridiculous arch that connects them that ruins the whole thing it looks like it was plucked right from the entryway of a mcmansion tract home . In fact Im pretty sure I read somewhere that arch was added as an afterthought specifically to support the giant logo... Its a shitty building man. Sorry.

5176417,0,t1_cv9w9nm,Cobb claims the permits were properly issued but as Hubardd points out generally a demolition permit is required along with public notice  that didnt happen here.  In this case Cobb used his own judgment to claim the rehab permits he approved for various changes to the building added up to a demolition permit.  This interpretation is unconventional to say the least.From the Tennessean article  Robbie Jones a board member of Historic Nashville Inc. said the local preservationist group was perplexed at how a rehab permit evolved into a demolition permit in less than a month. He considers it unprecedented that previous permits issued for interior demolition and remodeling and exterior demolition equated to a full demolition permit.  Theres much more detail from HNI on their social media pages.The more cynical among us might notice this happened four days before a change at the Mayors office.

You can find stuff in that price range in Madison North Nashville Bordeaux occasionally in Donelson Hermitage. Possibly Goodlettsville. Its tough  but not impossible.

TNs only natural lake made by the big quake a long time agoSo going east we have gtNatural beautyRadnor Lake in the heart of South Nashville. The most rewarding part of these trails is getting to the hilltops to see Nashville. usually very visible in the winter Its not an epic hike by any means definitely a state park for the locals.Big South Fork on the Cumberland PlateauFall Creek Falls beautiful waterfall ampamp hike in a state park.The Chimney Tops in the Smokies beautiful rock formations with epic mountain views at the summit.Whitewater rafting on the Ocoee for sure will not disappoint. near ChattanoogaLookout Mountain near Chattanooga can scratch the hiking itch with beautiful views and the history itch with the whole oh yeah this is where crazy Confederates kept watch for Shermans troops.You could really spend all of your time in the Smokies how much time do you have? and it would be well worth it.Cute old townsHistoric Rugby TN just south of Big South Fork really cute old town.

Dont get a pug or a give a pug if you ignore point two unlessuntil youre prepared for extremely high healthcare costs special diets allergies snoring anal gland issues and breathing problems for  years.. Adopting a pet shouldnt be something you rush through. Especially not in  days.I say this as the owner of two pugs and a pug foster parent. Both of my dogs were rescued out of awful breeding situations where they were abused neglected overbred and now suffer from multiple health problems some related to their breed but most related to their early years in awful living conditions. Most of the fosters I get have similar stories. Pugs are a special needs breed but everyone ignores that because Oh My God Look At The Puppy!!. Breeders count on that which is why they overbreed them sell them at an extortionate rate and give you no preparation for a life with a pug. People keep them for about a year and then the snoring gets old or the medical bills start to rise and then I get calls from rescues looking for fosters because another pug puppy has been abandoned.

IIRC Durham Farms will be upper middle class.  I think the homes will start  and go up to .  That will put it on par with a few of the other neighborhoods that feed the local schools.  If you need another recommendation Mansker Park is a good stable neighborhood.  It is right off the Vets and the kids will be zoned Madison Creek.

As we can see in this thread there are already a ton of people that dont understand the difference in how soccer and baseball are structurred.   This isnt a minor league team this is a lower league team which is a big differnce.  We dont needc casual fans getting the mind set that its just like minor league baseball where you dont actually care about whats happening on the field your just there for the hot dogs.

If you get a canoe or kayak the only catch is figuring out how to coordinate getting back to your car. If you go with a friend just stash their car at your planned takeout. Otherwise youll need a bicycle to stash hitchhike or give one of the outfitters a few bucks to haul you and your boat to a put in. You can catch bass small and large mouth trout between January and early June catfish gar carp buffalo bream and crappie. Its also pretty beautiful especially at sunrise. Ive seen deer turkeys coyotes beavers hawks tons of turtles and some snakes. Ive always wanted to try Richland creek by the McCabe greenway. There is a pond right next to hwy  out past Belle Meade that I frequently see being fished but Ive never seen any fish come out of it. The stones river below the dam is supposed to be good too. And of course the caney is legendary for trout.

Youll learn things like why fiscal stimulus rather than monetary policy is the best way of stimulating an economy against the zero bound why interest rates and growth are likely to remain low for years why government spending can crowd out business investment except when the economy is against the zero bound and a whole host of other things that will reward you.I took marketing at NT and subsequently at Vandy.   You get what you pay for...    You may find marketing management to be a more useful class.I used to do website design.   Just buy a book on your preferred languages and Just Do It.  I dont think a teacher would add much here.,nashville,d4rdmyp,2,t5_2qimh

Cops have a hard job and some cops are racist but being mouthy froggy and having attitude will not have a positive outcome because of the very job we ask cops to do.

8705419,0,t1_d6tavvd,You are comparing apples to oranges showing your short sidedness and lack of knowledge on technology.  The automated technology is already out there and being used.  Uber last week launched a pilot of  autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh in partnership with Carnegie Melon University.Google has sidewalks labs.  They are looking to help cities with their infrastructure.  This is going to be your money.  You may want to turn over your money to invest in ancient technology but I sure as hell dont.  Id much rather see us work with companies in the private tech sector to make sure we are keeping pace with change. If you dont think machine learning via neural networking will solve how many cars can fit on the road then you will really be shocked over the next  years.  How do you think Google maps or Apple maps knows when traffic occurs.  Those little red lines that show up on the map so you know to avoid that area?  Those are algorithms based on signals from your phone.  How fast those phones are moving the number of phones in that area etc.   Currently traffic engineers cant control variations in the speed of a driver without speed limits.  Even then there are still variations.  If cars can talk to each other wirelessly then they can account for additions and subtraction of vehicles on the road.  They can make the speed of vehicles a constant.  They can make adjustments if people need to merge or get off at an exit.  Its an algorithm problem that can be solved with data collection in a relatively short time.  Companies like Google probably already have a lot of this data through the Waze App.  That is why they require your location to use it. ,nashville,d6tt8bl,-2,t5_2qimh

This gym is taking something novel that has been around for a long time and using infomercial tactics to make it seem like its the future. Isokinetic machines are simply a tool with their pros and cons like everything else. You could easily use them for  minute per set instead of   exercises instead of   days instead of  etc. Important with exercises programs to remember everything works in the beginning nothing works forever,nashville,d7mnzjr,1,t5_2qimh

I guess I shouldve said its quasidecriminalized because they dont HAVE to arrest you now unless you have over half an ounce which means youre dealing or growing. Or if you have it in multiple baggies. Or as others said they could use their discretion to arrest certain colors...but metro Nashville PD has an excellent record with race relations. Im sure if someone here was accused of being biased in arrests the chief would take appropriate reaction. Nashville is very progressive compared to most of the south.For what you brought up state troopers are obligated to state law on marijuana.

9326909,0,t3_587lew,I was lucky and was gifted a trip over New Years by the guy I was dating at the time. Hands down it was one of the most luxurious experiences I can imagine one could have. I really cant speak to the value as I wasnt the one who had to bare the brunt of the cost but Ill forever remember the experience.For one the place is beautiful. The architecture interiors landscaping. Everything is so well thought out that you really feel that Blackberry Farm is pretty special. Im a major food nut and know the Nashville scene well and am decently familiar with the restaurant scenes in the surrounding areas. The Barn at Blackberry where youll eat dinner has some of the best. The level of execution is perfect. We had  courses both nightson the first night we paid an up charge for it. The second night was NYE and the  course option was the default. Oops. Wed have only had chosen the second night had we known. The third night we ate the normal fair included in the rate which I believe was a starter entree and dessert each. The two coursed meals were phenominal but the regular food was still better than  of the restaurant experiences youll have traveling. The last part of what youre getting from Blackberry Farm is the service. The people we saw more than twice began to call us by name. The concierge who checked us in knew our names before we could give them to him.My ex struggled to decide between two of the entrees on the last night. He asked the server for his opinion and still struggled. When the meal came out our server brought both entrees just because. On new years eve we left the party to spend some time alone around . Behind our room was a beautiful bonfire surrounded by rocking chairs over looking a huge field. There wasnt a soul around. Next to the fire was a crate filled with mason jars containing Graham crackers marshallows and chocolate. A guy came by every  minutes to tend the fire... he was going from one fire on the property to the next keeping them going. We rang in the new year just the two of us. Blackberry Farm is an incredible place. There are SO many stories about my experience that I cant even share. The truffle puppies horseback riding on the grounds celebrity sightings. If the price is within your reach Id recommend it. Its an experience Ill never forget. ,nashville,d8y95y1,17,t5_2qimh

10635187,0,t3_5rmp1x,Im pretty excited  I think the riverfront is one of the cities best assets. Metro has been putting money into making that stretch of the Cumberland more accessible to kayakers. This seems like a wholistic approach to a riverfront lots of people can enjoy. I think in the not too distant future well also see more development around Lock  as places that are  minutes from downtown disappear. Construction has already started on the Top Golf Driving range which will sort of anchor the first part of the development on the south side near the stadium  crosspoint church.I think it might be technically in flood plane since a number of the warehouses over there flooded  there was a lot of musical equipment stored over there that was lost. All that can be solved by a first floor parking area. I also saw a new pedestrian bridge in one of the sketches I saw  though that may be a little aspirational. ,nashville,ddcxsf7,1,t5_2qimh

Using Ticketmaster as essentially your box office is one thing it means the venue has passed on its box office service to a third party who then charges a usage fee which Ticketmaster does. This is a separate issue from what Im talking about which is when either the venues box office directly or their ticket selling platform is plagued by scalpers who buy up all the tickets and then turn around and markup at many times more the facevalue. And it happens all the time weve discussed it on this subreddit ad nauseum when concert tickets go on sale and within minutes theyre all bought up and show up minutes later on other selling platforms for hundreds of a percent more in markup.

11672055,0,t1_dgimq5x,Basically. Its pretty simple. If youre behind the center red line youre not allowed to shoot the puck down the ice past the opposing goal line. There are two outcomes to this scenario. A player from your team is able to race and beat the opposing player to the face off dot near the puck the icing is canceled and play continues. ORThe opposing player reaches the face off dot first Icing will be assessed. What this means is that the puck is brought back into your defensive zone and your tired players have to stay on the ice until the next faceoff. Sometimes the ref will cancel the icing if it is determined that the opposing player was not putting enough effort into playing the puck before it reached the goal line. ,nashville,dgj1kwf,1,t5_2qimh
