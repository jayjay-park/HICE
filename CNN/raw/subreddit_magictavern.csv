11732131,0,t3_65wumz,I kind of agree. I think the main problem was the amount of buildup. If they had instead gone on Usidores quest earlier somewhere around ep  and then spent a bunch of time traveling to places then been captured by the Dark Lord on his home turf it wouldve been a little more satisfying and allowed for more different arcs Tavern Travelling Captured.All that said however I still love this show and will continue to listen for a very long time. ,magictavern,dgpv8hl,1,t5_391yd
