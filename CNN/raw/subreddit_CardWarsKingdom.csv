9353971,0,t3_58jzm2,The good I like the look of it nice to see the shard idea also adds to replay value. Like the guaranteed critter pack for the month I will likely bite on this one.The bad Graphic problems having issues on my  inch tablet where most of the images of items creatures ingredients cards are a black square. Very hard to play blind like this especially when you are trying to put together teams gather ingredients etc. After winning a battle freeze which seems to be associated with getting items not cake usually though hard to say what it is as they just look like black squares to me. Drops on ingredients tried about  times to get ingredients to upgrade my critters and never got a single onethe highest level one. The odds seem even less than they were prior to upgrade. My teams from pre update were all disassembled.,CardWarsKingdom,d91old0,2,t5_3fgj8

9659456,0,t1_da3ozug,You are about as bright as a box of broken light bulbs. I confirmed that I contribute to the game before you created an alt account to spread your negativity. If it was  it wouldnt be a free game now would it? k downloads doesnt mean shit. Ive had to redownload the game a half dozen times. Even if it did mean k unique accounts thats free accounts which in no way translates to k people that would pay even  just to download and play the game.    Frankly if you can afford to contribute your hard earned money to something that gives you hours and hours of entertainment yet take pride in leeching instead youre kind of a dick as far as Im concerned. ,CardWarsKingdom,da3qao6,2,t5_3fgj8

9770817,0,t1_daeu3zx,Ok so Im somewhat less upset after managing to acquire Mayo Slick... I say somewhat because a it doesnt need to be powered up Corn Dragon comes at level  b its something that Ill use outside of adventures but c it still took me my entire energy bar plus an extra  minutes waiting for my energy to replenish for the final battle in which I eventually got my reward.To sum up Im not sure whether to be salty about the work to reward ratio or to try to concentrate on the moments like this where finally getting something out of the game makes me leap out of my seat to end zone taunt my phone.Fuck it I got Mayo Slick. Much like Ice Cube I really must say that today was a good day.,CardWarsKingdom,dahgwof,1,t5_3fgj8
