If you can go into the emotions and breathe through them that should help this stuff gets held in our tissues so its important to deal with it while its still moving after the work hence the journaling. Everyone is different though so you might continue with some emotional releases through massage and you might not.  In my personal experience if you can find something that triggers an emotional release and make some time to go into it you will be much better off than letting it stew.,massage,ceoz028,3,t5_2qmyc

463429,0,t3_1zbl8w,At my first job in MA we had to display our licences publicly as per state law. One of our therapists started having a client show up outside her house. So the boss covered the addresses up with some postits. Then we where inspected and given a warning for not showing the whole licence. So the postits came off and some guy showed up at another therapists house. Then we put it directly behind the receptionists head so you had to be really obvious when looking at it and put small pieces of scotch tape over the address numbers to make them a little blurry. ,massage,cfsxyrz,1,t5_2qmyc
468346,0,t3_1zehbo,deep tissue massage done right uses a very minimal amount of lubrication.  In many instances you dont even need any lubrication at all except in places with hair.  The trick is just to go slow sink in and let their tissues push themselves back into your hands the tools.  Not good for a therapist to use you as a guinea pig on that though make sure they have plenty of experience in NM first and that they are comfortalbe with not using lubes cant give a good NM massage with much lube anyway.I have a massage teacher that has eczema.  Extremely sensitive skin to all oils and creams and lotions breaks out in a rash with just a little bit of exposure.  He uses olive oil and has no problems.  Try spot testing olive oil on your skin and see if you have a reaction to it.Barring that I would also try spot testing pure vitamin e oil  this can be gotten from any drug store.  make sure its  percent with no additives or anything stupid like that.,massage,cfti3n6,1,t5_2qmyc

995942,0,t3_25i3qt,Pulled this from an old post I commented onI worked for almost . years with Massage Envy w  of those years at one clinic. My coworkers were amazing with one or two exceptions and my clients were fabulous. My Envy wasnt hard up on us making sales so it was more relaxed that most people probably find it. The owner was great and was an active part of the business. He came in every week. Plus he threw great parties! It was my first job out of massage school. The first ME I worked at for  months. It wasnt bad just very slow and I wasnt making enough money. The last one I worked at was not good I only stayed for  weeks. The manager was a nut and the clients were terrible. I actually really miss my team and clients only bad thing about moving out of state.Since making this post I have gone back to working for Massage Envy brand new location. I have a great new manager and franchise owners that work very hard to make our workplace feel like home and make us feel like a family. Im proEnvy but lots of people arent. Some franchises will work you to the bone but if you get a good one that understands youre not a indentured servant theyll give you a reasonable work schedule. We have a few people just out of school that work only  hours a day total and only do two massages back to back. But it really does vary franchise to franchise. Id say go check it out and do a practical interview. If you can talk to whatever staff you can snag and get a feel for the place. I can tell you more about pay and policies if youd like.

The bonus is that if your doctor recommends massage therapy the cost of the massages become tax deductible.  No tax deduction without a doctor recommendation.  Physical therapists are trained to provide you with appropriate exercises for your injury.Scope of PractiseDo Not DiagnoseWe can tell clients what we have observed but we shouldnt put a name to it. We can say It looks like you have a tightness in your wrist but not declare that the client has carpal tunnel syndrome. For your own integrity and for the sake of the client dont even subtly imply a diagnosis.Even recommending exercise can be over the line in some states.

4162378,0,t1_crtvbdw,Yeah I know what you mean. Id have to have a REALLY strong feeling to reject someone outright. Im a female therapist so my concerns are usually for my own safety however. I do a similar type of therapy I think I know the style you are referring to. These styles can make people feel kind of emotional zonked and  if theyre not used to it  confused after a session. Its even possible that something in the session brought back memories repressed or otherwise of a previous sexual assault. Things like PTSD can take years to surface and can be triggered seemingly at random. And as a practitioner you know how profound the mindbody connection can be when it comes to memory. If she has a history of sexual trauma you wouldnt have had to touch her inappropriately...a random specific touch could trigger a memory anywhere on the body. But previous trauma or not I wonder if she came home feeling emotional and acting a little groggy. Her boyfriend would have assumed the worst and freaked. Then when he got the full scoop he didnt feel like calling back to say Oops my bad sorry bro.. Or you know theyre trying to screw you somehow. But my moneys on the former. If she was planning to go to the police to accuse you of rape she would have gotten a rape kit at the time. If youre not aware a rape kit is a specific physical checkup that is done if a girl has just been raped it collects evidence of violationsex which is then used in criminal proceedings. Not all women go to the cops right away which makes it harder to prosecute their rapist. But someone who immediately makes an accusation and talks to the cops would have this done. You know it wouldnt show anything because you didnt rape her. But if shed gone to the cops Im sure you would have gotten a call regardless. So long story short I dont think you need to be waiting for the other shoe to drop. But that is scary as fuck!,massage,crupygo,1,t5_2qmyc

If you want to seem serious get at least a  page website so potential clients can get a sense of who you are or what you do beyond whats on the printed page. And google plus and Facebook but I feel you should stay away from paid advertising maybe at least until the massage gig can pay for its own ads.  And whatever you do stay away from groupon.  Those clients will almost never become your clients as they are first and foremost clients of groupon and The Deal.Hair salons seem like good businesses to network with because they look for topics to chat with their clients all day long. Pllus they need the work scissor hand arm blow dry hand arm and opposite hip and the Barbers Lean.

5923030,0,t1_cxcb0os,Theres lots of advantages to working for a franchise.  The number one advantage is no responsibilities just focus on the work.  The franchises are set up to take care of the front end with all that comes with working with the general public securing payment scheduling and screening people.  They also pay for all the overhead and taxes.  Like any corporation they are a shield against litigation because they have contracts written by lawyers covering everything that the state regulators dont deal with mostly having to do with securing payment for services. The number one challenge for some professionals is getting paid and the next challenge is know how to manage their income.  Most of the money one makes in any business goes to overhead.

Everyone has a randomly generated set of questions so you might have a totally different experience but I got a surprising number of pathology related ones honestly caught me a bit off guard. Anatomy is pretty important too youll definitely get a diagram or two.Out of curiosity are you studying at TLC by chance?,massage,d0izryw,2,t5_2qmyc

I have been learning about and experiencing first hand how essential oils and cannabisbased topicals can have great effects on problem areas.  Edit  Im sorry to see this get downvoted.  In my state there are a lot of massage therapists using cannabisbased topicals with great success and popularity for what OP describes and my school educates students at length on essential oils and herbalism for massage therapy.

I use very much of my elbows and forearms and lean in with my body  I do unfortunately love using my thumbs for things but have limited that a lot.

7946929,0,t1_d4930fw,Thats possible but I would check into your local laws.

8551376,0,t3_4vyqce,Honestly  sounds like workshop money. If you want to learn massage I would immediately go to a  day work shop. You will learn some basic fundamentals that will improve the quality of your massage right away. It will also give you a better idea of whether this is just something you wanna do for your gf because you love her or something you wanna do for everyone for money because you love massage.  Go take the workshop but if you want to get more serious than that be prepared for a commitment. My schooling was k and . months. I dont regret it at all. However massage isnt just some side job like I initially thought it would be.,massage,d6ahtqg,2,t5_2qmyc

9059094,0,t3_5487wq,It really depends on you your body your self care and your body mechanics. The biggest thing I see in new therapists that leads to burnout is A pushing too hard too fast B relaxing their body mechanics and C the biggest one using their hands and fingers too much and not enough forearms and elbows. I think lots of therapists will make one or more of these mistakes and probably more than once Im terrible with B and C and I can always tell by the end of the day.I currently work  days a week  massages a day. Occasionally I will end up doing  or  or spend the morning doing chair massage and the evening table massage but I always regret those days. Ive been massaging almost  years and the only time I felt close to burning out was when I was doing  massages  days a week. That lasted about  months before I put a stop to that. Take care of your body and it will continue to make you money. No sense in making an extra  a day if you can only keep that pace up for a few years before your body fails. ,massage,d80rab7,2,t5_2qmyc

9302354,0,t3_57uj07,Thats a hard question to answer because there is no objective measure of pressure in a massage. The amount of effort exerted by the therapist and the depth of pressure perceived by the client dont always match up how youd think. Ive finished massages and thought that was easy and the person comes out saying man Im gonna be sore tomorrow.For me I strive to use enough pressure to where the person feels like its deep but not so much where they have to brace themselves against the pain. I tell clients they can always ask for more pressure but if you are holding your breath to get through it imma back off a little. Theres a sweet spot. When you get it right the person feels good pain and they want you to keep doing what youre doing. When you overdo it they are waiting for you to stop even if they say go as deep as you want through clenched teeth. ,massage,d8v52v3,5,t5_2qmyc

10148202,0,t1_dbu5vku,Im not a big fan of blanket statements.As an instructor at a massage school Ive dealt with the sluggish response from someone higher up on the food chain than I in regards to updating information. Its frustrating. When presented with the outdated information the response was essentially that its up to the instructors to update the information as needed within the classroom. So thats what I do.I feel a great responsibility to the students who are trusting me to give them the best information I can. I also tell the students that while Im giving them the best information to my knowledge not only am I human but information canwill change over time as BETTER questions are asked and answered. I encourage them to question not just me but their other instructors as well to back up our statements with plausible explanations. I teach the biopsychosocial model and encourage critical thinking. I go through curriculum materials update what I can before presenting them and if its material that the students already have in hand I point out this is what many have been taught but now we know... To some extent I feel like Im stuck having to at least present both because theyll in most cases need to pass the MBLEx and will be entering a field where many still practice based on a structural model.No there is no financial incentive for me to put the extra effort into my job BUT I DO feel that I have the ethical responsibility to do my best by the students who are investing their time and money. Fuck ego. I tell students Ive been wrong before and Ill be wrong again but each day as we go forward we have to strive to be less wrong  we owe that to our clients. Im also not a healer  any healing the client experiences is theirs. We just have the opportunity and privilege to be present with our clients to be allowed into their personal space where we can work to support them as they seek pain relief stress reduction or whatever their goals are for the time we have with them.,massage,dbubafn,5,t5_2qmyc

10425825,0,t3_5p6wgj,I am not a massage therapist but instead work at a commercial massage clinic. Since our therapist take home so little compared to our rate they enjoy and look forward to tips. Some of them remember the tippers and will give an extra good massage. However most go under the notion that they will not be tipped and are pleased when they do. If there is a front desk staff and they ask you about gratuity dont be offended. I ALWAYS ask because I have to authorize what you want to do on a card but still some people are ass hats about me asking. Go with how you feel and ask the workers there who arent therapists. A lot of people will ask me whats normal? And we have a guide based on what people typically tip so that you can have an idea. ,massage,dcpu3vu,2,t5_2qmyc

11399508,0,t3_61f7ws,If I were in your shoes I would ask your boss for documentation showing the IRS requirements. I did some googling and found some information relating to Salons requiring booth rentals for legalIRS reasons but I dont believe the same rules would apply to massage therapists. Also If you are paying a booth rental fee then there should be some way for you to renegotiate your pay rate it doesnt make much sense to keep less than half of your earnings and have to pay rental fees. Edit  It seems that the state of Massachusetts has specific requirements  for salon booth rentals but once again it looks like this applies specifically to cosmetologists. Do you work in a spa that has estheticians or cosmetologists renting booths? You may be able to point out that the same rules dont apply to massage therapists and get him to waive the rental fee for you.,massage,dfo4bh2,1,t5_2qmyc

11588715,0,t3_64vdx3,Just ask politely either in person or via email.  Be honest  tell the therapist that the constant draping  undraping is breaking your concentration and taking you out of the relaxation massage.  Youll likely not be the first person to ever ask himher this question regardless of the answer.Not sure what draping laws are in Canada they vary wildly by state and local jurisdiction here in the US.  Some localities are very strict buttocks and genitals and breasts for both genders covered at all times no exceptions.Others require only the intergluteal cleft i.e. butt crack! and genitalia be covered and perhaps breasts for females only.Still other jurisdictions say nothing about draping and some qualify their draping requirements by saying exceptions are permitted if both therapist and client agree.And to be honest  local laws dont always mean squat behind closed doors.  I lived in a Deep South county where contact with the bare buttocks was illegal during a massage.  But nearly every massage I received there included glute massage.  So its probably more about the therapists individual comfort level with the client than the strict letter of the law.Again ask politely.  Youre not the first to ask youre not the last.  Just respect the therapists decision.,massage,dg9l6qo,1,t5_2qmyc
11653214,0,t3_667nke,nd year MRU Massage Student here. We seem to get better recognition for transfer to regulated provinces. For example I could take the Ontario board exam without having my courses looked at if I graduated from Mount Royal. BC would audit my courses but Ive never heard of anyone being told they need more training as a MRU grad. So the biggest asset to taking MT at a University is all the work put into interprovince transfers. In province I keep getting told we are prefered but have no evidence for it. If Alberta regulates there is some talk that some of the colleges will no longer be recognised but previous graduates would be grandfathered. Not sure if that helps.,massage,dggwmwp,2,t5_2qmyc
