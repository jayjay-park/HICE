8769259,1,t3_507ih0,As much as I love HTBAHB I agree that Agnes is the weakest song. To me it sounds like a song theyre going to play in a commercial for a romance movie. it lacks the strange mysterious sexy vibes that I think GA has perfected ,glassanimals,d71tlaz,0,t5_31klt
8806063,0,t1_d72m067,I feel this same way Zaba is fucking flawless but HTBAHB is way better than a Zaba . I like the shift its equally as emotionally moving at times taking you to a different place. I just want them to keep making music im along for the ride.oh and I saw them in LA on the Zaba tour and these guys bring the energy to songs that seemingly dont have it. Fantastic performers.

8929039,0,t3_52flai,I love Anthony Fantano even though he definitely seems pretentious when it comes to the music I personally like. The only issue I see with the review is that he doesnt seem to see the songs as each a story but its obviously all about personal taste at that point. Like him or hate him he articulates his ideas very well.,glassanimals,d7l50bn,4,t5_31klt
