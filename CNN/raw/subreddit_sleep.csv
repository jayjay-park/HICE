250572,0,t1_cf6oymm,Well I have similar bouts of angerrageverbal assault. If I have to get up for work or if my girl and I had plans to wake early that day I dont experience it.If Im woken up when I didnt expect to be waking up say for example on the weekend when I was going to sleep in I will yell at her or say something mean. Its like my subconscious is still in control at that point. I am conscious that Im saying it but its only after Ive said something terrible and she gives me the look that I snap out of it. I usually remember doing it whether or not I go back to sleep though so It doesnt seem like that big of a deal to me. I apologize and try to make up for it.I could see how my girl would feel though if I were to say something like I sometimes say and then just not remember doing it. She probably just feels more hurt than anything. She may even think that deep down you have some hate or resentment towards her. Another question I find that I have similar lack of control of my words while Im drunk. Im conscious that Im saying stupid shit but I cant stop it from happening. Do you have any comparable experiences while your intoxicated.,sleep,cf6q5lw,2,t5_2qpyn

2828406,0,t1_cno0rdl,I see lazy doctors with no sleep background order a home test. Then all they see is some simple one page report. from some sleep doc they dont know.At no point does a sleep specialist see the patient.Other times the doctor only cares about the bottom line AHI and lowest blood oxygen. They dont look to see if its position dependant apnea or events with little to no desat but with arousals.I have seen false positives AND false negatives from home tests. Dont get me wrong I think they are great screening tools. I have a couple family members that I want to have home tests. My biggest complaint is seeing some HST systems that dont have a body position sensor and also when they only test one night. I see the apnealink doesnt have a body position sensor.One of the doctors I work for does it the best I feel. Besides seeing the patient he looks at the reports and data himself. Ive seen him bring a patient into the lab because the HST said they had apnea and he felt it was wrong. the pt didnt have apnea. Ive also seen him fight to get a patient in the lab when he feel they have apnea but the HST says they dont.TLDR I think its a great screening tool. But it doesnt replace someone seeing a pt in person. and it has to be used the right way.,sleep,cnpl2c8,2,t5_2qpyn

This may be an old thread but recently I got into a bad sleep spell that Im trying to break.I tried counting upwards and nothing more no special counting speed except that I try to keep each increment in sync with what I consider a second no special breathing technique I try not to move at all but eventually I get ghost itches to which I cave in and have to scratch them.Ive had moments where I reached  and then gave up in frustration only to check the time and see that H has passed. I wouldnt manage to be completely still in the process due to the ghost itches and feeling uncomfy eventually.Any suggestions?

Eating more carbs and calories! I am very active and decided to give keto and paleo diets a try for about  months. What a mistake. It took months to manifest as a sleep problem so I hadnt made the connection at first. I suspect that I was waking so often due to cortisol spikes which were necessary to initiate gluconeogenesis for energy production. Cortisol and sleep dont play nice together nor does it play nice with testosterone since resolving my sleep issues Ive gradually gotten my libido back!.I listed the supplements hygiene and lifestyle steps because I thought they may give you some ideas for fixing your own sleep.Although still not perfect I find that if I make sure I have enough food including carbs by  hours before bedtime get off the computer even with flux at least  minutes before bed take mcg of sublingual melatonin NOW makes a good liquid melatonin an hour before bed take mg of magnesium glycinate and zinc before bed or spray on magnesium oil use ear plugs and a nose strip have almost absolute darkness and dont drink too much water before bed.... I get  hours of deep sleep. Meditation the accupreasure sleep mat a hot shower and flux are all great additions especially for speeding up sleep onset but are not requirements for me.Keep in mind I still feel groggy and want to sleep more when I wake in the morning  hence my post  but by the afternoon Im running on all cylinders and dont feel the need to nap.

4842391,0,t3_3gn2ga,Yes I know the underlying anxiety very well! I had the same when we moved into the very last house on a narrow dead end street in a pretty dodgy area of town. At the back of my mind was the knowledge that we could only leave our house through one way. I used get general anxiety about feeling trapped in a corner knowing that if our exit got blocked off wed have no way of leaving.  We had a gang house living on our street too.. right on the corner at the start of the street. I felt pretty uneasy knowing that whoever was home on their porch knew when we were going home or leaving.I then moved to another house which was a villa divided into A B and C  we were B which was in the middle. We only had  door in and out. This was no way near as bad as being on the dead end street but it was still pretty bad because of the whole lack of control. Once again general anxiety about being trapped in a corner.For me its my natural instinct. Less escape routes feels less comfortable. I would never live in either situation I have mentioned again. Not because I think they are seriously dangerous or pose any real risk but because the underlying unease I felt wasnt something that could be reasoned away.Here is something though that I used to say to myself every night when I was living in the dead end street a mantra even. Hell this helped me through some pretty rough nights where every fibre in my body told me to leave. It just went like this Tonights just an ordinary night nothing unusual going on just going to go to sleep and wake up tomorrow just like every other night Even though it sounds very silly it honestly did help me put things in perspective and maintain my sanity in the process.,sleep,cu4x58z,1,t5_2qpyn

It straightens the shoulders so that they are closer to a normal straight posture. Without the pillow your shoulders will curl forward which is hard on the joints and your spine. Its also helpful for keeping you from tucking your arm under your head. Tucking the arm can do a lot of long term damage to the shoulder joints. Try either putting a pillow between your knees or get a body pillow and do a full on body hug. If you can separate your knees some it will take pressure off the knees and straighten out your hips which will relieve a lot of pressure off your spine. ,sleep,d3hn7s1,2,t5_2qpyn

Where your body releases natural melatonin at inappropriate times. Myself for example releases mine almost exactly at  pm every day. I get very drowsy and find it hard to stay awake. I still feel you should speak with your Dr or your psychiatrist whoever prescribed the Wellbutrin and let them know whats going on. How severe your episodes are. Something is definitely amiss.,sleep,d8nvgsp,1,t5_2qpyn
9248860,0,t1_d8ocns1,Yes now that you mention it Im seeing more bright white street and business lighting in my area.  So sad the sodium lamps arent perfect but they are orange if only pinkish white orange or whatever youd like to call it.Talk to your city council about it and complain.  Get the International Dark Sky Association on your side and have them help you. Talk to your neighbors you might get somewhere.  As for me all I want are some shields over the street lights but I have no clue how long it would take to get through all the stupid stuff Im sure Ill have to go through to get just two of them installed.  Just two.Good luck your mission is higher priority than mine go warm white K if you can!,sleep,d8od038,1,t5_2qpyn
9294426,0,t3_57qbem,Did you taper off slowly? Also it could be REM rebound from lack of sleep. Only cure for that is sleeping more. If you can help it at all try to relax a little bit  nightmares suck but in the end they wont hurt you. Maybe try lucid dreaming too.,sleep,d8u4v8u,1,t5_2qpyn

9440285,0,t1_d9cgayl,Yeah I think so too. I manage to fall asleep within  minutes Id say it was very hard to fall asleep at all at first. Mostly I am able to go back to sleep but sometimes I find myself awake for up to an hour when I wake up. This is a far less of an occurrence as my sleep has improved. Yeah thats what I thought I just wish I could continue to sleep through that.Yep fair enough I might try some of these things. Besides these things I generally have fairly good sleep hygiene. Im thinking I might change my sleep to a tighter schedule from    or even   . It seems my body wakes up at  anyway so why fight it? ,sleep,d9cmfes,1,t5_2qpyn

9482641,0,t3_5anujh,You are probably having too little sleep. You are tired and your body makes sure to black out because you need more sleep.Or you are having unrestful sleep. Check for sleep disorders at a sleep clinic. Sleep apnea can make the sleep very unrestful. You are not well rested in the morning gt you black out.How can you prevent this?Sleep more. Go to sleep earlier.Make sure you keep a coffee on your nightstand or another stim such as modafinil. Get into the habit of drinking the coffee or eating the pill immediately after the alarm clock rings. Even if you black out youll be up and running in one hour.,sleep,d9hxues,2,t5_2qpyn

10003890,0,t1_dbbj7pd,Thicker curtains would also work.  A sleep mask wouldnt stop the sun being on your skin which will still have a bit of a wake up effect.  Are you having to sleep during the day or does it just get light really early there?,sleep,dbbjae7,1,t5_2qpyn

10270971,0,t3_5n06oq,I have almost exactly the same problem and background and came here to ask for help. I wake up about  hours after I went to sleep and I dont feel particularly groggy but I am suspicious if that is enough. Today was the final straw  I woke up after  hours of sleep and couldnt fall asleep again. And today I already feel much more fatigue. My lifestyle is very similar to yours I dont have any stress related to work of family and I practice meditation which helps me clear the mind which should in theory make me fall asleep faster. On the meditation subreddit I read a while ago that sleep duration very often decreases when people practice meditation and I know that there are outliers who need less than  hours of sleep but I dont think I am special and all the studies indicate that  is the very bare minimum for the bell curve of the population.,sleep,dc89rf7,1,t5_2qpyn

I never got deep sleep if there was light even a small amount creeping in.. Is your room quiet enough  too quiet? Another thing impacting my sleep was sound. My room was  of the time compelely silent which amplified the slightest of sounds. I run an air cleaner at night now as a white noise generator in addition to its intended purpose and my wake ups at night over a random sound have gone away.,sleep,dcwv58n,2,t5_2qpyn

11357773,0,t3_61dixe,I have a method I use to help me fall asleep not sure if it will work for everyone...I noticed years ago that as I was drifting off my brain would randomly fire and I would hear like you hear your own thoughts people I interact with in life mainly at work saying verbal souplike phrases that made no sense. Usually incorporating my name into the sentences. I would also see in my minds eye random objects floating through empty space just as I drifted off. I assumed this was my brain randomly firing and drifting as I fell asleep.So now I emulate that in order to induce it using a little bit of selfhypnosis on the way. The goto system which I assume is specific to me is that I envisage a big elliptical black portal into which I will send items that I summon at random. The key here is random. The first thing that pops to mind summon it up and send it in. For some reason the first item to get me started is always a coles shopping trolley. No idea why.Ok so thats all very specific to me but the message is to figure out what your brain does as you are drifting off to sleep and then find a way to initialize it. Its not a catchall but it helps me get my brain ready for sleep and works over  of the time for me.,sleep,dfjdse9,1,t5_2qpyn

11423680,0,t3_631t23,That could be it. Its known that people who pull allnighters or work the night shift go into REM more often REM rebound. Id assume they also go into deeper NREM for longer periods as well.,sleep,dfqv2hm,2,t5_2qpyn
11460513,0,t3_6353sh,Ive had similar problems. What I do is I try to get  hour offscreen time before I go to sleep. The light of the monitortvphone keeps the mind awake. So in this case I meditate or read a book before a I go to  to bed. It also helps to take a shower. Something that I realized that was important is to have my room at a lower temperature than I normally have in my room. This means also that my sheets and pillow have to be cold. This implies that I havent laid down in my bed before I go to sleep. This is also a generally good tip to use your bed ONLY for sleeping no reading no watching tv etc. EDIT Also to chill I use ASMR it is really calming. Thats was the preparation. Now the most important part is to try and train your brain not to think about particualr stuff. It generally helps me to not think about my day previous or next. Not think about chores and so forth. My mind comes at easy when I think of abstract stuff and here the keywords are not to focus on anything in particular. Just let your mind wander. Sometimes this technique works really for me. ,sleep,dfv1iig,1,t5_2qpyn
