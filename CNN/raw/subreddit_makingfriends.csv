3367104,0,t3_2yn0i1,Asking people if they dont want to hang out with you is totally counterproductive. It puts them in an awkward defensive position and causes them to lie and resent you more. Thirty minutes may not seem like a lot but thats an hour of commute time to hang out with you and if you can be selfloathing at times its a risk that theyll come over and youll be unpleasant to hang out with. If youre genuinely depressed thats something you should actively work on. But honestly it sounds like theyve already made their choice they told you theyd hang out with you after your surgery and they didnt. They dont call. They dont initiate hang outs. Im sure its super tough but you need to make new friends and not resent them for being better friends with each other. Pursue hobbies take a class go to the gymall the tips that are always given on this page. But dont keep pursuing them and looking desperate and dont confront them about not hanging out with you. It wont work. ,makingfriends,cpc2pxd,1,t5_2rsc3

7525551,0,t3_49qt7p,I think that something in your head and weird sense is a bunch of insecurities. I need you to develop an IDGAF attitude and encourage yourself and your friends to be upfront and honest with each other at all times  if you got a problem with each other speak up or forever hold your peace. They will let you know if they got a problem with you otherwise just be yourself and dont worry about it. Whether they like you or not never be afraid to walk away be alone or make new friends when the time comes.,makingfriends,d2xm92o,1,t5_2rsc3
7955505,0,t3_4o477r,Youd better hurry up and find some friends that are independent of their partners soon!!! It only gets worse as your s creep into your s. I have some friends that are impossible to see because of their partners and others who I can give a little notice and theyll find time to hang out every time I ask. Guess who seem like happier people that have stronger healthier relationships??? Take this as a lesson for your own relationships. Dont give up your own personality and interests when you date someone and dont forget about your friends!,makingfriends,d4a9uuj,1,t5_2rsc3
