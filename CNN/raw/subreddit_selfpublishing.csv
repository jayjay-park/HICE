5661361,0,t3_3icywi,Came to this late but I sell at conventions.Dont bother with codes. Noone at a con has time or inclination to redeem a code or even buy an ebook and they wont bother when they get home. People want physical product in their hands and have money to spend in cash. Get print copies and book a dealers table. I have done this a few times at conventions to which Ive been as a punter and its made a modest profit more than happened when I bought a load of bookmarks and was touting an eonly strategy.,selfpublishing,cwyuh9f,1,t5_2sr55

6954653,0,t3_4auxz0,A couple ideas subscribe to the Writing Prompts subreddit. You dont have to post but at least do a promptday for fun. Give yourself a set amount of time to write. Dont not worry about finishing. Just get the writing done.  Keep a journal. Even if its not fiction the more you write the better.  there are also books out there with fun writing prompts. Check your local library or Amazon.  get together with other writers. I cant stress this enough. Its great to get feedback on ideas writing critiques etc.  remember that its going to take a while until you really truly find your voice. Dont rush it. I know it can be discouraging at times but just keep working on improving. Youll have some peaks and valleys but ultimately youll improve.  Kill your babies. A writing friend recently said this to me. When youre working in a story or novel writers will become extremely attached to their work the way it is. But its really through tough editing and making smart choices that youll really be able to get your writing to the place it needs to be. This is the hardest part of writing really. Well that and actually carving out the time to sit down and write. ,selfpublishing,d14n5qf,3,t5_2sr55
