1008009,0,t3_20d7k9,As soon as you become a member of WWOOF Sweden you can read what WWOOFers has said about the hosts. But I would also recommend you to ask yourself what you are interested in wrkinng with building stuff growing veggies taking care of animals being on a farm that is in its early stages or an old farm with lots of experience? You can see in each profile how long each farmer has hosted WWOOFers. Check out this blog that explains how the community platform works. ,WWOOF,chiv9qb,1,t5_2sboy
1112402,0,t3_26t1jz,For emergencies I just took my normal contract phone and put some pay as you go money on it. Pretty expensive tenpence a text or something daffy but better safe than sorry if you end up out in the sticks with some nightmare farmer who only harvests imaginary wombles or something.,WWOOF,chuql9u,3,t5_2sboy

1384453,0,t3_29xxzu, I made a good friend last time I WWOOFed who was about your age. Im  myself. Ive got my own land now and am a WWOOFer host and my prospective WWOOFers are of all ages from  year old kids to much older parents.Dont fret the small stuff. Age matters a great deal less than personality.,WWOOF,ciptoip,2,t5_2sboy

3334512,0,t3_2ybf39,Awesome thanks guys! Im getting pretty excited about it. Ive been pretty sheltered my whole life so this will be a pretty big step out!,WWOOF,cp8czb3,5,t5_2sboy
3358089,0,t3_2ym6ob,I was just in Norway last month for about a week and a half. Not too long but thats because there isnt too much to do on most farms during the winter. Though there might be a type of farm which is very active in the winter Im not sure. ,WWOOF,cpb1p98,2,t5_2sboy
3379068,0,t3_2yvusp,What do you mean? Yea sure some farms like it some accept it some dont give a shit and some dont allow it. Remember that farmers arent usually personally bound by state laws Ive worked for and with the most conservative folks in the most conservative states and they didnt care what I did and Ive worked for and with the most liberal folks in the most liberal states and they lit up with me.,WWOOF,cpdftda,3,t5_2sboy

3525935,0,t1_cptqpu8,thanks for the info i keep on going back and forth on whether this is for me i am just worried of being stuck in a remote place with people who might be armed or crazy and wont let you leave or what if you do not do a good enough job and they make you leave in the middle of the night in a remote place have you ever had to leave unexpectedly ,WWOOF,cpu6jm5,1,t5_2sboy
3547560,0,t3_30vb8t,In WWOOFing Ive learned how to be more flexible when it comes to the workday how to get along with diverse people and to appreciate where food comes from more deeply than I would have by just reading about it.On a farm there are s of things that need to be done and as a wwoofer you might end up helping with any number of them.  For example I helped herd and slaughter sheep in England something I never thought Id do.  I also held an old goose while the farmer chopped its head off killing it quickly and mercifully.  That was an eye opening experience about where our meat comes from.While wwoofing Ive worked with people from all over the world and while in France I had to learn to use my very basic French to get by and understand the hosts.  It was a challenge but a very worthwhile one and Ive become more adaptable and willing to take on difficulty than I was before.  Farm work doesnt always follow a strict  schedule either and there were long days that really tested my notion of what hard work was.All in all its made me worldlier a little tougher more open to new experiences and more aware of how our modern st world gets its food.,WWOOF,cpwn7mg,3,t5_2sboy
3725484,0,t3_32x37v,Say youre backpacking all around?  Thats what I did,WWOOF,cqgxii3,2,t5_2sboy
3775202,0,t1_cqmlh0v,So again it doesnt really matter whether you WWOOF or not. If you do WWOOF you might have to answer questions about the Gap On Your Resume but your answer would just be I volunteered on a farm in New Zealand it was an incredibly enriching experience blah blah blah. If you dont WWOOF youre sitting at home unemployed anyway.Blowing your savings on backpacking and traveling to multiple continents all over the world when youre unemployed sounds wasteful though.,WWOOF,cqmln0x,1,t5_2sboy
4488701,0,t3_3ckr80,How did you converse with your hosts especially the second family who took you out places do you speak French? If not how do you think this affected your experience?,WWOOF,cswgo1r,5,t5_2sboy
5925491,0,t3_3wdq00,Hey great post you seem really enthusiastic! Im looking into WWOOFing too Ive never done it before but I plan to do it august September next year hopefully in Europe somewhere. Anyways I just wanted to recommend a couple books I read during my final months at home before leaving on my first trip. How to travel the world on  a day by Matt Kepnes really really good advice in here. Everything from booking flights to eating cheap. Talks about WWOOFing and other similar things in here. Solid practice advice. Vagabonding by Rolf Potts definitely more inspirational. Tips for getting into the correct mindset for traveling how to get over your worries and keep up your enthusiasm well throughout your trip and the rest of your life. This book definitely took me by surprise. I believe he briefly talks about WWOOFing. Also allocate some YouTube or Netflix time to An Idiot Abroad. Also Anthony Bourdains stuff. And Rick Steves. All great people to watch  listen to. You can learn from them. Many may disagree but get in the habit of digitalizing your life. I dont travel with guidebooks they are heavy. I gather info on the Internet and save it on my phone WiFi is literally everywhere. I dont use maps they make you stand out as a tourist and easy prey. Get familiar with travel map apps. Much better to just act cool dont mind me Im just checking my phone even though in my head Im wondering where the hell I am. Personally I just use Google maps. Its never failed me. Make sure you have online banking Skype etc all set up. Free calls with whatsapp and Google hangouts. Tons of tips like these in the first book I mentioned. Most importantly is to keep that enthusiasm up! Dont psych yourself out lol. Anyways Im back at home now after a trip more than happy to share some advice. Pm me! ,WWOOF,cxwd2j9,1,t5_2sboy

6460126,0,t3_4451ot,Hey! Im also in a similar situation actually but I have no experience WWOOFing  so I dont know how much help Ill be. However if you are interested there are other sites like wwoof that offer similar services. Maybe you can din something there. Helpx and workaway . Hope thus might help.,WWOOF,czniqgw,3,t5_2sboy
7169705,0,t3_4dlx2i,I went to Norway as well two years ago for a couple months its a wonderful place! As for your questions you can stay a max of  months in Norway with no visa and as far as I know they dont give you visas for WWOOFing. Ive looked into moving to Norway its a very long process. Last I remember you need to be sponsored by a company to get a work visa then live there consecutively for  years before you are eligible for citizenship. Or you can find someone to marry. ,WWOOF,d1t4mmn,4,t5_2sboy

7719311,0,t3_4l1gt8,It all depends on your host and agreement you have with them. Some places where there were three or more volunteers wed get two days off a week sometimes together but most often separate other places where it was just me or with one other person time off was more limited. One farm in Israel allowed for me to take ShabbatSabbath off Fri afternoon  Sat evening because I kept Judaism but because my coworker didnt he got the same amount of time off from Sat afternoon  Sunday evening.,WWOOF,d3jms9o,2,t5_2sboy

9727658,0,t3_5efqhw,So long as you are willing to learn and to work hard youll do just fine.A lot of work on a farm is simple enough to do but it just takes time and effort to get it done.  Thats why WWOOF exists.,WWOOF,dac5as7,6,t5_2sboy
10364685,0,t1_dcf1vtv,I have a lot of self worth. I actually plan on staying in my own country and WWOOF ing is completely customized on the volunteerhosts. Youd get plenty of free time if you took the time to negotiate. If you dont want to do it then dont and dont be a complete jerk when presenting a dissenting opinion. And if WWOOF ing fits your definition of slavery you need to crack open some books and learn some new things. ,WWOOF,dciwdj1,5,t5_2sboy
