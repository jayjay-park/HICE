2787644,0,t1_cnkwlil,At first about VABSPH but the pitchyawroll thing makes sense in both places.,ksptomars,cnky1nq,1,t5_35soy
2799278,0,t1_cnm9874,looks great!,ksptomars,cnm9n4b,1,t5_35soy
2799517,0,t1_cnma3gt,I meant airlock not docking port.,ksptomars,cnmam9f,1,t5_35soy
2804162,0,t1_cnlc5ss,Personally dont see how SCANsat makes sense... I mean... If youre sending people to Mars you would normally have a plan for where theyre landing before they leave. You dont decide that when you arrive. Mars has already been scanned.,ksptomars,cnmtnqo,1,t5_35soy
2835091,0,t1_cnqb9h2,Yep I agree well be doing a mission control brief in a couple weeks,ksptomars,cnqcgln,1,t5_35soy
2837190,0,t3_2skfg7,Oh nice! It has a selfie stick ,ksptomars,cnql2na,1,t5_35soy
2837954,0,t3_2sl158,Please note that the mission brief was updated per the edit in the main post at  AM EST.If you havent checked the mission brief since then please reread it carefully as there were many important updates.,ksptomars,cnqo77w,3,t5_35soy
2846931,0,t3_2sp6zn,Chatterer may be included in the streaming pack but as it is not a part mod essential to the mission or requested for construction I decided not to include it in the main modpack.,ksptomars,cnrp1ou,2,t5_35soy
2959371,0,t1_co4fdft,Specifically I was looking for like the launch profile you used to get them into orbit. For example. Full throttle until Km. At Km pitch  degrees to the East.. At Km pitch X...... etc.Since you have tested so many of these I figured you could give me some pointers as to a profile that works for you if this is too much information to gather dont worry I dont want to overwhelm you. I can check some NASA documentation to see if I can get some decent  plots but from a programing standpoint it would be HELLA easier just to follow a simple set of instructions like this.I am also working on a new PID system to control my rockets which will work out wonderfully if I can get it working properly.,ksptomars,co4htnh,1,t5_35soy
3050367,0,t1_coe5lu0,OK I think I understand. So you are still working on the MDV then right?,ksptomars,coe637e,1,t5_35soy
3278776,0,t1_cp1yull,Yes. I tested it with the APAS  port but I believe they are all the same size. If the solution is going to be to place a tank there Id rather we do it manually. Maybe well put a life support tank there or something. ,ksptomars,cp2095r,1,t5_35soy
3282762,0,t1_cp2ae4v,Thats awesome man! Good luck!!!,ksptomars,cp2gmqi,1,t5_35soy
3361387,0,t1_cpb8ihr,gtWill I need to make any changes to the orbital Hab because of this? Are there any other changes I should keep in mind with this update?Its disabled by default.  You dont need to make changes this is just a way of demonstrating ingame the usefulness of the BA  and the large surface habs once I write the configs for them.  gtI havent been adding tanks for waste at all to the hab. Should I? And if so how large should these tanks be?Theyre only needed if you have TACLS processors.  Some of them will only run if there is available tank space for waste or waste water but TAC automatically vents excess for Kerbals.  Of course theres no reason to carry the waste all the way with us so I made a vent part. gtThis is awesome and will be very useful! Thanks!Thanks!gtThanks! This will make reentry much safer for our astronauts! If I have some free time I will run some tests and see what value I think this should be set to.Its mostly figuring out what will give us a good lifting reentry.  At . the craft tipped so far over that the heatshield no longer pointed down.   obviously means no lift.  FARs inflight menu could probably help you guys a fair bit.gtI dont personally dont think this will be necessary. Personally I think the APAS looks fine on the taurusWe need to use the same docking port as on the MAV and I dont want to fool around with changing it.  Also I want to try my hand at modding ksp eventually and figuring out this part gets me a bit of the way towards actually making my own.  As it is Im kinda burnt out with trying to figure out the MDV and this is a good break.  ,ksptomars,cpbf8r3,1,t5_35soy

4241219,0,t3_39fk0j,Just finished it today. It was alright. Id give it  stars at best. Snowball type plot. Dialogue was atrocious and sounds like it was written by an adolescent teenager. Matt Damon was a brilliant casting decision.,ksptomars,cs3ow16,3,t5_35soy
4249196,0,t3_39eh3k,Hi guys Id love to help out! I just graduated high school so I have my whole summer free. I run multiple online businesses and Im going to uni for international commerce next year. I have  years of D modeling and design experience with of course my full suites of programs and equipment etc. I am a talented graphic designer product designer and have some self taught engineering skills. Favorite course in school is AP Physics. I havent done any programming but I am quite skilled in part modeling. Please  let me know if I can help in any way!,ksptomars,cs4lj5c,3,t5_35soy
4368733,0,t1_cshais3,I second the redditors design as the flag used as a planted flag or logo on the fairing. But maybe we need to make Mars white as well since .. you know .. well be on it at that moment ..,ksptomars,csi3abd,2,t5_35soy
4377695,0,t1_csiubh5,Yes but at the expense of some Earth departure delta V you could reduce overall mission time with an EarthMars short stay  Venus Earth profile vs an EarthMarslong stayEarth profile. You could also reduce your Mars arrival velocity and Earth arrival velocity with this profile according to this paper. From the example they used                            xxx | Earth Departure V kmps | Mars Arrival V kmps | Mars Departure V kmps | Earth Arrival V kmps | Mission Duration days|||||Earth Mars Earth | . | . | . | . | Earth Mars Venus Earth | . | . | . | . |    So theres a moderate increase in departure delta V . kms total and a moderate decrease in arrival velocity . kms and dramatic reduction in overall mission duration.I think this idea merits more than  just a cursory look. ,ksptomars,csj3oda,2,t5_35soy
4406423,0,t1_csmadyn,If you could get more precise data than what I have which is currently like  px per Km it would be nuts. I think I could get to extract data from Google Earth but Im not sure. What would be epic is to convert the MOLA maps to greyscale but as you said its impossible.,ksptomars,csmc6qp,1,t5_35soy
4845537,0,t1_cu5apaa,I just checked the original thread on the interview and i believe the idea is to do a Hangouts and record it answering my own previous question then possibly upload it to YouTube. As for the format Im guessing a questionanswer with one person designated to ask him questions based on previous comments.,ksptomars,cu5be7z,1,t5_35soy
