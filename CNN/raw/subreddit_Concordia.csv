765321,0,t1_cgr34xa,I think it really depends on what faculty youre in. I dont know anything about the Anthro faculty but I was very satisfied with the engineering education I got. Overall I enjoyed my time at Concordia and Ill be sad to leave graduating this semester. It also depends on you. If you dont get involved and dont make an effort to inform yourself about events and such you might have a bad time.Youll probably be at the downtown campus which I hope youre ok with. I loved being right downtown but it does become a zoo sometimes. You should definitely take a free tour sometime if you can get up to Montreal.As for the  CAD what are your other options? I definitely think a university degree is worth it just make sure youre going into the right program!.Montreal is awesome for students. Half of my friends went to McGill and the other half to Concordia so I was super spoiled when it came to the parties and events because I had double the exposure.Also if money is a factor Montreal is probably the best city in the world to study in. Youll have affordable rent be surrounded by events and be in the city with the most students per capita in North America.Best of luck to you!,Concordia,cgr9tiw,1,t5_2rsnl

3239927,0,t3_2x5r9l,I cant comment on poli sci but I have had a few courses in the liberal arts and in history. My liberal arts classes incorporate poli sci to a pretty large degree. They are small personal and the profs are all amazing. As for any courses I have taken outside of the college such as history and other social scienceshumanities they have all been shit. I dont want to generalise but that has been the trend. My history courses have been hardly challenging and most of the other class members are abysmally stupid. It is for that reason I am thinking of going to McGill seeing as I love history. In short liberal arts at Concordia along with a few other programmes such as the sciences and engineering are fantastic. While most of everything else has been shit in my experience. I can only hope that McGill provides a better overall quality of curriculum.  ,Concordia,coxtptq,0,t5_2rsnl

3802217,0,t3_33yj4r,There are no teachers at the university level theyre professors. Theyre not there to teach you but rather to guide you or maybe clarify something for you. Theyre not going to challenge you show you how to learn or push you  youre in university to do that to yourself. Blaming your professors for downright destroying your future is as irresponsible as it is outright lazy and a perfect example of a selfserving bias.Those TAs that you have can help you if you contact them and ask the right questions  they are more like you than you think undernot funded graduate students that are unimaginably stressed out and busy but are more than happy to help another colleague thats you! out with the material and share some general guidance about the university experience source I am one of those stressed out grad students that marks around  assignmentsessays at a time its difficult but I nearly get emotionally attached to my students and write a million comments and suggestions on the papers of students where effort and promise are shown. However coming to the TAs office and asking what to do or how to pass or just saying you think you think should get a better grade without a reasonable argument is not going to get you anywhere even if you get the grade  think about it.Yes some professors are just shitty. Some of them dont give a flying fuck about lecturing or are poor public speakers and do not know how to make personal connections with students. These are people that were hired for the job because of their publications or potential for furthering the institution through their research. Its unfortunate that more universities dont focus on teaching but the reality is that they get their funding through research and having an active faculty that publishes regularly is more important. However having a shitty professor is not an excuse to not learn anything or write off your university experience as some horrible money grab. There is a reason that you are there and that professor is there. You were chosen out of hundreds of potential students because it was evident that your knowledge and skills were above average therefore there is a chance that you would succeed in a more selfdirected academic environment. That professor is there because they stood out from probably nearly one hundred PhDs that applied for the job and are absolutely knowledgeable in their subject. Talking to the professor outside of class handing in exceptional work and distinguishing yourself as a stellar student are ways of increasing your chances of this person knowing your name.In the end you are and you arent learning anything in a four year Bachelors degree. You are acquiring a rather general base of knowledge in a subject of your interest that could potentially lead to a specialization and deeper knowledge in that subject. What you are really learning however is how to learn analyze and think critically. When you get your degree it will say B.A or B.Sc. or whatever it wont say your major or minor or anything else and it doesnt need to. What it shows first and foremost is that you are a competent person with critical and analytic skills  which is something only you can teach yourself provided you an in an environment that allows it guided by people who understand it. For some people university is an extension of childhood in that they fuck around like they would in high school except with usually more freedom to do what they please but really it is a litmus test for life in the real world and how things actually are  namely to see if you are capable and competent enough to solve things on your own with full responsibility of doing so onto yourself. Blaming others around you  your professors the university the system etc  says more about you than it does them. Sorry for the tough love but the internet is the best place to hear this stuff.edit holy gold!! THANK YOU! D,Concordia,cqpole7,53,t5_2rsnl

4013309,0,t1_crddv69,My own suggestion you need to know that I work offcampus would be to only take  POLI classes. Lets say for your first semester you could take POLI    and .Given that you are an international student and I know that most of them wont ever work offcampus during their time here at Concordia I guess you would be fine with  classes. Although if you start volunteering...it may be difficult to have a high GPA since youll be busy doing something else. Four POLI classes and one elective for an international student would make sense IMO. Be careful though it all depends on what you plan on doing during your next academic year.The classes arent that difficult if you put the effort into them. ratemyprofessors.com will become one of your favorite websites when you will have the opportunity to choose your classes. It could make a major difference between an easy and difficult class. POLI    and even  were not really difficult and the four of them are mandatory courses in Political Science. I havent taken a level class yet!I would suggest you to take Bisaillon for POLI  and professor Huelsemeyer for POLI . My two teachers for  and  were amazing as well but they are not coming back.

8951327,0,t3_52t960,From GPA overall introduction paragraph...In the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science prerequisite courses required for admission to a program will not be counted unless they are specifically listed on the students acceptance letter.From Final Graduation GPA section...additional credits in extended programs are not normally included in any calculation and repeated courses and transferred courses are treated differently than they are in the Annual or Cumulative GPA calculations. In the case of transfer students all courses taken at Concordia will be included in calculating the Graduation GPA except in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science where only courses which are part of the degree program are taken into account. This GPA is calculated and recorded on the record only when a student graduates. The Final Graduation GPA is used as the basis to determine eligibility for High Academic Achievement.Unless I misunderstand something. It says additional credits in the ECP do not count. Then it says prerequisites required for admission do not count either unless specifically listed on the acceptance letter.Honestly the wording is terrible and vague.Hope this helps. ,Concordia,d7nte76,2,t5_2rsnl

9726911,0,t1_dabt6se,Its hard to do well when your instructor cannot include the basic criteria for an assignment. An assignment they already provided a handout for but somehow neglected to include a key part of it.Make whatever comments you want I know my grades thus far and I feel confident that this is really the instructors issue to rectify. Universities are supposed to hold their staff to some basic standard of being able to communicate effectively to their class.However it seems like you have a specific opinion that is not going to change despite not having many details about this situation.

11316361,0,t1_dfeo1iz,Alright well Im with Taleb so Ill respond from the perspective of taking his class. Nothing in Comp  is necessarily difficult however the professors go through the content quickly and dont give students sufficient exercises to practice. On top of that Taleb explains the content of his course extremely poorly.I did an online course on Java during the winter break which embodied most of the content that is in Comp  so its been a breeze. The course I took had  exercises which let me really understand the topics so much better than Concordia could with  labs and  assignments. I think its very normal to be having trouble if you went in to the class completely blind.I would recommend you use youtube for anything you have trouble with or are unsure of. If you have no clue how methods work? Youtube it. Not sure how Arrays work? Youtube it.Classes may seem a bit overwhelming but it is actually very simple. If you need help for your assignment regarding classes let me know I dont mind guiding you through it.From what Ive heard. Nancy is by far a better teacher but is quite a bit harder. My friend sent me her midterm and it was a lot more difficult in comparison to the joke of an exam Taleb gave us. Due to that I wouldnt worry that you did poorly on it. Taleb said he curves the grades a lot and that he would take care of us so I assume Nancy is the same. If I was you Id stay in the course do your best and then spend your summer revisiting everything using online resources which explain it much better alongside exercises and making sure you understand it. Dont change discipline because youre overwhelmed. Its very normal that you are.,Concordia,dfeow6o,4,t5_2rsnl
