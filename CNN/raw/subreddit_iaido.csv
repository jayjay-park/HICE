2503136,0,t1_cmlan3p,Niten Ichi Ryu also has this in a kata whose name translates loosely as Lots of Happiness. They start from a standard chudan and move in this manner with the idea presumably being that you get your hands out of the way of an incoming kote strike. With your arms out like that you look very joyful and happy.This explanation doesnt seem to work for this kata however.,iaido,cmlaql5,2,t5_2qo5t

8714894,0,t1_d6u2egq,Keep in mind that if you really want to be serious about your training in one or both arts you will need to make the time. Once a week may be fine at first but you will want to add more days as you progress and there is only so much time in the week. Good luck!,iaido,d6v001h,1,t5_2qo5t
8715440,0,t3_4z8kqo,IMO theyre fairly different in concepts.  Traditional Karate tends to be fairly rigid and linear with a lot of hip locking and square stances.  Depending on your style kumitetype competition might have useful footwork concepts but its more of a vestige of the kendo influence and some styles like Kyokushin would be fairly unhelpful.  The concept of kime is also something thats very different in karate compared to iaidokenjutsu.  The former tends to involve hip and body snap whereas the later in my experience is more about the flow from extensioncontraction.IMO softer arts like Aikido or Taijiquan have a better integration than Karate.  ,iaido,d6v2gtz,1,t5_2qo5t
9148959,0,t1_d8bd9gl,But are you actually protecting the body when you bring the fist in front of the face before rising? My feeling is that it would only protect your left shoulder leaving the top of the head exposed. By raising the hand directly you are protecting both the head as well as your left side. ,iaido,d8bp3rb,2,t5_2qo5t
9473925,0,t3_5ah48w,Heres a trick I used to correct my sword angle. Take a rope and put a weight on one end just something light to give it some momentum. Grab the other end in your left hand and lightly with your right like a sword. Bring your hands over your head like youre getting ready to cut but let it hang down your back. Youll want to swing into something like a couch or something so it doesnt swing back up and hit you later you can tighten the right hand at the last moment to grab the rope but youll probably do it early and mess yourself up at the beginning.... Try to focus on your left hand doing the work and only keeping a very light grip with your right as its only along for the ride. Try and keep the rope straight i.e. dont let your right hand start deflecting the rope this means you are using it too much. In time you can use a slightly better grip and your right hand wont deflect from the line your left is defining.Finally to apply when swinging the sword think of the FRONT of the sword as that rope. Swing it the same way and the back should just follow out of habit.,iaido,d9gv6gk,4,t5_2qo5t
10800661,0,t3_5ubvr6,I use balsa for the sides harder wood for the part that might come in contact with the kissaki and Gorilla wood glue. I put sandpaper on a block of wood and rub the shim back and forth to make it thinner first. Then glue into saya with the habaki holding it in place. I usually have to follow that up with an Emory board nail file to get the fit right. Advice on cleaning the saya out first is spot on. ,iaido,ddu0f89,1,t5_2qo5t
10942477,0,t1_de8h2vp,gt...be careful if the police ask you to take it out if they are allowed to do so. In airports I always ask to go somewhere private like an office and Ill unlock and open everything but Ill never take the sword out. Let them do that if they want to.Thank you!This is the kind of practical advice I was looking for. The local association doesnt often pay much attention to actual current events outside the world of Kendo Iaido. Yes its always been safe to transport swords here but that was then this is now. If I knew anyone socially in law enforcement I would ask but would hesitate to approach a stranger in the current political climate.,iaido,de8n0xc,2,t5_2qo5t
