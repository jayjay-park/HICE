Conquest. It has the same name in both Battlefield and Battlefront. Really the only difference is that its almost asymetrical because each faction in Battlefront has special units and weapons that the other team cant use whereas in Battlefield each team is differentiated by the flag or colour of the dorito above their head post BFBC,StarWarsBattlefront,cqd1ufp,11,t5_2u9wz

3736124,0,t1_cqhk3ax,Are you seriously comparing a game over  years old to one released in ? Games today require a lot more resources to meet the standards of the modern gamer. Those  maps werent exactly the pinnacle of map design. Quality trumps Quantity. Even if we only get  maps which we wont its been confirmed there will be more than  at launch you can bet they would be much more detailed than the ones from battlefront . I know you must hold those old games in high regard. I loved them too. But Galactic Conquest was just instant action reapplied to to have some continuity through matches and space battles in Battlefront  had some good ideas but in my opinion werent as enjoyable as the ground battles. I much preferred the way it was in battlefront  which is what were getting in the new one.No Clone Wars is really a result of Disney and the direction they are taking Star Wars.

3788241,0,t3_32y66x,That is indeed quite disappointing. But what turned me off of this game as in I am not fucking preordering it was DICEs rather bullshit excuse as to why they were not including space battles. They were saying that the XWing Fighters and TIE Fighters in the sky ala Battlefield. I love that this looks like a Battlefront game but after seeing said excuses I have a feeling it will feel like a Battlefield game reskinned as a Battlefront game.I do realize that the previous Star Wars Battlefront games were in a way smaller versions of Battlefield games BUT they still felt like a Star Wars Game. I do not think DICE can deliver the same feeling. And excuse me DICE space battled are just as much of a part of Battlefront as ground based battles. I will link said interview with DICEs two developer members but here are some of the excusesIts not much about space Most battles are planetary battles so our focus right now is to make sure we only get that right. The core of Star Wars battles  the Endors the Hoths et cetera  you want to take that to perfection. You want to do it right. Patrick Back DICE General ManagerBach continued Space is hard right? Not from a development perspective but from a logistical perspective. Is that fun? For us it doesnt make sense to create a battle above you if youre fighting other players who are not there to fight. Our focus is to do planetary battles.No space battles. Its all about the epic planetary battles and getting that right. Fighting with XWings and TIE Fighters we have that. Its taken in the atmosphere. This is something we discussed with Lucasfilm and they were happy to be on board with that.  Craig Mcleod Battlefront ProducerSaid link Unless they add said feature between now and November and if the game rates good then MAYBE I will purchase it. But the removal of such a fun and integral feature that was part of many childhoods including mine and Battlefront is a dealbreaker for me. In my opinion this is what happens when the special Star Wars Universe is handed off to an uncaring and unfaithful developer DICE and publisher EA aka Unicron. Rant ended.

Since  DICE has been owned by EA and most of the devs have changed.While SWBF had lots of Battlefield s mechanics I wouldnt call it a clone. It runs on its own engine and had bots in multiplayer. Kill times are longer in SWBF than they are in Battlefield  Rather than a clone SWBF was more of an improvement of an older game.Even if it was a clone it was a clone of a damn good game.

3941944,0,t3_35lo9m,Listening to some of the complaints I feel like people have a really rosy view of BF and . I recently reinstalled BF and started to play the multiplayer again. Holy shit the game is chaotic as fuck. Its nothing but nade spams dying in mere seconds after spawning and etc. Hell classes are uselessannoying. For example a ATST is attacking you so you switch to anti tank. Once the ATST is destroyed you have nothing to defend yourself besides a shitty little pistol. I also played as the support class and started dropping health and ammo and either no one saw it or just died constantly that it wasnt needed. I feel like people are remembering the singleplayer mode than the real multiplayer mode. The single player was a lot slower paced and the ai isnt as trigger happy or nade happy. It still was a fun game but completely different than what I remembered. Also side note everyone bitching about space battles trust me they arent as fun a you remember them. They are nothing but shitty dog fighting and dying in the hanger of the enemys ship before you can even get out of your transport ship. Battlefield  slowly turned into one of my most favorite FPS games and it has plenty of chaos but in a way thats not  that overwhelming like BF so I have hope for this series. ,StarWarsBattlefront,cr5m5uw,55,t5_2u9wz

3952939,0,t1_cr6t1q4,Thanks for the reply Jeremy. Sorry for the confusion.  Im new here.Lets hope someone from DICE like DICETheBikingViking... can take the time to answer this question about a Battlefront Integrated Clan System.This will be a critical issue to me and many of my online Clan Leaders and friends looking to include Battlefront as one of our competitive online games.  If Battlefront doesnt have a complete Clan Supported System... then theres no reason to purchase the game for many thousands of members in Private online International War Clans around the world.  And that will be mountains of lost sales for DICE and EA.Maybe this new Battlefront from DICE was designed to be a simple dumbed down version of a space game and not to be taken seriously as a real online competitive game for Tournaments and Sanctioned Competitions.  And I DONT mean ESports!Online Organized Gaming War Clans have been competing against each other for many years with games that support Clan needs.  If Battlefront cant do this... then I guess this game is meant for kids and anyone looking for some laughs.  If so... my Clan members and friends will save our money for a real game that has Clan Support.Maybe DICE will smell the coffee as they make Battlefield .

3971734,0,t1_cr72cwf,well esports history may sound a bit big but yes there was a competetive scene in both swbf and swbf pc only ofc. you can check out the swbf hall of fame here  there was an european swbf section in the esl until  and later even bigger sections for swbf with a german section and of course an european one which was open until . the game was later even added to the versus system to regain some activity and there were some cups later in  to test if they should reopen the section but it didnt work out. in both games were many problems within the community within the game bugs and with the esl admins what resulted in the game dying.i dont think there ever was any prizemoney or big tournament just some esl premium to win which at least would cost some money. it was mostly justfun but it still was a great time. there have been all modes you can imagine on on on on on even on ladders and cups most of them capture the flagmode or conquestmode but there even was for example a hunt or space ladder amp cup. also there have been swbf wallpaper and movie eslcontests  in general there was a quite big editing and moviemaking scene within the community for a long time if you keep in mind that the playerbase was decreasing all the time. during the good old times many teams and clans were founded some of them started in  with the beginning of swbf switched later to swbf and do now still exist and have expanded to other games. so if you dont know about these times you definitely missed something D,StarWarsBattlefront,cr90efr,2,t5_2u9wz

4043386,1,t3_36ufni,I actually completely agree  with this article including the part with the ATAT. And no Im not trolling. The reasons he stated are exactly why I thought DICE would not include hero units. Instead I thought they would replace the hero system with an elite unit system where instead of playing as characters like Vader and Boba you can play as an elite unit like a Rebel SpecForce trooper or an Imperial Galactic Marine or a Shadowtrooper. The one thing that turned me off about Battlefront  was that it had random Star Wars characters darting around where they didnt belong. Luke was in a snowspeeder during Hoth not on the ground mowing down thousands of snowtroopers. I would much rather have the iconic Star Wars characters in ingame events hearing their quotes from the movies if the appropriate action happened or have them make a brief cameo appearance on the battlefield like having the Falcon do a flyover. Things like that would help retain each characters legendary statures and would further immerse players on the battlefield as soldiers fighting in the battles from the movies.  I was hoping this Battlefront would take this sort of approach and I have to say I was pretty disappointed when Vader showed up in the trailer but Ive since adjusted my expectations. Im still incredibly excited for this game. Im just hoping the cast of hero characters doesnt get too out of hand like having Admiral Ackbar running around. As comical as it would be I dont want that kind of stuff in the one game that has the chance to let me live out my childhood Star Wars fantasies. The only thing I have to say further on the matter is if I ever found out that DICE was at one point thinking of implementing a system like I mentioned above but didnt because it would be considered too much like Battlefield or not enough like the old Battlefronts I will forever be depressed. I give kudos to the author for having the balls to write an article like that especially seeing how ravenous the Battlefront fanbase has been about wanting DICE to stay loyal to the original games lately.,StarWarsBattlefront,crh6dwc,0,t5_2u9wz

4323158,0,t1_cscxnm0,I remember this discussion from the first weeks Battlefield  launched.Some maps like Rogue Transmission had map borders that only allowed you to fly for about  seconds from side to side before entering the red zone.Other maps like Paracel storm have absolutely MASSIVE areas of  by  kilometers which allow you to fly for more than a minute before reaching the other side at max speed.People got used to it very fast and just adapted to it by flying higher than normal. I do hope they change this though IF its true that you cant turn fast enough before exploding . as he described it which sounds like the thing someone who cant fly would say.Its never really been clear why they choose to do this but im guessing its got something to do with hardware limitations.I hope they expand the borders in battlefront to allow for more complex manouvers and large scale battles.

Everyone knows the films more or less but the Expanded Universe had written out something like  year after the end of ROTJ.

4730577,0,t1_ctql30j,Actually they DO owe us something  a game which matches our expectations for a Battlefront game. Granted some people are impossible to please and have unrealistic expectations but those arent the majority. At the end of the day theyre selling us a product not doing us a favour. Perhaps if more people actually held DICE to a certain standard instead of defending every single change and buying so hard into their hype for a new Star Wars game which is exactly what publishers including EA want to sell you a game before its released by getting you excited not necessarily by making a great game then they might be inclined to reconsider their approach or actually listen to fans. ,StarWarsBattlefront,ctqtxgm,8,t5_2u9wz

Call me entitled but I think that maybe we should expect x the player countmap size along with  times the memory.Maybe add bots to flesh out the game? Have bots fill out rank and file stormtroopersrifleman and have players take on special roles like driving vehicles engineers squad leaders heavy weapons. No instead were going to have a charactrer model that has so many pixels and such complex animation that the computing power used to run the last game is purely used to animate  dude running.Seriously what does the new game add? AI is just as retarded vehicles are the same gunplay is the same old maps arent any bigger. Seriously in what  way is this more than a graphical upgrade?

I hate to say it but that VO and some of the dialogue sucks real bad for some of the Heroes. I have no idea whats instore for Han or Fett.Admiral Akbar sounds pretty decent though from what Ive heard so far however!because everything is after all subject to change until release Fingers crossed this is just for the Beta as a kind of placeholder? and that DICE are continuously working on the HeroesVillains VO AND dialogue until release and just put this together quick so theyre not silent during the Beta.I am pumped for Battlefront I truly am but if this is final VO work its a real disappointment.Sound design is such an important part of a video game and everything else sounds awesome especially the dubstep grenade the Tiefighters the actual VO for the soldiers and just about everything else in this videoWould be a real let down if this is final VO for the HeroesVillains I doubt it is.

5324081,0,t3_3nwulq,One thing I noticed was that the rebel ships can use their shield ability to kill TIEs by collision.  Awing makes a sharp arrow.What Im curious about is how much the evasive abilities and missiles differ between the four fighters.  Do they have different cooldowns?  Different damage levels?  Are TIEs in Battlefront less durable than the Rebel ships?Also since youll be able to choose to fly either faction fighter in Fighter Squadron Awing or Xwing TIE Fighter or Interceptor I assume they are designed to be balanced.  For Awing and Xwing Im sure Awing has the edge on maneuverability while Xwing wins on firepower.  But what about TIE Fighter vs. Interceptor?  Interceptor has four guns to the Fighters two  does that mean the TIE Fighter is more maneuverable or quicker than the Interceptor?,StarWarsBattlefront,cvs7oro,1,t5_2u9wz

One of these mustve triggered the audo bug a An orbital launch near the shield not on it thoughb My teammate deployed a turret the one you can use inside the shield and started shooting from inside and of course all the bullets didnt go trough the shield.The only solution I think works right now is restarting the game.

5331094,0,t3_3n703u,I hope not. My personal opinion is that mode like HC just cause dissention in the community. It is best to just have the ability to search for servers running different settings than to call things HC Normal or whatever. As it is now we often see people that are HC fanatics argue with those that are not and vise verse. If you remove those game modes names then you have a great chance to remove the animosity we see between the community over such things.ampnbspAnyways... This is Star Wars BattleFront. How much different do the game modes need to be? You should really only have one style and play on that one style. Do we really need to remove UI elements and change things like Health and all that? How much do those things really impact this game here? It is not like it is BF. This is a rd person scifi shooter after all for the most part. the appeal should be Star Wars really. Not something like HC vs Normal.  I think they should keep it simple and not try to over complicate things.Just my opinion and just a thought. ,StarWarsBattlefront,cvt3v7g,-2,t5_2u9wz

Also autobalance please.Overall Im really not sure if I want the game or not I was super hyped and now I just like it.

5347176,0,t3_3o9ech,Coming from Battlefield I had the same problems you do.Like in Battlefield throttle control is key even more so in this game since everyone is flying at ridiculous speeds. To keep yourself alive you have to find the sweet spot to turn without loosing too much speed and becoming an east target.Depending on your platform you have buttons to do evasive maneuvers. There are important for upcoming missiles as this is the only way to shake them they also work to throw your enemy off the loop. Each time you do one of these stunts a part of the meter on the bottom of the screen is consumed use these with timing.When engaging an opponent from behind lock on them by using your alt fire and holding it this will aid you to shoot him with your blasters to shoot him down a little dot will detach from your reticule and it will indicate where the blasters are gonna hit you have to maneuver your ship to make the dot hit the enemy ship. Its tricky but with practice youll get better.You also have to be lucky to not get destroyed in the animation in with you arrive and can  control the ship be wary of enemies trying to spawn kill you from behind as soon as you spawn as you are already vulnerable to enemy fire.Also every ship has different stats steering perks speed and duration so its a little difficult to be consistent you have to get the feel for each one of them. My favorite are the XWings for example.Hope it helps!,StarWarsBattlefront,cvv5uhi,3,t5_2u9wz
5347444,0,t1_cvv6sw9,Yeah I can see that being an issue. The game does unfortunately have a lack of depth but I really hope thats just down to the beta.

5386055,0,t1_cvzpq49,Then be disappointed with it and end it at that. People seem to act as if the world is falling apart simply because DICE didnt faithfully recreate literally everything from the previous two games people have nostalgia goggles and memory bias crying over the lack of a Campaign  yet neither of the two Battlefront games had any sort of a good campaign it was mediocre at best and largely consisted of fetch and defend objectives. I also see a lot of people whining over the fact that its too much like Battlefield yet both of the previous games pretty much mimicked Battlefield pound for pound. Does anyone remember capture the command post? Seems oddly familiar with that of DICEs conquest mode doesnt it? Keep in mind that Battlefield at the time came out in the same time period as Battlefront just as a comparison. People also seem to be missing the fact that this isnt Star Wars Battlefront  therefore DICE doesnt owe any sort of homage to that of the previous two Battlefront titles. This game is a reboot DICEs creation of what they think an authentic star wars experience should be. Whats ironic is that for the longest time people petitioned DICE to take the reigns given that the original creators of Battlefront is long gone their argument was that both Battlefield and Battlefront are very similar in playstyle and gameplay and they are no doubt  but now that its here people are complaining that its like Battlefield so either way DICE is in a loselose situation with a fan base so jaded and butthurt that they didnt get an HD remake of SWBFII. The elitism and entitlement is very real with the Star wars fan base people had high expectations and that is something DICE would of NEVER lived up to regardless. People cried winced and largely begged any developer to take on a new Battlefront title for the better part of a decade now its here and that expectation people had will never be fulfilled and that isnt DICEs fault. ,StarWarsBattlefront,cw04niz,5,t5_2u9wz

Domino Squad is reallyAnakin was a  times more likable in the series than he was in the prequels and it gives some more background into his eventual fall to the Dark side.Say what you will about Ahsoka they gave her great character development.

5481540,0,t1_cwca3rw,The way the industry works pre planned DLC isnt half as bad as Day  DLC.  Games usually have to be done about a month before their release date sometimes more to get that build to the publisher so they can start printing it to discs and advertising.By saying okay we want to do these things in the game but its not feasible before the publishing deadline well put it in DLC that means they can focus on polishing the core game as opposed to overstuffing content into a broken game.  Would we rather have this extra content for free since it was planned to be in the game anyway? Sure. But I also like the idea of paying people for their work especially if theyre going to be working on the game for quite a while after its release.Day  DLC though has to be done at the same time as the core game.  So basically it couldve been in the core game but they ripped it out. Either for retailerconsole exclusives or for an extra charge.  Which is always bad.Tldr preplanned DLC is fine.

If DICEs intention for removing helmets to see the face behind the helmet was like you mentioned...  not feel like they have to be locked into the position of a trooper ... they shouldve done something like this. Face is shown they stand out among their troopers and its a much more sensible skin along with it being another customization skin.Playing as a Stormtrooper basically puts forth the idea that youre fine with being this anonymous military force  a staple of being a Stormtrooper if you will.

I mean seriously?And dude Vader had some limitations on his suit but it still gave him advantages others did not have.  His suit was created using Sith traditions and alchemy that gave it additional power beyond what it granted through technology.  The point If he was attacked by Force Lightning.. Well duh.

5670786,0,t1_cwzssp2,gtIts a bitter pill to swallow because we know they had the technical knowledge to make it happen. We can only enjoy the experience while it lasts which I think wont be all that long  maybe a couple of months with a surge around the time the movie comes out.Quite the contrary. The fact that this game is much smaller than that scope indicates to me DICEs intelligence and awareness of scale in projects. Given only a bit over two years to work on this brand new project rather than reskin it they instead decided to try to create really strong polish with much smaller scope so they can nail that down. In a future installment now that they have that nailed down they can use it to create a sequel with much larger scope. If they had started with the larger scope from the start the end result from their relatively short development time wouldve been an unpolished shallow mess. They can also add elements of depth without resulting in unintended sloppiness.Yes this game may lack heaps of content but if thats the biggest complaint then DICE will be like Thats easy to fix now that our core product is fun!,StarWarsBattlefront,cx00mg1,3,t5_2u9wz

I am not a native english speaker but what I meant by saying some not nice words is that I hate EADice game releasepolitic and I know most of the EADice studio workers had nothing in common with it. I am an Journalism and Marketing student and also a gamer with  years of experiance and I know how todays biggest titles are being prepaired to maximize the incomes Destiny  if you know what i mean  not always ofc but with the incomnig new Star Wars movie I can see why there is not enough content. The game is gr and I had tons of fun playing beta and I wish I could play more of Star Wars games but with the recent contentfacts I think it is unwise for some who live in a west Europe to spend so much money on a game that does not have a proper amount of content. Even tho I have money for it. My friends also share my point of view so even if I would buy the game still my friends probably would not. And Multiplayer games are best with friends. Regardless of all I said I WILL buy the game Star Wars fan here  maybe when the GOTY edition will come out or when the price will drop.Anyway  Id like to apologize the DICEstudio worker for for using such a harsh vocabulary.

5778770,0,t3_3uan5e,Ive played bf for years now. Star wars battlefront doesnt compare. There are no only in battlefront moments because there is no freedom. The maps and multiplayer battles are scripted and linear in Star wars. You cant even choose a spawn point. There is no mini map. Can you imagine a battlefield game with no map or spawn points? DICE specifically said in an interview that freedom doesnt always equal fun and they purposely stripped players of many core freedoms they took for granted in the battlefield series. That is subjective to the user. Star wars battlefront is an arcade shooter for young kids and star wars fans who enjoy linear battles. The gameplay is nowhere as in depth or content heavy as bf. The gunplay is completely different. No classes either. When dragon valley drops for bf for free Ill be retiring star wars for a while. I can play bf for many hours and it still feels fresh. Star Wars I play like max  minutes before Im well bored. And Im a huge star wars nut. TLDR Its nothing like bf. Yes its fun. Gets old quick. Linear. No freedom. You play a movie. Not a game. Too immersive. Dice went full immersion. ,StarWarsBattlefront,cxdesu7,2,t5_2u9wz

Mostly though I use the same hand give or take a change. I dont tend to overplay my Star Cards to be honest. I know that that probably cuts down on some of the kills I get but I just dont find many of the Star Cards that fun to use.

I agree that the game is lacking conent with no space battles galactic conquest or clone wars but i completely disagree with the ton more maps argument. Battlefront  had  land maps and the designing quality and depth between most of those maps were pitiful. Only a handful of maps were really favored. I prefer quality over quantity and DICE certainly has given us  quality maps that have depth behind them. After Dec  the maps will only be a difference of three maps so the difference in map count is not that great. ,StarWarsBattlefront,cxeujai,4,t5_2u9wz

Maybe he also has a super scan pulse type thing I Sense Something. Reveal all enemy locations for all your teammates.

Is it me or did they take out classes?Me they didCg I cant wait to see what they did with galactic conquest! I bet itll be massive now!Me There isnt one. They also only put  worlds in the game so I guess it wouldnt have made sense anyhow.Cg WHAT?! That was the highlight of the single player! And only  maps...!Me no there are like  maps just on  planets. I agree I miss galactic conquest more than any part of the game.Cg Well lets try instant action so I can get more of a feel for the game before we try multiplayer. What? Is it battles or survival?Me neither. Battles is a team death match with the AI and survival is just killing waves of bots with the occasional objective.

Can I play as a different faction?Me NoCg And this is a full priced game?Me yup  bucks CanadianCg ffs Multiplayer better be spectacularopens multiplayerCg How do I make so I can do clones wars?

A lot of people seems to think that if you queue for a game mode and cant find a game it means that nobody is playing that mode. This is not true it means the servers with people playing are full. What I do when the group search fail I just requeue until someone leave one of the full server and boom I am now in a full group. Sometimes I need to requeue several times but I never end up having to play a mode I dont want to. Yes the matchmaking system sucks but there is always people in all mode there just might not be room in their game when you queue.

Thousands of problems can be fixed by restarting a program or restarting an OS. There are bugs in the code which you can run into. For example you join a game think oh sht I want another map leave while at the joining screen and join a different map. This backing out triggers a bug after which you cannot find any game anymore. Restarting the game fixes that and you start to find games again. This is just one example.Please go back to school man and stop harassing me.,StarWarsBattlefront,cy2nazn,1,t5_2u9wz

And if games were to be priced based on content not all AAA games would be  for the most part.I personally have  hours into Battlefront and Im still not done with it. So for less than  per hour of entertainment Im more than satisfied. And even in GTA V well over  hours. So yes to me I wouldve gladly paid .

A big black ball with some stars a sun and a planet is too easy to make and wouldnt really wow people. You know what does wow people? Flying over the Jundland Wastes on Tatooine and having to strafe through canyons to avoid enemy missiles. Or better yet combining dogfights with regular gameplay allowing players to attack on two fronts the air and the land. In the air you can rain down lasers on ground troops. On the ground you can watch your teams fighters zoom over your head and launch ion torpedoes at enemy fighters to help your fellow pilots.

6110821,0,t3_3z705e,Forget about the KD its a team game and the point is to complete the objective to win for your team. While some of the people who commented on here just hang back to allow their team to go for the objective there are others who have no idea whats going on and wont go for it. Decide what role you want to play. Do you want to be the guy who turns the tide to allow your team to win? On Hoth walker Assault I went all the way to the back and got in the Laser Satellite looking thing cant remember the name sorry it does tons of damage to the Walker if I hadnt done that we wouldve lost. . Do you want to camp and clear up the battlefield in the hopes that your team will be smart enough to get to the objective? Based on what role you want to play you will choose your load out and also depending on what side you play as Imperial or Rebel scum. I hate to give away these tricks but heres a few things Ive learned.As a Imperial you only need to turn off the Uplink before it completes so if you want to help your team complete objectives equip the Personal Shield plus Smoke Grenade. It takes some practice and getting to know the maps but most times you can jetpack throw a smoke grenade prevent lockon from homing missile and blocks view and activate your personal sheild while in the air. As you land quickly hold x to deactivate the uplink. The personal shield and smoke combo is the best for this. You also want to equip Ion Torpedo in your other load out to deal with Enemy ships like Awings Xwings and turrets. Simply locking on to the enemy is enough for your tie fighters to weaken and destroy them usually. Without ground support its very difficult since AWings and Xwings are very over powered. When you get in an ATST think about what you want to do do you need to push forward and destroy a lot of rebels so your team can deactivate the uplink? Or do you need to hang back and use the Ground to air missiles to disrupt the Rebels air game? When I see someone in the ATST do that I go back there and use my Ion Torpedo to lock on to AWingsXWings. This really annoys the people who love to camp those powerups you see the same jerks going for it over and over. By the time Im done these people usually wish they had never seen the power up or knew what it was. Ive had people message me because theyve obviously gotten so mad I screwed up their game. They love to camp those and get easy kills to improve their KD. I will make my own thread with some other tips. ,StarWarsBattlefront,cyk8knq,1,t5_2u9wz

I personally have experienced multiple deaths in a row from a bowcasterjumpack player.  It can be a tad infuriating and I understand why a lot of people dislike encountering players using the combo.Its especially frustrating to go up against high caliber players who make good use of the bowcasterjumpackbounty hunter trait.  When I first started playing the game I didnt understand how they were able to use the bowcasterjumpack over and over again with seemingly no cooldown.  As a casual player with average skill and low rank I admit it does take some of the fun out of the game.I usually just sigh and keep trying to push forward.

6217398,0,t3_40qeek,Its actually my favorite mode but it definitely needs some tweaks. I agree with what youve said but in addition More variety in ships you can choose. Tie Bomber TIE Phantom or a Black eta  or V Wing for the Empire. BWing and YWing for the Rebels. New hero ships Luke in a customized XWing or even Dash Rendar in the Outrider. The Empire should definitely get Vader in his Tie Advanced. A set of flares to throw off missiles Id imagine theyd function similarly to using a dodging maneuver. I feel like the enemy shuttles need more time in play in addition to health or defensive weaponry. If you die right before or as it spawns youre not getting to it in time.,StarWarsBattlefront,cywcnz4,3,t5_2u9wz
6217435,0,t3_40pclw,It makes me feel like Walker Assault can be fixed by beefing up the ATATs a little and making the Tow lines easier to break. As for te AWingsXwings I doubt DICE would ever change the mechanics so alterations to speed mobility power etc... are a nogo but maybe theyd make it so that Rebel Ships at least cant use weapons while shields are active so no more onesided games of chicken. As for HeroesVillains Vader needs more mobility as it stands hes useless in open combat since he cant escape fire is jump is a very slow joke with a bad punchline. And the Emperors Basic Attack the Force Lightning needs more range to often other players simply outrange him and using the force propulsion only puts him in far more danger by closing in on enemy groups. As for Boba Fett the rocket doesnt need to be a homing attack but it does need to move towards a target like Lucky Shot or Saber Throw too often people miss by an inch and watch as the missile smacks into the ground with no effect simply because the target moved slightly to the side. And Flamethrower doesnt need more range but it needs better coverage a wider damage threshold to cover a wider AOE in front of Boba. These arent fixes that balance the game but they would help. In my opinion.,StarWarsBattlefront,cywctf6,2,t5_2u9wz

6350992,0,t3_42k1ty,A lot of the problem comes with the openness of the larger maps. Teams are generally still forced to spawn in one or two designated areas and a lot of the time theyre close to objectives. This does two things makes spawns predictable and easily reached for enemies. On smaller gametypes like Droid Run and Drop Pod the game constantly changes objective sites switching spawns more often than is desired often leading to the infamous gunintheback spawn. Overall Id give spawns a C. Theyre just barely below average. FPS games today have pretty crappy spawns overall so BFs bad spawns arent uncommon but the frequency with which I get shot before being able to move makes it below average for sure. ,StarWarsBattlefront,czbjcrd,1,t5_2u9wz

Walker Assault  Supremacy  Dropzone  Blast  Cargo  Fighter Squadron  Hero Hunt  Droid Run  Heroes Vs Villains  Turning Point Overall Private Matches gives players the ability to join games with only their friends clans family etc. It functions the same way as our MP modes do now.For players wanting more singleplayer content we have new Missions maps incoming and the team is looking into ways to bolster the offline gameplay offering.

As far as time to die I dont mind going out in a hail of explosions until I spawn on the other side of the map make it almost back to the action and then somebody camping the ridge kills me again.

Grab the cargo and run. Then use barrage to leave a trail behind me to damage anyone chasing me. If I cant communicate with my team how else can I get in there with no help? Its a team mode and we cant communicate with each and  of the people worry about there KD ratio then the objective. They didnt need to nerf the Bowcaster completely where it wont even kill  person.

I led the charge against the rebel scum. Flying up close getting all up in their bubble and melting all the yellow snow surrounding them. Yep funnest thirty seconds of my life. My team never even tried to take the uplinks or anything. This wasnt even just the first ten minutes it was the entire match. Id be one of the few people on my team actually trying to attack uplinks and defend the walkers. The match was over before we ever got near stage three. The next map we played was Tattoine. I grabbed the AWing and managed not to die in it all three rounds and took out ships ATSTs and imperials running around outside not as glorious as it sounds Im not really that great a pilot the entire match the uplinks were never live.

They want to make as much money as they can from this game and stripping it down and selling it in parts is the best strategy. Most of the time the DLC and updates come out to coincide with the release of other games or their respective updates. This is done to keep people interested in the game and to make money. The new Far Cry game comes out later this month and hey so does the next Battlefront update. You can see how this process is handled in that in this new update we will be able to play the Turning Point mode on all of the big maps. You can argue that Turning Point shouldve been available on all of the big maps when it was released along with the Jakku map but the damage is done.

Nerfs where they dont belong broken weapons and cards DICE actually advised using the jetpack and an explosive weapon to rain down fire on enemieswhich got us this  this is just some of the bullshit weve put up with. On PC the game is practically dead and the singleplayer is so half assed its not even worth doing unless youre one of those completionists who has to get every piece of the diorama a feature I dont remember ANYONE asking for. Between a shit rd person camera monumental lag and horrendous matchmaking again primarily on PC its fair to be a little worried about the state of the game.Now they confirm only  new characters and announce  of them are Greedo and Nien? If they want to include them so be it but for the love of God dont piss around the issue of exclusion. The quote the inclusion of one thing does not necessarily mean the exclusion of another is a load of bunk. If you arent going to exclude TRULY ICONIC heroes dont say youre only adding ! Tell us that our childhood heroes will be in the game!DICE just needs to trust US for once instead of begging us to trust them. WE HAVE trusted them WE HAVE preordered WE HAVE bought the season pass. Why cant they just tell us what we are buying?! What other industry asks you to buy something and refuses to tell you what is in it? I know the expansions will be outer rim bespin and the death star and an as yet unannounced expansion. I know that new modes and maps will be added. I know that new weapons and powers will be added. But when it comes to something as central to the game as Heroesthe very thing that sets Battlefront apart from every other shooter out therethey cant give us some reassurance that TRULY ICONIC characters not these pathetic excuses will be included in this  game. ,StarWarsBattlefront,d0oorto,0,t5_2u9wz

6884974,1,t3_4a1afw,I know this is insane but I honestly havent enjoyed this game as much since they nerfed the DL. Theres no denying it was OP but it really was a fun gun to use and not just because it was so good in comparison to the others. There was a certain tactile quality to it that I find the other guns in the game both before and since lack.At close range you knew exactly what it took to get a kill with it but you could only get those shots off so quickly before the recoil got the better of you. There was a certain rhythm you had to tap into to be effective with it and it wasnt hard to do but it made each kill feel so rewarding. Since the patch I swap back and forth between it and the DH and I still do about as well as I used to but I just dont find it as rewarding. ,StarWarsBattlefront,d0wq8f9,1,t5_2u9wz

7179170,0,t3_4dn695, agree. This is the first game Ive cared about in years and one I want to succeed. The first few months made me nervous considering how small the PC community was. So many players got turned away from the game at the beginning because of the lack of content. If anyones on PC you should give this game a try if you dont have it already... Id like to play Fighter Squadron more but besides balance it suffers from not being objectivebased.

7286650,0,t1_d26fb16,I think since there are so many lightsaber characters in Clone wars that they should change how Heroes work a little. I think there should be  types of Heroesvillains one lightsaber type and one blaster type so on game modes like walker assault you could have  heroes per team but only one lightsaber character each. So you could do Genonsis With dooku Jango Fett and droids vs. mace windu commander Cody and clones. Itd be a great way to utilize more characters and make the Jedi sith and grevious better than the blaster heroes. ,StarWarsBattlefront,d26fypz,4,t5_2u9wz

This never happened before could have just been a fluke or it could be that most of the players were focussed more on KD than winning the game?Something like an adrenaline boost when you are inside the objective ring for supremely would be good faster regen faster cooldown less damage from explosives something along those lines could be a good incentive to get people in to the ring of death.One thing I have noticed in objective based games like this is that you get way more kills at the objective itself anyway.,StarWarsBattlefront,d279gu4,0,t5_2u9wz

7450523,0,t1_d2p185i,Im sorry I have a history in game design so while it seems obvious to me it may not be for others.The hero and villian abilities are made to counter each other for the sake of balance.Luke counters vader both have lightsabres melee force push counters force choke dash counters lightsabre throwLeia counters sideous both heal other heroes or drop powerups as well as both being powerful up close leia gets a shield so people have to get close to her palpatine has a dash so he can get close to themHan and Boba counter each other lucky shot and missile ranged flame thrower and dash for up close.Greedo and nien nunb high senses counters augmented turrets precision shot counters rapid pulse cannon dioxys counters prox bombsThis is game design .They dont just randomly assign abilities. If they add another melee character for heroes they then have to add one for villians.Btw they do use some things from the prequels. The thermal imploders the shields some guns Slave I etc. Not giving Sideous a lightsabre was a tactical decision,StarWarsBattlefront,d2p2szj,1,t5_2u9wz

Probably the beach planet and city environment from the trailer as map locations.  I would expect the beach planet to include a WA map and be large scale.

7735984,0,t3_4l9co1,I agree that the game is lacking depth. It was really lacking depth at launch four maps for large game modes was a crime in itself but releasing the game without Chewbacca was just blasphemous and I will never forgive them. and although it has gotten a lot better it still lacks depth. I mean Im happy with the game and I love to game for hours but that said I dont think anyone comes to this game and is amazed by the amount of content. The quality of content sure but not the quantity. Mos Eisely is one of the maps that desperately needs to be added to this game. Personally I think that we will see it added eventually whether thats part of expansion  or just a free DLC. I think it wasnt in the base game because the game was rushed to launch alongside TFA. Creating a large Mos Eisely map would be very time consuming because they could not construct urban environments with the same technique they used to create all the landscape and terrain. Jabbas Palace had to be completely made the old fashioned way in program rather than through the photo scanning process. Imagine how much more work this would be to create a huge city. I think DICE will try to make up for the lack of this huge want from the community by releasing a large urban warfare map for Bespin but ultimately the community wants a Mos Eisely map and I think eventually we will get it,StarWarsBattlefront,d3lixy7,10,t5_2u9wz

Players choosing a hero and playing back when they should advance my partners almost never having upgraded cards or charge cards and some pretty decent runs as a TIE against rebel aircraft.

7809951,0,t1_d3tr6u8,If they did a reskin of the original Battlefront games it would be infinitely more successful.The class system worked well and if you put a limit on it that would be fine. Youre forced into the narrative for these battlefront games with seemingly pointless objectives for the big maps when all people want to do is kill each other. Just throw  people on a side with a big map have a stock of say  and just go at it. Just shoot shit and kill people. Thats more fun than  people playing hardcore for an objective and  people running around trying to kill everyone else. Offline content would have been key a server browser would have been perfect but EA is so set with what they want.

A work has to do a lot of things to qualify as Parody including being transformative to a degree that its producing commentary on the original but this game is NOT it. Its a directly derivative work built on things that this dev has not licensed from anyone.Again I love the idea I miss old battlefront and the promise of what BF could have been is amazing.

It actually makes the problem worse.Youd just end up widening the already enormous gap between regular and more casual players even more.  For each card or set of charges a more casual player would earn the more regular players would be earning twice as many as they already do a much faster rate.

There were issues at launch and the game probably should have been released after the jakku update but it was still worth its price to me. I dont like the dlc easing pass model but the one good thing about it is that you know how much you can potentially spend upfront. I wonder how many poor suckers are going to spend thousands on overwatchs microtransactions because they have to get a certain skin or something. Also I hate EA but I think that you can see the passion from the actual devs in this game though. I have had so many amazing moments in this game.

Do you think other people dont work over  hours a week at jobs they hate? Its the profession they chose. If you dont like it go do something else its not like there arent hundreds if not thousands of people out there who would gladly take the job. Theyre selling a product and they sold a poor one at that. Dice is no small company and yet the released a game that has some of the least amount of content out there. The flagship mode walker assault shipped with  maps. Thats pathetic. The character customization is a joke. And its not even like these are all new game modes. This game does pretty much the same thing every other shooter out there does. Its really shitty that people get called entitled for wanting a game thats is the value they paid for. Everyone is so quick to defend Dice despite one disaster of a launch BF followed by a game that has a pathetic amount of content for being a MP only game. If they want peoples money they have to earn it they arent entitled to it. I dont care that its a MP only game I care that it shipped with less maps than COD who also manages to put out a game with  different modes or Overwatch who while only having  maps also has  different heroes who all play differently. Dice shouldnt be all entitled anyones calling them lazy then should produce a game thats worth the  they charge and work on rebuilding their reputation. ,StarWarsBattlefront,d4g6jld,1,t5_2u9wz

However Sabotage is excellent can be won and lost from both sides loadouts and prioritizing objectives plays a huge role new drop zone is awesome and IMO should be retrofitted to vanilla maps.

8040438,0,t1_d4ji27n,Their playlist is terrible. The whole segregation concern is wrong anyway. That concern is about the difficulty of dealing with the fact that some players will own ALL DLC some will own just number  some just  amp  some just  amp  etc.Its too hard to get servers going if theyre that numerous varied and fractured.But when were talking about a SINGLE DLC they absolutely can and should let people filter themselves into their preferred game modes.Players are doing it anyway by quitting out it just works terribly.The single playlist approach is absolutely a terrible fuckedup attempt at a solution.More playlists per DLC would actually make it BETTER for populations...the Outer Rim playlist will stall out and be unable to start a game when an unpopular mode comes up because so many people quit. With more playlists at least when a HvV or whatever game got going youd know everyone in the server wants to play HvV and theyll stay in round after round.DICE should make several playlists per DLC. Mixed mode only on that DLCs maps new mode only like Sabotage on that DLCs  base maps dedicated popular modes WA Extraction etc using that DLCs  base maps Season Pass large amp small mixed modes lists on ALL DLC  base maps etc.Or a server browser.,StarWarsBattlefront,d4jtjyd,1,t5_2u9wz

8093926,0,t3_4q350e,This is a small glimpse into the thought process of the EA executives justifying expensive DLCs.

If you can stay out of the way of the villains and just keep chipping away at their health for the whole game you will not only probably win the game but earn a metric buttton of money. I recommed Nien Nunb and Greedo for anyone looking to make a lot of money as Greedo does a ridiculous amount of damage and Nien has his proxy mines and turret to rack up that damage for him.

I may have to try that combo again now that ES has been nerfed. Im also very interested to see what impact the DLT buff will have to this equation. It seems to have been equal with the RTC at long range except for the fact that the DLT has less upwards recoil the difference at close range is the RTc has a smaller time to kill due to its  higher rate of fire and max damage but the DLT can fire a lot more shots before overheating so it can actually kill more enemies before it overheats.

Gameplay wise Id have to agree the new battlefront is more polished in terms of the actual gameplay. Bf always felt clunky and clumsy. Dont get me wrong I loved those games but I find myself enjoying the new one far more because of the diversity in modes Fredom of load out options the presentation and yes the graphics. Honestly I think the biggest gripe people have with this deep down is that they have not created any clone wars content. I understand the frustration because I share itthe community has because its such a ripe era of the SW saga almost tailor made for games like battlefront yet we get nothing.

He places the blame for the death of BF squarely on FR and their lack of ability.gt Also the failed to meet milestones bit is not fair to FRD. LucasArts simply wouldnt pass them along milestonesShort version you believe the FR guy. the guy who hilariously claimed that the game was  ! done and when challenged eventually grudgingly backtracked.gt And yes I do think they were competent. Anyone with half a brain can see that Free Radical were screwed over by LucasArts and were robbed for  months of unpaid work.No anyone who believes FR. Notice how Im not insulting you directly here will you be able to do the same?. But given what happened and the war of words the FR guy is simply not believable.gt Notice how the former LucasArts guy never mentioned his name? Do you reckon that that is maybe to do with them not being  truthful in his response and having other devs call himher out on it? The FRD devs were more than happy to give their names... If the former LA guy is still wanting a career of course hes not going to give his name. Employers dont like employees dishing the dirt publicly as a rule. Especially one as controversial and disasterous as BF was. You mean the former FR dev. The one who IIRC was a cofounder who tried to paint his old company as a victim. Bearing in mind that the other cofounder again IIRC doesnt even work in gaming the guy clearly has an axe to grind and doesnt seem professional enough not to lie to protect FRs memory.Short version I think hes full of shit and his initial claim of  was so laughable he instantly lost all credibility.

8534615,0,t1_d67zgp4,So do you have low expectations for the devs most important game of all time?  It doesnt seem like it.I do have very high expectations for this game and the sequels.  When I play them I shouldnt be able to come up with about a million different ways to improve it not just change but actually improve it.  That makes me question DICEs ability to conceptualize and then test the game modes weapons mechanics before their release.  As a general gamer I shouldnt have these questions and I dont with other games...  Maybe a few but nothing brings it out in me like EABF let me tell ya.  With Battlefield Overwatch Cod I dont feel this need to contribute to the concept pool or offer ways to better it.  I understand those games are what they are I play what I purchased but Battlefront isnt established yet so that there is an expected feel to it when the next one comes out.  At least I hope it isnt because there are so many featuresaspects I want to see done completely different from the current status.  Lastly the SW title does in fact make it special and above other games.  I completely disagree with you there.   million gamers wouldnt have spent between  dollars on a game without knowing hardly anything about it if that wasnt true.  Many expected Battlefront  yes the Free Radical trailer literally brought tears to my eyes and in part that can explain the massive drop in DAUs within the first couple months past release.  There are obviously many other reasons for the DAU drop but I wont go into it here.I will agree that this EABF  could never be what I envision it should have been.  The devs do an excellent job at listening to the community and improving the game via patches and I couldnt be more grateful for that.  But although the outside graphicssounds mainly of this game are beautiful I would happily trade them for vehicles on the ground better lightsaber mechanics bot integrated planetary assault modes actual alien creatures on the maps rancor wampas ewoks etc better customization ground to space combat without a second thought.   ,StarWarsBattlefront,d68e556,-2,t5_2u9wz

Its more like Super Easy  Hard with no in between. I want a casual experience that isnt as challenging as hard but not as ridiculous as Normal mode if that makes any sense.

9032228,0,t3_53xmn6,If youre playing on Xbox then there shouldnt be any cheating. The KD ratios that you gave for example are pretty average in this game. Especially if youre on a mode like Walker Assault or Supremacy where someone can be a vehicle whore and just camp spots waiting for AWing tokens. Its much better than it used to be but it still happens.Heres a few tips I always give newcomers. ALWAYS shoot from the hip. Never zoom. If you play COD then you are used to using zoom as a way to get more accurate shots. Not the case in Battlefront zooming in actually does not increase your accuracy at all. It only slows down your movement which means that you cannot strange effectively when zooming. And let me tell you what  strafing is essential in this game. The blaster fire has to be lead unlike COD where your shot will immediately hit wherever your cross hairs are aiming so strafing becomes a very effective counter when fired upon as it makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to lead their shots on you. . Also different guns are great at different ranges. Figure out what guns you like to use and what range they are best at. Then ONLY engage enemies at that distance. For instance in close quarters combat the CA is going to win any firefight. If you have a medium  long range weapon such as the EE or Relby then for god sake do your best to engage enemies at a medium to long range distance rather than at close range where you will lose. If you are running the EE which is a great short to medium range weapon then engage people at that distance. Dont run out in the open on a large map where gents probably have lots of snipers and heavy blasters capable of shooting long distances at a large damage output. If youre running a close to medium range weapon on a large map then move from cover to cover and engage enemies at distances in which you will win. And if youre playing on a tiny CQC style map then get a gun thats going to shine in that setting. It takes a lot of time to figure out what guns are best at different ranges and then on top of that to find out what guns you really like and are comfortable with within their ranges. Give yourself some time. Cut yourself some slack. This game was pretty controversial at launch to say the least so a large number of the players that had the game at launch have quit and moved on it has gotten SO much better since then through constant patches and updates. So remember that majority of the players youre going up against have been playing since launch. Theres a lot of die hard players out there with over a month of game time logged. Youre going to have issues going up against them because Battlefront does have a learning curve. Just the shooting mechanics and leading your shots takes time. Learning to shoot from the hip takes time. And ranking up and unlocking better weapons and star cards takes time too. The game can be pretty top heavy because the longer you play the more things you can unlock. And of course the more you play the more experience you have which makes you better anyways. So in a lot of ways the advantage is stacked for the veterans and it can be frustrating as a new player. But DONT give up... This game is literally incredible once you break it in. . Play with a partner! In game you can designate someone in your party as your partner. This gives you a huge advantage because not only could they explain things to you if youre using mics but also in game there are advantages as well. For instance you can respawn on your partner. This is a HUGE advantage when trying to capture an objective  if one of you gets killed then you can just spawn back in quickly on the other one before they die. And when youre in close proximity to your partner all your star cards recharge at a much faster rate. Its literally a dream to play with someone.So find players to game with. If you dont have any friends that play on your console then find friends on this sub. I have tons of players that I play with whom I met through our discussions on here. If you want to add me I play on Xbox as well my username is my GT. Side note. Even if youre flying solo the game should automatically assign you a partner randomly from your teammates in every game mode you play. So spawn in on them and try to stay with them to get faster recharge rates ,StarWarsBattlefront,d7xj4cm,2,t5_2u9wz

9142264,0,t3_55ijyg,Slot bodyguard so you dont get one shotted by it you should have shield slotted anyway for extraction and depending on your side some flashbangs and or dioxis and smoke.Dioxis stops corner camping. Smoke stops chokepoint camping. Flashbangs can be tossed around corners this is where bodyguard helps to blind the enemy team so you can run out and kill them. You can also run out while shielded  roll as you exit cover because there is more than likely someone waiting for you with a scatter gun  and draw fire so your team mates then rush and get it sorted out.Of course if your team is not very good at actually playing as a team then rage away.

9593798,0,t3_5bivou,So after a few players were asking us we decided to host a HvV tournament on the game. It was to be run sort of at the same time as one of Cargo tournaments as the modes are significantly different. We wound up getting  teams that singed up I thought there would be more.    Now I am not sure on too much about the mode because I barely play it and I never played it in an organized match before day  of the tournament. But in the matches my team played and the one match I streamed the ideal strategy seemed to be for the Heroes to not approach and wait for the Villains to come in. I am not sure but there is some ability on either Han or Lando that seemed to cause an absurd amount of stun lock and knock back from far range and it made the heroes side seem really strong. We did have a ruleset where teams took turns playing both sides to counteract any faction advantage though so that was fine. However I am not sure how popular the mode can be if the meta is to just camp it out though.     It is possible that my team was just bad I did hear from  teams that Villains were stronger but I am not sure of the reasoning. The ruleset that was decided upon might have also significantly affected how things played out too only heroes no spawning back in dlc heroes allowed  maps both sides played higher round score wins.,StarWarsBattlefront,d9vmrjn,1,t5_2u9wz

9765331,0,t1_dagrqwb,I really hope Battlefront  is more like Battlefield . Doesnt have to be an exact replica set in Star Wars just more akin to it. Large game modes and maps open sandbox game modes and not simply linear ones a greater scale of destruction  these things have been said over and over again you get the point.In some ways I feel like Battlefield  is nearly everything Battlefront should have been and then some. I enjoy both games in their own way dont get me wrong but I think theres room for improvement and I do think Battlefront  can look to the Battlefield franchise for some ideas. After all its the same developers developing both!,StarWarsBattlefront,dagslia,3,t5_2u9wz
9767436,0,t3_5f2vs4,I want the Nucanon Renegade Squadron. I think having a OT focused campaign is fine and having clone wars for Online and Skirmishes would also be fine by me. But...I genuinely think well see a fall of the Empire to the rise of the First Order focused campaign. Set shortly before the Battle of Endor or starting with it and moving on to little skirmishes between the defacto New Republic and the Imperial Remnant. Maybe little strikes the FO makes against the Republic and finally the full fledged war between the FO and Resistance. ,StarWarsBattlefront,dah1xea,1,t5_2u9wz

Plus even if you have another really fast and ready Bacta you still have to take time away to use it in the middle of a potential engagement less time shooting. Id rather have Bodyguard on Level  so not only do you have your bonus from Bacta and Adrenaline Stim activated you also get a  damage reduction.

10064402,0,t3_5js0n6,I really didnt like the way War Stories worked for Battlefield  but i dont entirely mind the idea as a general concept for Battlefront .  ie. A collection of little minicampaigns following different groupscharactersforces.But id want it to be a lot more fleshed out more numerous or extensive better written and better brought together as cohesive parts of a whole overarching storyline.  And most importantly completely different in the way they handle gameplay.  Less one soldiersquad vs the world silliness.  And especially way less hey run ahead and deal with all the stuff by yourself...well wait here crap.  Didnt like the way War Stories played at all...found them mostly tedious and chorelike interspersed with snippets of bad dialogue...and too shallow to really connect with what was going on in any way.So in the sense of being played from a variety of different perspectives different roles different characters...absolutely i think that could be a great way to handle the campaign for Battlefront .

10083602,0,t1_dblnxwk,Yeah... positive reviews. Not sure why. The movie is a blatant copy of ANH. The plot is almost verbatim the same.As for Rey being a badass Luke did far more badass things than she did in ANH including blowing up the Death Star and single handedly saving the entire rebellion and he is still considered a complete rookie in ANH but nevermind that right? Same for her being the chosen one  we have no idea what they plan for her character and all we got are fan theories. Since they copied the plot of ANH I am inclined to assume she is female Luke. Orphan getting caught up in the galactic plot on some backwater desert planet... sounds familiar?gtKylo Ren is the best villain since Vader.Considering that the competition is the prequels doesnt say much. Hes an interesting villain but certainly not a formidable one. Basically a very troubled thoroughly manipulated kid with little skill but a giant ego. The emotional battle is done very well but were talking about whether its a character one could be enthusiastic about playing as.Im not. The new movie was ok but it wasnt great. The characters the same ironically Kylo and Finn being the most original ones which is why I mentioned Im hoping they will NOT continue to mimic the old trilogy as far as the plot goes and do something more original in the next movie. You never can outdo the original by merely copying it.,StarWarsBattlefront,dblwuvy,1,t5_2u9wz

10290921,0,t3_5nd29e,It took me about  games to grind out  wins. It was kind of fun when people arent doing glitches and there isnt a master player in the game. If they are glitching quit immediately and find another lobby.Use Palpy on Imperial base endor and Imperial Hangar sullust. Stay in the halls and use Chain Lightning. Heal. Repeat. Second choice is Dengar. Lure the Rebels to a hallway and Hurricane or bomb their ass. On the Endor crash site I used Dengar to go  near all the log tunnels. I have seen others successfully camp in the top of the treehouse with Palpy or on the ship with Boba.Rebels I find Luke is pretty good on the Rebel Hanger Hoth indoor and Base Hoth outdoor and Rebel Depot Tatoine. Never stop moving in the halls. Force push and force dash up and down. Second choice is Chewy.The open maps are very difficult unless youre very good. I mean the Rebel map with the Jabbas ship on Tatoine the Sullust outdoor map with the Imperial ship in the middle and the Jakku badlands map. There is little cover so using mobile fast characters works best.Try and be the first one to spawn into the game. They get the Hero selection first and that is a huge advantage.Learn to Listen for the Hero Health token sound locate them and pick them up.Try odd hours to find lobbys with scrubsnoobs.If youre in a lobby with multiple dominant players and cant get up the leaderboard after a couple rounds leave. Find another lobby.Carry the most devious deadly devices in your hand to get points against the Hero so you can be the Hero multiple times. Jump pack. Bezerker. Explosive shot. Disruption. Scatter gun. Even secondary fire. Everything goes in this mode.Look for pick ups. Orbital strikes can take out a hero. Disruptor rifle and Smart Rocket do tons of damage. The r and viper droids can get you lots of damage points. Be smart with them.,StarWarsBattlefront,dcaj5h7,2,t5_2u9wz

10645154,0,t1_dddwip5,Then you introduce a balancing ratio and make AI kills worth less.  In this game the combo would not work well... I agree.  But the idea is to improve it to the point where it does work.  Thats the goal.  We really dont have a huge variety of equipment either.  That is blowing what we have and what we have access to at any given moment out of proportion.  The spawn system is pretty much shit too.  Having a patched Battlefield squad spawn system with a minimap and RT spawn context to prevent spawn kills and spawning in contested zones would be ideal.,StarWarsBattlefront,dddys56,3,t5_2u9wz

10888645,0,t3_5vkpns,Theyve used it before the earliest mention I could dig up with a quick search was January  However I wouldnt read too much into it as devs and others involved with the game have been calling it the Battlefront sequel or the next Battlefront for instance on the forums the discussion section of the sequel is called The Next Star Wars Battlefront. Battlefront at this pointis just shorthand for the sequel. It could very much be called Battlefront  but Id wait until the games official reveal until dubbing that as its actual name. The EA Star Wars account also has a list of stock answers and this just happens to be one of them. Their replies arent always the best source for information.,StarWarsBattlefront,de3346c,8,t5_2u9wz
10896714,0,t1_de3rjus,Because it is warranted.Dont get me wrong its cool to see that another developer at DICE keeps an eye on the subreddit for feedback and help improving the game. But saying this doesnt really affirm that there will be major improvements or updates.

10902126,0,t1_de4g68t,Remember the Rebel Announcer We did it we are through. Once you are on the ground we need to distract the Imperials so our teams can advance to their objective.Team  were the troops on the UWing transport that made it through the Shield Gate in Phase  and attacked the objective in Phase .Team  were Jyn Ersos troops that were already on the ground and were part of Phase . Remember the events of Rogue One once Mon Mothma and other Rebel teams figured out what Rogue One was doing they scrambled the Rebel fleet to attack Scarif. You can see the fleet in the background when you spawn in as the Rebels.So DICE is contradicting their objective set out to the players or it has been glitched. Because I remember when I downloaded Scarif at launch and until the recent patch that you spawned inside the bunker. Also interesting to note is that a particular Rebel theme plays that should be playing half way through Phase .Once again another patch and more problems added to the game.,StarWarsBattlefront,de4h6b9,2,t5_2u9wz

10947717,0,t1_de8xibb,A few tips for you Youll be starting from scratch going into a mature player base so youll need to spend some time grinding to earn credits and score for unlocks. You have the option to use your partners hand in multiplayer though which helps. You can download the companion app for iOS or Android. You can view your stats and progress get notifications of your friends playing and play base command which is a minigame that you can play to earn score and credits. Your hand can include a trait e.g. Sharpshooter  more damage when ADS Escape Artist  faster movement. Your trait levels up as you play increasing in effect based on how effective you are. It used to be based entirely on kills but now it is more about score especially objective score. You drop a level every time you die. Getting your trait up can really help you out e.g. Sharpshooter    damage when ADS. Several of the most popular items e.g. Bacta Bomb Relby V are locked behind Hutt Contracts. As well as spending the credits to unlock them you also need to complete some challenges e.g. Get  Kills as Han Solo. These only start counting after you unlock the contract so spend the credits on them as soon as you can afford to.Thats all Ive got for now. Enjoy the game.,StarWarsBattlefront,de96h2h,4,t5_2u9wz

11150716,0,t3_5z7kh5,I go back and forth on this. I get the appeal of the point youre making in terms of the value it would bring to gameplay but sometimes I think that when it comes to the Star Wars franchise specifically an overemphasis on specialization runs counter to how a lot of people connect with the universe. What I mean is that I rather like Stormtroopers being kinda well samey. Theyre Stormtroopers. I know that people who dive deep into the lore will tell me about all the different classes of trooper but as someone who watches the movies exclusively I balk at the thought of the next game becoming too gamer focused. I think this game  though not without its problems  really is immediately accessible to a wide swathe of fans and I think thats a good thing. I personally would rather have a chaotic battlefront full of both noobs and pros running around than a game that tries to compete with more competitive modern shooters on a mechanical level. I really do believe that one thing that makes Star Wars special is that it truly is for everyone. I would hate to scare off thousands of people for the benefit of the more diehard in the community. That doesnt mean I want nothing to change rather I want change that doesnt forget the broader Star Wars audience. Not that I have a problem with these games but I dont want overwatch or TF for Star Wars.,StarWarsBattlefront,devx6tk,7,t5_2u9wz

Throw away that Jump packbacta bomb and play with the AE for immersion. I recommend you try this on Scarif or at least thats my favourite DLC try and see what environment is your favourite. While you may not always go on huge killstreaks you can still get your trait to lv but more importantly I have found that I have so much more fun when I dont care about my stats and just enjoy playing in huge Star Wars battles.

11376233,0,t3_62as2e,Leia is pretty straightforward.  Your best results are probably going to come by not leading the charge.  Shes a support character and theres really nothing wrong with using her that way.  You want to have a lot of friendly troopers around while using her to lock down objectivesstrategic points picking off enemies at range.With HvV Leia is super valuable.  Deploying the shield in a good location and doling out those health tokens wins games.  Still want to generally keep enemies at some range.Jyn...i have no idea.  I havent figured that out.  She seems tailored in some respects to up close frontlines action.  But isnt nearly tanky enough to withstand that sort of thing for long.  Im inclined to say shes not just very good...but perhaps im missing something.,StarWarsBattlefront,dflh5su,1,t5_2u9wz

11531304,0,t1_dg2uc3o,Well I suppose your mileage may vary but as I recall it was really slim at launch. No real singleplayer except tutorials six heroes very similar weapons barely any customisation and some pretty uninspired multiplayer options bar Walker Assault which is the meat of the game. I can forgive them going in an arcadey more casual direction   though Id prefer something a bit more substantial  but it really did feel undercooked to myself and a lot of people which is why being charged the same again for some DLC felt a bit insulting.,StarWarsBattlefront,dg32q59,3,t5_2u9wz

11572243,0,t3_654d19,Absolutely. Right now theres only one real setup that is super effective  bacta bomb personal shield jump pack then either berserkerbodyguard. I can get up to  kills without heroes or vehicles on WASupremacy with that setup. Its much much harder to do that if you drop most of those cards. Restricting certain abilities to certain classes actually gives you more options because it makes every playstyle more effectivebalanced. At the very least heres what they could do  restrict cards to having a utility slot jump pack bacta bomb medical droid etc a grenadeweapon slot and then your charged card slot. Hell jump pack should probably just be a charged card anyways. ,StarWarsBattlefront,dg7px6d,0,t5_2u9wz

11578755,0,t1_dg8e94j,You clearly dont understand the difference between Conquest and Galactic Conquest. What Dennis is saying in his tweet is that DICE is most likely not going to add a Conquest mode like in Battlefield  to any of their Star Wars Battlefront games. What everyone is asking for is a Galactic Conquest remake. Which is a way to play a series of matches all linked together offline. If they were to put out a new version it wouldnt need to include the Conquest mode  they could easily do it with Supremacy. Sort of like how Skirmish was a new name for Instant Action. Skirmish is offline WA with bots whereas Instant Action was offline Conquest with bots.,StarWarsBattlefront,dg8gibp,4,t5_2u9wz

It hasnt started to bother me yet but it will if it goes on forever.  At some point it doesnt serve the story or make sense for every lead to be one gender.Edit  Feminist here I believe in equality of genders and that means equal representation.

11751833,0,t1_dgry2gp,Well they dont. Clone blasters fired bolts that were slightly more ionized than most blasters due to how the gas is formed into plasma but at the end of the day theyre still very much regular blaster bolts not ion shots.,StarWarsBattlefront,dgs3log,8,t5_2u9wz

11783228,0,t3_683vyq,When theres a decent pilot the behemoths in Battlefield  can be really fun. But there are also people that dont know or dont care about helping their team thats when the behemoths get frustrating.I wouldnt be opposed to a hybrid rails system. For instance maybe they could have  or  paths that the walkers can take. You get to choose the path but the walker is still on rails. I realize this system would work best with nonlinear maps like BF conquest maps not the current Battlefront walker assault maps. ,StarWarsBattlefront,dgvo0zd,2,t5_2u9wz

11788169,0,t3_6864nj,Definitely. Theyre adding weapons from the series to the game the Blurrg  is Heras blaster and is a preorder item. So if weapons are added dont see why characters wont be. All the other SW games are adding them. Galaxy of Heroes Force Arena Force Collection... Yes theyre mobile apps but still. The players wont know who they are excuse is total bantha poodoo. And technically its Lucasfilms call if they get added. If they want them to add TcW and Rebels characters DICE will have to.,StarWarsBattlefront,dgw88dd,8,t5_2u9wz

11797582,0,t3_68alwq,I with there were a snowtrooper equivalent to your standard trooper customization. I hate seeing the nonHoth troopers on Hoth. Like why would they not all be in snowtrooper armor? For example on Kashyyyk if the standard clone looks like what we saw in Episode III thatd be cool. Or it could be a standard clone in Camo. If you want another armor set thats fine like if you want an airborne gunner or a BARC helmet... but why not still be in a Camo skin? Lets have some visual consistency.,StarWarsBattlefront,dgxaoc0,1,t5_2u9wz
