7207453,0,t3_4d38r6,Ive been doing a lot of research on a new mattress myself recently and ended up buying a  natural latex mattress from a local boutique in my hometown.  There is a plethora of information out there on sites like mattress underground sleep like the dead old bed guy etc. that can help you figure out the best mattress for yourself.The IKEA mattress discussed is not a true  natural mattress.  It says  natural and  synthetic on IKEAs website.  A  natural latex mattress is going to be more expensive.  I think the main difference is that a  natural latex is extremely durable and should last much longer than the synthetic.  You can find  naturals like Sleep EZ in an almost comparable price range to the IKEA mattress.   ,Mattress,d1xfhzo,1,t5_2rnrs

7529770,0,t3_4iepdh,If I were to do this it sounds like your going to need a king because of the size. I think its possible with any of the foams your mentioned. Havent done it before but I dont think you would lose anything by cutting it. First step I would take the cover off you might be able to salvage it better if you do it from the start. I would use a reciprocating saw to cut. Good luck!,Mattress,d2y3jod,1,t5_2rnrs
7765540,0,t3_4ll693,Definitely go to some stores and check out some options in person. A coil bed with a topper would really give you the best bang for your buck. A cheaper firm innerspring with the topper of your choosing is a good route. If you get an all foam in that price range youll be shopping in a year again. Generally the first thing to play out on a cheap bed is the foam. So if you find something firmer itll have less layers of cheap foam to break down on you. By putting your own topper on it you can change that out any time.,Mattress,d3ovpxl,2,t5_2rnrs

8366051,0,t1_d5n9z8h,Its quite rational actually. I dont hate Sealy and Simmons but Im not afraid to call them out for their crap. They use just crappy enough foam to get by so the bed will last just long enough so they hope people wont try and warranty it. Ive never said its a scam it is a bad value in most cases. They use cheap foam and charge good quality prices because they have a huge marketing machine to keep their name relevant. People will blindly buy a name brand because they perceive value behind the name. In the case of mattresses that allows them to cut corners and get away with it to make a buck and if all the majors do it theyll shorten the buying cycle and sell more beds. Beds lasting over  years isnt good for business. As for the Firm they are just like any huge corporate machineits all about the numbers. Push more out at any cost and move on to the next mark. Ive worked in Corp Retail sales and know the game. They carry their HR line up to a certain price point so they can maintain higher than average margins on cheap beds with no chance of comparison shopping. I know youll say the HR beds are a great value because youve been programmed that way but I can only guess theyre actually a worse value to the consumer otherwise they would just carry an S brand for that price range. Cheaper foam higher margins and still a bed that only lasts a couple years. I could stand to be wrong with the HR beds but I have a feeling the foam densities would be terrible if it ever came out. Im sure Matt Firm talks how they live their employees and blah blah but if you have a couple bad months in sales in sure that attitude changes quickly. Any locally owned furniture or mattress store can and does compete with mattress firm any day. Typically a locally owned store will actually appreciate the business and it will keep that money local instead of stuffing Matt Firms pockets. This is really less about them and more about encouraging people to shop local and support good local businesses. Now I believe you think you take care of people and you probably do a good job but you also drink a lot of their coolade. There are a lot of good choices in the world of mattresses that do not involve Serta Simmons Sealy or tempurpedic. A mattress is a combination of foam and springs that mattress is only as good as the foam and Springs.,Mattress,d5nb38x,1,t5_2rnrs
8436722,0,t1_d5w1fc5,Ah most likely the spring systems you were on were cheaply manufactured bonnell systems. They are all interlinked and they feel firm and bouncy. They arent great for long term on the cheap end. If youre happy on a twin by all means thats great it saves you cash. Id say spend about  on a twin with pocketed coils and youll be set for much longer than  years! P,Mattress,d5w4okd,0,t5_2rnrs

I do have to comment on how they make beds the oldfashioned way. Thats simply not true the video shows her stitching a tackandjump part of the quilt. That fabric comes prequilted to foam in  of its applications. I even carry an independent manufacturer with that cover on multiple beds. The fact that its tapeedged that piping you see around the corneredges is a goodsign though. It does help keep the cover from shifting too much however the craftsmanship is basic in this situation.

10636334,0,t3_5s5q04,The obvious thing is to take a deep fitted sheet or mattress pad with strong elastic all around and put it over the topper and the mattress. You can also use some of those clip on elastic bands that fasten across the corners of the fitted sheet to pull it tight.If you mean you already did that and it was not enough then put a tightfitting cover on the topper if there is not already one. If you are lucky you can find a topper cover that has elastic bands already sewn onto each of the corners. If you cannot find one like that then get some wide and heavy elastic from the store and sew some on yourself. Or you can use the long elasticband clip sheet suspenders attached to the topper cover to hold it in place.Also if your mattress topper cover does not already have a rubbery bottom you can get a piece or two of nonslip grip material that is also used to keep rugs from sliding and put it between the topper and the mattress.,Mattress,ddd21ez,1,t5_2rnrs

10951540,0,t3_5wclpb,First step would be to see if they will do anything warranty wise with the bed. Beyond that from what I know of the materials they use I guess I cant say its surprising. I dont say that to make you feel bad about your purchase because they are marketed to be amazing. This is partially just reality setting in. Anyone can build a bed that feels great for a year but then materials will show their wear. In reality youre probably looking at a new bed. Hopefully Leesa will help you out with it. A box spring will not help your situation the foam has likely began to break down and is losing support. This is what many caution against when it comes to materials mattering and with many bed in a box companies. Please let us know what Leesa says if you try to warranty it. ,Mattress,de9kntt,1,t5_2rnrs
