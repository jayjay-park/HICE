4036803,0,t3_36rj49,I decided to start a Legacy Challenge while our net connection at home was down. This chapter documents Apollonia Musagetes the founder career as a scientist her attempts at contacting alien life and her explorations when she finally did. Its a very modern family.The family name is inspired by the muses of greek mythology because I wanted them to have a family trait which is Creative. I will give them the trait all sims born into the family still thinking about if I would give them to adopted kids at Young Adulthood if not already picked for them by the trait generator. Succession Law goes as suchGender Law EqualityBloodline Law ModernHeir Law DemocracySpecies Law Tolerant  I was thinking of strict equality coz I might be bored of playing a gender twice. I decided to make heir law a democracy since Im posting it here.   Formerly MeritTheres still a couple of days off until Apollos birthday and week until Cassies so please vote for which one you want the next heir to be by sounding off in the comments.
