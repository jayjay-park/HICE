4944690,0,t3_3imcis,Runes The runes suggest communication. They did not indicate if a relationship would come out of this communication or not. But it looks like talking to him about how you feel should be the next step in this potential relationship. Stones In the stones I see two rocky paths separated by a river. This could mean that this relationship may be hard at the beginning if it takes off at all. However there is potential for a bridge here if it is desired by both people involved. ,BoneandStone,cuhtghg,3,t5_39ixz
5450535,0,t3_3pokjy,The casting reveals  Stones the casting shows your abilities are one in the same with your outcome that all negativity is dropped and dispelled. The spirits are high and the focus remains sure. However there will be slight opposition in the way of discomfort of some but this is not your worry. I see nothing of great discouragement on the horizon in this and your destiny remains secure. Hope this helps and good luck on your journey,BoneandStone,cw8cwos,3,t5_39ixz

6566884,0,t3_45ja5r,GUEST READER!   I just did a simple three card spread on this but I can do a more detailed reading if you like.The eight of cups came up first. The eight of cups illustrates the quest for bigger and brighter things. It illustrates the pilgrim in search of the promised land. It lets you know that its time to find new vistas of your own.The World is next It signifies the successful completion of a chapter and points the way towards bright new beginnings. It signals the beginning of a new chapter or a whole new life.Next we have the Queen of Pentacles. When you see this queen your investments of time and money in a project are sure to pay off even if there are some bumps in the road youre savy enough to navigate any obstacles in your path.As I was shuffling for this reading the Empress decided to jump out at me and I believe she is a clairifier to this situation. She serves as a reminder that we are in control of our own destiny. If you see a disparity between the life you crave and your current surroundings its time to grab the bull by the horns and take control of your own happiness.All in all I feel like you already know what you need to do. Your fear of the unknown is the only thing holding you back. There may be a few bumps in the road but  I believe that moving can only bring good things for you and it will give you the opportunity of a fresh start without so much spiritual and emotional baggage.I hope this helps ,BoneandStone,czykje2,2,t5_39ixz

7848518,0,t3_4lxyo9,Spirit reading Hi there I sense that orientation will be straight forward no issues it looks like itll be practical and go smoothly.  I sense youll be feeling a bit anxious but itll actually be pretty boring.  As for transferring yes I do sense you will want to and you will.As for your love life I sense you will meet someone in about five or six months who excites and intrigues you.  He will also be really interested in you.  I see you guys talking a lot and being really into each other at first just on an intellectual level.  You will have a good deal in common.  It will become semiseriousit would be more serious but both of you have a busy schedule that makes it hard to see each other as often as youd both like.  It will be a mostly lighthearted enjoyable relationship.  He is pretty inexperienced too so you guys are on a similar level.  He will have light brown hair hazel or green eyes a shy gentle smile hell be quite a bit taller than you and hes relatively thin.  You will definitely meet him in school and the relationship will last a year and a half to two years.  I hope this helps some let me know if you have any questions! ,BoneandStone,d3y8rby,2,t5_39ixz
7948146,0,t1_d49buph,Thank you! Im having a bit of a rough birthday so I appreciate the good wishes.Your reading was so relevant its eerie.Early spring I started a religious class that just ended. Im a bit anxious about it being over but it was such a blessing in the first place. Ive found a spiritual home for me after years of looking and I look forward to joining this community. At the same time Im having a bit of a spiritual fallow period due to some depression and anxiety so I feel a bit anxious that Im not doing much. Kinda silly but its hard to unravel that knot sometimes.As for settling down this is good news but not unexpected. Still its good to hear. Ive been with my boyfriend for four years now and weve been living together nearly a year. We are at the point where weve decided to get married just waiting for a better time financially. I love him very much and got extremely lucky that he loves me in return. Hes a wonderful guy I could just gush about all day but I wont. Anyways Im happy to know that things are exactly as they appear. Always a fear to me as I lived too long with rosecolored glasses but we communicate very very well and I trust him with everything I have.And October Im just trying to get through this summer to fall. It feels like fall will come together more. And I always feel better in the fall anyways. Also October was the month my daughter was born! We have a lot of birthdays then too. October is just a good month. Looks like I have a lot to loom forward in this one.Thank you so much! This has really resonated with me and given me hope. I just have to make it to fall. I can make it.Thank you again for your time and effort. Its meant a lot to me. Good birthday present.,BoneandStone,d49g2x9,2,t5_39ixz

8794010,0,t1_d74joif,Hi there I sense there is really no reason not to pack it up and move on.  You have waited long enough and nothing is going to change at least not for the better.  I sense you are strong and courageousyou often take on more than your fair share because you are able to and because you feel its the right thing to do.  Its okay to set yourself free when a situation is no longer beneficial for you it doesnt make you weak or anything negative.  In fact it means that you have healthy selfesteem and boundaries.  I hope this helps some let me know if you have any more questions ,BoneandStone,d74x5z5,3,t5_39ixz
