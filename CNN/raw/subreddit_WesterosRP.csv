Youre well spoken and courteous are born of two ancient houses and from what my lord husband tells me you didnt fight all to poorly on Lord Gregors nameday. You seem as capable as any man in this camp. Moreso in fact.

4478452,0,t1_csv5tm4,If the gods are good Daryn remarked.The Lord of Parchments was pale with dark circles under his eyes. Like as not he hadnt slept since the passing of his wife.Daryn had slept. The flagons of Dornish red had seen to that. Nothing else seemed to blur the vision of Mychels limp body in Ser Arstans arms.Lord Karyl Selmy had not allowed them to take any Selmy men with them and Penrose was loathe to take any swords away from his childrens side. Tytos Dalt had demanded he come along to shield Daryns back but Storm ordered him to stay. He was lady Ynys cousin and had the gift of making her laugh. If anyone could break her from her catatonia it was him.Do you know Lord Tytos personally? he asked Penrose.,WesterosRP,csv6eiq,4,t5_38dyj
4491139,0,t1_cswrd2s,The Clansmen are savage dogs Lord Corbray they dont use scouts check their surrounds nothing of the sort. I recalled what Id read on them a week prior We will allow them to begin their assault on Hearts Home let them bang on your walls and die with arrows through their hearts then in the midst of battle I will have my Knights crush their flanks from the surrounding forests. I was sure this plan would work and my confidence was showing in my tone.,WesterosRP,cswros4,1,t5_38dyj
4517467,0,t1_ct01z0o,Very good. Tytos replied. He turned to Damon. Stay here with the men I must needs talk to Garret alone. Tytos moved away from his men following the path that the guard at the gate pointed him towards. As he walked he spied an apple tree in the distance with a pool at its feet. There sat a man who had a drawn face. He looked tired despite only ruling the Reach for such a short time.Tytos moved towards him. Lord Garret. I am pleased to finally meet you.,WesterosRP,ct02joz,1,t5_38dyj

Come out and fight you fucking cowards! Tormund yelled. We should storm the walls! someone shouted more voices from the crowd shouted agreement. Theres too many inside they can man every inch of the wall we cant take it Tormund thought. Well starve em out! Tormund yelled over all the voices. Theres too many men inside the castle theyll be starving in a week. Tormund hated the thought of a siege and so did his men but it was the only way they could win.,WesterosRP,ct09o9j,1,t5_38dyj
4519097,0,t1_ct09o9j,The clansmen were setting up a siege a fucking siege. These dogs who were meant to be mindless savages were doing a siege of all things.  Mlord Lord Corbray is back One of my men said Get him the fuck up here I responded viciously due to the shock of impending doom. I moved over to the side of the main bulk of clansmen and there he was the fucker who called himself a King.  Clansmen doing a siege!

4693673,0,t1_ctlqaz4,Helaena looked at the book she had picked out. I dont even know.. She sighed it didnt seem all that interesting anyways. Perhaps I will give it a read... Not much has been interesting me as of late.. maybe it will spark up some inspiration. She shrugged then smiled at the Maester. ,WesterosRP,ctm6fy9,1,t5_38dyj
4711122,0,t1_ctnn4jf,I dont hate the idea. Aemon was in truth nervous. He never rode a dragon that wasnt Silverix. Dragons only had one master. Aegon the Conqueror only rode Balerion. Danaerys only rode Drogon. It was something that simply wasnt attempted.But he looked into the sky and whistled for Silverix.,WesterosRP,ctodj0s,2,t5_38dyj

4993320,0,t1_cunt0uv,For the first time since leaving that humble abode in Riverrun Cyrenna found herself praying. First to the Seven then to the Old Gods then to whoever the fuck else was leaving. She prayed that she and Rodrik would be spared from being scorched alive from that demon in the clouds. Then she compromised prayed that Rodrik at least make it alive and maybe name a daughter in her stead and sometimes think of Cyrenna whenever he fucked whoever he marry. She was not a weeping woman and Rodrik had never seen her cry but tears formed up in her eyes. Thankfully they dried as the ship turned around and she could tear her vision away from the beast of Valyria. The captain was dead crumpled onto the deck of the ship and Rodrik was holding a bloody knife. Even a simpleton could know what was going on. She knew that there would be repercussions from both slitting the captains throat and from abandoning this battle. But anything would be better than being turned into a pile of ash at the bottom of the sea. Returning to Rodriks side she mumbled into his ear I think perhaps this is a sign that maybe it is time for us to return back home.Home they both knew without saying was not the manse back in Tyrosh. It was North. ,WesterosRP,cunvqlf,7,t5_38dyj

I do not doubt your ability however we must not leave any stone unturned. Steffon sighed as the room quietened.I wont let these servants of mine die without receiving justice. Theyre under my protection I cant let this happen again. An enormous wave of guilt rushed over Steffon his face softened from being intense to a frown of sadness. I dont care who did this I do care that they pay for their crime.,WesterosRP,cvvoui0,3,t5_38dyj
5377247,0,t1_cvyzsam,I do not trust the Targaryens thats  true. But I do not trust most men from Westeros either. The Targaryens are mad cruel and stupid brother but they have power. Even if Lord Tytos has secured all these marriages there will be lords who refuse to fight against the crown. Asher examined the Lord of Storms End.My lord grandfather used to say the Targaryens were the laughing stocks of Westeros but he understood why some men feared them. The dragons are whats keeping the Targaryens in power. No one loves the Targaryens but no one has the power to stop the dragons.

5485859,0,t1_cwcv2v4,Daryn had ridden into battle against hosts many times the size of his own. He killed two Connington knights at the Battle of Harvest Hall one of whom was near a giant. Hed led the left flank of the Selmy Forces to victory at Blackhaven when he was still just a squire.In spite of all that Daryn found himself trembling. Hed never thought to meet anyone of greater station than his Baratheon liege lords.

The Princess paused and looked about the place for something to think about but Leo Tyrell provided something. Oh yes my mother likes to make things ... over the top.. This isnt one of her best works though. You should have seen Aemons five and tenth name day.. Helaena remembered that one name day everything was over the top and honestly she didnt think this wedding compared to that one day.I thought she would do more for this wedding. The Princess shrugged. I guess even she gets tired of it.. ,WesterosRP,cwfdo53,3,t5_38dyj
