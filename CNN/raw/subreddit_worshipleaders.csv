4052134,0,t3_36ofd6,My good friend just released an album with my favorite version of Come Thou Fount ever.  Not a new song but new arrangement  hallelujah refrain.  The worship album is full of other great tracks as well.  Definitely a good place to find new songs. Come Thou Fount  Link to album in iTunesMy school also just released a worship album full of original songs.  The best ones in my opinion are Wholly Yours Crown You King I Want More Love of God and Mountains Fall.  Seriously great songs.  Link to iTunes,worshipleaders,cri6ax7,2,t5_2wnsh

6017892,0,t3_3lj0zw,Is the main issue specifically stage volume? I battled with sound guys over stage volume with loud tube amps for years until I discovered the Palmer PGA. Changed my life. Sound guys love it. No stage volume or mics required. Absorbs the load from your amp emulates the tone of a guitar cab and outputs a nice full EQ line level signal that you plug directly into the desk.Ive since switched over to a kemper profiler which is even simpler better sounding cheaper easier to set up more consistent and more reliable than my old amp head  palmer setup. All of this coming from a former  boutique tube amp head snob type of guy ,worshipleaders,cy8gzeu,1,t5_2wnsh
6151921,0,t3_3zql84,It sounds like you guys dont have a practice time. That would be the best solution. Practice together and figure out how to start end end each song during practice. Maybe some songs will have an intro from the pianist or organist and youll come in during the verse or chorus. Or maybe they can play a one or two measure lick then you all come in together. Or you could count everyone in like a drummer hitting his sticks together. There are a lot of options here you just need to find which one works best for you and for each song. Youll also want to ask for a set list. Even if you cant get a practice time together get a set list. No band member should have to be in the dark about which songs are coming up. And get it a couple days before service if possible so you can familiarize yourself with the set. If there is no possible way to get a practice time going youre just gonna have to talk with the rest of your band and figure out a way to solve this issue. You could use one or two of the techniques that I mentioned in my second paragraph. Maybe ask them to put a short description of which method they want to use on the set list. Its all about communication. The problem wont fix itself. Just speak up. No one is going to get mad at you for trying to do a better job and make the worship service better. ,worshipleaders,cyowr4s,1,t5_2wnsh
7896091,0,t1_d43kqbn,Do you have a female singer on your team?  Both of you should be comfortable singing the melody for each song without jumping octaves.  If she feels that she has to screech to hit the higher notes lower the key of the song.  If feel like your are growling instead of singing raise the key.,worshipleaders,d43le3q,1,t5_2wnsh

9388249,0,t1_d95tnvm,Yeah I have had that issue when Im on guitar where I feel like something is just missing musically and unfortunately I can let it take me from entering into worship. Sometimes we focus to much on what we are trying to perform instead of letting God control it. However way to be a trooper and get through that set list twice with a sore throat.,worshipleaders,d960za6,1,t5_2wnsh

SetlistOpener One Thing Remains  Jesus CultureSecond Fierce Jesus CultureThirdFurious  BethelFourth Death Was Arrested  North Point Worship Response How Deep the Fathers Love  Austin StoneWhat went well?   This whole Sunday was focused on the Love of God so I really feel like the song selection reflected this. Death Was Arrested is such a powerful song and always goes over well. Fierce is just hard to not like.What could have gone better? The track for How Deep The Fathers love doesnt give counted in queues so in  time this gets a bit tricky for coming in. Fortunately we didnt have too many issues and had it all ironed out by our third service. Furious went okay... I think our congregation wasnt ready for such a driving song but we are working our way there. About a year ago they were doing nothing but hymns and Chris Tomlin KLove songs.Everything said and done though... it went well! Jesus needs to be the center of our worship and all we do. As Worship Leaders we lead people to this fact. Edit Formating.,worshipleaders,d96c6zt,1,t5_2wnsh
