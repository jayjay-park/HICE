5529100,0,t3_3ism21,Im gonna take a different approach to the final... Ive seen a lot of good theories but I cant help but think that everyone is reaching for the obvious answers. Heres what I think...  We know that season  is going to start off with everyone in prison weve seen the set designs I think that  is not the betrayer but the savior. Maybe it was him attacking people and turned them in but perhaps he did it to protect them all from someone or something weve missed. I think that S E or  well see  help break everybody out of prison. Perhaps he allowed himself and the others to get caught in order to get closer to the General maybe not physically but information wise closer to finding him and this was the only way. Knowing nobody would have agreed to this he set them up and turned them in maybe cutting a deal for himself. But he needs everyone to help him in his quest to kill the general so he has to break them out come clean and at the same time perhaps force them to help him. Just a few thoughts Ill admit its not a fully realized concept or storyline just a collection of ideas. I mean  is a main character and theyre not going to kill him off or demote him to a reoccurring character only appearing when it suits to advance his story. No he has to come back and he has to be a part of the crew this being the case then there has to be a good reason for his actions and an equally good out for their current situation. Thoughts?  ,DarkMatter,cwie3en,2,t5_2tbuh

Just finished the last ep of season one with the final shot revealing that it was in fact Six who went around and comatosed people. Then I read the synopsis of that episode on IMDB which said that the person responsible for the tossup on the ship was the person responsible for the memory wipe  was this revealed in the show?

Given  whos doing the writing this shouldnt be a surprise nor is it a bad thing. Though it does feel a little bottle episodey im sure there will be little tidbits here that we can return to and say ohhh look! theres the pen!. Its tough to follow up from last weeks awesome episode. It kinda felt odd that the Arax betrayal plot went completely silent. I guess well see that comeback later. Maybe next episode?Also they didnt really resolve Devon Nyx and Arax stuck in that room i cant imagine this entire debacle has helped build trust between the crews. ,DarkMatter,d5fgc2b,2,t5_2tbuh

My wife and a friend worked in the prison system here in different capacities granted not superduper galaxy max prison but your in for life prison Also without the threat of if you escape you are in a vacuum They dont really stop those conversations or ones about bringing in contraband or committing crimes in the prison. Ive heard stories from both of them about the crazy things people would tell them directly about how they were going to get out or what they were going to bring in.I suppose if its that super of a prison on the show they should have just put them in stasis pods...

8749650,0,t1_d6zbcwf,This comment reminds me of bosses who argue that employees should work for the sake of the opportunity or their own inherent passion for a role agreeing to any pay offered and never asking for a raise all the while being super excited about it.Acting is a job like any other. Thats doubly true for such experimental series as Dark Matter that are started on a small budget like the TV equivalent of a startup.And it wasnt just his effort or lack thereof. It was the overall lower production quality of Season  that resulted in Rook being a less intricate character which as I pointed out is to be expected. So I dont think its fair at all to use blackandwhite reasoning about goodbad acting as if thats all that matters especially in a scifi series.,DarkMatter,d6zd1bk,14,t5_2tbuh
8820176,0,t1_d780rvl,I do agree it isnt about their greatest fear but their strongest depowering feelings  which might be a fear might have already come true and became a regret. Still I have to disagree with your points.Twos most depowering feeling is exactly her strongest fear that she may never escape Rooks clutches and fall ultimately victim to him powerless to defend herself.Threes is the exception his already came into fruition and that is the knowledge the regret the powerlessness he feels for not being able to save his loved one and the knowledge they will never be together again in this life hence the whole shot yourself and be with me angle.Fours greatest regret is also his greatest fear. Misaki isnt Fours greatest fear but she is the perfect vessel to give it shape and form. His greatest fear is an abstract one. He fears the decay and fall of his people more than anything and in particular if he can prevent it but doesnt. No one presented so far can convey it more clearly than his old friend Misaki specially with his current memory situation.,DarkMatter,d782bz4,15,t5_2tbuh
