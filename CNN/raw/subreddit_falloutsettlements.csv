I assumed that having  food was preventing me from reaching . So I assigned a Mr. Handy from Graygarden because I thought it would be badass to have one hanging around to the supply line and assigned him to harvest food when he arrived. I got him to stay there effectively bypassing the inability to use the disabled move settler command although he rarely moved and never made any noises. He produced  food from my adhesive growing plant set  but my happiness started plummeting and is now at  and falling.

It doesnt buy you a lot of height but you can drop one smaller floor tile on top of another. You cant do a third though for no good reason.

The ladder is highlighted in red as the floorboards pass through the foundation block. Pre . patch that would never have happened as I have already mentioned all floors including foundation blocks used to be able to clip through each other so the highlight would have been green.One other small issue the trick you do with the mutfruit is not a rug trick it is a group selectmultiselection trick. You can swap practically anything instead of the rug to do the same thing.The true rug glitch can only be done with either a rug or any floorboard and as you know it has completely different properties to the group select trick. The problem with not making this distinction is it has caused a hell of lot of confusion with people. I see complaints from people practically every day where they are incorrectly trying to use group select with a rug and a junk fence and wondering why they wont clip into each other and other similar examples,falloutsettlements,d0xbzw8,2,t5_3aqii

And again having six or more shops in twenty or so settlements means that even if they generate only a modest amount individually it adds up rapidly. And besides having general stores and weapon stores everywhere is great for junk and having a bar in every settlement with a bunch of benches around it provides a place for your settlers to gather and socialize after work each day which is a convenient place to check on them all at one place and one time for employment equipment etc. Honestly Ive got nothing but nice things to say about having the full compliment of stores in every town. ,falloutsettlements,d1aecm0,2,t5_3aqii

Lay down foundations or full floors not the quarter ones in that pattern. You can use a stairway to make a nd story if youd like but thatll make it more challenging not less because....

This is a build mode specific trick that gives you better control for manipulating movable vehicles. Place down a large carpet with a couple of turrets at the front.

Elianoras Crafting Fury  GTX for example or the shop tables and shelves by xnjguy. Or go all out save everything and use OCDecorator. Other mods use resources making them easier to deal with while OCdecorator requires the exact item.Anything that adds signs posters etc. to enhance your stores. Immersive Vendors makes the default booths spawn decorations when the shopkeep is attached. Signs of the Times or Better Stores or Business Settlements.And finally my cream of the crop Northland Diggers which adds in a bunch of harvestable crafting stations for people to work at. Specific things that find specific things like a garage finding oil a butcher for finding meat and leather with a version that adds to food! or hazardous waste station for nuclear material.

11525061,0,t1_dg2cu9w,Thanks Donald. Too many people to list and make to thank for inspiration but your easily within the list!Done for awhile now. Have no motivation for the game or building anymore. Having said that I do have  last big build left in me but if I do it it will be over a long period of time.I dont get chance to frequent here much now and the interest to look at every build  because I always have looked and then spoken to nearly every poster trying to help them is no longer there. Ive helped as much as I can now..hoepfully others will take on the baton for me.,falloutsettlements,dg2d8vy,14,t5_3aqii

11621101,0,t1_dg7ki2g,Seconded. I love seeing cinder blocks cars buses wire fencing crates and other stuff stuffed into bits of the wall. It really breaks everything up and keeps things from looking samey.,falloutsettlements,dgd9gss,1,t5_3aqii

11658291,0,t1_dghgl5p,Well there are different stages of upgrades on each kind of building which you unlock through varied goals. There are also a power requirement on almost all the buildings except for the food fields. Plus this mod doesnt stop you from building or adding your own stuff to what the settlers have built so you can have a mix of both.I understand that it may not fit into the category of I built it all by myself but i was so impressed with the mod and how it varies the different buildings and shops that i felt it belonged on this subreddit. I truly understand if others dont this is just my opinion.,falloutsettlements,dghhcw7,6,t5_3aqii

11675840,0,t3_66k902,I made a bunch of robots and put them on trade routes between settlements. I had  trade routes from Sanctuary to near by settlements like gray garden and they cleansed the upper north west of the map. Plus you can catch a few of them fighting raiders together.,falloutsettlements,dgjh17g,3,t5_3aqii
