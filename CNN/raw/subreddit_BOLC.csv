Youre coming from OCS so there isnt an issue from going from reserves ROTC to active or any of that mess.MAR is your report date? and FEB is the day youre leaving OCS?

We are TDY enroute which leads me to believe that you should be eligible for BAH while you are TDY. I imagine there will be some BOLC students who have houses and families back home that will be eligible for BAH but I am unmarried and have no children. It wont be a big deal to pay that last months rent it just would be nice to have that sweet sweet BAH money. When do you report? ,BOLC,d44wq9d,1,t5_311ko
