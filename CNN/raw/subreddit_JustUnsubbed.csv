2254093,0,t1_clqav5h,I found these comments in less than a minute of lookingId rather see jadon smith in this movie than  lead women. Sad.So basically Ghostbusters  is going to be a Lifetime Original Movie.Unless the hilarious women are going to be Rosanne Tina Fey Lisa Lampinelli and the resurrected corpse of Joan Rivers theres no a way an allfemale cast could come close to being as funny as the original four.Who do you call? Not Ghostbusters today because they are all on their period.Dont they know women are not funny?Strong female cast LOLThe fight ghosts... But when they see a spider FUCK THIS SHIT!Lmfao all female cast? What are they gonna do nag the ghosts to death?Because I predict it is going to be a sissified estrogen fest of feelings and witty girly one liners followed up at some point with girly girly sorority sister arguing followed by i love you! i love you too! hug and other damnable tearjerking moments that get me every time.. its going to be a super cliche chick flick and way off base from any of the existing ghostbusters lore. One can wonder how much cleavage will be showing or how short their shorts will be. I can dig a female cast member or two joining the gbusters but a full cast of girls is going to ruin the whole thing. I am all cool with empowering women but I see this as a wrecking ball to one of the greatest franchises of all time. Im sure the feminists are all for it. Sorry I wont be seeing this one in theatres if they make it an all female cast. Maybe Ill see it for free. They should make the lead character Oscar from gb Dana Barretts son played by Bradley cooper who we find out is really the son of venkman who retired after egon died mysteriously. And dies shortly before Oscar learns this truth. Thus causing him to take the reigns and recruiting a new crew to save the world.

I think if you want to meet more furs that you can relate to you should take a look at the FurNet IRC network. Theres well over  channels chatrooms dedicated to many different niches within the furry community. yes that does include fetishes not gonna deny the sexual element in the fandom. If not that then theres actually quite a lot of FA groups that you can join but theyre a little harder to find because for the most part theyre literally just user pages claiming to be groups. Nonetheless I have made friends through them before so they do work!Really the important part is to find groups of furs who share your own specific interests and go from there.

5088898,0,t1_cuzah01,Hey Im not trying to be defensive Im just going to explain why I like this sub  I have had times where Ive been part of a community for months or years and really enjoyed it. Ive met great people I have friends IRL and on Facebook who I met on Reddit and had a place to share my common interests. Then something bad happens and the community turns toxic. People start being congratulated and upvoted for saying melodramatic things like fuck you youre a fucking moron if you think that without explaining further. Agendas suddenly come in to play. Discussion ends because all people want to do is repost meme sentences. Often when you try and get a thread or sub back on track you get downvoted to hell by people either reposting more memes or telling you to fuck off. Sometimes you just really want a place to vent and reminisce because a place that you used to enjoy and spent years helping to build is gone. rshitpost and rsummerreddit are different because they pretty much shove bad content in your face like hey look how crap the subs I choose to subscribe to are. rjustunsubbed appealed to me because its about discussion and people actively doing something about it by quitting. Theres some very interesting informative threads here like the Native American one several documenting mod abuse etc. Comments here usually tell an OP if theyre wrong and missed the point of the sub. Ive discovered a lot of Reddit history and trends that I wouldnt have known otherwise. We know that by nature this will be a whiny sub anyway since it literally revolves around venting but Ive found a lot of interesting side effects such as quality alternate subs and mini history lessons. If anyone has any ideas on things that they think can improve this sub then they are more than welcome to send them through  ,JustUnsubbed,cuzekrt,8,t5_34bcl

When I quit tinder early last year I wiped my bio clean deleted the photos made my profile private deleted and uninstalled the app because I was anal about security. My Facebook and all my photos including profile photos are on total lock down. The cunts at Tinder later reactivated my account without telling me grabbed my Facebook photos and made it all publicly available. Thank God I dont list my employment on Facebook otherwise they would have done that too. I didnt find out until  months later when my boyfriends coworker sent him screenshots and asked why I was trying to tinder using a photo of me and him since that photo was my Facebook profile at the time.
