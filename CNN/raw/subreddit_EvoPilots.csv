4810287,0,t1_cu0nkda,Just got off work. Im gonna be playing a good bit tonight and I would want to get the opinions of errbody else.To be honest Im not sure I could stomach being VS again on Genudine. Though I would save a bunch of money. Its really a hard decision. I think to keep things fresh for me I would want to play TRSome questions though will I have my cosmetic upgrades to my Sunderer on TR despite buying them with BC on my VS on another server? I bought all the Galaxy upgrades with BC will those be there on my TR? I dont see why they wouldnt since theyre the same as VS.TLDR upredatorcouple put up the Egyptian signal I appeared out of no where and was like Damnit Gordon,EvoPilots,cu0vk86,1,t5_38y9o
