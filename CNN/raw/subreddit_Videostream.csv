2305702,0,t3_2lj82z,The new design is cool and all BUT i thought there were gonna be  auto subtitle loading if the subtitle file has the same name as the video directory selection for the playlist instead of just file selectionJust a bug or not gonna happen ?!,Videostream,clwp9d2,1,t5_31btj

6345652,0,t3_42er0z,Yup. I literally downgraded from Windows  to . just because videostream didnt work right. Now it just needs mkv support and the ability to use my phone to set up queues and Ill be out of ideas for how it could be improved upon. Hell my  year old father bought it and a chromecast as soon as he saw how well it works when my parents visited last year. ,Videostream,czaxi8u,2,t5_31btj
6345772,0,t1_czaxi8u,Its been working great on Win  for me for months. other than the occasional once or twice a week issue where it refuses to send the video to tv.  reboot ing all  I. e. chrokecast router ans pc fixed that ,Videostream,czaxzyg,1,t5_31btj
7788657,0,t3_4lvub8,I know its not super practical but i use Chrome remote desktop or teamviewer on my phone to connect to my computer and then edit the playlist. Its the only way for now but i hope they see this tread and upgrade the App because ive been waiting for this upgrade for a long time. ,Videostream,d3ri2mh,1,t5_31btj
8324296,0,t3_4tkx40,If its mounted as a drive itll work! Your router needs to be good enough to handle the video going nas to router to computer to router to chromecast! ,Videostream,d5i3bp5,1,t5_31btj
