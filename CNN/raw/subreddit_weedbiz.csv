I might have to shift my dream job focus from ProviderStore Front to providing ancillary services with significantly less red tape.  Topic for a different thread Id LOVE to see the Business Plans for Cannibus Catering  Green Parties  Green Tours  Green GetTogethers etc... But I think those only exist in CO where its legal entirely so far.  ,weedbiz,ci44t72,1,t5_2ydms
1297206,0,t3_28woh7,My understanding of the Florida MMJ bill is that only Nurseries that have been in operation in for Florida for  consecutive years can apply to grow marijuana.  And then it is limited to only one strain Charlottes Web.Florida will also be limited to only  nurseries approved for growing and have a list of only  that meet the requirements,weedbiz,cifjwg8,3,t5_2ydms

2620845,0,t3_2pwekh,I have no idea about the legality behind getting a work visa for a  dispensary but to get a job at one the the best way is to start your own cultivation even if its one plant just keep a grow journal and notes about your plants from seedling to harvest this shows your future employer that you know how to trim how to grow how to cultivate marijuana,weedbiz,cn0oks0,2,t5_2ydms

6234496,0,t3_40yirx,If I read the regs right NY has a union component required as part of the legislation thats union labor for the grows and stores. You might reach out to the labor union people they are well aware of the laws and getting ready to be a part of the industry. The medical market there will follow the pattern of the other states but there will be significant differences because of the structure of the laws. This includes only allowing extracted oils clearly that hardware and equipment will be in demand as well as the skills to run the machines. Expect a tightly knit market in NY in the next  years most of that time will be spent in establishing the market structure and position for companies real estate will see a bump in the areas where the large cultivation facilities will be appearing. They are large I know cause I designed systems for some of the applicants in that state. The construction contractors and trades that can be ready to fill the required services will enjoy a premium income in a more limited market if their workers can get the badges and certs etc oh and the unions will be around again... I think thats mostly a good thing but we may see some issues. I would expect to see an increase in the types of medication allowed and the preparations and the usual efforts from those wanting to change that legislation. Its a different game in politics when the money starts to flow... There will also surely be some spillover smuggling like in states that used to go to NY for their alcohol but in reverse...,weedbiz,cyyalv0,3,t5_2ydms

9515900,0,t1_d9ldvpe,I mean... again like I said it really depends on the level you want in on.   If youre looking to grow they want to see that you have some experience managing large scale gardens. Likewise if youre looking to work in their extraction they need to know you have experience and can handle the instruments in the most efficient way possible. Of course this means nothing for the more clerical or administrative side of things...  If you have a great handle on cannabis know the ins and outs the regulations of your state which should be available via health.ny.gov somewhere then Id say apply! Youll never know until you try!!  I can also tell you this everyone involved in the NY and CT mmp wears more than one hat. Sometimes its nice to share that hat with someone else burnout is a real thing.,weedbiz,d9m1cza,1,t5_2ydms

A great deal of this is just finding humble personalities that will work well with other staff as well as the basic customer service aspect of dealing will all kinds of people cranky rude misogynists liars require special handling but also samples.  Our budtenders receive educational samples from the growers and are able to get better than normal discounts on things theyve never had before so they can build knowledge.  Even if you havent had one thing in particular another staff member has and we all share details observations.  It also seems like none of us ever lie about trying something or how good something was its not necessary.,weedbiz,daqwy2a,9,t5_2ydms

Im  live in the south and very determined to have a future in the cannabis industry. Im in the process of going to college right now and at first I was going to get a degree in horticulture but after giving it some more thought I had the same idea that I would be better off with a business degree and just studying growing on my own. My question to you is what type of business degree I should go with.
