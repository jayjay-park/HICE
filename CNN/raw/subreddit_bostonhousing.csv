912608,0,t1_ch7tpjb,br apartment in allston right on green line. Rent is mo for the available room its not super large. Utilities include electric and cableinternet heat and hot water are free. Youd need first and last to move in no fee or deposit required which is nice. Me and the other guy are mid twenties gainfully employed graduated from NU together a few years ago.There are pets in the apt I got two little kitties who are quite friendly although one could lose some weight. Im social and active Im an avid cyclist the other guy is a bit more homey but we enjoy quite a bit of xbox and ps on the weekday evenings. The apartment is sort of old we keep it clean but its a far from flawless unit. We do also have a washerdryer for ourselves in the kitchen which is clutch and we do have a balcony back deck type of thing. Let me know if youd like pictures or any more info.Good luck with the apartment search either way man!,bostonhousing,ch80pke,3,t5_2s9gf

3914648,0,t1_cr2c0lp,One of the roommates is deathly allergic to cats but he says hes also planning on moving out in the summer as to when I have no idea because he keeps flipflopping on the date which has been starting in June to late July. I could let you know when he decides to move out since we ARE allowed to have cats just not dogs. Plus his room would be bigger than mine but I think rent is  a month. ,bostonhousing,cr2i71v,1,t5_2s9gf

6684205,0,t1_d09zo3r,Yes although if its provable discrimination you can hang his butt high in court.  Families with children are a protected class.  Your EDIT scenario is much more likely than simply asking you to leave.  However its additionally on the landlord to provide you with comparable housing while the lead issue is being addressed at their expense.  So youre looking for a  bed?,bostonhousing,d0apejm,1,t5_2s9gf

7824449,0,t1_d3vfmw4,Hey! Generally speaking I would like to live with someone closer to my own age just because I think my lifestyle might clash with someone older and more settled. Best of luck though! You might struggle with two kitties by the way. If I were you I would tell the landlord you have one cat and hope they dont notice about the second.,bostonhousing,d3vj9gd,1,t5_2s9gf
8509932,0,t1_d656ofd,Thats what I thought since we never got the receipt for the deposit. The only thing though is the previous agreement was tenant at will on a month to month basis does it still mean triple back?,bostonhousing,d65api6,1,t5_2s9gf
8524744,0,t3_4whe64,I live in the town next to Westwood. Youre best off looking further from Boston than closer. Such as Norwood Walpole foxboro etc. anywhere closer to Boston is going to be much more expensive! And if you head closer toward Worcester it will be cheaper. Worcester is the second biggest city in MA but I wouldnt recommend living there. Worcester is about  to an hour from Westwood. ,bostonhousing,d675lru,1,t5_2s9gf
