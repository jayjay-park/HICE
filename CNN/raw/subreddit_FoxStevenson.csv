1442841,0,t1_cix2n7c,If he applied his new Fox Stevenson style of music to this track it could be an absolute dancefloor banger. I absolutely love the melodies on this track and the lyrics are amazing too. ufoxstevenson pls update us if you have any plans for this track or your older songs! I think itd be pretty amazing if he could release an album of a bunch of his older songs but I remember Fox saying that hed need to have huge hype from his fanbase and a lot of support from his record to have a go at an album Im just saying from memory that isnt word for word what he said. ,FoxStevenson,cix4wzz,1,t5_2xq73
