441686,0,t3_1z2oms,I really dont see Newcastle keeping a clean sheet with the form Hull have been in. That being said West Ham have a tough match. Personally Id put Reid in but its quite a close call. Id stick with Henderson yet having four Liverpool attackers could be costly in a low scoring game yet what are the chances of that?! Sturridge has been so consistent its hard to give the armband to someone else but Hazard would be the one to take it this week. I think its more of  a safe bet against big potential thing. I guess with matchday two and you having both Adebayor and Bony it could be worth a gamble on Hazard.Really nice team though mate any thoughts going forward into next gameweek with four liverpool players and three tottenham players who have a tough game against chelsea? ,UltimateFPL,cfqjnc1,2,t5_30egc

758852,0,t3_22umwg,As part of my loan to get in Aguero for the next  weeks Ive also got to get in a .m priced Striker. Steven Naismith amp Sam Gallagher are my main targets. Im backing Gallagher to slot in for J.Rod but Naismith has more pedigree and a DGW. ,UltimateFPL,cgqjdqp,1,t5_30egc
1500175,0,t3_2bdp2m,Good effort. I was just looking at your spreadsheet. Mignolet and De Gea are easily the best pairing. The weeks that both play on Sat are GW GW GW GW. Howard is the best option as youve noted but Foster is a reasonable cheaper option playing Burnley and Newcastle at home on Sunday in weeks GW and GW.,UltimateFPL,cj4bk5n,2,t5_30egc
