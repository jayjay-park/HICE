6435174,0,t3_43os3w,Hello Ive done this event a couple of times and really enjoyed it! Google Three Peaks by Rail that is the organisation I did it with! Its run by the Railway Children Charity so your team would need to raise money but in return they transport you to all the mountains via a cool train they feed you and you see some great scenery on the way.  The team who organises it are really friendly drop them a Email and make sure you tell them your not working in the rail industry as that might be a requirement. ,UKhiking,czkxo76,1,t5_2wfnj

Merthyr Tydfl is slightly closer to the main Pen Y Fan area than Aber although therell be loads of nicer smaller towns and villages around.Yeah theres tonnes of paths especially up to Pen Y Fan. I cant recall seeing many signposts. Definitely plan a route and bring an OS map! I would be impressed if you managed to get into trouble in the Brecon Beacons to be honest! Even from the most remote areas wou could probably walk km in any direction and come to a roadvillage and theres barely any sections steep enough to cause concern.,UKhiking,dfjxkd2,2,t5_2wfnj
