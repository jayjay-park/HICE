5772405,0,t3_3u2jt6,Done the survey there. Im confused why youve made the connection between slimming world and gluten free however? I understand that there is a certain subset of people who believe gluten free is somehow healthier but ive never heard any mention of gluten free at any meetings or slimming world blogs facebook pages forums etc.,SlimmingWorld,cxcmci1,1,t5_2u1i2
7752508,0,t1_d3ndrey,I dont have a slow cooker and I dont have freezer space apart from one tiny drawer because I share a house with a smallish kitchen. Theres no where for these things. Ive had to keep more veg than Id like non refrigerated for the same reason.Yeah I weighed the shreddies out ive eaten shreddies most days for  years? and it was rediculous. I then added a g portion so if I want to eat shreddies Ive used both health extras and . syns automatically. I can switch to weetabix but because I dont chew it I dont feel like Ive eaten as much? Its looking at this stuff thats made me realise how many psychological issues I definitely have about food.,SlimmingWorld,d3nehuw,1,t5_2u1i2

11020369,0,t1_deh2rln,I ate Ketogenically for AGES and lost of ton but I couldnt sustain it. So doing SW really blows my mind a little because of all the low fat things and the unlimited rice and pasta. Obviously youre going to lose weight faster if you dont eat too much starch but you can still have it as and when youd like.As far as syns are concerned they are there for a reason. If you want to use them all for a mars bar a day and it doesnt affect your weight loss go right ahead! Its what theyre there for. The weeks Ive lost the most Ive prioritised speed over everything but Ive still eaten my fair share of chocolate. ,SlimmingWorld,deh4mo7,4,t5_2u1i2
11020979,0,t3_5xcri6,I usually use all my syns on sauces chocolate and sweets every week! Some weeks Ill reduce the sweets and stuff and go out for a meal but usually Id rather use them at home on evening treats! Ive lost st .lb in  weeks.,SlimmingWorld,deh74i2,2,t5_2u1i2
11056077,0,t3_5xtpqw,Itll be ok. Put it behind you and get back on plan. I had a day like this a couple of weeks ago. I pretty much ate all the chocolate I could lay my hands on and spent about  syns in one day. O I got straight back on it had a couple of SP days saved up some syns and did some extra exercise. I managed to get a loss at the scales.Look at this blip as being beaten by a bad guy in a video game. Youve lost a life but you can start the level again and learn to avoid or defeat the bad guy this time by learning from where you went wrong. Dont feel embarrassed or ashamed. Losing weight is hard and we all have blips from time to time. Whats important is that you own it dont beat yourself up and keep going. ,SlimmingWorld,del6rth,2,t5_2u1i2

11627083,0,t1_dgdxokb,Oh right! Not sure what Yoghurt you use but there are many synfree yoghurts that dont use your a choice! Of course I dont know what your consultant has told you but Ive never heard of a yoghurt being an a choice!,SlimmingWorld,dgdxxfc,2,t5_2u1i2
