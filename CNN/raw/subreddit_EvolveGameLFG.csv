3081374,0,t3_2vgekd,If youve watched the devs play you might know what Im talking about. They seem to take a much more relaxed pace when hunting the monster. It seems counterintuitive but I dont think you have to chase and cutoff the monster the whole game. Just divide the map in two by posting up in the middle and contain it to one side perhaps? Let it come to you more so since it needs food and you dont. Maybe focus on gaining a perk early on. These are things I want to try and coordinate if anyones interested.,EvolveGameLFG,cohdrzb,1,t5_35y3j
