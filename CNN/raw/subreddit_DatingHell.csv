8088766,0,t3_4gpxo4,Oh lordy I do believe this really happened. Of course he might not have called again because hes thinking Oh man I thought Id be able to get home and change before the date. Great I am way overdressed and now she probably thinks Im a snobby pretentious asshole and will never want a second date. I suck. Goes home and cries in his lonely room. Or at least I like to think that might have been why he never called again you know? I mean he did book a date with you so lets give you some credit here okay? This falls within that category of no one shows up to see your perfect house until the pipes break the dog pukes all over the rug a skunk lets loose under the house and kitchen cabinets fall down. Then EVERY single member of your family and friendsespecially the house critical oneshappen to be on your doorstep at that very moment. ,DatingHell,d4p9250,1,t5_2w4jn
