2312276,0,t3_2lokil, I will offer the following perspectives as I have connections to both schools Roger Williams has a beautiful campus in Bristol RI. My brother graduated from there about  years ago where he was very active on the sailing team. His involvement there lead to great things including his current job as a professional sailor. Im sure a lot can change in  years but many of his friends who also attended RWU Including his wife are extremely nice people. They seem to have a good variety of majors particularly if you have any interest in marine sciences.  My girlfriend is a current student at Endicott and Ive visited the campus on many occasions over the past year. I find the location to be quite nice being proximal to both the ocean and the city of Boston easily accessible by commuter rail. The biggest turnoff in my opinion about Endicott is the students Ive witnessed while visiting there. Now Im sure this doesnt represent everyone who goes there but I honestly got this impression very quickly and it has upheld on return visits. The boys and I wont refer to them as men because they dont act like men here are some of the most immature I have encountered. There seems to be a huge sense of entitlement at this school which propigates by guys walking around being loud obnoxious and thinking they pretty much own the place. From what I can tell they also are pretty interested in hooking up with whoever they please without the manners of a gentleman. Yeah there are nice guys there too but the overarching theme seems to be these manchidren think backwards baseball cap BIG EGO and douchey attitude really dominating here. Yes people at this school seem to be well off financially but its not going to be quaint like your average upperend New England liberal arts institution.  This may be an unfair characterization as Im usually only out at night when the creepers are vying for a party Yes most kids just walk around looking for a party so the academic atmosphere may be different.  To me it sounds like there are people that are serious about their major here who work hard and have really good placement in jobsinternships as a result but at the same time theres lots of kids who apparently are here for  years of babysitting after high school.  Im definitely not trying to be mean and attack the school and I know my girlfriend loves many aspects of it. Just offering my views to be taken with a grain or two of salt! ,NavyBlazer,clxigtr,1,t5_32edi

2565797,0,t1_cmth4p7,Honestly I dont fully buy it. When youre dealing with off the rack suits from fashion brands even topquality ones like Purple Label youre spending money on the brand name markup that could have been put into bespoke tailoring which really does produce a betterperforming suit instead of an egopolish. In my opinion the only suit thats worth venturing outside the  range  because there really arent materials and OTR craftsmanship worth more than that  would be a bespoke suit from an experienced tailor. And thats not what hes buying. Of course I believe in the principle that dressing well is important and the image you project matters but clothes that call attention to themselves are in bad taste. When men talk about how many compliments they get on an outfit I cringe a little bit because I know that when people compliment a mans clothing theyre really saying Wow! Look at you wearing that extremely inyourface commentbegging item! The best dressers in my book get relatively little overt attention for their wardrobe because they dress in an understated manner that draws only unconscious positive attention. Im into a suit that an acquaintance wont remember the next day but will help them remember you as an upstanding confident guy theyd like to have a beer with. ,NavyBlazer,cmthl3d,7,t5_32edi

First up is my white suede LWB with a brick red sole Seersucker suit and shoes Gingham suit braces and shoes Raw silk jacket w linen pants and shoesNext is a pair of offwhite suede shortwing bals with a leather sole that gets more use in the winter. Tweedy top and shoesFinally heres my dirty bucs with a leather sole. I wore the same shoes this sunday with creme gabardine trousers blue OCBD and a pastel striped bluegreen herringbone woollinensilk summer tweed but neglected to get a good picture. Top and shoesTheyre not represented here but I have a third pair of white suede shoes PTB from JAB with a brickred sole that I treat as beaters for that wonderfully wornstainedpatinad look. Probably end up with a decent amount of blue and red staining too from my reds and jeans crocking.Lastly Ive got several other colors of suede shoes as well  midbrown suede tassels navy suede pennies light brown waxed suede boat shoes pastel blue suede weejuns olive suede chukkasPlus two pairs in dark brown I dont have pictures of JM Aristocraft SW bals and Rancourt moctoe crepe soled chukkas. Out of everything I get the most use from the alden tassels. I wear those suckers all four seasons with everything from suits navy flannel olive poplin ect to fun pants critter cords and madras to plain ole khaki shorts and pants.In your situation Id say it really depends on the rest of your wardrobe. Dirty bucs are the most flexible and easiest option. I find they go great with most madras reds jeans nonmatching chinos ect and work great on through the fall but not so much winter. White bucks on the other hand go fantastic with seersucker pincord and other bluewhite patterns reds again bud dont hold up quite as well with earthier khakis and greens unless theyve turned that cremeeggshell white most do with age. I dont think they work very well in fall but they make an excellent alternative to black shoes for a starker winter outfit. Theyre definitely the more fun choice too.In short Id say go for the dirty bucs if you dont have any other mid to light brown casual to businesscasual shoes white if you do and wont feel selfconscious in them. Lastly if youre around a size . you should get in touch because Ive got a pair of each that are getting culled from my shoe rack AE tan suede pennies with a red dainite sole and oldschool Americanmade dexter white suede saddles ,NavyBlazer,cs8ki0l,3,t5_32edi

So if you do everything correctly thats almost k in Southern Tide apparel per year which admittedly doesnt go as far as you might think but still a really good deal considering you probably wont spend more than  hours total on the brand rep stuff.The only tricky thing about the whole job is gathering email addresses. If people at your school know aboutlove southern tide this wont be hard at all.  At my school however the brand is largely unknown...so it was actually DIFFICULT in some cases to give away the free stuff. I did my events at the oncampus bar which was a plus because...beer but it also draws kind of a random crowd. If I did a tailgate event instead it could have been easier to give stuff away but harder to control. All these little startups that probably consist of two  year old kids in their parents basement or sadder some recent graduate with no skills and a desperation to become the next KJP that need brand reps at  universities across the country...now thats just pointless.,NavyBlazer,csq3g70,2,t5_32edi

These things were meant to be worn though! The highest compliment you can give any craftsman is using and enjoying the product. At the same time the fray or small patch that speaks to a life of adventure adds character to the piece. Thats how I got around that feeling. I realized I had some great pieces that I was NEVER wearing which was a shame. ,NavyBlazer,ctsaxu7,3,t5_32edi

Also some of you seem to wear them daily in America I dont think Ive seen anyone wear them that casually over here.Sorry nobody has gotten to your penny loafer question.  Generally in the U.S. youll find that penny loafers are a step below dress shoes.  So youll see them paired with a tie khakis and a blazer. But they also work more informally as well worn sockless with shorts  or casually with khakis and a sweater.

I didnt put forth the effort I should have as a high school student but I ended up attending a very highly ranked school. My advice is keep doing all that really impressive extra curricular stuff but keep a balance. Lean on those activities in your essays start thinking now of a time when you experienced overwhelming adversity. Obviously do what you can to get high SATACT scores thats what really got me into schools. Most importantly for your situation is setup an OFFICIAL VISIT AND INTERVIEW. If you can sit in front of an admissions officer and present yourself as intelligent mature and wellbalanced young man it will benefit you tremendously. Your biggest asset is how involved you are and explaining to them how you do it independently from your parents. Prove that you are going to provide a similar impact on the Elon campus and you are mature enough to do it sans parents. Also if they ask about your grades be honest. They have heard every excuse in the books. And hopefully you can point to some improvement over the years to show you are trending up. ,NavyBlazer,cvow5t8,1,t5_32edi

If youre totally sure its not right then just say that. Tell her you had fun if you did of course but you dont see it working out right now. The hardest line to walk is being firm a surprising number of people give in if the other person is really upset but this only makes things harder in the end but kind.

5701651,0,t1_cx3rzxf,Packer makes a move in the latter article that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. He claims first that safe space or microaggression talk can be used to silence others. By the end of the article he claims that these terms inevitably lead to intolerance or censorship. This shift is rather silly and completely unargued and makes his argument go from something I was nodding my head with to angrily typing out this comment. Recognition of implicit bias is not equivalent to censorship. He also claims that the authority these terms possess is unmerited but that seems to be stemming from his own ignorance of the literature and is completely unargued. If the author made arguments and not observations I might be more charitable but he comes off as trying to be unbiased while not questioning his own presuppositions. ,NavyBlazer,cx3ufny,3,t5_32edi

Even if it doesnt fit for  you can cut the buttons off of it and attach them to your tailored blazer and it will look  times better. This is a quick fix.    . Keep an eye out while youre thrifting for a blazer that fits.  The one you have will certainly do for now so there is no rush but keep checking the blazers when you thrift and one day youll find one that fits perfectly for .
