8204502,0,t3_4rl0cg,Im with you.  weeks. Between the stomach compression and the acid reflux food and I are on weird terms. I made myself eat some protein yesterday for dinner after eating small bowls of rice up until then. I didnt eat much but ate a little more from leftovers for lunch today.Im honestly okay with it as long as I dont start getting tired. I know my vitamins have a good chunk of the extras that little man and I need Ive got padding that can be stolen for calories and Im drinking water like an elephant.If I do start getting unusually tired Ill start focusing on getting some good healthy fats in me like avocados. It helps that Im moving back home in  weeks and fresh organic veggies and fruits are super easy accessible and cheap there.,August2016Bumpers,d5348ca,2,t5_3bay8

10901218,0,t1_de3d2gh,hi! so question about giving baby boiled carrots i tried it because i want to do the baby led weaning thing and my little one gagged on his first bite and threw up  how does it work? how do i know he wont choke on a piece of carrot or be throwing up all the time?,August2016Bumpers,de4dt0a,2,t5_3bay8
11288334,0,t3_612gky,We do purees every morning and evening unless he is super tired or we are running late. But he doesnt eat that much  even the ones he clearly likes. We tried a piece of a banana and he liked it but had no idea how to use his gums to eat it. Cuteness thing! But yeah we make an effort but he isnt a fan,August2016Bumpers,dfbilnw,2,t5_3bay8
