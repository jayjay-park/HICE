4516651,0,t1_csyp24b,Everyone who joins this subreddit identifies themselves as a Cord Killer. As Tom repeats almost every episode. Watch What You WantWhen You WantWhere Ever On What Ever Device You Want.That doesnt mean you have to cut cable. In fact some people simply hate having to think or choose what they want to watch when they have time available. Cord Cutting isnt all about saving money. In fact in the long run you may end up paying more depending on your relationship status.As a single person living alone. Cord Cutting works for me as I am saving money. And I feel more in control of the content I consume.Im the  minority who built there own DVR using Mythbuntu and my old game pc. It still works fine with O.T.A. content using HDHomerun network tuners. But I ended up getting content overload with Cable as I had  tuners. And I would schedule and record on all  tuners at times. The problem would be I would never have the time to watch all that recorded content. I came to the conclusion when I filled all available SATA ports and had over  hours of content I was Ehoarding.As Tom explained. What you pay for cable does not entitle to record and store all that available content that comes with that subscription.When you pay for cable your paying to be first in line. When that recorded content you payed to see is  months to over a year old. One must askWhy am I paying to be first when Ill never have the time to watch it before its available for streaming?.,CordKillers,cszyuwv,1,t5_2zhhs
5964121,0,t3_3x4epj,gtWhat Netflix does have is a tremendous amount of data on what people have already liked to watch. Do they like adventure drama? Make Marco Polo. Drug sagas like Breaking Bad? Give them Narcos. Thats probably excellent business but it doesnt encourage great leaps into the unknown.Ive always thought while Netflixs shows are very competently made its choice of shows was uninspiring. Its not going to take a chance on a show like HBOs The Leftovers or HBOs Enlightenment although its on the right track wMaster of None and Sense. Have to give credit to Amazon for selecting Transparent  Mozart in the Jungle and Man in the High Castle.,CordKillers,cy1fdy2,1,t5_2zhhs

7675221,0,t3_4kf9xw,TLDR Men rate womenoriented shows eg Sex and the City lower than women do.  BoingBoing attributes this to a sexist movement in which misogynists maliciously try to tank ratings for womens TV.BoingBoing appears to believe that this is a more plausible explanation than the idea that maybe those shows just dont appeal to men.
