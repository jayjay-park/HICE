Like any personal conflict well never know exactly what happened or who was in the wrong if anyone just the very narrow view we get from public statements that have been made about it.

MSTK helped build that network in a major way and it deserved better treatment than they gave it.

10453262,0,t1_dcsw9b1,Dweezil who for years has been the frontman of a band going around and paying tribute to Franks music often with members of the Mothers of Invention included in the band is fighting publicly with Ahmet who currently runs the Zappa Family Trust.  Dweezils issues are mostly that the trust is lopsided in favor of Ahmet and they are not exactly into sharing the revenue from his band with him despite the fact that only one member of the family can still actually play guitar.The Trust and Ahmet have claimed Dweezil is lying.  They are in financial troubles due to Franks now late widow Gale having poorly managed everything.  So they need financial help and while rereleasing material from the vault of Frank Zappas music he recorded a ton helps it doesnt go all the way.  Lawsuits are involved.  We have little beyond the contention of the two sides to go on.I really dont know whos right or wrong but I do know that A Dweezil is pretty damn good at playing his fathers music and B pretty much anyone who has tried to help a Zappa lately has found themselves dragged into this.,MST3K,dcsz9tc,4,t5_2qltq

The sets were not shot straight on but at an angle sometimes pointed towards a corner or a side wall. The actors moved through this space and got up in the camera while gags andor other characters moved in the background.

Thankfully as the youngest brother in a big family with lots of older cousins I was exposed to weird humor far before it was age appropriat. Plus my Baby Boomer dad was a protogeek aficionado of middle th century scifi B movies which he always borrowed from the library for me to watch. It made me the damaged derelict I am today. Thanks Pops. I wish you couldve seen Shin Godzilla. Just a short while later it would be on the SciFi channel which was carried on our cable and I showed my grade school friends.

11598684,0,t3_65ja4b,Some more recent material would be nice but theyd have to choose carefully IMO.

Its hard to riff stuff like this well because its almost riffing itself already. The latest release of a new Sharknado is even a hypedup TV event now with increasingly silly cameos and improbable action sequences.A good MSTK film has to be bad but like organically bad.

11641618,0,t3_65vz3b,Been a fan of Jonah for years from the Nerdist podcast.  Ive watched  episodes now and I think hes doing a great job.  My only complaint with the show is its a little dialogue heavy but thats on the writers.  Its hard to hear the movie dialogue with them talking over it so much.  Im hoping it improves as the episodes continue.  Luckily Netflix subtitles the movies too so I dont really miss as much as I otherwise would.,MST3K,dgfla9f,1,t5_2qltq
11645322,0,t3_6666yc,I wonder if this would mean he wouldnt return for a possible th season. How odd would that be? Tom Servo getting a new voice on what would effectively be season  of the new series.  Yikes. Haha,MST3K,dgg0eow,8,t5_2qltq

11677395,0,t1_dgjlsk1,The shows Wiki page has a basic rundown of all the production troubles the show had over the years If there have been problems very recently the article doesnt say but it does at least lend a little context to everything.Ive seen a bit of crosstalk here and there over the years about this and basically the common denominator in every disagreement that happened along the way seemed to be Jim Mallon sadly. He was the one who really pushed for them to do a feature film he had some conflict with Joel over production issues which was one of the reasons that Joel left the show Joel later regretted having done this FWIW and overall his insistence on keeping major creative control as well as rights to the show rubbed several cast and crew members the wrong way. What is known is that with both the movie and with the transition to the SciFi Channel there was also a lot of external executive meddling that made things tougher for everyone involved  they were more or less pressured to use This Island Earth for the movie for example and had to deal with a lot of compromises and limitations on the production in case youre wondering why the movie is shorter than the actual episodes of the show! not to mention next to no advertising money being spent to promote it. The SciFi episodes were mandated to have an overarching storyline to connect them which ended up producing mixed results particularly in season . I believe there was also pressure to only riff actual scifi films not sure if this one has any truth to it since even season  dodged that rule with Jack Frost. And at any rate problems with SciFi brass were what ultimately led to the second cancellation after season .As for any bad blood there might be between former cast members I get the feeling that more than anything else some of them have just decided to move on to other things and let the show take whatever direction it will. Interestingly Mike Nelson has stated that hes made almost no money from his involvement in the show since it stopped airing  years ago which should tell something about just how much control over the rights Jim Mallon actually had and was apparently unwilling to part with until recently. The good news is that according to Frank Coniff the former cast members are expected to get some financial compensation from Shout!Factory now thanks partly to the revival and partly to home video sales. So it does seem that Joel is trying to do right by his former colleagues even if theyre not directly involved with the show as it is now.,MST3K,dgjndrn,15,t5_2qltq

He learned too late for himself that men have to find their own way to make their own mistakes. There cant be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves. And when men seek such perfection they find only death... fire... loss... disillusionment... the end of everything thats gone forward.

11800168,0,t3_689wip,Havent seen the last episode yet but of the first thirteen. Starcrash  I think this just hits a sweet spot for me in terms of the kind of movie it is and how good the jokes are. I have all these questions and I know Im putting more thought into the questions than the movie ever put into its plot. Its so stupid but in a really enjoyable way and at times it can be visually appealing.. Carnival Magic  Classic MSTk. Its not Manos or MonsteraGoGo bad as some have said but it reminds me of how boring Castle of Fu Manchu or The Incredibly Strange Creatures... can be. Its more comprehensible than those two but that doesnt do it any favors.. Cry Wilderness  This is such a weird movie. Even if the jokes arent reaching you the movie makes you chuckle with its own craziness often enough. For instance why does the headmaster have a sudden change of heart by the end of the movie? Why does Jim laugh at almost everything? Does the father ever talk in more than one tone of voice?. Avalanche  I love that MSTk took on a s disaster flick. I mean there was San Francisco International but that was a failed TV pilot. They do an excellent job riffing on the crappy notreallylove triangle at the heart of the film and the whole scene with the ambulance ferrying the mother is ridiculous slapstick comedy gold.. The Loves of Hercules  So the plot of this one is Hercules falls in love with Jayne Mansfield right after his wife is killed for no good reason and the plot never gets more complex than Who will get Jayne Mansfield in the end? It really tries to complicate this with more murder and legal finagling but it doesnt work. The ending sketch with the screaming is possibly one of the funniest sketches in the whole shows run.. The Beast of Hollow Mountain  A basic Western that suddenly has a TRex in it whats not to love? Plus how the movie plays up a Mexican laborers alcoholism from missing his dead wife for comic relief.. Wizards of the Lost Kingdom  The return of Truxardus in possibly a goofier movie. What was the point of the Wookie? Were all of Truxarduss dwarf minions played by the same guy?. Time Travelers  I feel like they missed out on pointing out how the old scientist looked like a codgy Norm Macdonald. This seemed like a standard MSTk episode a scifi episode with good riffs but nothing that stood out.. Yongary  To be fair I probably need to watch this one again.. Reptilicus  When it was the only episode available for the early screening I remember thinking it was good but not great. There are a lot of good jokes. Keep Calm and Oskarland...del...skommando. But the riffing is very uneven with long pauses and then a sudden cramming of jokes into short space. As a proof of concept it reassured me that they knew what they were doing and I felt later episodes were better.. The Land That Time Forgot  Another I should probably watch this again episode.. The Christmas That Almost Wasnt  I have never been a big fan of the Christmas movie episodes and I kept being distracted by how dumb an idea it is to base a movie on Santa Claus hiring a babyfaced lawyer to help him pay rent on the North Pole to a Scrooge standin played by a hammy Italian dude. I couldnt get past the premise basically. Or the songs.. Wizards of the Lost Kingdom   I remember being really bored by the movie. David Carradine sure but the kid was the focus and he was godawful. The riffs are okay but not great enough to save it IMO.,MST3K,dgxl8tc,2,t5_2qltq
