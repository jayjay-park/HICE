6920807,0,t1_d10naj2,The cannon scatters a little bit not nearly enough.Also the minimum range means the counter strategy becomes Brawl with the Imperium. Which isnt so much a strategy as assisted suicide. Most of the other strategies proposed like never using escort ships always using silent running and spreading out. Require you to play better than your opponent and build around a threat that may or may not be in play from before second . Not a good way to balance for multiplayer.As for balancing it? More scatter k minimum range and decreasing damage the smaller the ship class and against fortifications.  damage to transports.,BFGArmada,d10spjj,5,t5_3a77e

Any ships that try to close faster than I want I just try to ram away.By keeping all my ships facing their sides after they enemy closes the distance my ships just circle back towards the station and form another firing arc like a ship belt so i can tank hits too.,BFGArmada,d1jxkcc,1,t5_3a77e

7247972,0,t1_d220i5o,gt Do the torpedoes and fighters scale to the higher classes of ship? Or should you start ditching them later on?Torpedoes are just torpedoes  use them to deny space or catch folk unaware. I think the torps for Eldar are smaller but faster from my time playing. Their bombersfighters are an absolute godsend and shouldnt be underestimated. Note that any Line Ship can grab a longcooldown based fighter squadron from the skill upgrades.gt gt What do you their their best defense against ramming is? I know theyre fast but you also have to get a little close and taunt can easily ruin your day if you dont set to broadsides.Well timed use of the solar sail boosts and maneuvers if Im honest. I think that the Vauls Maneuver Instantaneous  degree turn upgrade is a MUST on any lineship  its too damn good. You can use it to reengage after passing through from your first engagement or if someone tries and rams you you can use it to hightail it away from them. As for taunt the good news is that Eldar have an innate resistance to it which reduces the duration. Its still a problem though  I think it depends on the Multiplayer Meta it could be worth taking a defensive skill like the  Holofield for  seconds to just negate it but that isnt going to help you getting rammed.gt Shuriken platform or Pulsar platform? Which escort do you think is best?Shurikens are great for slow but consistent damage while Pulsars will melt a ship if you can land it with correct positioning and prediction. As you get more skilled with Eldar movement youll begin to see the insane value Pulsars bring to the table with CD reduction you can repeatedly nail ships to the wall. Pulsars also have great range if you sink some upgrades into them and can be further improved to melt shields and have  higher crit chance while firing during lock on. That said though I think its good to have a balance of both weapons unless you know your opponents race beforehand.As for Escort I used the Arcanite with the hp hull and  yes I said   more than any Line Ship lol mounted Shuriken Cannons. If youre tasked with taking out structures Id probably go for the Pulsar andor PulsarTorp variant instead but it would be very risky with the HP reduction on those ships.gt Eldar going to be a tall or wide for their fleet comps do you think?Both? You want a wedge formation really with your Pulsar ships at the front and ShurikenSquadron based ships in the rear. That said if the mission gives you a single target to take out I could see a wide formation being used to just encircle and kill it quickly with Pulsars.gt Any ships past the battleship that people should be taking note of in a fleet comp?The Aurora sucks balls until you get it leveled then it becomes a gritty Pulsar staple. Early on you might want to focus on the carrier alternative for its bombers and shuriken cannons as its more consistent. Also the BielTan favour kicks Khaineass!,BFGArmada,d221k7a,3,t5_3a77e

7413152,0,t1_d2krqde,Well if were talking Orkz rather than Imperials yeah. I run a primarily Goff fleet built around ramming boarding and heavy kannon broadsides with bomber support from a Bad Moonz carrier that hangs well back from the brawl launching Shokk Attacks as appropriate.Get a good ram off board with everything blast them with AP heavy kannons for maximum shokk an awe. IMO kannonz gt guns given the amount of time you spend in broadside range at k or less. Paste one ship and move on to the next. A light krooza or two can inflict serious damage on even a battlecruiser and moreso a battlekrooza if the enemy gets caught out by the tactic. If you take the enhanced induction coils skill as Orks it makes ramming significantly more viable enabling you to come about and ram again or just drive headlong at the enemy over just shy of twice the distance as normal catching them off guard and out of position.Fought a pure Evil Sunz fleet last night. Ill admit the Traktor Beamz had me worried and they got a good few rams off. That said though once my Goff ships had been pulled into range we burst damaged our way out in seconds as the entire enemy fleet went insubordinate.On an Imperial note since this particular Tactics Tuesday as opposed to Taktiks Toofsday is supposed to revolve around them one of the other nice things about lances over torps is that your lances cant be shot down prematurely by turrets.,BFGArmada,d2ktrrq,1,t5_3a77e

I got lucky with my meltatorpedo strikes and was able to whittle the vessel down with fires and torpedo strikes finally finishing it off with macrocannon barrages.
