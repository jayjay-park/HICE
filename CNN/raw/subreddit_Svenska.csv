5014996,0,t3_3jm6wa,What you are experiencing are adjective declinations and they are not limited to colors. All adjectives in Swedish must be conjugated after the noun they are describing. Gender en or ett plural or singular definite or indefinite are all factors that must be considered when using an adjective. Example how the word ugly is conjugated in Swedish Ful  UglyIndefiniteEn ful man  An ugly manEn ful kvinna  An ugly womanEtt fult barn  An ugly childFlera fula personer  Several ugly peopleDefiniteDen fule mannen  The ugly manDen fula kvinnan  The ugly womanDet fula barnet  The ugly childDe fula personerna  The ugly peopleAnd now lets do it with a color Rd  RedIndefiniteEn rd man  A red manEn rd kvinna  A red womanEtt rtt barn  A red childFlera rda personer  Several red peopleDefiniteDen rde mannen  The red manDen rda kvinnan  The red womanDet rda barnet  The red childDe rda personerna  The red peopleAs you can see it follows a very regular pattern. From an English perspective this might seem unnecessary but it actually does help us keep track of things in a sentence especially considering that many words in Swedish are identical in their plural and singular forms. Some examples where it comes in handy Arg snickare  Angry carpenterArga snickare  Angry carpentersTrtt barn  Tired childTrtta barn  Tired childrenWhereas you get the information that you are dealing with multiple carpenters and children from the plural endings on the nouns we get it from the plural endings on the adjectives.

8303907,0,t1_d5es9g3,Its a modern pronounciation or contemporary with the reader but the original old language of course. There are possibly some major differences in pronounciation between th century Swedish and current Swedish. The complicated thing though is that it was during the th century that a lot of simolifications were made. In the late Medieval it was the vowel system that became modern vokaldansen  vowel dance and in the th century it was the consonants especially consonant clusters that changed. This is when the sje sounds though not the modern thick one which is later appeared out of sj skj etc. but the rare stj survived for quite some time as stj though like in Norwegian where its still not a sje sound when kj and tj became a tje sound though it was like English ch and not like the modern Swedish one even though this probably also happened during this period for many speakers  when gj and dj became a dje sound like English j and not like a modern Swedish j even though this probably also happened during this period for many speakers when lj hj became a simple j sound and when hv lost the h or rather a voiceless w sound became a voiced w sound then a v sound quite immediate since initial v already was a v sound  thus for some time one had hvete wete wheat but veta veta know this still exists in some dialects. So much happened during say  to  and its not obvious what changes that had occured to a specific person like Stiernhelm.
