9435068,0,t1_d9bvmgl,Frederick Fred Lincoln casually walked into the brewery with his infamous stern look on his face and his equally infamous Colt . He did not really have a history in this city but by the way people were looking at him he thought they must have some suspicions about him. Unknowingly to them he had killed more people than everyone in this brewery combined at least he thought so.He took the best seat in the entire brewery and poured himself a whiskey he brought. He lighted up his cigar and leaned with his chair against the wall. Owners of saloons and breweries usually were too scared to say something to him and he did not expect anyone here to.,CrimsonWest,d9bylc8,2,t5_3gc6n
