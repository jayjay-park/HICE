10225984,0,t3_5mfh6f,Im actually blown away by this! I was okay with not winning but then I see the bonus surprise... Im just really happy right now. Thanks Dauntless team! My entry from the old thread.,dauntless,dc367xo,4,t5_2vmcy
10277589,0,t3_5n5ymw,I think behemoth is just the catch all name like monsters in monster hunter. They have  behemoths confirmed but they all look and behave differently like the bird wyverns and leviathans classes in MH.What I hope for is the devs dont get lazy and just focus only on like  types of monsters. Monster Hunter can feel a bit repetitive when the monsters share the same move sets. In U most monsters charge and have   spins attacks.,dauntless,dc90qzs,2,t5_2vmcy
10364966,0,t3_5oe57h,This may be to early to ask but is the end game loop just grinding gear over and over? Will there be a leader board system or a different end game system?How many monsters is your goal to launch with?Favorite Doughnut?What is something crazy you would like to have in the game but isnt present currentlyblue sky?Will there be trading?ClansGuilds?I wanted to say I love what Ive seen so far. Im a huge MH fan so obviously this looks appealing. I think the core mechanicsdesign of MH is very well done and is something that could be iterated on and improved. I really do think dauntless is my hidden gem this yearno offense but you guys are just starting to grow and get your name out there. Finally from one dev to another good luck. I really want to see this project have success you guys have great community involvement.,dauntless,dcixiwj,11,t5_2vmcy
10373349,0,t1_dcjfj36,Just looking at the graphics and based on the game engine I see it being closer to Paragon. Just a guesstimate though ,dauntless,dcjvqnz,2,t5_2vmcy

11469048,0,t3_63nxro,First can I say holy crap thats expensive.Secondly I really hope this trend in gaming stops and I wish that companies like phoenix that show promise in terms of being customer minded would lead the charge. I understand capital is an issue and money needs to be made but trying to earlyaccess  horseman your way to a functional game is not the way to do it.Showing success postrelease and leading by example would go a long way here. Be confident in standing on the merits of both your game and marketing? ,dauntless,dfw0ebb,15,t5_2vmcy
11473298,0,t1_dfwh4dj,Warframe  Boosts have no negative effect on the community and they are quality and quantity. Its a PvE focused game just like Dauntless.League of Legends  Boosts are great if you want to quickly hit  and farm for more hero options to quickly do league play but for casual players boosts are absolutely ignorable with no negative impact.People will perceive and make bias opinions either because theyve been slighted by eastern developed portovers or because they just have a negative look on FP titles.The game will eventually be FP and when it is they can try it out and eat their assumptions then.The founder packs are absolutely optional as a minmax player Im sure even without boosts I would likely hit endgame and be able to farm endsets just fine with or without the boosts faster than  of the playerbase.Warframe has plenty of a healthy player base M accounts and just on steam average k players. Dauntless cant do worse than that because of its pull in the genre and the studio behind it. Let people have their doubts if this game is for you then dont worry. We are in good hands.,dauntless,dfwhrsu,2,t5_2vmcy

11753136,0,t1_dgs403y,How can you claim that there may be rare cases of people favoring patrons over nonpaying players when we dont even have enough people in the game yet to see what the comparable differences are?The problem this creates is much more than you realize. Theyre segmenting the community by having patron players be more ideal for groups.,dauntless,dgs8x36,0,t5_2vmcy
