2050170,0,t1_cl0c319,First off Britain has always seen themselves as the center of the UK and with London the centerpiece of Britain. British people would be pissed out of their minds about having the capital moved to Wales.Second all central government offices moved to Cardiff Is much easier said then done. If you where moving a state capital that would not be much but the government of arguably one of the most powerful countries on earth is extremely difficult especially when you are moving from a capital of a nation that has been the capital for millennia.Third this would absolutely ruin English Channel trade one of the largest trade routes on earth. Sure Rotterdam would still have trade going through the channel but many many ship routes go to ports near London and with London not being the capital that would shift to Cardiff damaging western European and baltic trade as cargo chips go to Cardiff and then be on their way.Fourth this would loss you a lot of money. Everything british including the monarchy and huge tourist sights are in London not Cardiff. If the royal family would be moved to Cardiff instead. Buckingham Big ben both would just be another building without their cultural and global importance. Fifth Cardiff is extremely small and weak compared to London. Manchester is nearly twice as large as Cardiff for shits sake. Cardiff has a population of  London has a population of  MILLION. Cardiff is simply not a viable city for capital especially when you have the PERFECT capital of London. Literally London is the most important city in the world and even if in game those numbers have changed you are very well the most important city in Cardiff. it is also the world leading city in financing and economics and changing the capital would send that all plummeting down and probably send a crisis your way.,GlobalPowers,cl0f718,2,t5_32d2e

A more unified and strong Latin and South America is the best way to ensure our future prosperity and security during these trying times.I also want to seek further economic openess among the South American community as Uruguay and im sure other states would like to revamp and modernize their economies. Uruguay sits on a mountain of human capital and seeks new high level industry and technology to propel its people and markets forward.Compaeros thank you for allowing me to speak before you today.

This is shown like this  Attack   Attack Modifier d. OR  Attack  . Attack Modifier d. This basically says he has to roll d or ten sided die. Every time he rolls a  he hits. If he rolls a   or  he misses. Lets say he rolls three s. We calculate the damage done to the enemy like this We take the total number of hits multiply it by . This is done because the first equation calculates combat that occurs in  hour. We want the total done in a day or  round.So     . Now lets say they have a defense of . We now subtract that from the daily hits.   . To now convert these hits into number of casualties we multiply it by ..

You dont have to accept the numbers at all. Anyway I said Id adjust the numbers and thats fine. A lot of what my numbers come out to be depend on tactics and the type of fighting going on. Demilitarizing and getting rid of Hamas permanently would result in a lot of deaths of both sides while simply controlling and pushing back Hamas results in less. A more forceful attack by Israel would have a lot more Hamas deaths but also civilian deaths. I could really only guess what you wanted when I plugged everything in.

It is them who defeared ISIS who held up Iraq at its weakest Iraq would not exist without Iran.It also means armed militia can form that the land becomes lawless and rifts are created between nations. Also the fact it is inside Iran implies Iran is the agressor in this conflict.Iraq is liberated for the first time in centuries it is multilateral efforts such as the League of Nstions and NATO that have left Iraq a poor nation rebuilding should be done by local people not by failed organisations.If Iraq does not unify it will split.

5114376,0,t1_cv2fvoj,I can concede that there need to be some readjustment in my reinforcement head count but Im not sure that we are on the same wavelength. Irans justification or a lack thereof should not be the deciding factor on how NATO should or should not station troop within the vicinity. I mean the threat of having an unstable Middle East is enough reason for NATO or allied government to move some troops around let alone an actual war. It shouldnt matter if one side is heavily armed or expected to win the threat of having an active war on your border would warrant a deployment. Regarding Iranian past actions i dont really think that it matters much. So long as the governance in Iran is still theorcratic theres a pretty wide gap of distrust as to warrant an increase in defense deployment. Look at the UAE for example. They are surrounded by stable allied country barring Iran across the strait and yet they have UK and Frances military presence. There are absolutely no chance Iran would attack UAE but theres still troops there for strategic reason. If we need a decades of justification every time we want to deploy in third party state which is near the incident we should just scrap the idea of foreign deployment altogether. Of course there need to be some and quite serious too. But I do believe an active war would suffice. Also on the point of NATO expenditure I did address that point at the start of the game. ,GlobalPowers,cv2h24u,1,t5_32d2e

5365491,0,t1_cvxhweb,gt As of  Czech RepublicRussian Federation relations are at very good level. On December   Russian president Dmitry Medvedev visited Prague because of the signature of important economic contracts and cultural exchange. Both countries consider each other as an important economic partner.Even during the crisis both arent aggressive to each other while worried there has been no real action against each other. Czechs are a bit distrustful of Russia but they arent going to the extremes of supporting war against them and being like Poland.

5443298,0,t1_cw3n3nj,Previous player here. Just wanted to give you a little background on why I decreased the Benelux National Armed Forces in the first place. First of all Benelux is completely surrounded by relatively peaceful NATO members so there is really no need for a large military. Secondly the Dutch Belgian and Luxembourgish militaries are tiny IRL compared to their respective neighbors. In fact the Netherlands sold its last tank in  IIRC. Throughout its history Benelux hasnt been involved in any wars whatsoever. However a ship was sent to protect Dutch overseas territories when Cuba invaded an island in the Caribbean sometime in the s.Benelux has tended to focus more on urban development and increasing education which is how it got to be so rich in the first place. Tread lightly when it comes to the military of Benelux my friend. Its resistance to expansion is one of the things that has made Benelux a powerful nation. ,GlobalPowers,cw7fmgg,1,t5_32d2e

6280982,0,t1_cz3i2le,gt Iran has had sovereignty over these islands since .Iran tried to assert their claimed sovereignty in  but were quickly sent running with their tails between their legs by the British  who noted that Iran did so to create a narrative over their fictitious claims. If Iran however wishes to assert that it attacked a protectorate of the British Empire and gained de facto control over the islands in  then the delusion of Iran on this matter knows no bounds.gt It is also important to note that the Qasimi rulers of the th and th century were based on Persian not Arab coast. They were therefore subjects of the Persian Crown.This has been dealt with and dispelled. The Qasimi ruled from  Ras alKhaimah in the UAE at no point were the Qasimi based in Persia  though they did administer part of it. gt It is also important to note that the islands of the Greater and lesser Tunb were previously uninhabited by civilians and no deportations of Arabs were ever made.This is not true and does not hold up with testimony from inhabitants about their experiences during the Iranian invasion of their homes. The testimony of Fatima al Tamimigt Tunbs older citizens were taken to the police station where they signed a document instructing them to leave the island on the condition that they could return within three days. That promise was never fulfilled.gt When the fishermen returned for noon prayers they and their families were all put on boats and shipped to Ras al Khaimah in a sevenhour ordeal.,GlobalPowers,cz3ksq4,1,t5_32d2e

You can ask Georgia themselves for their opinion on the matter upokemonprime. Oh wait they already have said their opinion multiple times  . We were strongly committed to Russia and were fighting a war that we would obviously lose out of loyalty to Russia. We would have continued our commitment had we not found out that Russia had deceived us despite our loyalty to them. They had drawn us into the war under false pretenses. While we had believed that they were the subject of a cruel terrorist attack by Lithuania that began the war we later learned as did the rest of the world that Russia had actually staged the terrorist attack itself. By bringing us into the war under false pretenses they had exploited our loyalty and caused thousands of Armenian men and women to die for a false cause.

8677019,0,t1_d6pv7i3,The judiciary branch in Belarus is fairly weak and insubstantial and has primarily been used in the past to punish political opposition or provide rubber stamps of approval to executive actions so some strengthening is definitely necessary. It is certainly true that the key to a strong and free state and its protection is a strong judiciary and if the new Belarusian Republic is to survive against future internal threats then a strong judiciary will become crucial.As far as election policies are concerned we feel that a minimum vote percentage being required for candidacy in any position at any level may prematurely stifle the diversification of the Belarusian political scene which is a process we hope to encourage in the wake of the coup and its shockwaves. But as the Belarusian system is not proportional representation but rather has seats representing different ridings which are each won by FPTP polls this is not necessarily applicable. As far as ethnic minority parties may be concerned this way of filling seats may only allow their parties to win seats in ridings where the populations they represent are highly concentrated or the general populations political preferences are widely divided which is concerning.We deeply thank Poland for providing us with the Balcerowicz plan and it will be certainly be passed onto Minsk for consideration and debate. The advice you are giving us on economic matters is reinforcing the position we were hoping would be the best to adopt in that caution and restraint must be exercised in a gradual unfreezing of the economy and that a wildwest clearance sale program such as was carried out in Russia is completely out of the question.We also greatly appreciate your advice on managing debt and deficits but such issues are relatively low priority for our government at this time.M I appreciate the economic advice a lot but boy that shit is complex.

We recognize Iran as an important friend in the Middle East region and we look forward to creating mutually beneficial agreements between our two nations.  For your first proposal China is completely in favor of this and we are willing to discuss this point further. We are willing to send geological engineers to Iran to assist in exploring the oil fields and to determine as close as is possible the full extent of oil present at the proposed location. We are also in agreement with the costs of the project and will happily fund half of the venture. China would agree to the construction of such a port. We would be willing to fund s of the venture with Iran so that we may bring ourselves closer economically. We will construct the port to handle regular cargo as well for increased trade between our nations with regard to goods other than oil and its derivatives. On the next two points concerning the construction of an automotive plant from the SAIC Motor Corporation we are willing to accept this venture under the terms proposed. Additionally with regard to the next point we would be willing to work with Iranian scientists researchers and academics in these new industrial parks to promote greater technological development between our two nations. China proposes Iran send scientists and researchers to China as well to work alongside Chinese scientists to further assist in the dissemination of ideas and new technology. China would agree to this move to allow HESA to work with our aerospace companies however we would like to go a step further and propose replacing your Fs with Chinese fighters which are more modern and around the same price. Would Iran be open to discussing this? This way China can assist in maintaining these fighters and providing parts for them at low costs. It will also increase interoperability between our two militaries. On your final point China will agree to the cooperation of Irans DIC and NORINCO with regard to RampD however we would like to know which items Iran plans to develop so that we may most effectively provide assistance. We agree to the sale of production licenses for the items you have listed and NORINCO will stand by for further requests should Iran require it. With regard to pricing on your requested items we have prepared a table to show the costs for each piece of hardware. This is assuming items produced new and not used.|Type|Cost||||KJ AWAC Aircraft| per copyYG EW Aircraft| per copyY Transport Aircraft| per copyY Strategic Transports| per copyJ Air Superiority Aircraft| per copyVP APCs| per copyWe would like to inquire whether or not Iran would seek to upgrade its navy or would they be content as it is currently?On your second point China would agree to this survey. Iran would need to provide specifics on what projects they seek to carry out in what order so costs can be determined and equipment requisitioned. We look forward to further cooperation between our two nations and a flourishing of our relationship.Regards Xi Jinping President of China,GlobalPowers,db106y1,1,t5_32d2e

10429542,0,t1_dcodgoa,To The Foreign Affairs Minister of the Republic of India Akash Patel From Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Javad Zarif Wonderful! We can see to the details of these now that we have a verbal agreement once I make these last few proposals and then Id be happy to hear any which you might have.As I know youre well aware the Islamic Republic of Irans roadways were EXTREMELY poorly planned when they were constructed and were barely maintained by the previous Supreme Leaders Ministers. This has led to Irans system of roadways quite simply being some of the most dangerous roads in the world due a combination of poor design neglect and even Irans rough terrain. At present Iran has  kms of highways considered essential as tradetransportation corridors these are in comparative good shape to the  kms of major roads and  kms of minor roads that connect Irans small towns villages and rural areas. These roads over  kms worth are absolutely awful and are VERY poorly maintained because of the failings of previous Transportation and Interior Ministers. The Ministry of Transportation has recently conducted a study focused on the potential upgrade of all  kms of Iranian roadways to first world standards and the study concluded that such an ambitious would take an investment of  however the Supreme Leader feels that this ambitious yet very achievable project is an ABSOLUTE must for the Islamic Republic of Iran to achieve its full potential.This is made even more apparent a need as much of Irans energy and mineral wealth lay in these rural poorly serviced areas. While the oil pipeline project Iran is undertaking with the PRC will address the problems of transporting Iranian energy efficiently to market. This project has no effect on the full exploitation of Irans mineral wealth for the obvious fact that minerals cant be pumped via pipeline.. Due to the fact that Iran and India are seeking to greatly expand in our trade of Iranian minerals and Indian agricultural products its ABSOLUTELY necessary that Iran and India work together to invest in bringing the roadways of the Islamic Republic of Iran into the st century so that IndoIranian trade can truly flourish.Therefore the Islamic Republic of Iran seeks to begin work on this most important of projects with the Republic of India as our partner. India is more than willing to send a team of experts to conduct their own study which may lower the  total investment that our experts have come up with. However the Islamic Republic of Iran implores India to move quickly as Iran seeks to begin boosting the bilateral trade between our two states ASAP due to the obvious benefits that itll provide both of our nations. Once India agrees to this project Iran shall provide our share of the necessary investment within our  budget so that construction can begin immediately next year. Finally the Islamic Republic of Iran is engaged in aiding nations far and wide from Cuba to the Bantu Federation and due to the state of the Iranian Naval Auxillary Fleet Iran is forced to rely on the strategic transport capabilities of the Iranian Air Force which though both significant and fast simply cant transport to volume of humanitarian aid that ships can.. To improve the capability of the Iranian Navy to deliver aid and humanitarian supplies and to more efficiently supply Irans sparsely populated Persian Gulf Islands which rely on the Iranian Navy as a lifeline the Iranian Navy would like to purchase x AdityaClass Auxiliary Ships from Indias Garden Reach Shipbuilders amp Engineers LTD So desperate is the need of the Iranian Navy that funds can be transferred to Garden Reach Shipbuilders amp Engineers LTD from the Iranian budgets discretionary fund.The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that this purchase of AdityaClass Auxiliary Ship has the potential to lead to further cooperation between our respective military industries and armed forces which could result in numerous jointprojects and a general closeness developing between our two armed forces. Seeing as the Iranian Armed Forces and Indian Armed Forces currently use LARGE amounts of the same equipment sourced primarily from the Russian Federation or Embraer the Iranian Armed Forces also believe that our respective armed forces could engage in HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL jointexercises with one another once our two nations find the time right to do so. Not only would this improve our capabilities and interoperability itd also send a VERY STRONG message to Pakistan.These are all of the Islamic Republic of Irans current proposals should the Republic of India have any additional proposals please dont hesitate to put them forward now. The Islamic Republic of Iran also requests Indias opinion on the civilian casualties caused as a result of the IDFs launching of the Second Gaza War. While Iran understands that Hamas was using civilians as human shields we do not feel that this is ANY excuse. Any rational military would send in special forces into these buildings to deal with these miscreants to avoid civilian casualties. To simply blow the buildings up with missiles is callous and bordering on cowardice as Iran believes Soldiers have a duty to die should their death result in civilians being saved. Sincerely Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Javad Zarif ,GlobalPowers,dcq9a7r,1,t5_32d2e
