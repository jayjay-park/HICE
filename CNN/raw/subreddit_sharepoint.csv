327167,0,t1_cfcanrp,I manage the training for our hospital by receiving Outlook email requests for booking venues and training events. Each training evolution has to be uploaded onto SharePoint inside our Command Training Calendar.This normally wouldnt be an issue but our internet speed ranges on average from  kbps so updated the calendar from SharePoint takes longer because of all the irrelevant items which load on the page while Im trying to update the calendar therefore Id rather use the syncd version of the calendar inside of Outlook.Besides the internet speed it is just easier to to copy and paste from the messages inside my outlook to the calendar inside outlook which also saves time.For some reason I strongly believe Im getting the error because we are using MS Office  on our work computers but the SharePoint uses . But I was able to sync the calendars and update the SharePoint calendar from my Outlook back in October. Im not exactly sure what change occurred or where.I hope this helped clarify. If you have any other suggestions please let me know.Thank you in advance!,sharepoint,cfeojn7,1,t5_2qhtx

832821,0,t1_cgymegs,Thanks for the reply. I have to use a custom connector due to the nature of the repository. Since I am connecting to our DMS I need to index the metadata in the database and the associated file which also includes custom security mapping. I am certainly not ruling out holes in the connector. I have rewritten the code several times but these types of projects are notoriously hard to profile. the only problem with that logic is how well the full crawl works and the fact that I do index newly added and updated items during the incremental but the crawl never finishes. It seems like if there was a resource issue with my code it would have appeared during the superintensive full crawl.Thanks again for the input.,sharepoint,cgyxzw4,1,t5_2qhtx

2511525,0,t1_cmmcqrx,By simply deactivating publishing or saving the site as template afterwards and migrating it?Honestly I would not do the save as template approach if Im stuck with only whats available oob I would much rather do an exportimport.However for OP you need to make absolutely sure that you use the same site template both places as well as have all the same features activated etc.. before you actually do the import. There might also be some other custom settings that youll need to change manually like default page custom logo basically any kind of setting that you can set.Also keep in mind that if you want to migrate a subsite to a root web then you probably have some references to resources located on the root web of the source subsite that you will need to manually copy over and set the proper references for on the destination site.

3644985,0,t1_cq7bszl,not really... compared to no system most prototypes can be handled by SPF functionality... so the cost is just a windows server CAL or two depending if SQL is separate and possibly SQL if the limitations in Express are an issue. Many orgs already have SharePoint so the investment in CALs is already addressed. prototyping assumes the following  dev costs are MUCH lower since its usually performed by end users  power users with lists and web parts and is often much QUICKER to build than any officially deved solution.  similar to the Agile methodology the business is able to start benefiting from the prototype... benefits can be cost reduction increased  competitive capabilities etc... but either way they are helping the company save or earn money. prototyping determines the actual business needs and priorities much more effectively than having some business analyst. from a prototype its not overly difficult to improve around formality... replace UIs that are limiting with something like JS that is able to overcome the previous limitations and can also be tested. if for any reason the app is determined to move OUT of SharePoint...  for a minimal prototype a business analyst can use the prototype as a frame of reference for requirements gathering or a developer can use it as a frame of reference for functional requirements and testingvalidation  for more advanced systems with JavaScript based UIs much of the JS can be brought directly into a new dev solution with minimal effort remapping the data queries.Agile and Prototyping are about helping the business save and earn money...

3765013,0,t1_cqlcdnq,TLDR from your survey data take the amount of people who do use it eg  compare that to the total number of possible users eg  your user adoption is .. you can get more in depth by looking at the number of high use users and medium use users and track this over time.I guess when your talking about user adoption of any service you compare it to what they were using before or the other available methods. in my case I could compare company announcements on SharePoint to companywide emails. Or how many files are on this site compared to how many files are on this drive. Thinking outside of SharePoint you can look at user adoption of say Twitter by looking at the number of signups and compare those numbers to the number of signups to other social media companies.  users on twitter to  users on Facebook bad adoption.But if youre bringing something totally new to market maybe an apple watch you might not want to compare that to normal watches or other brands of watches which are also new but look closer at the total amount of possible users and then the amount of current users. In your situation perhaps you could look at the number of users who say they use SharePoint vs the total number of possible users. You said you have survey data on how often people are using SharePoint you could break that down into groups of users and non users then compare the number of users to the total number of possible users in your organisation.Alternatively Lets say you didnt have an intranet and now you do what do you compare against? well I suppose you cant compare something against nothing so get specific what features are implemented in your SharePoint that are being used? Something else we found is the logs dont lie we had one of our top level management say off hand no one uses sharepoint especially in X department. we pulled off an analytics report of the top users and  out of the  top users were in that department. Hopefully that helps if not let us know what your using SharePoint for and what you might of been using in the past as substitute and we might be able to help fine tune it.,sharepoint,cqlfuln,1,t5_2qhtx

I never knew of a CryptoVirus when i set theirs up as i had only been in IT for  months. Granted they never moved to SharePoint but thats not down to any lack in my ability or attitudeAll i wanted to know is if the files will become encrypted on SharePoint if the Library is mapped to an infected PC and if the version history in SharePoint will be affected.

8362447,0,t3_4sd1po,To be honest the most helpful thing for me was to create a dev site collection and try every single menu option through site settings all the apps and all the ribbon buttons in listslibraries. A lot of SharePoints quirkiness doesnt get translated properly into training it helps to try to use it various ways and see what worksdoesnt work what looks like it would be useful but is not or what looks inconspicuous but is actually super useful. For instance I discounted SP custom lists when I was first learning but then came to find them to be one of the most useful features of SharePoint and now use them all the time.

If you are doing reports using PowerQuery beacuse frankly who wants static dashboards? then PowerBI is not much different. Actually I had very little experience with PowerQuery and I found PowerBI to be extremely easy to use without any extra training. Sure there are some complexities if you are doing combiniations of data sources and what not... but I find it much easier to use than Excel.Plus you can add your Excel Files into PowerBI... Then you can just use that data as a datasource to create very rich visuals in PowerBI. ,sharepoint,dd7816g,2,t5_2qhtx
10614216,0,t1_ddarde4,Thanks that is essentially what I ended up doing once I wrapped my head around CSOM. It was the realization that the forms are their own objects separate from the list items as you explain that helped me.As for PnP I was not overly impressed. I came across an earlier version of the authors work that he abandoned for PnP which made heavy use of creating arbitrary variables in the global scope. I avoid that like the plague. Then with PnP he went for a true cmdlet as opposed to a module of functions. This makes the source code more of a pain to analyze imo. And I wasnt about to use it without vetting the code after seeing him abuse the global scope previously.Now that I understand CSOM a bit more Im fine writing my own function wrappers into a module. ,sharepoint,ddarxre,1,t5_2qhtx
