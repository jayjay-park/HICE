154304,0,t1_cevy64b,Thank you for all of the information! We live in florida so it definitely gets hot here in the summer and early fall. However our dog would probably spend most of at time indoors and only be outside while supervised. The community we are moving into is very shaded lots of trees!... do you think this will be enough? Also the dog park is located under trees as well. ,roughcollies,cew08zo,1,t5_2tl6v

10499628,0,t1_dcy7two,Thanks!!  Not entirely sure his breed!  We may never know he came from a overflowing shelter in the USA to a foster home here in Toronto where we picked him up.  All we know is Collie cross so your guess is as good as mine.  The speckled paws always seemed very Aussie Shepherdesque and he has that herding personality Ive been herded my cats everyone. Im pretty tempted to try one of those DNA test kits...,roughcollies,dcy8s40,2,t5_2tl6v
