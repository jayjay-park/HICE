1675460,0,t1_cjqc7i2,There are some great videos on youtube for grinders. They are kinda nerfed on Aftermath though due to XP and mob drop tweaks. Youre better off just exploring clearing buildings and looting to be honest... unless you just want to build one for the challenge. ,vaast,cjqcqxj,3,t5_2yth3

2048131,0,t3_2i9a7w,My experience with Minecraft Realms has been horrendous. Me and some friends wanted a vanilla server to play on and whenever there was more than  people on you would get terrible lag. Blocks breaking multiple times jumping from point to point and low FPS. We got it fixed but lag was always slight. That was in vanilla. If you add  buildings roads custom nether and hundreds of mobs and  players you will not be able to play. The cost is only like  USD a month. ,vaast,cl05uxg,2,t5_2yth3

2195646,0,t3_2k6cfr,Yay! Rallying cry! So for various reasons including several stints in hospital I havent been around much recently but Aftermath was and is the best server Ive ever played on. And to quote SpliffBob I had the best gaming experience of my life. Hoping he will see this and elaborate....I cant speak for the whole community obviously however surely we could advertise Aftermath across the interwebs? A huge amount of work went into this season perhaps we as the players can help by bringing new lambs to the slaughter?  Finding a good server is difficult so Im certain there are many potential survivors out there trawling through lists of awful anarchy servers just waiting to hear about this incredible place......,vaast,clix5db,5,t5_2yth3
2205533,0,t1_clix6ct,Well why does it have to be different from the loot chests? Top tier loot in loot chests requires luck. Players would know that A random drop chest with broadcasted coords would have great loot to attract them.,vaast,clk6dpv,1,t5_2yth3

Lets be specific and get into an example You enticed us with promises of building a lair to lure in other players in hopes of killing them on your property. The main way prepvp was a lava bucket in a dispenser. Now I cant do that?! Please come to my base disarm all my traps and then have at my stove. We voted for chests only.
