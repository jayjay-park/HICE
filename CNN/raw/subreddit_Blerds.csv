807744,0,t3_233izy,Ive been watching arrow agents of shield continuum and archer.  When I get more free time I plan on finishing up misfits on hulu. Misfits is sort of like heroes but not focused on using their powers to save the world. Just trying to get by really. Really interesting British show.,Blerds,cgw3fa0,2,t5_315ls
2760310,0,t3_2r5d0o,I have dated one non nerd my ex and one nerd my SO I have only met one other female blerd like myself during college and since I moved away we just talk via facebook. My SO is not the same race but nerdom is a big part of my life so it was a big part of what I looked for in a partner. So it is kind of more what you think of as the ideal hang out. For me playing Divinity Original Sin on CoOp mode with some pizza is awesome weekend time.  I do wish I knew other blerds though I grew up with them as a kid all my brothers friends who essentially always looked after me ,Blerds,cnhu4ij,1,t5_315ls
2815500,0,t1_cnnnmwl,ltsighsgtStuff like that is so overtly problematic and whilst we might look to indigenous Japanese customs as being partially at fault for this the Game Theorists on YouTube did a pretty comprehensive take on historicising racism in Pokemon we cant really deny that the global ideamarketplace of the latetwentiethearly twentyfirst century should not have allowed for folk to think that this kind of thing was cool.Fun Fact also look up Dakkochan dolls for some additionally problematic consumable iconography.  I some of these on sale in Odaiba as recently as ! Again though I think it speaks as much to importation of tropes and hurtful images  of Blackness that come from an antecedent historical moment as they do to Japanese cultural practices.  Meanwhile I heard somewhere that when Perry first arrived in Edo in the s one of the wondrous manifestations of modernity that he had to share with the Shogunate was a Minstrel show.  Im not even lying.  So if exposure to this particular brand of culturally appropriated and damning misrepresentation of what it meant to be Black dates as far back as the preMeiji era thats hard to overturn though admittedly there was some folklore about Yasuke a reallife Black samurai and courtier to Nobunaga that predates even this phenomenon.Dude  Popo aggravates me.  I do talk about him as a signifier in the class but Im actually still rather curious as to Toriyamas rationale for including him in the first place.  Like why?  And then there is the matter of his attire turban etc..  Ive heard that Blackness as a racial signifier in Japan speaksspokehistorically to peoples of the Indian subcontinent too but that seems to indicate to me a collapsing of two different takes on what it means to be Otherized in this way the samboesque face and the Orientalist exoticism of the outfit.  Problematic all around...Of course thats just my opinion.  Sorry I didnt document all my sources for you guys here but if you are interested in the history of BlackJapanese relations there are a ton of useful books on the subject.  Works that deal with the frustrating forms of racialisation e.g. John Dowers War without Mercy and works that also speak to more positive interactions such as Onishis Transpacific Antiracism and Mullens W. E. B. Du Bois on Asia.,Blerds,cno45dm,4,t5_315ls
