10657132,0,t3_4xbb2d,Interesting theory! I love thanking of alternate possibilities to why characters do what they do on TV shows and movies. There are multiple episodes where Gilligan was not as upset as the rest of the castaways when the rescues dont work out. Im reminded of the ending of Rescue From Gilligans Island when they end up back on the island and Gilligan says Were Home. The only problem with your theory is that many of the failed rescues were not directly caused by Gilligan.,GilligansIsland,ddf79k1,1,t5_2tgq3
