Homeless service organizations work on shoestring budgets and time crunches and often our appointments fill up two hours after we open simply due to the need.My mom a lifetime social service person who worked with children from troubled backgrounds in the school systems taught me a useful technique Ill paraphrase as thoughtful repetition. If your hands are tied in regards to the aid you can provide that day and the person youre trying to help wont take no for an answer calmly explain the policies and rules in different ways until they accept it and move on.

Do your best to not let anyone know if you have any valuables on you. No one should know if you receive or have money or food stamps. Apply for food stamps if you dont already receive them. As soon as you have your fs approval letter sign up for a lifeline food stamp phone. Save it for emergency use only if you can. Keep a small knife on you at all times. If you know how to handle yourself with a blade? Keep your hygiene up as well as you can. Find a way to wash your clothes weekly. When you sleep at night and allowed to have a backpack with you? Use luggage locks to keep night owls from prying in your bag. Also tie your backpack to yourself or your bed. Use your shoes as a pillow too. Like put them under the mattress. Keeps night owls from taking your shoes. Ive seen a many pair of shoes stolen in my time at a homeless shelter. If the homeless shelter provides food? Be careful what you eat. The one I stayed in had up to  of your closest and newest friends. So you would think great three meals a day would be decent. Not a chance.  I lost  pounds in the first month.

7152148,0,t3_4da6cu,Advice? This story sounds familiar and I remember what happened last time I took the time but since you explicitly asked for it heres what I think needs to happen and the jokesters downvoting uberlincalling who have nothing to contribute need to leave this sub alone and go find their catharsis elsewhere. Here it goesGet emergency loans enroll full time k at a major university for a third year student is fine. Stay off academic probation and seriously consider talking to a therapist. You might be subconsciously sabotaging yourself as a cry for help adding stressors to an already overwhelming situation which already sounds like academic suicide.Most of what youve written is much ado about your personal narrative the story in your mind and the script youre following you identity and persona. You get cartharsis from overthinking things and verbalizing that chaos to an audience. I can relate but its a bad habit. You need to get your catharsis from action not rhetoric.gt The only logical thing I could think to do is to give up paying rentFor someone who overthinks this seems like a woefully simplistic solution. Trust me you have better options but Im convinced theres a hurdle maybe youre probably on academic probation or something which cuts out all or most of your good options. Hypothetically if your best option at this point was to drop out and regroup until you have the money to finish your degree when youre ready it would be the last thing youd want to hear ... that is until that decision is forced on you anyway the prospect of which might be the primary source of your anxiety. I hope it isnt as bad as all that.If the decision comes down to taking out more loans or becoming homeless the answer is to take more loans. You dont need us to tell you that thats something you should be able to do on your own without overthinking it. You dont need a therapist to make your decisions for you either. You just need guidance and possibly medication to help you to stop undermining your own success and happiness by overthinking.,homeless,d1r4lw0,2,t5_2qtcb

I would recommend connecting with a social worker as I suggested and tell him or her what you told me.  There may be a relocation fund for the very purpose of relocating homeless to family  you would be eligible.  Programs like that exist in San Francisco and Los Angeles... and Ill bet Seattle too as it also has a serious homeless problem.The value of your personal possessions depend on how old they are how used they are  but really theyre of more value to you.If you panhandled somewhere and advertised that you needed  to get to Kansas Ill bet in  days you could raise what you needed particularly if you tapped local clergy to assist.
