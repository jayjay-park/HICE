276291,0,t3_1x9uzk,Runes will start dropping from anything in the game very rarely!There are  different kinds so i hope you have bank space ready.Leveling up your Enchanter lets you put Runes on gear in two ways You can put a single Rune in each of your Slot  items granting them small bonuses to single stats like Crit Rating Area Damage Rating etc. You can put a Runeword on your UruForged Item slot which requires multiple runes of different types to complete the recipe.  This Runeword comes with a whole bunch of stats and effects that are much more noticeable than the single rune enchants.You can get mores Runes by stacking Special Item Find and it seems some will be given as Daily Login Rewards too.Runes can be traded between players and fit in the Crafting bank tab.

It just takes more active effort with positioning rotation and power interaction.  That requirement makes Daredevil and to a lesser extent Nightcrawler and Moon Knight more engaging and fun for me.Objectively I know that Storm and Iron Man are tops on the list independent of fun factor.

729839,0,t3_22ijxy,Im going to buck the trend and agree that a reversal would be nice.Personally Ive got no horse to back in this. Ive only got  s and none of them are prestiged so the presence of such a feature is irrelevant to me. But that doesnt mean that I cant empathise with other people. I can also very easily use my imagination to see a few circumstances where a reversal would be a useful featureExample  Tom loves playing Daredevil and has advanced him to red prestige. His younger brother also plays although only casually. One morning whilst Tom is afk getting a glass of orange juice his younger brother Mark takes advantage of the few minutes Tom is away to sign up his brother for cosmic prestige clicking past all the warning dialogs. Mark thinks this is really funny. Tom not so much.Example  Sarah was recently unemployed and spent a lot of time on her Storm. During all her free time she has advanced her Storm to Cosmic . But then a job offer comes through. She needs to be ready to start work in a weeks time and with the demands of her new job together with existing commitments Sarah can see that she will be now be restricted to playing only a dozen hours a week. Theres no way she can contemplate completing her journey through cosmic prestige.Example  Jason is a really hardcore player. He has advanced his prestige Loki to level  already. However his wrist is starting to hurt and yesterday when he visited his doctor he was told that due to already working with computers in his office job he should no longer game more than  hours a week or risk permanent damage due to RSI. His cosmic dreams are over.TLDR This is fundamentally a game. People play to have fun but often have real lives that will on occasion intrude on their gaming. People get new jobs have children relatives die or become ill. Sht happens. What is the harm of a feature that allows players to adjust their gaming commitments when their reallife circumstances change. Last time I checked the agreement to accept cosmic prestige isnt a contract with the devil signed in blood.,marvelheroes,cgn8ixk,10,t5_2uhpg

1173716,0,t1_ci1n1ji,So I dont know off the top of my head how many heroes there are so lets call it n.  Im also going to call the number of heroes you already own x just for the sake of making this general.That means on any given box you have nxn chance of getting a new hero but if we want to talk about multiple boxes we do something else.  Instead we calculate the odds of only getting heroes you already have because then you can easily infer the odds of getting at least one new hero from that.So the odds of getting a hero you already have are xn.  We want to know what amount will give us a d chance so were take this equation    xnb  d and solve for b where b is the number of boxes you buy.  xnb  d xnb    db  logxn  logdb  logdlogxnAnd finally to make it more readableNumber of boxes  log  desired chance of getting a new hero  logheroes owned  heroes totalIf youre taking this equation into a calculator or spreadsheet or something else that allows you to specify the base of the logarithm instead of using  or e you can simplify this by one further by doing logd with base xn.One final note is this is the number of boxes needed for at least one new hero.  The calculation for the odds of only one new hero is more complicated and I dont feel like doing it.,marvelheroes,ci1nw07,3,t5_2uhpg

1228422,0,t1_ci7kwkx,I would say that logic confuses infinite retcons with infinite skill points.  Infinite skill points devalues the skill tree because you can max every ability.  Infinite retcons dont devalue the skill tree because value in how you spent your points is assumed when you engage in a fight.  As far as game mechanics go how you spent your points will have exactly equal value as if you could only spend them once.What limited retcons do is impose a set of values on the human process that cant be quantified in game mechanics.  It values theoretical planning predicting how abilities will work together and devalues empirical planning testing how abilities work together.  It values looking up cookie cutter builds and devalues experimental builds. It also values complacency and devalues curiosity.So there isnt inherently more value in a limited retcon system it just determines what behavior you value more.,marvelheroes,ci7td4k,6,t5_2uhpg

I think it only feels that bad when you go for them only specially if they may have lowered the drop rates. I only saw it as an extra to what i was doing and cant really complain about what I got p.

1320494,0,t3_2974c2,Its pretty incredible how David Brevik saved this game during this past year. I originally dismissed Marvel Heroes because it looked like a crappy moneygrab game which it was. I really wanted to play the game since I used to be a huge Marvel fan as a kid. But the lack of polish and content at launch along with lack of Gambit prevented me from playing.I just started MH  weeks ago. This game is incredible and I havent been able to stop playing. Ive also spent over  planning on spending more something I only ever do with great games and have never done with a free to play game. MH is taking the action RPG genre where it has never been before injecting true MMO aspects to the game. Diablo  can only wish it was half as good as MH is right now. Path of Exile while a good game is stuck trying to emulate Diablo  to do what MH has done and is going to do with the ARPG genre.Hats off to Mr. Brevik. Hes done it again. The guy who started the legendary Blizzard North studio and helped create the Diablo series is now revolutionizing the genre he helped make popular. The future is very bright for Marvel Heroes. I hope they continue to improve this game and listen to the players  customers  fans for years to come.,marvelheroes,cii681r,12,t5_2uhpg

Surely Gaz has an unlimited staff on standby so as not to bother the ones working on every single other thing people complain about! And surely if anything bad were to come they would do this work out of the kindness of their hearts. So surely this will never have any effect at all on developer resources or money!  So heck let us all just stand by confident Gaz is wrong in their own opinion of this and well just ignore the buildup of botting and if it ever is a problem well Gaz has it handled!  Yall are coming across as a bunch of kids looking at a hooker calling her cute and harmless and trusting her enough to not wear protection. You know that saying? An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure? It is said for a reason.  Ill say it again for you If you believe so firmly then start a petition to allow botting. I will be waiting for your success story!   I guess youre just getting into this thread so all this hostility is not pointed simply at you just part of it. ,marvelheroes,cilgc0m,-1,t5_2uhpg

1403319,0,t3_2a5jds,Crafting system needs a huge overhall to be useful. I see where they were going and felt like it was a need but it was a tacked on system. It wasnt really thought out. The UI sucks most current recipes suck and the list of crafting sucks. I understand Gaz wants to make money but there are definitely other ways to make money rather than gating your user to pray to the RNG for it to drop or waste  splinters when you know they want another hero vs UM crafting mat. The entire thing just needs a major overhaul to make it look useful and thats pretty much it. I also dont understand the  uniques that MUST be dupes to use the recipe. Why?  I also dont understand why is a retcon so valuable to Gaz. Its being used by omegas.. why? I dont understand why they are punishing users to even trying the system out sure we can argue that during beta youre getting free resets during every change but once its done we wont. Plus most users arent even at  so I ask again why are we being charged when we have  or ? Its far more valuable when youre resetting at a higher number than you are at lets say at . I understand a business is a business but cmon man be a bit reasonable when youre trying to get my money. I just find it absolutely terrible that youre just trying the system out at such an early stage only to be punished. I also dont see why my skills dont reset with the omega since youre making an entire new build that possibly doesnt use the same omega points. ,marvelheroes,cis6ppc,2,t5_2uhpg

Take away his optics and he is nothing but a normal human that can shout commands to people NOTHING more.  If he walked up to the hulk and punched him in the face hulk would laugh and then make him into a pancake.While the MA tree may be mandated by Marvel it is still a waste of a tree.  The vast majority doesnt want to play Cyclops to run up and punch someone in the nose.  They want to play Cyclops to blast shit to pieces with laser beam eyeballs.Edit  If they really want a third non optic tree what about a summoning tree like Luke Cage.

People accept only the best aka those with the highest number not players you have fun playing with usually so they can have their loot. Content is held from players who dont want that items too etc....Its a ARPG and raid as excepted doesnt work in it.

I got three costumes in that pack. I didnt like any of them so I put all three into the random costume recipe and got back an Invisible Women. While it did say random it didnt specify if it would be any of the  costumes or random for my current hero random for any of the heros I own ect. So I filed a ticket. Got my wolverine pack replaced after deleting the Invisible Women costume used the Punisher Costume I had and two Wolverine costumes in the same random costume recipe and got back....Old man Wolverine.

1650876,0,t3_2d8bnf,I also grew up watching s cartoons like XMen Amazing SpiderMan and Batman the Animated Series. XMen was easily my favorite. Thankfully I had cousins and neighbors that were into video games and comics. One of my neighbors had one of those foil embossed covers of Venoms first or second appearance. I was amazed!I started buying XMen and Green LanternKyle Rayner comics and Marvel collectible cards. Marvel was just making more and better video games than DC. I did like the Batman Returns video game though. Then there was that XMen arcade game that like every arcade had. It didnt take me long to find the pilot for Pryde of the XMen VHS at some bargain store. I loved that one too.I stopped playing video games and reading comics through high school and college. A few years ago I was convinced to give comic books and PC gaming a try. I got into WoW FFXIV SWTOR and some indie games. D was a huge disappointment for me initially. I tried Marvel Heroes in beta and then the first two weeks of launch. I stopped playing and came back this March.Im not an Avengers fan but some of its members are some of my favorites like Hulk and Daredevil. If it wasnt for this game I wouldnt have given Warren Elliss run on Moon Knight a chance. I had to purchase MKs Marvel Now costume because of that. I also started reading GotG about a year ago because of RRs presence in this game. GotG is my favorite superhero film now. I dont even like the Fantastic Four but because I like playing Mr. F so much Ive read a few issues of FF.

That formula is good only if you value duplicate hero tokens at zero eternity splinters.  If you find value in ultimate upgrades then worst case scenario you will always get gt splinter value until such a time as you have enough maxxed out upgrades.I dont seem to have it anymore but somebody put up an excel file on google docs that allows you to put a  or a  for each hero to determine the effective value of a random box given as you suggest that the value of a box when you already have a hero is .

If you cant take the normal hits you might be underleveled? Leveling to the equal of the boss makes them more manageable. You can see enemy levels on the boss nameplates. Theres several ways to level safely for example in the Midtown challenge waypoint.Some characters have passive healing or health on hit but not all. The Lemuria relic and the teamup Magik are universal options although if youre a new player you may not have enough splinters to buy Magik or enough time to gather relics which randomly drop. Gear also has these stats health on hit health regen or health on kill but its usually the mainhand weapon.,marvelheroes,cjrjqpm,2,t5_2uhpg

You chose to use boosts on your own no one forced you. The boosts work the same as before just that the base drop rate has been reduced from obvious overtuned event. I didnt read anyone complaining the loot was too good when it occured so be grateful you had some playtime with extremely good loot. Btw I got  uniques within less than an hour of gameplay after the nerf so its not that bad of course nothing comparable to  unique per MM wave which is ridiculous but still much better than the usual drop rate which is the purpose of the event.

2040537,0,t3_2i5vs1,Well written I completely agree. So many valid points that you touch on there. I was banned for venting on their forums and criticizing the shop prices. Its all true though the prices are fucking absurd for what you get. But aye so long as Timmys parents pony up the dough and Gazillion is making sales it will never change.So far as the bugs go they drive me fucking crazy. People always spout oh they will be fixed soon and its not a huge problem anyway I can still play! Well OK son Im sure in your eyes Gazillion farts sherbet and shits rainbows. Truth is some bugs have been really game breaking for me and they have ruined what enjoyment I was having. To be fair though the bugs are fixed relatively quickly and for at least the last week or two it hasnt been too bad. The Rogue patch was a nightmare but I digress.The amount of creds I blow through is ludicrous agreed. Sometimes it feels like Im grinding for hours only to spin the wheel of fortune and end up with a bag of dicks after all my time spent. That is what makes games like this so good. Its like crack because when I DO get a good roll the endorphins kick in and I cant say a bad word about the game. At least for a few hours.A huge glaring issue that you brought up is being able to tell what the hell things do INGAME. For example team ups. No fucking stats AT ALL to go on just G and splinter prices. Really? Same goes with heroes. How am I supposed to know for example if Punisher is ranged melee or both before buying. Theres no way to tell other than to get out of the game and go look it up.All in all a great rant please keep it up. Hopefully the white knights dont get too salty about these types of posts.

2134516,0,t3_2jf4hz,Lord of the Rings Online LotRO has been doing events for quite some time and doing them well.  These events are seasonal Spring Summer Fall and Winter and their annual Anniversary event. Each of these events provide fun activities or quests that can be done and reset in different ways like the Hobbit or Dwarf Races the Beer Brawl the Winter Home Snowball fights and others that allow players to grind event currency for a myriad of cosmetic items including seasonal steeds and war horse items.  EDIT Also each time the event comes around there are some new fresh cosmetics to be acquired not just the same thing as last time although those are often available is well in case you missed it last time.The problem in my eyes with the implementation of the Marvel Heroes events is that there is always one rolling off and another rolling in.  Thats fine and I like that to an extent but what is the line from Syndrome in The Incredibles When everyone is super then no one will be or something like that.  And I think we can already see that happening to some degree.  After Odin or is it the Omega that has daily boost increments and Midtown events roll off when players come off of the much higher XP boosts to the lower boosts of the next event it seems like running in knee deep mud.Players have become accustomed to the higher XP gains and loot drops associated to the SIFRIF boosts that I think if Gaz ever went back to normal players would leave in droves.  Think about it if it took  hours to move  character to  and there are what  characters in game now thats alot of time.  Players would stick to  or  of their favorites and never deviate and there would be only a few best characters to play and no discovery of fun mechanics to other characters one might not play otherwise like Squirrel Girl not to mention killing viability of characters that dont seem to start coming in to their own till they get that one higher level skill.,marvelheroes,clb56rq,0,t5_2uhpg

The affixes are applied by your crafter with credits and crafting components which is one reason to level up your crafter early.  Cores are also applied by your crafter and require creditscomponents in addition to the core.Affixes have no minimum hero level requirement for any of the four tiers you can put them on a level  hero but each tier will roll better numbers than the previous tiers.  There are two types of affixes defensive and offensive which will roll defensive or offensive affixes.  On top of that when you do apply a costume core those affixes will scale up based on the level of that core.  A level  core will make your affixes much better.,marvelheroes,clzhehi,2,t5_2uhpg

The Cost to reroll will increase  Credits per level of your character when they reroll the quest. You want to focus on Terminal or Challenge Legendary Quests. They are the most of the time the faster ones to complete and give most xp per hour.When you complete the Legendary Quest lots of XP orbs and Odin marks will drop. Odin marks are the currency used to purchase Blessings At enchanter  think huge passive bonuses here and Legendary Items. Legendary Items are one of the key components of a characters item build. They give significant combat bonuses per Level of the legendary. They can be bought at the Legendary item Vendor in Odins Palace Chapter  on the NorthWest Side of the area.The story mode is primarily used for its bonuses on completing certain quests in certain chapters. Do not use this to level. It is incredibly slow and inefficient. This could change in the future but doubtful. Legendarys Quests LQs are considered the best way to level.

I then see that the game is super slow so I log out and let the antivirus finish. It had started between me waking up my computer and me logging in in the background.Dont make the assumption that I play under those circumstances just that it causes it due to my settings which were changed from  CPU down to  now in addition to changing it to an awakenedbut not used time schedule that its a I always play this game while Im virus scanning kind of thing.What I was pointing out is that its entirely possible OP is complaining about performance while something is downloading on the background or has some auto process like I also occasionally have my disk mirror process checking integrity of my raid array as well that affects his game.Maybe MH does not tell a computer that its using the CPU I mean my antivirus says it wont run if Im using the computer but it cannot stop once its started it seems.,marvelheroes,co8qof2,1,t5_2uhpg

3009679,0,t3_2un1bc,Heres a new tip thats never really said anywhere in game...There are times when for one reason or another you want to reset a private instance of the game.  Maybe its buggedstuck maybe you are doing Legendary Quests and dont want to hunt down a different Treasure Room etc.  There are actually several ways to force any private instances associated with your account to reset Change difficulty levels then change back.   Change characters then change back.   Get invited to a team however briefly.  You can generally ask in Social or LFG for someone to invite you very briefly.   Log out for  minutes.  The game does not release your private instances at once upon disconnect for the benefit of people who get involuntarily DCed but neither does it hold them for all that long.  Ive never figured out the exact amount of time but  minutes is definitely longer than the game will hold open your instances.Edit Oh and there are a few types of private instances that cannot be reset like this.  Generally ones that require you to consume an item to get into them.  There are not a lot of these and they are mostly level  content.  Cow portals and Doop portals are the ones that I am specifically thinking about.,marvelheroes,co9y8zl,2,t5_2uhpg

3160275,0,t1_copftg2,I took this from heregtLow FPS is a Computer ProblemgtLow frames per second FPS appear as your entire game behaving slowly. If your frame rate is low enough playing the game may feel like watching a slideshow as only a few different frames appear on your screen per second. In less extreme cases the game will feel jerky and slow  just the opposite of smooth.gtFrame rate issues arent caused by network problems. If you have a low frame rate thats not the game experiencing lag  thats your computer failing to keep up with the game. You may need a faster graphics card more RAM or a better CPU. Your hard drive may be too slow causing the game to slow down as its forced to read data from your hard drive. You may have too much junk software running in the background competing for resources.gtIn other words low FPS is a problem with the games performance on your computer. It doesnt have anything to do with your network connection.gtLag is a Network ProblemgtLag isnt a result of a problem with your computer its a result of a problem with your network. It may be a result of the games servers experiencing problems but its also likely that a network problem is occurring somewhere between your computer and the servers. If youre far away from the games servers  perhaps youre in Europe playing a game on North American servers  your latency often referred to as your ping time may be high. Learn more about latency here.gtLag shows up very differently from low FPS. If your game is lagging heavily your FPS may still be very high. If youre playing a multiplayer game the game may be completely smooth but other players may be stuck walking in place or teleporting around. When you shoot at someone in an online FPS you may always miss because your latency is so high that by the time your shot reaches their place theyve long since moved away. Actions you take in an online game may happen noticeably later  latency is the time it takes for your computer to communicate with the server.gtLag often refers to the delay caused by consistently high latency also referred to as high pings but you can also experience lag spikes where everyone else in the game appears to pause in place followed by their characters teleporting or racing to new locations as the game receives updates.gtLow FPS and Lag are Sometimes LinkedgtLow FPS and lag sometimes show up at the same time complicating things.  For example if youre playing a massively multiplayer online RPG MMORPG and your character is standing in a major city with hundreds of other characters running around on your screen you may experience both low FPS and lag. The lag occurs because the server is struggling to keep up and slowing down with so much happening in one place at once while the low FPS is a result of your computer struggling to draw all those characters on your screen at once.gtIn this case low FPS and lag have the same cause  more people than the game can handle in one place at the same time  which may confuse some gamers into thinking theyre the same thing. But theyre not  the large number of players is causing both performance problems on your computer low FPS and network issues lag.gtWhy You Should CaregtThis isnt just some abstract argument about kids these days using words wrong. If you understand the difference between lag and low FPS you can identify problems and have a better shot at fixing them.gtIf youre experiencing low FPS your computers hardware just cant keep up or you have too much junk software running in the background and you can fix it by upgrading your computers hardware or reducing the games graphical settings.gtIf youre experiencing lag thats a network problem. You may need to wait for the situation to improve switch to a closer server or fix problems on your local network.I hope this explains it well enough.  I know it sounds nitpicky but its difficult to discuss performance issues in games when not everyone is on the same page.  Id also like to add that I too have TONS of performance issues in this game even with a pretty beefy computer.  Its just poorly optimized and unfortunately all we can do while we wait for a fix is buy bettermore compatible components not an ideal solution but its the truth. But as Ive pointed out before as far as the network goes this game has been smoother than D for me.,marvelheroes,copk6zb,1,t5_2uhpg

Im almost positive that hes the lowest of the low in terms of DPS compared to the rest of the roster. Thats not to say you cant perform enough in a green raid to carry your own weight but it takes extra work in the form of gear. Ive yet to red raid with Deadpool and dont intend to until his rework but Id expect him to handicap your group and require some carrying in the DPS department.This is coming from someone whos moderately into Deadpool the character. Ive bought a few trades and have been reading the recent PosehnDuggan run though I still need to catch up on a few issues. I would recommend that unless you dig his dialogue and the novelty of his teleport power which several other characters also have might I add hold off on Deadpool until his  rework. Also I wouldnt hold my breath on that one either. Its in stone that his rework is to be the last. In July or August I think.EDIT Oh and I cant give you anything on Psylocke.

3769419,0,t1_cqlrk2s,I really hate that Cyclops gives that  boost.  Not because  bonus exp is bad it isnt obviously but because it makes him the goto hero for first timers.  I dont really like that as I feel everyone should be able to play whoever they want with no issue.  As it stands someone who wants to level all heroes but wants to start with anyone other than Cyclops is at a disadvantage.If you have a ton of time to play and you arent super neurotic about playing the most efficiently you can possibly play...then dont worry about it and just pick the hero you want to play.Youll start getting significant bonus exp as you level different heroes.  Each hero you level will add to your hero synergy bonus exp total.  This is a value from  representing a percentage.  Every hero you get to level  gives you  getting a hero to level  adds  and getting a hero to level  adds  for a total of  per hero.  The first four heroes you get to  add extra bonuses first hero   total second ups that  to  third ups  to  and fourth ups  to .  So by four heroes at  which isnt that hard youll be getting  bonus exp always.  Each hero after that is  total.Anyway personally I wouldnt worry too much about the exp bonuses.  There are constant bonus exp events bonus exp boosts are extremely common and leveling in this game is absurdly easy to begin with.  That being said Cyke is an exceptional hero.  He puts out huge damage numbers and major AoEs and buffs his teammates.  I consider Cyke one of my main heroes but that wasnt because of his exp bonus.,marvelheroes,cqlxw7v,2,t5_2uhpg

Very slow reviews for older characters and accelerating power creep are making it so you are almost forced to abandon those old characters for newer ones.  They should have just capped maximum damage output across the board so theirs a ceiling no matter who you play as.  I think this game should be about playing different heroes given the roster size.

3886357,0,t3_34xvzj,Correct me if Im wrong but something about this just doesnt seem right. They released Vision in an underpowered state to test him? Is that basically what they are saying? I thought that was what test center was for? Perhaps they should reward those who test a hero on the TC and give feedback that helps to improve said hero rather then releasing a broken one to the live server? Maybe a title or an achievement of sorts? Something small but enough to encourage people to try it out? If people arent testing these heroes and giving proscons regarding their kits then TC is obviously not working in its current iteration and needs to be changed.Basically what i got from this post is to never buy another hero on launch going forward because they arent going to be any good until a week after when theyre tuned correctly. This is a major issue for both the players and the development team. If people realize that heroes are gonna be garbage on release they whats the point of spending money on them til they are fixed? I havent bothered getting Vision yet for this exact reason. Fewer presales  bad for Gaz. Now before i get flamed Id like to explain myself. I know that balancing  heroes is gonna be hard for any game sure i understand that. Perhaps these heroes need more internal testing before being pushed out onto the live servers? Personally Id rather heroes take a longer time to come out but in a better state then having to wait for them to be any good.Just my thoughts.,marvelheroes,cqza14c,10,t5_2uhpg

Thematically this would work since spirit is basically your heroes ability to keep doing crazy things like dashing all over the place before they need to take a rest.

Id try going to trade chat and just posted WTS Liz for HPP and see what kind of responses you get.

In all three times it was Green Muspelheim and the people in the group who didnt know what they were doing were bad enough that the whole group failed.  You cant kill Hellfire and Brimstone if there are only  people in the group who have the buff.    For me three bad experiences was enough.  I also failed in the Axis raid but that was when it accidentally went live early and was so overtuned that no one who tried could get past the first sentinels.

4249262,0,t3_39lna2,Just finished my th red today still havent unlocked SheHulk so Im probably fit to answer this. Serverside boosts multiplying with clientside boosts is huge. Even if youre only running the  synergy and zero boosts you can get  in about hrm if youre on a hero who is fast at clearing terminal LQs during the insane  serverside days. It can take nearly twice as long on the slowest heroes. If youre willing to stack boosts you can break min on heroes like Nightcrawler or SS. First you need the credits to be able to reroll LQs then its all about fastanimation AoE and quick movement. For example even though Deadpool hasnt been reviewed and has low dmg hes still one of the fastest lvlers simply because he has an amazing AoE trashclearer Shoot All the Bullets and a zero cooldown TP.I made a guide for powerlvling but its a little outdated and Im too lazy to link it. If you have capped Omegas and plan on prestiging I recommend just using one set of  low level cosmics. The  to skills helps but in reality once you get good and know how to use things like Ringed Ruby of Raggador  lvl ish invul cores you can really get away with nothing but visual artifacts for hela blessings a legendary and a stack of Gib relics. A lvl ish Mole Man or Magneto medallion helps too but isnt mandatory. Just focus on spending as little time as possible messing around with skill points or gear and churn out LQs as fast as possible. Press L during the loading screen so the reroll screen is already up when you get back to Xaviers etc. All those seconds add up when doing speed runs.So to sum up it obviously depends on how much clientserverside boost is active then after that its a matter of which hero youre on how good you are with that hero and how efficient you are at clearing terminal LQs. My personal record is  minutes but Ive never bought boosts before so that was a rare run where I used a bunch of the freebies from events and had  clientside combined with close to  serverside. My standard run near the end of a juicy exp event is just over an hour when Im usually running  synergy plus the  you get from using a hr and hr boost you get from cube shards FCM.,marvelheroes,cs4lsui,7,t5_2uhpg

Dont believe me go through the AP fan poll and read how many entries are just a list of  mutants.Im pretty sure that if you put ANY mutant in here without another mutant to split the vote theyd be winning. That said people like Magik because shes hot and has a magic sword. Psylocke is also crazy popular. And when Magik gets in the game you can bet people will then start clamoring for Dazzler or Jubilee. I do think she deserves to be in the game. That being said were still missing some major characters from Marvel history like Beast Namor Angel Wasp Black Bolt Nick Fury all of whom Id consider bigger players in the universe than Magik. On the other hand a lot of people think Magik will have a cool playstyle so she may end up more fun to play than some of those I listed.,marvelheroes,cszb5le,14,t5_2uhpg

4699201,0,t3_3fapxd,there isnt much connection to wow other than a few devs being in wow top guilds and part of blizzard north.check the top bar new players readme choosing your next hero what to do when hitting .about large maps in mh check your mission log about what to do and use a movement power to scout the map once youre close to objectives they will appear on the map and indicators will show the way. i would recommend you to do story mode fully on your first char so you get to know it. it gives stats power points very important! you get them by killing hood kingpin clearing the shield laboratory and talking to heimdall some items credits and lots of xp! otherwise do legendary quests you can do them once you hit level .your crafter and enchanter are the closest to professions in wow but you only unlock recipes with them. first crafter then enchanter. some recipes are specific drops loki juggernaut or sold by vendors moondragon jocasta hogun madison jeffries.there are only three dailies in the game and if you do the genosha faction i believe you need a level  to unlock them youll get another daily and a weekly mission.your biggest gear upgrades are your own unique items with decent rolls and higher itemlevels  and  you increase them via recipes these will take a long time to obtain.for faster leveling you get xp synergy bonuses for every char at   and     your first four s grant you a large amount of xp i believe  or amp you can see that in your stats tab of any hero.also pvp is dead there are no mounts but pets and team ups to help you and to collect pirate deadpool team up is easy to get no expansions no monthly fee only one golditem selling website just report and ignore the account. the only greenskin here is no shaman and people respect him. no mounts yet? but many heroes have travel powers like cyclops bike.oh and press tab while on a map it shows you a bigger overlay map which helps with finding your points of interest. and maps arent static they change and you can have different instances for instance with two out of four possible treasure rooms and you have to be patient if you want to get a map with other than the current treasure room or switch heroes which you cant because you have only one.also try some builds since respeccing is free,marvelheroes,ctmvgfo,3,t5_2uhpg

A more complex option is to run Xen or some other hypervisor with a virtualized Windows machine installed on your linux box.  Xenserver would be a good choice as it has GPU passthrough baked in.

The enchants are good for all heroes but are a one time buy.So whats the difference? That you dont really play the heroes that benefit from Cosmic Worldstones but you do play heroes that benefit from Armor drives?Also power doop runeword is BiS on all hybrids and on many high critbrut  phys dmg heroes.

6020979,0,t3_3xttxi, Bug fixes longer test cycles.   Non damage dealer heroes need to be more effective.  Tanks need to have better crowd control and utility characters to have more options to help teammates change existing character abilities test before release.   Less items dropped better items dropped.  I know Gaz sells inventory space but I want to play a heroic action game not an inventory management simulation.  Affordable bundles.  I know Gaz needs to make money but it should not take s of dollars to buy all of the heroes in the game.  There should be an affordable bundle for each year of development.   Story mode should be optional.  Quests should not reward eternity splinters or spirit.  Eternity splinter drop rate should be increased and spirit per level should be increased to compensate.  The story mode quest rewards should be a cosmic item and a chance for an artifact ring or emblem of the heros level.  The first time you kill an act ending boss it should drop a unique of your level up to a maximum set by the quest.  This way you still get cool loot from story mode but you dont feel you must play it.   Danger Room Holo Sim XMansion defense Midtown Madness and Industry City should be playable and scale for all levels.  If you really like one of these mods you aught to be able to sit in it for hours and level away.   Relics should be removed from the game.  Enchantments should be removed from the game.  Costume affixes but not cores should be removed from the game.  Uru should be removed from the game.  Again I want to play a heroic action game not a crafting game.  Hulk doesnt care if he has a shirt or shoes on let alone about all of the stuff above.   Pets should either be cosmetic or more easily earned.  Right now they give substantial stat boosts and their availability varies.  Maybe a pet should be awarded the first time you level a character to ?  Story mode quest objectives should respawn very quickly.       Quests should trigger when you first enter an act.  That way if you know the quest objectives you can do them as you encounter them not have to backtrack to earn progress on your quest.  ,marvelheroes,cy8vhcx,1,t5_2uhpg

6084880,0,t1_cyh1j51,Generally people dont like Vision for a couple of reasons. First being that his major single target damage dealer TriBeam is a Solar Energy hog. Something to the tune of  solar energy per second. If you dont know what you are doing youll use TriBeam for  seconds and then just kinda have to sit around doing nothing until it regenerates. There are ways to adequately manage Solar Energy on Vision to make it so you have maximum TriBeam uptime but most people dont care to try to make it work when you can just go cheese around on Doctor Doom or Magik. Second his robot pet doesnt get very many tricks doesnt do damage and is underwhelming in terms of what people wanted. Though I contend that its actually pretty useful if you consider what it brings to the table. You need to find yourself an enemy with Commanding Aura and itll jack up your attack speed by something like  hey  bonus damage to TriBeam just for having the robot engage!. The robot is also great at dividing enemy attention. Itll never really die unless you explode it yourself so it can really take some heat for you at critical times. If robot friend manages to take villain aggro you just get to tee off and TriBeam him to East Jesus.Third I guess people dont care to do the proper rotation and admittedly they just nerfed one of the best parts. I dont exactly know when it happened but sometime in the past month they got rid of another important aspect of Channeled Solar Beam. It used to have the additional effect enemies struck by Channeled Solar Beam take  more damage from your Solar powers but they took it out. Prior to this change you would rotate Surface of the Sun enemies take  damage Solar Flare for the k damage rating increase and then hit a boss with a half second of Channeled Solar Beam. So now you are fully ready to smash this nerd but again the problem comes when by this point you might be out of Solar Energy to make TriBeam last longer than  seconds. Theres where people just need practice. People also overlook the fact that you get a free medkit power in Healing Nanites! At level  what mine happens to be at you get  health back instantly and another  over  seconds. Combine this with a  medkitinvulnerable core and youll have pretty good longevity.But mostly making Vision good comes down to use of TriBeam. Mine does k damage four times per second. The exact same skill on Cyclops Focused Beam at level  does k four times per second and my Cyclops is no slouch. Both of them are properly geared and item level . I routinely get sub s TTK. Exact number varies depending on if Solar Overcharge and Terminal Velocity brutal. Hes the one hero who I always go to when I need to be both effective at killing TriBeam will decimate your foes and effective at survival Healing Nanites the ability to teleport without resource use a pet distraction and a health pool that has almost naturally made its way north of k.,marvelheroes,cyh7hjw,5,t5_2uhpg

6427330,0,t3_43ivof,I think getting someone you like is very important. I started with captain America who I enjoyed getting to . Now Im on Doom who I have really grown to enjoy in the game. Another thing to consider is a team up also. Theyre is a free shield agent team up that I just learned about.  Think its in chapter  but maybe look that up. Not sure who is cheap for team ups but I started with groot. He was cheap on Splinters. Hes a tank and helps when grindingleveling. Although they didnt have the free shield agent team up at the time. If I did it again Id get the freebie and use the free splinters on another character like the others are saying. One final advice. At least log in EVERY day.. You get daily rewards everyday but you gotta log in to get them. ,marvelheroes,czk4gmz,1,t5_2uhpg

6428781,0,t3_43qhjb,Scarlet Witch is popular but otherwise really meets all of your requirements. Likewise Jean Grey she has more build diversity but specializing in either Energy or Mental simplifies her quite a bit.Cyclops is conceptually easy uses a single bar and has no real build diversity. Hes popular as a first character because of the  experience from his synergy but hes not particularly fantastic endgame so hes not seen all that much in spite of that. Hes also not very visually impressive.Iron Man amp War Machine are both primarily ranged characters that are relatively mobile. Black Widow also falls into this category.Ghost Rider meets most of your requirements I think. Visually appealing depends on your tastes and hes sort of hybrid melee but even his melee abilities are largely at range. Thor is also sort of hybrid melee but I play a mostlyranged spec which feels and looks pretty good and is fine in endgame content.TLDR Id recommend Scarlet Witch or Jean despite their popularity. Scarlet Witch especially is very very easy to play and would be a good intro to the game and its mechanics if you dont want to be overwhelmed and because spirit issues with her are virtually nonexistent she has no particularly difficult gearing requirements that would prevent you from moving onto endgame content.,marvelheroes,czk9vdj,3,t5_2uhpg

6513532,0,t1_czsa49a,No one wants to figure it out for themselves but they think they know for sure how it works. Oh well. I was confused about this for a long time but thats why I started recording drop times. Without extra SIF there is definitely a noticeable difference in the quickness of how fast your next drop is after the  minutes is up. My fastest splinter drop was  while running about  sif from event bonuses and boosts. With my unbuffed  sif its usually more like  minutes or so but it can take up to  minutes sometimes. And sometimes it drops right after the  minute timer is up. My sample size was about  splinters before I stopped writing it down. If Im running a splinter boost and want to make the most of it I still use a timer then afk in a hub between drops and always make sure I have at least  SIF. You can get by with less than that but it helps get the bigger multidrops and you only have to spend about  seconds in midtown before you get your drop. ,marvelheroes,czt1t8e,2,t5_2uhpg

I considered myself a venom main for a long time but honestly juggernauts survivability  ease of use made him my go to champ when farming terminals or doing CMM.  All of his own uniques are good slot  has multiple options depending on what you need. His artifacts are low cost if you need to trade for them and basically the game has a ton of options for physical damage  stats he loves. He does decent damage and the hardest thing about him is getting use to controlling his sig.  he is the perfect put Netflix on one screen and play marvel on the other screen.  All of the other heroes have issues with either survivability or specific damage layer requirements sometimes both.

I think the math on this doesnt work because while percentages are percentages the more loot that drops the more chances you have at a low percentage drop. They effectively cut the loot drops by half or more on cosmic patrol areas and in order to compensate for the drastic decrease in opportunities the percentage chance would have to be increased exponentially to offset this effect. Knowing devs they probably raised the percentage without working out the overall math.

7393883,0,t3_4gkvhe,Congrats on getting your first  and welcome to the game!I want to second  Mark of the Odinborn an arti that can drop anywhere Godkiller Legendary which drops in High Town Get a pet pets dont bind to heroes so you can swap them freely to new heroes Get a teamup along with pets can make decent difference in both dps and survivability early game.Beyond that heres my tips Dont underestimate the use of the gearweapons vendors. I always have my autovacuum set to leave only uniques or cosmic and uniques so I tend to play heroes naked until about  or  when I buy gear from both vendors.  The bonus power ranks you can get at that point make a big difference in your damage and survivability. Pay attention to which story missions give useful rewards. For instance for melee heroes I always go through the mission in lowtown to recover the masamune pieces. It gives you a decent lowlevel artifact. For ranged I go to the shield hideout in lowtown to get the artifact from that mission.These last two arent gear stuff but can be a huge help to new folks who are leveling Pay attention to events. Midtown Monday is GREAT for leveling. Omega Week next week I believe is fantastic for leveling towards the end because it gives a huge boost. Make sure you pay attention and stay within the appropriate level range for story mode. Its easy to be underleveled for a given area and then you dont get almost any experience from enemies and rewards. So use other modeslegendary quests to fill in the space so you can maximize story xp rewards.,marvelheroes,d2imvzh,2,t5_2uhpg

The thing is though Black Widow and the Hulks relationship had no buildup  like at all. No real payout  no real point. And they referenced the  Hulk movie in the first Avengers  now suddenly Hulks moving on without tying up the loose end that was his relationship in that movie? And Black Widow is MORE than her vagina  or her ability to have children unfortunately in the AOU thats all that it felt like they were doing with her character.And as for Hawkeye... uh... in what universe? In the  the ONLY time he was married or had a family was with Bobbi and we all know how THAT ended. The ONLY universe that I know of that has him with a wife and kids would be the Ultimate universe and THEY were all slaughtered... like... badly. I wasnt aware the MCU was based on the Ultimate Comics  especially since they seem to be mostly doing their own version of the  especially the latest movie along with their own plotlines. It doesnt make sense in my mind for someone in a highrisk job and lifestyle like Hawkeye to risk civilians like that. Especially not to marry said civilians and make LITTLE civilians. It would be EXTREMELY irresponsible  and it was even shown in the ultimate comics HOW irresponsible it was when they... ya know...

7840255,0,t3_4mpmjo,Im going on very little sleep here from farming but Ill give it a shot. Once you feel up  Odin marks you can but an item grade  legendary item from a vendor in Asgard. This item has no stats at base but you gain stats as the it levels up. They can get up to level .  Item grade  legendaries are equip able by a level  hero but keep in mind that if you switch your legendary from hero to hero you will lose all the xp youve gained on it. You can also trade in your grade  legendary for  odin marks at any time so it is s risk free investment. Item grade  legendaries are a better version of the grade  legendaries however they cost  odin marks and can only be traded back in for  so make sure the legendary you buy will work for your most played heroes. Also right now they year  cake from the event vendor in Avengers tower is guaranteed to have a grade  legendary in it and are by far the best game from the event vendor other than the herostash etc. as you can still sell them for  marks to using on blessings or whatever!As far as releveling your hero to  that is called prestiging.  Your name in game starts out as the white color and as you prestige youre hero that name changes color. It goes from white to green and on up through bluepurplered etc and then there is finally cosmic prestige. Cosmic prestige is the last time you can reset your hero and relevel them and it makes your name yellow like cosmic items in game. Cosmic prestige also take  times the normal amount of xp to level not including special events. Id recommend it only for the hardcore of the hardcore fans of a heroHope that answers most of your questions are sorry for any typos or spelling errors as Ive had about  hours of sleep and Im on mobile typing this in the dark while using my phone as a flashlight.  ,marvelheroes,d3xb9l5,19,t5_2uhpg

Additionally after your first playthrough you just wanna stick to main story questsand powerspirithealth sidequests and fill the level gaps doing legendariespatrols where you get a sweet and juicy event xp boosts.

8109434,0,t3_4qaw6e,Going to echo Deadpool  Doom or a  splinter in general as your first free unlock. Deadpool is a resourceless hero with a solid ranged and melee build and is pretty good. Dooms most popularconsidered best build is summoning minions if throwing bunches of bots at people sounds good hes a great choice  but he also has a solid caster path and a decent melee physical path making him a decent first choice for variety. They both have resourceless teleports which make getting around a breeze.Rogue certainly wins on the variety path by a long shot and shes good but personally I think she requires a bit much info diving to make builds for for a new player. Spiderman is a solid firstoption as well from what Ive seen but I dont have any hands on experience with him and am personally just not a spidey fan.For your splinters later on Scarlet Witch is a very strong caster choice in the  bracket. Daredevil is also very good at  but a number of people arent a huge fan of his aesthetic.Most heroes are pretty playable the few I would avoid are probably Wolverine Cable pretty good post but a very unpleasant leveling experience for a new player prior imo and Hawkeye.,marvelheroes,d4rknbd,4,t5_2uhpg

8356408,0,t1_d5m0hzw,To elaborate people were making off the books trades  trading G shop items for ingame items e.g. artifacts on dummy accounts and then doing chargebacks on the G shop items. There are indeed no CONVENTIONAL ways to stop this while G shop gifting remains intact. Unconventional ways would include disabling all trading of nonG shop items or enabling trading only after X number of hours played on the G shop account.  So the devs are probably weighing right now how important gifting is as compared to trading. Personally Id be really happy if trading disappeared and drop rates were drastically buffed but the whales hold the purse strings and Id be surprised if trading wasnt here to stay permanently. ,marvelheroes,d5m3qjy,7,t5_2uhpg

If you cant get the ICP ring at least try to get a demonband with energy andor fighting on it because IW dont need int.Put on a runeword. Any runeword is better than no runeword and you can always overwrite it with GoM later. Although you will find enough Uruforged in cosmic patrols anyways.Get rid of the Zigg and use AMA Advanced Metasensory Array which is quite good when you dont have all your skills maxed and its pretty easy to get as well. Also with your current gear I think you could use the attack speed.Use Slice of Pizza and Mug of Grog if you have them and also craft potions to use and buy the damage potions from the cube shard vendor.Dont dodge too much because more dodging  less damage. If you can take the hits then do so or use your medkits often. You can also try to position your teamup between yourself and the boss so your teamup gets hit instead of you.You might want to try Crashing Wave Style instead of Crushing Force because its a higher single target damage ability and if youre having problems with the boss then it would probably help with that. The only disadvantage with it is that you can no longer gear purely for area damage like with the build I think youre using.For omega points I think youre better off maxing out SPIN tech and then put the rest of the points into Warpath and then maybe Sunfire if you have any points left over both in Mutation.Good luck.,marvelheroes,d6na9hn,14,t5_2uhpg

9042496,0,t1_d7ypznm,I think the controller friendly power rework has more to do with them adding controller support for the PC.  The main problem with the current PC controller support is exactly what others are talking about in this thread controlling AoE sticky targeting and the like.  They just hired a bunch of people to work on marvel heroes and no one has leaked any info on any form of console specialty positions that were filled.  Programming a game for PC compared to console is not something you can expect the existing employees to manage.  But who knows maybe they did hire people to work on a console port and just nobody has leaked anything anywhere about it......  nah.On top of that even assuming its a monthly update for console every console update costs  beyond the typical programming time and such of a PC update.  Xbox and PS both charge the companies for each update they release to the game.  With how buggy the PC patches are the console patches will be equally as buggy thus hotfixes or pissed off players for a month.  Bad business all around.With all the additional costs and hardships I dont think a console port would help Gazillion in the slightest.  Also I dont know a single console gamer that doesnt have a computer and a controller for gaming as well.  I dont see the point or the intelligence in expecting a person to drop  to play a game on a console that they can play on PC for free unless that  bucks gets them free access to all heroes.  At which point the free to play PC crowd is going to get pissed for not having the option to pay the same price for access to all heroes.All I see is drama loss of revenue and loss of quality all around.  It would be a poor business decision.And all that is besides the point that the vast majority of console players are little rage machines and that is the last thing this community needs is more rage machines.,marvelheroes,d7yrhsc,0,t5_2uhpg

9497089,0,t1_d9jowm1,If you enjoy the game there is no reason to wait for update. We dont really know when the updates will go live. The testing of first updatehero power update should start very soon but considering the size it may take long weeks before it hits live servers. And it will  take few months till all the big updates are released. So it could be a really long wait. The only thing that is not worth doing in game right now is trying to minmax your slot  unique gear or farm for upgrade recipies as those will be replaced with new omega gear. You still will be able to use those uniquesthey just will stop dropping after update which should make farming for new Omega gear easier. So getting a set of level  uniques for your heroes is not a bad idea especially that it doesnt take long. Everything other in game if it comes to itemization  will stay the samefor the most part. There will be only some stat changes on gear that currently grants bonuses to powers so it may change what items are best in slot. So you can still collect artifacts rings amulets farm odin marks for Legendary itemsblessings relics etc. Credit chest recipies are going away so it may be a good idea to stock pile on them as well.You can also participate in the events like current Dr Strange event that even has some items already taylored for upcoming itemisation update. ,marvelheroes,d9jpvek,4,t5_2uhpg

9575707,0,t3_5c2p5v,gtIf they want to encourage clearing whole maps instead of skipping straight to boss fights they dont need to nerf travel powers. They should consider increasing the EXP and good loot we get from trash mobs. If grinding trash mobs was as much Exp Per Minute as zooming to bosses Id go back to playing that way and enjoy it. I feel like developers often lose sight of this.  If you give the players incentives to just play the game most of them will just play the game.  Its when you create specific incentives to do particular content that farming enters the metagame and ingame trade begins to be conducted via tradeable items instead of ingame currency.  It happens everywhere  look at Diablo .  Look at Borderlands.  Look at Path of Exile.I totally see their point with dashes.  Whether you think the Cosmic Trial is hard or not comes entirely down to the question of whether you dash in combat a lot or you try and stand there and scrap  if you dash its easy if you scrap its a big ole gear check.  Thats not great for the future of balance and character design and I dont blame them for wanting to correct it.  But I think their concerns over travel power have a lot more to do with the reward system in place and less with players trying to farm content faster.,marvelheroes,d9tegnn,3,t5_2uhpg

The issue was that players didnt get the item they were farming for and assumed the boosts werent working rather than having a basic understanding of RNG and odds of winning.I honestly dont understand what the issue is or why RIFSIF boosts are being brought up again other than to complain they arent being converted to the new BIF system.,marvelheroes,da23bqn,2,t5_2uhpg

9862282,0,t1_dat2hc8,gtBut you can be more specific so that it is less of an issue. I.e. Hulk CAN be allowed to be high damage.. but his high damage is going to be melee and single target and slow i.e. VERY bursty versus Cyclops ranged AoE high and constant DPS which makes him a much better damagedealer overall. Maaaybe. Im skeptical of the ability to balance out a character that can outtank and DPSblast a boss mob verses one that can AoE street sweep trash mobs but is basically helpless against bosses. I proposed an idea a few days back to balance these on the basis of how loot is generated but I think actually balancing them on combat strength would be hard to manage. I agree with everything you say about Hulk if he never had to be balanced against other heroes but in a game where Black Widow should technically be equal to him overall I just dont see it working out that way. Hulk can smash he just cant survive being smashed as well as one would expect. As for Cyclops he should really have a move like D.Vas in Overwatch an active projectile denial move that makes him effectively immune to range in short bursts blasting stuff out of the air. when people try to melee him ideally he could rely on pushback but given the balance issues that could cause if he could pingpong any enemy at will hed have to settle for avoidance dodge rolls mostly. He can also apply passive debuffs like Weakness so that if they do hit him they arent at their best. And of course at the end of the day he still needs to be tougher than is strictly fair about  as tough as Colossus when he really should be like . as tough.Heroes are of course much easier to balance if you only consider  v  fights but in practical terms you need to balance them when you have ten players verses six bosses all using their abilities and no one of them can be allowed to completely dominate the opponent. gtIts not dissimilar to how a barbarian vs how a wizard plays in D. The Wizard stays alive primarily but doing shittons of dmg and just not getting hit by shit to begin with. They oblierate stuff with disintegration beam optic blasts before they ever get touched. Same with Cyclops and his optic blasts.I dont play D but according to the Wiki the Wizard does have a teleport and armor spells to protect himself too. Not sure how much difference that might make. ,marvelheroes,dat2tx1,1,t5_2uhpg

9913257,0,t1_dazpagw,Spamming Lariat would be fine but cant work because of dash charges. In theory they could fix this by giving him a Basic that works the way Novas Cosmic Combo does on Live where the attack animation carries him through the mob giving the appearance of zipping back and forth though slower for Jugg than Nova  except that animation caused all sorts of camera issues.He needs a new mechanic in order to work the way he should in combat. I think the best way to do that would be to make Stride have no windup when used with zero Momentum andor refill all Lariat charges when BED is used. Theres got to be some way to preserve his feel while still achieving the goals of the rework.EDIT Maybe they could give Lariat four charges BED refills all charges each use of Lariat adds  Momentum? I know most everyone prefers Stride to Lariat but maybe the momentum buff would fix that. Or they could just have a Talent  one is this Lariat fix one is so Stride has no windup when Momentum is empty and the other is for the people who want a nonMove melee build?,marvelheroes,dazpykw,2,t5_2uhpg

9943774,0,t1_db3m49q,The speed used to be much slower for peoples normal travel power. It originally started at  I believe. Then you could boost it with move speed to around . Then people complained that teleporters were so much faster than nonteleporters so they upped the travel speed to  which was not affected by move speed. Now they are making all dash powers and teleport powers travel the same distance with a limit to how much you can use them to equalize the teleporters and nonteleporters. They are setting the base travel power speed to  for the travel power that is separate from the dashteleport powers. Basically they are putting it back where it was. It will be slower but after a week of playing with it slower I doubt itll be all that noticeable while you are traveling around. The thing that will be noticeable is the  second charge up time for the dedicated travel power that is currently on test center. Slower speed will also make it a lot easier to turn and move while using the travel powers so there should be fewer instances where people get stuck because they were going too fast to avoid objects with the wonky steering at higher speeds.Yeah those things you mention hating in the story are the things they are changing. Have you noticed how much more streamlined chapter  is compared to say chapters  through ? It is more go a linear route and less about finding random things on a huge map that someone else might have already killed. There is only one time where you are killing things with other people around in chapter  and thats the endlessly respawning symbiotes in the church. That is the way they are slowly changing each chapter of the story. They have only updated the prologue and chapter  at this point. They will release chapters  and  with the big system overhaul. And then the rest of them will get an update some time after that. It should be less of a wait since they wont have the huge update to take up most of their time.,marvelheroes,db3p52d,1,t5_2uhpg

10236469,0,t1_dc42mu5,Theres also the Pirate Deadpool one but you only get that at a higher level and you have to have a character that can emote listen not all of them can. Its an achievement reward and theres several guides for it. Out of the free ones ie not costing money or splinters its probably the most useful.Then theres Agent Coulson but that will need several farming sessions whenever the Omega event is on to gather the currency to unlock him.Finally theres the HoloWolverine one which you can farm specific currency for by completing Danger Room Scenarios.The rest are either splinter ones login rewards XForce Wolverine at day  Holiday Groot at Christmas and various others that arent a solid guarantee as to when theyre available like Dr Doom seasonal ones only available for Gs at a limited time Brood Wolverine CW Variants etc Fortune Card unlocks and an achievement variant. Variants have the same utility but different flavour for example Deadpool Kid and Pirate Deadpool have the same abilities but differently named and animated. If you see two versions of the same character as teamups rule of thumb is If one says something in parentheses next to their name the case is as stated above. If not it may have slightly but not wholly different abilities.,marvelheroes,dc4d058,1,t5_2uhpg

10434300,0,t1_dcqipvx,Its not an eitheror...its not like either Omega was perfect or Infinity is.  Omega had a lot of issues but it was still deeper than Infinity is and I think thats a greater sin of design.Could you just plug everything into Warpath?  Sure and that was effective up to a point.  But it wasnt fully optimal.  And the mantra of offense is everything was never fully true  there were utility nodes like the spirit return in Cosmic for nonphysical heroes that were equally important as pure damage nodes.  Defense nodes were useful for a lot of heroes that didnt have a lot of TTL in their toolkit even if people didnt actually use them and then just complained about having to zerg.  Plus even among the DPS nodes there were situationalproc nodes that lent themselves to personalization more than the flat universal bonuses we have throughout Infinity.You dont have to say that Omega was total perfection just because you dont like Infinity.  But I think Omega was a lot closer to the right answer than Infinity is.  Id rather have complexity with some issues than a system thats just too oversimplified to have anything go wrong.,marvelheroes,dcqsq5w,1,t5_2uhpg

I think each one holds  items.Other than that you will earn eternity splinters which you can use to unlock playable heroes and teamups. Some pets are also earnable i think one is available for splinters.  Heroes are     splinters depending on popularity and development cost to put them in the game.  The  is for a random hero box when you first start out this is the cheapest way to unlock heroes but you get no choice in what you get.  There are some achievements that reward teamups i think there are a couple costumes as well I dont remember if there are any pets via achievements or not.Costumes are pretty much for  so if you want your playable to have different threads youll need to pony up some cash.

This is especially true in a Marvel based game like this because a lot of people tend to play characters they like in terms of design or lore.,marvelheroes,desqkt7,1,t5_2uhpg
11136174,0,t1_deu8tv6,somewhat. No exchange option in crafter anymore and a bunch of heroes got stat changes that made some gear perks not useful to them. Also the new gear tier is going to replace a bunch of gear. Some of the uniques are still useful but youre gonna have to spend a lot of time sorting thru them depending on who you are trying to gear. Gazillion is getting rid of them in the future which is why they did those events to help people farm them for achievements a while back. Problem is that this BUE is split up and going to take who knows how long to fully implement that your guess is as good as mine as to when they will be fully phased out,marvelheroes,deu9vv5,2,t5_2uhpg

11435544,0,t3_637cw6,Some of this is definitely correct and needs work. But Eternity Splinters are pretty easy to come by and getting a new hero in this game is not the same as getting a hero in a Moba. As for price points its almost exactly the same if not cheaper than League of Legends. A new hero is basically a new version of the game. On top of that they give away so many free heroes theres really nothing to complain about. Hard to disagree with your other comments tho. Still enjoy the game here and there but yeah. ,marvelheroes,dfs7hgk,0,t5_2uhpg

Yes the ps will make more money on release and for a while after but say a year later i expect both to be similar in terms of revenue.

11653637,0,t3_66ab0j,Ive played a lot of D and recently started playing MH. I enjoy Marvel Heroes quite a bit but I doubt Im leaving D for it. I will probably play MH for a bit until I get bored then play D until I get bored again and repeat. General differences that favor D   D feels faster. In D I would sprint through rifts as fast as I could go killing anything in my way. In MH movement abilities have restrictions and enemies have enough health that youre never going to mow down bosses.   MH has worse item management. In addition to gear there are lots of crafting materials and other things you will want to keep. Unfortunately you cant expand your stash beyond two tabs without spending money. On top of that you have one main inventory that you keep even when you change heroes so muling is out of the question.   There are lots of heroes but theyre hard to acquire rapidly without spending money and the primary way to get new ones without spending money is a random draw that isnt guaranteed to give you something new. Spending a week farming shards for a random new hero is frustrating when you get your third copy of a guy you dont even like. Differences that favor MH   Lots of heroes with different play styles. Ive played about  guys so far and theyve all felt different. Some have been close but even then there are nuances that make one hero feel different from another.   A generally happy theme. I know some people dont care but diablo has a general Woe is me. Were all doomed theme going that doesnt really appeal to me. Sometimes its nice to play the game in some sunlight.   Easy and lazy grouping. Much of the game is done solo but in a couple of areas youll need more people. Conveniently enough those areas tend to just have people doing the same thing as you so you dont need to coordinate it just happens.   Jokes. Again not a huge thing but appreciated.  Regarding your comment that MH is an MMO with Diabloesque gameplay Id say it has very few MMO elements to it. There are two raid zones three if you count the second difficulty on one raid but from what I understand theyre not a big part of the game. Other than that its not very MMOish.  tldr  its a good game for when you need a break from Diablo but you probably wont get lost in it for a decade the way people do with some games. ,marvelheroes,dggyd28,13,t5_2uhpg

What is odd about that is the May th is a Tuesday when an expected end date for the raffle would be on a Friday.  Source  However dont expect for them to just switch off the servers and back on and BOOM open beta. They are going to do a character wipe deploy a new build etc. I would estimate servers to be back up around the thth for people to play over the weekend.  ,marvelheroes,dgqlpp7,5,t5_2uhpg
