6640068,0,t1_d064c9h,Personally I think whale is testing confidence. Trying to wring out any last loose Moneros. Better to push any quick profit traders out now to strengthen this level and so they cant dump us when we go up again. It seems pretty unshakeable. If I had extra btc I would likely add to my stack here too.,moneromarkets,d0652iu,3,t5_37za8
6726993,0,t1_d0f4d9y,Ugh fine Ill modify the code over the weekend to change it to autobuying. Might as well put my talents to use. Side note Ive been considering taking a look at modifying the Trezor code to support Monero. I havent decided whether to pull the trigger and do it or not but I do have some experience in embedded systems code. Unfortunately Im a bit light on the actual cryptographic implementations but that just takes some research. Though this endeavor could be a bit more of an undertaking than Im expecting.,moneromarkets,d0f4okc,1,t5_37za8

7931093,0,t3_4nsu3d,Strong hands here I think Monero will at least keep pace with Bitcoin as it rises maybe with a bit of lag but I dont care.,moneromarkets,d47j2vt,3,t5_37za8
8258864,0,t3_4sbjmo,Whoever made this has admirable design skills.Wouldnt those skills be better spent on a GUI?If Monero had a GUI that looked this slick it would be miles ahead of any other currency in terms of user experience.Frankly one of the main benefits of cryptocurrencies is separation from political processes.  Explicitly injecting political processes into a cryptocurrency is like deliberately introducing a bug into the software...The Ethereum governance process very recently came to the conclusion to implement a balancereassigning historyrewriting hard fork.I would be mortified if this happened to Monero.Unfortunately no matter how many wellintentioned assurances are made simply having this sort of process increases the risk of an Ethereumstyle balanceseizing hardfork in the far future.Let me be blunt the more support I see for this sort of governance thing from the Monero community the less valuable I believe XMR to be and will trade accordingly.  It always starts out great and always ends in depravity.Power corrupts.,moneromarkets,d59wyi0,1,t5_37za8
