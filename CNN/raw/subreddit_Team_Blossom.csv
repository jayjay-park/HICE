11232849,0,t1_df3dcbd,This is awesome! Ive gotten addicted to podcasts lately. Just started a good crimedocumentary type one called Up and Vanished its on Spotify. Only letting myself listen to it during outdoor walks as an extra motivation. Will be adding some of these to my line up for sure ,Team_Blossom,df58898,2,t5_3jkfk
11267996,0,t3_60trn2,All of the running! I finished ck a few weeks ago and am now running every other day working on distance now rather than time! Major workout victory for me is that Im away for the weekend and Im taking my running gear so I dont miss my Saturday morning run! ,Team_Blossom,df97lcx,9,t5_3jkfk

11321051,0,t3_61eqa4,I incorporated walking on foot to office in my daily regimen. It gives me . km of brisk walking daily and honestly when I started I thought Ill bail because I was too winded first two days. But I kept at it.And I stuck to my daily semi strength semi aerobic workouts which still kills me every day. And I still suck at them. But I decided to do them anyways to the best of my ability and see what happens. ,Team_Blossom,dff80b2,3,t5_3jkfk
11372301,0,t3_625jqr,nd day of nd week of working out done! Only just realized that I can make boring cardio time faster by watching YouTube.  Those  minutes went by so fast I almost did an extra  by accident. Also have to replace the squats I cant do on Friday with my rehab exercises for my knee flexibility. Its seiza or nothing!  ,Team_Blossom,dfl1259,2,t5_3jkfk

This was a good thing because I wanted to eat a bigger dinner on Tuesday and I wasnt as active as I usually am on Thursday Heyo Blossoms awesome job this past week! I remembered to enter in all of my steps and workout minutes last night. Its been fun participating in the fitbit  weekday step challenge I didnt even realise I was walking so much!  steps in  days averages out to k steps per day. Knowing that just makes me want to round up the number Im aiming for  steps next week! An extra walk here and there maybe during a work break would do me some good.Anyway I lost .lbs again this week. Im thrilled that Im logging my food correctly even when Ive been estimating and its showing on the scale. I weighed in at .lbs offically but then I took a second bathroom break and wouldnt you guess the scale said lbs flat. Im chalking it up to fluctuations and also it being the first day of my period would make things wonky? Right? Sureeee. If its not a misread? Well next weeks weigh in will be sweeeeeet.,Team_Blossom,dfz412s,2,t5_3jkfk

11763191,0,t3_67ugn3,First my new fave snack split a banana in half spread PB on it using just enough water or almond milk to make it spreadable then sprinkle on your fave granola. Freeze for  minutes. Great pickmeup in the afternoon for me.Second I made a variation of this chicken thigh one pan meal but I made a few substitutions including adding bell peppersred onionbroccoli to add veg and sweet potatoes instead of new potatoes.  Also added stone ground mustard to the sauce.  Came out wonderful.,Team_Blossom,dgtdxxt,4,t5_3jkfk
