321286,0,t3_1xqxe5,Lets see what light I can shed on the game...After . Bc you should really play d at some point. Otherwise your light square bishop is going to become a target for blacks queenside advances. If you were aiming for a closed sicilian the bishop belongs on g where is helps protect your king after the advance of the pawns there and is not a target as in the game. If you were aiming for the open sicilian this transposes to the dragon where the bishop belongs on c.. Ng is hope chess. Its just a waste of a tempo after ...e. . Qf runs into Qxg. Speaking of Qxg your opponent missed his chance for a free knight after . Re Qxg. I think hope? you may have entered the move order wrong here....Ne gives you the chance to correct your initial mistake of putting the bishop on c with . Bf. The knight on g is untouchable because if ...Qxg . d gives white back the piece with a good position. . a is poorly timed. You have a slight initiative the advanced knight on g along with your lead in development makes an attack easy and more or less give it away with this move. Play where you have space! . f on the other hand is exactly what you should be looking for after playing f. ...exf . Nxf wins material and ...gxf . Qh is also good for white. The best continuation for black is probably ...h . fxe! hxg . exf Kf . Bxg when you have  pawns for the piece and blacks king has the potential to be very weak. After . Ba your bishop is doing almost nothing. Id consider Bxd as at least that way you have the potential to get the f break working for counterplay. Otherwise you should just get crushed. The exchange sac after . Ne is totally justified in my opinion. Black loosens his king and has no way to open files for his rooks. Your dark square bishop is definitely more valuable than his rook on a. After . Nxd youre dominating the position and should win comfortably. Your only weakness on c is compensated by blacks pawn on a. Exchanging the two leaves you with a passed b pawn. It seems like you really lose the thread of the game here and make a string of poor moves. . Nc is strong. Remember you can block files with minor pieces if the queen is in front for an opponents battery. The idea is to transfer the knight to c. Even just . Rxa Qxc . Qxc Rxc . Rxa Rxe is good for you. The passed pawn should decide the game without trouble. . Ng is just a positional blunder that shows you dont have a clear plan. Instead look at the position after . Bxf Rxf You have control of the only open file. You have a protected passed pawn. Your knight can easily block any counterplay along the c file by going to c. His bishop cant attack anything in your entire position. At which point you trade the heavy pieces rooksqueen and win easily. Instead you let him take the a file infiltrate on it and your king pays the price. Hopefully this analysis has been helpful. ,chess,cfe2kxw,1,t5_2qhr7

437243,0,t3_1z2t37,I find it amusing watching strong blitz players on Youtube yourself Jerry Greg because sometimes you just say this seems right when making a move.  You have instincts based on thousands of patterns.Sometimes I see these moments of clarity eg Bxh with a Greek gift sacrifice.  Most of the time however I identify several candidate moves then calculate them far enough to see if they look safe annoying for the opponent or winning.  At my level this calculation could be much better.  Sometimes a safe move turns out to be unwise  moves later e.g. moving a pawn near a castled king creates an attacking diagonal.  Sometimes a winning move is not nearly as winning as another advancing a passed pawn instead of a tactic to win a minor piece.I try to ask myself questions like This is a good move but is there a better one? to distinguish degrees of winning.  I ask Am I chasing his piece to a better square? to answer whether my annoying move is effective.  And of course I ask where my pieces want to be.  But Ive concluded that effective calculation includes lots of pattern recognition to make shortcuts and to that end Im memorizing games reviewing every game I play and practicing tactics.,chess,cfq330v,2,t5_2qhr7

If you show a random position from a game between strong players to a GM a strong club player a weak player and someone who does not know the game let them look at the position for a while and then later ask them to recreate the position the GM does it easily the strong club player gets a lot of it right the weak player gets some major things right and the nonplayer does poorly.If you do the same thing but instead of showing a position from a strong game you first scramble the positions of the pieces totally at random the result is that the nonplayer still does poorlyin fact he does about the same as he does with a real position. The chess players will also do poorly just barely better than the nonplayer.This is because the players when they are looking at the position note not just the positions of the pieces but also relationships. They might note that white has castled kingside and not moved the king or rook since and that blacks got a knight on f that is pinned by a while bishop on h and so on. Theyll notice that the pawn formation matches that from a particular opening line or that white has a  vs.  majority on the queen side but has weakened his dark square with b.When they try to reconstruct the position then even if they have forgotten where a piece is they can reconstruct it from the relations that they remember. Cant remember if blacks knight went to f or e? Just remember that the bishop on h was pinning the knight and so the knight must be on f not e and the reminds you that the black queen is still on d if you were having trouble remembering that.The GM sees many more of these things and so much of what he is memorizing is stuff he is familiar with. Its kind of like memorizing a poemit is a lot easier if the poem is in a language you speak and is about something you understand. Try memorizing a poem that just consists of totally random madeup words and youll find it much much harder.So back to our blindfolded GM. If he is playing  masters his games will all have sensible positions with themes and patterns and relations that he understands. Hell have a relatively easy time recalling where everything is but hell need to play good moves to win.If he is playing  beginners the games will have ridiculous positions. Hell have a trivial time crushing his opponentsif he doesnt forget where their weirdly placed pieces are.,chess,cg14eya,11,t5_2qhr7
552110,0,t1_cg2i1sd,If by on he fly you mean in like  seconds then probably not.

Noone wants a knight on the rim so Nf.  White responds poorly by threatening the knight with Ne and it goes to the only nonattacked square other than where it came from.And Im about half right.

I started planning it around my th turn.Dont let it ruin your joy but since you asked yes this is a pretty fundamental mating pattern and if you keep improving youll soon be playing opponents who can see this danger well before you even play Qc. There are a lot of things here that grab the attention the Bishop pointing straight at the King from the start the Queen lined up with a Bishop or Rook. Also a good opponent will always ask themselves what the reason for your move was and planning Qxg is the most obvious answer for why youd play Qc so even if they werent wary before that they will be afterwards.All that said you did nice work identifying this idea recognizing obstacles like the defending Queen and systematically removing them.

1067368,0,t1_chplqtr,The only way to promote a pawn in a kingpawn endgame two kings and one pawn is for the king to be in front of the pawn during the opponents move and have access to the files on either side of said pawn. Thus there is a winning kingpawn endgame if the pawn is off the end files and the king is in front of the pawn. If the king is not in front of the pawn you get the endgame shown in the OP if the pawn is on the a or h file even if the king is in front of the pawn the opponent can trap the king in the corner and force a stalemate or force the king out from the winning position. TLDR  Pawn on a or h file is always a draw. Pawn in the center of the board might not be. ,chess,chpm4fa,2,t5_2qhr7

1083472,0,t3_26g3cs,The positional awareness is less than you can think. The big thing is the recognize tactics instantly have studied them for a long time and can hit on them. I got to ask a few of these questions to a guy whos  in bullet on chess.com has a huge tactics rating there too but is only  in other forms of play.Another thing and you can pick this up from the youtubes is premoving judiciously the best premove to make is a projected recapture because if the initial capture doesnt happen you havent blundered as such.This can extend even further. Lets assume you and your opponent have rooks on an open d file. You can each recapture with a rook so theres tension but not anything decisive yet. if your opponent takes you must retake of course so that should be your premove even if theres only like a  chance of that happening. So you could make the same premove for  moves without it materializing all while thinking of what you would do if that recapture DOESNT happen. this said i think it also helps to have a desktop I dont and great reflexes.,chess,chrfypp,3,t5_2qhr7

1102444,0,t3_26qcbi,Im in a similar situation and have been in it many times. Im mid s but I havent been active in chess for the last two years. While many people dont recommend studying openings to improve I think its very helpful to have a game plan for most major systems. I tend to forget some critical lines if I dont review after a hiatus. First off I dont think its worth switching to d at all. Would you feel comfortable facing a dutch kings indian or a nimzo? If you do plan on playing d you need to consider those. I think e is likely the way to go as you have more experience there. I would be surprised if you see the alekhine but a solid response is the exchange variation and is in my opinion easy to play from White without knowing much opening theory. If black goes into the cxd variation I like delaying Nf to not give Bg target. For example .e Nf .e Nd .d d .c Nb .exd cxd .Nc g .Be Bg .Rc  .b  is a pretty solid setup for white. The scandinavian is a bit annoying to deal with if youre unfamiliar. If you run into the gambit ... Nf an easy way to approach it is .d to give the pawn back or .c c .d cxd and now youre in the panovbotvinnik attack in the carokann. There are a couple tricks that black earlier in this line but this is by far the most common response. Dont try and hold on to that pawn unless you know what youre doing. If he goes ..Qxd I think the main line is a comfortable position to play for white. .Nc Qa .d c .Nf etc is not particularly dangerous. Either way I think you should prepare something for most major systems or at least have a line in mind. Pirc Sicillan dragon Sicillian Njadorf if you play open Sicillians French CaroKann are the big ones. ,chess,chtlr5n,3,t5_2qhr7

1336090,0,t1_cij969z,The USCF actually does a poor job of getting scholastic players to join. In many areas of the country there are regional scholastic organizations running their own rating systems and running numerous large tournaments. These activities are occurring completely outside the USCF. For team scholastic competition there are rules in many areas that actually prohibit teams from playing in USCF rated events they are not targeting USCF specificallythey prohibit school teams from competing in events that require any memberships other than in their states school athletic association.The USCF is only getting the small fraction of scholastic players who decide they want a USCF rating or membership. One reason a player might so decide is to participate in a national event such as the high school championships. Most scholastic players though only play in competitions in their area and do not need USCF memberships.The number of scholastic players is very large so even though the USCF only gets a small fraction of them they end up being a large fraction of USCF members.,chess,cijxd07,1,t5_2qhr7

Maybe a trip inside their head as this might be their only chance all year for an IM norm or whatnot. You might know the scene better than most. There are so many other interesting questions... for the top boards do they not show their main preparation against each other especially people who might be in the next candidates matches? Interviewing Julio Zuniga and other GMs more or less carrying middling nations could be interesting as well.

1581390,0,t3_2ccu4n,What I do is I sit down at a table with a real chessboard and a spiral notebook so I have a collection of all my handwritten analyses in one place.  I write down the date event and the players then the opening moves while playing the moves on the board.  When I reach the first move that I dont know as an autobook move I start writing down the reasons for the move and anything that I might have considered or rejected during the game as well as anything that I now know is right or wrong or possible in hindsight knowing what I know now.  I also try to come up with other ideas that I didnt consider during the game since I am under no pressure and have a fresh perspective on things and have some knowledge about how things wound up going.I try to be as concrete as I can when I write down these things.  For instance if I say castling isnt possible yet in my analysis I would include a concrete variation that demonstrates this concept.Pay a lot of attention to moves that you think were a mistake yours or your opponents.  Go into detail about why both tactically and positionally.  Basically write down as much as you can about your moves.  After you do this a lot youll get a feel for what kinds of things you should be writing and youll get better at it.Finally I think it is important to publish your analysis in some way or share it.  Having other especially strong players offering guidance in the game or the analysis process is extremely helpful.  Invaluable actually.The process is Put yourself back in the game situation tableboardnotebook. Record everything that was and is in your head about the game.  Fill your head up with thoughts and ideas then get them on the paper. Share that record with others so they can help fix the things that were in your head that are wrong.,chess,cjei9tl,1,t5_2qhr7

1810683,0,t3_2f9w37,If you look at the Black king youll notice that your b queen is covering the squares to the left right bottom left and bottom of it leaving only the square to its bottom right for escape. However your second queen is covering that square. Also youll note that the king isnt being directly attacked by any piece checked. Finally Black has only his king and no other piece to move. Therefore he cant make any legal move putting your king directly into the line of fire is illegal. Therefore because of a rule that I find silly but thats just like my opinion man the game is drawn.If your g queen was on the e square then it would cover that d escape square for the Black king but also give check. Therefore that would have been checkmate. In a similar vein if Black had a pawn on say f it would not be stalemate since he has the move pawn ff.e Its helpful to try visualising each square around the enemy king when giving checkmate. On your turn think carefully about which squares are covered by one of your pieces and which are not. If you see that the move you want to make will trap the enemy king without giving check find another move.Its worth noting that  queens are not necessary to give checkmate and I think just add more opportunity to get an unwanted stalemate. While the queen herself cannot checkmate a king alone you can trap it in a corner and bring your king over to finish him off. Just make sure not to cut off his only escape square.If you want to checkmate an enemy king with a lone queen there is a quite systematic and very pretty way to do so which is Method  of this guide Its not the fastest or most efficient way to do it but its easy to remember.Finally I want to say that some people on rchess are very hard on beginners. Not everyone some people can really be helpful and nice. Just ignore them.,chess,ck7d2e1,2,t5_2qhr7

Chinese Japanese and Western chess have the same basic mechanism move your pieces around capture enemy pieces and try to checkmate to opponents king but disagree on such things as size of the board how pieces move whether repetition is allowed what happens with stalemate etc etc.gtCertainly there is no chance that a western chess grand master could compete at the top level in xiangqi chinese chess.Thats because those are completely different games.

1990891,0,t1_ckt2xfr,As a SF developer I appreciate you taking the time to respond.  Gives some insight into the mind of an engine.  Some people say engines suck in closed positions and while I dont agree with that phrasing its definitely not untrue to say that they perhaps misevaluate them or at the very least dont provide much in the way of a plan for a human using an engine for analysis.A lot of the engine hate probably stems from the fact that we humans still want to believe we can outfox an engine at least in some way.In all honesty I havent used deep engine analysis in many many years as Im more of a casual chess player these days.  Every once in a while Ill quickly go through a game of mine and see the evaluation artificially lower because of the space issue so thats why I brought it up.  Perhaps I should just give it more time to think as you said.  Im usually just blunder checking my games so its largely irrelevant if it says Im . or . based on some abstract positional notion.I just felt the need to chime in and defend the commentators a bit.  Yeah saying Engines havent improved in  years is completely silly but I think some of the more specific points they brought up were logical and well supported by the game they were commenting on.

In a semiclosed position f is a little stronger as you can open the position quicker and attack.Edit just to clarify they are both solid setups in their own right.  They usually have different ideas though.  F usually plays for king side play while f looks play with the e pawn.

2490085,0,t1_cmj8de1,My school won our state championships two years in a row when I was in high school  and  so I got to play in this tournament a couple of times.Overall its definitely been my favourite tournament experience both times I have gone. Its held at one of the residential colleges of Melbourne University in a grand dining hall and all of the outofstate players stay in the unoccupied dorm rooms during uni holidays. Its run by a company called ChessKids that does almost all of the interschool chess comps across AustraliaThe tournament is Swisssystem winners play winners losers play losers etc with | time controls the years I went though they have been known to change oddly enough.The ratings which are just ChessKids ratings not FIDE are quite diverse click the Secondary tab and then Players  to view individual results so everyone finds a good match by round  or so. Technically you dont have to qualify for this tournament you just have to go to school and pay the entry fee. If you win a state title however you get a certain number of allexpensespaid spots depending on how well you did during the season. Our school got  spots free both years and we ended up taking  people total and splitting the remaining costs between the team. The tournament itself is held over two days with  games on the first day and  games on the second though I could be remembering this wrong. At the beginning of the tournament they give you a small paper booklet in which you write down your games in as well as use for a couple of activities during the day. After each game they have a number of chess coaches including IM James Morris and IM Robert Jamieson who will walk through your games with both players and analyse. The first year they offered it free for everyone and the second year they made you pay extra for the service which was disappointing but understandable because they were running into issues from games being delayed due to analysis accidentally running overtime. Asking for  I believe thinned out the pack a lot.Probably my favourite part of the whole tournament was during the evening of the first night when they hold an official transfer chess a.k.a. Bughouse chess tournament which anyone can enter in. My first year David Cordover the founder of ChessKids and his yearold son won which was rather embarrassing for the rest of us. They also have a stand selling souvenirs and chess booksequipment.

If you love theory you will have your hearts content of sharp forcing variations to study  mainly in the exchange variation d Nf c g Nc d cxd Nxd. Unfortunately many club players wont go into that and will instead play the formulaic dcNcBfe stuff. Fortunately Black has no trouble with that just castle quickly get c in and play against the dpawn. Your position has no real weaknesses and you can get a lot play on the queenside by opening the cfile and utilizing the DSB.And as HDRgument said if White wants to avoid all the interesting dc lines and play a stonewall or Colle then you just have to accept it.

2657441,0,t1_cn5c7ym,Wasnt trying to be rude its just obvious youre new to chess and a lot of people get the names wrong.Anyway There is no correct way to develop your pieces it depends on the situation and what your opponent is doing. I was suggesting those moves as they will make it hard for your opponent to attack you with his knights until later in the game.Moving pawns in the center  squares is usually a little better than moving them  square since that gives you more space to work with.Ill draw you a picture of an ideal setup to go for when developing. Obviously your opponent will usually not let you achieve this.Notice that the bishops and knights control the key center squares and also impact many other squares they can move to if needed. Also the king is safe and the whole army is ready to attack after only  moves.Here is an example of using a bishop to pin the knight so it cannot move right away. Also if it did move into a strong center square your knight could take it out if you want.Hope that helps!,chess,cn5ggn3,2,t5_2qhr7

MTG in particular i playtested a lot with teammates and friends to get a better grasp of certain matchups and improve my technical play. Im aware that facetoface is a good learning method.My criticism towards his post was only directed to the audience he wanted to learn from. Theres probably an argument to be made that you can learn something from playing anyone but a casual crowd of people with no strategic understanding is less likely to aid your learning than someone close to your level or slightly better. The environment he described is likely to be detrimental to someone already actively involved in online play exactly because information is taken in more effectively facetoface. Youre basically learning the wrong thing quicker...  All of this is MTG based so im not sure how far you can follow my argument here but basically you shouldnt go play at a club of  elo players to learn from them. The fact that you learn from them more effectively doesnt make the practice any better.  ,chess,cny1n7m,0,t5_2qhr7

3168081,0,t1_coq8d3a,Oh and as for the average rating piece its hard to say whether someone trending down like Caruana or trending up like Nakamura is likely to continue in the same direction. They may be showing signs of improvement and likely to keep going the same direction but they also might have previously been underrated and their upward trend was just a correction but maybe now theyre rated properly and wont continue the trend. Or maybe even they used to be accurately rated for their strength but then they had some luck and became overrated the upward trend and the most likely result going forward is for them to give those rating points back.Its hard to distinguish between these three scenarios so the simplest option is to assume that their current live rating is relatively accurate. If everyones published rating on the March through December lists averages their current live ratings then the top Candidates qualifiers by rating will be. Grischuk . Caruana .. Giri .. Topalov .. Nakamura .Notice that Caruana has a decent cushion over . If Grischuk were to qualify by the Grand Prix and Caruana didnt making Caruana  on the list of potential ratings qualifiers that cushion is enough that he has strong chances to finish at least top two.So either Caruana qualifies by the Grand Prix  OR hes a solid favorite not a lock of course... to qualify by rating especially since if he doesnt qualify by the Grand Prix its quite likely that Grischuk DOES.Plus if Caruana manages not to qualify through the Grand Prix or ratings hell likely be the best available option for that wild card spot that exists plus he also has a chance to qualify in the World Cup.Nothings guaranteed but between his rating and his Grand Prix standing Caruana is almost certainly the second most likely member of the Candidates field at this time behind Anand of course.,chess,coqdc0f,1,t5_2qhr7

3210641,0,t3_2wu63z,Check out HardicsayRusniok for my favorite plan when black develops the DSB to e. If black doesnt exchange the knight on d it goes to f and e. The d knight always has the possibility of jumping to f as well. Once thats achieved as mentioned by other people white has the standard plans of fe or the attack on the queenside. This plan is less effective when the DSB is on d and in that case I recommend attacking on the queenside as demonstrated well in GrabuzovaBurchardt The advance of the b pawn often forces weaknesses.Since this advance is so annoying black may try to stop it with a and Qe but fortunately in that case white has a ton of compensation if he just sacs the pawn.

Kasparov lost and threw a fit move on nothing to see here.The whole thing frankly just seems colossally silly  the team that built Deep Blue had already built multiple strong chess computers before  some of which had beaten grandmasters.

3917868,0,t3_35b59b,tldr weak inexperienced player is looking for feedback on the thought process when selecting a move.I like to hijack this and ask a general question about how I should think in a position like thisFrom what I read in here and from what I see on youtube I should approach this by selecting candidate moves without thinking to much about them.When I do that a get a ton of options Nxc Bxc  Bb Bf Nh Ne ... which brings me to my first questionWhen do I stop looking for candidate moves? Do I have to rule out other options on the spot because the just feel wrong? For example should I look at Bg even though I dont like how its unprotected there?Should I just pick my candiates and stick with them no matter what?I am asking because I feel that my thought process is very fluent and unstructured and I am not sure if I should try to change that.The obvious other question is when I got my candidates how do I know when to move to the next option? Is that something I should do very clinical as well? Look at option  Nxc check the obvious reply dxc Qxc Qd outch  ok lets not do that maybe retake with Bc but then I just droppet a knight strike Nxc  I would probably rule out Bxc as well for the same reason.When thinking about  my mind drifted to What is blacks threat? I guess that comes before candidate moves? Bb development the fork on c looks bad but he needs d first and then I can just take on Nc and I kinda like my knight there. Is that just a move I kind of keep as a plan? plan b DBf to prepare e  but now I am thinking I could play e right away. I think I like that. if he takes I can take on c. If he moves past I take on e. If he does neither I take on d and afterwards get a pawn on c. Should I look deeper into that line? Should I continue with Nh and soo how that looks?As I said I am not looking for comments on my moves just for some general feedback about how to think while playing. How much strucktur vs how much searching for a better move? Is this all just experience and I should just not worry about it?,chess,cr2vfl1,2,t5_2qhr7

There is also a cottage industry around learning Spanish that will have you spend a lot of money if you want to improve.  Some of the material is good some is garbage but in both cases the real work lies with you and has nothing to do with intelligence.gt It doesnt work.And yet there are so many people it has worked for.  This is why I think you have just given up and chosen to blame fate rather than taking responsibility for your own work.gt If you studied at least the way youre talking about for a year you would be further than  if you had any ability.My study wasnt as good as it should have been during that year and I wasnt playing enough for most of it.  Unfortunately at the time I was working  hour weeks and raising two very small kids so I wasnt able to put in as much time as I should have which is on me.

I have more time now for study since my kids are older and I have a more sane job so I expect a lot more improvement now.

4115819,0,t3_37rk9k,Good idea. The success really depends on willingness of strong players to provide thorough analysis. Something Ive been thinking about and which you might want to integrate in your platform is chess video requests. For example a person requests a video analysis be made of their or anyone elses game with certain terms perhaps such as more time devoted to the middle and endgame and little on the opening etc and anyone can bid to make the video and upload it. You make a YouTube channel where you upload videos produced by anyone successfully chosen to make the video. The person who requested the video will have paid but the payment to the person who produced the video is pending a threshold approval score on YouTube. For example if the video gets negative marks the producer does not get paid a high positive score means the funds that are locked can be released say after the video has been on YouTube for atleast a week. As the website manager and owner of the YouTube channel you get paid from the YouTube ads the chess producer gets paid by the video requester and the video gets their game analysed be the person they wanted.......the public hopefully get to enjoy a good YouTube chess video. Everyone wins..... If Dennis Monokorous Jesse Kraai Andrew Martin and Daniel King join in then this site will be fantastic.,chess,crpfgre,2,t5_2qhr7

The second one you should focus on is queen and king vs king endgame. The whole boxing in sequence.If youre comfortable with those mating pattern then the next simple thing to focus on is pawn endgames. Things like the pawn square and creating passed pawns. If youre able to get QR or just a Q from a pawn endgame you should be able to find that mate. Finally if you have a big material advantage dont be afraid to simplify. Say you have QRBpawns vs his  pawns. If you can trade your bishop and two pawns for his three do it and clear the way for the easy lawnmower mate pattern.,chess,crqdf07,4,t5_2qhr7

Doubt me? look at the U WC games and see how they play. want to bore kids and have them hate chess teach them endgames.

4155535,0,t1_crtwora,I had to go through every move of that game with my Deep Shredder  chess engine.  Guess Im slightly obsessed with this event  but since that was given as blatant it was too enticing to not investigate.  What I discovered  If I changed the strength level almost every move I could sim every move of Tilicheev Viacheslav.   And I mean radical changes in strength  ranging from GM to beginner.   But at the end of the exercise I still wonder how many other players movements I could simduplicate given enough time to change strength and other varied settings?  Basically the engine will pretty much cover almost every move almost anybody could think of  from a beginner anybody to a GM anybody if you keep changing settings.  In the end I didnt prove a dam thing. But it was an interesting walkI guess if I have any takeaway its this just because I can dup all your moves in my engine especially tweaking settings doesnt mean you cheated.  I suppose too that if I could have got my Shredder to play just like Viacheslav On Only One Setting now That might have inclined me to think he cheated.   But instead I got nothing from the exercise no convincing evidence of cheating.  ,chess,crtxza8,12,t5_2qhr7

Only the queen capture on b has a potential for trouble since all other captures can be easily replied to.Are there any checkscaptures for me to make? Nxd would lead to something retaking it and weaken my presence on the kingside Rxc or Nxc is poor. In these circumstances I just count the attacks on a square. We both have  attackers on the c square so if I move first he will win that exchange I get a bishop and pawn he gets a knight and rook The obvious Qa. Kc is forced.  From this position there are  checking moves. Rxcis diffused with Bxc.  Nxd is diffused with either the queen or rook.  Qa forces Kd and attacks my queen so if I want to continue this it needs to be forced. Rxc here is protected from the king capture but the bishop could just take. It would be nice if the bishop was pinned!Are there any threats that help that sequence? Rd would threaten that queen. It is protected by my queen so his queen must move. Does having my rook on d with the queen out of threat help that mate threat? It does! By pinning the bishop the king has to go to e after the rook check  where Nxd! forces the king to f and Qxd is a classic lawnmower mate!Where can the queen move? Are any of those places dangerous or can prevent this? Anywhere along the diagonal to h is suicide Capturing the pawn on b is also suicide All other queen captures the two rooks or the pawn on f can give him enough time to get out of the mate but he losses his queen for a rook at best Bb attacking my queen just leads me to grab the bishop with no compensation. There might be a better way to take advantage of this but I would just take the bishop he would still have to get his queen out and I could trade my knight for his bishop on d and begin a simplification gameIt seems long...but I used almost half my game clock on this move.

4806729,0,t3_3goo32,Saying your brain is not capable of calculating  or  moves is like saying your brain is not capable of reading and understanding paragraphs of  or  sentences.  You can do it you just need more practice.  You are still trying to read one letter at a time and are daunted by the whole paragraph in front of you.  As you get better you will be able to read whole words instead of just letters whole sentences instead of just words and then see the paragraph as a whole instead of just its component parts.  Hopefully you get the analogy.  Your brain cant do  or  move calculations because it is trying to do it by each individual component instead of in chunks.  As you get better at chess your brain will make more connections faster and the  or  moves calculations will be like  or  word sentences to you now.  If you read the sentence My brother makes twice as many mistakes as I do you have no trouble understanding it and even closing your eyes and repeating it back.  That sentence is actually a pretty complex thing it just doesnt seem like it because your brain sees it as a whole thingyouve encountered all the pieces of that sentence so many times your brain has no trouble putting them together.  How did you get to that point?  Living and breathing the language as much as you can for a long time.Its that way with chess.  You shouldnt give up on chess because you cant just do something complex like that.  It doesnt come naturally.  It comes as a result of total immersion.

4859122,0,t3_3hfz1r,Time is a crucial factor in blitz so thats of course a reason. I dont know the time controls you played but you could first try and play some games with increment such as  or something that you get some time with each move. Time management is super important I dont like to waste time in the opening try to get into your own openings to save time.For the actual playing part blitz is in part intuition and pattern recognition. Tactical motifs like pins skewers and forks pop up probably all throughout the game and you need to be constantly aware. For an untrained eye this can be time consuming which is costly on the clock but with some experience you can spot these motifs and patterns quicker and prevent yourself from blundering. Tactics training can help a lot to increase your tactical awareness and your instinct to spot these tactical motifs. Also a quick analysis of your lost blitz games to see what exactly you missed how you missed it et cetera can help to figure out your weak points and where you can improve.,chess,cu711jc,4,t5_2qhr7

4926318,0,t1_cufgk2n,gt The basic idea is that the government is meant to serve basic public interests which are necessary and benefit society as a whole instead of an individual.So if a government uses tax income on anything that doesnt fit your views thats theft? If chess were indeed funded by taxes would that be theft and extortion? Does the judicial system agree with that definition?gt No Minnesota and San Francisco are not communist though they are to some degree socialist leaning and thats exactly why the government should not be funding chess in those places.My point was that the economy already works like that. Taxes fund culture and arts things that chess can be classified as. Or sports. So why is chess special in that it cant be funded by taxes without leading to stealingextortion or leading to communismsocialism?You say that the government is meant to serve basic public interests that benefit society. Chess can benefit society inasmuch as sports and schools can wouldnt you say? There are several countries that have chess in schools. Are they all communistsocialist? Armenia India Turkey?gt Chess is not something that should be paid for by the taxpayers. It should be funded privately.Im not arguing for or against public funding of chess here but I dont understand why youre saying that taxing people to promote chess is basically stealingextortion that can only occur in more socialistcommunist parts of the world where thats how the economy works.

Main lines will probably be the same. You might wanna go over games by GMs and see what they do too.That said Im sure the book is good enough for a start.

5193398,0,t3_3m4qbn,No. Single elimination is a really unpopular format of course as I say that a . million dollar international single elimination tournament is going on right now. We like Swiss system and warzone type tournaments. In a warzone you always play blitzbullet and as soon as youre finished with your game you get paired with someone else whos waiting so winning fast and knowing when to resign and move on is just as important as winning. The goal is just to get the most points.Chesscube has a convoluted currency system but its one of the reasons its waning in popularity. Lichess offers free unlimited warzones and I think Swiss too. Chess.com has Swiss only and theyre limited for free members.BTW there are no places to play online chess barring invitationals for actual money or credits you can cash out with.

5346239,0,t1_cvv0wgn,.  Still seems rather ambiguous as to whether a wikipedia article is similar to memes jokes videos or images.  Why not just say that you should post no content that doesnt provide useful chess insight?.  I could also argue that the term useful chess insight is rather ambiguous.  The post gives insight into chess insofar as it is an aspect of pop culture.Either way the post isnt explicitly ruled against in the sidebar. It would seem that a ruling could be levied against it by whomever holds the power to interpret the rules I would assume the mods. However if they wish to be stringent then they can change the rule listing to give a better demarcation of what is and isnt allowed in the sub.  Given the lack of clear demarcation I would assume that the rule is made to allow leeway to posters.  I would also point out that the post doesnt clearly fit in any subreddit that rchess recommends. ranarchy allows it according to the rules but skews more to humour than news.,chess,cvv1j6l,3,t5_2qhr7

One of the early explorers of the Hedgehog structure along with Ulf Andersson.I think part of the reason why he never qualified out of the many interzonals that hed played in was a similar reason to why e.g. Walter Browne had never qualified  too uncompromising in individual games and unwilling to sort of think of the tournament as a metagame.I really wish hed write a book or two really interesting guy judging by the few interviews Ive read.

Where more than one opponent is below the floor the rating of the lowest opponent shall be raised.So wouldnt the  rated player be counted as ?

My Vegas reference wasnt meant to be endallbeall proof or anything just an example.In terms of street hustlers I would be very interested to see rating levels of their first official tournament.  Id be surprised to see any break .  An initial expert rating would make me eat my hat.  I think what youre referring to is how an expertrated tournament player might occasionally be matched in blitz ability to street payers.  I concede that this is true but it comes with caveats The absolute best street hustlers top out around expert level in blitz and even then its usually with tournament practice behind them Expertlevel blitz street players will not play expertlevel chess at standard time controls in tournament conditions GM is another planet from expert.In terms of the Starcraft comment I made theres a large body of history behind my loaded comment.  Without going into obscene amounts of unrelated details Ill mention that team houses have without exception produced every top player since the game became competitive.  Despite the common fantasy of going from online selfstudying prodigy to Code S competitor.,chess,cxqrn89,1,t5_2qhr7

The result is posted..  If rsoccer could do it with k subscribers or various other esport subs where Im also subscribed or various popular tv shows like FargoGoTs theres no reason rchess cannot.  I dont know what your personal thing with it is and no I dont remember that thread.You think its okay to not give a subscriber even a few hours before spoilers can run free thats fine.

Its simply something I didnt know this sub was okay with and now that I do  I left.  I couldve done so without making that statement hence why I deleted those posts.

I followed it during world championships for both years without any spoilers within a reasonable time just fine.

Whos omitting context now?Your level of chess understanding is at the point where you had to read Wikipedia to find out about Kramniks use of the Catalan.

The shortest interval for a prayer is Maghrib the th prayer which generally has a prayer interval of a little over an hour after sundown. Whatever time that is in your area the Muslim should be planning ahead and not be attending a chess competition at that time if he knows his game will be  mins. Other prayers have pretty large intervals  hours for midday and  for the afternoon prayer so its on them if they cant plan ahead. Why is the government making that decision for them I dont know.

Understanding the theory of how tactics work is one thing but putting that knowledge into practice is a huge part of improving.Now you could pause the video when the position is first presented and try to solve it yourself before John does.

I served me well against many opponents but I also got burnt many times against tactics that defied the fact that I had a good pawn structure against umpteen doubled pawns. The way to make your theory and strategy strong is by focusing on the tactics. Your strategy doesnt account for the fact that you have left e open for their knight to fork your king and queen. Tactics helps you to spot that both defensively and offensively. I highly recommend chesstempo.com its free! for well rounded tactics training.,chess,d0oss5l,5,t5_2qhr7

6848774,0,t3_49k8ai,I looked over several of you games not super in depth and the biggest thing I noticed was that you are playing a | time control which awesome for learning but many of the mistakes look like bullet or fast blitz mistakes. You and your opponents are hanging pieces from the opening the end game. In your game vs Whippany a few days ago you blundered your knight on move  taking his queens pawn that was protected by his unmoved queen. You should focus on not hanging pieces before you move to a square look first who controls the square. If you are moving your piece to a completely undefended square keep that in mind until it moves or is protected because it is a target. If an opponent moves a piece to an undefended square it is a target explore ways to exploit that or at least keep it in mind for future moves. Jon Bartholomews Climbing the Rating Ladder can really help you. The major focus of the first few videos in the series is about unprotected pieces. It was eye opening to me and finding that if I dont hang pieces my also low rated partner is likely to do so. I dont just sit back and defend but Ive caught myself several times before moving to undefended squares seeing the danger and choosing a more sound plan.  Maybe you should change up your openings a little. Maybe play d and look to develop and play solid closed positions. You seem to be losing on both sides of . e e out of the opening often dropping your dpawn playing both sides losing your center control. In the end sometimes its hard to translate what you have learned into actual play on the board and studying seems like a chore. If you are hating studying or working on a specific part of your game it often will not be helpful. When I get frustrated or feel like its too much work I think about what would be interesting to learn or try out. Maybe its a silly Gambit opening maybe play Crazyhouse maybe I just want to learn endgame tactics. Sometimes it shamefully makes me happy to turn a chess computer on its lowest difficulty and have a stress free game crushing it. ,chess,d0sm697,6,t5_2qhr7

6892049,1,t1_d0xiwzm,How about this... Ignore the legalities and just ask yourself should Fide be allowed to monetize the candidates by selling access to it? Their argument is that selling exclusive rights access will bring in more money for the players. I think yes. I really dont care about the legal arguments as I said I hope Agon wins because it will support the Fide position that it is allowed to say who and how and when games it hosts are publicized. I beleived thats in the long term interests of the game. If you also agree then the side cases and the legal measures that are needed can be squabbled over by lawyers. But if you agree in principle that Fide was right to sell rights to the games then you should probably support Agons legal challenges. If you disagree then there is no point arguing over legalities or corner cases because even if the laws support Agons views you would still not be in favour of it. I suspect Im being down voted because people are against Fide selling access rights. They are usin the excuse that its illegal but even if it werent illegal I think people would still object in principle. And thats fine. ,chess,d0xj5ez,-1,t5_2qhr7

7017601,0,t3_4brn1u,This game is actually pretty instructive on the concept of tempo in the opening.Roughly speaking you can gain time if you make a move that both achieves a goal like development and forces your opponent to respond to that move instead of working on their own development.You may think its bad to play . exd because after your opponent recaptures he has a piece developed and you dont making him apparently ahead in development. But you can play . Nc developing your knight with tempo. This attacks the Queen meaning that your opponent must move it again instead of developing another piece and you have your move advantage as White back. In your game your opponent used a similar concept when he played ... c. As you know a its a guideline that you shouldnt make too many early pawn moves because it wastes time that you could use developing pieces. But because ... c forces you to move your knight its made with tempo and it doesnt lose time. It also opens a diagonal to develop his queen so it achieves some development goals. ,chess,d1bskn6,2,t5_2qhr7

7022672,0,t3_4bsub7,As a general rule in the opening  early middlegame usually !  pieces are better than a rook simply because still not many open files open and the minor pieces will have much more influence in the game. For this reason the classical beginer capture Bxf Rxf Nxf Kxf is bad. In some endgames with less pieces and few pawns the rook sometimes can balance the power or the  pieces. But like everything in chess the concrete position is very important.I add Stop doing this double check thing this you have to do it with your mind.

7795129,0,t3_4m2522,gt Ive watched IM John Bartholomews undefended pieces chess fundamentals video and have spent the last six months really taking those lessons to heart and putting them into practice. I rarely hang pieces anymore and this has helped me go above  in chess.com.gt a lot of trades end up doubling my pawns which I think is kind of bad. This usually happens in the opening where my opponent knows some kind of line that will give him or her some slight edge. I have no opening knowledge whatsoever as the FAQ said to study tactics. gt I almost always lose on time because my opponents are plaing faster than me. I try my best to find the best move and get myself to a point where Im up in material and usually just lose because Ive run out of time.I think that if youve been at it for that long you can start putting together an opening repertoire. A lot of new players study opening theory and are rightfully yelled at to study tactics instead and youve done the exact opposite. You should still study tactics but if you have absolutely no knowledge of opening theory its really no surprise that you keep finding yourself in sticky situations and time trouble. As long as your opponents are in their book and you arent they are going to be much faster and more accurate than you are. Right now you dont even have a book and believe it or not many of your  opponents do have at least some semblance of one. They usually have the opposite problem as you they have a basic plan but will routinely hang pieces while executing it.gt Third I have trouble coming up with plansdoing something active and just revert to making sure everything I have is just defended. These leads to many doubled pawns as mentioned earlier.Well firstly you will gain a lot of insight into planmaking if you study some openings. Both sides of every respectable opening have some basic plans that just come with the territory. For instance as Black in the NimzoIndian defense I know that in most games Im going to exchange off my darksquare Bishop and then put tons of pawns on dark squares forming a solid combination with my remaining Bishop. Its a very basic plan but it helps to guide your choices when you can see many candidate moves. Sometimes a plan has to do with creating longterm weakness to exploit later which is one of the problems youve been running into. Try to figure out which pawn breaks and which captures would be awkward for your opponent to respond to. If you cant see anything like that try to figure out which of your pieces are on the relatively poorest squares and improve them to better squares. Failing all of that focus on your opponents last move. What is he trying to accomplish? Which squares did he just gain and lose control over? What ranks and files are now more open or clogged than before? Almost every move you can make on the chessboard has both upsides and downsides. Playing moves that take advantage of the downside of your opponents last move is frequently referred to as addressing the weakness of the last move. ,chess,d3s8bwp,2,t5_2qhr7

Should really help you learn the basics and then also set you up so you can keep learninggt ...do i advance my knight or my bishop first?gt The usual advice is Knights before Bishops. Its a little easier to know where you want to put your Knights usually cf occasionally de than your Bishops which could go practically anywhere depending on circumstances so it can be nice to wait until you have a little more information. But dont get too hung up on it at your level you arent supergreat at picking the optimal place for every piece anyhow. Just get them out there.Expanding on this so you dont always play the italian four knights because you were taught knights before bishops which is real boring at all levels is that you shouldnt move a bishop until the knight next to it has moved.

They can see the difficulty of the decision by examining the position on the board and its complexity. They do this by totting up all possible moves and then working out what fraction of them are blunders. So a position in which all moves except one are blunders is more difficult than a position in which only one move out of many is a blunder.This is the main part of the article that doesnt make sense to me.

8165837,0,t3_4r3ext,This reminds me a little of a post I answered on Facebook a little while ago that spoke about rating and how people are too focused on their rating and perhaps worried that they are underrated. Its not completely relevant but I think it would serve you well to read what I wroteI think most chess players are capable of performing above their rating but not all the time. People are much more likely to disregard their losses as something stupid or uncharacteristic yet fail to examine the issue as it reoccurs. So while its probably true that most people have an ability that is characteristic of higher rated players in at least one facet of the game positional understanding opening knowledge variations calculation etc a players rating is a reflection of all of a players strengths and weaknesses and how they interact within tournament conditions. A rating is never truly reflective since it is always fluctuating.Ultimately its best to just focus on evaluating your abilities and building on your strengths and improving your weaknesses. Rating will come and settle around where it should. Its just easy to use the rating system in reference to goals you make since it is easily measurable and comparable. But until you make concrete goals that dont involve rating and involve pure chess progress will not be made.,chess,d4ya1ot,3,t5_2qhr7

8423645,0,t3_4uy1ui,If by super strong you mean among the very best then its highly unlikely. My guesstimate would be that you can make up something around  points by being a good blitz player. That means that a  player that is very good at blitz might score  against a  player who is bad at blitz. Might be a littler more or less. So yes you can be very strong without a FIDE rating or a title but it is very tough to be among the very best in online blitz.There are examples of very strong players who didnt have a title or an Elo but those are most often from the old days where it was much harder to obtain an Elo and achieve title norms Kramnik was above  while only beeing an FM Kasparov won a GM tournament while not having an Elo etc. Nowadays nearly everyone gets an Elo or a national rating very fast. When you are a somewhat talented kid you probably play in nationalworld championchips. Long story short if you meet someone who has no chess record at all who claims to be very strong i would probably doubt it.To be competitive at the very top you need at least an OTB strength of   and since there are a lot of  guys playing online i guess close to  would be better. So if you see someone who claims to play only online and doesnt have a FIDE or national rating but is beating some of the best players in the world online its just a matter of what you believe. Do you believe someone reached GM strength by only playing online and for some reason hasnt played any OTB games or do you think that he might get a little help.,chess,d5uhwvs,1,t5_2qhr7

8697370,0,t1_d6srorn,To be honest I havent noticed the kind of behavior youve described. Most downvoted posts are from people being rude or condescending. Sometimes a post is seemingly downvoted for no reason but I dont think theres any real pattern to it other than the whims of the subreddit. This isnt an issue exclusive to rchess so one particular post or comment being downvoted doesnt really say much. While its true that many players here would get the same kind of helpadvice from reading some books they might enjoy the interactive aspect of reddit more and obviously they will be hesitant to pay for a coach at a level where they could just get advice from reddit. Thats why they come here and theres no reason to discourage them from doing so really. It looks like your real issue is that lower level players are crowding out  discussion for higher level ones without showing any kind of appreciation for the help that makes their own improvement possible. I cant say Ive really seen anything of the sort so unless you can really point out a consistent trend in this subreddit your best bet is going to make a new one that suits your own vision for a chess subreddit more. ,chess,d6sswmb,1,t5_2qhr7

Its not particularly challenging for white to get nice positions. Black aims to create an imbalanced central position but often has awkward development as a result....Nf  The Indian Defenses. Black typically delays deciding on a pawn structure in favor of keeping things flexible a few more moves. He can continue with either ...e NimzoQueens IndianBenoni or  ...g Kings IndianGrunfeld. ...d  The Queens Pawn openings. After . c black again has a variety of choices  ...dxc  The queens gambit accepted. For a newbie something like . e and taking back the pawn quickly is probably best. Black aims to develop solidly while white reclaims his pawn. ...e  The queens gambit declined. Black refuses to yield his central space and white has various ways to pose problems to black. Recommendation QGD Exchange with . Nc Nf . cxd exd. ...c  The Slav. Black simultaneously discourages an exchange on d by maintaining symmetrical structure and prepares dxc as b will be a legitimate threat. Youll likely need to eventually develop something for each of these although at your level just having a simple development scheme for each of them will set you miles ahead.Those are the main branches to get your feet wet with.

The point is that women receive negative forms of treatment more than men. So the claim that men arent bothered seems to miss the point. Men arent treated in the same negative ways.On the youtube stuff you should understand that my point was merely to add one more example to the many quotes from top professional players that Shahade quoted in his article. The idea was to establish a trend. Professional players shouldnt say that stuff broadcasters at events shouldnt players at local tournaments shouldnt and people online shouldnt either. Whether its online or offline I dont see you making a justification for why people ought to be able to say sexist things.You seem to continue to claim that there is no evidence that women find sexist comments harmful. Have you ever said something intentionally sexist to a woman before? What was the response? Im assuming that you avoided doing so because you felt it would be inappropriate. Thats good. My point is that in addition to intentionally sexist things perhaps there are also some unintentionally sexist things that you dont realize you are saying and nobody before me has corrected you before.Even if there is a chance that sexist comments arent harmful shouldnt we err on the chance that they are? To me it seems obvious that I dont need evidence on whether saying something mean to someone will be interpreted in a negative way and that is enough to not say it.,chess,d885nbv,1,t5_2qhr7

Obviously a healthy and balanced diet composed of all necessary nutrients and with adequate protein will help anyone perform at their maximum potential but Anand certainly has a lot more going for him than just a clean vegetarian diet. The only thing Im saying your original point of  super GMs eating vegetarian is nothing more than an interesting factoid. Vegetarianism is a first world luxury and studies have shown time and time again that without proper balancing nutrient supplementation and protein consumption they can be lessthanideal for brain function. Some studies have even shown an increase in mental health disorders in vegetarians although with the disclaimer that socioeconomic factors are at play as well. Im not bashing vegetarianism or saying that its impossible to eat a healthy and balanced diet as a vegetarian. Its just that vegetarianism does not provide any mental advantages over meatrich diets  in fact without proper supplementation the opposite is true.Some recent studies have found that within certain demographics vegetarians have higher IQs than their meateating counterparts but as always correlation does not equal causation. Many vegetarians choose not to eat meat for ethical reasons implying that they may have been more informed and cultured than the average individual prior to becoming vegetarian. One study in particular showed that a higher IQ at age  regardless of diet led to a higher chance of being vegetarian at age .Supporting studies,chess,d8finnw,4,t5_2qhr7

9231122,0,t3_56spcm,Couple of thoughts.Bb is not bad because the mildly ineffective pin albeit it is or because e and d are better squares but mostly because .Nb was much stronger exploiting the premature queen sortie... Black has quite some trouble defending both d and c from a check you can follow with Qc so they will most likely have to give up castling.e is not worth two question marks and maybe not even one... while it does indeed divert the defender of the Bb there is no immediate threat here since you can still counter Qa with Nc that problem becomes real only after you exchange in dAfter the piece blunder there is not much else going on since Black played very safe with no real mistakes... again the two Knight moves marked with ? do not really deserve that they may be slightly more passive than the alternatives but they did not alter the nature of his position and they did not offer you any leverage for a tactical shot or for meaningful improvement of yoursA quick note on the two Stockfish variations always be slightly skeptical and double check those long nonforced lines especially when the score is already heavily slanted to one side... looking with fresh eyes is true for machines as well because of depth issuesTake move  where the CPU seems to suggest that Qxa is worth almost  points more than yours and gives you a suggested line up to move  that . however is what the engine sees starting from  but if you actually follow the moves and let it work again you will notice that the evaluation of the end position at .Bxa is now entirely different and again back at .xx... this is because you have pushed the horizon further and since again those move are not strictly forced and the resulting position still far from a matetablebase win hes now seeing stuff he wasnt able to see back at the beginning of the line,chess,d8m41xi,1,t5_2qhr7

9427977,0,t3_59qxxk,I like how blunt you are in your analysis.  Players who own their mistakes and try to learn from them rather than making up excuses tend to prosper.  It also means I dont feel bad about being equally blunt.gt...Qc Developing my queen with aims on the kingside.Bd should probably come first.  As a rule minor pieces get developed before the heavier ones because they will generally have fewer options.  Bd also gives us the option to castle immediately should it become necessary and there is a line for white where the king being stuck on e matters after Qc .Nh with the threat of .Nxf exf .Qe.  This has the potential to be disruptive it forces us to place a piece suboptimally to answer the check and could well be enough for white to steal the initiative.gtwhile waiting for him to decide which way to castle if at all.Hes castling kingside because the other options are terrible.  The question you should be asking yourself is not where is his king going to be but where is he weak.  Thats where you should attack.  If that happens to be where his king is then you have an extra target for your attack but if hes weak on the queenside or the centre you should attack there.  With a doubled iso on the d file  a file which is open to our rooks I would be looking for play in the centre.  Perhaps I can pick one of those pawns up but at the very least I can force him to put his pieces on bad squares to defend them.gtThis will prepare gg as part of my attack. By doing this I am basically committing to castling long and attacking his kingside.Not every attack needs to be a pawnstorm and castling queenside would give him attacking chances because of his semiopen c file.  Also Ne was pure crap and if that knight was still on c he would have a meaningful threat in Nb which would at the very least allow him to trade off the d bishop.gt.Bc? This does nothing except remove the influence his rook had on the cfile. Well the bishop can move again perhaps with a discovered attack on the c file.  What hes doing here with Ne and Bc is overprotecting the d pawn which he has correctly determined be a key feature of the position.  He may also find the opportunity to play d with some kind of discovered attack on the long diagonal especially if youve played g exposing the h rook andor removing the pawn defending f.  After Bc my move would be Nd putting the clamp on that whole fiasco.gt.bAs prophesised several moves ago .Nb!  and we obviously cant play cxb because white has .Bxf Bxf .Rxc Kxc .Qf Bd .Qxg Bxb .Qf Bf .Qxf with additional threat of Qxd.  So ...Qb .Bd and all of a sudden castling queenside seems like a bad idea.gtThis skewer was not intended to net the rook but rather to allow an opening up of the kings position after Nf to block the attack.Unfortunately you overlooked .f which answers your threat effectively and with tempo allowing white a move to further his advance on the queenside.  Something like ...Be .Ba Nb .bxc and its all going horribly wrong.gtStill done on basic principle not because of the mate it sets up.That principle is correct.  You arent really setting up a mate here just making your pieces better and creating threats forcing him to compromise his own pieces to defend as he should have done with .Be.gtbut I should have seen the better Rxf!Its not the easiest checkmate to see but Ill wager youll find it next time.gtThis was a waiting move to see if he would take the free pawn and give me mate. Unnecessary.Not unnecessary actively bad.  Never give your opponent a free move.  Never give your opponent a free anything and never play hoping he will make a mistake.  Best move every move.I appreciate that in the context of your studying kingside attacks youre going to try to engineer them in your games but its important to understand that you dont get to arbitrarily decide where you attack.  Where are you strong where is he weak  this is what determines where we attack.  You made substantial and significant compromises to create the attack you had premeditated and while this opponent got it horribly wrong repeatedly future opponents will be less forgiving.Also in reply to another comment you said you should have left your king in the centre since you were intending to push your kingside pawns.  With open c and e files this would be crazy.  What you should have done is realise that you were going to have to castle kingside and accept that throwing the pawns at him wasnt a resource that was available to you on this occasion.Any questions feel free to throw them at me.,chess,d9b27fd,3,t5_2qhr7

A trivial example as white I want to exchange light square bishops in KID. If a weaker player as black doesnt know this and does nothing to prevent it I have easier play. If were playing an endgame where I know what I need to do and you dont thus you dont provide proper resistance my computer evaluation will smoothly go up and I wont have much centipawn loss simply because Im doing exactly the right thing. Tldr stronger player knows what needs to be done thus has a pool of strong candidate moves which ultimately lead to better play and less centipawn loss.

9825937,0,t1_daoa9mm,If youre a fairly new player I recommend you dont invest too much time in pure opening study. Your time is probably better spent doing tactics training and playing games. Like others are saying its probably a good idea to have a fixed repertoire for example you should always open with the same first move when youre white e.g. .e. Now your opponent might play a move you are familiar with lets say ..e in which case you know what to do .Nf. At some point however you will find yourself in a position you havent seen before lets say your opponent plays ..Nf. Now you just have to try to find good moves on your own keeping in mind the basic opening principles Develop your pieces control the center get castled. Remember to try to understand what your opponents ideas are and of course be on the lookout for mistakes by your opponent.When the game is finished you can go back to the first point where you didnt know what to do. Now if you ever find yourself in this position again you should be prepared for it. One way to do this is to look up the position in a database and see what the most played moves are. This way your opening repertoire will grow a little bit with every game you play. The downside is that you will in some cases memorize moves without actually understanding why they are good. In general you should look over the whole game after you played it and try to identify the most important mistakes you made so that you wont make a similar mistake next time. This should improve your play in all phases of the game over time.,chess,daoc9ri,2,t5_2qhr7

9869622,0,t1_dau14oo,Yeah but he was doing playable moves. I wasnt talking about moves but just the positions.Similar nonetheless but he is doing possible games based on a growing tree. Im less interested in how that works as the same positions occur repeatedly billions of times if you do it like that. The playable moves would lead to the same playable positions eventually I guess. But it gives bad logic being not something I can say I agree with as its wrong to count possible number of moves as the amount of game variation.EditFinally found the numbers of real playable chess not the hypothetical nonsense. Took long enough to find...When played correctly such as a GM playing a GM here are the actual calculated estimates for how many different chess games are possiblemaximumlogical possible positions maximum logical possiblegamesTotal draw positionsat  of playable games On how this relates to topic this would not be just the moves an engine searches but would be what it found to play as the best playable moves after searching all the possible moves.Edit Edit Thats not saying there arent ways to reach many more positions they just would use moves that arent logical. That is a lot of ways to play even still. Millions of different games that can be played with moves that makes sense is still a lot of ways... Some people think these numbers are much too high though I think they are probably a pretty good estimate being as the math used to calculate it included games that last upwards of  moves.,chess,dau197e,-2,t5_2qhr7

9965918,0,t3_5i9qp0,I have tried the DG against the Sicilian multiple times and have not liked the resulting position. E completely shuts down the light square bishop and is not worth the loss of the second pawn. The SM on the other hand is worth the loss of the single pawn against e because the Dark Square Bishop is on a different diagonal. Also often black will push the light squared bishop back as in the rut Lopez so that it attacks the h square while also not restricting the queens file .When I first started playing these openings against c and e I used to think they were similar openings. Someone disabused me of that notion and I basically just took their word on it. As I have been playing it I am realizing just how right they were. E changes the entire board. The attacking lines are not even close to the same. Approach the the openings as separate openings in your mind. Dont assume that because the Queen works on b in the DG it will also work on b in the SM.,chess,db6l2rb,1,t5_2qhr7

By playing the Sicilian you are saying I am ok with being behind in development and in space in the center because I get an extra central pawn and a complicated game. If white plays Bc or Qxd you are still lacking in space and or development just because the engine spits out . doesnt change that or the fact that not a single piece has been traded and theres an entire game of chess to be played both are completely sound tries by white to get a playable middle game and cant be blown off the board or anything. If youre uncomfortable with the resulting positions then Whites opening strategy to get you out of the book and play a game of chess that theyre comfortable with was a success your best bet would be to look at games by strong players in both those lines and see how they handle the positions. ,chess,dbftjsi,2,t5_2qhr7

10356972,0,t3_5o8twj,  for your first few books i recommend the yasser seirawan winning chess collection with the exception of the opening book which is kinda pointless. You should probably start with the tactics book and finish with the brilliances book. After you have that foundation i recommend the following books Practical chess exercices by Ray cheng in my opinion this is the best tactics book for sub  players the puzzles are varied and the solutions are well explained the puzzles are not necessarily tactical he trows some strategical puzzles in there to keep the reader from the mindset which piece do i gloriously sac here also easy and hard puzzles are mixed all of this helps simulate game conditions. simple chess by michael stean there is a book of the same name by John Emms which is inspired in this book i didnt read the emms book but i highly recomend the michael stean book. This is a book on strategy with well chosen examples well written and  that doesnt oversell itself unlike some popular authors like Silman who advertise their strategy books as if they were something revolutionary. Art of Attack in Chess by Vladimir Vukovic simply the best book on the subject. Starting Out d by John Cox this is an opening repertoire book for amateur players that has a revolutionary idea actually recomending main lines! Most repertoire books choose sidelines to restrict the amount of material needed but John argues that you can play mainlines with the same amount of study. He gives enough detail that the reader will understand what is happening but doesnt fload the reader with variations inside variations like most books on mainline openings do. I recommend this book even if you dont play . d since i never found a book on . e with the same kind of approach and quality the starting out  e book is way inferior.  books on specific opening lines that you play. Choose one on the opening that you get most often and one on the opening with which you have the worst results.  Endgames You Must Know by Jesus de la Villa the title says it all. With the exeption of  all the other recommendations can be read in any order. This list was copyed from a previous answer of mine which is why is between quotes.,chess,dci0udu,4,t5_2qhr7

And thus for example the very laws of nature may be more akin to habits that the universe picked up in its early days.As an example of morphic resonance in the fields of human endevor it has been shown that difficult newspaper crosswords are easier to solve in the evening. Why? Because so many people have already solved them earlier in the day thus setting up a morphic pathway for the latercomers to follow.And thus it should be no surprise that basic openings in chess  those which have been played literally s of times every year in history  are the preferred playing pathways for even relatively new first timer beginners to the game.,chess,dcjfuyk,-5,t5_2qhr7

10624542,0,t1_ddbshp0,Here is a description of how AlphaGo functions straight from the horses mouthgt A fast rollout policy p and supervisedlearning SL policy network p are trained to predict human expert moves in a dataset ofpositions. A reinforcement learning RL policy network p is initialised to the SL policy networkand is then improved by policy gradient learning to maximize the outcome i.e. winning moregames against previous versions of the policy network. A new dataset is generated by playinggames of selfplay with the RL policy network. Finally a value network v is trained by regressionto predict the expected outcome i.e. whether the current player wins in positions from the selfplaydataset.I dont see why such techniques could not be applied to chess since none of the above is exclusive to Go nor has it ever been applied to chess at least on that scale before.gt For example of of Alphagos neural networks exists only to identify which area of the board to play in.I scanned through the entire paper and didnt find any reference to anything like that. There are two neural networks a value network which estimates winning probabilities for different candidate moves and a policy network that selects moves based on the value network. The algorithm employs a MonteCarlo Tree Search MCTS not sure if any of the strongest chess engines do so.I dont know why you presuppose that if one were to apply the same techniques to chess it would be done in the most naive fashion possible. That seems a bit ungenerous doesnt it?gt I dont believe I said that I believe this.Well you did dismiss the most state of the art approach to machine learning wrt. game AI as not applicable to chess.,chess,ddbu9nt,3,t5_2qhr7

10685685,0,t1_ddi2vxz,My point which you entirely missed and we were having such a good conversation till you went to the well of ad hominem because I said I was sorry if it SEEMED lazy not that I WAS lazy are you really reading or just failing to comprehend? was that training is the biggest part and ubiquitous talent is not even mentioned in this meta study I started looking at it only that the variance could only be explain by . When you look at the professions its obvious that this would be the only result i.e.  variance by deliberate study since professions are rigidly controlled so everyone must meet the standard of study and practice before gaining certificationaccreditationlicensure but the main point is that THEY are professionals and thus they were already in a highly restricted group that had already achieved mastery. Comparing them to those who failed to be accepted rather than those who are already a success in their field would be more interesting dont you think? Now what other factors are involved? You mention personality but what percentage of the variance is that? What about quality of education going back to professions thats not a trivial matter and where you grow up and who your parents are can play a huge role in your access to education.As for the straw man no that was never the intent but its all part of a package and  of the variance is actually a huge percentage. Show me what other factors account for ? You havent given anything other than conjecture on what else might be at play that even explains close to the number of hours thats not shifting the goal posts thats just asking for a reasonable level of evidence.I will agree on this I do not subscribe to it being the be all and end all read my posts and youll see that is true but it is likely the biggest factor. I am not in a binary argument as you seem to try to paint me in your straw man. My point was always that training is a huge factor and the idea that if you dont have talent you cant reach mastery was wrong.ETA your study points to  of the variance being hours of practice which is more than the meta study showed. It also showed age of initial training is important a factor I would certainly expect in any sport or game and mixed handedness is rather interesting but not necessarily surprising.,chess,ddi5c5y,1,t5_2qhr7

10753283,0,t1_ddp15sb,Thats all good insight.  Thanks for that.I recently had a game where I had over extended my minors in the middle and I moved my queen to a square where it was overloaded so I could try and bait a weak pin out of my opponent.  I suspected they would bite on the pin and I also thought that based on how my opponent had played so far I could really punish them if they went for that pin.  They did and I ended the game about  moves later.  I was black in this game.pgn.e e .f Nc .Nf d .exd Qxd .Nc Qd .fxe Bc .h Bf .Bb Ne .d OO .h Bg .h h .Rh Bxf .Qxf Nxe .Qe Qd I realized I was overextended and tried protecting e while trying to bait Bf .Bf Qf Relieving the pin on e attacking h in the case that he didnt take e and setting up Qf if he did .Bxe Qf .Kd Be .Qxe Qxe .d Qg .Kd Qf  pgnWhere is the balance in that kind of scenario?  I guess where my struggle comes from is analyzing a game against a  rated opponent to better prepare myself for a  opponent.  I was pretty bad in this game but was able to win based solely on mistakes from my opponent.  The best move to beat that particular guy may have cost me a lot of position against an opponent  points higher.,chess,ddp4au5,2,t5_2qhr7

10966913,0,t3_5wja4a,One of the things you should certainly look into is to try taking a detailed look at endgames. Endgames are super important and they are the basis for a lot of winning positions when trying to come up with middlegame plans. They are the most important thing to learn and I mean really learn when it comes to improving chess play. Just to note I know youll find a lot people endorsing tactics. Tactics are good if youre simply trying to improve pattern recognition which to be fair from the few games I looked at you could probably work on it. However pattern recognition isnt magically going to get you good positions. At most it teaches you how to spot opponent mistakes and even then playing where youre reliant on your opponent messing up big time isnt a recipe for long term sustained success. Therefore I will once again point you back to endgames. They will save you from all but certain losses because of knowing when to and when not to trade pieces and will help you win positions youd otherwise never come up with the right plan to exploit the enemy forces. Endgames arent as sexy as tactics but they are supremely important in decision making throughout the opening and middlegame.,chess,deb5rew,3,t5_2qhr7

11083975,0,t1_deo5hfx,Glad that clicked for you.  The OP asked about engineers or musicians but most people cant relate to those.  I had a couple friends in high school that learned guitar and it started with them learning individual notes.  Then slowly they mastered parts of songs.  Eventually they moved on to playing various popular songs.  Each step of learning builds on the next.  I imagine the process for them was very much like learning chess.Another common every day thing that maybe others can relate to aside from math would be learning to drive.  When you first sit behind the wheel you have to learn what all the buttons switches etc. do.  Then you need to figure out the sensitivity of the gas pedal brakes steering wheel.  If you learn to drive a stick you have to deal with the clutch and shifting gears.  I remember how nervous I was about starting on steep hills when I was learning to drive a stick!  You move on to very basic maneuvers driving straight going in reverse parking head in then on to advanced maneuvers like parallel parking.  Eventually you go out on the road and you have to contend with other drivers rules of the road and general awareness checking your mirrors blind spots that idiot flying up on your bumper etc. all while minimizing the amount of mental effort you spend thinking about driving.  After driving for years all of that just fades away and driving feels very simple and natural.  Theres no thought you just do it.It amuses me when chess is portrayed as an activity for geniuses in pop culture.  The smart guy of some showmovie will play a chess game and win to show off how smart they are.  In reality you could take the smartest guy in the world whose never played chess and put him in front of a  player and theyd probably get crushed.  So much of chess is a learned skill.  Sure some people have more natural aptitude and advance quicker but at the end of the day you cant just look at a board and figure it out because youre smart.  Heck computers that process millions of positions a second cant do that.  You need to develop some internal mental algorithm for deciding whats good and whats bad.

Its likely that they want you to see the mate from the game or even a mate that exemplifies the idea.Also be completely honest with yourself. If you had that position in a real game maybe a blitz game would your first move be Kf? I dont think so. Also I looked and Kf looks terrible. Thats just a rook! If black was in zugzwang or something I would understand. THEN after I looked at the position and calculated I double checked with the computer  if only to see this wacky mate in  that starts with Kf  and its not there. I dont know why Kf is indicated I dont know whats going in your picture but its not mate in . Take this as a lesson I guess. Dont trust engines. Literally the LAST thing on your mind during a chess game should be oh whats the engine evaluation.

Blacks first move prevents all those problems with Whites bishop.I then played loads of games in this opening and eventually got good enough at tactics to play ...e without getting destroyed.

You can always revert to ...e when youre more comfortable with seeing threats.Im actually in two minds about posting this comment because I dont want to advocate avoiding learning how to deal with difficulty.

11291023,0,t3_614y72,At your rating you have a lot of room for improvement in every facet of the game. As far as developing your opening I like this article from Chess.com GM Tal Baron also puts it quite nicely to ask yourself Is there a threat? If there isnt how can I improve the position of my worst placed piece? My advice is to understand enough to recognize when certain openings are being played but concentrate your study and play on only one opening at a time first  to  moves in all the variations. Through playing more games youd get a sense of relative strength and weaknesses of each openings development.In the middle game give yourself a goal favorable piece exchanges controlling the center prevent the opposing king from castling etc. and think of ways to accomplish it. When I first started I watched and memorized some GM games and just tried to replicate or reach similar positions in my game. Dont worry too much about losingyoud learn a lot from experimenting and would develop into a much better player. Play chess puzzles lichess training chess.com puzzles chess tempo tactics etc. to learn what to look for and how to exploit your opponents weaknesses. See how you can leverage different pieces in different combinations to achieve different goals.As far as the endgame is concerned master the basic checkmates.  You are already aware of your weakness in this area so shore it up by learning how to use other combination of pieces to win. lichesss practice or chess.coms endgame fundamental drills are a good place to start. Again this article from Chess.com explains some of the fundamentals of the endgame.Finally review your own games even when you win. Find the critical positions i.e. when mistakes were made by yourself or your opponent. Dont just look at your mistakes but also look at ways you could have played better. In the beginning Id recommend that you focus specifically on reviewing your opening play and how you can improve.You can reach  rating if you stay focused and dont get discouraged.,chess,dfbtkjp,5,t5_2qhr7

If Fischer had just come back on his own and decided to have his own world championship minus FIDE in  it would have been more credible. But not playing for  years definitely hurts the legitimacy of his claim. I dont have a problem with considering Fischers  match to be a continuation of his title however which has a certain lineage running from Botvinnik to him. Similar to boxing in which there are multiple such championships. There are perhaps  or  such titles out there Morphys unofficial championship which started and ended with him. Steinitz title which ran from Anderssen and ended with Alekhine. Botvinniks title which ran from him and ended with Fischer.

11380106,0,t3_62e1bb, now started playing i.e. not just knowing the moves when I was .  First games are lost to time but I remember losing to the lowest setting of Chessmaster  the monkey I think. Began actually studying the game some around age . I am  USCF now. Below are some things I remember about the processImproving always felt slow to me. The biggest thing I can remember doing was looking over annotated games from My Great Predecessors and every time there was a question mark after a move I would stop and try and figure out why. I did that over a summer after only playing a couple OTB tourneys. My very next tourney back I jumped from .I hovered right around  for a long time I didnt play rated OTBmuch which was a big contributing factor until another breakthrough occurred when I jumped from  in a single tournament. Why? not exactly sure what the watershed was but a lot of it had to do with one major factor . realizing that most players around  eventually blunder and that even in dead even positions I should play on until it happens and by extension to be very careful to limit the number of collapses myself.  I jumped from  in one tournament about a year later when I realized that not collapsing could only take me so far and that I actually had to work to create chances in the position by employing imbalances and working more on planning rather than not blundering. I remember specifically working through Aagaards GMPrep Positional play just the intro and the next chapter and that really helped me find ways to improve my positions and to plan. Why did all my rating increase come in big jumps? I have no clue maybe I just reach a tipping of the scales and it all clicks at once. Honestly I have always felt like whatever rating I was at that I was over rated. I have never willing played down in a tournament. I have done tons of other work than the above tactics Endgame Openings and maybe the above things just helped to bring all of that together...I also suffer from a pretty bad affliction of I have a better idea and so I know that the above types of study helped me improve but did I get past the first volume of MGP? Nope. How about continuing with the Aagaard Study? Nope. I always mean too but there is always something new something that will make be better faster...My advice Play as much as you can online OTB Blitz Long Time Controls anything and find a way to enjoy studying chess that doesnt include playing I keep telling myself that I will review blitz games and improve but I dont honestly believe it.... Sorry if this post comes across so scattered if you have questions please dont hesitate to ask.,chess,dflwzck,8,t5_2qhr7

11571753,0,t3_655nng,Danny Rensch briefly addressed it on this weeks Titled Tuesday stream. He basically just gave a nonanswer saying that he understands why people are wondering what happened but there wasnt much he could say on the matter.I think its important here to look at the situation from Chess.coms perspective. Its pretty clear that they must have caught him cheating but discussing it publicly could get them into legal trouble. As a GM chess is most likely Dlugys profession so being publicly accused of cheating could be seen as slanderous and could open up the possibility for lawsuits. Since theres no way to prove with  certainty that a player was cheating Chess.com wouldnt want to take something like that to court.Also  being public about these cases would make it easier for people to determine their cheating detection system. The more we know about how players are caught the easier it will be for cheaters to find a way around it.,chess,dg7nx70,25,t5_2qhr7
