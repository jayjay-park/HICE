1363586,0,t3_29ocib,It was a nice promotion and I thought it ran a little longer.  I remember it being some time in early July and usually promotions dont end in the middle of the week.  But I guess the store would be a better source to see if thats still going. It was a pretty sweet deal.  You could trade one towards the other and only pay about  dollars out of pocket if you were buying a One without kinect that is.  I actually got my ps second hand and just traded it towards a brand new one.  Im actually surprised that promotion ran for as long as it did and this far into the life of the new systems.    Edit Apparently its still going Then again if you look at the fine print it says the can just end the promotion whenever so... Also it looks like the base is  for the one with kinect and  without the kinect.  So youre looking at  store credit for the One with Kinect towards a brand new PS.,GameStop,cin7r0e,1,t5_2spz2

I have to reinforce that Im just saying hello.As for your issue Canadas EB Games is a different entity from GameStop is the US so I dont know if any of us regulars in the US are able to properly help. Definitely talk to your DM about this. See if they can be transferred or schedule them with someone you do trust. Require all pocketbag checks to be done by you personally or in view of a security camera. Have them turn out pockets lift the legs of their pants to show socks and lift their arms above their heads so theyre not smuggling in their armpits. If they dont do a check bam! Writeup. Two more to go.See if you can get additional cameras set up in employee areas so you have verifiable proof that they are removing product from the store without payment.Also talk to the suspected people. Not about theft but see if theres anything you can do for them that can help them during this change of management. If they see youre trying they might change their attitude about stealing from you. Its a long shot but sometimes people do change.Thats all Ive got. Good luck with everything!,GameStop,crkw7xw,1,t5_2spz2

But that isnt how the system works because only one item is being sold  Its just like places that limit you to one coupon per personordersale.I agree with others saying to stop looking for the easy way out. Firstly it just cant happen. We can only put one account on a sale even returning the item would still register that account. Theres nothing we can do. It gets offensive when you keep asking for a workaround when we dont have one.If this WERE possible do you realize that one person could have  different accounts and be able to stack the monthly coupons  times? Or big groups like company groups or whatever could all pool their accounts and one person could get items for super cheap? Its just too easy to manipulate so our system just doesnt allow it. Period.If you really want the full values worth just buy two games in separate sales and use a coupon on each one. Thatll get you a full discount.

7251801,0,t3_4epfu4,This is such a great post. I used to work for GameStop a while ago as a GA and back then it was a Hakuna Matata approach Buy Sell Trade Cycle Repeats. It wasnt about how many GPG you got or how many pur memberships you got. It was about encouraging customers to trade in their games and buy our products. It was also about finding the best solution for the customer. I can understand from a business standpoint where this makes sense. But I will  guarentee your bossmanagerdistrict manager helleven anyone in corporate has a Cricket Wireless plan. Obviously they have ATT or Verizonthe best networks. The idea that they take the approach sell  plans today and you wont get reprimanded or fired to their employees is complete and total bull shit. I work in another retail place selling similar services but we are never told Sell  worth of product today or you are finished here because that wouldnt make sense. If GameStop from what I read keeps their shenanigans up by threatening employees badgering customers to drop everything and switch networks and force GPGs and store branded payments systems Credit Card and paid Loyalty programs they are going to fail. They first need to create a need for these services. And PUR Pro is bull shit. Both Amazon and Best Buy offer  off of new games and  off of Preowned. Unless GameStop offered more discounts and better rewards with a reasonable amount of points not like  points for a Mario keychain then I dont see myself switching anytime soon. I hate to break it to you I really do hope Im wrong but with a lot of Game Companies not printing physical copies and offering rewards and discounts buying directly through them I fear GameStop wont survive much longer.,GameStop,d22h7ob,2,t5_2spz2

Additionally the DL should have taken contact information from the survey or otherwise to ensure that this is a onetime thing for that particular person.I totally agree that this facilitates the customer can scream to get money mentality and thats not a good thing to spread.

Its fast paced its a sales job and there are expectations. But to trade on that see what I did there? s you have something in common with almost everyone who walks into your store and very few professions will offer you that. If your goal is to make money avoid GS. Be a bank teller. They pay twice as much and its a super low stress environment. And you wont spend half of every paycheck on a crispy new deposit product. If youre goal is to make friends and support a gaming habit while youre in school theres not much better than Gamestop. I still have customers that I talk to even though Ive moved out of state. It wont help you pay your tuition down but it will let you afford the newest games.

Minus agreeing to getting a GPG because he likes to play frisbee or something with his discs.Im not sure how I could have guided the conversation better but it felt good to have someone complain about process and end up discovering it was the same price as what they wanted by default.,GameStop,de2460f,2,t5_2spz2

I had to have SGA credentials in the system to be able to read email on my own and ring up cricket paymentsactivations for employees.My old DL didnt want me doing any GameStop operational stuff so I basically straightened the storefront until a customer came in and I had to pivot to Cricket.I wasnt supposed use the register unless it involved a cricket transaction either so I almost exclusively worked on the tablet.DCC position was cut from that district a month after I transferred to my current one as an SGA.,GameStop,dg620ua,1,t5_2spz2

11631985,0,t3_65zwog,First thing if youre on PTO you shouldnt answer your phone at all. You need to set the rules that unless the store is burning down or robbed then they need to reach out to stores in your district. You also want to make sure you dont leave any reason for them to call you. Leave notes on tasks that need to be done make sure everyone knows where product is etc. Any time that you are off the clock taking a call needs to be entered in Gotime. ,GameStop,dgehxsv,20,t5_2spz2

11642153,0,t3_6632tx,I understand that autism speaks doesnt speak for everyone on the autism spectrum but my niece has autism and is profoundly mentally disabled. Her IQ is below  and she will need constant care for her life. Autism speaks gives my family peace of mind that they arent alone and they often go to conferences hosted by autism speaks. Autism isnt the same in everyone and we shouldnt demonize people with autism but sometimes its a very profound disability and I feel like thats what autism speaks is about. ,GameStop,dgfngw9,2,t5_2spz2
