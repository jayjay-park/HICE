I dont doubt he struggled with mental disorders but being high for  years may have played into his decline to a great extent. I love Brians work from the s.

I finally broke through my stubborn numbness and allowed myself to grieve following my divorce and the death of my father while listening to King of Limbs for the first time during a long lonely drive at sunset in the middle of nowhere.  I wasnt impressed too much with the album as a whole at first but when Codex started I thought Ooh this is nice.  A minute more into it I was starting to really feel it but when the trumpet does that...thing... at    I had to pull over very quickly.  I wont say I cried like a little kid for half an hour but I sure did stare into space for awhile.  You know how intense sorrow can break through being sad and almost become beautiful after awhile?  This song at that moment did that to me.Incidentally is there anything about that trumpet riff that can be explained musically? I love how it builds up and tapers off like that.  Is there a name for that?,LetsTalkMusic,ceilvpp,7,t5_2t4it

90707,0,t3_1v3bb9,Ill offer my take on this from a musicians perspective.  The thing to keep in mind is that even if someone is depressed they will still have moments where they feel on top of the world.  If they create in those moments then those are the feelings that will come out in the songs.  Id say thats actually more common.  Artists are much more likely to be inspired while in a rare mood rather than a common one.  Other than the lyrics for the most part many artists view musical structure as a set of tools.  It is totally possible to write a melody and chord structure that creates a certain mood or feeling based purely music theory.  This can be completely separate from what is actually being felt at that moment.  While this may not inspire artists to come up with ideas it helps a lot in finishing and polishing ideas and turn them into songs.  ,LetsTalkMusic,ceor7zz,14,t5_2t4it

137242,0,t1_ceu111v,I think thats a fairly spoton analysis. There are some oddball songs on Flood Hot Cha comes to mind but every track is very singable. Even the lesserknown songs have really interesting lyrical tracks and when I listen to Flood its hard not to sing along. All of their other albums have at least two or three tracks that I just end up skipping a problem that gets a lot worse right around the release of John Henry and doesnt stop probably until The Spine. The sheer listenability of each song makes Flood fairly distinct.,LetsTalkMusic,ceu28mp,1,t5_2t4it
156895,0,t3_1vvjk6,Only if I feel obliged to listen to everything that is recommended sent to me or being talked about a lot within the styles I listen to.    Sometimes I do feel like this but Ive got better at not feeling guilty if I limit what I listen to. I can fit around four to six hours of listening into each day.     I suppose I make a bit of room for myself in that I rarely listen to anything  greater than about ten to  years old other than to check historically. As much as I loved music of and at the time I love following its evolution more. So rather than put on The Smiths or Guadalcanal Diary or Dinosaur Jr. or R.E.M. or Pink Floyd or Fugazi I will listen to something new or recent.    I need time for current favourites  normally a pool of about  records. I dont listen to individual songs  only full albums or EPs unless I have to cut them short. This will take up to a couple of hours a day. This is really important to me because its what Im connecting with most at that time.    This then leaves time for perhaps two or three other records a day at a total of around  to  minutes. Some of these will be first or second listen or they could be something Im reviewing in which case that will need five to ten listens in the week.    So yes I miss out on lots of records I am very likely to enjoy and I look at my hard drive often and see all these records Ive boughtdownloaded on bandcamp and wonder what on earth they sound like because I cant remember or never got to listen to them. But I dont feel Im missing out because I get to hear so much good stuff anyway.

227560,0,t3_1wp0xf,As a classicallytrained musician metalhead and lover of music it is difficult for me to narrow my music listening down to one song but I will take a stab at it.Wintersun  StarchildWintersun is one of those bands thats hard to describe what they play because their music has so many different elements to it. In my opinion this is the beauty of the band. If you watered it them down you could say they are symphonic powerdeath metal yes I just made that up. Reducing Wintersun to that minute subsubgenre would be a travesty in my opinion because there is so much more to it. This particular song  could be described as symphonicprogspacefolkvikingmelodicpowerdeath metal.The musical ability of the band is selfevident due to the usage of nonstandard time signatures syncopations modulations and instrumental lines.I enjoy the musical complexity but am by no means one of those progelitists.A big reason why I like this song is the juxtaposition of the melodic clean and the pitchless dirty vocals. While the dirty vocals used are closer to typical black metal vocals than death metal vocals I think it is more appropriate within the context of the rest of the song. Another major reason why this song encompasses my listening habits is the lyrical content. The lyrics are storybased. This is in common with a lot of classic rock oldies protometal classic metal power metal and folk metal. The death aspect of the lyrics is common in lots of extreme metal which Ive listened to a lot of lately.As far as defending the song I think its something you like or you dont particularly with the harsh vocals. It can be perceived as a bit nerdy and maybe a bit eccentric in some circles. I feel that people who dont like the song have more or less made their mind up and you cant really persuade them.,LetsTalkMusic,cf4c1pw,5,t5_2t4it

This is good stuff very clever use of production to create interesting soundscapes I especially like when you can hear little snatches of electric piano  check my flair. Its like an addictive drug to me. Love that sort of touch. Its an album chockfull of interesting details. It ends on a cool cover of Larks Tongues in Aspic pt  which just shits all over Dream Theaters relatively lifeless and overly technical if there is such a thing in approaching King Crimson version. Really what makes the album so good for me is the drumming. Its highly energetic and best of all jazzy. Genuinely jazzy too Im reminded of Art Blakey in how this drummer uses the highhat or even Colm OCiosoig when he does his fills that almost go out of time. Whats more they dont sound tinny and awful and the blastbeats blast properly instead of pattering annoyingly over the top of the mix.Water from WaterSharks Lungs In PlasticMAST  OmniThis guy was on FlyLos Brainfeeder label for a while I think and I can definitely hear some comparisons. But far from being derivative I think this guy mostly shares a similar philosophy. This album is experimental instrumental hiphop with influences from freejazz to ambient music but honestly its not as dry as those labels make it sound. It has a good grasp of melody that grips you and has a strong sense of atmosphere. Until You Are Sound feat. RYATThe Waters feat. Jeremiah Jae the electric piano on this  just hnnnnnghShanren  Left Foot Dance of the YiThe good thing about the Guardian app on Spotify is that you occasionally get pointed towards some weird stuff.

469794,0,t3_1zgbd2,All it really means is you hear a song and you immediately think s or mid s or whatever. There are definitely trends in music and they dont always age well. Think gated reverb on drums or deep chorus on guitar or the west coast whine in hiphop.Dated can be a negative thing but it doesnt necessarily make music bad. If theres enough substance behind the gimmicks it can even add to the music by todays standards Kraftwerk was using very primitive electronic instruments but it works with their sound and aesthetic.If there isnt substance behind the gimmicks then the music ages poorly. Ill use a nonmusical example.

567238,0,t3_20md1s,Been on a massive Big Star kick after checking out Nothing Can Hurt Me on Netflix a couple months back. Ive always been a fan but recently Ive become somewhat of a Big Star junkie. Their first two albums are veritable masterpieces. The production is flawless the songwriting impeccable and increasingly rewarding with repeat listens. I love how each album starts with boxing gloves on and eventually deconstructs into this hesitant beautiful sad contemplation on what all has just happened. Almost like that bittersweet feeling of seeing the sunrise after an all night rager and realizing youve got nothing left in the tank.Its also interesting that with each successive album they were working with one less founding member. GuitaristVocalist Chris Bell split between  Record and Radio City which speaks to Radio Citys decidedly more introspective tone. And Bassist Andy Hummel split between Radio City and rd leaving just drummer Jody Stephens and the genius Alex Chilton and a revolving cast of players plus the incomparable Jim Dickinson producing and playing everything that Alex was too drunk to figure out. rd was described by Stephens and Dickinson as more of a Chilton experiment that was slapped with the Big Star moniker for label reasons and its various stages of existence make it the foster child of the Big Star canon. But if you ignore the shambolic early s Rykodisc reissue and check it out in its original PVC track order I highly recommend just buying this if you have a turntable  it sounds incredible this is arguably one of the most honest beautiful telling albums about what its like to be a master of your craft considered by many to be the best at what you do and constantly left standing at the threshold watching others pass by you. It ends with the repeated lyric Thank you friends for making this all so probable. But never quite possible. Sad stuff.Cant sing their praises enough.

792171,0,t1_cgua2z1,I think its hard for die hard fans to move on at times. I know I have. Its really a doubleedged sword. If you keep cranking out similar stuff you get accused of pandering to the keep the older fans happy. You as an artist are older and maybe write from a different perspective in life and may want to try something different musically you get accused of either being too experimental or trendy and not giving the fans what they want. I will have to say I dont envy musicians that have lasted a few decades its hard to please everyone and I am sure its even harder to recapture the adulation and admiration of yesteryear as well. With that being said Ive never been able to buy tickets in the past due to them selling out almost immediately.

It made a huge impact on me and I would listen to it regularly. So that is the piece I chose for my conducting class. I got to conduct the nd movement with a full symphony orchestra! It was amazing! I listened to that symphony so many times. It just got better and better the more I studied and read the score while listening to it. It really is amazing just to watch the melody while listening to a piece even if you have never tried before. I would encourage you too. The graphic illustrations on youtube are pretty cool too.  My other favorite Bethoven is The moonlight sonata. I love the first movement but the other two are overlooked by most people. The third movement specifically. It is soooo good. Beethoven was was a major reason the romantic era came. He kind of ushered in the move to more emotional music.  You should get into Chopin. My all time favorite composer.  Nocturne Op.

Theres also a melancholic beauty to many of the tracks like Andro and Replica.

Every genre is its own beast to an extent. If youre trying to get into a new genre of music that youve never really experienced before it might take time to get used to. I dont think that listening to rock music your whole life will keep you from being able to get into jazz if you want to.

It was most certainly not meant to be taken seriously and I know they never expected the kind of attention it gathered.

1313045,0,t3_292l0h,Drake Bell  Ready Steady Go!Now I know what you must be thinking is this the same Drake Bell from Drake and Josh and all I have to say is yes yes it is. It is also quite different from what he was doing around  years ago. He has gone from making a bubblegumpoprock album into a more rockabillyswingrock. It sounds to me like it is a blues influenced rock album. For me the sound and energy is what does it. Yes the lyrics are quite obvious and cliched. Yes the songs sound like the could be pulled straight from a country record but for some reason I have more interest in this album than I do anything that is playing on my local country stations. There is a sort of energy I am hearing in this album that sound genuine and like he is actually having fun recording these songs. It could be just a naive energy but it is still there. Jesus Christ this song just makes me want to dance even though the lyrics are some of the most obvious ones in the whole album.The one glaring flaw that I cannot get over is that most of these songs are covers of other rock and roll hits. I wish that the album would have been more original material than it is currently from what I see there are three songs that have Drake Bell on the credits which signals to me that they are originals. Though I understand that this album more than anything is a way for him to get his feet wet in this style and to establish his name as one that should be listened to and that he is not the same artist he used to be.Bitchcraft  One of the originals on the album and is one of the more fun songs. Definitely has some young lyrics but still a solid trackSunny Afternoon to  if you are using RES the time link isnt working if you open up the video in the comment  Best version I could find.

1407013,0,t3_2a8m8z,A Sunny Day in Glasgow  Sea When Absent  Bye Bye Big OceanI have been listening to this album incessantly over the last couple of weeks since its release.  A lot of the album defies genre descriptors but my best approximation is that it is shoegazedream pop with a harder edge louder percussion and slightly more defined guitar work.  The band  led by dual lead singing women with soaring beautiful voices  excels most in creating walls of sound eschewing the types of typical song structures that Ive come to expect.  The songs build and develop in intriguing ways with the almost unintelligible vocals intertwining with frenetic guitar work and crashing cymbals. Its very epic music but at the same time it doesnt seem epic for the sake of being epic like so much other stuff being released these days. Its pretty to listen to in the same way that a storm is pretty to watch slightly foreboding and threatening but still aweinspiring.  Its going to stick with me for a while.  Anais Mitchell  HadestownHey Little Songbird ft. Greg Brown  Wait For Me ft. Justin Vernon and Ben Knox MillerThis has been a favorite of mine for a couple of years now but Ive really been getting into it again recently.  If you havent heard about this Anais Mitchell composed a folk opera telling the story of Orpheus and Eurydice but set in a sort of postapocalyptic desolate environment.  Its got vocal parts sung by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver Ben Knox Miller of The Low Anthem Greg Brown amazing deep voice as Hades and several other talented singers including Anais herself in a leading role.  The storytelling is fascinating the music beautiful and tragic at times.  The songs vary greatly but the narrative and the vocal work help to tie together different stylistic choices.

1488808,0,t1_cj2rojz,I think another issue that is relatively new in regard to the running time time of theme songs is the fact that it has become very common for people to watch multiple episodes of the same show consecutively thanks to Netflix and DVDbluray sets. When you watch  episodes of a sitcom in a row the the repetition of the theme songs become tedious and aggravating. Ive notived that a lot of shows have a long and short version of their themes. Sometimes when episodes air live the first time they use the long version but video ondemand may have the short version. Some shows use the long version in the first season but shorten it for later seasons giving them an extra  seconds of space to fill in with plot or more jokes. In general the trend seems to be toward shorter intros but there are of course some exceptions like Game Of Thrones that seems to go for  minutes. But Ive been watching a lot of older sitcoms and dramas and it seems like all those old shows had intros that were extremely long.

Im sure it applies to most fans who are overly vocal about anything but damn if the Dave Grohl fans arent some of the most obnoxious fans Ive ever encountered. I have nothing but respect for Dave Nirvana and even the Foos despite the fact that I agree with OP in thinking they are a bit boring but if you go on any Nirvana or Foo youtube videos youll find the worst rlewronggeneration type BS Ive ever seen. They dont listen to anything but classic rock and cant seem to tell the difference in quality between a band like Zeppelin and a band like Styx. Its like as long as they are rock they are good. The worst was at the recent Nirvana hall of fame thing where they had female singers to do Kurts bits. The one for St. Vincent has comments that suggest that she only was invited because she is sleeping with Dave Grohl. Further there were comments that she was a bad guitar player. Total insanity instead of looking up who she was and seeing her credentials a much more technically skilled player than Kurt for sure. they just jump on this whole shes not punk enough Kurt would have hated this shes probably just sleeping with Daverecord people its disgusting.

Bingo categories for everything.  Recently there was an article in the New Yorker about Ithkuil an idealized language whose aim is the highest possible degree of logic efficiency detail and accuracy in cognitive expression via spoken human language while minimizing the ambiguity vagueness illogic redundancy polysemy multiple meanings and overall arbitrariness that is seemingly ubiquitous in natural human language.

An underrated classic. Another hip hop record Id recommend is Atmospheres God Loves Ugly an angry dark yet still emotional in an almost punk sense effort from Ant amp Slug.

2010975,0,t3_2hr9vh,I was  years old and in college when this album came out. A clear rock fan who has slowly painfully weathered the past decade and a half as music continues to get worse and worse in my opinion.I just sat down and listened to it for the first time.Oh I knew about it Ive definitely heard of The Strokes have a general idea about their sound recognized the album by title and cover... the whole deal but I never actually heard it or knew anyone else who owned it. Radio was more or less dead by that point and there were never any circumstances where I would have listened to it. It seemed more than anything like something that just sort of existed rather than an album that was necessary or relevant. Pop music from the era before it was just a combination of dance music and hiphop.Either way maybe I should finally take the plunge. Rdio has it and while I dislike lowquality streamed music it should at least give me a good idea.So thoughts? Eh... it was OK. Nothing incredible or notable really. I dont feel like Ive been missing anything and have no urge or desire to pick the CD up or ever really listen to it again.  It leaves no real impression and just sort of fades into the background as one song segues almost imperceptibly into the next. Its inoffensive and just sort of... there. I dont think Id even really call it a rock record.So yeah I was there at the time not just some disaffected recent youth without the context to appreciate the time and place it was released into. Even beyond that as someone raised on classic rock radio s garage rock and punk and s altrock I was absolutely the target audience and... just nothing. ,LetsTalkMusic,ckvipiz,-5,t5_2t4it

2063903,0,t3_2ifqj0,This album was an eye opener for me. Coming from Ireland I didnt have much to relate to in hip hop or rap but Mike Skinner did something different for me when I found his music. It was much more honest and down to earth than a lot of music I had been introduced to previously.The album Original Pirate Material spoke to me hard. When it came out I was a typical stoner just sitting in my bedroom listening to music a lot and everything he rapped about was so relatable at that point.Now that Im older and look back on listening to that album as a teen I feel like a lot of the views and opinions expressed on it have taken a subconscious effect.AGDCFF is so well written.

2109468,0,t3_2j1rsv,Yanni for me is background music and that is an odd category for me.  In a sense music that fills the background while you attend to something else ought not be all the great and perhaps shouldnt really have rough edges or attention grabbing aspects.  Yet I find that I can easily categorize background music on a good ltgt bad continuum.  A lot of Brian Enos ambient stuff I consider good but a lot of the electronic ambient stuff of the s and s especially the stuff that evolved out of the EDM of that era I find to be too boring to be good.  However in the case of Enos ambient work my attention slips from it and it becomes background music.  What is the criterion that I use to separate unobtrusive and pleasant music from unobtrusive and unpleasant music?  One would think that nonattention grabbing music would be inherently bad and yet a certain subset of that genre actually works for me.If I was in an elevator and Yanni was playing I would not be pissed off in the least.  And at the same time I would never deliberately chose to purchase a Yanni album.Sorry uerrordog that Yanni isnt feeling too much love in this thread.  I have been there before.

2113395,0,t3_2j3s88,While I love Sabbath with Ozzy I find Sabbath with Dio to be more metal. Now I know you cant get more metal than Ozzy and Sabbath but the hardness just isnt on the later Sabbath products. Given the time the music was recorded Heaven and Hell I think more so Mob Rules just freaking shredded. Look at what Sabbath was on Never Say Die! a popmetal band struggling to win Foreigner fans. Dio came on board and they moved away from that sound into a darker harder sound. Lyrically the album kind of goes back to move forwardethereal lyrics that paint a dark picture and fit Dios voice well.I remember being a kid and seeing this album at stores the cover was so badass that it scared me. Just the Sabbath name was usually enough to do that but with the black background and angel figures its all religiony and thus more creepy to me. Never Say Die and Technical Ecstasy was both colorful covers which took away the scariness.  ,LetsTalkMusic,cl8ght9,3,t5_2t4it

Needless to say young me who hadnt discovered industrial music yet was terrified and confused. After letting it grow on me though Ive come to terms with the fact that Suicide is a highly thoughtprovoking and badass album. It doesnt need quick drum playing  second songs or tremolopicked power chords. All it needs is fucked lyrics horrific vocal performances and one simple synth line. And the most fascinating thing about it is that you can hear echoes of Suicide in music nearly  years later!

The songs on this album are given more room to breathe the longest song on Old Wounds is just over five minutes while Youth has several songs that reach past the six minute mark.

2466097,0,t1_cmgfo5b,Good points.    I think if you use the words Reunion Tour then people are not going to expect anything new. When TOOL tour you dont go expecting to hear new stuff you possibly hope you might and when J Mascis performs its old stuff and some new stuff which sounds just like the old stuff.   I often think of the crowds at these reunionreformation shows as like this Now Im not saying its objectively bad but the reason most go to reunion shows is to relive an earlier time. Personally Im not into reformation shows and dont listen to much old music at all but I can see the appeal. Many bands coming back after a hiatus or from the dead are finding it better to play one of their albums in its entirety plus some other hits.     If you said you were going to play lots of new stuff but didnt then you should expect a negative response but I dont know of any examples of that. I do know a lot of people who went to see Bob Dylan and thought he was shit but that was about people building a romantic expectation in their minds and not reading any reviews of his shows.    In any case every show I see as part of an album release gets much bigger response for the old stuff than the stuff off the new album. When Ben Ottewell Gomez played here a couple of weeks ago he got a good laugh when he said words to the effect of Im going to play the single off my new album. Im sure youve all heard it on all the radio stations. You probably know all the words and youll probably all sing along. I like those moments when an artist just says to the crowd OK I know whats going on here guys I understand the dynamics after ten years of doing this and Im OK with it. But Im getting distracted!    If talk was that a reunion tour signalled a new album but there was to be no new album and the band failed to address that in interviews and Im sure someone doing an interview with them would ask the question then yes that would be shit and people are right to be pissed off.    There was a big stink here in Australia when John Farnham who most Australians loved had a tour called The Last Time Tour. It was called that because that was the name of his album and that came from the name of a song. Now I dont know whether the record company suggested using that name as the album and tour name because it would make people think it was a farewell tour but that is what people thought. He did say he would give up largescale touring but many obviously thought that meant no more shows ever. He clarified that many times in interviews but damage had been done. One punter then decided to sue Farnham when he performed again but I reckon that was spurious especially since he got his ticket after Farnham had clarified things  the fan lost his attempt.    So yeah try one on and you get a backlash. Be upfront and I see no ethical problem with a reunion tour that has no new material coming out of it.,LetsTalkMusic,cmgid8x,2,t5_2t4it

2547552,0,t3_2ov9r5,Goin all HipHop on this one.JLive  Around the Sun link JLive has been in the rap game for almost  decades now. Hes from New York but lives in Atlanta now. He famously had his first album this was in  delayed for  years because of industry bullshit. I think JLive has a great voice flow and is good at writing songs and saying what he wants to without coming off as preachy or too stuck in the past. The only old man moment he has is Not Listening but Ive heard far worse. I also enjoyed the production it really reminds me of Pete Rock. Its definitely worth a few listens if you like s HipHop. Allan Kingdom  Future Memoirs link Allan Kingdom is a rapper from Minnesota hes relatively new on the scene. This project is mostly self produced but there are a couple of production collaborations with Plain Pat and a few others. The production is what has kept me coming back to this over the last week. I think he manages to sound weirdoff kilter without being grating at all. I find that to enjoy a rap album I have to enjoy the production. Once that initial hurdle crossed it takes a lot to make me not want to listen to a rapper. Allan Kingdom doesnt do anything to make me not want to come back but I feel like hes still finding his voice. His rap style doesnt really put a lot of stress on storytelling which Id like to see more of.Big K.R.I.T.  Cadillactica link In some ways this felt like a step back for Big K.R.I.T. to me. It was just flashy and grandiose in a way I didnt like. Like the moment on Life where the drums are booming and theres a chorus of voices going ohhhhh it just feels too climaxy for me I had the same problems on Saturdays  Celebration. On Pay Attention I like the song until the RampB radio hook comes in. On Do You Love Me the his car asks him if he loves her in a way that also felt corny. I just dont like the song concept on Angels. I feel like the highlights are the songs where Big K.R.I.T. does the usual southern rap song with his fast flow like My Sub part  Cadillactica or Soul Food. I also liked the slower traditional southern rap numbers like King of the South and Mo Better Cool. Also if K.R.I.T. made an EP or album of spoken word stuff like Standby Id probably listen to that a lot. ,LetsTalkMusic,cmr3oiq,3,t5_2t4it

2733140,0,t1_cnc6z8y,I have to seriously disagree with uSwamp. Most of the time Kanye is just a terrible singer. He has a very nice quality to his voice but he just cant hit the notes. There are a few exceptions like Runaway but he uses autotune because he cant sing for the most time.Autotune doesnt normally sound the way it does when Kanye uses it. I believe the South Park guys when recording Gay Fish mentioned that you have to sing really badly to get it to sound like that. I dont like the autotune but it sadly is typically the better option for Kanye. On My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy he was much more tasteful on when to and when not to use it and thus we get some tracks like Runaway which I imagine took many takes to get right and tracks like Hell of a Life which sound pretty good with Autotune. I havent listened to Yeezus yet so I cant speak to that.s and Heartbreak is almost all autotune and some of it is worse than others.I dont blame Kanye for using autotune though.

3012701,0,t1_coa6yjs,gt  People of the year  may be hard pressed to understand why the dad rock era skipped a decade and why some bands are clearly part of it and others are completely excluded.I think its as simple as some bands are not only popular but perceived as good. So you have plenty of popular bands from the same era but the dadrockers dont like them because they dont bring the same name recognition and theyre often considered dated or heavily of their time. The Velvet Underground Beefheart and Can dont carry any widespread name recognition while Emerson Lake and Palmer Supertramp and Ted Nugent carry a huge stigma with their name recognition.This is why I think the s are generally skipped it had plenty of greats bands but how many of those were popular? So your choice is either dodgy new wave bands that were dated within a few years or the heavily loathed hair metal. Guns N Roses is probably the only band from that era to ascend to dadrock status.,LetsTalkMusic,coa9j9w,12,t5_2t4it

3214093,0,t3_2wx4yq,Your initial question I think is something that is highly subjective. Two people could listen to the same album for the first time and come to entirely opposite conclusions on whether the first or latter half is better or even if they liked it in the first place. I think the issue at the heart of this though is whether the artist or producer or whomever considers the album as a whole musical work or as a collection of individual songs that were all ready to be released at the same time. That is does the album have a sense of direction in its construction or is it just a track list? I think this also reflects on how diverse the artists music is. Are all their songs bpm in  time with the volume turned up to ? Fine theres a market for that. In my opinion that makes for a somewhat boring overall album though even if each song individually is good. Do they instead have a variety of types of songs? If well arranged this can give the album that sense of direction that makes for a more dynamic listening experience. As I said at the beginning though I think its subjective.,LetsTalkMusic,cov54ft,1,t5_2t4it

I really enjoyed this album however and found it to be one of the best things Ive heard from this year however. Looking forward to its release to see reviewers opinions of this one since opinions have been incredibly polarizing online.Current   Thunder Perfect MindListened to lots of C lately since it was about time I got accustomed to their music. Planning on going through some of their most well known stuff this week. Thunder Perfect Mind was a bit long but still very interesting. I love the atmosphere even if I so far prefer the industrial stuff over the folkier.The Pop Group  Citizen ZombieI thought it was an above average album but void of everything that made Y a postpunk masterpiece. I get that its been over  years since their last release and it might be unfair to compare the two but I still find this one to be a bit disappointing. I wish it had atleast been as funky as Y but as it is now I see no point in returning to it for the sole reason that it doesnt do anything that I cant find in a better record. I do like the vocals though.And the rest...Ten Love Songs  Havent listened to Susanne Sundfor but after this one I feel like I ought to hear more. Very enjoyable unique pop record.The Lonesome Crowded West  Never been big on Modest Mouse but I enjoy this one atleast. Has some of their in my opinion best singles. Heretic Pride  Not very interesting.Black Moon Days  Another very good  release. Dean Blunt collaborator record sounds like Grouper.Aesthethica  Really suffers from muddy mixing.

Luckily for me Beck seems to produce music that gets through to me one way or another. Listening to the album at work now Id agree that the st half of the album is somewhat stronger than the nd half.Id say that as a body of work it was going to be tricky being the album after Odelay which was so big worldwide that MV will always be compared to it. This is unfair as the album has some very good moments.

3359444,0,t3_2ymiy3,I go on and off with vinyl but I do like it for a few reasons. The first being that Ive always preferred having a piece of physical media both with music as well as movies and books. It makes it seem more substantial to me somehow. Listening to old records on vinyl is pretty cool too as you get a better sense of how the album was constructed. Exile on Main St. is a great example of this. When you listen to the record you can really hear how each side has its own feel to it. More so than when you listen to it on iTunes.But I more than anything I like it because I find that the tiny bit of extra effort it takes to put a record on makes it so I listen more intently. Its easy to just click a song on iTunes and zone out while surfing the web. Putting on a record though you have to make a small but concerted effort to take it out of the sleeve put it in the player and find the right point in the groove to make it start where you want it to.

3526481,0,t3_3067w1,In my job we can all have on headphones for the majority of the day and weve all been there  years. Do the math weve listened to a ton of music.         Initially there was a honeymoon period where we were dropping off flash drives to one another almost daily and discussing albums. Sometimes we even got together and played music since many of us played instruments.         Eventually a sort of fatigue set in. I couldnt keep up with the albums. They were bleeding together and when someone would refer to a band I would know the name and I had probably listened to an album a couple times but it wasnt getting catalogued in my brain. In short information overload.        I also felt like there was some hipsterism or at least egoism among us in trying to be bringing forth good but unknown bands to one another. Perhaps a turning point happened when a friend asked if I had heard of bandname and I sarcastically replied No but Ill let you know when I do. I was done with the orgy.        Now if I find something I like I chew on it for awhile. Weeks months maybe. Ive gone from being a musical chainsmoker to someone who occasinally enjoys a fine cigar.

3600032,0,t3_31iedl,Thats kind of an interesting point. There hasnt really been an album that defines a new flavor or direction in rock music and there hasnt been a rock album that defines the generation we live in.Hell the best candidate for the latter would be The Dismemberment Plans Emergency and I which I firmly believe was sent back in the past and released ten years too early. The way it talks about isolation and connection seems so clearly twentyfirst century that its hard to believe it existed before the advent of the social network. Perhaps the closest an album actually released in the aughts is that the preferred nomenclature? came to feeling like an album about the aughts was LCD Soundsystems Sound of Silver a fundamentally postpunk record made with modern electronic grooves.That album however committed a number of cardinal sins against popularity including having  minute singles a lead vocalist  years of age and kind of a mixed bag in the way of accessibility I had to give it a number of listens before anything other than Someone Great clicked.So what exactly are we looking for in a decadegenre defining album? Well I can come up with a rough list of stuff not to look for.  Dont do lofi. Theres a reason why Nevermind is remembered over In Utero and I honestly dont believe its songwriting quality. Anything thats recorded in anything short of a professional studio has a ceiling of cult classic. Im looking at you Pavement.  Dont do a single existing genre really really well. These albums will be acclaimed on release and then slowly forgotten.  Dont do exactly what this thread is doing right now. Naming a generation defining album when the generation is currently in progress doesnt make a whole lot of sense. Modern and postmodern are both labels which we put on art later after the movements had already happened.To expand on that thought the folksy chamberpop sound of indie rock in the aughts has fallen into the wildly irresponsible hands of mainstream rock. In judging albums like Funeral or say Illinois now our perception is colored by the fact that theres a lot of soundalike stuff floating around Lumineers Of Monsters and Men that somehow dilutes the originals. Without doubt in another ten years well be able to point out some clear Nevermind kind of a weird metaphor personally I never really got into grunge some clear Slanted and Enchanted and some clear I dunno Pinkerton ? for this current generation. Time will do its thing the albums that age well will stick around in the musical canon whereas those that dont will simply be forgotten. Somell age like Titanic othersll age like Saving Private Ryan. Thats just how it is.That of course applies also to hip hop. Remember Oasis Be Here Now was a spectacular album per initial reviews.Disclaimer I havent gotten through TPAB yet but so far its been just pretty good. It sounds like itll need a second listenthrough at least.EDIT TPAB is pretty pretty good. But I still feel like the overarching narrative rather than the strength of the songs is whats pushing it into genredefining territory.,LetsTalkMusic,cq2moej,6,t5_2t4it

3629709,0,t3_31u197,I think its probably my favourite album of theirs Ive heard the selftitled being the only one I havent heard. I love the addition of primal drum sounds in this album its something that Ive always adored  since Ive started my journey of exploring music from the past and present extensively.Full Of Fire is definitely the first song that really catches my ear the way that the track just continually builds off of this simple beat that is established at the beginning is amazing to me. Without You My Life Would Be Boring is the most immediate song on the album full of beautiful tribal drums and a catchy synth line. Wrap Your Arms Around Me is maybe my favourite song as it combines a pretty bleak and dark sound with lyrics that just scream sexy.The two short tracks Crake and Oryx are pretty throwaway to me. The midpoint Old Dreams Waiting to be Realised is definitely a song I wouldnt listen to of my own accord but as a middle point for the album it works very well. Its a great ambient interlude between the constant noise the album brings and its just as experimental as the rest of the material.The second half brings a slightly more linear style of songs than the first half there arent any catchy tracks like WYMLWBB or WYAAM. These songs are still fantastic like Raging Lung  and Stay Out Here are intoxicating with their repetition and the melodies that theyre singing. I really appreciate this album for being unlike anything Ive heard in the genre before challenging their fans and just being a collection of fantastic songs that continue to reveal more and more to me as I listen to them. Even the experimental songs like Cherry on Top and Fracking Fluid Injection work well into the album as a whole and I enjoy them just as much as the rest for their uniqueness.,LetsTalkMusic,cq60jgg,2,t5_2t4it

3692294,0,t3_32ootx,Ill respond to your wall of text with a wall of text. The U Talkin U To Me? podcast reignited my love of U but be warned its mostly  guys Scott Aukerman and Adam Scott fucking around. I had not really listened to U since All That You cant Leave Behind. The  albums after that were mediocre at best. Their latest Songs of Innocence is a really good album though. Bono is writing very personal stuff about his past and the music sounds fresh while taking cues from their early days and influences Joy Division The Clash etc.. They can still write great songs. Theyve faded out of cultural relevance but are still one of the biggest musical acts in the world. You cant stay relevant forever. It would be unnatural.Its amazing how many changes and eras theyve gone through. They make a good point on that podcast how U finds a new sound and its great but then they beat it to death over the course of like  albums and people get sick of them. So like their first era from Boy to Joshua Tree was a nice progression but people got sick of their pretension with Rattle and Hum. They went away and came back with a new sound with Achtung Baby but then beat that sound to death by the time Pop came around. Again they went away and came back with All That You Cant Leave Behind and proceeded to fade into mediocrity by No Line on the Horizon. So I guess you can look at Songs of Innocence as the beginning of another era but I dont know how many albums they have left in them. Theyre never satisfied with just making a good album it seems. They always want to go BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER!!!! They obviously cant do that anymore at this point in their career from a cultural standpoint. All we can hope is that they keep making good music.As a child of the s and s I have very fond memories of listening to U but I was never a huge fan. The album that sticks with me is All That You Cant Leave Behind because it came out in a very transitional part of my life. I had just started going out with my wife was trying to establish my career and of course  happened a year after it came out. Ill always associate Walk On with that. My wife and I were watching the Beautiful Day video when we had our first kiss. Sorry Im getting really personal and off track here.All that being said I dont think well see a band like them again in terms of huge they are. The gigantic rock act seems to be dead. Ive only seen them live once but it was probably the best live show Ive seen. It was like a spiritual experience. Not many bands can conjure up that kind of thing.,LetsTalkMusic,cqd5961,16,t5_2t4it

People that think their entire catalog is radio friendly rock are probably only familiar with their singles which SHOCKING are radio friendly rock. From their first album to Colour and Shape to TINLTL they were a very diverse band. Moving around from really grungey to classic americana to pretty straightforward chord progression rock. Nothing super technical or experimental but certainly not a single sound identity. Granted as time has gone on its easy to look at each new song and tie it back to an earlier sound.

Colin Stetson Sarah Neufeld  Never Were The Way She WasVery accessible experimental music I recommend this highly to anyone looking for some cool instrumental music with imagination and emotion. Colin is a mainstay of bands like Arcade Fire and Bon Iver when they tour but has managed in his solo career to far surpass anything they have ever made. Basically he uses every physical trick in the book to make his baritone sax create strange sounds harmonies and long repetitive melismata. Part of the magic is the actual sound of the effort involved. Here he brings in the violinist Sarah Neufeld who adds some very welcome scrapes and drones.

4022066,0,t3_36j97g,Its tough to quantify something like this but I think most of it can be attributed to marketing and timing assuming you call the right shots. When youre a new band every new release is like a coin flip. Massive success has to be like hitting heads x in a row. So much has to go right.Then theres some bands like The Flaming Lips Butthole Surfers and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones who are more resilient than their peers and stick around long enough to get their lucky break. I think some near misses areUrge Overkill  Had some minor hits but not as ubiquitous as their contemporariesJosh Kelley  Had the looks had the sound but sounded too much like John Mayer.VV Brown  Had the soul to be a huge star but she gave up on her followup and pop music altogether. There are several other acts that got swept away with major sea changes within the genre. Pop rock acts left behind with grunge. Ska bands were onehit wonders when nu metal and indie rock surfaced. Emo bands that nosedived when their genre became a parody of itself.

4089970,0,t3_37gllj,Long Fin KillieOne of the rare bands for whom postrock is the best descriptor available. Sounds somewhat close to Bark Psychosis but much more energetic mixing in dubby bass jazz instrumentation to the point of sounding dnb shoegaze along with heavy bits of violin usage. They can also be a bit frustrating in the vocal and lyric department the singer has a Morrisseylike tendency to come off as though hes written a paragraph of text and is singing regardless of meter and with some rather iffy lyrics Ive got a flair for porno?! I cant really imagine a different style vocalist though perhaps just better lyrics wouldve worked. Houdini is the more relaxed oceanic album while Valentino is a bit more guitarheavy and aggressive. Very good stuff. Love Smothers Allergy Valentino Heads of Dead Surfers ft. Mark E Smith Hands and LipsCirclePharaoh OverlordTwo different projects that are more or less the same band performs as the other what separates the two is largely a case of semantics as both utilize Can and Neu!like repetition even as theyre going stoner rock or jazz or drawing from Judas Priest. Circle as Pharaoh Overlord is the lesser of the two.  largely samey albeit saving the best track for last and adding a more dub influence. Surprising tuba heavy. Pharaoh Overlord as Circle is definitely the better of the two albums. Still repetitive but with more variety and with the shifts in repetition being a bit less subtle. Circle  Madonna of Viggiano Pharaoh Overlord  Elin Rient KotiinFuture  HorizonsI was initially a bit iffy as a lot of recent cold wave acts are kind of samey even moreso when theyre passed off as Shoegaze too but Future seems to be an actual mashup of Shoegaze and Cold Wave and one that largely works. My only real complaint is that maybe its a bit on the long side but its otherwise rather enjoyable. Horizons Try It Side EffectsDemdike Stare  ElementalsA collection of EPs  new tracks and alternate version. Mostly excising some of the more hauntological aspects of their earlier releases the duo strips down the music to its ambientdub base. The results are generally good but a consistent problem with their catalogue is the lack of continuity. Granted this is partially due the compilation anture of their material a third of the tracks appearing in the form of alternate mixes from their original EP release doesnt help either but even on an EP by EP basis it feels a bit haphazard. The results are good overall but theres a nagging feeling that it could be even better. Erosion of Mediocrity,LetsTalkMusic,crmhc99,6,t5_2t4it

And those are all rock musicians what about the other styles of music guitar plays a central role in  jazz soul RampB country folk world music even classical? All of those genres sound different and the sound and style of guitars used in all of them sound pretty different as well.

4196397,0,t1_cryedkm,Yes speaking of festivals some of the absolute best live music experiences Ive had were when I was fortunate enough to attend the New York All Tomorrows Parties fests. It was this amazing mix of bands and they held them at this old Jewish retreat in upstate New York as well as a couple other places one in NJ which took the fun factor down when they were no longer the communal sleepaway feel. The bands and fans all hung out together. Some bands had members that played a baseball game with fans played poker etc. It was a total dream come true for a lot of people. And for those first few festivals in upstate New York I felt for the first time and as some of the few times since like I was around music fans who were similar to me. There werent a bunch of drunk pushing and shoving and yelling people werent assholes in general it was really great. I think part of it was that you had to be a certain kind of fan to make it to upstate New York to see a certain kind of band. People came from all over the world. You had to be willing to sleep in a fallen down weird old retreat or in one of not super nice hotels an hour away for a few nights to experience something you really loved. So I think all that made those shows so wonderful.

4337271,0,t3_39vhx3,First off I think you have to understand the context in which Zappa wrote his music. Freak Out! was released in  a year when the number  single sounded like this Most peoples preconceived notions of what rock and roll sounded like would have been something like this If you were young and hip you were probably listening to Bob Dylans brand new album Blonde on Blonde which only came out a month before Freak Out!. When Freak Out! dropped the newest Beatles album was Rubber Soul. Revolver was a month away and Sgt. Peppers was a year away. Meanwhile somewhere in Greenwich Village a young unknown kid was toiling away in obscure cafes Most of the mainstream music youdve heard on the radio or seen at a record store was as you can see rather anodyne. It was the soundtrack of Mad Menstyle cocktail parties and Llewellyn Davisstyle coffeehouses.Into that milieu drops this As soon as you put the record onto your player it was completely different from anything youd heard before. This was loud. This was angry. This made a statement. Just look at the first linesgt Mr. America walk on by your schools that do not teachgtMr. America walk on by the minds that wont be reachedgtMr. America try to hide the emptiness thats you insideAs soon as that heavy guitar riff started you knew this album wasnt going to pull any punches. This album didnt care about prettyingup its anger in the sweet melodies and vocal harmonies of the protest songs of Dylan Joni Mitchell the Byrds Joan Baez et al.It was just so completely different. And it was so unapologetic about being different! Just imagine how mindblowing it wouldve been to hear that in contrast to soporific Sinatra ballads and the bubblegumfolk the Beatles and Dylan were pushing. Now thats just one album but I think you can apply it to Zappas whole career. He was always pushing the boundaries of musical expression. And one of the best parts was that he didnt take himself too seriously. Its extremely easy for avantgardeism to devolve into selfindulgent egostroking but Zappa never fell into that! He could write an avantthinkpiece as musically complex as anything Stockhausen ever did about not eating yellow snow! Of course none of this means you have to like Zappa. Youre free to like or not like whatever you want and even I occasionally get tired of his sense of humor. And a lot of his orchestralinstrumental stuff can be so strange and dissonant as to be nearunlistenable. But I just hope this gives you some insight into why Zappa is considered such a seminal figure in the history of American popular music.,LetsTalkMusic,csejgjd,2,t5_2t4it
4346486,0,t3_3ashfg,I feel like pop is one of the hardest genres to try to produce a critically adored song. Its really a tossup as to who gets respected and who doesnt. Why does Carly Rae Jepsens Call Me Maybe find its way onto many end of year lists for ? Its not particularly unique from so many other pop songs that came out that year. When it comes to it sometimes producers are capable of finding a beat hook or lyric rarer but it still happens. See A lot of Taylor Swift material that works its way into the ears of every listener and doesnt let go. In a lot of cases sure this results from the effort put into the track like Hey Ya! but sometimes even those just dont click. Its very often a tossup as to what I would consider a good pop song but the ones that really stand out to me are the ones that are honest. Theyre not trying to be something else they dont make me feel like theres a sinister purpose like the song is being cranked out for the sole purpose of making money. The key sign to this is if it sounds like another song. I kind of liked Jason Derulos Talk Dirty To Me when I first heard it just because the weird instrumentation on it felt interesting to me. Now that Ive seen it pop up again and again on Jason Derulo tracks Ive grown a strong distaste for the stuff. I think the worst offenders though the songs I find truly bad are ones that try to be something theyre not. Adding in a random EDM break in the middle of your track or a jangley am I saying that right? guitar really makes me feel like it was produced to try to create crossover appeal for the artist and kind of gives me a sense of disdain for them Dark Horse by Katy Perry made me groan when I first heard it. Rap breaks in the middle of a song really doesnt help either. I cant think of a single pop song Ive enjoyed that has a rap break in the middle. Let the song be what it is dont try to mesh genres be honest about what a pop song is and chances are Ill like it.,LetsTalkMusic,csfkxip,24,t5_2t4it

They were unlike anything I listened to at the time. I was super into emo and pop punk and then here comes this band that was super funky. I actually saw them a handful of times before SAJ even came out so all I had to go on were my shitty live recordings. I LOVED their live shows. I was on their message board back in the day when there were like... of us or something. They sent every one of us a signed poster and like an EP almost. I remember it had a Sunday Morning live version regular Sunday Morning and a couple more songs including a cover of Princes Darling Nikki. also the signed poster had them labeled as Maroon before they added the . Still have that baby in really good condition.  Anyways yeah I think the album came out a few days before the record release possibly cause I had listened to all the songs by then. I went to their Tower Records show and after we could get the album signed. They knew me by then because of how many shows I had seen and asked me how I liked the album and I remember telling them I didnt like it that much compared to their live shows because there was SO much more going on there. The studio songs just sounded flat to me. The more I listened I slowly came around to it. But yeah that was funny. I used to be kind of embarrassed at how cheesy the songs sounded on record compared to how much they rocked live and would try to bring friends to their shows to compare.

4563391,0,t3_3di1x7,Im in my mids creeping on   and the older I get the more that more musicians seem like real people or at least the more that I find myself seeing them that way.As little as  or  years ago Im sure I would have been absolutely dumbstruck if Id ever had the chance to talk to anyone like David Gilmour Robert Smith David Bowie or Pete Townshend.But as I delve deeper into their catalogs often liking their more recent material a lot more rather than what got them famous from the first halves of their careers  I feel feel being the operative word like Ive gotten to know a side of them thats closer to who and how they really are today or have been over the more recent decades.Now whether I could actually hold a decent conversation with anyone if given the actual chance is anybodys guess a coin flip at best.  If anything though I think Im starting to have an appreciation for how flippin hard it much be to be famous and to have everyone wanting a piece of them all the time in public.As a result Id like to think that I could approach them on a more real level  though dont necessarily think I couldwould  but Id like to think I could.It must be impossible to exist in this world if you had a hundred fucking fans all starryeyed at every turn  or even at best a world of people around you just staring all the damn time.Ive talked to probably  semiknown jazz musicians over the years and thats different of course  because its a much smaller world they exist and work in.

4571093,0,t1_ct6owwe,I dunno still seems like a lot of leaps in logic. White people will take over Trap? I mean as you said shes not exactly well respected. Even with Eminem getting popular almost  years ago I can only name maybe  or  white artists whove come at all close in popularity and Eminem was respected.Both your points read like the same generic complaints many genres have had for many years the idea that the wrong artist got popular that the truly innovative leading lights of the genre are almost never the ones to make it big and its ultimately nothing that hundreds of genres havent gone through previously. Iggy turns trap into a joke? Dubstep fans having been bitching about Brostep for years. Iggy isnt authentic? Well geez this is possibly the biggest gripe of any genre for about the last  years or so. My takeaway is that Iggy is traps version of Mumford amp Sons an exercise in tropes. The race factor is interesting for sociological reasons in terms of maybe why shes much more popular than her peers though in my opinion the explanation doesnt go much deeper than Iggy being more overtly pop but in the end the gripe is nothing more than the wrong artist made it big.,LetsTalkMusic,ct6spio,11,t5_2t4it
4605157,0,t3_3e2pzd,Ive got some Logitech BT earbuds that I occasionally use and havent noticed any particular degradation in quality when compared to wired earbuds in the same price range... Earbuds are taking a major hit in audio quality in the first place on a frequency representation level and it seems like the lack of accurate frequency response may in some way cover up the data compression artifacts that BT transmission would presumably introduce.Likewise the only BT speakers Ive listened to are crappy little  inch long battery powered things with cheap and nasty drivers. I expect the same sort of deal is in play as described above.I guess its also down to how the codec performs right? How well it compresses and then decompresses the data whether artifacts are introduced and what particular data is lost... Maybe its working on the same psychoacoustic principle that miniDisc does in order to save storage space where it intelligently selects which frequencies to reproduce and inhibits the harmonics which are largely unnoticeable and would just use bandwidth in the BT transmission.Im theorizing BTW and havent read up on any of this.,LetsTalkMusic,ctb2dlb,5,t5_2t4it

Maybe most people thought TPAB shouldve been a  who knows.The two things I find the most sus about pk is the  rating for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and the recent Future review. Any writer should know that giving a perfect score for any album is a big deal so what did that record have that none other did for so many years? I agree its a great album but I have a feeling it was done for the readers and to gain a larger audience but thats just me.then theres the Future review. The writer for this review is Meaghan Garvey and if you look at her twitter page then you can see how much of a Future fan girl she is. She gave the record a BNM when she clearly has a huge bias towards this artist. So idk its all strange but we also need to realize its all subjective and opinion.

4753907,0,t3_3fz60x,Ive had some really great concerts and then a few bad ones. I dont like the idea of  concerts just because it seems unfair to younger people that would like to attend this has happened to me a bunch of times and Ive missed out on some artists I really would have liked to see. But after going to  concerts last winter where there were immature little snot head kids pushing and just generally being rude for no reason I see the point in the age rule.     Most concerts Ive attended have been good show in themselves except for two specifically. I saw cage the elephant at the behest of my girlfriend last winter and they blew chunks. Their sound engineer was shit and the lead singer was too loud the guitar only played on the high E string and it all just came out as a wall of noise. She was even disappointed with it and we walked out early. Thats not to mention the crowd that was constantly pushing us and rudely trying to take our spots which I was ok with because I was just ready to leave.   The other show the whole disappointment lied solely with the band. They were uninspired in their playing and it made the show just seen ingenuine. I stayed for the whole show but I left before the last song was over because I wanted to beat the rush out.  Every other show Ive been to had been great. I have a few shows coming up that Im really excited to go to Dawes My Morning Jacket and Dweezil Zappa. Its really just a gamble and I suggest looking the band up on here before buying tickets because some bands sucks life while others just have a bad night.   One of the best shows Ive seen was last summer with the Taj Mahal trio and John Hiatt. Taj especially was just a great entertainer and a wonderful guitarbanjoukulele player. He was friendly and played a kick ass show. John was great too though maybe not as great as when I had seen him the year before but I still plan to see him next time hes in town.,LetsTalkMusic,cttrx7v,1,t5_2t4it

Esthetically it has no structure or sound.I would say that there can be pop music that isnt popular. I think something like Ane Bruns Do You Remember is a very similar aesthetic to something like say Florence and the Machine. Or at the very least we understand these to be more closely related aesthetics than either is to say Opeth. Since we probably have no problem saying Flo is pop I have no problem saying this song is pop regardless of how popular the example actually is.

4983320,0,t3_3j5u62,I have to say this is a really interesting album.  A lot of sounds like Miley singing Flaming Lips songs and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that.  The songs are cool weird and if they bring even more attention to the Lips then its a positive.  Its so strange to see a pop star who was once such a bland teeny bopper explode so much into a sex drugs and rock and roll persona.  I think if Grimes went full pop this is what she might become.Now the downsides of the album are the Mikewillmadeit songs.  They are bland and lack much of the experimentation of the Lips songs.  Im sure they were added as possible singles but the album which is quite overlong would have been pretty great without them.

4984767,0,t3_3j5u62,It could do with being a little edited down. There isnt enough gold to justify the hour and a half or so it goes on for but fuck me when it gets good its awesome.     I first saw the video to Dooo it! and just found myself unable to look away. The lyrics are somehow both over simplistic and utterly dada sounds are both somehow minimalist and overblown. The crazy icingjellysprinklesmilk stuff is weirdly erotic and grotesque and childish and conceptual and I just fucking love how all over the place the songvideo is. Its captivating. Its pretty much a microcosm of the album too.    I guess this is just what happens when you give someone as young and eccentric as Miley free creative reign and a fuckload of money to do whatever the hell she wants with. Its... beautiful. I kind of get a vaporwavey vibe from the album sometimes not so much in how it sounds but just in the way it has a sort of maximalist throweverythingatthewall approach and how it seems to be unable to decide whether its highart lowart or both ironic sincere or both.     I find it hard to explain but there seems to have been especially over the past five years or so a kind of theme for lack of a better word growing in modern popart especially music where things can be both totally sincere and immersive but still completely detached and selfaware and I guess ironic or sarcastic. You can be impenetrable and bizarre and allow whatever nonsense to just exist as a metaphor for whatever it is whether intentional or not sincere or not or as the case may be both. I think Im totally failing to get this idea across but I see it everywhere and I think Miley again intentionally or not sincerely or not I dont know has really hit on it with this album. Its like if someone told you it was just the sound of a twentysomething getting stoned and playing around in the studio with a couple of middleaged deadheads Id believe you. If you told me Yoko Ono and Marina Abramovic had come to the studio with a fiftypage manifesto for Miley Id believe you. The best part is that the question of whether its smart or dumb or naive or complex is utterly irrelevant. Trying too hard to answer the question kills the power of it. Its both. and its neither. Its fucking quantum probability and eastern mysticism all packed into a bong and then ripped hard by someone who somehow has ended up with a budget and an audience of millions.       Just the very fact that this album exists and sounds like it does is awesome to me. If you had told me five years ago fuck it a year ago that this is what Miley Cyrus would look and sound like in a year Id laugh in your face.    Also on your final point OP  gtThere are two possible outcomes with this album        It will kill Mileys career      It will change current pop trends as we know it    There is a third option This marks the point of Mileys departure from bubblegum pop and the beginning of her journey into weirdo pansexual dadaist freakart.

5080131,0,t3_3kk6z6,If youre talking about Free Jazz as a genre I think its helpful to understand the cultural context in which it was developed. For this discussion I define Free Jazz as the style of improvisational jazz that was established by musicians in the s such as Ornette Coleman John Coltrane Albert Ayler Archie Shepp etc.Free Jazz came about near the end of the evolution of popular jazz. While there were newer jazz styles that came later fusion smooth jazz and other genre hybrids free jazz could be thought of as the logical conclusion of jazz as a singular genre. In fact after the development of free jazz jazz was eclipsed by rock and gradually stopped moving forward.After the Big Band era bop and its various substyles became popular and emphasized small group improvisation over written dance orchestra pieces. Jazz improvisation was originally based around chord changes but musicians like Miles Davis and John Coltrane pioneered improvisation based on modes i.e. modal jazz which opened up new avenues for improvisation. The free jazz musicians expanded the vocabulary of jazz improvisation by abandoning or modifying the rhythmic and harmonic structures of bop. Many were influenced by developments in avantgarde music at the time and added elements of African and world music to their compositions.Free jazz is associated with the social and political upheavals of the s namely the civil rights movement. Free jazz can also be considered a precursor to the more radical developments in rock music in the late s and beyond.Some free jazz recordings that may serve as an introduction to the style Ornette Coleman  The Shape of Jazz to Come Albert Ayler  Spiritual Unity Archie Shepp  On This Night Cecil Taylor  Unit Structures John Coltrane  Sun Ship Expression Pharoah Sanders  Karma Eric Dolphy  Out to Lunch,LetsTalkMusic,cuycjl4,8,t5_2t4it

5178215,0,t3_3lxn6s,I personally think that in the current state of the mainstream music industry it wouldnt be a stretch to say that Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters are some of the only real rock stars of this current era. And yes it is undeniable that they are extremely successful. They are the only rock band out there with the level of commercial and critical success at the same time.But for me I would feel uncomfortable saying that they have any notable effect on the history of rock other than that they are keeping rock music effectively alive in the mainstream.The reason I say this is because I dont feel that their music is particularly inventive or at all that influential on the face of the genre. Yes the songs are extremely catchy and actually do take a good amount of musicianship to create but I still feel as though they arent pushing the genre any direction.To me they are essentially the effect of an archetype bombast huge melody driving guitaroriented poprock. They are extended from an already well established realm in music. They arent creating any archetypes themselves and they arent causing any truly memorable ripples in the world of music that other bands are seeking to capitalize on.With that standard in mind I would put bands like Queens of the Stone Age Tame Impala The Arctic Monkeys and Mastodon as those who are really having any sort of feasibly large effect on rock and its extensive genres. All these bands are constantly reinventing themselves and creating new sounds that have never really been heard before in rock music. These bands are influencing an entire generation of musicians to follow suit with the numerous genres that they have crossed over in. The sort of make me pick up my guitar and change the world element of rock music is certainly met here.With this in mind I think that the way Dave and the Foos actually effect rock music history is not their music but rather their attitude and their social involvement with music. And this is primarily rooted in Dave as a frontman of the worlds biggest rock band. Dave is constantly giving speeches as such a popular figure on how he got out there and pursued his dreams. And Dave even after breaking his FUCKING LEG got back on stage and not only finished the show but finished the tour. And through this he found a great deal of time to get others on stage and share the dream that he has pursued with him. And this is inspiring people like myself who honestly arent that crazy about the Foos music to get out there and chase what I love. It makes me think if a guy as truly everyday as Dave can get out there and remind me that I love music as much as I do maybe I can do the same for others.This is just a ramble at this point but it what it comes down to is that Dave is just a truly awesome and inspiring individual.TLDR The Foo Fighters music isnt my cup of tea but Dave Grohl is my fucking hero.,LetsTalkMusic,cva5xsj,68,t5_2t4it

5483550,0,t3_3q3blg,I havent heard Backwards it is one of my unicorns.  Ive always loved Coil one of my favorite bands.  Its a tragedy that John and Peter have left us.  One of my top ten concerts ever was seeing Coil perform at Irving Plaza NYC in August of  an event I never thought Id experience.  Their later recordings seemed to be much more stream of consciousness than the previous works.  The music became more subtle ambient and beautiful as the lyrics became more urgent chaotic and threatening. As if subconsciously John knew his time was limited and he needed to create before it was over.  In the late s I was given a cassette copy of some demos and out takes from Loves Secret Domain from a guy who ran the Brainwashed.com site.  The collection was called Loves Secret Demise.  It was supposed to be bits that never made it to Stolen amp Contaminated and Backwards.  Its been about  years since I have even seen that tape I really dont remember much of it standing out.  Some of the best things that Coil did were at the end of their career.  The live recordings are brilliant!  Particularly the cover of Bang Bang My Baby Shot Me Down an allegory for John and Peters failing relationship.  An Unearthly Red is another song that particularly moves me.  Its much more industrial than anything theyd done since LSD or Horse Rotorvator and the most accurate depiction of a post  world gt And the President of America wakes up With something dripping from his hands Dripping an unearthly red And is it dripping or only tripping? Is he screaming or is he dreaming? Is he screaming or is he dreaming? Or is he tripping or is he ripping? Is he tripping or is he ripping? I dont know  no! Because God told him to do it I am glad you brought up this thread the only musicians whos deaths have affected me as much as John and Peter are Joe Strummer and Johnny Cash.

If an album I like has a new gleaming mastering job Ill check it out. For instance even though I have err multiple copies of This Mortal Coils Itll End In Tears the latest remaster is exquisite like listening to the album for the first time again. Whenever the supposedly forthcoming Purple Rain comes out the same Ill probably end up getting it. Reissue in a better format. Im in the minority but my preferred format is CD and if a previously vinyl or cassette only release comes out on CD and I have a cut up copy on vinyl Ill think hard about it. Japan frequently releases old albums on CD and Im frequently buying them. Worthwhile bonus tracks. Live or demo or mono versions dont interest me personally. The VU Loaded box set with  CDs of shit I already heard or own with a poorly recorded live show tacked on? Pass.

5691280,0,t3_3sqi7l,Personally I rarely listen to music because of one persons playing style though it does happen sometimes.  I think the reason weve heard most of these classic tracks is because everything gelled well enough that the song somehow got out to the world.  There are some amazing drummers that weve never heard because they never quite found the vehicle for doing this.  Sure there are guys who won fastest onehanded drum roll competitions etc. but they may never get any greater claim to fame than that. To look at it from another point of view imagine Neil Peart in The Beatles or Ringo Starr in Rush.  Well... they both sound pretty interesting but the change in group chemistry may very well have doomed both bands to obscurity.  Maybe...Still another way to think of it.  Most of the world knows who Phil Collins is but not many know he is or was a phenomenal amp technical drummer despite having heard him on a lot of songs.The guy who epitomizes that Futurama saying in my mind would be Charlie Watts.,LetsTalkMusic,cx2k4ej,1,t5_2t4it

5867301,0,t3_3uu9ze,I bought California and their selftitled together at the same time based solely on the st artwork. Or rather I convinced my parents to by them for me. I had no idea what it would sound like didnt know who Patton was and didnt care much for the little bit of Faith No More I had heard at that point. Those two albums changed my life. California especially turned me from a skatepunk kid who ditched class did drugs and listened to normal skatepunk music into a fiend for weird music. Since then Ive become a fringe artist and genre connoisseur. My friends at the time thought it was cool in a weird novelty type of way but it completely altered the type of music I wanted to hear. They went back to worshipping simple punk bands for wearing girl pants and eyeliner while this album singlehandedly matured my music interests in the six months it never left my cd player.I started to realize how smart youd have to be to make an album like this how much of a fucking genius the combination of Spruance and Patton really was how tight a band would have to be to pull off an album of this scope. I dove into the albums intricacies and influences and I started listening to smarter more challenging music. I left some of my friends behind in the process and Im sure theyre still listening to the same radio music today dicking around my hometown probably with a meth habit or some shit. But I put down the skateboard and picked up a pen then a guitar then a piano. I went back to class then to college and I never liked simple radio music again.,LetsTalkMusic,cxoqft3,5,t5_2t4it

This girl cant even pronounce the name of the artist right the tries way to hard with the cringey squad thing and Im all but certain she has no clue what shes singing about.  She doesnt know what a bando is or what he means when he says whipping it.  Heres one that isnt quite that bad the performer seems like he has more respect for the original song and I think he at least makes an attempt to capture some of the feel.  He declines to use the n word which shouldnt be worth noting but in the world of white people doing acoustic covers it still is.The issue with both of them is that it removes the context from controversial and personal art.  That context is in both the vocal performance and the instrumental backing.  They are emulating a culture they dont understand being ghetto and hitting the bando isnt cool its simply a reality.  These people can borrow these lyrics about trapping to be cool and go home and sleep comfortably in their house in a upper middle class neighborhood.  ,LetsTalkMusic,cz2gej8,3,t5_2t4it

6497344,0,t3_44lp6c,I think creativity ebbs and flows in a way incomparable to the concept of an athletic prime where certain ages are accompanied by pretty rigid end brackets for a competitive career. But I like the idea of work ethic affecting a career and the quality of its output in both. For artists I think the big difference is the challenge isnt just in honing skills or an understanding of the art but also and perhaps more importantly maintaining inspiration to create. I think what a lot of the lasting artists can do is absorb inspiration from sources beyond their own personal lives  basically through openmindedness and empathy. Also as another commenter said judging the prime of an artists career is much more difficult than that of an athlete. For instance for me Graceland is Paul Simons greatest work and maybe even did more to influence modern music than anything from the Simon amp Garfunkel years.,LetsTalkMusic,czrdgq9,1,t5_2t4it

6630130,0,t3_46g4jr,Alright Im not even sure where to begin but here I go.  First off Im not talking about Nine Inch Nails or Aphex Twins.  They are both awesome and hugely talented.  Also I dont value electronic music less than other genres.  I apologize for giving that vibe.  Honestly Im just not sure how to think about this topic.  I realize Im treading into murky waters but Ill just say a few things.Im not really sure exactly what genre inside electronic music constitutes the type of music that bugs me but let me explain.  When I speak with peers about music they like I seem to get a similar reaction with some people.  They like catchy music like Steve Aoki and Kyogo because these artists illicit an immediate visceral feeling. They can immediatly feel an emotion and past that they dont really dive into the music at all.  This is the type of attitude towards music that bugs me and it may be that I am pushing this feeling towards the music itself instead of isolating these emotions to the situations they arose in.Most of the popular music on the radio doesnt have the dimensions that you guys are talking about.  You dont hear the amazing artistic talent of these artists on the radio because people want to immediately feel something.   I think the biggest flaw in my argument is that electronic music in the sense that Im seeing in this thread is a different type of art than the conventional band structure.  I guess what I miss most when I watch electronic producers hype up a crowd and create very stimulating sounds is the relationship between musicians in a band structure.  Watching musicians like Umphreys Mcgee Snarky Puppy or Percy Hill play together is an experience that seems to transcend watching Wave Racer craft a song and play it back in real time.Im starting to see that the issue here may be my approach to this inner conflict.  Thank you for the insightful information and eloquent responses.Also I was on a flight so I couldnt edit the post.  Plus Im extremely new to Reddit and I did begin by plugging my brothers band as one commenter gleaned.  But this has turned into an interesting conversation although I did get clobbered.

But I remember when I first started djing almost  years ago sheesh I was into one kind of music. I bought a few records in that style. And I learned them inside and out. I think once I got out of that one track mind no pun intended... or maybe it got really hard to keep track of everything. Now in the span of one month Im buying and downloading early s psych rock Tomorrow Twink etc to modern LA punky shit Tijuana Jaguars to reissued italo disco to modern dutch dark wave de ambassade and more. But ask me what I was listening to  months ago and my go to answer for everything is I dont know. Probably The Magnetic Fields. So I mean dont beat yourself up too bad about it. I think theres a ying and yang to everything. You have access to the most amount music of all time but you will never have the time to go through it all.

I cant really speak to the question of what sort of musical traditions may have informed the album.  When I first picked it up I liked that nothing else I had heard sounded even slightly similar to it.  Nicos voice seems to divide opinion pretty sharply.  I like it as an instrument although I would not describe it as versatile or pretty or broadly ranged.  Some of my favorite moments on The Marble Index are when Nico wanders down to the lowest notes in her register and hangs onto her vibrato for dear life.  Ehehehehehehehhhhhhh...Some of the lyrics sound kind of goofy to me.  But combined with her deadserious delivery they work somehow.  It would have been a much harder listen if not for the contributions of John Cale.  As for his parts I think its cool that he pulled in instruments I cant identify by their sounds.  Or alternatively instruments we recognize but that werent appearing on many pop albums in .  I dont recall hearing a single drum throughout.The Marble Index is a sentimental favorite of mine but it is not the kind of music Id play for my friends in the car. At least once my iPod has shuffled to a Marble Index track and Ive skipped it immediately.

An ambient tune on for instance Brian Enos Songs for Airports is clearly written and structured differently than a typical rock song that has melody verses choruses a bridge rhythm meter etc. To a certain extent we have the music vocabulary to discuss normally written rock pop jazz classical soul songs. We might disagree that a particular bridge sucks or not but most people would agree that a bad bridge hurts not helps a song.In spots Lil Bs compositions seem fine to me.

Considering mainstream music  I listen to a lot of it as well but most of it comes from only a small selected artists who might not put out songs as good as the last but they are more consistent in terms of quality of songs than the underground artists . So heres  things i noticed from my music listening habits. Pop music very easily discoverable but is of ok quality . Some are great some are just OK but more or less all of them are listenable . Whereas underground music is hard to find but is of top notch quality . . The boring factor  You cant listen to one song for long . The thing is that most underground artists have very few Exceptionally great songs . The problem with them is that you get tired of listening to these few songs again and again . Sometimes they have a lot of good songs but are of the same kind . The problem here is that you get tired of them and want to find a new artist which takes more time and effort .

Do you think deathcore is actually the second step in the process and people actually listen to stuff like crabcore first and just do not want to admit it?I got into extreme metal through Opeth having already been a fan of classic rock and metal Black Sabbath Iron Maiden King Crimson Rush and the like so all this stuff is far from my experience although I can see the connection. Opeth mix extreme metal with classic rock so they bring classic rock fans into metal and crabcore mixes...extreme metal with synth pop so they bring synth pop fans in. The difference is that classic rockmetal works and synth popmetal does not though Cynic do something similar with the vocoder vocals.,LetsTalkMusic,d2csipy,2,t5_2t4it

And then this thread comes up on my feed.And now Im back to Prince.Anyways I dont want to go over too much of what people have already covered but I think SoTTs greatness is owed in large part to its diversity and uniqueness seriously name one other album that sounds anything like SoTT. Something else I like just from reading the comments is how everyone seems to have different songs that they list among their favorites.For me I would have to go with the title track It and U got the look with I could never take the place... coming in a close . It is musically just batshit crazy. The drums are crisp and poppy but the keysbells droning in the background give off a haunting feel. Then he overlays the Mortal Kombat strings no idea what to call this sound someone help to make it pop right into your face. And of course as per usual the whole thing is about sex.I could never take the place... progresses like something straight out of the s except sonically it is drenched in s synth and funk. The vocals are beautiful and thematically I think it compares a lot to what Prince did on Dirty Mind.

7453579,0,t3_4hbp8c,Death Grips NO LOVE DEEP WEB release was pretty interesting and controversial. Epic record company had signed Death Grips to make the album in  the same year as The Money Store. The band had planned promised their fans to release  albums that year so they quickly got to work and had a release ready by August. Mid month they played a  day promotional treasure hunt of sorts through the chan music board where users followed clues and codes to decrypt files and find goodies like The Money Store demos the instrumentals of the new album and a release date for the new album  October  . After a wait the band posted on twitter that the record label was unwilling to release the album until the next year some time and that fans should note midnight on the st of October. The next day much to Epics dismay the band posted The label will be hearing the album for the first time with you. and leaked NLDW on Tor sites garnering something like  million downloads in the very short amount of time. Epic wrote to the trio expressing their disappointment and these emails were posted by Death Grips to their Facebook page the label decided to end their relationship with Death Grips.As the band had unofficially released the album they were lacking artwork so the leak had an improvised cover a picture of drummer Zach Hills erect dick with NO LOVE DEEP WEB scrawled across. It was taken in the bathroom of the penthouse suite at the Chateau Marmont where the band had spent the last  months in as well as their payment for the album from Epic.Some interesting articles on the album and influences  ,LetsTalkMusic,d2pfar9,18,t5_2t4it

This has been openly discussed among band members and has happened in more ways than one. Following this out the Dead and their touringlive experience could in theory live on longer than any before it if it has not already. This is kind of a different take on making music memorable as an evolving concept as opposed to some original recordings done so well or so groundbreaking they are never forgotten. I mean this only as food for thought as opposed to countering any point already made here. Can an artist or group be given further longevity by a devout following covering remixing reunion touring and creating new experiences out of the sound or experience rides movies documentaries theme parks???... or is that all just a side effect of how revolutionary and successful the original music was in the first place. I just think the Dead in particular blur this distinction as like you say they were always far more about the experience than the recorded sound aside from nearly inventing a more mainstream form of the jam band. ,LetsTalkMusic,d3jh4ia,3,t5_2t4it

Their music is still good but by no means deserves the reputation it is given by Tool fans.Zealous fans will often point to the complexity within songs. To which I can only respond with Okay.... I believe the zealots are trying to apply meaning where there is none and they often speak about that band as though getting it puts them on some physically different plane. On that note I find it hard to discuss Tool without also discussing Tools hardcore fans. I dont know why these fans are so adamant on pushing this Tool is the best ever especially when Maynard has already said such Tool fans are ridiculous They often put Tool on a pedestal and this is the face of Tool I think a lot of people see. When I was first shown Tool many of my friends spoke of Tool using the same rhetoric that the zealots use traces of that are present even in this thread and its really off putting.Edit I think I should end this semirant saying I do in fact like Tool.

7985167,0,t3_4oke4z,Modern guitardriven rock without the addition of any adjectives to the label unfortunately appears to be a genre visibly drowning in its influences.  The bands embracing this label and only this label cannot seem to shake the ghosts of certain heavily bluesinfluenced legendary predecessors such as Hendrix and Led Zeppelin as you mentioned.  Good examples of this case in effect would be Rival Sons or Sheer Mag.Modern hair metal would probably serve as a decent caricature of the situation with those keeping it afloat being solely hair metal worshippers and therefore being a genre that fails to attract any outside attention anymore.Instead subgenres of many types have flourished from the foundation that rock established adding new aspects that make it difficult to only describe them with the almost currently blanketterm of rock.  Punk sped up the pace and rapidity metal darkened the mix and added aggression alternative embraced the lighter side while welcoming outside influence from pop and dance etc.  Each of those genres even has developed and branched out intensely as well in the time that they broke from straight rock music.  Then there are even more subgenres that still hold the rock name but need to be specified further to properly describe them due to their quirks such as surf rock electro rock prog rock and psych rock.Also worth mentioning is that many of the artists that we consider legends of rock nowadays i.e. Queen Beach Boys do not seem to influence the modern pure rock groups surfacing despite these legends being still hugely appreciated.  tldr Standard guitardriven rock isnt dead but stagnant from lack of influence outside of some bluesrock greats.  Those rock artists finding outside influence seem to veer into many different subgenres.,LetsTalkMusic,d4dlwv2,7,t5_2t4it

With that said theres really REALLY lazy lyrics riddled throughout the work and none of it is anything truly new  or definitely not as borderpushing as many think. As stated elsewhere theres been industrial hiphop for years now. I do disagree with a lot of the hate the album received though. Its definitely not one of his most accessible works and features a slew of songs that are abrasive and hard to get into upon first listen. Ultimately though Yeezus is a good record with various interesting sonic ideas but falls short of a masterpiece with the lyricism and overall clunker here and there. With that said I enjoy the album and have enjoyed it since its initial release.

Thats fine and certain people are into that sort of talk but he definitely seems to have a set idea of what a good record sounds like and I think it colors his reviews as much as the actual musical content of an album.As a sidenote I typically dont like reviews that only tell me how a record sounds either.

9270413,0,t1_d8qmulk,Nick Cave is one of those great artists that will never stop making great albums until he dies a rare breed. However going off of OPs selection of albums Id say Nick Caves most significant work would probably be Tender Prey. Its the hit parade and their most recognizable work. Whats amazing about Nick Cave is that he hasnt become insignificant after the fact and he could very well put out his best work sometime in the future. Even after Boatmans Call Dig Lazarus Dig!!! is I think one of his top  albums and really redefined what he and The Bad Seeds are all about. As one reviewer put it this is how rock artists should age. And his  album Push the Sky Away is probably top  Nick Cave which really says something considering he has such an expansive and varied selection of just fantastic albums. On top of that it exposed him to a new generation and the album itself is very contemporary and a very new direction for Cave which he followed up on his most recent work. In an interview he mentioned once that his new fans didnt even care about his old material like The Mercy Seat and were only interested in his new stuff which he found refreshing. For an older artist to have appeal like that these days is pretty out of ordinary seeing as to how no one really goes to see an old rocker for their new album even though these old artists shove it down their audiences throats at concerts anyways.What Im trying to say is Nick Cave is definitely the kind of artist OP is looking for a man who keeps pushing and reinventing himself and not letting his best work stay behind him but always reaching for new ground a new definition. Good on you for mentioning him.,LetsTalkMusic,d8r3bav,11,t5_2t4it

9697921,0,t3_5dxt8c,Ive been compiling bestof lists since  which was essentially the year that I had begun to pay more attention to recent music releases. Theyre lists that I mostly share with close friends who have the same appetite for music that I do since it fuels discussion among us as we compare our own choices for the best of the year make predictions for the following years music etc. I still have all of my lists up to this point saved and it would be interesting to go back to them in  maybe  years time to see whether or not my lists still stand as they are. As for this year Ive been so behind on listening to new music over the last  months that Ive been playing catchup just so I can check off as many of the albums Ive been meaning to listen to as possible. Ive been making slow progress as of late since the semester is slowing down and the holidays are approaching also an American attending graduate school atm. Im hoping to listen to everything Ive been meaning to get to by the beginning of December.When I actually go about forming my lists I begin by writing down the albums in TextEdit that I intend to listen to throughout the year. Once I sit down to listen to an album I then add the genres that are displayed within the music along with Key Tracks that can either be songs that make the album as strong as it is or songs that I happen to really love. At the bottom of the list is a template for my yearend list where I plug in my Top  favorites up to three honorable mentions my favorite show that I attended and my favorite songs of that year. I may have four honorable mentions in my list this year though since two of them are EPs and given their length and transitional nature I generally dont include those or maxisingles as entires in the first two sections of the list. I always prepare these templates towards the end of each year along with a small set of albums that may have already been announced for the following year thus repeating the cycle. I consider working on my lists to be a yearlong process combining the actual listening experience with additions and revisions that are frequently made as time goes on. I dont complete my list until I am  certain that what I have is the order that I am satisfied with. ,LetsTalkMusic,da8h48b,1,t5_2t4it

9719429,0,t3_5dr6om,I agree with you that Saint Mesa is somewhat different than the others. On Rate Your Music I could see all of these being sorted as synthpop or electropop. I would tend towards the latter. Its sort of a broad category and it includes everything in this thread as well as like M.I.A. and Grimes so its not the most precise genre. But it works better than synthpop in my opinion which I tend to informally designate in my own collection as stuff that sounds like Kraftwerk where its on the boundary of rock and electronic and emphasizes synthesizers as opposed to this stuff where I think it takes more influence from danceoriented electronic music and RampB. Its all very muddled at this point I think mainly because RampB and rock were always separated more on racial lines than on real sound differences though they totally exist and existed. Now that we have sort of a homogenized reverbheavy genre with shimmering synths punchy drum loops and soft singing coming from a range of demographics people and labels are making less effort to distinguish what things might be coming from a more indie pop tradition thats adopted elements of dubstep and an RampB tradition that partially spawned it and is now reabsorbing it. ,LetsTalkMusic,dab4py2,1,t5_2t4it

So when they got together and formed bands they were naturally bringing in all kinds of nonrock influences and mixing them up together in ways nobody had before and that was a major part of what made the music so interesting and exciting.

I personally cant help but grin when listening to their music. The humor in the earlier stuff relied heavily on the use of samples from old bmovie horror films. Once the samples got too expensive and their budget shrunk they had to shift away from the earlier sampletastic approach. For over a decade they have been making sleazy discolounge music rather than industrial dance.The last thing I will say is that they had shitty music videos.

9977438,0,t1_db7gyho,We will have to agree to disagree on LoadReload I sometimes go back and try and listen with an open mind to see if the hate is warranted and did so recently after the release of Hardwired and whilst there are some pretty damn good songs on those two albums the majority of it is in my opinion fairly bland midtempo hard rock.I think the reason it gets so much hate is that simply during the s there were hundreds of bands doing the kind of hard rock Metallica was putting out and doing it way more creatively and with much more sincerity. It wasnt just that they had sold out or that hard metal fans hated it  I know plenty of metal fans who really like the Black Album and that is most certainly a cash grab  but that what they were doing simply wasnt original. You had bands like off the top of my head Alice in Chains Danzig Failure who were doing this kind of thing Metallica were going for and doing it without having clich lyrics about motorcycles or whatever. There were also a lot of metal bands who were continuing to innovate so Metallica seemed fairly tired and ironically as LoadReload were an attempt to circumvent this irrelevant. Whilst this isnt really anything to do with the music strictly speaking I think that a lot of the hatred Metallica gets from metal fans is contextual. Really up until the release of Death Magnetic they seemed to have this uncanny knack for finding the most potent way to piss off their fans. If you think about them during the s they were fairly prolific putting out an album every two years or so and in between releasing EPs encouraging bootlegging of their shows and all of that. Then in the s they release Metallica and have an extremely long hiatus. I guess metal fans were really aching for something new from them so when they come out with this hard rock stuff that sounds like a watereddown version of the heavier grunge bands that had been popular already for several years and grunge was dying down anyway this coupled with their insanely pretentious music videos and fashion choices seemed like a deliberate dig at the fans. I think as well in touring for LoadReload they basically refused to play any songs from their first four albums. Then they wait something like five years from Reload to release St. Anger which is probably one of the worst albums in rock music history and you can see why fans who had been with them throughout the s would be pissed off. More importantly  fan loyalty was something they really cultivated throughout the s and for a lot of people it seemed like theyd repudiated that once theyd had a whiff of fame.  ,LetsTalkMusic,db836j6,1,t5_2t4it

Generally its broadly quite easy to get a consensus on what the best albums of all time are  whilst there may be some discrepancies between individual rankings theres mostly a relative consensus within musical circles. When it comes to individual songs on the other hand youre isolating them from their context meaning theyd be much harder to compare and rank against each other. On top of that the sheer quantity of songs would be make it incredibly difficult to even begin to start ranking.

I remember when I saw Babyshambles play in Leeds the bouncers had to drag him offstage as he kept wanting to give the fans one more song on his acoustic guitar. Top top bloke the press were absolute animals with him and should be ashamed.,LetsTalkMusic,ddsak4u,5,t5_2t4it

10854498,0,t1_ddzjdsq,Because more complicated  better amirite????If complexity were all it took to make music good The Mars Volta would never have fallen off. Bob Dylan isnt a legend because he had the most beautiful voice or played the craziest chord progressions he wrote simple music that grabbed the listeners in a way thats impossible to imitate. Just like countless songwriters tried and failed to replicate Dylans success by copying his style Soundcloud is flooded with hundreds of artists who replicate Kanye on a superficial level without being able to imbue it with the heart that keeps so many of us listening to his music over a decade later. Thats why hes a legend.,LetsTalkMusic,ddzkc5h,1,t5_2t4it
10892403,0,t3_5vms5c,Gorillaz  Gorillaz Daft Punk  Discovery Tool  Lateralus. The first two just sound exactly as they are. Gorillaz stuck out as a peculiar piece of production to begin with. Its punkish immediacy has helped it stay alive. The more organic sound of the band keeps it fairly fresh compared to nearly any generation of hip hop. The only thing outdated about was already the case at the time it mostly follows the style of retro hip hop even when it was new so its kind of immune to no longer being trendy. Discovery is possibly the single definitive masterpiece of funky French house music. Its production was hugely influential and is still imitated often despite its tenure in a fast changing genre. Like Gorillaz it struck out to do its own thing. Its sticks out now every bit as much as it did at the time. Lateralus is possibly the definitive album of a band renowned for not sounding like anyone else. Having only one album since Id say it maybe doesnt have exactly the same clarity as most metal but neither did  days. That slightly muddy tone is their sound so it doesnt really seem too out of place. They still experiment with noise and some odd samples but compared to Aenima this doesnt seem to have lost much if anything to time. Honorable mention Kid A ,LetsTalkMusic,de3h2uf,4,t5_2t4it
10920325,0,t3_5vdvzv,Someone should have done this a long time ago. Thank you. You have no idea how many times Ive seen GNR Van Halen Led Zeppelin called metal.

10990203,0,t1_dedobm3,I dont see why both arent valid responses. Its two sides of the same coin to use an English expression and neither precludes the other. There are some genres of music to which I would argue it is not only needless but inappropriate to ignore the emotional for the sake of the intellectual such as American protest folk of the s and s and depressivesuicidal black metal. The former genre is routed in political expression and dissatisfaction with the way American society and politics were progressing in that time period something thats difficult to quantify. The latter genre is about creating an atmosphere that it as harsh and bleak as humanly possible and a consistent measure of a DSBM song is whether or not it succeeds in sounding legitimately depressing or whether it just sounds cheesy. Hardcore punk is another genre whereby virtuosity and intellectual analysis may not work all that well because the genre  at least in the s and s  was about the raw force of feeling drive and activism that such bands produced. Some forms of techno music too Im far more interested in how a techno set makes me feel on the dance floor and my emotional response than anything else when I see techno shows.But then you have genres such as jazz music where the opposite is true. An understanding of modal progressions can stimulate one to interpret Miles Daviss Kind of Blue or John Coltranes Giant Steps as theses of jazz expression whereas not having this music theory knowledge will lose a substantial portion of the impact and importance that either of those albums hold. Brian Enos Ambient  Music for Airports is a peaceful and relaxing album but its made all the more interesting by the generative process behind it.Emotional and intellectual analyses are both valid in their own right and either work in tandem in creating interpretations and appreciations of music. An example that utilizes both really well is An Empty Bliss Beyond This World by The Caretaker which samples old vinyl records from the s and s to explore the mindset of elderly dementia patients. On the emotional side its a haunting yet evocative portrait of sounds from the times on the intellectual side its a curious portrayal of what one might experience as they lose their mind with each skip and pop in the vinyl sounding like a thought on which the mind of a dementia patient gets suck.,LetsTalkMusic,dedpdqt,1,t5_2t4it

11184001,0,t3_5z5wa5,You have to define pop before you begin to answer this question.  I think a good one is short  minute songs in a basic format that usually involves a verse and a chorus.  So not necessarily popular music because thats not really a genre.I think catchiness is the key quality of present in any good pop music.  I love a lot of bands that are pop but a lot of popular pop music doesnt have much creativity in my opinion.  Personally I think Pixies are pretty poppy and theyre one of my favorite bands.  Majority of their songs are quick versechorus structure with a riff in the beginning and a short solo and outro.  Its formulaic but its still innovate and full of character.  ,LetsTalkMusic,dezozc0,2,t5_2t4it
11245604,0,t1_df6hryk,Me and you are the same person. I was OBSESSED with TMV in my late teen years. So obsessed that Cedric and Omar showed up in my dreams multiple times despite the fact that Ive never been closer than maybe  feet from either of them. I studied Cedrics nonsensical lyrics and corrected people who air guitared to Omars songs right handed. Then I had a moment where I realized that I had gone too far and the band wasnt the end all be all of music. I pulled a complete  after that obsession and got super into gangster rap. OP just give other music a chance and think about what you like or dont like about everything. Knowing how to identify what you like and dislike will definitely make you a better listener. ,LetsTalkMusic,df6o7t3,2,t5_2t4it
11304745,0,t1_df1lez0,Melvins are fantastic although I found them through my adoration of doom metal specifically Boris who took their name from the Melvins song of the same name. Stoner Witch Lysol Bullhead and Houdini are all fantastic. ,LetsTalkMusic,dfddjk7,2,t5_2t4it
11332687,0,t1_dfda16q,As pop music goes Taylor Swift is good at it.  She may not be original or have deep lyrics but she accomplishes what Pop is supposed to do.  Ive only heard her music occasionally but its bouncy and pleasant and millions like her so she must be adequate at least.  There are certainly others I prefer.Much of what Ive read in this thread reeks of someone who has gone through critic recommendations rather than listening to the music extensively.  Some of the suggested albums are difficult listens for someone who has not delved deep into that genre.  So while they may be high water marks for an artist I dont think they are essential.As just one example I would recommend Mingus Ah Um or Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus as starting points for Mingus who can be difficult for many.  For a casual jazz listener Kind Of Blue while ubiquitous really is easier.  And I think Essential means a quality recording that everyone should have and enjoy if a guest asks for that kind of music.  Approachable but not mundane.  As far as what is Essential for an individual that cant be defined.,LetsTalkMusic,dfgjh2j,2,t5_2t4it
11373052,0,t1_dfk2pie,Id also put metal as my favorite genre.  Interestingly in the last couple years Ive been actively trying to expand my music tastes and I probably listen to more nonmetal stuff than metal these days but metal will always hold that special place in my heart.  I think what makes metal stand out for me is how prevalent pushing its boundaries are.  As of late Ive been listening to a lot of post rock for example.  However the majority of the critically acclaimed post rock albums I encounter feel derivative to me or otherwise just dont really click with me.  The ones that click get a huge amount of play time bands like Do Make Say Think and Tortoise for example but I still find myself struggling to find bands in the genre that play my style of post rock. With metal I find myself overwhelmed with jaw dropping albums to the point where I am constantly missing out on absolutely amazing albums just because I cant keep up.  ,LetsTalkMusic,dfl44xb,1,t5_2t4it

11690541,0,t3_66rvma,I listen to everything from folk to to electropop to pop Which is to say that my musical taste has more or less stayed the same. I discovered Simon amp Garfunkel Nick Drake and Don McLean around   your standard white guy with a guitar singersongwriters. These are still the genres I find myself drawn to. Im a huge Taylor Swift fan and a couple of years ago I fell in love with Elliott Smith.Elliotts later albums were probably what attracted me to synth pop they definitely helped me get into Lorde.RYM and this sub have certainly expanded my openness to hearing and appreciating different genres of music. I can gladly listen to a broader range of stuff than I used to  I mean the other day I listened to Music in Exile by Songhoy Blues and loved the experience. Not the most diverse perhaps but its funny that I could enjoy an album from a genre Im not into sung in a language I dont understand.But as far as regular rotation goes my taste hasnt changed much at all. I listen to maybe six artists on a regular basis  theyre my staples.,LetsTalkMusic,dgl52tf,3,t5_2t4it
