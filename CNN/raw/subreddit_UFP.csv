3327445,0,t1_cp7jn1h,Our plan for Starfleet Holodeck for the coming months is to identify what games the community would like to see SFHolo support. Now obviously there will be different levels of support we can offer ranging from a simple dedicated subforum to a full staffing which could consist of Event Staff Quartermasters Logistics Officers or maybe a new type of role that isnt needed in STO. For the time being I am concentrating my efforts on research of the communitys gaming desires and establishing support for Minecraft and Star Citizen. Im currently working on establishing event support in Minecraft and finding out if such staff would be relevant in Star Citizen. Im also tossing around the idead of a Hearthstone Tournament if people would be interested....,UFP,cp7k18j,3,t5_35c86
