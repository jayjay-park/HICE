2053305,0,t3_2ibs9x,Short answer they is fine.Long answer Yes technically everyone is singular so you would have to use he or she in place of they and the sentence would read Everyone looks a lot angrier than he or she is! But colloquially you would almost never see it written that way.In the past couple of centuries the pronoun they has become acceptable to use in both singular and plural situations. Everyone looks a lot angrier than they are! would be the most common way to write this in modern informal English. Good job! ,GrammarNazi,cl0tjom,2,t5_2qk4m
