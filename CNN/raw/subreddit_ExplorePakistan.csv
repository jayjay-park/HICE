3255653,0,t1_cozgdwa,Kinda the same here. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes a year ago. One of my kidneys is failing me so I really had to force myself to stop. One thing Im still hooked to is cigarettes which I hope I can quit soon. I started doing other things with my spare time like hiking or exploring nearby forts and ruins. This subreddit has also become a really good hobby I can indulge in and distract myself from going out every weekend to get shitfaced.,ExplorePakistan,cozgjif,2,t5_341hz
