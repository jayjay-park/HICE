2514912,0,t1_cmmrmjq,gt Because Christianity is intimately based on the Old Testament and it is what Jesus taughtJesus taught the importance of turning the other cheek of loving ones enemies and rejecting the sort of eyeforaneye justice contained in much of the Old Testament. The long list of social injunctions in the Old Testament are also replaced in the New Testament by the simpler requirements to love God above all and love ones neighbor as oneself. So there is a clear difference in moral philosophy between the texts.How does Christianity reconcile this divergence? According to Joseph Ratzinger Pope Benedict XVI the Old Testament reflects the teachings of God in some sense but its message can only be understood by those who read it with faith in Christ and through the teachings of the New Testament. So it is not true to suggest that the Old Testament is on equal terms with the New Testament in the Christian worldview.And while there are parts of the New Testament that do stress the continuities why should we take these statements at face value? Most are found in the Gospel of Matthew which historical evidence suggests was written for a community of Jewish converts and so which not surprisingly diverges from its source material Mark on exactly these grounds. And then there is the borderline antiSemitism in the Gospel of John which came much later and shows the clear hardening of Christian attitudes towards Jewish communities. And regardless of how all this affects ones view of Christianity and its various inconsistencies none of it suggests that the religion advocates a literal interpretation of Deuteronomy.gt  Greek philosophersBut which Greek philosopher? Plato believed in the platonic forms but he also believed in the Gods and connected the two intellectually arguing  unless I am mistaken  that the Gods were by definition good. And Platonic thought formed a backdrop for the development of Christian thinking as well.

As far as I can find that  of slave owners were black is a number pulled out of the air. If you have a source please let me know so I can look at it.

They owned about  slaves out of   million slaves identified by the census. Thats . of all slaves. km x . I honestly have no idea how accurate these numbers are and I have reason to be skeptical since Taylor The Internal Enemy points out that lightskinned blacks often the offspring of white masters and black slave women often inherited from the white estates if they were light skinned enough. . Affirmative action and these other methods have not been particularly successful but before you dismiss them you should do some extensive reading about why. Ill give you a hint start with histories of the United States after reconstruction and how forces like Jim Crow basically reduced blacks back into slavery. For more modern reading there are plenty of scholarly articles about the quite intentional legislated failure of these measures. There have never been reparations that even closely amount to the value of labor or the wrongdoings suffered by blacks. . Uttering that youre a proud white man will not get you labeled as racist. But it should. Cant a person just be a proud person? Why do they have to be white? What the hell does color matter anyway? But see its mainly just the racists who feel the need to affirm that they are proud and white.     You know why black people have affirmed that theyre proud and black? It isnt racism. Its because white people which I suspect includes you and I have attempted to diminish them for their blackness for around  years ever since European whites started the modern tradition of black slavery. A tradition that undeniably reached its cruelest and most exploitative stage in the southern United States. The end to slavery didnt end the diminishment of blackness it just changed its character. White people erected a statue of one of slaverys ardent supports Calhoun in a public square. Are you religious? If you heres an analogy imagine your religion has been oppressed for hundreds of years and youre finally given theoretical legal equality only to see a statue of one of your most dedicated opponents erected in front of a city hall or a court house.     Black people have been forced to assert their racial identity because otherwise racist white Americans would have destroyed their dignity and used it to enslave them again which is exactly what happened in the wake of reconstruction. In some ways it was worse because the black population never received significant land grants and those they did were largely rolled back by Congress. Thus landless blacks were forced to work at subsistence wages for white landowners who mostly got all their property back.     But I digress. Deconstructing the antebellum mythology isnt the point. The point is that people who feel the need to assert their whiteness in this way usually are asserting it at the expense of the nonwhite. Nonwhites who assert their identity are usually asserting it because otherwise whites and whiteness would crush them.  ,Freethought,csgyp6g,1,t5_2qhzx

Compare USAs homicide rate to that of China or other major countries and you have your answer guns are the problem.And compare the typical lethality of knives to guns.  I remember that several days after Newtown there was a knife attack on a school in Japan.  Newtown   dead I believe.  Japan attack   or  dead  or  wounded.Possession of guns by the good guys leads to them being used by bad people. We have at least  million guns in private hands in this country. Somewhere around  are stolen each year. Your gun is far more likely to gather dust be stolen be used in a crime be involved in an accident or be used for suicide than to be used to defend yourself. We should get rid of guns. ,Freethought,ctj6hip,0,t5_2qhzx

5319849,1,t3_3nvqeb,This would be cool if it wasnt for the stupid name. Atheism has nothing to do with bacon. I know its just meant as a funny gag name but perpetuating the idea that theres anything funny about a corpse does not seem like rational empathetic lovingkind humanism.       Why tell people to think for themselves amp perpetuate the same mindless ignorance of sociallyaccepted nay sociallypromulgated evil relative as it may be?    Of course freethought does not imply not eating meat either. Its ahem agnostic as to this issue. Hence the complaint against the name it is needlessly divisive amp needlessly promotes a harmful meme. It assumes oh everyone loves bacon! when in fact I would rather sit my ass in a pew for an hour a week than eat a plate of dead pig at least noone gets hurt if I went to church however bored Id get.         Itd be like naming it The United Church of Dead Babies just bc some people find dead baby jokes funny amp dead babies are verifiable their only justification for promoting bacon. Thatd actually make more sense bc of the whole abortion debate lol. ,Freethought,cvro8hd,-3,t5_2qhzx

Meanwhile bluecollar workers are now competing on a global scale and are having their wages lowered through competition.

Historically the younger Sanders base that OP reduces to stereotype doesnt vote which is why the GOP gets as much traction as they have the other reason being gerrymandering but thats another issue.  If he gets them out to vote for him theyll already be there for the Congressional seats as well.Maybe Clinton and the MSM are hoping everyone misses that point but not only does it gut the argument that He wont accomplish anything but it increases the chances that he will be able to get something done.,Freethought,czpmc6w,3,t5_2qhzx
