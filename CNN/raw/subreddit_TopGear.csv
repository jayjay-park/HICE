113366,1,t1_cerbr08,On principle I would agree but Ive known of many people who are in no way homophobes but use the term gay interchangeably with the word lame. I have two gay cousins amp once at a family party they were talking about this. Neither had a problem with gay being used in this way because they just accepted that the word has taken upon new meaning in modern culture. Fag or homo bothers them not because of the word itself but because of the hurtful or negative nature of it. When people today say dude quit being gay or thats gay theyre usually just using it in a manner where it really could just be replaced with the word lame or stupid. ,TopGear,cerc7w4,3,t5_2r9n6

1023463,0,t1_chkltmq,It doesnt matter what technology or materials exist. What matters is what has been applied. The dome shape of the beetle is a strong shape. Modern cars have a number of things in them that make them heavier.You have not provided a single piece of information that would suggest that modern cars would perform better under that specific stress load. However some cars would like saab when it was around and volvo and more and more cars as the trend is becoming to make a strong and stiff passenger compartment but crumple zones everywhere else.Back in the days of that old beetle cars were made stiff all around. That fact and the dome shape of the beetle make it strong for what we are seeing displayed here.Most other designs are less strong on the roof like that.Its kind of like why an egg is really strong when try to crush it top to bottom.So the shapes of modern cars may be more advanced and more clever but nobody is designing cars to do this. The roofs of cars are not being designed to be efficient at hauling.  The cleverness of shapes and materials is prioritized to other ends. Although like I said some brands are building stronger tops like that for roll situations. But by and large most other cars and Im willing to bet even most modern cars are not as strong as that model of beetle for that particular load application.Its that car in that video for a reason.,TopGear,chkmhca,0,t5_2r9n6

1278672,0,t1_cidfhuh,Yeah I agree.Theyve diverged and converged at various times. The firstgen New Beetle stayed on the PQ platform Mk. Golfderived all the way through  all it got was minor styling updates. The TT on the other hand moved to the PQ Mk. Golf in  which it has stayed on since. The secondgen Beetle less the New appellation moved to the Mk. Golfs platform. This platform though still designated PQ is heavily revised from the variant underpinning the current TT. Next year however the TT moves to the MQB platform which is rapidly making its way into all of the VAG transverseengine automobiles. Eventually though probably not for another halfdecade or more the Beetle will also move to the MQB reunifying these cousins.As an aside the TT and similarly the AQ are oddly closer to VWs in engineering heritage than to Audis. Every other car Audi makes has a longitudinal engine while the smaller ones share transverse engined platforms with VWs.,TopGear,cidgutx,1,t5_2r9n6

3202444,0,t1_cotwbxj,The segment was just plain dishonest and I found it cringey. People dont want a poorly made boring car  to link to Top Gear themselves   Fiesta st Focus nd and Corsa rd. Apart from the Fiat  perhaps all of those cars are made very well and are nice vehicles what they set out to achieve. The top two the Fiesta and Focus are made very nicely look fantastic and drive even better. All these vehicles look nice apart from maybe the Corsa which is just boring to meI dont like Peugeot that much but they make things like the  GTI and RCZ which arent boring ugly or horrible cars. Peugeots newer designs are quite distinctively different which pulls them away from the stereotypes we saw in the segment so maybe it isnt a problem at all. PSAs other half Citroen makes things like the DS and C Cactus which are both amazing just at rather different things. PSA still makes a lot of crap though I will admit.This kind of thing probably doesnt bother the downvoting majority. Rest of the episode was great excellent music cool visuals audience interaction it was just Top Gear and it was great.

3491743,0,t1_cpq8eo9,Heres the PDFInvestigation findings  Ken MacQuarrieOn  March  Jeremy Clarkson reported to BBC management that he had been involved in aphysical and verbal incident with Oisin Tymon the producer of Top Gear at the Simonstone HallHotel North Yorkshire whilst working on location. The incident had occurred on  March and Jeremy Clarkson was suspended on  March pending investigation.I was asked to undertake an investigation to establish the facts of what occurred. In conducting myinvestigation in line with the BBCs usual practice I interviewed a number of witnesses and othersconnected with the incident. Accounts were agreed based on my interviews with each participant.Having conducted these interviews and considered the evidence presented I conclude thefollowing on  March  Oisin Tymon was subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attackby Jeremy Clarkson. During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck resulting in swelling andbleeding to his lip. The verbal abuse was sustained over a longer period both at the time of thephysical attack and subsequently.Specific facts I have found as part of my investigation are as follows earlier on  March studio recording of Top Gear had taken place in Surrey and the presentershad travelled that same evening to the location shoot in North Yorkshire the incident occurred on a patio area of the Simonstone Hall Hotel where Oisin Tymon wasworking on location for Top Gear the physical attack lasted around  seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness it is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation the verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion  both during theattack and subsequently inside the hotel  and contained the strongest expletives and threats tosack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room and the shoutingwas audible in a hotel bedroom derogatory and abusive language relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gearteam continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel in the presence of others for asustained period of time it is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident and believed that hehad lost his job following the attack I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby AampE department forexamination over the subsequent days Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to OisinTymon by way of text email and in person and it is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of anunprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an importantcreative member of the Top Gear team who is wellvalued and respected. He has suffered significantpersonal distress as a result of this incident through no fault of his own.,TopGear,cpqa804,6,t5_2r9n6

3493516,0,t1_cpqh2sf,Its a good question for sure. For . of jobs in the world punching a coworker after berating them for awhile is going to end in termination. However in this situation its less about whats right but rather whats the best business move. BBC likely knows that removing Clarkson is the death of Top Gear so they probably didnt reach this decision lightly.If I had to guess if it never would have gotten out he would have kept his job. Realistically the incident was going to get out. It was just a matter of time. Something like that cant be hid for long. Not with the largest show in the world and with some of the most popular and prolific people on television. It getting out puts the BBC in a very tight spot. The show would now loom in the shadow of this incident and every single aspect of Top Gear would be more heavily scrutinized than it already was before. Every tiny slip up would generate nothing but negative press. If Clarkson was not fired it would have been a slow and painful death over a few seasons. Quality would inevitably start to drop as the producers would continue to subdue the jokes and gags that we all love to prevent the show from slightly offending anybody. This drop in quality would be gradual and noticeable and eventually we would be saying Top Gear just isnt the same anymore.Given that rather depressing speculation I say that this is probably the best way to end Top Gear. Controversial shocking and abrupt just like Clarkson would have probably wanted it yet at a point where Top Gear is still considered one of the best shows on television. The amount of fan support Clarkson has received and the amount of press this situation has gotten is a testament to this shows continued quality and I bet Clarkson Hammond May and the rest of the Top Gear staff are kind of proud of that.,TopGear,cpqhhy2,4,t5_2r9n6

It gets tiring to have to modify what you say and do to reflect a new very restricted social standard  even if you agree with it. Clarkson spoke to that mind frame I think and I am sure he knew he was doing so and acted it up a lot as well. So the BBC knew it had a spokesperson who was going to cause controversy and was popular because of that but then felt it had to can him for the same reason.

5263741,0,t1_cvke9hc,gtgt Adding displacement is an extremely reliable inexpensive way to add performance to a car. What exactly is wrong about adding displacement?gtBecause its none of that. You end up with a massive heavy lump of a V engine that eats through fuel even when youre just pottering around that gets lower MPG than a small  litre turbosupercharged engine producing the same maximum output.Not necessarily.  Theres no free power. And again in terms of expense and reliability forced induction can be rough on an engine due to among other things compression ratio.But its nice you didnt think Id notice you didnt address either of my points.  Adding displacement is reliable and inexpensive so for you to say yeah but gas mileage doesnt disprove what I said. Especially because forced induction engines generally require higher octane significantly more expensive fuel.gtAlso because of engine management and the fact the engine is less than half the weight you can have that little  litre engine do far higher MPG when the power isnt required. Far higher? I think youre significantly overstating it.  Id like to see some comparisons you think prove your point.Make sure to include torque numbers in your comparison since forced induction generally doesnt do much for lowend torque.The bottom line is youre cutting and pasting this argument from .

If you read the whole article or even just the last two paragraphs it comes away with a far different message then the one people are upset about. Yeah a lot of the language in the column and ideas come off as transphobic but it also shows the evolution of a belief. He may speak out in horror in the middle of the article about an  year old girl who was a boy until she was  but at the end of the article he makes a very powerful statement. The BBC reported that  in the UK have a gender issue and Clarksons thinks that even if it was just one person it would be a horrible thing.  The whole article is actually him voicing his support for all official documents to have more than just the gender choices of MaleFemale.  He just did it in his normal way of providing support to the opposite side for most the articleclipetc before arriving at his actual current opinion on the matter. Its a very good way to persuade people to change their beliefs. First you supply a steady stream of support for their way thinking and right at the end you switch it up with a strong emotional statement and point out that the side you disagree with is not really that bad.

Its not bad but its nowhere as good as top gear.The biggest problem are the hosts. They fall remarkably short of standards set by their British counterparts. I think that if they change the show to be  mins long instead of an hour and focus more on strictly car stuff rather than challenges it would be better. Since challanges in the original series have so much more to do with the hosts chemistry rather than just making a movie about car the US version does not hold a candle to it.

I understand that you I and a lot of hardcore fans loved the show not just for the cars but for the  blokes presenting it.  But I honestly think expecting it to instantly fail is a bit of a misguided idea.  I myself will give it a few episodes to grow on me.

They used a gimmick for their Viper vs. Vet piece which is fine but then they only tested the Viper around the track. The Rallycross situation is  for looks and takes the competition out of it. There is no way to realistically keep the course the same so that their lap times mean anything. The new style of interviewing wasnt very good despite that being Evans bread and butter.

They liked the idea that I was going to step in and rescue you.May said We quite liked the idea of that you would step in as well.Mr Cameron continued You did actually send me a genuinely worried text.Clarkson confirmed I did and appeared to suggest he had done so because he feared they would be unable to get back to the UK.Former Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman subsequently denied the number plate was a stunt while the BBC rejected a demand from Alicia Castro Argentinas ambassador to the UK for a public apology.Clarkson  is a friend of the Prime Minister through the social network known as the Chipping Norton Set and lives in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire.He added that work on the trios new Amazon Prime motoring show The Grand Tour which will make its debut on the streaming service in the autumn is going really well.When asked to comment on the revamped Top Gear now fronted by Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc he said We are just working on our programme.,TopGear,d4fkd44,7,t5_2r9n6

Yeah he def looks towards the audience for validation. The pauses are especially obvious. I  agree about Leblanc hopefully he will gain more controlfreedom over production as time goes on.

They just have to seem meaningful and fair. The reason the Jeep challenged failed is that Evans kept changing the rules or making them up as he went along.The old stunt pieces even though Clarkson was once an owner of the property he was still beholden to the producers. Like in the Vietnam Special where he basically says Im not doing this. Oh ok. I really am doing this.re The new show ... They have three seasons on Amazon. I doubt theyll make any more. Amazon sometimes buys properties for a temporary status boost. Getting in the news is a bump to their stock prices keep getting enough bumps and it doesnt matter if you have a long term success as long as the basic marketplace and shipping company is doing alright.If they want The Grand Tour to take a victory lap before they get down to the nitty gritty it might be alright.

This was an intentional provocation and they had a handful of people telling them to get out of town chucking small rocks at their cars.
