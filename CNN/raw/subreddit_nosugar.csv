5102285,0,t3_34vcj0,This really went downhill for me. The focus on candida was a wait what? moment as Ive never heard of it before in any other sugar related articles or videos. Then it moves onto trying to get you to buy pills instead of avoid the sugar. But there is an easier way you dont need to give up the sugar just buy these pills!. They seemed to talk about only the grossest or obscurest forms of probiotics in their bit on bulgaria you can get the stuff from a lot more reasonable sources! If you really need some you dont have to buy a pill or go to bulgaria there are plenty of sugar free yoghurts and other sources and that is IF you need them.So yeah for a video talking about industry supported propaganda this really set off alarm bells that this is health suppliment marketing.,nosugar,cv10jzs,1,t5_2tapg
