68378,0,t1_cel0pk0,It is pretty much everyone against Levine and KMW... But mostly because they are by far and away the biggest and most successful organization.  Lots of jealousy involved for the other organizations.  The book is good a little outdated as the techniques are constantly changing for the better with the new school of instructors.   Levine barely teaches anymore.  ,kravmaga,cem7q1h,-1,t5_2rpbv
259598,0,t3_1x20df,One of the first things beginners often need to learn is the ability to tap into aggression. Some call it gameface in training but in reality its a measurement of how good you are at becoming angry on command. Dont be afraid to let go when the instructors tell you to go all out or to fight like you mean it  most people have to cross several personal thresholds before theyre actually at the level they need to be mentally to be a good survivor.,kravmaga,cf7nzvi,6,t5_2rpbv
275284,0,t3_1x6oaa,Not a good mix IMHO. Krav is designed to be and im generalising here... a blitz. Direct hard and fast. Straight in and destructive. It is also intended to become reflexive for want of a better word so mixing other different stuff in COULD have the potential to hamper that at least until you have been doing krav long enough to get it ingrained.I guess if you wanted to have something up your sleeve when you have disabled an opponent so you can lock them up it might be ok but I would do Hapkido or Traditional Jiu Jitsu for that maybe. SOURCE  Im an Aussie Fed so when we DO have to go hands on we kinda train to go from defusing the threat to controlling the opponent so you need to have some locks in your bagotricks. I have a Blue belt in Hapkido and I use the locks a lot especially the wrist and shoulder stuff.Just my c anyway.,kravmaga,cf9angz,1,t5_2rpbv

3058880,0,t3_2v6uhr,Great question. Traditional martial arts particularly with young students focus on moral skills like responsibility discipline and respect. Most martial arts were invented by monks and have a religious or philosophic underpinning and express it through their form. Krav Maga doesnt even like being called a martial art because there is nothing artistic about it. It teaches you how to be more aggressive than the other guy and hurt him first and badly enough that he cant attack. Its origins are very angry Jews killing Nazis and formalized by very angry Israelis defending a country about a rockets throw wide. My instructor will only teach it to adults who they assume have already learned enough responsibility discipline and respect or a student who has completed a blackbelt in something else. If you want your kid to be bullyfree at school enroll him into more traditional art like TWD or Karate from an instructor you like when he turns six. That should be sufficient for schoolyard level altercations and he can learn Krav when he gets older and the bullies get more dangerous. ,kravmaga,cof1tcy,5,t5_2rpbv

3503932,0,t3_30drts,Im doing  days a week and have been for just about  year now.  How proficient you become depends on how much effort you put in and what sort of instructor you have.  Youre not going to be a kung fu master but you can make significant improvements.A lot of it will depend on what specific curriculum youre learning and what your instructors focus is. In my program we learn the most important things that have the highest chance of helping you survive first and then as time goes by we expand into more specific scenarios.  Its a self defense gym not a competitive gym so our main focus is counterambush and escape not maintaining dominant grappling position and clinch work.,kravmaga,cpro8ma,2,t5_2rpbv

4896774,0,t3_3hycz6,If you have time ask your instructor or a higher level student to walk you through the curriculum a day or two before the test. I asked one of the brown belt guys at our gym to help me when I was taking my first exam and we spent around an hour doing a walkthrough. Also do not stop. If you forget the technique or blank out just do something. Instructors want to see a reaction even if its not stepforstep the one that they taught you. ,kravmaga,cubrzo1,2,t5_2rpbv

5058546,0,t1_cuvm871,Just started muay thai this week at a Brazilianrun school which I like since Brazilian MT has a lot of Dutch kickboxing influences which meshes with how I like to strike.

5144711,0,t1_cv63o5a,Oh I agree arguably once you get into the layers of countering an opponents counter stance matchups etc thats far past what KM is intended for. I dont think thats a bad thing at all. KM at its essence is designed to quickly give untrained people the ability to defend themselves against other untrained people and escape. That means a smattering of technique but a lot of fitness and aggression. And thats fine. As a system and philosophy though as you progress as a KM practitioner we should be open to adding in new techniques and increasing the complexity and depth of our skills. Yes krav is not philosophically at least intended for fighting off skilled attackers who will try to slip your jabcross take you down or pass your guard. Does that you mean you cant or shouldnt train those skills? Hell no. Learn everything you can and always keep growing. Assume an opponent can do everything you can do and train to overwhelm that person. That way if you do happen to be fortunate enough to have to deal with someone who knows nothing you have all the more margin for error.If I meet someone who can do basic krav blockingdefense has a textbook  defense and  or  decent standup strikes and theyre happy with that and dont care about learning anything more I dont judge. Its not my cup of tea to be that limited but I dont think less of them. I personally want to learn as much as I can and be comfortable anywhere the fight goes.

Now I tell everyone whos interested in training anything besides krav that they should go to that gym.Your gym youre going to tell everyone you know never to go there because they tried to screw you over.

8530084,0,t3_4wkzr2,Most of these stories end this way. No actual physical exchange. Then everyone comes together and discusses what you did well and what you could have done better.  This and other martial arts subreddits are pretty good forums for these sort of discussions.In class it comes in tidbits. With only an hour to train people dont want to sit down and listen to lectures.  Its all there though.  You run the hell away you dont engage you dont agitate people you dont turn your back.  If you attend seminars youll get a little more of this usually early into the seminar. Almost every technique is also prefaced with likely scenarios.
