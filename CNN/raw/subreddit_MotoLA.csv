179069,0,t3_1w5dko,These guys are legit. I bought a  GSXR  that was falling apart. Mike and Dan spent hours repairing my bike so when I got it back it ran like a new bike. They spent a lot of time to adjust my clutch cable solder my wire harness for my integrated tail lights expoy my fairings and gave it a full diagnostic. The best part is that when I called they were able to get my bike in that same day. Much respect. Would recommend.,MotoLA,ceytx6q,1,t5_2sj1y

3898767,0,t3_3299e3,I have State Farm and was recently in a moto vs. auto accident. They arent cheap and I had pretty full coverage. They were really good about everything though I did find that my claim processed much faster when I started to call every couple days to keep them on track. My bike was totaled and they gave me a really fair price based on what that model was selling for locally at the time. They also paid me out for my helmet and various modifications I had made to the bike. They didnt pay for my other gear that was damaged though. ,MotoLA,cr0oz3k,1,t5_2sj1y
3962904,0,t1_cr7shbl,I can tell you that it was not a tough class. I was nervous bringing a Harley to the class a dyna thought I might have dropped it because the course was advanced... but when i showed up there was an electraglide there and me and  sport bikes. we all had a blast and it was easy. a bunch of emergency stops cornering and going around cones. the instructors will help you out one on one if you are struggling with any part of it. ,MotoLA,cr8068f,1,t5_2sj1y

6316168,0,t1_cz2x2xk,Partially confused by all this. I couldnt even buy my bike without first insuring it in CAIf you have a permit you can legally ride your bike just not on freeways. I took the course and  of the guys in my class rode to and from class on their permit. One guy had been riding  years on nothing but a permit. Stuck to side streets and never had an issue. Not recommending this just a comment. I recommend you make your DMV appointment pay for the class so you can skip the riders test and just crush it out that way. ,MotoLA,cz7ktta,1,t5_2sj1y

6535251,0,t1_czv4l4i,I recently picked up the sena c. For dashcamcover my ass purposes it does the job fine and has a low profile Id recommend looking into itadmittedly its not cheap. Also the pictures not that bad and if they could do a firmware update that allowed fps andor better stabilization software it could be pretty niceI dont know if this is possible but its whats lacking.N.B. if you do look into it youre going to read about difficulties setting it up.
