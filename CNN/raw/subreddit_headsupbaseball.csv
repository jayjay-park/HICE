7901995,0,t1_d446cpp,The difference is the batterrunner isnt forced to hang back near home plate in case the ball is dropped.  If he cant make it to first base by the time the ball comes down then its not really a pop fly.When there are runners on first and second and an infield popup is hit both the runners on base have to hold their bases.  Then if the fielder drops the ball he would have easy forceouts at rd and nd because the runners had no choice.,headsupbaseball,d449bwv,1,t5_37zh2

9231786,0,t3_56qaec,My take is that he saw the bobble and ran but so did everyone in the stands.  I think the majority of MLB players put in his position would run home as well.Very dramatic ending to a game however if this happened two months ago in the rd inning I dont think it would be submitted.  What are your thoughts people?  I usually go with the general feel of the discussion in comments but Im leaning towards taking this one down from the fridge.,headsupbaseball,d8m7304,1,t5_37zh2
