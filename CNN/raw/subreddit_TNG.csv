5009590,0,t1_cupu99b,Whats bizzare is that Wesley drunk or not would have still been held responsible for what he did on the ship except he didnt.  Drives me up the wall.  Data just boinked Tasha Picard got flirty with Crusher most just got doofy or slow but nooo Wesley had to take over the goddamned ship committing every fucking crime the Federation apparently is missing including impersonating a commanding officer theft of Starfleet property treason and malicious intent to harm.,TNG,cupufkj,8,t5_2r2r0
5055001,0,t3_3k4ael,I watched the show growing up and absolutely love it. Im  so right around your age. Keep with the show through to the end you wont regret it. Patrick Stewart is just fantastic. His love of shakespear is shared by Picard which is cool because he has a ton of experience in theatre.The show does this a bit where it will alude to something the actors like or do IRL. The other thing that comes to mind is how Troy and Warf have other time lines where theyre married. My unofficial opinion is that they banged for a while though it is no secret that they were at least very good friends.Whoopi Goldberg asked the show for a role and took home pay that was vastly less than she could have demanded. She did this because of how TOS helped racial descrimination she wanted to say thanks. Oh and she is one of the coolest best acted characters in the series.As you watch you will see many actors that you recognize from other things. I always have fun trying to figure out where I recognize them from without looking it up. There is an actor in the show from the beginning who is in Breaking Bad. Can you guess who? Luxwana Troy Diannas mother is played by Gene Roddemberrys daughter. She is also the voice of the ship. ,TNG,cuvbhyc,2,t5_2r2r0

8721842,0,t1_d6szj5j,Both The Office and Parks and Rec grew the beard in their second season.The office season  was trying too hard to mimic the British office. Once they broke from that it improved greatly. And ironically enough Parks and rec season  was trying too hard to mimic the US office.,TNG,d6vvda9,1,t5_2r2r0

9877122,0,t3_5gs0at,It was just that he was an android so they questioned his sentience and they felt that if he wasnt sentient then he was just as much their property as a toaster is. Thats what was trying to be proven or disproven if Data was sentient ,TNG,dav0fve,3,t5_2r2r0

10589727,0,t3_5rgi32,Marvellous. Episodes that dealt with morality issues were always some of my favourite. Every time I go a few months without watching an episode I see a clip like this and just reminds me of the sheer brilliance of it. Coincidentally I was just thinking of another favourite A Matter of Time and it was linked as one of the related videos ,TNG,dd88yxg,4,t5_2r2r0
