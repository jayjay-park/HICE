In terms of application you did great!But looking at this my suggestion would be that the foundation and blushcontour that you did are a little off for your skin tone. This is not surprising since you borrowed it from your cousin! I would say start with a slightly darker foundation. Then see how the blusheye shadow choices look with your new base decided. Make changes as you see fit. For eye shadows I think your skin could look great with lots of colors. Try brownish pinks and purples golds or just whatever! Maybe try different types or styles of eyeliner. What youve done here is applied really well but since you seem new it could be fun to experiment. ,Makeup,ckpvaw7,3,t5_2qrwc

2947475,0,t3_2tx800,You need something that very very closely matches your skin tone.Most people start with a foundation all over to see what that can do then adding concealer to the pimple to cover whats still visible. I havent used foundation in the last decade and prefer to use a very small amount of concealer or powder to cover as small an area as possible. Sometimes this means adding a little cover in the surrounding area and blendingdabbing working out so the difference between the makeup area and the bare skin isnt noticeable.I mentioned powder because thats what Im using currently. More of a use what you got thing then realized it worked well. Its a mineral powder makeup that I apply with a very small concealer brush. Its kind of like painting. Through practice you learn when to touch the flat side of the brush when to wiggle the bristles straight on to get more coverage. Having the skin prepped is also a biggie  if your skin is flaky youll need to apply moisturizer first so the flaky skin doesnt just eat up all the concealer. Or you can exfoliate but generally you want to be gentle with your skin and especially around pimples. Having the skin kind of dewy will also help the makeup stick to your face. You should try applying concealer to your skin when its dry vs. moisturized to see the difference itll help to learn how much to apply.And the last thing Ive learned over the years... dont cover too much! Itll look like a pimple with a ton of concealer plastered over it which it is and a slightly less heavy coating will look better overall. Look at yourself from a few feet away when applying not super up close.Some people really dig the green tints to mask the redness of the skin but Ive never been able to master that. ,Makeup,co354fn,2,t5_2qrwc

4717336,0,t3_3fb5ar,Okie dokes! Background  I have quite clear skin but its often dry. I also really like natural looking makeup.  This is my morning routine with some suggestions for you  . Clean my face using the Garner Micellar Water  and some Aveeno moisturiser  if I need it. . Botanics All Bright Radiance Balm  all over my face massaged in. My skins a bit dull  if yours is not or if its oily avoid this!. Maybelline Baby Skin Primer  smeared with clean fingers around my nose and chin  if you have trouble keeping makeup on maybe try this around your forehead nose and chin.. After a minute I do the LOreal True Match massaged in with fingers avoiding my eyebrows because I tend to get foundation caught in the hairs above my eyebrows. I might go in and do another layer on my cheeks next to my nose where I get red patches. I really try to massage it in to make it look natural. I would recommend that you try doing the same  remember clean hands and only where you need it. Foundation is just to even out skin tone.. I use the Rimmel Wake Me Up concealer  under my eyes lightly massaging it in. Ill also pop it on any red patches or onto any blemishes  for pimples Ill use a Qtip to pop some concealer directly onto the top of the pimple and then pat around it with a little eye brush to blend the edges. Lisa Eldridge has a great youtube tutorial for this. You might try it with your foundation and the fluffy brush for blending!. I pop some liquid blush usually the LOreal Paris Nude Magique BB Blush  onto my cheeks with fingers  are you sensing a trend?. I tend to do eyebrows next  I use the Rimmel Brow Pencil  to fill in sparse bits and give my brows some shape. Next I do some Natural Collections Solo Eyeshadow in Walnut  all over my eye and just under my brow. I use an ecotools brush for this. Looking at your palette I would recommend the nd light nude below your brow bone and as a base colour  you can apply it with your finger or with a flat brush. Next try the rd colour blended into your socket with that lovely big fluffy brush a little at a time and then maybe a wash over the whole mobile lid with number  shadow. You could do the liquid liner withor some of that black or dark brown shadow applied on top with a qtip or small flat brush dampened to make it a little more intense. . If Im feeling fancy Ill pop on some Benefit Sunbeam highlighter at the top of my cheekbones not sure of price it was a gift. Ill chuck on some Rimmel Stay Matte pressed powder in translucent  with a fluffy brush all over my face. . Then its mascara and I have no idea which one!  .

5187567,0,t3_3m23dd,I am also very pale. Do you know your skin tone? Warm or cool? Warm is more yellow  where cool is more pinky. If you have rosy cheeks or get red easily probably cool like me!. The most important part for cool tone skin is to stay away from bronzy bronzerscontour shades. They are often too orange and look dirty on us. Essentially  of the bronzer market will not work for us! Assuming you are cool toned. You ideally want taupe colors and many makeup gurus actually use matte taupe eyeshadows and blushes for contouring!I would definitely start with just a powder to contour if you were to just start with one product. Get a taupe eyeshadow or a nonorange contour powder or bronzer  make sure its a matte finish!! Start by just doing the hallows of your cheeks. Im assuming you have seen videos of this on YouTube. You want to create a line from your ear towards the corner of your mouth concentrating the most of the colour in the midpoint of the two and blending it out either way. Just go slow and carefully and watch the colour build and adjust it based on what looks good with your face shape! After you master this you can try adding a dusting to the top of your forehead then the sides of your forehead and below the jaw line. The powder method is a good way to start because it can be done very subtle. Over time you will grasp the concept of creating shadow to affect the shape of your face. Next I add a powder highlighter since you are so pale you want one thats essentially pure white and you want a slight shimmer for this. Start placing this on the tops of your cheekbones parallel to the bronzer line and connect the  with a blush! Then you can also try under the arch of your eyebrows the bridge of your nose and my favourite is a very concentrated amount slightly above the tip of my nose creating an upturned effect!Once you start playing with this you will see how absolutely crazy contouring and highlighting can be and you will start to grasp the potential. Then you can look into getting really into it with creams andor multiple foundation colors etc. Sorry if this is too much info all at once! Best of luck!,Makeup,cvbaip5,5,t5_2qrwc

5725150,0,t3_3th4it,highlight the inner corners and on the ball of your eyelid with a pearly champagne shade for a quick fix. This brings more light into the inner corners and adds dimension to the eye. Its like a contouring cheat. If youve got a little more time you can add a wing to your eyeliner. However this time dont flick the wing up as you would do in a classic style but a little more downward such that the wing is a straight horizontal line extending out from the end of your eye. The idea of this is that vision travels along lines. So instead of lifting as you would with the normal upward flick you are extending your eye with the straighter wing giving an illusion of longer bigger eyes. so this is normal winged liner and this is a vague idea of the straight wing I was referring to Hope that helped! ,Makeup,cx6rege,2,t5_2qrwc

6006713,0,t3_3xkvm5,I would do a matching brown over the lid and under the lower lash line to get the sunken look hes got going. Youll want a liquid eyeliner with a fine tip they have ones with a felt type tip that work well to get the thinness of the line there. I would recommend a touch of mascara if your eyelashes arent dark already a lot of times if youre applying eyeshadow the powder will fall onto your eyelids and it looks crazy but mascara helps.

Walmart has Real Techniques thats where I got mine and they have little sets that you can get to pick up the basics.The rest you can get from Coastal Scents and spend ish for a piece set that WILL HAVE all the basics. Watch their website though because you can get that set for half the price sometimes. As for blending take your time. I usually start with my crease and blend the crap out of it and then I blend some more.

6826762,0,t3_498u84,Completely agree with this. You dont NEED makeup or cute clothes or anything else to be confident in yourself and honestly if you use them to increase your confidence then your confidence is going to rely on your makeup etc. Love who you are as a person and dont wait for anyones permission to do so. Be humble knowing that you have flaws like every other human but just try your best every day to be a better kinder more positive influence on the world. Youll mess up and make mistakes but the sooner you make peace with your imperfections the sooner youll be at peace in the world and comfortable in your own skin. If youre having trouble feeling good about yourself I suggest writing a list starting it Im rad and heres why because you are rad and if you think youre not youre wrong. Do this every day until you no longer question how awesome you are.Until then I agree again just do what makes you feel most comfortable. If youre insecure about your skin take some time to learn about skincare and try a bunch of different foundations to find the best one. If its your hair get it done. If its your clothes change them. Do what makes you feel comfortable.Finally screw boys. Just eff them. I know from experience that it sucks to go through high school feeling undesirable but high school is such a small part of life and guys get better as they get older.in general.Ultimately the only person youre going to spend the rest of your life with is YOU.

7602639,0,t3_4jeeo8,A long lasting foundation is important but I think that a solid primer and finishing powder are also what can keep makeup on forever. I recommend Urban Decays face primer. It keeps your skin soft and makeup stays put. Too Faced Hangover Rx primer is also very hydrating and Ive been loving it lately. I use BareMinerals translucent powder to set my face makeup and love it. I live in Las Vegas and work outside at a pool and the primingsetting helps keep my makeup on all day!

Hardly noticeable in everyday life but when I try to make a wing one eye will always look more angular then the other. So I started creating the outline of my wing using the lines from my cupids bow and it worked a ton better for me. Basically figure out whats symmetrical on your face and use that for wings.Another tip is go over your liquid liner with black powder using a angled liner brush. This helps set the liner fill in any missed spots and is a great alternative if your eyes are sensitive to tightlining.,Makeup,d38qmw5,5,t5_2qrwc

For concealer I mainly use the NYX HD Photogenic concealer in Porcelain. If I feel I want more coverage though Ill use the MAKE UP FOR EVER Full Cover Concealer in Pink Porcelain .  For powder I use the Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder under my eyes and just the NYC Smooth Skin loose face powder for the rest of my face.  For bronzercontour I love the Too Faced Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer. Its a little orangy though so if you can find another kind with a colder tint to it it might be good to mix both.  For highlighter Ive only been using the one in my NYX Wanderlust GoTo Palette. Its really cheap and works well. If you end up buying the palette though be careful with the contour shade because it is a lot darker than it looks.  Edit Sorry a lot of the products I mentioned arent the cheapest.

Shopping depends on what youre looking for and where youll be.  If youre looking for highend brands places like Nordstrom and Saks carry their own mix of lines think Selfridges.  Barneys might have a few more highend niche brands.  SephoraUlta have a wide range but very rarely do they carry the full line if the brand is carried at department stores Lancome Lauder etc..  Its also possible that individual brand websites will be able to ship and carry exclusive colors. Places like BlueMercury and Space NK are limited to pretty much LA and NYC but theyre makeup specific and tend to have smaller brands.

As far as primer I would try the  Make Up Forever pore filling primer its the one in the medium gray tube. Either that or Benefit Porefessional. Also an important thing to remember when trying to minimize any large pores is to pat on your primer NOT rub it in. If you pat it into those larger pores it has a better chance of doing its job amp filling them.If youre looking for a cheaper drugstore option some staples I keep in my kit all the time are LOreal True Match foundation amp LOreal Magic Perfecting Base. The base is probably the best drugstore pore minimizing primer Ive tried yet no one ever talks about it. ,Makeup,d9vayz1,5,t5_2qrwc

10139569,0,t3_5l22oh,Coming from someone who has worked at MAC and Lancome. I can get away with making a face look good with different low cost cosmetic brand products...except for foundation. Ive used lots of low cost foundation for theaterstage makeup costumes but for a everyday look it was always harder for me to match someone close to great perfect match. All that depends on ur skin tone tho you might get lucky. Lipstick eyecolor blushes and even brushesif u regularly clean them you can get away with most any low cost brand. I got my gf cheap Nyx lip liners in awesome colors that I love for a gift recently!!!Last thing Imma say it...Expensive Mascara is bullshit. Anything over  is stupid. Bc most all formulas of Mascara are very similar and the real difference is in the Wand. My gf has gorgeous lashes and women always ask her what she uses and nobody wants to believe its   Maybelline.

10164402,0,t3_5lgluo,By the way if you want to cover dark circles I recommend using a corrector first before covering it with your concealer. You want something peach if youre fair skinned or more orange if youre darker toned.  For the theory behind this and demonstrations on multiple skin tones I recommend Jordan Libertys YouTube channel as he does this in almost every video. Heres a video where he explains the theoryRather than using a product marketed as a corrector I just use a concealer in a much darker color than my skin tone and you want a very small amount. For example I recently picked up shape tape in tan and intend to use that as my corrector whereas I normally use fair neutral to match my skin.Again you want to use a tiny amount of corrector and only where youre dark. Then cover it with your concealer.Good luck!,Makeup,dbw6w6x,1,t5_2qrwc
10229167,0,t3_5mgs6k,Classic raccoon eyes. Very common especially with oily skin. Get an eye makeup primer top and bottom if you are doing eyeliner on the lower rim then switch to waterproof eyeliner and mascara. If youre tight lining Ive found drugstore waterproof eyeliner sticks are fine.  I use LOreal infallible lacquer liner a gel applied with a brush for everyday upper lid liner. Stays in place very well. If youre applying eyeliner on the bottom lid make sure you do a setting powder on your under eye skin before you apply too. It will help limit the spread of any eyeliner by absorbing your face oils.,Makeup,dc3j7he,2,t5_2qrwc

So my suggestion is definitely try a change up to wat face wash and lotion combo you use on your face and try again with a foundation.  You could try out the Re set  it lasts about  months and has a  day return policy.  Or maybe change from liquid to a powder or the other way around depending on what youve been trying. Sometime changing the form of foundation used makes all the difference.,Makeup,ddvroq8,2,t5_2qrwc

Likewise different thicknesses shapes etc will be more or less flattering too! So try different things to find out what works for you I tried Stilas liner its okay but after going to Japan I started using Shiseido FITIT Integrate Liquid Eyeliner it can be bought online too. Same deal as the Stila liner others have mentioned but I find the formula better for me and it doesnt dry out. Easily lasts a good  months regular use! Oh and its cheaper!
