4942743,0,t3_3iljvc,These are only my own speculations but I think that Tomas deliberately left it out in the Streetlight version due to the songs fast and maybe even anxious energy. To me in this version theyre emphasizing a sense of urgency encouraging the listener to explore and discover the world despite the uncertainty that awaits.That being said I feel that the final verse is much more appropriate in the Toh Kay version because to me the lyrics feel very intimate and personal. Its as if the narrator i.e. Tomas is reassuring the protagonist i.e. you as the listener that in the end things will work out and everything is going to be okay.Maybe Tomas wanted to save that verse so that he could deliver it in a way that would allow for the listener to absorb the message with maximum effect. Or maybe he simply thought it was too sappy for a Streetlight song. PEither way I find it crazy awesome how ones perception of a song can be completely changed with the addition of one verse. Its these little things that get the audience talking and debating and it makes me respect his artistry even more.Also its cool to think of it as a secret hidden ending that you can only discover if you listen to the Toh Kay version. ,streetlightmanifesto,cuhklvu,18,t5_2s6mg

I broke down but that song is very important to me. Oh and THTT is my favorite. The Toh Kay version actually made the original album even better and boosted it to the top to me.

By that time kings island will be open of you like roller coasters. Bogarts is right off of UCs campus and there are tons of places to eat around there. Keystone is a local place that does specialty mac and cheese thats pretty good the Clifton Skyline Cincinnati chili place is  hours and very neat the venue.

I just started working out regularly again and Streetlight has been a huge motivation for me as its the only music I listen to when I workout. This is a huge time in my life and Id be over the moon to get to go. Also I love skanking and can dance like no ones business. So if you want an epic dance partner and huge Streetlight fan Id be over the moon to accompany you to the show. Id totally pay for the ticket too or pay you back in ALL THE MERCH. ,streetlightmanifesto,d2twt8g,1,t5_2s6mg

10864727,0,t3_5v9bfo,Again like a few others slightly. I got into Ska through LTJ and they will always have a special place in my heart. Even seeing them last October I got stupidly excited and it took me back to being  again. Being on the UK ska scene I got to see so many good bands and equally many bad ones. And that era of music is what will stick with me as the better part of my teenageearly s. But these days its super hard to find a new ska band to be excited about. With a few exceptions its very hard to find something original and musically interesting. I completely understand where youre coming from. ,streetlightmanifesto,de0mbez,2,t5_2s6mg
