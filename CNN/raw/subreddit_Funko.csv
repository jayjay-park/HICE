7706447,0,t3_4kupfx,Display how you want. Boxes to me are part of the product they are what you see first when you see them on the shelves and the easiest way to spot a pop. Money and thought goes into most of the packaging. I prefer boxing most of mine except for a notable few or damaged box ones.People will tell me Im wrong but shrugs thats their opinion.,Funko,d3i66ts,2,t5_2yyr9
