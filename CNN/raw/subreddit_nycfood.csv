2654378,0,t3_2qbij2,Listen I am not even an NYC resident but I follow this page because I am there often. There is a side panel of this subteddit that has previous threads and suggestions of places to eat made by your lovely reddit New Yorkers. Utilize that. If youre mobile youll have to get on a laptop. These redditors cannot be bothered with tourism questions that have already been answered for you... ,nycfood,cn522b5,1,t5_2ryf6
11662801,0,t1_dghkba7,Ive been to the Bagel Store twice. The novelty of the rainbow bagels has worn off. They even have them in supermarkets now. The last time I went they were out of multiple things I wanted after waiting on the long line not worth it.I agree with you about Joes though.,nycfood,dghzrve,1,t5_2ryf6
