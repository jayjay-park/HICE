1019458,0,t3_25q27c,It really seems like all we do is give money to the government. I live in a pretty socialistic country and we have to give about  of our salary to the state. On top of this almost every product you buy has a  tax on it. So even the money you do get to spend is partially taken by the state. Someone recently did the math and he calculated that the average person works up until the th of june of each year just for the state. Still we get a lot in return.,isometric,chk63yr,3,t5_2tmcp

1255918,0,t1_ciatyx4,Thats a shame. A collaborative project like this might have given me that final push I need to get into creating pixel art since it would be a small and manageable first task for me and if my finished product was terrible well it would be drowned in the noise of all the other submissions anyway. Oh well.,isometric,ciawmbp,2,t5_2tmcp

2376446,0,t1_cm5fdni,omg that would drive a person insane. but I guess jigsaw fans like that! I editioned one of my car crashed as a hardwood jigsaw a few years ago. I had  made of the same drawing and when I was putting them in nice wooden boxes pieces from three puzzles mixed together. That took a full day to separate them.

6322924,0,t1_cz8btwi,I typically draw these rooms to make them make spatial sense but It seemed that the next logical challenge was to make them sensibly NOT make sense. If that makes any sense. So I guess I succeeded but really what I was testing is my tolerance to make this really big. This one is a tiny x and Im currently making one  wide. It was kind of tortuous  especially watercoloring. I do it because Im very curious about the end result  not because its an enjoyable process. I like the constant problem solving process but it does hurt my brain cry cry cry. ,isometric,cz8cif5,2,t5_2tmcp

10257290,0,t1_dc6nq7l,No youre right. I definitely see what youre saying. OPs work is too high res in terms of voxel space. I almost didnt see the voxels on the first quick glance.Still cool though OP!,isometric,dc6pxku,1,t5_2tmcp
10343723,0,t1_dcginaz,The hills roll up in front of you as you climb so it rereveals itself to you higher up with the steps rolling across the hilled path. It felt like something from a Zelda game. Go if you ever find yourself in Somerset. And check out the town below  so much hippie stuff!,isometric,dcgipt4,1,t5_2tmcp
11016264,0,t3_5x98g9,Thats a very nice drawing that youve done here ! Thanks for sharing Theres only two tiny details that baffles me if I may    when you have two windows side by side the shutters cant be fully opened the maximum being as you drew them  perpendicular to the facade. I dont think such configuration exists in real life for it would be a real pita to use and I dont know why it would exist in DampD either   under each of those two blocks of  windows you drew what looks like a bench. The bench on the left of the picture is as high as the windows bottom the bench on the right of the picture is about half way there. Therefore it looks like only one of those two benches is usable the other one being either way too low or too high.,isometric,degnv7l,4,t5_2tmcp
