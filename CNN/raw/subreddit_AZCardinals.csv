Arians work with QBs speaks for itself particularly with QBs who can extend plays in the pocket like Johnny can. And Tom Moores football IQ both at the QB position and offensively in general is stupidly impressive.Aside from maybe New Orleans Denver or New England I dont see many teams that have a much better support network for a developing QB than ourselves.,AZCardinals,cgxr57q,0,t5_2s58i

2050520,0,t3_2iaewt,I really think its going to be a low scoring game ish. Not sure who comes out with the win but it will be close. They have had issues running on teams not nearly as good as we are at stopping the run. An amazing passing game is nice but not being able to run the ball makes it hard to finish games out. That alone should keep this one close.I think Calais has a hellova game this is his first time playing in his home state since he was in high school and he should thrive off of that.I think the two week break from Ellington will see him mostly healthy and he gets over  yards. To win the Cardinals need someone besides Calais to generate a pass rush for Cromartie to be healthy for Peterson to play like he is supposed to and Honey Badger to show flashes of his old self even if he isnt  back.For Denver to win they need to get an early lead not let the Cardinals run well and to hit Drew Stanton a lot.If it was in Arizona I would say its a coinflip game but in Denver they have a definite advantage. A win with Drew Stanton here would say a ton about Arizona as a team but even being competitive would be a good sign.Also Denver fans you are not making yourselves look good in here.

I think they both will have a pretty good chance against us but I think the ers will be a harder team to beat since it will be the last game of the season and they will give it their all especially if a playoff berth is on the line. If our players can fix their mistakes Cat then all of these games will definitely be winnable.,AZCardinals,cmocwkb,3,t5_2s58i

3141956,0,t1_conhsaa,Yeah I appreciate when everyone pitches in cuz it makes it more interesting and it gives us a more clear picture. I had a good thread on here recently with another user and he mentioned it might be a good idea to go after the Raiders FA guard Wisniewski.And I get your point about premium positions but I agree with the idea that RB isnt devalued there just havent been many good backs in the past years. Take Seattles WR corps for example. Theyre nearly almost all UDFAs and sure they get the job done but theres no replacing a star  receiver.You could apply that logic back in past drafts why would the Cardinals take Adrian Peterson when they can grab a premium position like left tackle! Thats an exaggeration of course but Im just trying to illustrate a point.Let me just pose you this its not unreasonable to say that Randy Gregory Shane Ray Vic Beasley and Bud Dupree are all gone before we pick if not more pass rushers. And its not that unreasonable to say right now that Todd Gurley falls to us because of his injury. Are you gonna take the fifth or sixth best pass rusher or a guy who was nearconsensus top  PLAYER in the draft preinjury?Andre Ellington is a good back hes great outside the tackles as a receiving back and even as a receiver in the slot. But hes shown he just cannot get it done between the tackles. He struggles getting the tough yards.

The interesting thing is the hubris in there is almost too much to bare.  I get team pride.  I get hoping for the best... but seriously as a sub its pretty delusional.  Losing to Cardinals was  shit ref calls Cards defense isnt as good as the Hawks D though.Panthers at the moment because the experts are always  steps behind.Arizona looked so bad nothing against the vikings. But damn they looked bad I wish we played them when we finally had out shit together.It went down to the last play of the game for the Cards to beat the Vikings at home.The hits just keep on coming.  Im not saying that you guys cant do well but jesus kids... have some humility for your situation.  Half your sub is talking about a pats seahawks rematch.

And I trust Justin bethel a whole lot more on JJones than Cobb.And it doesnt really matter who he guards hes not getting near the ball. Aaron barely looked cobbs way all game week .  Hes too smart to test PP when weve got guys like powers and bethel who can be beat.Id love to see PP get in on the action  but thats not the life of a shutdown corner unfortunately.,AZCardinals,cyv7czs,5,t5_2s58i

6296620,0,t3_41tj77,Im from Seattle and Ive been a Seahawks fan all my life but my three best friends are from Arizona and over the last two years weve been watching the games together.  Ive seen a LOT of Arizona and really started to fucking love this team I now consider myself a huge fan and they are my secondary.  Now that the Hawks are out Im pulling for them to go to the Super Bowl. Me and my AZ friends are all heading to Vegas this weekend and Im putting  for the Cards to rip apart the Panthers.Anyway I posted in this sub a few days about lending my support even though Im mainly a Hawks fan and saying how much I loved watching this team play how they are all amazing guys and Fitz is the opitomy of class.  I said that the game vs. Green Bay was one of the best games Ive ever seen in my life.  I said good luck in the Super Bowl because thats where youre headed.I was down voted into oblivion and the thread was filled with comments to GTFO.I went back to my friends the next time we hung out talked to them a bit about the reaction from Arizona fans basically asked Whats the deal? I thought of AZ as the good guys team. Whats with the hate?  They had no idea and they talked me into continuing with my bet this weekend I was considering taking it off because i didnt want to support a fanbase that could get that toxic. My friends reminded me that you ARE the team of good guys and that this was more of an issue with where I was posting and not the fanbase as a whole.Anyway I read this thing from Fitz this morning  Whether you all like it or not going forward you are going to be seen as the heroes that you are.  I understand that the AZ fanbase is small compared to other teams but this is not a time to be turning away well wishers as bandwagoners. The Cardinals have not been in AZ for that long and their fanbase WILL be growing.  As a Seahawks fan I know this VERY well as they went from  to  over the course of what felt like a single season.Anyway this is a really long winded way of saying that this is a GREAT post to see and I appreciate someone saying it.  Im pulling for you guys all the way to the Super Bowl.  I know that the growing pains of a team blowing up fast can be weird but outside of that one incident you have all handled yourselves with the class of Larry Fitzgerald.,AZCardinals,cz5crlv,21,t5_2s58i

9303369,0,t1_d8v8p1y,That missed PI flag is a victory like it or not. Its deadly momentum because they beat one of the best in the conference at this time. The Seahawks just put a slug in the NFC Souths head. Their only worries now are Dallas and Minnesota whom they likely wont play until the playoffs. The Pats the Packers and maybe the Rams really seem to be their only regular season threats. I think the Patriots are red hot and will beat them. I think the Packers will come up short. The Rams are always a toss up against Seattle. We beat the Bucs and the ers. And thats it. Im now worried about every single game on our schedule where as with the Seahawks Im only seeing  games where they might take a hit. Im so pissed off at fate because no team deserves the title more than Arizona this year. When Palmer takes a snap I feel like taking a xanax. Ive lost all confidence in him. The rest of our team is great. Our defense needs work but we have the talent. But we need a QB we can count on I really REALLY wish we had utilized Johnson and Johnson when we had them. Now we only have one Johnson like any mortal man. We once had twin Johnsons and mighty Johnsons they were.Im sorry I got carried away with that.

10809301,0,t3_5ujhxg,Small school shit competition. He made College look like Madden on Rookie Difficulty. Thus teams were hesitant if his talent was real. Then you watch his Senior Bowl made everyone look like fools too.Then his Combine he did very well at the combine. Just had better prospects from a more proven Division available.And then his running style. DJ shies away from Contact and that made teams curious why a big guy would do that. DJ would rather juke someone than power through. Teams didnt like that. He runs upright as well which he still does and teams didnt like that either from a big RB.As for looking slow he looks slow because of his upright running style and the big strides he takes. When he lowers himself he looks much faster.,AZCardinals,dduwirq,20,t5_2s58i

He has all the talent of Kizer and none of the confidence issues.If AZ was picking three picks higher and had a chance at one of the bluechip defensive players then Id support one of those guys but the reality is that at  theyre going to be picking from a group of about  players that are all rated about the same.

At the least you can put him through training camp as a body or maybe use those  preseason games to see if hes still got it.
