5607845,0,t3_3rfyhs, years ago my wife surprised me with a song shop song to use as the first dance song at our wedding.  years ago he called me while I was on the toilet. I answered thanked him and told him I had to flush. It was excellent. ,SayAnything,cws7hcr,1,t5_2rzvl

6624894,0,t1_d04k2bg,His singing style has definitely changed but the self titled is the most polished sounding record at least thats my opinion as an audio engineer. Its subjective to a certain degree but as far as clean pop production goes its easy to hear that that album is the most well engineeredmixed. Not that the others are bad per se theyre just not going for a pop sound. Although the new record has some pretty shrill high frequency content at times they did a poor job processing his vocal IMO his sibilance is pretty obtrusive. But I dont really care I can forgive say anything for pretty much anything. ,SayAnything,d04kkj7,2,t5_2rzvl
7741801,0,t3_4kv73e,When I was in highschool some random kid I had only talked to a few times gave me a say anything shirt just because he heard I liked them and said he felt bad wearing a shirt of a band he hadnt heard. About seven years later hes one of my best long term friends and we still stay in touch and hang out whenever possible. The cool thing is Ive yet to see the shirt he gave me anywhere else not at a show or online. It has an ear on the front with crossing qtips behind it making an effective skull and cross bones and is an off tan color. It has a lot of sentimental value to me but its also just a boss ass tshirt ,SayAnything,d3m6q73,2,t5_2rzvl

8031013,0,t1_d4i4jaw,Yeah sheep is great. To me so good through overbiter is the meat of the album. Had there been some exceptional tracks on top of that it it would be a formidable album. ,SayAnything,d4irfaj,1,t5_2rzvl
8480111,0,t1_d60eshx,it would make me depressed it it meant max was doing that constantly and being miserable but its more of an isolated incident so I think its just funny XD.,SayAnything,d61k2eo,1,t5_2rzvl
10162513,0,t3_5lhkbt,I love my song quite a bit but echo the other poster  dont expect it in any sort of time. We were promised by the end of October then by Thanksgiving then by Dec  then by Christmas. We got it Dec . There wasnt a lot of creativity  the words were almost wholly from the paragraph my fiance wrote. That said it is absolutely the most amazing thing I could imagine. Its pure Max and I adore it.As far as Im aware though he isnt doing paragraphs this year. You can give him a word or a sentence and hell riff off it using his own experience. Paragraphs are only there for full albums. I could be wrong but thats what I remember reading.,SayAnything,dbvz6wc,3,t5_2rzvl
11059159,0,t3_5xfs7q,Yea Im Bipolar and have gone probably even crazier than Max went. No other artist has captured my experiences and their depth the way Max has. So when I go back through my life I can hear it through the music and thats what makes this band so damn special. Theres a certain passion beneath everything.,SayAnything,deljd6f,3,t5_2rzvl
11737703,0,t3_67hwck,I dont remember where it was answered I think maybe twitter? But Max said that it would go back and forth so you dont really know which band is gonna headline at each show. That way you gotta show up for the whole thing.,SayAnything,dgqhygm,3,t5_2rzvl
11743979,0,t1_dgqomod,Wow. That really sucks. ,SayAnything,dgr7kbu,1,t5_2rzvl
