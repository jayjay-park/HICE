Pes has a learning curve so take time and learn the command list.  They play differently so expect some frustration.Edit if you want some info as to whati think of this years game check my comment history.

2614461,0,t3_2pt213,I only recently started playing in the last month after playing fifa since .I like PES because the game doesnt let you abuse sprint it has slower build up play goals are conceded more because the offense found a way behind the defense than how in fifa where center backs often part leaving attackers with an open goal passing seems more accurate using L or LB I play type  controller configuration and being able to pick which player I want to run to goal with the right stick is great players arent falling all over each other. In general the team feels more like a unit.I like Fifa because the dribbling is tighter and better though maybe too good the graphics and presentation is better has licenses I wish PES had as default finishing feels tighter as well though also maybe just easier and individual defense is tighter for me. However the team isnt as strong a unit and thats how you get center backs getting way out of position leading to goals. I often feel cursed by momentum or scripting when my players feel sluggish in random games and the other team moves and reacts quicker and often in unrealistic ways. Opponent CBs changing direction to make a tackle in a flash against for example a fully fit Raheem Sterling who timed a fake shot and should be quicker. I play on pc and sometimes I can see it happen like the frames will drop for a second or the replay will literally show the other player suddenly moving as if he was fast forwarded. Losing in fifa often feels cheap like youre playing against the game more than the opposing team. Also each player can sprint all game. And counter attacking seems more frequent. TLDR I think PES has better team play while FIFA has better individual control and presentation. However FIFA is marred by sloppy team ai leading to defensive problems and scripting.,WEPES,cmzujhj,3,t5_30dws

6751600,0,t1_d0hmphh,Fucking. Really.. wow dude. The game set me a FAIR  on  with the keeper. I broke the offside line with a through pass and Mertesacker was the only defender within distance of me. Were talking about one of the slowest players ingameI made it to the box and slowed down for a shot instead my player slows down to the point of walking and the game fucked my control of the ball so then Mertesacker miraculously catches up and shamelessly smashes into my player. I had no CONTROL on the collision system in this game. But it was PAINFULLY OBVIOUS that it was to cripple my player to deliberately stop him from scoring not a defender realistically defending the ball but the game deliberately sticking to Konamis system. Are you really blind to what happened? If not at least a fair shot on target a fucking penalty. But this is PES so Im stripped of enjoying the game and forced to have fixed results shoved down my throat.Its fucking PATHETIC how set up this game really is. You never really win or lose a game. Instead the game either gifts you unfair momentum shifting to a win or deliberately buffing up AI tackling and manipulating ball trajectory and user control to set you up to lose. There is  fake difficulty implemented to create the illusion that you are in control of the game but if the game wants you to lose you lose no matter what. The game is a fucking lie.The development team have got to be one of the laziest of all time. The PC community relies on userbased patches to bandage this smegma of a fucking game. Even more baffling the Konami fanboys trying to justify how broken the game really is. Ill try shooting this replay from another angle if it isnt obvious enough what was justified in the video.English is not my st language so I cant really get my point across. But I hope you get what I mean.,WEPES,d0ho893,-5,t5_30dws

6781262,0,t1_d0kr7k7,Sadly its down to how Konami have worked out the team level ... Rather than being based on the top  players ratings  its based on the whole squad .. Which allows people to game  exploit  the system by placing lower rated players on the bench  white balls  and thus stack more black balls into the starting  but still remain within team level  or  ..From my experience with a Level  gold ball team  of people I play white bench to one degree or another ..

8395213,1,t1_d5qvyln,gt  Of course players are meant to play like their real life counterparts otherwise you may as well be playing a game where every player is called John Smith and they are all identical.I disagree. As I stated above part of the fun is in pretending to be MessiIniestaetc.gt Im not really sure why you are complaining that different players feel different.Because thats not what Im complaining about. Im complaining that the game plays itself. Shoot at the goal with Ronaldo and it will probably go in. Why? Not because the person holding the controller created space and shot the ball accurately but because reallife Ronaldo is awesome. Consider thisAn attacker is running toward a defender and attempts to beat him on. The defender obviously tries to stop him. What determines who emerges successful from this confrontation? The particular fine touch of the two human beings sitting next to each other on the couch? No. It is determined by a stew of stats the attackers dribbling stat the defenders defending stat the momentum system etc. The game does not work by modeling the physics of a soccer ball as much of their promotional material claims but by manipulating successfailure ratios. Otherwise Neymar wouldnt provide you with any advantage in dribbling the onscreen character would only look like Neymar the rest would still be up to you. The game is built so you can turn your assistance settings up and just kind of mash the controller against your cheek and awesomeness will happen for you. Its a game of numbers not of handeye coordination. Thats what Im complaining about.That and that the game intervenes so much on your behalf. Frex why is Super Cancel even necessary? Why do I have to press  extra buttons for the game to go oh he wants me to listen to him now. Why isnt Super Cancel just ON all the time? Because then you couldnt have pass assistance. Then you would have to pass the ball just so and run the pass recipient just so in order to make them meet where you want them to. And if youre not doing that then whats the point in playing the game at all? Its playing itself. Why not just watch a prerecorded reallife match and save the batteries in your controller?Theres a lot I love about PES I wouldnt complain so much otherwise but these things make it feel like a First Person Shooter that runs jumps and shoots for you but you get to pick the gun. Sometimes. But it looks amazing.,WEPES,d5qy5pw,0,t5_30dws

8470637,0,t1_d5yyq4d,Ive noticed that the opposition AI waits for your fullbacks to take a step forward so that they can then overlap them. Every single time. Its literally the only or at least the most overused trick they got. So it becomes a game of chicken. Of you just holding back those fullbacks just keeping them back not taking a single step forward. Stepping back and back. Because if you do step forward at that exact moment they overlap them with a through ball and youll never catch them again. Then its a cross or dribble down the middle where your CBs just turn around gliding on their ankles looking aimlessly and hopelessly.I hope  has more tricks and really adapts to your play like they say instead of playing the same predictable bag of tricks.,WEPES,d60dbii,1,t5_30dws

Thats he whole if you cant do it then dont criticize argument. EA have had similar issues I remember I think it was in FIFA  players could take control of your team however after a week or so it was fixed.Thats the thing they dont ban people. A well known lag cheater last year was like top  in the world. Countless videos of him cheating online and his account was still live. Los Aremenios or something like that.FIFA  has zero problems with lag cheating lol. Nobody can void the game when they are losing if they quit or dashboard or whatever you get your win.Out of  games I played last night  were lag cheated. Id say that was riddled with.I mean they are not doing good in the UK which is one the biggest gaming markets in the world they are doing worst than last year.

Pick a league edit its competition structure to have the correct number of teams then swap all the teams in that league with the imported MLS teams.

10917813,0,t1_de6091a,Thats what I meant. Ideally I would love to be able to take a tiny rdth division team why not even a neighborhood team? Lets go crazy! to the top of the continental competitions. During the journey I would like to be able to increase the capacity of the stadium change the lookcolors of the stands and manipulate pricing add premium sitting for example etc... with the money earned. Another thing I added there was that ML needs a better way to develop young players. Usually they develop best when theyre given playing time and its hard to give playing time to a rated player with potential when youre fighting for the league title or promotion. We need offseason club tournaments to encourage users to look for and develop players with potential. Also instead of going after specific team or league licenses why dont they strike deals with equipment manufacturers? That way you can have access to jersey templatesboots from Nike Adidas Mizuno Puma Le Coq Sportif Lotto Diadora etc... that you can color in Edit Mode and apply to your teams. In the context of ML you could unlock betterrarer templates as your club earns more recognition. They could also create achievements that would allow your players to unlock rare or sample colorways of bootskeeper gloves. I see a lot more potential in going in that direction than in trying to outdo EA in terms of licenses. Konami doesnt have that kind of money. I would actually support the idea of skipping a year or two of full game releases in exchange for season rosterkitsbootsballs updates if they could implement those ideas. ,WEPES,de63fyk,2,t5_30dws

10955253,0,t1_de9xigd,Yeah I dont know how open Konami are about whether or not theyve implemented scripting or not but derby matches are definitive proof that there IS a system in place that can effect how the game is played in almost every aspect of the game and that the system can get automatically triggered based on a certain context In this case a big derby match. So whos to say this system isnt being used to a small extent in online play?  I never play online so I cant make any arguments for that thoughI just hope they havent poisoned the online play with this system for single player I think its acceptable but when it touches online play it removes the skill gap between players which is just absolute BS even if its only used a tiny little bit.,WEPES,de9yfvm,2,t5_30dws
10956551,0,t1_de9yfvm,gt I just hope they havent poisoned the online play with this systemoh boy...it is triggered when a team has better players than the other like black balls vs gold balls  star team rating vs  star rating or the player rating is considerably higher than the other like  rating vs  the unbalanced momentum and lots of goals in injury time are also present.Edit I still play MyClub regularly though. When I feel powerless going against the game I stop playing for the day and it seems to lessen the issues.,WEPES,dea39cl,1,t5_30dws
