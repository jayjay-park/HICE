Microsoft will allocate a local Azure TAM who tend to know their stuff. Patching PaaS patching is a breeze and IaaS needs a bit more thought but fine with the right process. You need to assign your update domains right. MonitoringAlerts SCOMinhouse and New Relic gets every base covered. Gotchas for me wererelying on vpn when I should have deployed Express Route for hybrid services. some parts if my soa were not completely attuned to public cloud infrastructure. Cache retry logic and partitioning service bus for eg. Azure is an incredible platform and if youre an MS shop you should seriously consider it.

5709014,0,t1_cx4qj8e,Good morning. Azure SQL Database is a PaaS offering whereas SQL Server in a VM is an IaaS offering. They have their own advantages and disadvantages most prominently SQL Server in a VM trades off ease of management for more control over your database while Azure SQL DB does the opposite. You can choose SQL Database for your app if you are building a brandnew cloudbased app and need a fully managed cloud service that manages your database for you and enables you to focus on your app. On the other hand if you are migrating an existing onpremises app to the cloud and merely want to get rid of maintaining your own hardware but still want to retain administrative control of your database as well as underlying OS and VM SQL in a VM is more suited to your needs.
