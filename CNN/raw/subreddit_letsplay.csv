17769,0,t1_cegbwbw,First off I think you could do with lowering the microphone volume as much as that should be the focus it tends to overpower anything happening at the same time as when youre talking.Youre commentary itself is very good though you talk about things even when youre doing rather boring things such as scaling around the building but you might want to try and work on some reactionary commentary as well engage with whats happening on the screen.Actually watching more of the video you seem to do that a fair bit later on but itd be quite good to be consistent with that ,letsplay,ceggfts,1,t5_2qss1

38533,0,t3_1uf0a8,The echo is almost definitely from your monitors. If you lean over to the back of them and talk youll hear it first hand i bet. Cupping the mic or surrounding it closely isnt a good idea itll amplify the lower end and youll have a very boomy sounding recording. Your best bet is to move the mic. Youll want to place it around  inches away from your mouth thisll give you the best ratio of background noise to your voice with out you being too close. Try and place it infront of you too so that you arent talking passed the mic but into it. I know it might sound silly but mic placement is one of the most important parts of recording anything and the same applies to commentaries.Depending on the software you use then theres a few ways to do it. You should be able to set most DAWs to record to two tracks each with different inputs however you cant with Audacity at least to my knowledge. Audacity lacks in a ton of features compared to other DAWs. If you use Dxtory though you can set multiple outputs to different tracks. If you have an external soundcard then this would be perfect you can have a track for the game audio leaving your onboard soundcard. A track for your mic from the input of your external and then you can set skypemumblevent to leave your external soundcard to your headphones and have a third track set up to record that.Actually thinking about it I have a strong feeling that mumble allows you to record your audio in itself so that might be a perfect work around if you used that. Thats something Ill have to look into though.EDIT There is a way to virtually emulate soundcards so even if you only have the one then its still possible to do this I believe the software is called VAC,letsplay,ceitgfh,2,t5_2qss1
38924,0,t3_1ujrq7,I find it really useful to have a separate audio source just in case of crashes. If you look at something like Feed The Beast for Minecraft that can crash fairly often. Even if it does youll still have your voice audio from Audacity.,letsplay,ceiv1yp,1,t5_2qss1

69577,0,t1_celzhyh,Okay so I just took pictures of my setup not the best pictures but they should give an idea. This is before I added foam or anything and primarily the audio acoustics you hear in these two episodes of Goldeneye.Image one This was primarily the set up notice I didnt plug it in lol. However I made this really fast and halfarsed again my apologies so the microphone is usually on the table right behind the stand. As you can see when sitting in the chairs if leaning forward its a good  feet away from your mouth. On average it was more like  feet.Image two So this is more of where Ive been trying it lately just much closer to us. Leaning forward its only about a foot away from our mouths and leaning back is usually like . feet. It does seem to help a little bit. Ill run more audio tests to be sure. Please dont mind the disaster Tangela that is my PS headset on the one chair there.Image  and Image  Heres just a greater idea of my entirely flat ceiling and just the scope of the room Im resorted to recording in. You can also see the window situation as well and the fact that there are doors everywhere. If you have any ideas for specific foam placement let me know. I still need to go out and buy it. Edit Photobucket is evil dont use it. I linked all of these pics to just the image and it still forces it back into Photobucket And I also have a small shaggy carpet that I tried but it seems like I need to get something bigger. Hopefully it wont clear my wallet. ,letsplay,cemcmfn,1,t5_2qss1

When Im recording I go start to finish and my backlog has completely dropped to a manageable amount of games. Stupid Steam sales adding all that stock.. I enjoy making videos for gaming or otherwise. I love recording. Period. Whether its my own channel or the collective channel of my friends and I I enjoy recording.. Ive gotten a message from someone thanking me for what I do. This person was abused a loner and just kind of kept to themselves. They came across my videos and felt the need to thank me for giving them a little bit of sunshine and claim that I am helping them break out of their shell more and more each day. Its something you cant really describe.

Make sure we can hear you above your game volume  this was a huge issue for us in the beginning so dont stress!  Youll find your balance.

306594,0,t3_1xlc5p,What Ive generally found is that the first couple of videos in a new LP get a large number of hits but then the views start to taper off the longer it goes.  A lot of people use the first couple of videos to gauge your playstyle your commentary style or just whether or not the game looks fun enough for them to play themselves.  Just stay consistent with your LP make sure youre having fun and those who enjoy it will stick around.  And dont reference your numbers within the same week or month for that matter as a point of fact in how well youre doing.  Most of my videos have gained a lot of their views a couple of months after the LP was complete.  I figure this is either because   They wanted to watch them in succession like people who watch an entire season of a TV show instead of just episode to episode. They saw one of my current LPs and decided to check out the stuff Id already done.  Who knows though.  In the end just be consistent and have fun doing what youre doing.  ,letsplay,cfcjo5u,1,t5_2qss1

Your voice was awesome but in a game like this the game audio needs to take over a little more than your own. Your commentary was very funny but and I mean this in the nicest way possible try being yourself more and inventing your own sayings phrases like Snappy Snoo licking your lips all weird and making kissy noises is stuff PewDiePie is known for. I really did enjoy your content but remember to keep it more yourself.

You could improve your voice audio though. When the game in general is silent and by silent I mean not noisy it can help a lot to have nice and clear voice audio. Many people expect a review to be short and to the point. Showing of the pros and cons with much editing and such. I find it nice to see a video such as yours where you get to see the game as it is and not just at its best and worst but many might not agree.Thats pretty much the only pointers I had.

Ill see if I can work in my name and some links. Im not sure if thatd work with the current overlay so I may have to work on something new entirely. Its something Ill look into definitely.  I get what you mean with it getting dull. Ive always just found it annoying when people talk over cutscenes too much as it prevents me from understanding what the characters say. I guess this game might be an exception though. Ill experiment in the next episode to see if I can do commentary over the cutscene that doesnt detract too much from the scene itself.

617096,0,t3_217ou8,gt Is it bad to invest some money into a channel before you even know if people will likewatch it?Honestly it depends on your people in general financial situations. For some the cost is negligible for others perhaps most its not.Expectations are a big thing. Are you people in general expecting to make the money back that you spent on said equipment. The thing is it can be hard to know with any certainty the difference between views you are getting because you purchased new equipment and views you were going to get anyway.In general my advice is to wait on buying better equipment. What I mean is that if you are just starting out and have enough equipment to get started even if it is not the best just get started. The really important stuff you want to work out first is your process your preferences your voice not only literally but your presence etc and more. Additionally many people dont do it for long  they start and quit etc. Doing this for a while will give you a sense of that  getting equipment before you know you can actually stick to it is generally not a good idea for example.,letsplay,cgaey3y,2,t5_2qss1

Get an XLR condenser from BampH and youll be much better off.

AV is good as usual and the editing cutting between is pretty non noticable. Apart from the dubstep cuts which i particularly dont like in videos haha. I rather the cut without the silly sdubstep.So  mins is pretty long...Now test my interest holding  I actually lasted the entire video which is very rare for me. I ate my dinner while watching it.I really like your style its pretty unique and one of the best solo lps ive watched. You do a good thing sir keep it up.Only thing is i would have cut it at mins.

But I know other Youtubers pull things like Lets see if we can hit  likes guys and we will consider putting mod x in this pack. I hate that. Incidentally I only watch their videos to make notes of what NOT to do when I record.Oddly enough as a Youtuber I hate asking for likes.

855945,0,t3_23vqpy,Ah good ol Roxio...What I would suggest is getting a component videoaudio cable to run from the OUTPUT end of the capture device. If you cant use component you might be able to toy around with a composite cable running from the output end to your TV. It seems that the really weird looking cable youre using could be affecting the actual capture. Try unplugging the yellow cord from the TV and see if that helps on your capture window. What is that cable anyways? I dobt think Ive ever seen one with both component and composite before.Also I think your TV may possibly force your video quality down. Since you need to view your game on the TV to play you probably have your WiiU set to p? If you have a TV that accepts component in or HDMI in you can definitely get much better quality out of it. Also a few notes about the WiiU and the Roxio by the way from experience HDMI from the WiiU to the Roxio always seemed to cause problems for me. So I simply grabbed up one of those AllinOne component cables for WiiWiiUPSPSXboxwhatever.  Also I cant have the WiiU above p when recording. p shows fine on the TV but the capture is full of artifacts. I believe the Roxio has advertised  capture so I was slightly disappointed.  If you have your WiiU set to p before hitting Capture or Stream click on settings and MAKE SURE THE SETTINGS ARE SET TO p! I have recorded several WWHD videos in p on accident because Ive neglected to do this. This is usually only a problem if you switch to an older console like a WiiPS etc between your WiiU recordings  Did you know? The Roxio doesnt even have the same input and output cables run to it. I currently have component cables running in with an HDMI cord running out to my TV!,letsplay,ch1kqy9,1,t5_2qss1

898760,0,t3_24evi6,Something you can try Open DXTory and your task manager provided on youre on windows. Go to the processes tab sort by name right click on dxtory.exe and click Set Affinity. Remove the checkmarks at CPU cores  and  and hit OK.Java has a tendency for hogging up the main CPU core as it mostly runs singlethreaded this prevents DXtory from trying to use those same resources for live encoding. You might see an improvement for it.Other than that the only suggestions I have is to make sure that you launch Minecraft with bit java and dedicate enough memory for it. There are tons of guides on how to do this available with a quick google search.Edit An additional thought Are your game files on the same harddrive that you are recording to? Old fashioned HDDs can only really do one thing at a time so if you are both trying to write a lot of data AND read a big Minecraft world at the same time one or both of those tasks will fail miserably. ,letsplay,ch6fznf,2,t5_2qss1

I have a tiny desk Im trying to work with but Ill try and be more cognizant of it when I record in the future gt.ltAs for your video Ill add feedback here as I watch. Your audio is really low especially in the intro.  Had to turn my volume way up to hear you. At  your video changes aspect ratio for some reason then returns at  You were very informative with your commentary which is good. Also you added some humor in as well keep it up D Tags Your video doesnt have enough of them.  If you add more tags your video will hit more search results and be added closer to the top of the listings. Your thumbnails arent bad but they could be better as well.  They are uniform and informative which is very good. Think about adding your logo or something to them so that your fan base can distinguish your videos from the thumbnail alone.  When you search a game you can easily see which one is from Northernlion or Driftr or whomever just from the thumbnail. Again your channel art isnt too bad and is consistent. Better than most people with  videos D Nicely done!I think your biggest area of improvement right now would be audio Get those levels right and make it louder.  After that practice will be your best friend. You seem pretty natural when talking to your mic which is better than most people.  Overall muuuuuch better than most starting channels.

1105289,0,t3_26rfpz,Hey guys! Ive been gone for a number of months now however my channel is back... with a vengeance. I figured Id share some of the insights Ive gained during this hiatus. The three main things I have learned are brand development content streamlining and audience connection. In terms of brand development I have tried to set a hard upload schedule for myself and expand to Twitch. Setting an upload schedule allows for people to seek your channel out opposed to you the creator having to push it onto the users. Additionally without a schedule people tend to forget about your channel. In terms of Twitch this potentially allows for me to expand my brand to new users who would not have found me on YouTube. Additionally Twitch allows for easy content creation. This goes into my next topic.Streamlining content creation. When I was working on my channel from JuneOctober of  each video I put out would take at least  hours to edit. This quickly burned me out. This knowledge has allowed for me to develop new content that is easy to produce. I have recently started a live streaming show that keeps the values of out original videos but also negates the need for editing as I am doing edits and camera changes live on stream. By uploading slightly edited archives to YouTube this allows for me to easily produce lots of weekly content which will fill the drought between my highly edited YouTube videos. Additionally I find the live format is better for user retention. This relates to my third and final topic.Audience connection. In order to develop and keep an audience one of the most important things to develop is a connection with your audience. One of the main reasons I personally watch LPs and Twitch streams is because I feel like Im hanging out with buddies. One of the easiest ways to develop this connection is through live video. Being able to put a voice to a face adds a lot when it comes to this connection. As a user knowing the content creators at a more personal level makes them feel more responsible to come back each week as well as share your content. And I know some people prefer not to use facecam and I think that that is perfectly fine. Instead make a promo video or short comedic sketches similar to something like the occasional live Game Grumps videos. Something as simple as that lets your audience know you as YOU opposed to just simply a username.  I have only recently rebooted my channel with these values in mind so well see how everything turns out! However I hope I have inspired some of you guys or at the very least got you guys thinking about ways to grow and evolve your channels!ShootTheGames,letsplay,chtxfh9,1,t5_2qss1
1107431,0,t1_chu57k6,Exactly right. At the risk of sounding fairly cynical I think a lot of people miss that point. In the end the most you can do is nudge your style in one direction or another but the market is eventually going to choose you for your own tendencies and idiosyncrasies and no amount of refining and formulizing is going to change that. However you can always experiment at the boundaries of your comfort zone and adapt assuming youre the type.,letsplay,chu67sg,1,t5_2qss1

Im curious are you recording with a microphone stand or are you recording with a headset? I could tell its not a laptop mic because of how clear your voice was. Dont worry about talking louder your voice is very clear and pleasant to listen to!Bastion is a very narrative game but dont be afraid to turn up the volume for it just watch for when it gets loud. If you edit your audio and video separately you can always turn one or the other down or up.If youre not already using Audacity I suggest you use it its wonderful for recording your voice and you can remove the noises you dont like such as reduce static even though I heard almost none. I dont know how well it would work on your mouse clicks but try it and if you dont like it revert it!Ill subscribe to you and keep an eye out for your videos you just started and youve got a long hard road ahead of you. ,letsplay,chv2yap,1,t5_2qss1

By all means tell them what happened but move on. It would have made the intensity of that whole chase in the beginning a hell of a lot more real.

1274484,0,t3_28opui,Ive tried to handle my channel in a way that I shouldnt need to take a break or feel burned out.  I let my audience know that the weekly video count is a minimum of  episodes a week. This is a number I can hit without any stress and when I have extra timemotivation I release extra episodes.I also dont schedule my recording sessions. I just record when were up for it.  We have a large back log which keeps the pressure off of us for meeting any quotas or anything like that.  Basically I think for me whats important is that channel management always feels like a fun hobby to me.  If I was doing an episode a day indefinitely I know I would begin to feel like uploading videos is a chore or an obligation theres no doubt in my mind that Id need to take breaks.Ive heard that breaks can hurt your channel as some viewers have short attention spans and may just assume youre done.  If you do take a break be sure to keep your audience in the loop and let them know.,letsplay,ciczw7u,1,t5_2qss1

1325077,0,t1_ciiajps,I got to agree that I think it takes a bit too long for you to get to the start of your video. I understand that people like small montages like that but that doesnt mean the montage cant be in the middle inbetween a pause of voice or at the end or just a bit shorter. If you look at IGN videos they often start with some gameplay footage of lt seconds talk talk talk talk show some more gameplay talk talk talk talk etc. I think for starting out this would be the best way to go cause I enjoyed the review and thought you matched the tone of the music and game very well but if I was a normal viewer I might have clicked away. Also great job on matching the tone of your games.

1346182,0,t3_29hnfw,I really havent seen much negativity here. I believe comments like the saturation one are truthful but just may be stated in poor ways. With the barriers to entry in YouTube so low you have to have something that makes you pop. At this time that can still be your commentary and networking skills which are easy skills to master. I just started YouTube but Ive been fascinated by how it works since I started watching. It used to be Fred was most subscribed on YouTube then Smosh Then Nigahiga competed with them a few times. Now PewDiePie is far ahead with  million subscribers  years ago that would have seemed impossible. Gaming has taken over YouTube not in a bad way but instead of vlogs or stupid comedy sketches we have gaming videos  it shows with incoming deal with Twitch that gaming is a huge part of the YouTube culture now with that its important to be different. So I wouldnt say these comments are negative they are realistic. I believe this community is very good at staying positive. Just take a look at the comments of the recent thread about giving up on YouTube or the update Monday thread of people saying they got  views and others replying great job keep it up!. Even on the threads where people post their videos against the rules people have generally kept a cool head and simply link to the rule they are breaking. TLDR  This is one of the most positive subreddits I have ever seen. That is why Im comfortable being a part of it. I cant think of any negative comment Ive seen here.,letsplay,cil27xf,1,t5_2qss1

1382238,0,t3_29x8km,In my opinion it depends on what youre most comfortable with. For example I keep to  minute videos recording at p and .fps so basically . The reasons Rendering takes so long! I cant sit at my computer and wait for it to render I have to do something meanwhile and ANYTHING I do if I even touch it it will jump to  hours remaining. If not usually  hour. I had a very good day the other day and my computer rendered a  min video in  minutes. My setup is old. My screen resolution is x I cant actually record at p without it getting chopped off. My computer is very old and came with Vista. REALLY shitty GPU and only GB RAM. Its not powerful enough for me. Octodad Dadliest Catch runs at what fps without anything else up. Even Minecraft drops to fps when recording. Im using a webcam mic because I lost my wireless headset receiver which costs  to replace no I cant afford it. Im using headphones that are breaking. Ideally I need two monitors and the easiest way to accomplish everything is to just build a new computer and work up. Another reason of new setup explained next We have one computer between  people. Me who wants to game constantly because they cant on their netbook which Im currently on. My Dad addicted to a bad microtransaction filled Facebook game that requires him to be on a lot. My Mum who likes to pop on the computer at the most random of times mostly for Facebook. Its not powerful enough for me but its good enough for them. I need a new setup so I can be on the computer when I want. My upload speed is .mbs at best. My videos come out around mb. It takes  minutes to upload one so to upload  videos planned for maybe the course of a week would take  hours at least. I only get the computer for  hours straight every few weeks. Usually when I come off it because of a parent I dont wanna go back on it If I could even record at p at fps it would take so much longer. I watch most videos on my netbook therefore p is perfect. My netbook has the resolution of  x p so I watch videos in p and it looks fine for me. I dont have much to go off of apart from my own experiences with how I watch videos so I go off this.I apologise this is so long. Im really bad for that on this subreddit. In conclusion the best for me and lowest I want to go is recording at p for fps because its the most efficient for me. And I dont mind watching p. I prefer what people put into making videos and the content in them than the quality. I see youre also a NerdCubed fan hes successful at just p videos I think anyone can get on fine with p.TLDR Do what you want listed reasons why I cant record in p and people uploading in  is fine for me.

1451495,0,t1_ciy7ots,Thanks for the follow up!Its fine to disengage from the discussion at any point I know Im dragging out my question here but I think Im being dense. The thread you linked discusses a single educational video with the implication that future videos will have different content.My confusion lies with the fact that Ill have a great deal of videos on the same topic  namely the same game. The games I focus on are typically Roguelites which means they tend to be procedurally generated levels with permadeath. So a lot of runs are very similar in that they have the same overall gameplay and progression just with variances in level generation and loot and such.You could compare it to having a YouTube series that features a poker game every episode but every episode has the same players. Sounds kinda boring but the commentarys really why people watch  general banter and gameplay specific stuff kind of a mix between a podcast and a morning radio show.Does that clarify why Im struggling with the concept of varying my tags?,letsplay,ciy7xxd,1,t5_2qss1

How big the change is obviously depends on how well the work was done.

Keep the red G in there and I wont mind what else you do with it Ex. you can tweak the background color if you like.Channel Art The channel art was something I did randomly god only knows how long ago and Id love a redesign.

I dont know anything about Nvidia Shadowplay unfortunately.gtIm not super good with syncing up commentary audioI see this all of the time and have a simple solution. Start recording in Audacity and then start recording in your game. Now access a menu whether that is the pause menu or main menu. Scroll up and down the menu saying out loud which direction youre going with each button press. For example press up three times and down three times and say out loud Up up up down down down in sync with the button presses. When you go to sync them up later it is super easy to do.Bonus facecam edition Want to sync a facecam up too? After syncing the game and audio together hold fingers up and count on them in view of the webcam and say out loud the countdown. Now everything is synced!,letsplay,cj816n3,2,t5_2qss1

Aside from your OP the only info I can immediately gather about you and your sub are from your replies in this thread and those are colored pretty negatively.Which does matter cause it informs the attitude one might expect when engaging with your moderation over an issue you disagree on. If you dont handle conflict well here do I want to go chill on your sub and risk getting in an internet slapfight there too?Sadly I dont think any of my stuff counts as high effort so I cant give it a shot myself.

1578769,0,t3_2ccfkh,I would try doing something completely different. What ever youre doing is not working.So heres some pieces of advice Ask yourself why people would want to watch your channel. Figure out what you can offer them that would be of value. Read utheweem s comment and link. He spells it out there for you. Work on your keywords titles descriptions thumbnails. I just looked at your most recent Minecraft video and I think you need to tailor your keywords to be a bit more specific to your content and what people might be searching for.  Your titles dont tell us anything about the video. Your thumbnail shows that it is a SMP game and that is all. You need to tailor these things for every video. Heres a tip for picking out keywords. Take a look at your keywords and then do a search for each one. See what comes up. You arent checking for your own videos or anything what you are looking for is what kinds of results come up with those keywords. Are they similar to your content? If they arent then you need to use a different keyword on your video. If the results are similar then you need to figure out a way to make your video stand out.Example you use the keyword Open World Video Game Genre. Ask yourself this How many times have you gone looking for a humorous Minecraft video and typed in the words Open World? Lose it! Lose it now! And never look back. Keyword your videos by where you want them to be found.Figure out ways to make your content specific to things people are searching for. You say youre not advertising. and I say thats fine. Youre doing Minecraft BOI Skyrim these all have tons of different places on the web to get involved. You need to participate in communities related to these things. Not just advertise. Interact somehow. Often forums for these games will have YT Advertising sections fine use those. But also put your channel link in a standard font on your profile signature and then make comments that people will want to read.  The best thing you can do is to just make great comments on forums in the same style as your personality in your videos. And if people are interested in what you have to say they will want to see more of what you do. People can call that advertising I guess but its not direct advertising.Editing is not going to magically make people show up to watch your videos. It will just be more effort youre putting in. You need to think fundamentally about your channel and why people would want to watch it before spending another dime before learning how to edit and even before doing any kind of advertising. edit formatting,letsplay,cje6dn0,2,t5_2qss1

1706396,0,t3_2dwv1c,First before we can get into how it works lets establish some of the terms usedImpression  Whenever someone views an ad. YouTube uses the term monetized playblack in the place of impression. Important to note Not every video view is an impression.CPM  Cost per Mille. Cost per  impressions. Again its important to note here that  views does not equate to  impressions. TrueView PreRoll  This is the video ad you see before a video that has the skip button that you can click after  seconds. These ads carry the highest CPM however theyre also the hardest to get an impression on since skipping the ad early will not register it as an impression. These can have anywhere from a  CPM.Standard InStream  This is a video ad you see before a video that cannot be skipped. Youll typically see the CPMs for these range in the  CPM area.Display  These are banner ads. They carry the lowest CPM  CPMWhen you post a video depending on the length of the video you can enable and disable certain ad options You can turn on and off overlay invideo ads banners. You can turn on and off TrueView instream ads. Depending on the length you can setup midroll and postroll ads. These are ads that play during and after the video.Outside of that you cannot control is which type of ad YouTube will decide to fill the view with. A big part of programmatic ad buys is that it happens very fast and automatically.Now over the course of the month itll tally up your channels gross ad revenue. YouTube will keep  of that revenue and youll get the other .Important If youre part of a network that network will then take a cut of the remaining revenue. This is important to remember because while networks will sometimes offer a higher CPM than AdSense you need to keep in mind that youre getting a smaller cut than if you used AdSense. That additional CPM they offer needs to exceed the cut they ultimately take or else its not worth it. You also want to find out if the split you agree on is based on gross or net revenue. If you make  that month  of net after YouTubes cut means theyre taking an additional . dollars.  of gross means theyre taking . Small difference on that scale big difference down the line.Now by this point you may be wondering why the numbers Im throwing around seem way higher than everything youve heard so far with this  CPM stuff. Essentially as a very very generalized rule of thumb people skip all of the minutia of this and simply divide their monthly views by  and size that up to their net revenue after YouTubes cut which amounts to this very low CPM. This will work if you need a fast number off the top of your head in conversation but it varies far too much from month to month to use as any sort of precise measure. Ive had months where my CPM with that method is . and Ive had months where its over twice that. The takeaway is that the perk of programmatic ad serving is that we all get the chance to make some money for what we do. In a world of sold deals none of us would have ads running on our videos because YouTube would not have the manpower to make that happen with as many videos as the platform gets.The downside is that with so many variables so many different ad types and the speed as which it all works theres no way to make an accurate estimation of how much youll earn in any given month.,letsplay,cju94mv,3,t5_2qss1

Keep in mind at the time I had something like  subscribers. It was awesome. Then I got unhappy with everything. Not Youtube since my channel was growing faster than I had ever imagined but with life in general. I planned on taking a week or two off and I even  made a video to let my subscribers know. I didnt post again until the end of May. Almost  days without a video. Now as far as my Lets Plays go im lucky if they get  views even though I have  subscribers.

The editing is definitely interesting and pretty fun so far. Im still figuring out my overall process.For my first review which I had a lot more time to work on since it was me restarting I did a layout of general things I wanted to touch on and in what order and then wrote out a complete two page script. Side note Im aiming between  and  minutes for my videos so that plays into that. The bit of criticism I got for it was that I sounded like i was reading a script.The second one I did I just did the overall layout but it was a little bit difficult still for me to formulate the overview of mechanics how the game worked. I typed out the paragraphs and just kept trying different versions of it. The last one and my one for tomorrow are very much free form and off the cuff. Doing a lot of retakes and the like in the process. Im getting more used to it now so its easier but thats what Ive found works for me.Hopefully that wasnt too crazy of a tangent  lengthy.

If you are struggling to find it or if the people who have done lets plays have low view counts chances are you can pick up people using the fact the game is unknown because you are the only person making content for it.Stick to things that are current though. Most people will not go look up a game from years ago. When they see something new coming out they will be looking for it in the first few months. This is the time where you will get the most people looking for it.If you are trying to do anything that is AAA then you need to be very timely with posting content. Say Half Life  finally comes out. If you are not uploading content in the first few days you are going to have no chance to compete with all the big name youtubers that will be making videos about it. It never hurts to play a game you enjoy but if you are seeking viewership then you need to strive to be like those big name guys and be on the ball and timely with new gamespopular games.,letsplay,ckqc31u,1,t5_2qss1

The sharp clap noise that the clapperboard makes can be identified easily on the audio track and the shutting of the clapstick can be identified easily on the separate visual track. The two tracks can then be precisely synchronised by matching the sound and movement.

Do you think that hearing their idol being such dismissing about severity of this crime is good for their mental health being. Now all the other people who hasnt been rape can go to school and start making jokes like this to their colleges as result reducing chances of anyone actually reporting rape in fear of just being laugh at.

2104081,0,t1_cl796x4,Id like to add that this applies for basically anything whether its making quality videos marketing math or accounting or whatever.You shouldnt throw everything away just to focus on this one thing but any kind of venture is basically a fixed percentage return on investment. If you dont invest heavily your returns will be very low. The percentages dont change that much.If you want to save time you could invest some time in developing a pipeline system that lets you do what you need to do in a linear and iterable way to quickly get it done repeatedly but this is quite risky since its a horribly inflexible way of doing things and can actually cost you time if you end up having to change it very often.As in make templates for editing invest in software to automate some of the editing set up a RSS feed for new game releases so that you can quickly check any interesting ones  schedule your video releases invest in a rig for video processing so you can record and have editing going simultaneously get friends or acquaintances involved so you can record together for more entertaining commentary warning can be a liability in the longrun if they turn out unreliable etc.Doing that will give you more time for the stuff that cant as easily be automated like partaking in a community and trying to coordinate things. Either way youre going to have spend time on making it work for you regardless of which route you go.Its all a matter of where you allocate your resources and the more resources you invest the better returns youll get.Sorry theres no easy way out.And furthermore about the shy thing just force yourself to engage with people anyway. Itll go away eventually although itll be a painful process. Its a serious limitation and its very much worth it to work on it. I used to be very shy too.But yeah GL OP.

2207576,0,t3_2ke4de,For me I think its a combination of having a good computer with a solid internet connection and planning ahead.I only upload  minute videos but the upload to youtube only seems to take about double the length of the video so  minutes per upload.  If I spend a solid  hours uploading I can get between  and  videos up a day.  I wish I could tell you why my upload is so much faster than yours but Im honestly unsure.  It could be the format of video you upload or the speed of your internet.  Ive always rendered in MP and just get standard internet through my local cable company. If you dont already encode in MP Id recommend trying that and if that doesnt work then Id recommend doing some research try to find out how fast your current internet speed is and see if theres any other ISPs in your area that offer better service. In addition to having fast internet I also started recording and editing my videos long before I started uploading them.  I have a roughly  week buffer between when I record and when the episode comes out so instead of uploading every day I spend one day upload all my videos for the week and schedule them so that one video goes public each day.  I only present one video a day for now but If I had more time to record and another day off to upload I could easily schedule  videos each day using this method.Hope this helps!,letsplay,clkfqkd,2,t5_2qss1

2278284,0,t1_clsz0mr,To address your problem of slowdown you want to check your project settings to ensure that that the frame rate of your project matches up with the frame rate of your video. This is done under the render settings in the default workspaceThis should help with the slowdown but Ive read that Shadowplay doesnt record at a constant frame rate either which is another problem altogether. For that Id suggest reencoding the video using Handbrake but I cant confirm this will help. Make sure that your footage is not being cropped and specify the frame rate itself not Same as Source.Good luck with Blender I couldnt get the handle of the video editor in it.,letsplay,cltbc16,1,t5_2qss1

2650920,0,t1_cn4l0ej,Its... complicated. If you want to know why I started making videos its because I wasnt really having the greatest time in high school. I was close to failing a couple classes and I was really stressed trying to figure out what I was going to do after graduation. The only thing which actually made me happy was going home and watching Game Grumps or Cryaotic. They made a stressful part of my life bearable for me and I wanted to be able to do this for other people myself. I make videos because I want to make people happy and I love playing video games. I made videos and enjoyed making them slowly refining them and improving the quality.  months later though and I was no better off than when I started. Those amiibo videos were the first thing to give me hope that I may actually get to accomplish my goal... but now I just feel broken.,letsplay,cn4lu1n,1,t5_2qss1

2758142,0,t3_2rkvdw,For the best return on your investment building a PC is the way to go. Check out PcPartPicker which is a neat little site that allows you to build a PC component by component check compatibility and then track the cheapest prices of each part. Building a PC is not difficult at all its like playing electronic legos. There are lots of great guides online especially YouTube.To make a good rig for LPing you will want a decent CPU as much RAM as you realistically can get for video editing and rendering a decent GPU I would suggest going for a GTX  or better and at least  hard drives.  The first hard drive is for your OS and games and such while the second is what you record onto.Keep in ind for your budget that you will also need to purchase any peripherals keyboard mouse monitor headphones microphone and an OS as well.A note on factory built PCs. They are overpriced and underbuilt.  Usually they will boast something to reel you in like a decent CPU but the rest of the components will be subpar. They especially like to skimp on the power supply which will cost you a lot more in the long run in electricity and are prone to fail which will fry your other components. If you ABSOLUTELY MUST buy a built PC I suggest creating one with a site like iBuyPower. This will let you choose all of your components as if you were to build it yourself but they build it for you.  Not as cheap as doing it yourself but you will get better components.,letsplay,cnhl8v0,1,t5_2qss1

2830830,0,t3_2shwrc,Sorry cant help you with your camera. I do have some tips for audio though. As you mentioned mic positioning is extremely important. Here are my experiences For a condenser mic put a pop filter  from the mic and your mouth  away.  This should give you a good amount of bass while reducing background noise and lip sounds. Experiment with your mic though. My suggestion is to start a recording in audacity put your mouth  away and say this is recorded at  inches away. Then move to  away and do the same thing. Slowly move to about a foot away. Listen to the whole things and notice the change in quality over distance. Pick a distance that works well for your mic. Research the proximity effect for more info D Do the same this with inaxis vs. offaxis recording. Start on axis then move to  degrees off axis then  degrees. Notice the change in your audio as you move the mic at different angles. You mentioned echoy sounds when you are far away? That is because the mic has to work harder to pull sounds from further distances.  when you speak closer to the mic is doesnt have to pull the sound from as far and therefore doesnt get as much room noise.I use a Blue Spark SolidState XLR ardioid Condenser microphone hooked up through an Alesis Multimix  USB  channel Digital Audio mixing board.  I have it on a desk stand but am saving for a boom arm.  I use a pop filter and a shock mount.  I record onaxis at about  away.Hope this helps!SeaOtterGamer,letsplay,cnpuzmc,1,t5_2qss1

This can extend to a gaming handle as well if the main drive is the personality.But it is nice to be able to Title Drop ingame and have it be organic.The other consideration is a lot of the time a channel has been made by someone when theyre in their adolescence and the ability to rename the channel after a prepubescant mind told you PlatypusPwner was a great name is denied to you by redtape.In the end you can be extremely calculating and deliberate with your naming.

2962160,0,t1_co4sg4x,In a non aggressive way I have to say you dont know what youre talking about. Lots of youtubers make reviews of games and give short first impressions. That is a valuable source of game criticism that should be easily available to everyone. If someone who makes money off game criticism is forced to be in a contract with the company they are trying to review that is a conflict of interest. Not only is it a conflict of interest the review process holds the video up from  days. Essentially holding up the review past the point where is is useful for consumers to see. If you are able to still have the review out but without making money wonderful about  of your potential revenue has been lost. Youtubes copyright matching system doesnt care how much of a transformative work you make it just sees that you used footage. So you can either sign a contract with nintendo allowing you to do your JOB as a reviewer or allow your channel to either get a claim or a strike. You can contest this but it takes up to and usually a month. In that time the video you base your income off of makes no money. Or you get a strike and none of your videos game money. ,letsplay,co4t95x,7,t5_2qss1

Itd be good to see if you can find a mic position or filter a physical one like a pop filter that cuts down on those. Its not horrible to listen to just something I notice since Ive been trying to cut down on them in my own videos.I think your video was slightly delayed behind your audio you were saying things slightly before they happened on screen. Just a minor thing to look it.You have a tendency to just be reacting to whats on screen rather than leading the commentary yourself and there is silence in places.

Either way ours was to use xsplit and skype screensharing to share the screen with little delay at all. That doesnt involve audio and thats where it got complicated for us. We found a solution through using VAC virtual audio cables and audiorepeater. We then had game audio on VAC  my voice on VAC  and second persons voice on VAC . Put a repeater on VAC  to repeat the game audio to VAC  which was what I heard in my heeadset. Then put a repeater on VAC  to repeat the game audio to VAC  which was what I used in Skype as my input. Then I repeated VAC  to VAC  to give him my voice. As well as repeating VAC  to VAC  to give me his voice. That way through a ton of tweaking we managed to get an acceptable and immediate share of the screen and audio from the game without hearing ourselves in any way.

Your voice is comfortable not likable but comfortable you know. It doesnt sound annoying but not funny either. Thats a good point since if you have a funny voice you will have to use it well or it will counter you.  Your commentary is good. Its not really funny or it is because I didnt watch the whole video I stopped at the th or th minute but the good thing is its not boring either. You are not trying to become funny. Instead you do it your own way. Like talking about the game etc. I like it.   Now outside of that video since Im intrigued because you guys seem like working hard for your channel makes me remember of myself  years ago. You have nice design for your channel.

Only criticism here is levels the game mostly because its old midi sound is quite piercing so could be a bit lower so you come through clearer.I really like the intro explaining all the things and what youre aiming to do is cool.You seem to lose steam a little as the video goes on so maybe be aware of that and try to make sure youre either ok with periods of not a lot being said or that youre constantly explaining all the things thats happening or why youre doing things either way keep your voice up if that makes sense.Also close facebook before you record In general it looks good though,letsplay,corfm16,2,t5_2qss1

3387796,0,t1_cpeejvq, Design CYour channel art and avatar are fine although Id like to see a short blurb on your banner explaining something about your channel. Your thumbnails on the other hand.... I dont care for them. The overlayed giant yellow text kind of puts me off and theyre done in a style that is very very similar to lots and lots of other videos. A lot of this is just my personal opinion so take it with a grain of salt but Id consider revamping them a bit. Also it took me a while to find your recent uploads section. I would definitely recommend putting that one first in the list. Commentary BI watched your most recent Hotline Miami. Once again your commentary isnt really my style... but it was wellexecuted and entertaining. You were animated and engaged which is great.  Quality AThis is where your channel really shines in my opinion. Your audio quality is fantastic and your video quality is pretty good too. Your voice makes me reconsider my marriage not really but great job nonetheless. Reliability AAs far as I can tell you upload daily. Thats exactly what reliability is about... finding a schedule and maintaining it. Subscriber Interaction BYou do a great job of replying to comments and I can see your Twitter account is reasonably active when it comes to reaching out to other people and interacting there. You do a good job of talking to your audience at the start and end of the videos... but I think you could improve interaction in the video itself. Ask questions for people to answer in the comments. Ask for their opinions of the game. Tell them a story and ask them to share a similar one. You get the idea. Personality Promotion amp SEO DI dont like the category personality. What the heck does that mean? How do I grade you as a person and human being? So Im not going to. Im changing the category to Promotion and SEO and I hate to say it but your SEO is bad. Not only are you not making use of your tag and video description space your titles leave a lot to be desired as well. How are people supposed to find your video when you have these tags gtlets play Hotline Miami  Wrong Number Video Game Video Game CultureVideo Game Culture? Who is searching for Video Game Culture and is going to watch a Hotline Miami video? And who searches for just the term lets or play? You have way more space make use of it. The same goes for your video descriptions you should try and work in as many searchable terms as possible while still using complete sentences. And for titles you want searchable terms such as Lets Play in the title and you want the important searchable stuff up front.On a more positive note youre using Twitter as an avenue of promotion. On a notsopositive note youre doing a lousy job of it. Hashtags and developer accounts are your friends! Put those in there when you publish your videos from Youtube. Theres a box for it on the upload screen. Niche do you have a special quality BWell you do a lot of horror games I see. You like to have big reactions and an overthetop style which look staged to me not that its necessarily a bad thing. You use a facecam... um... Im not really sure. I dont think youre really breaking any new ground here but then again very few of us are. OVERALL BThere are lots of things youre doing well but theres always room for improvement. In your case the biggest area is SEO. Learn it love it live it. You have excellent consistency and quality and your commentary is wellexecuted and genuinely entertaining... even if its nothing groundbreaking. Overall good job especially when taking into consideration the relatively short amount of time your channel has been around. I rate you a solid B.

You also have a good about page! The fact that your subscriber number is hidden really bothers me.Your long video length is also a personal turn off no way in hell I have time to watch  minute Lets Plays. Just a personal opinion of course. Commentary A Delqhic delves into Savage Lands Very nice. Kept me engaged and interested even in a  minute video. I dont personally like watching a video that is entirely commentary on the game I would like to hear a little bit more jokes or banter about random things.  Quality BI noticed small screen tears in your Savage Lands video. Coulve just been the game. I didnt like hearing your sync in the most recent Binding of Isaac intro. Your audio quality is good. Reliability AYou are keeping to your loose schedule. It works. Subscriber  Interaction NAI couldnt seem to find a video with comments which sucks  Personality BBecause of your style of commentary I dont know what your personality is. I barely hear from Delqhic I just hear you explaining the game. Niche CYou are good at what you do but what you do is common. I cant seem to find any stand out features that separate you from everyone else.Overall B Youre good but you are simply explaining what you see and do. I would like to see a little bit more of you and your personality.If you need more info or help improving just message me.Please make sure to grade either my channel or someone elses in the thread.

3496644,0,t1_cpqtpba,It should do yes that is if its similar to other capture cards. The problem youll have is the white focus box will always be there. See youre not actually recording with the camera all the camera is doing is sending the picture from the screen to the capture device. So you dont even hit the record button on the camera that would just start recording to the SD card.I actually bought a capture card and was going to do it this way as well but it was too much faffing about. So heres what I did instead. Format my SD card as exFAT Make the SD card bootable using EOScard application. Install Magic Lantern to SD card. Install Tragic Lantern to SD card.What this does is allows you to alter the bitrate of the video you are recording making the filesize much smaller and secondly it allows to you record videos larger than GB. There may be a min limit but I havent tested it. You could always stop recording at min and start recording again.So this lets you record directly using the camera or the EOS software like you were.

3511761,0,t1_cpsev20,First off you guys look like youre having a lot of fun. Thats always helpful. And the video quality is pretty good.Obviously youre already aware of the audio problems but I might add that on top of cutting and popping you also have a problem with peaking when you speaklaugh loudly. Its the kind of thing that can seriously cause someone to just insta click away especially people with really sensitive hearing. I know its hard to avoid and it happens sometimes in my videos I do a bit of screaming now and then but I try to just cut it out whenever it happens or at least go into audacity and tone the levels down as much as possible.Another couple of points might be You guys seem like youre having fun but you dont seem as energetic as I want to see in a youtube video that I personally watch. Maybe thats not what youre going for at all but a bit more oomph probably couldnt hurt.Additionally I might add that certain bits concerning things like someone microwaving ramen noodles kinda just turns the game into silent backdrop. Maybe if you had better mics and worked on your YouTuberadio voice you might be able to interest viewers with the force of your personality and humor. But if it were me especially so early in a video Id maybe consider focusing more on the game.Anyway I hope some of this is useful and good luck ,letsplay,cpskcd4,2,t5_2qss1

3550873,0,t1_cpwof7i,You are golden! It is only video that will desync. Audio timing stands alone from frame rate. The way I look at it is that I have a file that I need the program to display precisely . frames in one second and it will. But the next video will need to be displayed at  times a second to stay synchronous with its audio. But the program cannot display each on its own framerate so I have to resample my fps down to .Note I resample my webcam footage as to preserve my gameplay footage,letsplay,cpx0trl,1,t5_2qss1
3551200,0,t1_cpwngx1,Im not exactly sure but I think that you can use the normalization too to make the volume consistent across your videos.  When you normalize it will ask you what decibel range you want the audio to be averaged around by default its at db.  Thats always the last step I take after my audio is mixed and it turns out pretty consistent.As for the game audio I dont really mix it at all. I just put both it and the spoken audio tracks in the editing software and lower the volume of the game sounds where they are quiet enough to still be heard without overbearing your vocals.  How quiet you make it is really up to you and will vary from game to game.  ,letsplay,cpx261b,1,t5_2qss1

Providing some insight into how you feel about the game and making some comparisons to your real life or other subjects should make your commentary a lot more natural Another complaint is your audio.

3586747,0,t3_31dg5t,I have bleeped myself before because in my own head it can add a comedic effect. And its said that if a channel wants to have a chance at doing well being family friendly is key because its easier to share a video without cursing.But like a lot of people I swear all the time in real life so I tend to do so in videos as well even though Im not even speaking my mother tongue in them. I personally dont think swearing is a bad thing but it can seem improper in some situations but in all honesty swearing in gaming videos is just fine by my standards.I dont know that its necessary to censor yourself. Dont make it into you having to stop and think about something to say instead of a curse word. I notice in some of my videos that Ive done that but Im trying to stay away from that as much as I can. If anything there are royalty free sound effects just like theres music so those usually offer something to use as a bleep.I would censor the words you put in the OP and I honestly I wouldnt say them at all. I just dont. I know theyre just words just like curse words but honestly I generally dont say anything racist homophobic or sexist. I have made sexist jokes before but its so clear that its a joke that it just cannot be misinterpreted. I have also made religious jokes. If you cant say discuss or joke about a religion any religion you cant discuss or joke about any religion at all. Thats my view and as a nonreligious person I have cracked a joke or two on the matter. But again make clear its for comedic effect. Same goes for politics. I generally dont discuss the matter because I have... unusual views on the matter according to most of the people on this side of the globe and so I would never bring up my own views. But I have cracked jokes about Murica and such before. But again with the comedic effect... comes into play quite a lot.I think its fine to say a lot of things as long as people instantly realize that its not harmfully intended. Just try to steer away from obviously hurtful things like racism homophobia and sexism and youll be fine. You dont want to be seen as a frequent racist homophobe or sexist. What you think is your private matter but heres a saying I heard from a bigger YouTuber. On YouTube be the best version of yourself. You are in the public eye.,letsplay,cq1488x,1,t5_2qss1

As Lets Play content creators we are definitely reliant on the goodwill of the games companies. And anyway your only real way to fight this is presumably to lawyer up and that wouldnt end well.Instead you could try to contact the developer apologize say that you used the video in good faith and under fair use but didnt mean harm and respect that they disagree  and if they could perhaps please remove the strike against you and provide you with their guidelines in what they consider OK to post and what not youd be very happy to work with them being a fan of their games etc. Dont grovel DEFINITELY dont be cheeky or aggressive be professional.

First channel disappeared wont get into that and my current channel I stopped uploading for a LONG time. I can tell you from personal experience that either way has its pros and cons. Starting fresh means thinking of a new name or persona. Just revamping your channel means creating a new image. Both arent impossible but take work and may not succeed. I personally feel just revamping your current channel is the way to go. You can keep your old videos and just set them to private. Or keep them public so that when you receive new fans they see your journey and how far youve come and the old fans still know where to find you.Either way good luck to you.

3958425,0,t3_35sf2b,If you are doing Lets Plays I really believe that commentary is a given a must. Anyone can play the game for themselves but what we do is entertainment. While its true there are some people who might watch just game play in my experience the wider audience watches for the personality. As far as how to go about it it is honestly a learning process. You have to try before you can succeed. The more you do it the more you will feel comfortable with it and eventually you will develop your own style or take on one of the ones floating around. In the beginning there will be a lot of pauses in your commentary and it can be frustrating. My advice is to look up as much as you can on the game. Write down cool little trivia facts or neat things about the developers Blizzard on a piece of paper then when you find yourself running out of things to say bring one of those topics up. Dont just list them though talk about them. Give your opinions and thoughts on them. While this will come easy with time I suggest trying to be as open as possible. Sadly these days we are forced behind a wall called the internet which can cause us to put up something of a social bubble. Try and break through that. We tend to be more in with our thoughts I actually saw a TED Talk about a guy going offline for a year and he said he became more emotionally available. Try to be more open with your commentary dont be afraid to be silly and be perceptive about things in the game. If you find something interesting or funny embrace it make a joke out of it or talk about why you think its interesting. Oh and always remember when in doubt make a dick joke. Hope this helped at least a little bit.,letsplay,cr7hsue,1,t5_2qss1

Ive never seen anyone argue that black history is somehow more important or praiseworthy than white history. In no instance is celebrating a minority a tacit dismissal of the majority.And he followed that up with the assertion that race has nothing to do with the wealth distribution in America. Or at least not today. Either way I think thats been pretty systematically proven otherwise like repeatedly. Like I said before celebrity I cant take him anymore seriously talking about race issues than I would take Gwyneth Paltrow talking about steaming her vagina.Im sure if Morgan Freeman saw the amount of bullshit his words were used to justify hed regret having said them. Ive seen people use that as some sort of bizarre proof that racism doesnt exist anymore. Or to justify this weird entitled shit where they feel like they need to be included or that there needs to be a balancing white history month to justify it. Its weird and it ignores the fact that there are still people out there who feel marginalised because of their race. Back on subject I have met girls who felt patronised by similar efforts to publicise their presence in both film slightly unrelated and YouTube gaming channels. The point they seemed to have missed was that those efforts really werent about overtly praising them for achieving something on par with a boy but to encourageenlighten others.Maybe that knowledge would help moderate a teenage boy who genuinely thinks girls shouldnt be part of his hobby? At least it might contribute to a positive effect. Or it could encourage other women who may have felt ostracised by an ostensibly male dominated scene.When I first saw the article headline I rolled my eyes. When I read it however and saw that it was simply a harmless attempt at highlighting some decent Lets Players who are women because women are sometimes othered in gaming culture I was okay with it. Still a crap title though.,letsplay,crhwdk0,-1,t5_2qss1

Usually people quantify this with subscriber counts view counts etc.  When you are just starting out  subs is a great goal.

4260796,0,t1_cs4x1km,Good day to you sir just finished watching your video and here are my thoughts.Overall the video was good but not great it did get a bit boring in the middle but the beginning was interesting and informative and the end with your death montage was entertaining to watch.  Youve certainly got the commentary abilities as well as the editing skills to do a Lets Play well I think it may just be the game.  Its lack of story minimalistic visuals twitch reflex gameplay and the repetitive trialanderror nature of the game makes it difficult to comment on I personally try to avoid games like this unless Ive already mastered them.  I dont think you should give up LPs yet try another game first Id be interested in seeing you take on something with a little more substance to it.  Alternatively and I dont usually suggest this but perhaps you should consider making a reviewfirst impressions type show instead of traditional Lets Plays.  You did an excellent job explaining the mechanics of the game describing how it feels to play and discussing both the pros and cons.  I felt like I had a really solid idea of what what the game was like within the first  minutes of your video and I think if you had gone straight from that into a montage of clips from later levels and then to a closing statement it would have made for an excellent review of PewPewRecoil.Thats my thoughts anyway.  Hope this feedback helps best of luck in the future and have a great weekend! ,letsplay,cs5wsmt,1,t5_2qss1

Im thinking Jack from Achievement hunters level of energy could brighten up the commentary.I agree with Waistel youre commenting on reddit and mad max but those should only really be mentioned as a quick aside and get back to whats going on and the game youre playing. You might want to consider doing jump cuts and editing to keep out nonfocused stuff and long gaps.

4412989,0,t1_csn1kik,Heyo so I looked at your channel I can say I like your logo. Though your banner is quite plain and I feel there could be a bit more synergy with the logo and banner. I can see youve been updating your thumbnail style as you go and I definitely like the newest ones youve put out. The giant white text on the image there can probably be a way to spice that up and maybe not have the text take up so much of the image. It makes it harder to appreciate the what the image actually is. Like for example you have two mount your friends videos of recent and its difficult to tell them apart just from the thumbnail which is doing you a disservice really. Your editing style seems pretty alright you make the videos nice short and sweet though I personally prefer longer videos cause I want to sit back and relax and not have to change the video every  minutes though that could just be me. One final minor thing is on your videos you dont have an intro you just jump right into the thick of things.

4451485,0,t3_3c2ku1,If youre worried about surprising your subscribers with a lot of content dont be. Thats a good thing. People who actually watch and enjoy your content will be happier with you releasing more material. Maybe not  videos a day but releasing even twice a day isnt too much for LP channels.Not getting exhausted yourself is a different issue though. I think the thing to keep in mind for yourself is to do what is fun. Dont stress yourself out on making content that isnt fun for you but it gets videos out. Play games you enjoy and have fun. Another thing to do is interact with the community and with your subscribers. Seeing people interact with you and your work at least for me is one of the most encouraging things that keeps me going. I think if its something you love then you will be just fine.Also Id say try starting off with a lighter schedule and build up if you think you can fit more in.

Check out this guys banner artHes got the same sunburst look but it has some depth to it. My guess is that he took a similar sunburst PNG with transparency threw a darker blue background behind it and added a drop shadow to the top layer. You might try something similar.The Layer FX panel in Photoshop always helps sweeten things for me. I can lay down a drop shadow maybe use bevel and emboss only on text and put an outer glow around it as well. Check out some Youtube tutorials on it. Theres no onesizefitsall approach with Photoshop but if you see something that looks good copy the style.Only other thing I notice is that the box art for the games seems a little small.

4516685,0,t1_cszyqz8,gtI think that its a risk we are willing to take. Just looking at the recommended channels right now it already shows a couple of our gaming friends and thats the purpose of it. Yes it does show bigger names as well but if we can get the names of guys we like as well its worth it. The off chance we get noticed somewhere else is an added benefit tooId respectfully disagree with this notion. If your gaming friends are people that dont have a lot of subscriptions themselves and arent having people subscribe to them regularly then the benefit youre talking about wont show up very often since thats the only time youll get the benefit. You can get the names of guys you like but for attentions sake even if you like that user youre trying to work on building up your own channel so dont show this other user the extra attention and divert that from your own content especially early on. The offchance you get noticed is more than outweighed by the cost you pay in the form of having bigger names plastered on the side of your page. The noticability really only benefits people with more viewership which is exactly why its set there by default. If you want others seeing your channel from other channels you should get linked directly which not only shows the channel more often but doesnt involve paying the cost of posting larger channels on you own.gtIf you watched our videos and got a sense of our humor and style the tag lines works perfectly to capture who we are. There are other words that better capture that like casual relaxed or non of that MLG shit or anything. When I saw poorly and going from the impression you gave me even unconsciously it gives the impression that you dont care about your video quality.

He is highly racist against elves and blames them and magic for the state of the world. He believes in the power of the dragonborn and believes in his destiny but doesnt feel worthy of it.

The people who last now are doing it as a passion and learning what it takes to maintain sustainable growth.There are some other communities growing out of this. I see alot of the harder working ones work pretty well under the letsplay tag on twitter and theres an entire subreddit for very communal learning and growth under rkrofam. Has its ups and downs but is usually very welcoming to people who want to truly work at it and not just look at it as a for money thing. ,letsplay,ctq2h8u,1,t5_2qss1
4726374,0,t3_3fnkn8,Im certainly not the authority on giving advice but I can offer a few things. Be yourself.  Its good to have people to look up to and people to admire such as fellow Lets Players but its also important to find your own style.  It may take some time to figure out what that will be but be patient and act natural.  Youll find your stride.. Be patient but diligent.  It takes time for a channel to grow but sometimes you can certainly help things along.  Im not too concerned with channel growth myself but if you want to obtain that kind of growth become an active member in forums like this where its easy to put your work out there and gain exposure feedback and advice.  Become active in social media and keep your subscribers up to date with new videos and updates.  Be active but stay patient and the rewards will follow.. Keep challenging yourself to get better or at least maintain a high quality in your videos.  Interacting here will expose you to lots of information about programs technology etc.  Keep an open mind you can always learn something new.  If you want to try something else out to improve or are looking for tips or tricks on a new program bounce it off the lovely responsive community here.  We are in this together to have a good time and try to figure out how to pump out the best stuff we can.. Have fun.  Please have fun.  Its okay to become obsessive about viewssubschannel growthetc. all of us fall victim to constant refreshes on our channel page to see what the updates will be.  But dont let that stuff affect your attitude.  You are doing this to have a good time.  If you put yourself out there and enjoy it your viewers will be able to acknowledge that.  And you may meet some friends along the way who you can even team up with on some projects.  Its awesome if you make some extra money along the way too but if this isnt your full time job dont get too caught up in all that.  TLDR be yourself be patient work hard challenge yourself have fun.,letsplay,ctqasp4,2,t5_2qss1

Also the music and sound levels of the live action parts were off from the rest of the video. Run a normalization over the whole track or listen to see audio levels.

4792852,0,t3_3ghoxr,Looks like Im a bit late on this but Ill go ahead and add my own thoughts on them. Personally Id go with neither and will be adding in a third option. But first to elaborate on why Id go neither with OBS nor DXTory.DXTory This has great quality and a nice amount of options. I cant argue against those points at all. However the fact that even using lagarith lossless which is the best codec available for the program eats up around .gbs a minute makes it to where I cant justify it despite the fact my main drive is a TB drive and I have another slave TB. OBS While its free great for livestreaming and has relatively small file sizes compared to DXT I cant recommend it simply because of how much of a pain in the ass it is to set it up properly. Granted this may just be a personal complaint but it is what it is. Now then for the program I actually do recommend Mirilis Action!. Its a fairly easy to use program records in high quality can record multiple audio channels can easily record desktop cropped areas as well as games of course has a ton of options includes livestreaming capability and has very good file sizes especially if you use the same codec that is used by shadowplay which will be detected immediately. Yes it costs some money to obtain but if youre serious now about doing videos or decide you want to get serious about it later down the line I cant recommend this program enough. I have had no complaints since I started using it. ,letsplay,ctyof5j,1,t5_2qss1

4869950,0,t3_3hljq5,When youre starting out the best thing to focus on is just getting your style down. Try to figure out what creative choices you want to make like are you going to have a corner can? Small amount of editing heavy editing? How long to make each episode? I think its more important to increase production values and make yourself a brand than to upload regularly.So in short I think you should upload as often as possible to get the most practice you can with the video making process. Try new styles and see what works for you Also you might want to make your videos shorter  minutes is a long time to commit for a new viewer and potential subscriber. I would try to keep them down in the  minute range which is a more average episode time for lets plays.Good luck my friend and if youd like to post a link to your YouTube channel Ill definitely check it out!

5082048,0,t3_3kl7th,If youre happy with how you sound right now you can safely ignore the critic. Im assuming the rest of your audience is perfectly fine with your voice and you might not want someone like that as one of your regular viewers anyway. That said...Voices can and do change even well into adulthood. I sounded like a completely different person  years ago when I started making videos regularly. I never really had any voice critics other than myself but every time Id record something and listen back to it Id pick out something I wanted to change and try to do that thing differently or better the next time I recorded. With a lot of iteration I got smoother and less nasal and adjusted my pronunciation cadence and intonation for a much more pleasing sound.The important question is what you think of your voice. The I think I sound awful bit makes it sound like you might be interested in improving. Lets plays are a form of regular public speaking practice which is exactly whats necessary for improvement.The point isnt to stop sounding like you and adopt someone elses way of speaking its to refine and iterate on your own unique sound so you can become a better version of you.,letsplay,cuykvup,1,t5_2qss1

5136275,0,t3_3lc1dw,As a separate issue from the whole stickying debacleI would like to echo what a few other folks have been saying so far I see a significantly greater volume of vitriol for the larger Lets Players in this subreddit than I do blind praise.  Its not a welcoming environment for people who are not within their first year or two of content creation and thats reflected in the demographics of the people who spend their time here.Channels above a certain threshold tend to gravitate away from this subreddit because  they have nothing left to really learn  they have nothing to gain by being here and  people are routinely nasty to anyone with a modicum of success and seem to actively fight back against advice given by people who actually know a thing or two as opposed to people wanting to dish out advice when they only have a hundred or so subscribers themselves.We basically kicked Markiplier out two years ago.  Over tags.  Thats really sad.This sub has a bizarre habit of being elitist about not being the elite.  People are proud of not being PewDiePie or not being Jacksepticeye etc. when really those should be the people we look to the most for pointers on how to be successful at this very difficult very competitive game.  Im not saying anyone should be imitating them but try to understand the choices they make they ways they present themselves the manners in which they network and apply that to your own channel.  Stop taking advice from people who have no business doling out advice.  Im gonna come out and say it Ive spent the vast majority of this year debating leaving rLetsPlay.  Ive made my networking connections Ive learned just about all I can from here and all I seem to be able to do here now is set up Unsucky Sunday and occasionally handle trolls and linkdumps.  We regurgitate the same questions week after week whats wrong with normal conversation?  I want this place to be more worthwhile for me and I want this place to be more worthwhile for you.In short Criticism is good.  Empathy is good.

5146126,0,t1_cv65vvc,Good day to you sir!  I watched both your Shower Simulator video and your Mad Max video and here are my thoughts.On a technical side youre pretty great.  Both audio and video quality are top notch face cam is synced up and your editing skills while simplistic are effective and get the job done.  My only minor complaint would be that your face cam seems a bit small and you arent really facing towards the camera which I dont think is a good practice for reasons Ill mention in the next section.  Overall though excellent job.On the entertainment side of things you were above average but you could use a bit of work. On the plus side your videos were both well paced.  You had a lot of energy with no dead air and you edited them very well never once was I bored or wondering how much longer the video was going to go on which is an excellent start.  Youve also got a fairly distinctive style your simple name and vulgar opening really caught my attention and your unapologetic swearing is a bit refreshing and memorable in an age where most people stick to the occasional fuck or shit but otherwise keep things pretty tame.Unfortunately that same quality made you a bit difficult to watch at times particularly in the Mad Max episode theres a point where you let loose a stream of obscenities which where entirely derogatory towards women for some reason using slut whore and cunt repeatedly and it came across as more awkward and mean spirited than the rest of your light hearted shenanigans.  Now I wouldnt recommend you cuss less since it is part of your charm but maybe try to make it more over the top so its not as harsh and more hilarious string together obscenities that people would never use call someone a shit fisting bitch midget or something else ridiculous like that or at the very least just try to throw in some variety to keep things fresh.Also theres the mater of your face cam.  Generally people have them so that they can show off their facial reactions andor talk directly to the viewers and while you did talk to the viewer a little bit at the beginning of your videos it otherwise went pretty underutilized and I rarely found myself looking at it.  I blame most of this on the fact that your face cam is smaller the most LPers Ive seen tucked away in the top right corner and you arent really facing towards it most of the time you were almost entirely in profile so it was difficult to read your expression. If you want to get the most out of your face cam Id strongly recommend increasing the size of your face and positioning the camera so that its closer to your monitor.So overall a good job you have some rough patches but youre doing a lot right and youve got potential.  Keep working at it and Im sure youll see improvement.  Anyway hope this feedback helps best of luck in the future and have a great weekend  ,letsplay,cv6aur1,2,t5_2qss1

As a viewer I dont mind watching a video without a facecam or at least I prefer it.

5373307,0,t3_3okr58,Man. So I released our newest video on Friday to a... well no response really. The only people that have watched it are all the members of The ClassyCast plus a couple of others. Not a biggie though as its an unpopular game. Luckily we breeze through the rest of it so I should be able to end out the series in a month or two.Our Kerbal Space Program series got off to a roaring start relatively the week before that and were looking to record episode two this week. Yeah this week. That means Niah and I will have three whole days to get it finished by Friday evening. A speed edit if Ive ever heard of one. Meanwhile I need to start on the eighth episode of Lords of the Fallen which releases next Friday. Ugh! So much to do so little time to do it.We intend on recording something new this week but Im not sure if itll work out. Recording new things rarely works for us since everyones usually busy and our schedules are all over the place. Oh well we make due where we can.We also plan on doing something for halloween and we plan on introducing a themed series that weve been planning for awhile. Intro and whatnot is already made for it just need game footage!Man I still remember the scariest game for me. Thief Deadly Shadows the third one. About halfway through the game you come to a level called The Cradle. Its a mental hospital that used to be an orphanage. Sounds great right? Well I manage to sneak my way in moving about a millimeter every minute. Im scared to death of this place. The ambience is insanely well done. I eventually come to this narrow staircase that leads to the attic. The whole time theres the knocking sound that gets louder and louder as Im going up. At the end theres a closed wooden door. The pounding is at its loudest. I open the door and... nothing. Not a damn thing. Doesnt help that I was playing the game at  AM with the lights turned off wearing headphones.I havent really played a scary game sense. Far too scared to.

5374994,0,t3_3on7v0,Btw dont beat yourself up or put your traits down. Use what you know of yourself to your advantage. I came back to post again since there were a few other things you asked I never got to respond to. For sounding genuine just act like you are talking to a good friend! I did a small goofy trick for myself anytime I record I keep a bobble heard below the mic to make it feel like Im talking to someone. Just a thought I do. But as all things come practice practice practice. I already have seen a huge different and boost in my quality and commentary from my first episodes to now. Games I have a bit more option since I record computer games and consoles games. I say play what you want but also look for fun new games others might be searching for and wanting to watch. Study trends etc. Im still working on this since Im super stubborn and love playing whatever I want. Does it hurt me getting more subs potentially. I let my content do the talking in that sense. When you have the footage and how you edit is really up to you. Do want to do full raw Lets Plays? Or do you want to do heavily edited videos depending on the style of game you play? For me I do heavy edits for one offs or goofy games and cut less in games I want the viewers to enjoy primarily instead of silly edits and effects. I try to balance that style between the two. Again...your choice. No one can tell you to do one over the other. Button clicks dont annoy me as long as it doesnt overpower your voice or the game etc. Theres plenty of audio programs that can help you edit or reduce some of those things like Audacity. Some people play with a towel over their hands too! This really can help reduce clicks if thats something you worried about. In terms of other things I say have a good HDD that writes info fast enough to maintain frame rates and video quality. Or if you planning on doing a webcam looking into good brands. Really depends on your style of Lets Play!,letsplay,cvypss8,1,t5_2qss1

5534325,0,t3_3qvqza,Here are  big tips to staying motivated and keeping your ideas flowing I am a musiciansongwriter and I am employed as the head of the creative department at my church. The toll it can take on a creative mind is pretty intense. Here are the things that Ive learned to keep myself motivated and to keep creativity flowing  these things have been super helpful thus far in my lets play channel. Stay inspired  this means be a consumer of the art. The first thing that tends to happen when we start creating is that we stop consuming  but this is like trying to run a race and never rehydrating. My biggest piece of advice is totally in agreement with emiknightly  watch tons of great lets plays!. Change your surroundings. Where do you usually playrecordcome up with your ideas? Change it up! Play a game in a busy shopping mall... Do something totally different... something unheard of for gamers  go for a jog! The creative side of our brain thrives on a state of rest so engaging in a new activity in a new surrounding gives the lets play part of your brain a break and youll find that some of your best ideas will come when you werent thinking about subscribers analytics or making that next video. . Go to your happy place Where were you when you came up with your best idea? Recreate that to the best of your ability. This may sound like a contradiction with  but it is actually more like a repetition of . Chances are that your best ideas come when youre letting your brain rest creatively. In the shower driving in your car going for a walk etc. For me the best songs Ive written and some of the better concepts Ive had for our channel have come while Im driving. I dont know why but it just does. So I make sure I have a way of recording my ideas while I drive. . Get someone to hold you accountable. Find some other lets players or a friend to encourage you and help you not give up. being a part of this community has already helped me a lot. . I dont remember where I heard this but its a good one the feeling that your work  is subpar is a REALLY GOOD THING. It means that your taste is good. Every artists journey is simply an effort to get their work to catch up to their taste. Keep creating amass a larger and larger body of work and youll start to see your quality of work begin to catch up to your taste. . Copy someone. Now before people start yelling at me hear me out. Im not saying just do what other Youtubers are doing. Im not telling you to not be yourself. What I am saying is this  dont worry so much about where youre taking the idea from  focus on where youre going to take it to. Get ideas from other great Lets Players add your personality and your flavor to it and give it a shot. Youll be surprised by what you learn. Remember  nothing is original. Everyone is copying someone  if you lean into that and embrace it youll take a lot of pressure off of yourself and the creativity and motivation will flow a lot easier. . Dont quit! Power through it. Just like seasons change so does the ebb and flow of creativity. Youll eventually come out of it and when you do you will be glad you stuck to your guns. Youll be glad you continued to crank out content. I hope this stuff helps  its definitely helped me in a lot of different areas of life. Lets Plays are an art form and writers block is a very real very common  yet very treatable  ailment among artists. Best of luck to you!,letsplay,cwj24mk,5,t5_2qss1

But there is  alternate options to the rd party programs he uses.You should be able to simply go to your playback settings.Select one to be the main playback device and the other to the the main communication device.From Dxtory you could then assign these as separate tracks. The issue is this though..... this plays as two separate outputs. One in the back one in the front headphone amp speaker. This sounds complicated but its really not. Its all analog and avoids other software.You can either have an earbud out for the skype along with your regular headset for the gameplay OR. run both outputs with Male to Male .mmin cables into a inout female .mmin cables and have a single headsetheadphone.,letsplay,cwn8dap,2,t5_2qss1

5680160,0,t1_cx0wkhe,What kind of mic are you using? What editing software are you using?Your audio quality is lacking in terms of voice recording. It could improve especially your friends.Character creation is very iffy. Most people would rather you skip it because its all personal preference. I played Fallout  and showed the character creation because it had an entertainment value.Personally I am not interested in this sort of game. That is just an opinion.What is your goal in this video? Im not sure I understand a greater motive behind it. It just seems like youre playing a game and posting it online with no incentive for an audience to continue watching. Your thumbnails could improve. Although it is clever to use your name to tell the audience that its not really an error it doesnt have an impact. Why would people want to click something that says error when there is this other more appealing picture that informs them on what to expect. Actually your channel art could use a makeover as well.Have you considered social media outlets? They help bridge an audience as well as gather one.Showing faces is another great way to bridge an audience. However that is optional.,letsplay,cx16hnr,1,t5_2qss1

5841354,0,t1_cxlb2k4,gt  Played it found the reddit relevant to the game went from  subs to   .Now this is a weird one to me. I never post my videos on reddit. Or anywhere. Well aside from rlpcritiques occasionally. I have so few subscribers! Ive tried literally nothing and Im all out of ideas!I hate to say this especially here but whenever I see posts on various gamerelated subreddits that are just LPs or twitch stream announcements or whathaveyou I immediately downvote them. Youll notice that those posts generally seem to have no comments and no score. People just completely ignore them at best until they slide off the front page of that particular subreddit.Maybe ten years ago LPs used to be pretty rare and actually meaningful. But now that everyone can record and stream video LP posts can seriously clutter up a gaming subreddit to the point of making it impossible to read actual discussion about the game. Theyre almost as bad as memes.I have only ever seen one game just one that had a Call for videosLPs! post stickied on it. The developer even reached out to me personally to talk about fixing bugs I found in my video of the game and offered me some game keys.It was a very niche very indie game though not a mainstream commercial game. Generally youll find that most gaming subreddits that even accept LP posts are so low traffic that it doesnt even really matter if you post at all.Sorry. Im sorry Im just.... rambling I guess.

I set my upload default to private so that when I do make the video public it shows up at that exact time in the subscribers feed. Scheduling the video is just like keeping it private and when the designated time you set comes it will appear in your subscribers feed at that current time. Youll want your videos to appear to your subscribers in a noticeable time frame if you set your video to unlisted and you uploaded a video  days ago it will appear in your subscribers feed as  days ago they might miss it.EDIT setting it to private also helps set it in the correct order of when they go public rather than when they were uploaded for playlists and what not. ,letsplay,cxynxsu,1,t5_2qss1

6178749,0,t3_406oaj,There are a few publishers who do not like their games being shown even if they are not monetized. Some people will tell you Oh its fine because of fair use. but the fact of the matter is that fair use is a very gray area in terms of Lets Plays.Statistically the chance of getting in trouble for using nonmonetized game material is low however there is still a risk. I play it safe by contacting publishers andor look for their policies online. Additionally I find it more beneficial to contact them some of them even offer to showcase material through their social media affiliations if they find it to be good enough Capcom. Then again some of them give unclear contradictory statements SEGA. The real down side is this process can take a while before you get a reply.TLDRWhile the chance of getting in trouble is low for nonmonetized content it is still present. As I tell everyone you may want to look into the copyright holders policies for the game.,letsplay,cyryjxv,2,t5_2qss1
6179128,0,t3_406oaj,Thanks for the info guys! This is a new hobby of mine I just want to have some fun and avoid any possible trouble in the process! Very inspired by all the lets plays and game channels I watch I figured hell why not try it out myself.,letsplay,cys03np,1,t5_2qss1
6184766,0,t3_409gwj,I mean its up to you. Mileage may very kind of deal. In my personal opinion I dont mind a super short one sometimes they become iconic to the channel like the Sips horn. Its short and you know its Sips. Long ones though... I recently watched a JonTron video for the first time and I thought How is this guy big I feel like I watched an entire video and it was just the intro.. Its very much I might watch one of his videos now and then but I aint binge watching that if I have to skip the intro all the time. But yeah thats just me. I dont mind some of the longerish ones. uHelixGaming has a longer one where it shows a funny preview clip to look forward to and grab your attention followed by what Id say is a  second intro off the top of my head then into the video. While not my favorite format it still works and I dont dislike it. ujustskylarkin has a nice short one where its sound and picture. Pretty much like Sips and doesnt detract from the video at all.Also one thing I see is Oh intro I already know who Im watching if Im on your channel and hey thats a fair point for regulars but if you want to grow then it can be very helpful. You know when you turn auto play on and it starts playing similar videos because YouTube put them at the top of the list? An intro helps that person know who you are and gives a chance at leaving an impression in their mind so they will remember you. Thats in the first  seconds. Its rather amazing isnt it? I think people forget at times intros and outros arent really for the regulars. It sounds kind of mean because you should care for the people that care about you but yknow what? There are other ways to care for the regulars. You can have running jokes with them provide them with content references they will get engage in conversation with them all sorts. Hopefully your fans understand that you still want to grow though and thus why you might have an intro or an outro or maybe both if youre really bold. It gives you a chance to grab new fans and subscribers. I just think that sometimes that idea is lost on people because they want the convenience of seamless episodes for their playlist binges. Anyways my thoughts went on a bit. To end with my personal opinions again. Pick either an Intro or an Outro. Dont try get greedy with both straight away. If one works think of easing in the other. Keep them short. Intros definitely less than  seconds less than  seconds is optimal. Outros no longer than  minute  seconds. Give yourself a time limit for both if using both. Say  in total. So if you have a  second intro you can only have  for an outro. Trial and error to find out whats best because Im half throwing out random numbers. LISTEN to what YOUR fans are saying whether through analytics or comments. HOWEVER remember if youve edited the video in YouTube with annotations and what not and given yourself  second views or else you might think your intros are repelling people when it reality it was just you looking at a copyright claim or something.Anyways good luck!,letsplay,cysn6na,2,t5_2qss1

6226885,0,t3_40v68a,Fortunetly i havent had this yet. I know its comming i dont when and i dont know where but it will kill me inside...lol. na seriously though its going to hurt. Take what you can from them and learn. mainly learn not to sink to there level. They are doing it for attention and for those reasons they should also not be ignored since they are going to keep doing it till they get attention from you or your viewers and then feelings will get hurt somewhere. I learned how to deal with jerks when i worked at amazon. The worst call i had gotten was a guy telling me to kill myself blah blah blah. Best thing to do. is take it as a learning experience though. Pay close attention to what they didnt like. If its something you wont change because its not you or its not your style dont worry about it. But if you look at what they are saying and do see something to change give it a shot. People are going to be jerks no matter what its just human nature. Most people are good in our community though.  Chin up friend. Things get better. they always do. chances are your fan base will attack him in the future. i dont promote it. but it is always fun to see. plus loads of publicity if you think like a businessman.  but try to keep the peace. take each comment with a grain of salt and move on. some things you can learn from some you just gotta let happen. but dont give them what they are after. They are the same as hecklers in a comedy club. they just want to be attention W  Your doing awesome keep on truckin along. It will pass. ,letsplay,cyxfghp,1,t5_2qss1

6434795,0,t3_43set0,This is definitely what Id call a Fine mess.I like how they dont actually seem to be accepting any blame from this. They tried to obtain trademarks for all of these collections of words saying their intentions were pure but it sounds like theyre saying We totally wouldnt screw anyone over! Why wont you let us prove that? after having taken down a boatload of videos. Both their React World and Update videos were swept under the carpet and mirrors have already gone up thanks to other folks and the post saying that theyre rescinding all of this is posted on the Medium so theyre trying to avoid catching more flak than they already have done.The fun thing is whilst theyve lost a large number of active subscribers I think its k now their videos are still getting views with a boost thanks to the debacle theyre still making ludicrous amounts of money off of videos that theyve uploaded and any that theyve made claims on and their Update video had them passiveaggressively saying that content creators were the ones who dont understand whats going on even though said content creators would be in the firing line for possibly skimming close to their trademark. Seeing all the responses people have made about these two have not painted a lovely picture considering theyve gone after people who uploaded videos before they were around and even TV shows that loosely imitated the format. At the end of the day their names are mud but theyre still sitting pretty with healthy bank accounts.,letsplay,czkw9d9,2,t5_2qss1

6449935,0,t3_43yfaj,I think I found your channel through your post history if I found the wrong one disregard this post. Heres some problems I found. The games played on your channel FTL Binding of Isaac Alien Isolation Outlast Shadow of Mordor are all somewhat older and have been played by tons of other and bigger YouTubers  SEO and metadata is terribly handled. Tags should include more than the name of the game and avoid tags such as pro gameplay and misspelled things like walkhtrough as this will not help at all with people finding your videos. Descriptions seem to be nonexistent on the videos Ive checked which is a waste. Write good descriptions for your videos! Thumbnails look very generic and not appealing. It also seems some of the thumbnails you added are wrong when it comes to numbering e.g. two videos labeled  video  labeled as  in the thumbnail. Misspelling a game name on a thumbnail that already looks very bland is a mistake that you cant make either. Consistency is not good. This might not be important in acquiring new viewers but your subscribers have no reason to stick around. You cant just stop uploading a game for a month after uploading  or  parts. It makes no sense.These are just a few things that I noticed within minutes of checking your channel and you can bet that potential subscribers will do the same. Sorry if all this seems harsh but these are some things that are quite easy to fix and should be fixed before you complain about not getting any viewers. Again if this is not your channel then just disregard it and I just wasted a whole bunch of time writing this post but either way I feel these are some good points.Hope I helped!,letsplay,czmgpgo,1,t5_2qss1

Think like free games or cheap steam games that you can do. Try to find new ones but older ones can work too. A good game when it first appeared was Agario. Just keep looking around and always keep up to date on new games. If you know Minecraft well you could start making tutorials but youd have to do things others havent to get noticed on that.

6573448,0,t3_4567g9,Im going to agree with you on the part that LPs dont really get as many views. I do daily content of roguelikes and each video gets between  and k views because they are games you can just jump into see what the person is doing see where it might be going and leave. No investment on the viewers part. Watch or leave.  My LPs on the other hand were getting more on the order of  views. Why? I think the reason is when you are making something story based or at least a video where continuation is key to understanding what is happening most people dont want to make the time investment. I myself dont watch LPs anymore because I just dont want to sit down and watch  hours of a game I may or may not end up liking.The way I see it at least in my case most people sub and watch for the daily content and I hate phrasing it as such the real fans the ones that are watching it more for me and less for the content are the ones watching the full LPs.Kind of rambling here and I feel this is only my case but its my  cents on the topic lol.,letsplay,czz8z6y,2,t5_2qss1

And even though they took so long to make it seemed to work to some extend got a few thousand views on every new video and many nice comments but I could see the views decreasing which I was expecting anyway.  Im honest though I partly blame YouTube for it but not in the sense of Why am I not famous? like someone else was implying here but more like Why do you stop helping me out and instead promote other channels on my video only because I took a break and my video isnt as viral anymore?.

7112637,0,t1_d1m5trq,I think that the video was really good! Your mic audio sounded fine. Your general commentary was fine as well. The layoutoverlay was well done and is clear and visually appealing. The general tone of the video did feel a bit frantic between the cadence of your voiceabsolutely nothing wrong with that youre just a quick talker and the speeding through gameplay. Although with Nuzlockes frantic is somewhat thematically appropriate so...The background music was a bit distracting. I think the biggest problem was that the Pokemon music is a little bit aggravating when sped up. Your commentary was great but whenever the video would be sped up it was hard to pay attention to it over the wild midi bleeps in the background.  Fnally this is a SUPER minor critique and feel free to ignore it but the negative space at the bottom of your overlaybetween the thumbnails of your Pokemon and the bottom of the screen is smaller than the negative space at the topbetween the game capture screen and the top of the Youtube screen. Again really nitpicky but worth mentioning especially since I think the rest of the video was excellent! I think you did really well and its overall very professional.  ,letsplay,d1mly7u,2,t5_2qss1

7191048,0,t1_d1v0c6p,Hello I just finished watching your video and I thought it was fairly funny and enjoyable. The commentary actually reminds me of some other larger youtubers that I watch from time to time. As far as problems go I think the main issue I had was that some of you were kind of hard to hear during parts of the video. Regarding the video quality dips We also use OBS amp Premiere I cant think of any reason off the top of my head other than that it could be that your bitrate is very low or that when your video was exported from premiere you used CBR instead of VBR Passing  bitrate encoding which can result in drops in video quality in fast motion settings. Our editor probably knows better than I do but he isnt available at the moment of writing this. All and all though it was a good video and I look forward to watching more of your videos in the future.Edit Our editor thinks its probably low bitrate.,letsplay,d1vk82t,2,t5_2qss1

If you dont know what both of these are then I could explain that to you later because Im on mobile now or you just search this subreddit. There are a lot of great posts describing how to do both. I made one how to video for the game the culling which has k views now and its up for about a month now. That gave me a few subs but not very much. If you want to get a returning viewerbase you need to provide something on a regular basis. Recently I started my first weekly series where I show some mods that are new. That was uploaded yesterday and it got me  or  subs overnight which is crazy for me.

You want to wait  days to watch a play through   video a day? we are talking lets plays right not just someone playing a game or random videos but what if they release multiple episodes a day?? Then whats someones motive in releasing  x  min episodes rather than doing  x  min   hour episodes? I make lets plays because I like playing games and I DEFINITELY play them longer than min at a time Depends on the game I guess I play a lot of slower games nothing really happens inside the game in min and its immersion breaking to put out short episodes. ,letsplay,d1y8dsn,1,t5_2qss1

7239115,0,t3_4eksbx,I dont play Lethal League but I thought the cars looked more beefy and less like sports or racing cars? It just looks like a stock image from a racing game like a normal racing game so it confuses me. Its also incredibly symmetrical which is generally what people do as a safe thing but it comes out lacking personality when you do that.  I almost want to say you should play with and improve upon the first concept since it looks more unique than slapping a premade image with text as your banner. It also looks more interesting and fun! Try to keep going with the first one! It needs a bit of work but it has good potential! Its more creative than the second one imo as well so that is why I am rooting for it  Just play with the text placement. Dont be scared to rotate text! You can balance text out without it being symmetrical ,letsplay,d2119af,1,t5_2qss1

7242664,0,t3_4emo1n,My thoughts are that if somebody suffers serious mental trauma from watching someone play games they probably shouldnt be watching those videos to begin with. So no need for a trigger warning in that regard.If youre afraid your content might be distressing to some people you could also simply play games that dont cause them trouble. In which case no trigger warning would be needed as youve already taken that into account as far as your content goes.You could also simply edit out parts that seem unsavory to you. If you feel they might cause issues you can cut out that content.To me putting in a trigger warning seems redundant and a waste of your time especially given that from what Ive seen theres very little overlap between people who watch gaming videos and people who agree with the notion of trigger warnings. There arent a lot of people who actually read descriptions and about pages anyway so its not like itd even be seen by the people youre trying to warn.Personally I wouldnt do this at least for anything besides epilepsy again editing would be even better than putting up a warning or swearing in a familyfocused game wouldnt constitute that as a trigger warning though. There seem to be other routes that wouldnt cause backlash against you or your channel. That being said if you feel like you need one or you want one just in case your target audience is someone who might be offended or triggered then by all means put one in.Hope you find this input helpful and good luck with your channel whatever you decide to do!,letsplay,d21fsgt,3,t5_2qss1
7249181,0,t3_4eorxb,As long as they are done right I see no problem with jump cuts. Like others have suggested maybe keep a lot of the deaths in and be careful not to cut out anything important. But if nothing interesting or important happens I see no problem with cutting out ground that has already been tread and the likes. DIf it were me I would just ignore the naysayers and edit the video in the way that I found it to be the most enjoyablewatchable.But if that is something that matters to you or would bother you then I think the two video idea is a fair compromise. Then you can satisfy both crowds although that does make more work for you to do.Cheers mate. D,letsplay,d226i9l,1,t5_2qss1
7249426,0,t3_4ep5e6,Honestly if you ask ten different people about this youll probably get ten different answers. Personally I prefer the convention of Lets Play The Game Title  Episode   Unique Episodic TitleThis varies somewhat from series to series whether or not it is blind etc. Point is I put it in order of the most relevant information to viewers. They care most about what game it is then they care what episode it is and then the unique title is just for flavor.,letsplay,d227ibk,1,t5_2qss1
7250475,0,t3_4epjnb,I tend to be  to  away from the mic and run compression to level my talking. I get it so close with an extendable arm clamped to my desk so it sits in front of my face. Setting it in front of you works just as well though keyboard noise is a bit more audible.In my experience with the  closer is SO MUCH BETTER but the gain settings can be pretty weird. I used to have gain at about  in the systems volume levels but after switching main hard drives ish works like a charm.Test on your setup to see what gain level works with average talking loudness and however loud you might get with the mic fairly close to you and you should be golden.Quick reminder the part of the mic you speak into isnt the tip its the front side that says AudioTechnica. You probably know this already but I didnt for about  months and that was an awkward time.Best of luck!EDIT I dont have the  just the  so no external gain adjuster but the settings should be just about the same since the mics are so similar.,letsplay,d22bsgp,2,t5_2qss1

7630541,0,t1_d39j7ez,Dude. I know exactly exactly what you are talking about. Ultimately its just a struggle to feel appreciated.Its a gamble for every video. Im reluctant to spend so much time editing videos when only  out of  will actually get a decent amount of views.Not to mention its depressing that people are so ready to hate original content on Reddit but praise reposts. Once people actually try to create something they realize the time and effort it takes to create the videos.I guess its a consumer market. People look at things for face value not for the time and effort it takes to create it. I think the thing is over time it pays off.You can bet your ass that people like markiplier and the other big youtubers also spent dozens of hours feeling like their content was being created in vain.

7645337,0,t3_4k0o54,Images and video are displayed as interlaced lines or progressive scan. An interlaced video has been separated into even and odd horizontal lines and then interlaced at a rate of twice the base frame rate. i is actually fps but because the image is essentially cut into halves it comes out fps. Interlaced video looks fine on CRT televisions but it looks absolutely terrible on HDTVs. p is progressive scan at fps. A progressive video will display each frame as its own image resulting in technically superior video. Progressive video will not work on CRTs but will look presentable on HDTVs and monitors. If you choose to use i you might have visual artifacts and a stairstepping effect. Deinterlacing can help improve this for progressive display but it wont be as perfect as recording progressive video from the start.Use p.

7805543,0,t3_4m86sp,gtBut now it feels like wasted time and energyIf youre going to base your motivation on the success or lack of success of others youre in for a bad time. It doesnt end. Dont get me wrong Im grateful for every one of my subscribers but I never reached a point where I was satisfied. Im still not satisfied and thats what keeps driving me to try and make better videos.In other words learn to look at that uphill climb as motivation instead of a burden because no matter how big you get the climb remains an uphill one. Once you start to look at it as a burden you run of risk of just giving up. gtEven things like my equipment. I want to produce high quality videos but for a good pc and other items you need so much money. Similarly dont look at that as a demotivator look at it as a goal. Especially because its something you want to gradually improve. At the end of the day the content is the most important part so it makes sense for your equipment to evolve with the quality of your content.I use filmmaking as an analogy. You can have a cell phone camera or a professional industry camera none of it matters if you dont have a good story to tell first. In our case its better to practice at telling a good story before investing in better gear.gtIt also seems almost impossible to grow for beginners. All the good games are already covered by big youtube channels how can you compete to this?Creativity. Bigger YouTubers might get games early and be first the platform with videos but that doesnt mean theyre always going to be the most creative. Use your creativity to approach those games in unique ways that the bigger channels dont offer and youll hopefully find an audience. I rambled but the key takeaway here is to learn to look at the hardships as a challenge to improve rather than a reason to give up because no matter how much you grow there will still be more challenges ahead. Those never go away they just change.,letsplay,d3tel2z,4,t5_2qss1
7806267,0,t3_4m8pt3,My opinion ofc.While  should be enough to play at fps on max settings mods heavenly rely on GPU memory and in this case you got only gb. Now there are a few mods that are really heavy and even a  drops below  fps.On top of that also you gotta record the content. If you plan on using the same computer to do it you will take a performance hit not much but still.If you cant wait go for it and get a  or a x same price range probably better but when recording  might be better because of shadow play.However If you could wait a bit more then you can get something way beyond a  the new AMD  card by far seems the best option for  you can even get the gb version should be  more and should totally be enough to play way more then fps and head room for heavy mods and recording you can probly even do it in p.On the side of nvidia cant really recommend the new ones because they are way more expensive and for the old ones unless u get a  newused cheaper then  is not worth.If was me I would go the new AMD  released in the end of this month.Hope it helped in someway. ,letsplay,d3thivh,2,t5_2qss1

With me I  dont really think about it and just talk and it usually works out. And in response to the games such as gmod  or rs seige maybe try doing highlights of the games rather than the full ones then at least that way you might not have to worry to much about talking for the entire time.

I was afraid that a lot of people were not enjoying the process as much.Was there any sort of epiphany that came to you after those first few videos or was it more of a practice makes perfect type of progression?Yeah unfortunately the game I want to play Xenoblade Chronicles can have some longer walking periods and with the challenge mode I want to do I might be better off doing some offscreen grinding. On that note when it comes to long not as interesting portions do you prefer to cut them and explain or make a sort of montage either highspeed or otherwiseYeah unfortunately I have to do my final paper of the year and go to a doctor today so I probably wont be starting today. I wasnt actually expecting any responses on this thread for a few hours so I am gratefully impressed.Also if you didnt notice in the game is Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii. It is a  JRPG with a battle system very similar to WOW. And although I am not really a big fan of JRPGs typically because I dont enjoy turnbased or hack n slash fighting styles or WOW they came together amazingly for this game.,letsplay,d43y9j7,2,t5_2qss1

You can be dry as a bone commentary wise and still do better than the funniest person with the worst microphone. A lot of beginners totally skimp on getting a solid mic and it really holds them back. Apart from audio quality Id say talking constantly is super important. The most boring parts of a video need to be the ones with the most interesting commentary if possible cause if your commentary is boring while the game is boring no one will stick around to watch you. Obviously dont talk during cutscenes but apart from that its best to keep up your commentary all the time.,letsplay,d445njc,2,t5_2qss1

7920311,0,t3_4nrfk5,Yes the thumbnails are very specific and youd have to build an audience around that.  Beyond that though looking at your Stardew Valley stuff  minutes for an opening video is a hefty time investment youre asking from people who dont know you.  Somewhere between  and  minutes is usually a bit more appealing at a glance for a first time viewer.Secondly the tags on that same video are a little all over the place.  I know other currently big YouTubers have done very similar things but shady is shady.  Also if Im not mistaken I believe misleading tags is a violation of some TOS with YouTube.  More than that I doubt its helpful to your cause.  Say Im looking at making money on league of legends and for some reason your Stardew Valley LP comes up as a top result.

Im not sure about what you do to the videos I did watch one of them to get an idea but I dont really notice any AE effects in them or none that cant be replicated in Premiere. I use premiere for all my editing needs and just when I need a D virtual space or stage to work with do I use AE.  My point to this is that Premiere renders videos more quickly I Found so you might try redoing your work routine or just see if doing your work in Premiere doesnt help with the rendering times.,letsplay,d4huip8,1,t5_2qss1

8140660,0,t1_d4v3r7i,Hey I really liked your channel. Great work! I have some suggestions that might be helpful to improve your channel even more   Channel Profile Pic  If you are gonna draw yourself dont use an application either draw yourself by hand or take a photo and then photoshop it for better results . Also you can smile or look more positive in the photo and be careful about your background.Your latest video  a. Your voice level is too low and game audio level is too high try to leave a bigger gap inbetween.b. You can use a more energetic outro with optionally info about your social accounts preview of your past gameplays and art about the game you have just played. and please try to remove the photo of yourself at the end dont get me wrong  it is just not useful. It doesnt give the effect of intimacy that you are hoping for it doesnt make the audience feel like you are directly talking to them instead you can talk just before the outro while still in game like most of the LPers do.c. Alwaaaays put subtitles for people to follow more easily and get less distracted.d. Dont talk during cutscenes unless it is ABSOLUTELY necessary. Channel Channel Banner is fine  thumbnails are okey. They will get even better with time. Just check out big LPers you like.SEO You upload around  videos a week  try to make it more frequent. A LP channel tends to be more demanding than for example a make up channel or sketch channel etc.  videos a day or at least  video in  days will work for starters. On your latest video you have only  tags. You have to work on your SEO ASAP! Add these tags for starters  gameplay  walkthrough  playthrough  back to the future gameplay  back to the future walkthrough  back to the future playthrough  lets paly back to the future  back to the future review  back to the future commentary  commentary  review  back to the future reaction  JDoubleU  letsplay ... etc .You got the idea. There are many articles about SEO on net please check them out. Also including gameplay to your video titles wouldnt hurt.Find a catchphrase for starting the video and a different one for ending the video like all major LPers. Some sentence you say all the time in every video like beginningtop of the mornin to ya laddies my name is jacksepticeye and endingThank you guys so much for watching this video. If you liked it PUNCH that like button in the face LIKE A BOSS. And... high fives all around. high fives Thank you guys and I will see all you dudes...IN THE NEXT VIDEOOOO!Consider a facecam it makes the videos more intimate and it makes it easier for the audience to bond with you.Thats all for now.

8273474,0,t3_4sqoj8,Hi there I dont know how much help Ill be but I can tell you what little I know. I know almost nothing about directtv but I do have some level of knowledge on things like the hauppauge Theres also elgato and a few others if you care to research them. Anyway basically Ill just tell you how the capture device works. The hauppauge uses pretty much  vital functions. One is the AC adapter which is required to turn it on since its not a battery user. Two would be the usb cable that attaches to your computer. This will allow whatever the device captures to be sent directly to your computer as nothing can be retained on the actual device. Three and four might as well be together these are going to be the input and the output. As an example Ill give you the most common setup. Basically you will have your console say your ps or xbox or whatever. Now normally you would connect the hdmi Visuals cable essentially cable directly into your tv. However to record the gameplay you must instead hook the console up to your hauppauge input section and then connect a second hdmi to the output section of the capture device and hook that up to the tv. So you would occasionally need two hdmis basically to get the console feed on both your tv and your computer  .Now from what I understand from what I read in your question its not gameplay you wish to record but live tv shows. This is where your knowledge on DirectTV comes in as I know nothing here. Theoretically if you can find a way to make your receiver go directly to the capture device then you should be golden. However one I do not know if such a thing is possible with any form of cable and two you must remember the hauppauge is designed game console recordings so even if you found a way to hook it up there is a chance that the recording program will not even detect anything unless you know how to manipulate tech to such an extent.A question of mine is if this live footage must absolutely come from your directtv can you not simply record something live from your computers internet browser? If you can I would suggest doing so unless you are able to discover some sort of alternative.Honestly this is my first time answering something on this subreddit and Im also a new youtuber so I apologize in advance if I was mistaken on something especially because its so late where I am right now Im tired haha I was busy rendering. Anyway I hope this helped and good luck to you ,letsplay,d5bqrig,1,t5_2qss1

What can I do to make sure that my new viewers watch my other stuff?Be willing to drop it when the hype dies. Find similar games that maybe will pull the surge of new people away from just Tabs.   How can I increase the possibility of having my videos show up in someone elses suggested videos? Similar tags and similar audiences. For example a lot of my subs are matt shea subscribers because of this Youtube likes to always bundle me with Matt if you see Matts name somewhere generally youll see mine as well. And generally similar tagged videos will show up together.  What are the main points that you use to assess whether or not a game will be big? I spend a lot of time looking for upcoming games alphabeta tests prerelease demo etc but...there are so many games coming out! how do you know which games are worth your time and which will die off quickly.Honestly the first thing I look at is will it make a good thumbnail. The first thing people see of a video is a thumbnail and some games are just thumbnail gold. Besiege prime example every thumbnail I do is engaging and interesting and its pretty much the reason why its the most successful series on my channel.

At the start what I did to make myself comfortable is I put a little Vault Boy bobblehead under my facecam that I would look over and talk to so that it felt like I was actually talking to an audience. Even if you are not using facecam just having something to look over to made it easier for me to come up with dialogue that way. Also dont be afraid to mess up at the start.

8655877,0,t3_4yfeju,Ill give the perspective of a larger channel.First things first youre going to have a very hard time getting anyone larger than maybe  subscribers to play your game. Its not your fault or lack of quality in your game its just that we receive so many games that we cant play them all. In addition to that there is no incentive for us to play any game that is actively on kickstarter. Ive had somewhere around  games sent to me in the last month and have only played about  and recorded maybe  of them. Now for your options your best bet is to send out an early email  weeks so we could schedule it in our calendar. To be  honest I couldnt tell you the last time I played a game from a developer that sent me a game without me asking for it first. I keep a rough schedule about  weeks ahead so I can plan and fit the games that I want to play. I request the ones that interest me. I know what my audience will enjoy. gt Also could you offer observationsAddress the YouTuber by name and know the genre of games that the channel plays. You arent going to get a Minecraft of Battlefield channel to touch your game dont waste your time sending it to them. Also dont underestimate the small channels. If you have  channels that each get  views thats the same as  channel getting  views. The little guys are the ones that will likely play your game.gt things you like to see in emails like this?Confidence. Stand behind your game. Use the first email to gauge an interest from the content creators send a follow up as a reminder with the links to the campaigns. Now this is the hardest part  expect no replies. You should have a backup marketing plan that doesnt include YTers and Streamers. ,letsplay,d6nllj4,5,t5_2qss1

9146829,0,t1_d8beysf,I feel like Ive been through the gamut with all the different programs Ive tried so far.  Currently right now I record my oncamera time with the plain ol Windows  Camera app a Logitech C and a AudioTechnica Microphone that I use for my podcast.  The Camera app as barebones as it is lets me choose my audio source and seems to be the best way and the mic does a decent amount of noisecanceling on its own.For gameplay Elgato HD.From there I take the  minute video clips and edit them all together using Pinnacle Studio .I think I spent about a month and a half to two months trying different variations though.  Started using my phone to film that wasnt working out very well so I bought the webcam.  Then tried recording the audio with Audacity and the video with about  different programs before going barebones.So far the Camera app has served me well since it automatically syncs the audio and video except when partway through the video something screws up and it doesnt which happened Friday apparently. I am very much open to new ideas with this process however.,letsplay,d8bfdj6,1,t5_2qss1

For the most part videos of this type tend to be better in tandem with some audio from the player. Without some voice audio to guide the video it just feels like a really fast passed mess. The lack of audio also forces you to rely even more on edits which contributes to the problem of being overwhelming. Judging from the end edit I take it you have watched Red the youtuber  his videos are a pretty good example of what a video of this type should look like. He mixes in audio funny game play and nice edits into a short and sweet video. Keeping in mind that you shouldnt directly copy him try to use his video as a guideline and simply find your spin on it. Although the video wasnt my cup of tea there were a couple really good and creative edits throughout the video that I enjoyed immensely.

Even though the series is about a challenge of gameplay the ten seconds helps remind that there is comedy in the episode. I also try to not use what is the kick of the episode the biggest highlight but a moment that is very memorable. I also try to make sure its a clip that will establish the mood of the entire episode. I dont want it to be a clip that shows success or accomplishment and that be the only moment of success or accomplishment in the entire video.Of course based on the moment and the commentary the ten seconds could be shorter or longer.

The viewers may not entirely appreciate it like I do but they will definitely take notice of the effort. I can usually gauge about how long one of those edits would have taken me to do so I can tell you spent well over  hours on this video.It sucks but a lot of the times most viewers will not make it to the end. Which is when I personally have some really well edited stuff on my footage as well ha ha. Its a pain in the butt but I guess its something we gotta deal with XD.

It sounds so silly but its there. I was so worried about it all. I was worried about how others would perceive me. If they would be able to understand what I was saying well enough.I spent a LOT of time editing my audio because I was so selfconscious about it. I still probably spend more than necessary. Ive found that putting some relatively quiet bed music beneath my audio while I edit it helps me skip over editing out all of the breaths or odd quirks in the audio. So much of it ends up being lost and inaudible anyway!I do most of my audio postgame. Now Im so much more relaxed about it. I just quickly do a retake if I notice I made a mistake. No biggie.

9597693,0,t1_d9vvo0w,Oh boy I love Dark Souls.Im going to be critiquing as I watch so if I say something that is fixed later and I forget to delete it I apologize.Id consider having a piece of gameplay or highlight before your intro reel. Thatll have a much better chance of grabbing the attention of someone who is not already a subscriber.Btw I go to subway every day. You get a coupon when you buy something even when you use a coupon. Its like a vicious cycle.If youre going to have Unedited gameplay with multiple commentators you should edit things into the nothingness. For example around  where youre talking about subway and sponsorships having pictures of subway or small cutaways will help with keeping the audience interested. If you need a physical example older MRKMUSIC and those older Call of Duty trolling videos. Most of the successful ones had subtitles and cartoon faces edited in and it added to the humor. Another example I just thought of is Game Grumps. Barry edits all kinds of gags in their gameplay and it adds a lot of novelty value. Just a thought.  Is she like an Ent? Having a picture of an Ent or if thats a Dark Souls mob having some clip from when you encountered one edited in would be great for those of us who dont know what that is.  Still would be nice with some cut in editing. Like a sub sandwhich with a telescope and submarine windows. Probably a bad example but the point is I think something should go there.   you stand around when youre listening. I know its hard but try to keep progressing.   Lets make it cinematic This was a great chance to add Music add Widescreen Boxes put in a bunch of unnecessary filters death montage. Anything but nothing happens. Its a buildup with no real payoff and a wasted opportunity.BTW Dab or Die.  You have a habit of spinning in circles when you talk to your friends you should try to always be progressing. You should take advantage of the End Screen feature that got released to everyone.That pretty much covers it. It wasnt bad it just lacks real personality.

This style would be used for games I do one shots of that I dont plan on making a series from whereas my actual lets plays will remain similar to how they are now maybe shorter.

But for the most part this isnt the case.If youre super worried about it a lot of games have a FAQ page that will tell you youre allowed to make content with their games. I do know that a lot of people have problem with Nintendo games but for the most part I have never heard of anyone getting in trouble for making LP videos of games. If you are commentating its even less of a risk because youre adding your own personal touch to something.I have had one video out of about  where there was a copyright claim and it was just straight up I couldnt earn money from the video because the composer of the soundtrack claimed itbut the claim later got removed anyway.

That said I still make sure my personal life outside of YouTube comes first unless there is a massive deadline I feel like we really should hit. Since that demotivational period we had a few weeks this month where our growth slowed right down we moved past that and realised why  we have a YouTube channel in the first place. It was because we enjoy gaming together and wanted to share our experiences playing horror games. Now were not treating it so seriously were maintaining our quality keeping to our schedule making friends and having a good time.

10410149,0,t3_5p2075,So I missed partaking in one of these last week because my cohost and I were in the process of adjusting some stuff on our channel. With that being said heres a video from our Super Mario Maker playthrough that Id like some feedback on. For this type of game do you guys feel like itd be more engaging to cut to the interesting or funny parts? Unexpected deaths cool levels etc etc Or is the longplay format fine? My cohost took charge for this series so do we need to change anything up about our dynamic? How was our audiovideo quality? To note I know the audio skips a little bit. Were in the process of building a dedicated recordingstreaming PC thats powerful enough to handle our capture card . And last but not least what can I do to make the videos thumbnail more engaging? I look at it and I just think its kinda bland myself. Mario Maker doesnt really have a cool logo to use unlike Shantae and Overwatch. Should I aim for something different with Mario Maker? Thanks guys. I just want to say that Ive felt a lot more confident in my channel and my videos because of the feedback Ive received here in the past and Ill continue to ask for feedback because we can always improve upon ourselves. ,letsplay,dco23ow,0,t5_2qss1

It wouldnt really make a difference if you uploaded  today and  over the week or  every day. It would likely be better for you to upload  every day and make sure your SEO is strong for those videos so you dont waste content. YouTube gives your videos a slight boost when they get uploaded for a day or two but then they get washed out.If you have a ton that are uploaded today and get a ton of views from them people will expect to see a massive amount of content in short periods of time.Do what you will but I would think its wiser to upload  or  for now and schedule the rest to give yourself some backlog.

It may not work as welllook as professional but its something!Also the reason you would put foam panels behind you is because frequencies bounce of your walls. If you have panels behind you the frequencies that bounce off the wall in front of you will get caught by the panels behind you. Also the square panels are designed for midhigh frequencies so you would also need some things called wedges I believe. Those will soak up low and mid frequencies. They arent too expensice and you can just put them in your corners where most lowmid frequencies get caught in.Thats all I know! Hope it helps ,letsplay,dd3zvjx,1,t5_2qss1

Perhaps you could instead talk about a topic as you always do in your commentary and make it its own video instead of cutting it up sorta like Leafys older videos in .I get that you want to play the story mode of a game but have a lack of topic to talk about sometimes but its fine if its a quiet Lets Play. As of right now Im getting a huge GameGrumpsRoosterTeeth vibe going on here.The type of videos that youre posting are fit for a channel with a huge fanbase for example like SSoHPKCs channel where he spampost a bunch of parts. The only reason why he can get away with doing so is well because he has a solid following already.To gain more attention youd have to do something different. You could include some gameplay where you play with your friends and mess around sorta like UberHaxorNovas. I can imagine some CSGO funny moments with your friends for example something like that do something that concentrates more on the gameplay instead of the commentary with your friend.But hey if youd still wanna stick with the spampost type of upload which admittingly I do it as well haha I guess you could do it when a game is extremely popular like Resident Evil  a while back or for a clearer example FNAF lol I hate this game when it was in its prime months ago.All in all I enjoyed how much you seem to be able to constantly talk about things with your friends not let the mood be silent and being able to keep us entertained one way or another. ,letsplay,ddvvh0p,1,t5_2qss1

10902033,0,t1_de4ez64,I think you bring up some valid points but I also think that you contradict your point a bit.  My original point was that you need to be at least have some proficiency in these areas. Image Manipulation sounds more involved than it usually tends to be If you get to the point where you feel like image manipulation is not very involved then you are proficient.  There was a time where you didnt know how to use any of the tools and Im sure you have increased your artwork since then. I would also like to point out that having good thumbnails is absolutely an essential part of growing your channel because they are the billboard for your videos on the search page. People associate well done thumbnails with quality videos when they are determining which video to click on.  To some degree better thumbnails  more views.  I will also concede the point that some people have artists do their artwork for them so that they dont have to. VideoAudio editing and quality can be streamlined and optimized for fast easy work  Similar to above if you get to the point where you are streamlining your video and audio editing then you have a level of proficiency in these areas.  That being said I would count audio quality and to some degree video quality as one of the most important aspects of your video. If your audio is so bad that it is painful then people will click away.  People are also startling to get away from nonedited videos in favor of highlyedited videos and those channels are starting to suffer a bit more.  I would also caution you from saying this is good enough for either of these aspects and always strive to make them better. Thee are always areas to improve and if you stagnate with your quality then your channel will also start to stagnate. Content and Commentary could be argued as one of the easiest parts I agree that content and commentary can be argued as one of the easiest parts however that does not make them less important. In fact I think a lot of people dont put enough work into their content because they see it as easy.  One of the biggest areas of improvement I see for most channels is pacing and is also what Im working on right now. Public Relations since it would essentially involve not acting like a dumbass for the most part Also true but PR is one aspect that can absolutely shut down your channel or at least make your life miserable.  I would cite the recent drama with Pewdiepie. Im not calling him a dumbass just giving an example as to why it can be important.I do agree that it depends on the person and everyone is going to be better and worse at some of these aspects. I know some people who do amazing video editing and have great quality content but suck at marketing and SEO so nobody sees it. I know people who are amazing at marketing their content and getting eyes on it but their quality is a bit lacking so people dont stick around.  Im not saying you have to master each of these areas but just recognize that they are important and work at making yourself better at each one. Except maybe PR just dont be a dumbass ,letsplay,de4gtw4,2,t5_2qss1

I cant think what would cause this other than a software problem as it sounds as if its going down fairly linear and in some form of frame of time and then resetting. Would be worth checking to make sure that your input device under properties has exclusive rights for third party applications and software to take full control of the input. Audacity may need permission to control your mic.The other thing it could be is your settings in Audacity but I dont see why any DAW would have automatic gain reduction but just check through your recording environment and make sure there is not some obscure setting that you have enabled that is modulating a parameter.

In most cases sending out one key is always going to give you more back odds are they werent going to buy your game anyway you just have to look out for resellers  traders which could devalue your game if numbers are excessive. But yes the benefits to both parties are great  the game gets more exposure and the developer gets some great feedback. The content creator will also reach a new audience and be competing with less other creators for views.If youre interested in making a video on our game then be sure to send me a message with your channel info.

11119570,0,t3_5yk969,My channel is an alien abduction amp Maine history vlog channel that also does Lets Plays in between the vlogs so not a straight up lets play channel and game plays make up only about  or so of the  videos.As a vlogger my topics are various oddball events in Maine such as unsolved murders crime families who live in Maine cryptid sightings interviews with Stephen Kings Thinner Gypsies the real Gypsy clan he modeled the bookmovie after alien abductions various more mundane things I happen to catch on camera walks in local cemeteries etc. Basically any weirdparanormal type thing I can find walking distance from my driveway which in Maine is a lot.As a lets player I do almost exclusively Witcher amp modded Dont Starve challenge runs with a few Otomes and random indie games here and there. I do it as a hobby and not a career so Im way less professional then most other Lets Players no scripts no personas and I dont talk much either basically I just record whatever game Im playing its never planned ahead what Ill play so its sporadic and driven  by what game Im in the mode to play that day. My current focus is a Completionist Blind Run Playthough of the entire Witcher Franchise played in order  got  episodes recorded  currently released and should only take me another  episodes to finish. So itll be almost the only lets plays on my channel for about the next  years LOL!My vlogs are done documentary style and range from  hour to  hours long each video. In spite of the super long length they range in  to  watch time retention with most of my viewers watching at least  hours before stopping.My Lets Plays range from  to  minutes for the little games and  to  hours per video for The Witcher series. Watch time retention is only  on the  to  minute games and only about  of my viewers ever make it to the end of a Witcher episode regardless    of how many views the episode has meaning I have  subs I can rely on to watch my lets plays regardless of how long they are.When it comes to subs likes and views you can see very clearly who most of my subs are. Im at  subs and  views. The one year anniversary since my first video will be in  weeks st video was uploaded on March  .My vlogs average  views one almost every one of them  thats close to my total subs.My Lets Plays average  to  views depending on the gameseries.My most popular videos about  of them all have over  views each with my fastest climbing video Meet The Worlds Most Haunted Car  The Real Christine  Interview With Stephen Kings Thinner Gypsies gaining  of its views in the past  months  even though it was published in May  and only had  view by December . If you are wondering  I changed its tags in January  and it started climbing fast the same week now getting  views per day.  My video to reach the most views in the shortest amount of time was the slideshow The Kidnapped Cats which hit  views in the first  hours a week ago and is still climbing now about to cross ....with a whooping  retention in spite of it being  minutes long. Apparently it was shared over  times which I assume means almost every one of my subs shared it resulting in why it gained so many views so fast in about  hours total.So yeah its easy to see that the bulk of my subs  are following me for my vlogs and interview videos and only about  or so of my subs are following me for my lets plays.,letsplay,dese7pd,1,t5_2qss1

Either way that got about  new subs that provided me with the perfect base to grow from since it nearly skipped the grind from single to triple digits. I cant call it a tactic but what I can say is ask people you know what they think of one of your videos. If they enjoy it you have another viewer.

11399268,0,t3_62l80m,Do not worry about it there are so many factors for dislikes. For example I posted a review of a hardware component earlier. The review itself is done like a review needs to be done its something I learnt. But the first think was a dislike. Why? They probably dont like me my personality my tonality or whatever. Because of the review being completely factbased I know they simply dont like me or my style. Which is fine. But why worry about someone who would never become a subscriber or communitymember anyway? A dislike without comment is something that is unimportant dont worry about it. If its a longtime subscriber who actually says something in the comment then that is another matter entirely ,letsplay,dfo3c6w,1,t5_2qss1

I think youre right that having them look all the same its monotone and you can no longer distinguish the different series. Ill do some experiments on it and then aks reddit for advice.I didnt realize that the music is repetetive but of course when I watch my video after editing it I dont just watch it but I search for things to improve. But after watching it again I see it. I think theres two ways to go. Have a playlist or an even shorter bit that is repeated more muted so its really just a background sound.For the commentary I think youre giving me too much credit.

11422970,0,t3_6326s8,Dude I get this all the time on my Magic Duels videos. I used to do Hearthstone but decided to focus on Magic Duels. I know how much it hurts and is demoralizing to have some dickheads shit all over your video. So many times I wanted to quit. But I kept with it because I love the game and some of my subscribers would comment that they love my gameplay despite the mistakes I make. Eventually I turned all of that into a running joke in my videos. At the very beginning I put a Trigger Warning graphic and joke that Im going to make misplays but fuck you because this is my video and Im playing for fun. Most of the time i win matches despite my mistakes and Ill even comment that I won despite my self sabotage. I also invite the viewers to point out mistakes or better plays in a constructive manner. I straight up tell them shitty comments will get deleted.With all of that everything has improved. I almost never get shitty comments anymore and I get more upvotes than downvotes. Remember downvotes count as interaction with your video so it is still good for you.What kept me pushing through is that I believe that you dont need to be a pro player to enjoy those kinds of card games. The vast majority of the players are not and I like to think im doing something positive by showing that although Im not pro level I can still make videos and have fun with a game I enjoy. My weekly Magic Duels videos have become my number one source of subscribers on my channel. Dont quit bro!,letsplay,dfqs62o,2,t5_2qss1

I enjoyed your reactions to the seemingly random deaths and that epic kickboxing match near the end.  The music in the game is super quiet at times and normal volume at othersbut that may be the games fault cause the voice acting in the game is at a good level.  The video title is slightly confusing. It took me a second to figure out the game you were playing but that may be because I am slow   Overall nice work. I enjoyed the video!,letsplay,dfyob2l,1,t5_2qss1

11724872,0,t3_677sj5,Music is weird. Due to a quirk in copyright law recordings of music essentially never fall into the public domain even if the underlying songs do. In other words you can legally make your own recording of Beethovens th but you cant legally copy a recording of Beethovens th made in  by some nowextinct record label. Theres probably nobody still around to challenge you if you decide to do it anyway but legally the only way for music recordings to enter the public domain is if the creator releases them into the public domain. Most people dont but many people release music recordings under creative commons.However if youre looking for recordings of classical music that actually are public domain look at the US military bands especially the Army and the Air Force. Any media a government employee creates in the course of performing their duties is public domain though Ive found that there are copyright trolls with military band songs in the ContentID system. Ive disputed them and they back off every time but its a hassle.Now not everything the military records it public domain. If the USAF Band records a cover of the Star Wars theme thats still under copyright.,letsplay,dgp1m9d,1,t5_2qss1
