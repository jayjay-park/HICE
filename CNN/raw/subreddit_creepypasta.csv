BIID can be associated with apotemnophilia sexual arousal based on the image of ones self as an amputee. The cause of BIID is unknown. One theory states that the cause of BIID is a neurological failing of the brains inner body mapping function located in the right parietal lobe According to this theory the brain mapping does not incorporate the affected limb in its understanding of the bodys physical form. citation neededgtInteresting Apotemnophilia | Amputation | Body dysmorphic disorder | Acrotomophilia Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchyfl oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechyfl.
