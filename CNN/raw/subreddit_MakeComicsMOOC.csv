11573798,0,t3_64acbp,The provided story idea is cohesive in structure provides a clear beginning middle and end.  YESThe story provides some kind of closure  YESThe story can clearly be told in the span of  panels  comic pages with  panels on each page.   YESThe comic idea provided approaches originality in some respect and is clearly not a plagiarization of another idea.  YESOpen Feedback I like the story the characters and how they convey the moral of the story. For this week only the idea was neccesary. You almost wrote a complete script so you have work for week  almost finished When working in the script for week  keep in mind that the space offered by  panels is quite limited. Try to keep dialogs short and select the  instants that better represent your story.Good job! Cant wait to see week  script ,MakeComicsMOOC,dg7w9nf,2,t5_3byo0
