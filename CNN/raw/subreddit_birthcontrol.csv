101323,0,t3_1v7t76,Im not gonna lie the insertion was not pleasant. I was ok initially besides the shock of having something pushed up into my cervix but on the way home I got the worst cramps of my life and Im on birth control to prevent crippling cramps. I ended up vomiting because my body was in shock but after I popped some tylenol and curled up in bed for a couple of hours the worst of it was over. I was still a little crampy a day or two after but nothing unbearable.I had light periods from June the month after I had it inserted to November and nothing since then. Prior to this I had been on Implanon which I liked better simply because of the ease of it being inserted into my arm. However my gyno said I cant be on that anymore because of my blood disorder that makes me susceptible to clotting. An IUD is the only option apparently.,birthcontrol,cepyt26,1,t5_2snsq

648900,0,t3_21jxut,I had pretty bad cramps on and off for the first couple months. Yes bad enough that I couldnt movehad to curl up in a ball and stop whatever I was doing. I had weird motivation issues and definitely lots of easy crying for about the first three months. It has faded. I still get cryy sometimes but Im pretty sure its connected to my sort of cycle.   My pain even when I get cramps now is really specific. Its not an overall ache in any way. Its very localized and stabby feeling. I imagine because Im cramping on top of this hunk of plastic and yeah its kind of stabby. I wanted an ultrasound but the doctor at student health not my regular doctor didnt think it was necessary and instead felt around my uterus and declared I didnt have any swelling or weird sensitivity so its fine. Im a little cranky she brushed me off about an ultrasound. But my pain has gotten better since then its only really bad when Im cramping due to a period not randomly like before.  I would suggest letting your body adjust some time longer. If its placed correctly most doctors will push for you to try it for at least six months. That would be my suggestion too. Six months should be long enough for your hormones to level out.   Oh and for me I had no sex drive while I was experiencing pain really often. I hurt to much to want sex. But once I quit hurting I was good! I didnt have sex until about  months after insertion so I cant say anything about that. Edit Generally your experience sounds pretty similar to mine. And I am really curious what your doc says about your ultrasound. Especially since I never had one to check my IUD placement.,birthcontrol,cge13bu,1,t5_2snsq
694487,0,t3_21qcbn,I got the implant in October or November and its been nothing but easy for me. I switched off from the NuvaRing. The doctor had me keep the NuvaRing in for a week after Id gotten the implant because I hadnt finished the requisite  days of having it in. After that week I removed the ring and had a period maybe  days later. It came later than it would have had I continued using the Ring normally but it wasnt abnormally heavy and lasted only  days. After that I had no more periods although I would get mild spotting for a day or two after having an orgasm. However that side effect seems to have gone away as well.The truth is that youre going to see horror stories associated with every type of birth control. Lots of women love their IUDs but some get an IUD and experience cramping and periods that are so badlong they need to get it removed. Lots of women have no issues with various birth control pills but then there are some who experience crazy mood swings or completely lose their libido. At least with the implant if I had reacted badly to it I could  take supplementary birth control pills to balance the levels of hormones in my body but without the rigid schedule required of using pills alone or  get it removed quickly with a mild surgical procedure. This is what led me to get the implant over the shot which I would have been stuck with for three months if I didnt react to it well.,birthcontrol,cgj7r87,1,t5_2snsq
705821,0,t3_228tvb,Im not a DR so you should take everything I say with a grain of salt and talk to your DR if you have concerns.Switching from a triphasic to monophasic or vice versa does not effect your protection or so my DR told me. I have switched back and forth a few times while taking my pill continuously to skip periods and have never had an issue.However because you waited for longer than a week it is basically cancels out the fact that you were on other pills. It is like you just started birth control for the first time.If you started your pill during your period you are protected immediately. If you started your pill after that it is possible you are not fully protected as you may have already ovulated but that depends on when you started. You wouldnt be fully protected until after your period when you start the second pack of pills. Personally I would recommend using a back up form of protection because it is only for a month and it is better to be safe than sorry!,birthcontrol,cgki72j,3,t5_2snsq

778353,0,t3_232dk4,Im in a very similar boat. Long term partner neither of us interested in kids but neither ready to become sterilzed.I had been on the pill orthocyclen combo pill for  years when I decided to give Nexplanon the newer version of Implanon a try. I chose the implant because it has a failure rate of .... thats more effective than being sterilized. If inserted and functioning properly it is the absolute best method of birth control on the market right now. For that I love it.However it has its drawbacks. Ive been on it for  months and during the first  months I had periods for  weeks on then  weeks off. This went on until the middle of January. And now I have not stopped bleeding since. My body type might play a major role in how Nexplanon has affected me though. Im very skinny and I dont have much body fat in places other than my boobs and butt. Estrogen which stabilizes uterine lining and is not present in the implant is stored in body fat. At this point that is the assumed problem by my doctor.Dont let that scare you though. I want so badly for the implant to work for me but everyone reacts differently to it. If Im going to bleed for the next  years I dont want it. However if you get it you may very well not have a period for the next  years. You wont really know until you try. Definitely talk to your doctor about what they think would be right for you. I have a good friend who has the IUD Mirena and she loves it. Your doctor might think one fits better for you or heshe will leave it to your discretion. Nonetheless there are my  cents. ,birthcontrol,cgsr48s,1,t5_2snsq

That said we all react differently and just because Mirena has worked for me that doesnt mean itll work for everyone.The main reason I got my Mirena was to sort out my periods and I remember having some nasty heavy cramping the first few weeks to a month after having it fitted.  I was told it could take  months for my body to fully adjust to having it and although the cramps subsided after that first month I just didnt feel myself I was a little irrational and had unpredictable periods for the first  months although these periods were actually just spotting when compared to the usual periods Id had since my early teens.  Everything seemed to suddenly settle down at the  week mark.  Ive had it  months now and I have a very light period every  weeks or so I love my Mirena!My experience was that after the first month the cramps were nowhere near as bad and I could no longer feel the Mirena inside me.

I thought I was just being a typical teenager being all depressed and stuff but Im  now and pretty sure it was all the hormones but I needed them to regulate my periods as they were  days without taking the pill got my first period when I was . They started being  days with the pill but that was still an improvement so I dealt with the side effects. Wanted to kill myself certainly no sex drive bad acne.I got off the pill because I didnt want to be trapped anymore. I had terrible periods and stuff for just over two years but the painful week every month was so worth it for being happy the rest of the time. I was very scared to try Mirena thinking I would be very sensitive to the hormones even though they are localized and I did the math for how much is released every day and how much of that enters the bloodstream. I researched the fuck out of it.Ive had my Mirena since April. I had terrible cramps for about a month and spotted all the way up until the first period I had with it. The spotting and cramps stopped and now I only get cramps the night before my period. Im still getting my period and I hope that one day itll stop buuuut  I love that its nearly the most effective birth control out there and Im not a fucking crazy person! My sex drivedesire is also through the fucking roof. Its a lot higher than when I was without nothing even. I sometimes cry a little easier but if thats the only real side effect Im having I do not care. My acne has also cleared up a little.

1852591,0,t3_2fl2gb,When I first went on pills I think the side effects started up very quickly for me as well. However finding the pill that worked for me took around five months. Some people get the right one on the first try or their bodies arent as sensitive I guess and for some people it takes a few attempts. My doctor made me stay on each kind I tried for two months to let my body attempt to adjust before switching to another. I tried two kinds before finding the pill that worked for me. During those four months I felt absolutely insane and had my period most of the time. Once I did get on the right pill which I still take now six years later the side effects went away quickly. Basically what Im saying is you should give it time and most likely as with any medication your body will adjust. But theres a chance it just isnt the correct pill for you in which case this is going to be a longer process regardless of whether you do it now or later.

2214018,0,t3_2kgxeb,Not sure what the point of taking pills like that is. Its pretty much a total waste of time IMO.  But like the other person said... it totally depends on your personal situation and youd have to see a fertility specialist to know for sure. Its very odd you dont really get a period at all considering how infrequently you take the pill. Have you actually taken any pregnancy tests lately? If I took pills like that Id be having  week long periods and probably skipping some periods and everything would just go to hell in regards to menstrual cycle regularity but everyone is different! There isnt much point to worry about it until you are planning to have a baby. But honestly if youre going to take pills like that I would either stop altogether or get an IUD. Youre screwing with your hormones majorly! Its not like its going to damage your body I dont think Im not a doctor though but your body is probably like wtf dude haha.,birthcontrol,cll96uq,8,t5_2snsq

2288936,0,t3_2lft7a,Im  with no kids. Paragard can possibly take me thru menopause!  I was either the pill or Prozac for years and I want to get away from hormones and just be me.  It all happened kind of fast because i had my annual check up the Monday before and was on the last  days of my pill pack. I inquired about the esure permanent birth control but they haven had enough requests for it to get into it. Paragard was suggested instead. I came home discussed it with my fiancee and scheduled my appointment for this past Monday after work. I took mg ibuprofen an hour beforehand. I didnt get any numbing or cervical softening medication tho.  Ive been seeing my nurse practitioner Melanie for a long long time. I trust her and thats what calmed me down. I was nervous but not too bad.  Im rather tough about pain so I knew I could handle it even if it was bad.  I didnt have anyone with me and drove myself home.Melanie asked for the rounded clamp that holds the uterus so that part didnt hurt at all. She put a probe thru my cervix and warned me that it would cramp. Is that the measuring part everyone is talking about? It felt like a sharp cramp for only a second and was done.  After a couple minutes she put the applicator tube thru my cervix and it was the same cramp but not as bad.  Then she loaded the paragard and in it went!  I could feel the little arms unfold which was an unusual sensation but honestly thats the last cramp I have had.  Bleeding has stopped as of yesterday and I feel great!   I saw on another thread that a few couples have named their IUD. Lol. We are leaning toward Dread Pirate Roberts.  Goodnight sperm. Ill most likely kill you in the morning. Glad you had a positive experience OPTo anyone considering paragard or other IUD I strongly suggest you not read a bunch of horror stories.  Most people have experiences like ours unpleasant but not painful but its rare to hear form those people.  Stay calm and get an IUD! ,birthcontrol,clumncp,2,t5_2snsq

I got Paragard which has no hormones and other than some discomfort in the beginning its been awesome. My periods are more regular than they have ever been hardly any crampingThough I will admit the cramps are a bit worse if they happen at all almost no acnewhich is a major plus I used to have really bad acne on pills and I do not have hormone related mood swings at all. I may get grumpy around my period but its more to do with feeling like a beached whale and body issues. Also Planned parenthood covered nearly all of the cost. I paid about  for it to be inserted and it could last me  years. While there is an advised expiration I was told that the nature of the materials allows them to last longer. However I am not a medical professional dont take my word for it. I just love that I essentially prepaid ten bucks a year for birth control and I dont have to go through the side effects.

At first sex drive wasnt a problem but in the last  months Ive completely lost interest in sex which sucks.

2829402,0,t3_2sgfar,The period you get on combined oral contraceptives is only a withdrawal bleed  caused by the dip in hormones as they decrease due to stopping them for a week. Some preparations may not have a high enough level of oestrogen or in your case the progestin is too potent. This pill table will show you which pills will be better if youd prefer to have a bleed.  It isnt necessary to bleed on your breaks and wont harm you.Cerazette and other progestin only pills have the advantage of sometimes stopping periods altogether there are no pill free breaks either but not always. ,birthcontrol,cnpp4y3,1,t5_2snsq

Theyll use sterile gloves too. Also keep in mind that if an infection should occur theyre pretty easy to treat for the most part. Unpleasant but not lifethreatening.Falling out is also rare but if it happens you can always have another inserted or explore alternative methods.Complications are rare and most women find they are satisfied with their choice. But I totally get psyching yourself out and not wanting to deal with more bad side effects. Its not impossible that youll face them just highly unlikely.

I had to wear a tight bandage around my arm and the next day I was able to take it off and just wear a small normal bandage. I think it took around  weeks to fully heal to the point where it couldnt get infected. I had HORRIBLE bruising purple and black and blue that took a month or so to go away. It wasnt that big of a deal though. Now I only have a small dot scar where it was inserted. . My gyno warned me that my periods would be messed up and would eventually go away. For the first few months I did not have any periods. Recently I started bleeding for around  weeks then stopped bleeding for  days and now Im bleeding again. Its kind of annoying but Im okay with it because my gyno said it will eventually stop. The bleeding is really light and it doesnt really feel like Im on my period because I dont get cramps or anything. My friend who has been on Nexplanon for a year said that within  months of having it inserted the unpredictable bleeding completely stopped. .

3810017,0,t3_341rnv,Hey eitheroreither!I debated the same think for several months before finally making my decision and going with Nexplanon implant and honestly I am thrilled I did.Youre correct in saying that DepoProvera shot can cause osteoporosis if used for an extended amount of time. The recommended usage for the shot is I believe two years. Hearing that you dont want children for many years down the road makes me believe that the implant would be very good for you.Since getting the implant the only side effects I have experienced are headaches from time to time and mood swings that are more... obvious near my period. My boyfriend just loves that one. Hahaha. As far as your concern with breaking I havent heard many instances of that happening. The region where the implant is located would be very difficult to break unless you do it intentionally. Youd really have to mess with it to break it. I dont think it is a major concern but it is good you are taking that into consideration.Overall the implant is awesome for women who dont want children any time soon and those who suck at taking pills like myself. The pain is very minimal and the fact you dont have to do it again for another three years is fantastic. Also if you ever had any negative side effects with the shot you would have to wait until it wears off three months later. With the implant if you find it doesnt work for you you can get it removed and youre good to go!Hope this helped!,birthcontrol,cqqkm3y,8,t5_2snsq

3868817,0,t3_34feyt,My own few months of experience! YMMV. My periods were pretty light to start with and would only last around  days  the first one on the copper IUD was a bit heavier and significantly more painful but a different kind of pain than usual  more specifically located and stabby than crampy? Since then though the pain levels went back to normal flow is still a little heavier but I dont really notice a difference. Im guessing anemia relates to how much blood you lose and again I guess that this really just depends on your individual flow. I started antidepressants relatively close to the time I had the IUD fitted so I cant really say what causes what Im afraid! I feel like I do get a bit more PMSy now mostly irritablecarb and sugar cravings for a couple of days rather than all the emotions. Overall I have gained a couple of pounds. That said weight gain is a common side affect of antidepressants so Im not sure I can really pin this on the IUD! I used to experience your basic bloating fatiguefeeling a bit cloudy and crying at any adverts with sad looking animals in nearing the end of my pill pack when on the combined pill. That stopped when I came off hormonal BC and hasnt reemerged with IUD insertion.  My sex drive also dropped on the combined pill came up when I went to condoms only seems pretty much the same now but again my other meds would be the probable cause of any drop. Fingers crossed no! I suffered this after an illfated attempt at moving to the single hormone pill the same dose as the mirena I think? Body did not like. Can definitely sympathise its a horrible thing to deal with but it did seem to resolve itself eventually once I quit hormonal birth control along with the oncefrequent thrush infections fun My boyfriend is relatively... long by my limited experience at least and we have had a couple of incidents  once where he was poked by the wire and shot across the room like a scared cat cervixbumpingtype discomfort on my part for the rest.

4359783,0,t3_3aveel,taking three pills in one day did not protect you  instead you should have followed your pamphlets directions on starting birth control for the first time. your pill requires that you use back up protection for the first  days of active pills so you were not protected. you also are not protected this week because you did not take  active pill every day for  days and will not be protected again until the th day of your next pack the first  days you will need to use back up protection.copied directly from your pamphletIf you MISS  white active pills in a row in Week  or Week  of your pack. Take  pills on the day you remember and  pills the next day.. Then take  pill a day until you finish the pack.. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the  days after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method such as a condom or spermicide as a backup method for  days.If you MISS  OR MORE white active pills in a row during the first  weeksIf you are a Day  StarterTHROW OUT the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day.If you are a Sunday StarterKeep taking  pill every day until Sunday. On Sunday THROW OUT the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day.. You may not have your period this month but this is expected. However if you miss your period  months in a row call your healthcare professional because you might be pregnant.. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the  days after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method such as a condom or spermicide as a backup method for  days. so yes you could be pregnant. i recommend taking a pregnancy test  days after the second time you had sex and then again  week later to confirm the results.,birthcontrol,csh2xcc,1,t5_2snsq

Gained a minor amount of weight as far as I could tell it all went to her boobs in reality probably  went to boobs so she is eating a little healthier now to be careful but we are both happy who doesnt love boobs? For many months her periods stopped. Now they happen every now and then but are super short and light. She also didnt lose an ounce of horniness. Feels like her libido went up granted we hadnt been having sex much before she got the implant and now we feel like we have an amazing sex life which is made much easier by the implant.

Experiencing weight gain isnt actually a common side effect and its not as though any form of birth control can actually make you gain weight without changing your exercisediet habits.

Copper iud in place got it July  sharp pain in lower right belly and in addition to that spotting and after a few doctors visits and eventually the emergency room confirmed that I was pregnant and that the pregnancy was ectopic.In regards to the ultrasound I was very much indeed pregnant at the time I had my ultrasound but there was no evidence of it there as it was very early on so that may be something to keep in mind. ,birthcontrol,cwfnba6,2,t5_2snsq

But your womb is probably very thin due to the recent bleeding and the many years on depo. I have endo. Never tried Mirena but did have a regular IUD prediagnosis and I know what you went through!!! You might have some adenomyosis too as I do cant be fully diagnosed without a hysterectomy though which will make anything involving your cervix absolutely excruciating.

I use the phone app Clue to track my cycles. I love it but using an app alone cannot totally accurately predict your fertile times. FAM works on a combination of symptoms such as cervical position mucus and temperature. The bible of FAM is a book called Taking Charge of Your Fertility its really great and will teach you how to work out your safenonsafe times in order to avoid conception. Obviously its written presuming your only method of BC is FAM but in your case you could use it to abstain from sex during fertile times and use condoms and contra gel during nonfertile times. I dont think having an irregular cycle is too much of an issue as long as you are using actual symptoms to indicate fertility and not just working on day numbers some people with regular cycles can just plan to abstain from day  to day  of their cycle or whatever.

After removing it for your period week you should typically get your period within  days. My periods lasted only about  days while on it. I did gain about lbs but it mightve also been my very unhealthy eating habits at the time because within a few months I was able to lose the gained weight.

Some women bleed the entire three years some start to bleed in the last  months of year three some spot constantly some never bleed at all  as you know.  Everyone says to wait  months or  months etc but you never know when you will stop or start bleeding with it. Id give it a few months to see if it evens out at all and you normalize but you know your body and what you want better than anyone. If its not your thing its not your thing. It may also be an option to the pill for regulation. And as a side note... blood isnt that big of a deal really. Not much different than cum sweat saliva etc just colored red. A condom and a black towel folded in half keeps the party pretty clean enjoy a nice shower afterward when youd be cleaning up anyways. What youre having shouldnt really be any substantial kind of bleeding over a long period of time. If it is substantial requires more than a panty liner then you might consider going in to see your OB after another  weeks or so. You should be experiencing something more like light spotting with possible heavier flow on occasion once every couple of weeks once a month etc. With the light spotting sex can sometimes even make it better!

Taught me breathing exercises for the insertion they warning before doing anything and most importantly they moved as fast as they could so I wouldnt be in too much pain. Honestly it was a world of pain but put simply it was like really bad cramps. I tried the pill and the Nuva Ring before hand. I could never remember the pill and the Nuva Ring made me outrageously depressed. The first day with it there is some cramping and you feel a bit violated but it passes quickly. I did cramp and spot for maybe  or  months after having it placed but thats to be expected. The only side effect I had from my first iud was a little cramping if your backed up or during sex. Nothing crazy though. On a brighter note my mood swings were gone my body acne was gone my periods were gone my weight didnt increase. It was one of the best choices Ive ever made. I do feel obligated to tell you that my current IUD is awful. My five years was up with my first one so in December I had a new one in. It was so much more painful. The cramps for the first two days had me in tears it was the most pain Id ever been in. I couldnt walk. Im dealing with some pain now but I also have some appointments lined up. I dont want that to discourage you at all I have some pain but i am still fully protected from pregancy.

I dont know that I ever really talked to my doctor about it but I decided it happened because I had a lot more discharge than normal for the first few months I guess it was just my vagina not adjusting yet to having something in it all the time and that lead to yeast infections they werent constant or anything just recurred much more frequently than I usually experience which is rarely. IIRC it only lasted for  months then my body adjusted but it always seems to take a week or two to completely knock out a yeast infection Ive never gotten a script for it I always get the day OTC treatment.Hopefully it gets better for you soon! ,birthcontrol,dagimn8,2,t5_2snsq

9868297,0,t3_5gokz0,Hi I got mine at  so a little more than a year ago. Id wanted it for months and Im so glad I got it I love it. My boyfriend drove me and the appointment took about  minutes. My doctor said hello and set me up in the stirrups cleaned my cervix which feels super weird but doesnt really hurt measured my cervical depth which hurt and then inserted it which hurt very badly lol. She counted down from  I think? while the arms of the IUD opened and then it was in. The pain was gone within a minute and I was able to walk to the car right afterwards painfree.Editing to add that after about  minutes the cramps set in and they sucked but were bearable.For me my biggest problem was not being able to sleep because of the cramps. Id been on pills for years and hadnt had cramps since I was  so I was really uncomfortable. The only thing I would do differently next time is get something to help me fall asleep because the pain kept me awake. Two days later I was mostly pain free with the occasional poking sensation internally that I still get from time to time.I dont really get a period anymore just come spotting here and there. I do get cramps though now pretty often and out of the blue even when Im nowhere near my spotting days.I havent noticed much of a difference with sex but sometimes it hurts a little when my boyfriend goes too deep hes on the larger side. I was really scared that hed be able to feel the string but hes never complained. I think I had sex less than a week after insertion but I dont remember exactly. If its too painful just be patient and try again a different day.Good luck tomorrow. I really love my IUD and encourage everyone I know to get one. Try not to stress too much just remember that years of protection is worth a couple days of cramps ,birthcontrol,datv1dp,4,t5_2snsq

You could either try Mirena progestin only but you might have spotting with that as well since no estrogen. You might like NuvaRing.

10558483,0,t1_dd4w6s2,Sure! I do want to preface it that I just had my first Paragard inserted in September and only had it a few months before it started to expel a couple of weeks ago. Since I had it so short a time my cycle had just started to normalize so someone who has had it longer may have had more time to acclimate to it. But I liked it enough to give it a second chance so...Overall I have had a positive experience with my Paragard thus far. I selected it because I wanted to make the switch to the reliable and easy IUD from other birth control and honestly just kinda wanted a break from bc after  years on various hormonal birth controls. The Paragard is also good for  years which is hard to compete with. Excluding all the advantages that all IUDs share just inherent to the fact they are IUDsAdvantages Lasts  years which is so nice Nonhormonal  no common side effects from hormones like weight gain mood changes etc. Can be used as an emergency contraceptive Works immediately and alternatively you can start trying to get pregnant as soon as its removedDisadvantages Can make periods longerheaviermore painful the first  months where hormonal IUDs frequently stop monthly periods No hormones  none of the positives like effect on acne etc.This was my experience so there may be a few other points that I didnt personally experience that Im forgetting. I did have noticeably more painful cramps the first few days of my cycle but like I said earlier it had begun to normalize and it wasnt bothering me by the time it expelled. The cramping I had wasnt enough to deter me from trying again and I was happy to know I was protected from pregnancy but didnt need to stress about hormones. If youre due for a new IUD and are interested why not give it a shot.

10788865,0,t3_5ubhxg,It sounds like getting off the pill has triggered this. I wouldnt necessary blame the IUD for it. Sometimes hormones are thrown off if you get off a hormonal birth control. It can take a few months to a year to settle down.,birthcontrol,ddssmbu,5,t5_2snsq

10828827,0,t1_ddwqt65,Can you find your cervix? I have a hard time finding my strings if Im just looking for them but I can usually find my cervix and then feel them coming out. The best way Ive found to feel it is standing up in the shower with one leg on the side of the tub. The cervix moves around in your cycle so it could be hanging out really anywhere  mine likes to hang out closer to the wall facing my stomach recently Ive found it off to the left. Just kind of explore and try to feel along each wall until you find something that feels like the tip of your nose and kind of like a donut sounds weird but surprisingly accurate haha. Your strings should be coming out of it and you shouldnt be able to feel any hard plastic that would mean its coming out. Depending on how close you are to your boyfriend you could ask him to feel around too since his fingers are presumably longer than yours and the cervix can be pretty high up depending on where you are in your cycle. Honestly though even if you can feel them you might want to go to your doctor if its causing you so much discomfort just to make sure everythings okay. ,birthcontrol,ddwx0wa,3,t5_2snsq
10838856,0,t1_ddxwle7,Thanks Im using condoms now for bc and I feel much better most of the time. Have you been tested for H. pylori or had any gallbladder tests done? Problems with those things have similar gastric symptoms. Also if you take proton pump inhibitors like Prilosec for an extended period you might need to taper off of the pills or risk getting more heartburn when you stop taking them. Your doctor should be able to help you with that. If they cant consider getting a second opinion. EDIT I should reiterate that I dont think the IUD caused my stomach issues. I fully believe it was the medicine and a light diet that helped me recover and not my body adjusting to hormones. I do think other side effects from my IUD worsened my GI symptoms though and wish I had taken it out sooner. In my opinion theres no reason for you to suffer through hormonal side effects at the same time youre dealing with medical issues.,birthcontrol,ddxy922,1,t5_2snsq

They were super respectful of my wishes to get a nonhormonal IUD and not pushy at all. Of course I can only speak to my local clinic but PP is fabulous.For what its worth Ive had good experiences with IUDs and Ive had both types now. I thought briefly about the arm implant but liked that the IUD is more longterm mine is good til  and was worried I would be one of those people with constant spotting.

11256575,0,t1_df7faht,Are you taking a monophasic or a triphasic? Also since withdrawal bleeds are unnecessary and are so horrible for you you can just skip them altogether by going from active pills straight to a new pack and not taking the placebos. This works best with monophasic pills though and usually people need to take at least one placebo week every few months or they have breakthrough bleeding.

11670573,0,t3_66iib1,.For more experiences check out rchildfree and rsterilization. I will put my experience after a few points. .You mention cost? Do you have insurance? If so likely both are  covered by your insurance caveat If not grandfathered and the ACA birth control requirements apply remember it applies to employer plans as well. See www.coverher.org Also your insurance booklet  plan info should list it as covered. You can usually find it online and search it easily. Only thing usually not covered is total tube removal bilateral salpingectomy which is considered cancer prevention not sterilization per the FDA  federal government regulations. I would schedule whatever you chose this year since the ACA regulations are in limbo and may change in the next few years. .A TL isnt invasive. Or I wouldnt call it invasive. Surgery itself was  minutes. I left the hospital after around  hours  day at home recovery. This might depend on which TYPE of tubal ligation you go for. Currently Filshie Clips are becoming the default method for most TLs. Which is what I got. Caveat I use most but of course your doctor may prefer another method. .Essure insertion can be problematic. I believe last I looked it had around a  failure to insert  placement on the first try. I could be wrong since I havent researched this recently and I think different studies have different s  might be range  depending which you look up. Now this is just one Essure story  But my real life friend had a bad Essure placement  it misfired so she had to be scheduled for a more time consuming TL to remove the misfired spring  It was fine and noninvasive in the end just a little bit more time to make sure there wasnt any pieces of springs left. I had already decide on Filshie Clips but that solidified my decision even more. Im not saying it isnt a great method. Just wanted to point that out. And it is a small . .Ok so my TL experience ...I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. It has the best effective rate I could find lifetime average effective rate of . see  or So I scheduled an appointment with my OBGYN she is on the younger side and very openminded there is a link in the sidebar to open minded doctors if you dont have a open minded OBGYN. We had a  minute conversation and she agreed that I was well researched  she was comfortable I understood it was permanent. After the consult I discussed with her scheduling nurse when I would prefer to schedule it it was around  months out. Cost During my research I triple checked the ACA law required the insurance to  cover it. I paid about  for the at home pain pills. So in total it cost me only .! PreOpSince it was scheduled  months after the consult the hospital required my doctor to do a PreOp with me. So week of procedure I had a PreOp apt with my Doctor. Basically just a quick check of everything. I asked whether I needed a catheter and she doubted I would. She gave no restrictions as to sex or exercise and just resume when comfortable. Got my pain prescriptions and prefilled them so I could go straight home after my tubal ligation. Definitely ask to get them prefilled. Procedure It was scheduled for  am on Friday. Hospital told me to check in at  am for paperwork  prep. Paperwork was just double checking everything copy of insurance card  etc. Walked to a private mini hospital room and Nurse started intake  asking health questions when did I eat last what medications etc and changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. Doctor also stopped by to chat before. I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. Then one of the nurses gave me an IV they numb the area first. I peed right before so I wouldnt need a catheter and I didnt. The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots this is normal for any procedure. Around  am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. Later I was then rolled into the OR. I dont even really remember leaving the room  they have some good drugs PostOPI woke up wide awake in the recovery area. The patch worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a . It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling but no real pain per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took  minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button but because she was so awesome no scar there. The second small incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. After  minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After  minutes of being in the big recovery area I got dressed by myself and left. We left around  am. Tips Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. AtHome RecoveryFriday I went home and slept. I could walk around fine I was just tired. I walked up the stairs to my bedroom by myself. My tummy was a tiny bit inflated by the gas they use to see what they are doing in there but nothing crazy it just looked like I had eaten a big meal  slight bloat. The pain pills made more tired so I just slept the rest of the day. I late lunch and dinner normally. Saturday and Sunday The rest of the weekend I just watched TV with my husband. I could do stuff I just chose to relax. Basically it was just a lazy weekend. Have some good movies and shows to watch. I was sore but just like too many situps sore. I could have done errands if I needed to but with the pain pills you arent suppose to drive.MondayI went back to work on Monday. No prescription pain pills and just did over the counter stuff Monday and Tuesday. No one even guessed anything  The worst thing was really from the IV big bruise as my veins hate IVs but just wore long sleeve shirts for a few days. Tips Heating pad for tummy and Popsicles for your throat. Summary It was way simpler and easier than I thought! I have one tiny  inch scar below my bikini line that faded. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! Let me know if you have any random questions  and feel free to PM in the future or anything. ,birthcontrol,dgivip6,5,t5_2snsq
