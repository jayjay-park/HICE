262037,1,t3_1x35yr,I am a biology major and bio med grad student. I have taken several ichthyology courses and done a shit load of research on fish in the lab as well as in the field. Edit said these were two distinct fish but doing some research on it now because now I am only pretty sure these are two different fish.for those that asked northern largemouth usually have  lateral scales and the florida largemouth usually has . From what I could tell from the clearest picture the number is closest to the northern but I would need to count the scales by hand to be sure. Also  and  respectively for the scales around the caudal peduncle. It could still be an intergraded population as they say which means it could still have a little florida thrown in there. Edit  After hours of reading and being distracted by this It turns out that stocks of fish have been found to have identical arrangements of chromatophores the finding is on page . Fuck Im just trying to figure this out I didnt expect upvotes but I didnt expect downvotes either. ,bassfishing,cf7x3jn,-2,t5_2quue

Fishing from shore isnt a bad way to start but a boat will make things a lot easier because you can get to the spots where the fish are. As for weight and length you need to check your local fish and game regulations on what is a defined as a bass you can keep. If youre gonna fish catch amp release then size doesnt really matter. As for fishing guides this sub is always a great place to start also theres   which is sometimes very technical but has some beginner guides and lastly join a local bass fishing forum.

Just started using it the past couple of days and Im liking it. The lighter weight jig plus the big plastic trailer helps to slow the fall rate a bit which I really like in the spring.Rodreelline is a Daiwa Fuego with  lb Seaguar Red Label flouro on a Daiwa Ballistic XH   rod. Some people dont like filling in all of these details but I think everyone should share them. Showing fish is nice but telling people the setup is awesome. The rod is definitely overkill for a jig rod Im going to use it for frogs and swimbaits when the water warms up enough for it live in Southern NH.

1303091,0,t3_28v623,This will be more frustrating to learn on than a newer reel and if its that old theres a good chance the drag is not going to work right. Even a cheap reel today will have better cast controls and will be waayyy more comfortable though longevity on those cheap ones is questionable. If the drag on this reel works it could end up being great for chucking heavier baits or live bait. It does have some kind of friction cast control the small black knob on the handle side of the reel so you could definitely give it a try. Just make sure the drag works. The downside to full size casting reels is they are just bulky and uncomfortable especially if youre fishing baits thay require a lot of movement like jerkbaits.

2995256,0,t3_2udvgb,Especially for smallmouth a jerkbait is an awesome way to find active fish fast and a drop shot can pick apart a school quick active or not.  So these are both good approaches when each fish counts and in lakes where the quantity of smallmouth outweighs the quality of largemouth by far.  So youre going to have power fisherman like KVD throwing jerkbaits or spinnerbaits and finesse guys like Aaron Martens using a drop shot or weightless Senko etc.  It would be a little different if it was a best  tournament or if there were more largemouth in these lakes.  Then youd see more of the shallow cover fishing which Id also like to see.    I think the CA Delta would be an AWESOME place to see them do a season!  Size could easily beat out numbers on a place like that.  But no matter where it is I love watching these tournaments its such a cool format.

I used to go to North Central and other lakes around the Chisago area but skipped it last year since people were saying the winterkill was bad. Otherwise for this years opener I tried Virginia right underneath Minnetonka but was just okay and the cold morning didnt help.I usually go to smaller or at least less popular lakes because Im only on canoe.

3963283,0,t3_35uvld,Faster presentations  you dont have time to slowly work a tx rig or a jig.  My go to on a river is a weightless fluke tx rigged its weedless can be worked topwater or if you have time pause and let it get down deeper.Next is a shallow running crankbait depending on whether you have weeds or not.  I throw a Rapala Shad Rap  SR model runs about  ft deep.  If its a weedy river and theres largemouths dont discount a hollow body frog thrown against the banks but this will require a heavy action rod which is kind of a unique application you probably want to stick to the flexibility of M and MH rods maybe even spinnign rods.If the river is slow enough go ahead with tx rig soft plastics or small craw jigs just throw them tight to cover and dont plan on taking much time retrieving them.Also small spinner baits and small buzz baits.  Good for fast retrieves shallowmoving water adn theyre weedless.,bassfishing,cr81q7s,3,t5_2quue

4084882,0,t3_37drvs,Well it has a low gear ratio so I personally would use it for crankbaits it would allow them to get to their maximum depth. A medium moderate action rod would work well. And I always recommend flurocarbon line as its my favorite. However there is no be all end all rodratio requirement. Its all what you prefer. If you want to fish with soft plastics then thats just fine. However you would want a heavier rod for it. So basically you have to know what you will be fishing with then you can narrow it down to which rod you would like. ,bassfishing,crlwhfg,1,t5_2quue

4830250,0,t1_cu35yxi,gt Dont tell me a rod that is x the price will catch x the fishYou cant think that way nor does it make sense.  My friend fishes expensive gear like  on one rig.  And let me tell you what they are awesome.  They are remarkably sensitive powerful well balanced and smooth. Does he catch more fish than I do? Nope Ive out fished him before.  Buying expensive gear is a marginal gain.  Dont expect to catch every fish you see but you will catch a few more just because the quality is better. How many more fish would you catch if you could feel more of your bait? How many more fish could land with a strongcontrolling reel? How many more fish if you rodreel allows you to cast better?   I bet youll catch a few more.I dont recommend expensive gear to anyone that doesnt already have it because most people dont need it.  The majority of people that fish dont know how dont fish often or care really about catching big fish. ,bassfishing,cu3e5m9,2,t5_2quue

I cancelled after I got the box because I wasnt impressed with it at all. Mostly hooks and weights attractant and some hand wipes.With MTB I had it for about  months. First three months I had for bass then switched it to ice fishing which got me out of the house more this last winter. Then in the spring they started doing the panfish boxes which I switched to and started building up my now  year old sons tackle box.  LTB I only had for about  months and I really liked them. I signed up for them once I switched my MTB over to the panfish box. Both companies had great baits both hard and soft and great customer service.

8612043,0,t1_d6hzrvx,No not really. If Im fishing a drop shot from the bank I lengthen the leader because of the angle of the line that will be created when making a long cast from the bank... I want to keep that bait about a foot off the bottom.I also drag a drop shot when Im on the bank a lot more than I do on a boat. I just keep the line tight and slowly reel in making sure the weight never really comes up off the bottom. I reel it at like a snail pace. When Im on a boat I generally fish it vertically  of the time. Either I drop it down right off the side of the boat or I pitch it a few feet out from the boat. Ill find the fish with the electronics and then target them with the drop shot. They call it videogame fishing and theyre not kidding.Either way if you do the things I mentioned and fish the right bait youre going to catch fish on it. Its kind of a donothing setup. Just fish a natural colored bait like one of the ones I mentioned and start casting. If you find some structure weed edges or anything like that... throw it in there and go. Its not the most excited technique in fact its almost like watching paint dry when youre searching for the fish but it will get bites when nothing else works. Especially if youre on a highly pressured public body of water and the fish are relating to the bottom and not feeding until after dark... a drop shot is one way to get them to bite. Youre putting a subtle small profile bait right in front of their face. To them its a free meal. Until its not.,bassfishing,d6i3os1,3,t5_2quue

Most people go with baitcasters myself included for the accuracy and speed of casting but that reel should be able to handle  braid and getting a fish out of the muck.If you wanted to do the frogging thing you should pair it with a  MHH rod. Ive never bought a spinning rod of that power so I dont have any particular brands to recommend.The problem youre going to have if you want it for lighter applications is the sheer amount of line that thing will hold potentially wasting a lot unless you have a ton of cheap mono backing. Large spinning reels also weigh quite a bit so that will get tiresome.

11573586,0,t1_dg74sqf,The only way I use a senko is weightless.
