4326478,0,t3_3ajxlp,Welcome uAWildWurmple! Ill try to answer your questions. gt  Has Alduins attack on Helgen happened?Yes. This story mentions the attack on Helgen and I think our general rule of thumb here is that if you wrote that it happened it happened.gt Continuing on that if it has happened what part of the Main Quest is the Dragonborn on?No one has mentioned the Dragonborn yet in their stories. All I know is that dragons are flying around. Ingame this would mean that the Dragonborn has finished Dragon Rising i.e. the first dragon fight at the Western Watchtower after Bleakfalls Barrow. Does the Dragonborn know how to shout yet? If you write that she does then it is so.gt Have the dragons happened?Yes dragons are here and can be killed. You can use their bones and scales for crafting but you cant absorb their soul incharacter.gt Do I need to play along in game and have screenshots to post?Nope thats not necessary. If youre looking to get into this Ive posted some suggestions on how to make and upload screenshots in this thread.gt  Is this in Skyrim or anywhere in Tamriel? Also what year?You dont need to restrict yourself to Skyrim. Weve had several stories that mention events outside of this one province. This story mentions dates and other stories are probably taking place during the same timeframe. I dont think you need to worry too much about dates unless you want to keep a really detailed journal. If that is what youre looking for Id advise you read the Zorah stories because thats the only storyline that puts dates to events.Dont worry too much. If your story conflicts with some other story we wont chop your head off. Instead we might politely suggest the use of the edit button. Now go write that story!EDIT Dont worry about time. If you want to start your story as villager in Helgen thats fine. We all know Helgen will get burned down eventually but you can use that for dramatic effect like starting a story on the Titanic. Also weve got two stories that both have Teldryn Sero as a follower. Hes a sellsword from the Dragonborn DLC so he gets hired all the time. As far as Im concerned this doesnt cause conflict it just means these two stories are happening a few months apart.,RoleplayTES,csdbn10,2,t5_386s0
