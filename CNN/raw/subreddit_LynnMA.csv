4870056,0,t1_cu886h2,I dont know any of those places. I do not live in Lynn just worked downtown for over  years. I went to have a beer at the half Chinese place  half bar on Union street across from the walgreens just to see what kind of place it was. It was exactly what I thought. I guess I didnt drink anywhere in Lynn for fear of seeing someone I worked with  coworker or client. ,LynnMA,cu8eouj,1,t5_32xbb
