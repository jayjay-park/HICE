2746235,0,t3_2riecu,The  thing is to make Jays the best place to go for Sports in Fredericksburg.  Right now there are only a few sports bars in the area so simply making sure that if people want to watch a game the first thing they think of is Jays.  Pay attention to what games people want to see and make sure the  TVs are tuned to the most popular games but also give a good amount of diversity.  Someone may come in and appreciate that the George Mason v. George Washington or whatever basketball game is on instead of every TV showing the same thing.  Once NFL and college football are over keeping people coming in will be more difficult. Still have to cater to the basketball and then baseball crowd but I think a Trivia Night or some standing event once a week could  bring people in.  Sullivans had a trivia night that brought a decent crowd. I have mixed feelings about live bands. Some nights Im into it but some nights if there is a live band I am finding a different bar because its too loud and I cant talk to anyone.I think making sure the sports crowd is always happy should be your  goal.  ,fredericksburg,cng8hh7,2,t5_2rpwd

3749645,0,t3_31mkg4,Out West on Rt.  in the Wilderness battlefield is a nice long trail called the Federal Line Trail. It goes . miles from Hill Ewell Road all the way through the woods and between  through Lake Wilderness and ends at Orange Plank road. Parking is only at the Hill Ewell trail head though so it would be over a  mile hike if you didnt have a pick up off of Orange plank or drop off there.My fiance and I just recently hiked it for the first time and we just went half way and then turned back for a nice . mile hike. We live off of Orange Plank so its nice and close would be a bit of a drive if youre coming from other areas though. But Ill say the entire Wilderness and Chancellorsville area are filled with cool little trails and historical landmarks.,fredericksburg,cqjoo7v,1,t5_2rpwd
3765480,0,t3_33f6mn,The Fredericksburg Field House has a bunch of rec sports including soccer flag football lacrosse and dodgeball. Most leagues have a house team as well made up of players that want to play but dont have a team to play with.For live comedy Cool Cow Comedy does shows at the Marriot in Downtown Fredericksburg. I think they do shows once a month or once every other month or so. Its generally not Alist comedians but most of them have decent credentials and the guy that runs it Rahmein is pretty funny.As far as live music goes I wouldnt say there is a ton out here. If you like country Celebrate Virginia Live does country shows during the summer. This is out near Central Park. If youre more into rock The Lafayette Agency does shows at Hard Times   mile fork. They also did a summer festival called Operation Rock Fest that included bands like Pop Evil Gemini Syndrome Nonpoint and Saving Abel. If you dont like country or rock someone else will have to help you out.Downtown Fredericksburg has a decent bar scene. Capital Ale House is good if you like craft beers. They have a huge selection both on tap and bottles. Jays is a fairly new bar but has been pretty decent the times Ive been. Brocks is a place that people seem to either love or hate. They usually have a cover and have a collared shirt dress code unless thats changed. I havent been there in awhile but do have dancing if youre into that. Theres also a new brewery Spencer Devon Brewery that opened or is opening that people seem to be excited about. There is also Blue and Gray Brewery down rt  about  minutes from downtown.For restaurants some that I enjoy are Otani Japanese steak house and Foode The owner was on one of the cooking shows. Top Chef maybe?I think that hits most of the topics so hopefully that gets you started. Let me know if you have any other questions. And welcome!,fredericksburg,cqlhrk0,2,t5_2rpwd

4372442,0,t3_3b3l0a,Crime not so much. That fiasco with the pepper spraying cop was a huge outlier. Housing is relatively expensive. A lot of people that work in Fredericksburg commute from Caroline county where housing is cheaper. Overall youll love the downtown area and all the historical parks. It may not be a city like New York but youll always be finding new things,fredericksburg,csiicu0,1,t5_2rpwd
4412314,0,t1_csmxj2i,The Northeast side of Richmond on the Henrico county border can be nice and would not be a bad location unless youre of the mindset that anywhere that isnt a newly built subdivision with a strict HOA is the ghetto. And the drive on  no matter where youre coming from isnt bad. Its backwoods so you just have to look out for deer more than traffic. ,fredericksburg,csn03kl,1,t5_2rpwd
4594212,0,t3_3dwwnr,If you livework in downtown Fredericksburg then it is very bike friendly. This year a few new bike paths have been opened up and the traffic in the city is fairly tame. It is when you go outside the city does it get a bit less bike friendly. Being near the university is great.There is both a decent art and music scene for a town this size. Plenty of live music mostly in a acousticsinger songwriter types. Plenty of events when the weather is nice. There is a big Octoberfest run every year downtown. As far as attitude it depends. You will see lots of left leaning types around town. There are plenty right leaning types as well but more so in the counties. Lots of people commute to DC so there is a large population that hasnt lived here their whole life.Fredericksburg is very safe. There is petty crime but overall I have never lived in a safer place. As always use common sense. Most theft happens when someone leaves a door unlocked.One thing that Fredericksburg has in spades is history. From the revolutionary times to the Civil War there is a little bit of everything. George Washington was raised here and lots of his family resided here. Speaking of go see Kenmore the home of his sister Betty. Very pretty.Fredericksburg also has some really good restaurants especially Downtown. Bistro Bethem and its casual sibling Vivify could easily exist in a larger city. La Petite for old school French where the chef plays some awesome jazz for free on Wednesdays. Foode which is really on another level. I could go on and on. I like food.The things it is missing for me is heavier music I like to Rock! good bagels and NY style deli. Though I think me being in south has more to do with that then Fredericksburg itself.,fredericksburg,ct9oy63,2,t5_2rpwd
