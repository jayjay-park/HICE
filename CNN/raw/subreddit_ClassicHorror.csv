9271310,0,t3_573yea,Back in the s I was trying to get some people interested in backing a faithful remake of I Am Legend which wouldve been filmed in Compton California where the story was originally set. When the book was written in the s it was a mostly white community but by the s it had become a black community and that was the key selling point of my presentation an horror film with an allblack cast and mostly black crew on a Roger Corman budget. Neville was going to be a plant manager who just didnt want to abandon his house because it was the only home he ever knew. Many of the vampires were going to be undead gang members orbiting around Nevilles house played by real gang members. Ruth was going to be played by an Asian or Latina. But in the end I couldnt get enough backers and Warner Bros. had other plans.  ,ClassicHorror,d8r7emr,4,t5_2ve37

10317742,0,t3_5mp0r4,Did anyone else give it a rewatch this week?  I just had a chance last night  and it was easily my favorite viewing of Day ever.  Its been a really long time since watching it and I usually reach for Night or Dawn to get a Romero zombie fix.  Its a really fucked up flick but it is way more fun than I remember.  How freaking great is the batshit crazy mad scientist Dr. Frankenstein?  The badies were fantastically psychopathic.  Seriously fuck those guys especiallys that cunt Captain Rhodes! Has there ever been a more well deserved zombiemauling?  Give that guy an honorary oscar for most punchable face ever  And as others have mentioned the great Bub easily one of the best zombies ever.  It was cool seeing a young Greg Nicotero in the mix as well.  Lori Cardille was great plus her dad Chilly Billy was briefly in the original NotlD.  Great pick by ukinggutter thanks man. Had a blast giving this another watch.I also just watched the documentary The Many Days of the Dead and its a bit sad hearing them lament the fact that the original script had to get dropped and their budget got cut in half.  At least they were allowed to make it unrated and without studio interference.  Though George was pissed off at first he surrounded himself with great people and made the best of it.  The amazing special effects certainly werent hampered by the lowered budget.  Even though he had to put up with some initial bullshit George ultimately said Day of the Dead was his favorite of the Dead films.,ClassicHorror,dcdkloj,1,t5_2ve37
