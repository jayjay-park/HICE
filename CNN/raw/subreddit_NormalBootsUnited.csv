5518845,0,t1_cwh2gnx,Thanks for the response! Whenever I make a video I always like to try and have at least one music track that is from the games Im talking about. In this case the track I used was the only one that Receiver actually has so I felt it had to be included. However I probably could have adjusted the audio levels in the beginning while it builds up Im just usually very worried that the music will be too loud so I often air on the side of caution. I also use headphones that pick up sounds in the background really well so I probably should listen to the video in different speakers while editing in the future just to make sure the video will sound the way I wanted on other hardware. When I posted this video to the Receiver subreddit I also got some feedback about the focus on how the mechanics work rather than their implementation or effect on the gameplay. Looking back on the video I definitely could have described how the complex mechanics effect the difficulty and make the player feel more vulnerable and whatnot.In terms of the dryness of the script Im not to sure how to minimise this. In the past Ive tried some more humorous content that just fell flat on its face so I guess that Ive just got to get the hang this stuff.Anyway thanks for the feedback again!,NormalBootsUnited,cwh2zcn,1,t5_2wpnb

7211258,0,t1_d1xc7n2,You comment you get reviewed haha!Dragons Lair Really impressive voiceover quality. You some kinda experienced actor or something? I definitely watched part of this before. It came out a while before I started doing these but maybe I was already looking for things to critique and I probably thought it was just too good to review. Not exactly a constructive thing to say but it is just too good. Great jokes editing and aforementioned VO. If I have one criticism its that sometimes the listing and explanation of the games problems can go on a little too long between jokes but like Ive said in everyone of these thats more my personal preference talking than anything. Plus the jokes that are there are some of the funniest Ive seen on this subreddit. I was a little worried about the reference to another video and then you actually put a link to the source of the joke which was great. I recognize our old money! I dont know about you but I get really excited when Canada is mentioned or other people are Canadian. Subtle patriotism has endeared you to me.I went and watched The Bouncer so I could give you some criticism instead of just figuratively sucking your dick but it was also really good. Even better than the first.Loved it subscribed go Blue...Leafs..? Do you sports? I dont sports.,NormalBootsUnited,d1xv3vy,2,t5_2wpnb
