6778163,0,t3_48icgc,There are two official Hellboy videogames. The first one is of course the universally panned and loathed HellboyDogs of the Night by Cryo. You can find the gameplay on youtube. The second is Hellboy The Science of Evil. Its an alright beat em up which leaned more to Hellboy movieverse in terms of design and story.There are also numerous Aliens videogames. While they are not licensed directly from Dark Horse comics they still deal with the characters from AVP universe.There was also a videogame based on Frank Millers . It was a cheap clone of God of War series and was exclusive to PSP.I didnt know about any Buffy videogames but if you check wikipedia you can see that there are six of them. Some of them are even on PS and Xbox or you can always find emulated versions.,darkhorsecomics,d0kl71t,2,t5_2snj5
