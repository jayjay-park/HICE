1371780,0,t3_29stks,We have the same major. The best advice I can give you is go to your classes and PAY ATTENTION. Youd be amazed how easy college is when you just pay attention in class. If you struggle with anything related to working out a problem I did in chem get a chegg account it costs a little money. It has the answers but much more importantly it has HOW to get the answers. Crossroads is pretty decent people will inevitably bitch about it but it is pretty decent. That being said freshman  is very real take advantage of the ARC its awesome. You will have a ton of free time so check out the areas aroud chatt too if possible me and my roommates went up on the mountains and chilled all the time.,utc,cio8oik,2,t5_2sh8a
4158079,0,t3_38a6ka,I stayed in Boling for two years and it wasnt too bad. Rooming with two friends will help. The convenient store next to the laundry machines is pretty cool. If youre not coming form far away itll make living on campus easier. There should be a good amount of groups at orientation to take a look at and there will be a lot of freshman activities to take advantage of. CRU House are Younglife are all Christian Ministries but they sponsor some cool things on campus. I met a lot of friends through Film Club several years ago so Im a little biased. I think youll get your schedule at orientation but the online schedule usually doesnt change much. Never buy anything from the bookstore unless you have too. ,utc,cru8dgc,1,t5_2sh8a
5880928,0,t1_cxqiiv2,Yes I know all too well this was nothing but my fault. I am just glad to know I am not alone. I believe policy in the university is that I wont be kicked out right now but will be put on probation. I need to fix these structural issues of mine before next semester really puts me into a hole. Thank you for your words of encouragement.,utc,cxqit88,1,t5_2sh8a

With my gear out and on. Ive never told anyone Im a journalist recording for a radio story. It is implied by the gear credentials mic pointed at them etc.gt This is of course not best journalistic practice.gt Even though she had a microphone clearly visible its clearly an ethical violation says Thom Storey a Belmont University professor of journalism. Thats one of the things that I stress in my classes  always make it very clear who you are and what you are there for.The severity of your screw ups matter. Getting  different elected officials on the record without clearly identifying yourself is one of those major screw ups. The controversial nature of the story makes it even worse. Had she done her investigating correctly then I doubt WUTC fires her. ,utc,dffvjfh,7,t5_2sh8a
