1259515,0,t3_28imiy,Tornado  is scud IMO.  If you scrub through the video back and forth so you can see the motion over the course of a second or two instead of two minutes its a lot easier to see the dynamics...its scud.  There is no rotation here.Tornado   hard to tell.  This looks better but I still cant pick out any rotation.,stormchasing,cibb77h,7,t5_2rjyx
3585426,0,t1_cponwec,The unwritten rule so to speak is DONT just blindly follow someone you dont knowhavent talked to. You have no idea if that individual has a clue what they are doing or if their personal mission for why they are out is going to include riskier moves like core punching etc for data collection or the like. Ask around talk to people you might get lucky. ,stormchasing,cq0ytcq,1,t5_2rjyx

3912062,0,t1_cr20ern,Yes that was almost due north. We pulled up on a spot with about  other chasers along N RD and watched it roll in front of us from the west. We all bugged out just as the RFD rain rolled in. Timelapse coming up very soon. Ill edit my original post.Probably since I use my phone as a hot spot and I have pykl running on the tablet it probably had the same affect Im guessing. Id say over  the time Pykl GPS location isnt correct. Not sure why that is either.,stormchasing,cr27lb3,1,t5_2rjyx
4989084,0,t3_3j9c25,Passed this along to a chaser friend of mine who can hopefully get it out to his network of friends. This subreddit isnt all that active unfortunately so hopefully he can get it out to other more visible areas to be seen. Sounds like a cool idea.,stormchasing,cundblc,3,t5_2rjyx

11274029,0,t3_60siae,PYKL was basically my preferred app since Im an Android user until they finally released Radarscope on Android. Radarscope is the best app and is very handy while storm chasing. I found PYKL to be a lot more unstable than Radarscope.Also if thats of any interest radarscope even covers the canadian radar network in their raw format which is kinda rare.,stormchasing,df9w7yv,2,t5_2rjyx
11364025,0,t3_626k76,I like the sentiment. No one gets a pass on road safety even if its TIV Reed Wurman whoever you consider at the top of the food chain.If youre driving and chasing your only job is to keep you and others safe on the road. Your partner is there for looking at the laptop or the sky. If you dont have a partner get one and barring that you need to safely pull off the road and stop.For years inattentive driving has been given a pass. Dont tell me how to chase. Witch hunts dont need to happen but chasers and those who enjoy weather need to be more adamant about not encouraging or engaging in inattentive driving.Tornadoes are  on my list of scary things. Its a tossup between other chasers and drunk drivers for  which shouldnt be the case.,stormchasing,dfk39uj,11,t5_2rjyx
11364774,0,t1_dfk39uj,Distracted driving  its complete speculation but most would agree its the most likely cause of this situation.  Hopefully theres a push in the community for team chasing no solo AND an emphasis on separation of duties between the driver and the partner.,stormchasing,dfk6bw2,3,t5_2rjyx
11366128,0,t1_dfkb3yn,So if you saw the video you would know that he was driving minimum the speed limit of mph.  You would see him pass two reflective signs that you can clearly read on the video saying intersection and stop ahead warning drivers on the highway.  Then you would see him come up to the intersection with no reduction of speed and the video cuts out.Just in case youre blind like Kelley..  heres the first sign then another oh and one stating theres a road and finally the intersection  Thats FOUR things he ignored all while wearing no seat belt.  Its not considered an unfortunate accident when you CLEARLY ignore all warnings break several laws and kill two innocent people and yourself.  I wish he would have survived his death is cheating.  He deserved to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing two people.Note Corbins road didnt have a stop sign he had the right of way and did absolutely nothing wrong ,stormchasing,dfkbuhv,3,t5_2rjyx
11367173,0,t1_dfkf24u,Really? Thats good. I miss him so much. I woke up this morning totally expecting to see his name in our group chat with all of our little group talking about his trip and then I remembered. ,stormchasing,dfkg3u2,5,t5_2rjyx
