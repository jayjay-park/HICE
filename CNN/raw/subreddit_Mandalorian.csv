1834402,0,t1_cka6yuq,Yeah this was the first time Ive met him in person. He really is fantastic. I also love how easy it is for him to put his armor on. He just lifts it up and puts it over his head and its pretty much done. It seems like it takes me forever to put mine on in comparison.,Mandalorian,cka8nyw,2,t5_2toao
3768226,0,t3_3209es,Irony of your question mandalorians dont actually have a word for hero just a little fun fact. uBlueSmoke got it in one with the clans wiki but their are tons of conversion dictionaries for englishtomando and mandotoenglish and some regular ones with phrases and individual words. I dont have the links handy right now otherwise I would post them  ,Mandalorian,cqlt0bz,1,t5_2toao

5535285,0,t1_cwj28c8,Not the corners really maybe just a touch but for the rest Id just soften them up take off the hard angles. If you look at Bobas armor it has a rounded quality to it.Foam? Sealed?,Mandalorian,cwj6jm0,1,t5_2toao
