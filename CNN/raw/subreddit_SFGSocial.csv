2296311,0,t1_clvjawt,Honestly theyre good with either vocalist as Ive seen both. The rest of the band is the same and the two vocalists are pretty spot on with their songs. I guess you could check out Howards new band too.,SFGSocial,clvjg6b,2,t5_32zks
2868115,0,t1_cnu3d06,Sturgeon is hot in the San Pablo bay right now but you need a boat. Without a boat I would go to Ocean beach for sandabs. In crab season the pier behind ATampT is a great place to throw nets. Also a big fan of Pacifica pier but you have to get there early. I actually live in Santa Cruz now born and raised in SF so I would probably go fishing over here in my kayak. ,SFGSocial,cnu3tbl,2,t5_32zks

3430936,0,t3_2zd6bn,Id love to participate but I should ask before actually doing this. I know basically nothing about college basketball so Id fill this out by coin flip. Actual coin flips the number of which Im trying not to think about at the moment. Im wondering how well this would work and it could provide a benchmark for everyone else ie Did I do better than the jackass with the coin flips?It could be a waste of a spot or unsporting or something so I though Id ask first. Thanks for setting this up!,SFGSocial,cpjcpd4,2,t5_32zks
3611536,0,t3_31npvo,If youre planning on visiting museums and taking public transportation you can purchase a pass that will will give you access to both. I forget the specific details but it was well worth for my wife and I when we spent a week there recently. We picked it up in the central station at a tourist help center near the entrance.What we didBerlinger Dom worth it for the climb to the top and the viewFernsehturm Berlin TV Tower in East Berlin. Visit at night.Karl Marx Allee  Frankfurter Tor grand socialist boulevard in East Berlin. Amazing architecture.Pergamon Museum Supposed to be the best museum in Berlin. I wasnt that impressed.Hamburger Bahnhof Contemporary Art Museum. A lot of interesting stuff but you wont enjoy it if youre looking for more traditional art.Kaschk coffee by daybeer by night. Great selection of beer on tap. There are other bars that have a decent beer selection but this was my favorite.Eat cheap falafel sandwiches.  euro theyre everywhere.We stayed in Prenzlauer Berg and if youre looking for a neighborhood to exploreshop in its the place to go. Tons of small shops selling anything you could want good coffee lots of great food.I truly miss Berlin. Such an amazing city. Its international very active awesome nightlife people were very openfriendly great public transportation system its very affordable... and the list goes on. It was one of the highlights of my trip to Europe.,SFGSocial,cq3xwcq,2,t5_32zks
