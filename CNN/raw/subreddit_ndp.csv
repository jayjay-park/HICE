5210297,0,t3_3m97dh,Is it really an attack website when all it is doing is showing what his positions are or have been?

5446794,0,t1_cw7tkfl,I dont disagree with keeping Mulcair on as leader as  years is a good stretch of time to work on the party and all things considered we did hang on to a good percentage of the Quebec vote. We can rebuild and save the CPC having a very charismatic leader keeping Mulcair on will give us a head start as he will already be a known to the population. However I think its clear leading into the next election we have to let Tom be Tom. Let him be aggressive and sharp in short Angry Tom and not let ourself be boxed in by committing to things that may or may not be possible. ,ndp,cw7vplv,3,t5_2qm8o

6651786,0,t1_d07clyc,I have no problem with Sanders ideology as such or his being ideological I have a problem with him having a rigid cast of mind.  subsidized college tuition is a great example its a massive giveaway to rich and middle class kids. That doesnt actually fit well with his ideas but hes convinced that it does because it seems to.In a sense it doesnt matter a ton. Sanders value to me as a politician is that hes willing and able to reach outside of traditionally mobilized networks to get new people involved in politics in a serious way. Obama did that as far as the ballot box but no further and in that sense Sanders represents a great hope of empowering ordinary people to take hold of their own government at every level.,ndp,d07cotd,1,t5_2qm8o
6948013,0,t1_d13vltc,Notwithstanding Sid Ryan and his ilk are why the NDP cant have nice things. The public has had ample opportunity to express its opinion of Sid Ryan at the ballot box  I believe hes been roundly defeated five out of five tries thus his success electing Conservatives.Edit what do I expect? I expect NDP friends and allies to keep their beefs inhouse. If Sid Ryan had done so in the s we might never have had a Mike Harris who was not exactly a friend of public sector workers.,ndp,d13vzry,1,t5_2qm8o
6948816,0,t1_d13q0xv,Rock solid base? The ndp won Alberta provincially the conservatives are cracking in Alberta federally. Do you really think Canadians that turned to the liberals this election will turn to the conservatives especially after Trudeau whispered  left wingsweet nothings into their ears? The logic does not compute. Poor performance at the debate? You mean when the ndp and mulcair took the high ground on the issue of the hijab even though it wasnt popular at the time. Sorry but I choose substance over political pandering any day. ,ndp,d13za8b,2,t5_2qm8o

11334704,0,t3_6046ti,Isnt the split really about whats politically possible?There are those within the party that wont waver on positions but perhaps dont realize that certain positions arent politically possible in Alberta. So the question is do you mend your position to govern and accomplish more of your agenda or stubbornly hold ideology and risk not influencing policy as much?,ndp,dfgrox2,3,t5_2qm8o
