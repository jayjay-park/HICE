9172152,0,t1_d8ejb7b,Gravity Kicking is way faster than shifting speed until shifting speed reaches about level  or so and that does not happen during the any run since we dont do any side quests. In  you would do it but we havent really tried  since the enemy side missions require a lot of sitting and waiting.,gravityrush,d8emzkd,4,t5_2ubb0
10113905,0,t1_dblowbe,Yeah I was assuming so drifting doesnt seemed to have changed and seems to still stick to different angled surfaces you touch excited to try the dlc more chronologically than at the end,gravityrush,dbpumqk,2,t5_2ubb0
10185582,0,t3_5luey0,I uploaded an uncompressed video but YouTube still managed to ruin the image quality. Anyway I really like the start screen for this game hopefully the full game will feature something similar. It also shows us some of the events that will take place in the game.I find it interesting that Raven is there with Kat when they discover that Cecie has been captured by whatever that weird human skull thing is. I dont think Raven will appear in the first part of the game from what we can gather as only Kat and Syd are transported to the Banga Settlement. I imagine Raven was separated and will only first appear in the city that we see in the demo curiously she appears to be wearing a mask when Kat first meets her.,gravityrush,dbylblx,2,t5_2ubb0
10187262,0,t3_5lvdnt,Id definitely recommend Gravity Rush Remastered. Its currently on sale on the EU PlayStation Store if youre in that region. Remastered contains all of the DLC of the Vita version and also features a considerable upgrade in terms of graphics not only a P resolution but also enhanced textures and D models and it runs at fps on top of that. DigitalFoundry has a good comparison video showing the difference between both versionsOn a side note its good to see that Overture managed to get people interested in the game!,gravityrush,dbys6gy,7,t5_2ubb0

10444590,0,t3_5pkzmu,Because theyre completely out of place in a game about you zipping around and falling through the air and for the most part limit you to just plain old walking around without using your powers.

10692364,0,t1_ddiqd66,Oh wow wish I knew about it. Id love to get the  tokens reward what does that talisman do anyways? but alas Gravity Rush  will have to be put to the side until DLC or so since I did finish everything else that could be done. Time for Nioh O,gravityrush,ddiu71q,2,t5_2ubb0

10945415,0,t1_de6lbel,Yeah I wouldnt be surprised if Raven gems count towards the statistics menu and K gem trophy but the Power Kat trophy requires more K anyway so unless they share upgrades Ravens gems wont really help. I got about K by thoroughly doing everything else in the game so I kinda suspect they meant for K to be what you needed for all upgrades but they miscounted or something. Or the mining system was supposed to yield a lot more gems. I had some trouble with High Went Alert too but dont give up! Heres how I got it a lot of people report it as being kinda glitchy  we definitely killed  people in  seconds with no pop. I think whats going on is enemies who get sucked into your typhoon dont count only enemies you shoot with debris. I got it in Chapter  No Messiah No Message first big battle. You have to replay this much of this chapter if you want all the photo collectibles anyway for the fish statue only reachable in this chapter. But any battle with  weak enemies should work. What I did was fly up waaay high above all the soldiers and the center of the courtyard before activating the typhoon. That allowed me to get more of them in line of sight at once and put me far enough away to not suck them in. Youre also less likely to get hit while activating the attack. When youre high up like that you also dont have to change the camera angle as much to sweep your aim circle across all the soldiers. I got the trophy on my first try from this position after several nonpops when I stayed at ground level while using the typhoon. Some other people got it in the first big fight of Chapter  a good spot for all the combat trophies. For some reason I couldnt get High Wind Alert here but this was before I realized the trick of fly way up high first. These enemies have more health than the human soldiers in chapter  but the fight is much earlier in the chapter if youre replaying. As for all the gems I replayed the gemrichest checkpoint of Chapter  for a few hours while I had my own audio playing to keep myself entertained. ,gravityrush,de8xxk2,1,t5_2ubb0
10977218,0,t3_5wmcnj,No it isnt. The first Gravity Rush suggests that the world is some sort of dream world within Kats mind. Gravity Rush  explains this more where Cyanea simply reveals that the dream she was trying to protect in GR was Kats dream of wanting to save everyone below. Hope this cleared things up. Edit As for the Kat and Raven stuff GR simply implies that the two were original one person. Thats all there is to it. Whether or not they were split at birth or split from someone much older into two young girls we dont really know. The only thing which supports the latter is the darkhaired version we see of Kat in Gravity Rush . ,gravityrush,dec8zjb,2,t5_2ubb0

11181709,0,t3_5zmson,Sales wise for a niche game I think its doing at a decent rate. Japan has sold over k copies in its fourth week making it the strongest in terms of region sales Media Create for source. I think theyre focusing on Japan as it saw a lot of marketing there compared to other countries.Now I know VGChartz is a bad place for reference because of their inaccuracy but they claim that it sold k copies in its first week globally. Personally I see this as good news since it outsold the original Vita versions sales in its first week. Currently it sold over k copies worldwide but it could be inaccurate.It is expected for the game to not break the charts since it had a rought start being a Vita exclusive at first. Not to shame the Vita but at the time not many people saw the appeal to it which caused only a handful of people to experience the game. Then again it is a niche title to begin with so I think theyre doing alright. Just a shame that many people slept on it,gravityrush,dezfmw3,10,t5_2ubb0
