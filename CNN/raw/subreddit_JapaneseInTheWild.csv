5788460,0,t1_cxeczaf,Its a long and hard process basically you have to do it one by one. Kind of like for English spelling you need to learn how each word is pronounced and how it is spelled. So for each Japanese word you need to know its kanji and its pronunciation.Each kanji generally has kunyomi Japanese pronunciation and onyomi Chinese pronunciation. Sometimes several of each. The onyomi is used kind of like how Greek and Latin are used in English to make compound words.To use  as an example   destination fingertip  The other day   Previous engagement appointmentSo as you can see  is pronounced as either  or  depending on the word its used in.

8440216,0,t3_4v6xy2, Spoilers Okay going to try something slightly above my level again First kanji is the kanji for death easy because people use TAHI for that on the internet or so Im told. The second kanji is... stick with the radical for source. that stick also appears in some kanji for other stuff and after trying it boku has it. SO I think its a person being the source of death. Now the hard part especially as I think I already made a mistake in spoiler   Spoilers Its not killer. That would probably have the kanji for person in it. I guessed Death and Person that gives. Im going to change my guess to cause for the nd kanji. Final answer Cause of death How wrong was I and what exactly is the radical on the left in the nd kanji?,JapaneseInTheWild,d5wkdq4,2,t5_3751t

9862689,0,t1_darrwdf,Hey nice work Your question s It is a bit of a strange choice of scripts. No definitive answer but scientific names of plantsanimals are generally written in katakana which is why you see  in the Wiki article. That said the product is more commonly colloquially? referred to without the  and in this case it would be written  or  as you can see on the sticker and flavoring packet. So writing  would draw less attention to what the product actually is and feel a bit strange. Itd be like writing Meleagris gallopavo bacon on a package instead of turkey bacon  Is it still bacon if its from a turkey?
