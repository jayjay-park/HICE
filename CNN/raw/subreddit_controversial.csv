752848,0,t3_22phc7,I was raised in a religious home as a hutterite. I have no qualms about that as I feel it gave me good values in life and thought me how to work hard. I feel that people use religion as several different things. Some use it as a business they desire to have power over other people and make them fear damnation if they dont believe what theyre told to. Some use it to ease the conscience they got due to the values they were raised to believe in. I do know some very intelligent people who are religious but as a rule I have to agree with your conclusion. Generally religious people werent raised to make decisions on their own and thought to believe what they were told and because of that most of them are narrowminded. P.S. I apologize for the atrocious grammar.,controversial,cgpusyx,1,t5_2qs0h

This is why the vaccine has become so popular in young women.It has little to no symptoms in men. If he broke up with you because of this perhaps he doesnt really understand what HPV is. Or perhaps he is just upset that you lied to him which I guess would depend on the circumstance and degree of the lie. Are you both very young? I feel like this shouldnt be an issue in a relationship between people of an earlier generation.,controversial,cka73wb,1,t5_2qs0h

4292557,0,t3_3052ws,My girlfriend works for a foundation that funds money to autism research. Like everything whats on the Internet does make them sound religious crazies but thats just the vocal minority. What is odd is that its seems soon we wont have to convince anyone because in some places they are making laws that will force people to vaccinate their kids when the government says. Most of antivac people I met through her only want to wait until their kids are a little older before pumping them up with shots. They are not anti vaccine but they dont give the CDC credibility to say no to forprofit pharmaceutical companies and lobbyists who sell a numbers of injections. These people get lumped into the Jenny McCarthys.So to answer your question I wouldnt try to convince anyone to do either. But give them information on what vaccinations have has worked their side effects how many shots I got as kid vs how many they get now history of the CDC etc. All positives all negatives. Intellectually see both sides.But let THEM decide for their kids not a corporate body with political influence.,controversial,cs9hqtg,1,t5_2qs0h

IMO thats the only reason anyone in the govt is talking about amnesty.  and IMO the only reason the Republicans are opposed to the idea is that the Democrats presented it first.,controversial,csywmif,1,t5_2qs0h

8738705,0,t3_4gc4zd,I used to work as a grocery store clerk. I worked late by myself with little backup and no courtesy clerk bagger. I always just bagged the groceries as i went. If you take a look in the basket before you start you can get an idea of how many bags you will need and how to distribute them equally. If youre a decent checker it shouldnt hurt your time too much if you just bag as you go. I took pride in being able to evenly fill bags at a fast pace while checking and it really wasnt that hard to learn how to do it. Good luck ,controversial,d6xzkqs,1,t5_2qs0h
