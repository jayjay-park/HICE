7981344,0,t1_d4cwhr3,Its actually REALLY hard to do a burnout and he obviously had no experience with it. You should try it at some point if you ever have a car that is going to the junkyard anyway. I bet you you will not succeed very quickly.,ShowoffsCrashingCars,d4d6ffy,2,t5_3d7e3

11621539,0,t1_dgdan3b,The horn is used to warn and alert other drivers who may not know you are there. In this case the driver had no way to stop so the horn is the only option ,ShowoffsCrashingCars,dgdb97o,23,t5_3d7e3
11655010,0,t1_dggnqwn,So heres my reasoning with this.  I disagree with you that the Peugeot should have seen the Morgan and been able to react because  Lets say the Morgan pulled out into traffic  seconds ahead of the Peugeot so we can go with the  second rule.  The  second rule works because the car in front of you is also moving at your speed forward and the two of you are slowing down together.  The  second rule is not going to help you if an object suddenly materializes  seconds in front of you.  I can see cars on the side of the road but its unreasonable to slow down every time a car is waiting to pull out because they might do what this Morgan did.  ESPECIALLY since the Morgan was on the OTHER side of the divided road and crossed the opposing lanes and didnt stop before attempting to pull into the Peugeots lane.  There is no reason the Peugeot should have assumed this was about to happen unless they are driving dangerously defensively slowly everywhere.  Again this is NOT how you pull into traffic.If I pulled a right on red or a left on red for the UK? and it wasnt clear for me to go would the person who rear ends me REALLY be at fault at all?  Because thats essentially what the Morgan did here just without traffic lights.I dont know the particulars of the road the cars were on but assuming the Peugeot wasnt speeding I dont see how the Peugeot can be at fault at all.  If they are thats ridiculous IMO.  Example If Im driving at night at least in the states and a deer runs out in front of me and totals my car I wouldnt expect to get a ticket for driving without due car and attention.I would be really curious to know how this instance actually resolves legally.,ShowoffsCrashingCars,dgh3yt3,3,t5_3d7e3
