12840,0,t1_ceft579,shoot ok  im sorry to ask im just nervous about getting this wrong  any thoughts on where to look and how to keep cost down? I just spent a lot on a PC for gaming etc and a bit troubled about shelling out so much to just write and maintain one app converted from android also what is the reasoning for not being able to upgrade  hardware requirements? I know absolutely nothing about macs or operating systems. Is OS X Mavericks a modern version? Would any version work for xcode?,iosdev,cefw9uc,1,t5_2s57z

3799043,0,t1_cqoy9ys,Thanks for replying! Im not overly concerned about the money I understand its very much about the experience but I am trying to work my way through college. I negotiated them up to the lower end of what you said but the initial offer was just  which seemed a little too low. Thanks again!,iosdev,cqpbjyo,1,t5_2s57z

6364242,0,t3_42tak0,Honestly I would just get some projects into the store. Maybe open source a small library of some sort. Assuming that you dont have any formal education other than the bootcamp youre going to have an uphill battle. Youre really going to have to prove that youve done more than follow tutorials that if you come on board youll be able to crank out some code and that it wont be garbage. I think having an app that you made solo that looks good is in the app store and has some download numbers is the shortest path to employment.Side note Be aware that to someone whos been doing objectivec dev for  years aka whoever is hiring you  months sounds like nothing. Its almost an insult to our pride that youre saying I can do your job after just  months. Not necessarily saying everyone will take it that way or you should be super afraid of that but a side of the coin that you should be aware of.,iosdev,czd1li3,2,t5_2s57z

8474051,0,t3_4vr5k7,Breakpoints are not something specific only to swift. Theyre a great debugging tool.Say you have a piece of code that is not working as expected wouldnt it be great to be able to see what the values are when that code runs? Or check if that condition is passing or failing etc....Enter breakpointsYou add a breakpoint simply by clicking on or close to the line number in Xcode. When youre running with debug enabled that is in the simulator or on an attached device when the code reaches that breakpoint the application will stop and you will be in the debugger. The console window allows you to type commands. Ex print foo. And that will print out the value of variable foo in that moment. You can also step through the code to see what line is executing next etc... The buttons are at the bottom right above the console once youre satisfied you can click the play button and execution will resume. The play button at the bottom not the one you used to run the appLookup tutorials on debugging and youll get more information.Note you can toggle breakpoints on and off by clicking on them. Do not worry though none of the breakpoints makes it into the final product so you do not have to worry about your app stopping while with a customer. They only work when connected to Xcode.,iosdev,d60sq7k,5,t5_2s57z

9805691,0,t3_5fo2a4,Your iOS PC is a Mac and you dont need to be a Developer Program member anymore to run your app on local devices. Testing on the device itself is preferable because the simulator is slower and may behave differently from a device.A used Mac should be fine but you should get something relatively recent.No idea about the Google Play Services. Even if theres an SDK for iOS available Ive never seen an iOS game use it.,iosdev,dalrfzu,1,t5_2s57z

11201058,0,t3_5zu6cd,The app doesnt sound very complicated so assuming the data is readily available APIs the actual code portion wouldnt take very long. The design architecture and any testing could take awhile and depending on who you chose could be as expensive as the code portion. Sometimes developers do both but usually not.I would probably charge  an hour US for a project like this and expect it to only take a few weeks depending on design and edge cases of course. So maybe kk US.Source iOS developerEdit Some initial questions I might ask would be . Is this for a specific city or the city the user happens to be in? If the latter what countries and languages should be supported?. Is there any sort of login or cross device capability?. Would there be a need to save or cache data? If so factor in recurring server costs.. Is there any need for an android version? There are many ways to write code for multiple platforms now and knowing up front saves a lot of time potentially.,iosdev,df1mjic,2,t5_2s57z
