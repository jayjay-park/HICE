624705,0,t1_cgb91jt,They are non OEM but very cheap. Seems like some parts fit great others not so much. The bumper wont be more than  from them. I believe primed as well.Or you can go with the dealer and thatll be around  for OEM unprimed. Google trdsparks for decent dealer prices.,SciontC,cgba316,1,t5_2wm00

8775998,0,t3_509cqj,I still have my  tC and on the highway I get  mpg in the city  mpg. It is a good reliable car. The trunk garnish that tends to break off I gotten it replaced as toyota did a recall. Im now ready to sell it I just got myself a  VW golf GTI SE. ,SciontC,d72o1dd,2,t5_2wm00
9365622,0,t3_58sxfs,Maintenance wise the tC can be beaten up a bit and just needs the basic work done at required intervals. I change my oil with synthetic w every k  k miles or so.

So when opening your trunk just press the button and lift from the edge of the trunk with your other hand.,SciontC,d935rdm,2,t5_2wm00

11647791,0,t1_dgg98mf,Id say Im pretty good at it too. The fact that its so infrequent makes it unlikely that its a mechanical issue though.  It might be catching on the reverse lock?,SciontC,dggahri,1,t5_2wm00
