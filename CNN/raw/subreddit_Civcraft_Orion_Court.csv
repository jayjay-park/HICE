1896414,0,t1_ckhkl1b,He attempted to supersede the integrity of the judiciary and executive powers. Performed a communist revolution by seizing the capitol building and slaying all office workers inside. This was a very dangerous act against the public safety of Orion.Additionally he placed fences obstructing the capitol as can be seen in his picture placed note blocks and threatening signs and attempted a revolutionas he claimed on the subreddit. He was asked to stop repeatedly by Norami before she pearled him. DarkJesus can stand as witness.Geckos claimed he thought he was acting under NL Military Orders which is even more dangerous.,Civcraft_Orion_Court,ckhpih5,3,t5_2zwkb

2130456,0,t3_2jahey,All claims relevant to Orion made in this thread  will apply to this trial as they are associated with the pearled player and his case. In addition let it be known that MinezCalvin is associated with the account RussiaZero as both accounts were pearled together. Edit I did not mean that they were the same person. I meant that they were pearled together.,Civcraft_Orion_Court,clamm24,1,t5_2zwkb
