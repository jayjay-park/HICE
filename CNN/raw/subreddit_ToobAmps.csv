686783,0,t3_21yfli,As ubuefordwilson mentioned it could be as easy as cleaning a pot. However I would guess its more likely some other component in that area of the tone circuit. Could be a bad part could be a bad solder joint. If youre not familiar with working with high voltage circuits definitely take it to a tech.  In the meantime some trouble shooting you could do to make his job easier and your bill cheaper would be to note whether it consistently does this always when cranked up or does it only happen after it has been on for a while. Is it only the bass control that effects it? Pull your preamp tubes one at time and note if the issue disappears when a certain tube is removed. Swap your preamp tubes around if they are the same type and see if it goes away. These steps will help eliminate certain aspects of the circuit as the problem.,ToobAmps,cgic7ax,2,t5_306ro

2837388,0,t3_2slhww,The difference in volume is approximately dB when speaker surface area is doubled. A x is thus dB louder than a x provided that you add  more of the same speakers.Efficiency will come into play if you add lets say  Vs to  Greenbacks. Generally speaking however the rule of thumb is a dB increase in volume for double the speaker surface area.An interesting thing you may want to check out is Kevin OConnors book about speaker design. In it you will find all kinds of useful information. You will also learn about detuned cabs and how a x detuned will have the roughly the decibel output of a x of the same speakers and not be directional. Its awesome stuff!,ToobAmps,cnqlvuc,1,t5_306ro

I would stay away from Blackstar Crate Behringer hughes amp kettner etc and the other newer budget tube amps as they are generally of poor build quality. Well established brands and models are more likely to be easier to service too as their schematics will be more widely known.Be careful of buying second hand.

7958482,0,t3_4o8wop,Preamp tubes generally have a more noticeable affect on tone particularly if youre going for a high gain tone. High gain tones get their distortion from the preamp whereas something like an AC gets distortion from both the preamp and driving the power section hard.  For els I like JJs theyre good middle of the road affordable tubes. For AXs there so many out there that you really just have to try some different tubes out. Preamp tubes are very subject to personal preference and can also get really expensive for NOS stuff. Just try out a few different brands and see what you like. ,ToobAmps,d4alwxi,4,t5_306ro

8789462,0,t1_d74c6vh,Im not terribly knowledgeable about electronics so forgive me if I use incorrect terms. I was thinking hum sounded similar to if you have your guitar plugged in amp turned up unplug the cable from the guitar and touch the tip or something. It also doesnt sound like the hum you get from classic single coils when they arent being played. This noise moves strictly with the volume level sounds like TV antenna white noise and is completely unaffected by any guitar signal going through the amp. When played the guitar sounds just as it should but with that annoying noise in the background. As I said it even makes the same noise with nothing plugged in at all.The amp has had this noise for quite a while even before the tube swap. I will try your advice and swap the tubes one by one to see if that changes anything but I doubt it will.Sorry for saying dead silence  I know its not possible nor entirely desirable. I just want the quietest rig possible without sacrificing dynamics.I have the guitar cavity shielded as well and I know it isnt picking up and interference that is typically prone to single coils.

Next check that your instrument cable that you used as a speaker cable still works on another amp. If it doesnt its possible it fried and could have taken out the output transformer with it just as you put the guitar downhighly unlikely since your werent cranked up and the amp was left idle afterwards. If the instrument cable is good I would suspect the preamp tubes or toasted resistors leading from the high voltage to the preamp stage.,ToobAmps,dcazopu,1,t5_306ro
