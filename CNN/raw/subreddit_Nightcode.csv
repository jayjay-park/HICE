1115956,0,t1_chtor5k,Ahh maybe I am stumbling on what you already fixed then. Another thing that would be helpful would be a hotkey to unfocus the find field and go back to exactly where the cursor had been previously.,Nightcode,chv56fz,1,t5_2y4q1
7978316,0,t3_4lqsmo,After seeing the Defold Editor architecture video I became intriqued with JavaFx.  So I think this is a cool thing.  Nightcodes parinfer support is seriously awesome so I am happy to see it continue to evolve.  I use Nightcode every day.  It would be great to have first class Clojurescript support and a way to render things like devcards to the output window.  Plus one for a gorrilarepl or devcards like output capability to output rich graphics tables or controls to an HTML view.  HTML game programming in a tight loop would be sweet too.Just to be a devil advocating however  Recently Ive spent some time with the Atom Typescript plugin and it has impressed me with what is possible in an Atom pluggin.  This makes me wonder if a customized Atom with a pluggin would be a nice long term option. A fork of atom could remove the controls you do not want beginners to be burdened with.  Keeping the clean feel of Nightcode. That most of the functionality is in an Atom pluggin would mean that more experienced developers could mix up the base Atom using the pluggin and have a more full editor experience or just use other pluggins.  Need to be able to run more than one lein profile? Run with args etc. just hack it in quickly to Atom without changing the editor the pluggin or the basic AtomgtNightcode fork. Probably something would be lost in a big way however in terms of the sandboxing etc.  Nightcodes clear focus makes it very solid.  Building on another editor will at some point leak through no doubt causing some issues keyboard binding etc.,Nightcode,d4cu6fn,1,t5_2y4q1

Itll take some work to figure out how to deal with editing conflicts but I sure do intend on tackling that.I may indeed have to start asking for donations because my server is very expensive and Im currently unemployed  But before doing that I may try a few monetization ideas first.,Nightcode,dcpzb1u,1,t5_2y4q1
