Overall I felt like the grounds themselves at Legacy were nicer than at Paddock but the insides of the apartments at Paddock were nicer bigger and cheaper than the insides of apartments are Legacy.Some little thingsLegacy requires you to buy renters insurance at a very high amount of coverage and also requires that you rent their washer and dryer for mo if you wanted to use your own you would have to remove and stores theirs on your own and still pay for the mo.Paddock club makes you buy their cable package from Cox for mo and trashpest control for . Even if you never plug in your cable you cant opt out. Not a huge deal if you planned on getting cable but I havent bought cable in  years.Legacy felt like a used car dealership they didnt want to give me apartmentsprices that were available and tried to just get me to sign a lease with a vague price range. Paddock had a printout of all available apartments with prices and were able to explain the price differences between the same types of units.

1538926,0,t1_cj93ndc,Depends on what you want to be near really. Rule of thumb if youre inside the city of Gainesville youre most likely dealing with GRU. If youre in Alachua County chances improve that youre in Clay Electric Area. Offhand I know theyre in west Gainesville starting around the Mentone Development and into Longleaf. Mentone is a bit cheaper as they were built in the ss but they are less energy efficient. x walls instead of x. Theyll most likely have thermal windows though which is positive. Most importantly its Clay Electric so youre dealing with a lot less bullshit in general. Prices are going to increase as the biomass plant comes online. I work as an accountant so I see a lot of business bills for energy and the difference between GRU and Clay Electric can be staggering. Because GRUs tier rates hits single family homes and businesses so much harder than anyone else you can see savings of  during the summer.Longleaf is probably the most low cost energy bills per single family house youll get in Alachua County. Newest homes so youll see x walls fresh insulation energy efficient roofs energy efficient appliancesAC. Clay Electric area. People with  sq ft homes have electric bills not go past  there.So thats the west side. Im not sure where GRU stops their coverage along the east or north side. Obviously theres really not much you can do south side as theres not much in the way of development.Obviously moving is a giant expensive hassle and I wouldnt recommend moving to avoid GRU unless you were already planning on moving. If you really like where you are and solar panels is an option thats a really good way to stay under GRUs fuck you homeowner tier. You could do the math to see how much power youd need to keep you below that tier and plan accordingly using rebates and tax subsidies to their fullest. That could allow you to hold off on all appliances or AC or really inconvenient lifestyle changes unplugging everything turning off the AC when going to work etc.,GNV,cj96gmp,3,t5_2qwrf

3225600,0,t3_2x1sc0,wine craft beer liquor and cigar bar... for college students?Ill be blunt It sounds like jack of all trades master of none. Do you want a downtown bar or a college bar?This is a broad generalization and not  correct but fwiwMajority? of undergrads are the midtown crowd and those who are not go to midnightatlantic. What do these places have in common? Why does Midtown draw such a large crowd? Theyre cheap. c pitchers s  all you can drink etc. I know plenty of undergrads who have never gone to a bar Downtown because they think it is full of old people andor because it costs more money. The Top bridges the two a bit but otherwise I see mostly older people in Downtown. By older I mean older than  yr old undergrads gradphd students young professionals and more towards middle age people. Nothing wrong with that and I mostly count myself to this older crowd rather than the midtown crowd but I dont think the two will ever fully mix. People want different things. A cigar bar attracts a narrow crowd Id think this would require selling more expensive drinks pricey craft beer and fine winespirits to make up for the lower number of patrons which further alienates much of the college crowd.On a side note I know this is reddit where dumb nicknames are plentiful and this is all anonymous but Id be skeptical of any bar ownermanager that used the word nigga to refer to themselves. How you present yourself matters.What I want in a bar downtown is this  An atmosphere that allows for talking! Games board games cards or more active games are great but only if you can socialize without having to yell and scream to make yourself heard while you play. Maybe Im old but most places midtown are just too damn loud. Club music belongs in clubs not bars. Craft beer where the beer is more than just another tap handle. That is staff that knows maybe even enjoys craft beer and can tell me more about a beer than just I think this one is like bitter? or has lots of hops?. I dont mind if you sell Bud and Corona but if I ask What beers do you have on tap? and the waitress starts off with Bud Bud Light Miller Miller Lite Mich Ultra... that isnt a good sign.Beer samplers like those pack trays of oz pours at a reasonable price.Decent food at a decent price! Doesnt have to be fancy you dont need a hundred menu options but the average bar food in GNV is mediocre at best. Cover charges are for clubs not bars.Nonsmoking.Good friendly staff. Train them before you open. First impression matter.Outdoor seating. Gainesville doesnt have enough of this. Rooftop seating is cool too just throw up some optional shade but anywhere that allows for some fresh air sunshine and people watching is great.Good places to sit and good places to set your beer if youre standing. Personally if Im going somewhere for a beer and maybe some food I dont mind picnic tableslong tables they can foster socializing and are less limiting than booths. If Im going somewhere to sit down for dinner I prefer a booth or private table. Maybe itll help show where Im coming from if I say that FM is my new favorite spot in Gainesville. The only thing I really miss from there is some decent food since the quality and value of the food trucks varies.tldr Do you want to attract college students?Edit You might crosspost to rufl,GNV,cowc5vc,26,t5_2qwrf

Nice little swimming spring not much of float one though. And had a little beach thing.Things to bring? One crucial thing for me when floating is twine. You can tie your flip flops and other things to your tube. You dont wanna do the walk back bare foot. I love bringing a mask snorkel and fins also.

Heres a report from the Chamber of Commerce in   Page  shows the rates per kWh and again GRU tops the list.GRU is exceptionally high and if you find this factual information unreasonable then I challenge you to show some evidence that GRUs prices are anywhere near average.

The same storm that killed  people in Haiti and had decimated their whole country and reeked havoc in the Bahamas and many parts of the Eastern part of Florida. And youre simply upset because it wasnt as bad in Gainesville. You should be happy,GNV,d8j2duh,3,t5_2qwrf

GRU has the highest utility rates in the state and the state I am originally from has the highest in the Southeast through SCEampG and one of the top  highest in the country. I lived in a  BR  sf house here and paid over  a month for electric and I only have ONE choice for utilities here. ONE. and ONE choice for high speed internet.

10696682,0,t1_ddj733w,I mean youre not going to get a workout the way you would with lifting an active game of basketball etc. That isnt really the point imo. But you are getting outside and walking a few miles at a casual pace and doing minor exertion with the shooting its not like a frisbee throw in your casual frisbee game so its active. Youre trying ideally to launch this disc  feet which is not easy. I dont drink but I enjoy a nice afternoon at the disc golf park. I mean whats the appeal of video games? Or putt putt? Or insert any activity here? Its a semicasual activity that you can do alone or in groups that lets you hang out in a nice shaded park with a low barrier to entry but high skills cap to engage in. ,GNV,ddja7b9,4,t5_2qwrf
