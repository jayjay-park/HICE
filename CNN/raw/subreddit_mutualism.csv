21302,0,t3_1ud665,A true mutualistic insurance company would only be able to profit so much as it takes for the people laboring and servicing to want to keep the business going which means premiums wouldnt go up for one person who gets into a car crash by an exorbitant amount they would rise and fall the same for everyone as the amount of damage caused by accidents rises and falls respectively. Mutual insurance is thus a reciprocal covenant of sorts. You pay money to the insurance company the same as everyone else and receive the same potential treatment as everyone else i.e. you wouldnt want to get a  onesizefitsall check even if everyone else did youd want the same guarantee of full repair of damagereplacement of property regardless of cost.Ideally everyone pays the same amount no matter what however this can rise and fall as costs rise and fall. Everyone thus receives the same guarantee of service. Of course certain plans can be created for affordability necessity etc. but affording insurance is likely to be less of a problem in a postcapitalist society. Of course for people endeavoring to take on mutual insurance in a capitalistic society these are serious issues.Company ownership is thus a bit of a red herring. Company ownership is a legal fiction. What matters is how the people of a company or association interact.,mutualism,ceguwtg,3,t5_2rmzs

956587,0,t1_chcibng,The way that the cornstandard works is simply as a widelyshared experience. The difficulty in creating such a standard in modern society is the lack of widelyshared laborexperiences. If you look into the labor exchange literature you find attempts to create multifactor models for comparing labor but all of them have similar problems  its hard to find shared experiences of labor  its hard to find labor that most individuals find equally arduous. But assuming you can come up with a modern standard one house of strenuous floorscrubbing or whatever the question of individuals overestimating their own labor is presumably taken care of my the fact that nobody is obliged to complete any particular deal and people will price themselves out of the market. Warren was explicit that for example lazy people should charge more for their labor and nobody should expect them to take less if a deal was struck but that their laziness would obviously become a disadvantage in the market. All of these considerations are of course separate from the difficulties associated with appraising the mortgaged securities from a mutual credit system. The way to work out what parts of the traditional systems you might want to draw on is almost certainly going to be thinking about the specific problems that you want to solve with specific currencies.,mutualism,chd0tfd,1,t5_2rmzs
3717868,0,t1_cqftcs6,Well Mutualism certainly falls under the category of Market Socialism at least imo. However in rMarketSocialism there is a wider crowd of people some statists  Individualists Titoists platformists even a couple AnCaps and Communists. I want the sub to explore Market Socialism in a wider context and develop the field. Some of our conversations have even made it to rSocialism.I think inherently considering all market ideologies nonSocialist is a mistake. And this false dichotomy that is damaging to Socialism as a whole. EDIT And yes I am trying to get the sub more active but its been a chore. However I consider it my passion. ,mutualism,cqg2aia,2,t5_2rmzs
6459501,0,t3_442dn1,gt Anarchism is necessarily antipropetarian.I dont think you can make that claim joke. Public PropertyUnOwnable PropertyPersonal PropertyPrivate Property.Not all of those would require enforcement by the state nor exchange across markets or recaptured during warfare. One can easily resist hierarchical control while maintaining one owns toothbrush personal property. Do you have some good ideas for how nomadic anarchists such as in desert locations would provide for exclusionary activities ? Activities such as having sex in ones tent would necessarily exclude all but those involved. This exclusionary tentdomain can be thought of as softproperty. Devoid of State ownershipirrelevant yet remains a way to exclude some and include others.,mutualism,czngesd,4,t5_2rmzs

8543057,0,t1_d68q9ne,gt Mutualism and collectivist anarchism do have a lot to say about the management of natural resources and productive organizations particularly industrial scale organizations.What do you think of as industrial scale? There are areas where small groups of people even individuals are able to create works that many people can consume. An individual could probably create enough candy to sell to hundreds of people given the right machinery for instance. In artistic areas visual art literature music games etc. an individual could create something that an infinite number of people could consume.Say Im creating a computer game that could take special software a computer recording equipment for production of music and sound effects work space maybe a camera to create textures or videos to incorporate into the game maybe musical instruments or materials to create visual art that could go into the game and so on. People could use all the resources involved in creating any of those things for other purposes.gt What more specifically do you have in mind here? The way the question is asked it seems on the level of you dont want people to know youre growing pot in your moms basement. No youre right that isnt significant work and no no one would care what you hoarded to do so.Why wouldnt they? They could use the soil fertilizer water tools electricity and landspace to grow food for others. Am I not depriving them of that?gt Private land tenure is not prohibited in Mutualist thought though absentee landlords are.Can you explain more clearly how this would work? I have asked on this subreddit about occupancy and use property norms before and read some writings by Carson Wilbur Tucker and Proudhon but I still dont understand clearly what principles are relied upon.I guess those are my main questions right now. Thank you so much for taking the time to write out a reply twice in fact. I know how you feel with your browser wiping your first response.,mutualism,d69g9rz,2,t5_2rmzs

11491667,0,t1_dfykecy,ur right of course but likethis is more of a feel thing. Ancaps will be extra attracted to technology and read scifi that is transhumanist oriented. It does not look communistic or redin fact the blue color of flag they are using may excite them and look like computers or something. I also see a few ppls claiming to be transhumanist over in anarchism with free market type flair descriptors. Some ancaps like neitszche and in a transhumanist manifesto i got a hold of they were mentioning neitszche... those were my thoughts. the manifesto felt fresh exciting and technological basically...,mutualism,dfykv6j,1,t5_2rmzs
11746711,0,t1_dgqq9na,The land isnt being sold though nor is the house even being sold. As I explained above its more proper to think of sales as merely rewards for labor. The only thing that carries any semblance of ownership is occupation.So here is how the process works in full. Lets say you come to me asking for me to build you a house. I agree and we strike up a contract where you pay me based on the amount of hours of labor involved and the cost of needed materials. I find some unused piece of land and build the house on it. You pay me for the labor and then move into the house. You now have some rights as occupier of the house but these are contingent upon usufruct norms. In other words  you lose them when you stop occupying the house. The land around the house is kind of a separate issue. If its land you are using or is necessary to you in some way then that land too might be considered to be usufruct but only so long as you were really using it. So how much land comes with occupying a house wouldnt be some arbitrary amount. The seller of the house has no power to determine that or include it as part of the sale and the buyer wouldnt own the land in any normal sense of the word. If the land was being used by multiple people it would just be considered public property even if that public property extends right up to your doorstep. On the other hand if its a house in a rural area with no one else around there might be a little more leeway but you can still only hold land that you are making gainful use of. So unless you are a farmer or something the portion of land that falls to you as a home owner would likely be pretty small even if you live in a rural area. Thats not to say you would be prevented from moving about freely though. So long as the land is not being actively used by anyone youd be free to do as you please with it under responsible limits. But this does not necessarily bestow ownership on you.,mutualism,dgriphk,1,t5_2rmzs
