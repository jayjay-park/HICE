8780363,0,t1_d72ereu,I understand the lack of Dzongkha language resources but you did your best as a nonnative.I think you covered the crucial aspects of Bhutanese history pretty well.I would have loved to listen to your views on GNH as many foreigners I meet shrug at the idea of measuring that is innately immeasurable. Also there was a brief skirmish in southern Bhutan in ? when militants from Indian northeast set up camps in Bhutan. The militants were driven away eventually. I dont know if you are aware but a sizable lhotshampa population still remain in Bhutan I am one myself. It is quite obvious that some innocent Bhutanese fell prey to the chaos and turmoil in the s but the majority of those that found home in eastern Nepal were not Bhutanese as per  rule. I think this is one thing that most outsiders take for granted thinking that all lhotshampas were driven away.Taktsang is a great sight even to me every time I climb up there. I think every one visiting Bhutan should visit Taktsang. ,bhutan,d737s0f,1,t5_2qpdv
