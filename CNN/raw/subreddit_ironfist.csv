11224548,0,t1_df32726,Indeed. The rapid jumpcuts in most fight scenes are usually used to cover up a lack of actual action or coreography. Do fifteen takes of punching someone take the best one do fifteen takes of kicking repeat repeat repeat. ,ironfist,df4aed6,1,t5_2v24j

11252834,0,t1_df6n6jk,Your complaining about plot and pacing though. Op is talking about choreography and both season  and  of DD had amazing choreography. In comparison iron fist feels like it was rushed and made by a  year old. ,ironfist,df7hq4d,2,t5_2v24j
11259683,0,t1_df88yt2,I thought the same thing in the article it says hes the son of a renown choreographer.  But his one scene was garbage.  I sure hope he had nothing to do with the choreography for this show because it was a train wreck. ,ironfist,df89o3l,5,t5_2v24j

11276155,0,t1_df9z8pi,Yeah quite a few people have been saying that to him on twitter! Its quite surreal. He auditioned for the main part and didnt get it. But they dont tell you that you dont get it they just never call. And then he got a call about the part he did get and he pretty much broke down.His dad Philip Tan does stunts hes had a few acting roles but I think Lewis always wanted to take it further and be able to move into something more like serious acting but its suprisingly difficult for half asian half white guys to get anything. This role was still playing to his race but the response hes gotten has been pretty epic. After a decade of trying it looks like he might be getting a break  Fun times!,ironfist,dfa4wfy,18,t5_2v24j

11293742,0,t1_dfc4gw3,I mean I literally just watched the scene where Ward asks his sister if she would leave the company and come with him. Great performance not sure whats wrong with the writing. If the show gets better as it goes on like Ive heard then I dont see why this is such a shitty first season of a show. ,ironfist,dfc4o8f,1,t5_2v24j
11295705,0,t1_dfb2lmv,Its kind of a trope for boxing in films and TV. Its all about those power punches and punching from the arm with zero attention to footwork and head movement. Its a shame because good feints head movement and footwork looks really good yet most shows or films focus on constant power punches.,ironfist,dfcco7b,1,t5_2v24j
11300704,0,t3_61a0qf,I guess Im not supposed to be enjoying this then?I agree that the actors and writing need some help but as a Trek fan Im used to the first season of a new series being rough.Im through Episode  and holding steady. It does almost feel like they filmed these episodes in reverse though. Dannys Kung Fu and acting is getting worse as he goes instead of better which is really strange and like I said makes me wonder what order these were filmed in.Still I will push on and I look forward to a nd season. Im really looking forward to the PowerMan  IronFist combination!,ironfist,dfcx27u,17,t5_2v24j

11310371,0,t1_dfdzsqv,Its just remarkable. As if the writers completely forgot what they did with her in the previous  and  episodes.  I understand yeah maybe you place some of the blame on Danny for his Harold death but come on if they want to make her start feeling the urge to murder her childhood friend at least ease into like damn it threw me so off guard.,ironfist,dfe0hhq,1,t5_2v24j

11345423,0,t3_61vf8v,Finn Jones was bad but the lines he had to work with his storyline in general and the action sequences certainly contributed to him looking really bad.The buck has to stop with the people who made the show the writers directors and the creator.

11364946,0,t1_dfk2h2s,...You realize Asian people have made this criticism too right?Disagree with the criticism if you like but at least understand it. This isnt a matter of white SJWs guilty that theyre white. People from a variety of ethnic backgrounds dislike Iron Fists backstory for a variety of reasons because they see it as the white saviour trope because they see it is a missed chance for AsianAmerican representation because they see KunLun as a wishwash orientalist playground and not represenative of the cultures its based onand so forth.,ironfist,dfk7150,7,t5_2v24j
11368882,0,t1_dfkm438,I think you are taking the Angry part of the title too literally. Hes pretty good at pointing out issues and not going overboard with hyperbole. Many of his posts are just news reporting so sensationalized outrage manufacturer is a big stretch. Just because most Asians internalize and dont speak of issues doesnt mean they wouldnt agree with this blogger. On the subject of Iron Fist of course WTF u talking about? would be the common response. Most Asians dont read comics or knowcare to know about a character named Iron Fist. Many other life priorities comes before a comic book show. Are you Asian btw? If not then you should probably not try to explain their mentality with your own perspective. i.e. You never see asians complaining abiut white privilege for a reason. They understand hard work as a cultural concept.,ironfist,dfkn2uz,4,t5_2v24j

11534478,0,t1_dg39189,Nah the actors there are charismatic and almost endearing to watch even if the story is bad. I judge shows that are bad but I still watch with how many saving graces they have. Thats my take on Carter S Peggy Jarvis Jarviss wife forgot the name the female Villain forgot the name the mafia guy Stark were all charismatic in their roles. Issue with the show was the tone and the ridiculous plot. AoS S first half is goofy and clich because its almost a kids show but otherwise internally it works. They give you the sense of super agents going on adventures saving the day once a week.Iron Fist has no saving grace. ,ironfist,dg3folt,1,t5_2v24j
11584700,0,t1_dfr099g,gt Jessica Jones She doesnt know how to fight. She uses her strength for intimidation also bluffs she is bulletproof and infiltration. A capable Hand member can subdue her with a poisoned blade. She is the least durable. Also she might be the first one to quit the team.Add to that  She can fly.  or guided falling as she calls it,ironfist,dg94sf2,1,t5_2v24j
