80976,0,t3_1uym6x,Okay regarding the theme. I called it Soft Redux. You can get it here I assume you guys know how to install. Find the themes folder copy it in and unzipunarchive.What it includes Framework for circle icons A bunch of icons modified to look good in circles Removes the camera lockscreen icon but keeps functionality Clock and calendar theme appliedWhat it doesnt include Removal of the lockscreen arrowchevron but I posted a comment here describing how to get rid of it. the rest of the Soft Remix iconsFor the rest of the icons you guys can download the official Soft Remix theme then just copy in the folders you want inside Bundles. You can also edit the icons to fit circles using Paint.NET or something relatively simple. Most of them have a vertical gradient so you can use that to your advantage.When Soft Remix . officially comes out Ill edit a few more icons for myself and I can post that too if you guys want.,iOSthemes,cenncbz,2,t5_2w997

In MMis defense most flat themes look identical  Or are just so damn similar that you have to be intimately familiar with them.Just keep calm and move on.

658097,0,t1_cgf0fjw,Of course I have other tweaks! I use Winterboard for an bit theme I use Bytafont  for bit font. I use Activator though I have no gestures set for it. Hiddensettings is another that lies unused. Hiddensettings Winterboard and Bytafont  are the only ones that have any effect on my lockscreen just the font. Heres how I narrowed it down to your addon First I killed off any running apps and restarted my phone.  One at a time I went through my location services toggles and one by one turned them off and resprung until I found Compass Calibration to be the culprit.   With compass calibration set to on and KungFu on when I unlock I get the location sharing icon by the battery in the top right of the screen. If I go to Cydget installed by your addon and turn off KungFu then respring when I unlock there is no location sharing icon on screen even though the compass calibration is on.  I then go to my settings and turn compass calibration off. Then I go to Cydget and turn Kung fu back on respring and it does not show the location sharing indicator.I dont know the specifics of the other apps I am using or what they connect to I just know I never get that indicator unless I am checking weather. When I see it I pay alot of attention to what apps and addons use it and why. I suppose it could be some interaction with another tweak I will troubleshoot further and let you know what I find.,iOSthemes,cgf2puj,2,t5_2w997

904947,0,t1_ch74y25,The theme used is Gleam.Icon shapes were acquired using a previous themes icon mask. The theme was Flat.Badges were created using Boover.Dock used is ClassicDock.Weather widget is iWidgets with Flexy iWidget addon.The folders at the top were created using a mix of Springtomize and FolderEnhancer to get the no blurred background and x preview.Statusbar comes with Gleam and also OpenNotifier is used for the messages icon.,iOSthemes,ch75c14,1,t5_2w997

Yes this theme is different and yes some might like it but statistically more people are going to buy a flat theme on cydia because thats whats popular.

For this I wanted to create something practical unlike what in my opinion the iPhone actually allows for on its original state. Wanted to create a hub where at a glance you could have all the information you would need without the need of having to scroll move tap access apps etc and personally I think I have achieved this with this setup while maintaining a high level of minimalism which as some may know is what I lean towards. enjoy. Fell free to comment. Of course there are some Id like to thank as I do not own all that you see. Jeeepers for original code for all widgets including LS.

And then theres another difference between downloading and using stuff to pimp your phone and designing and more importantly coding the stuff. The latter seems even more of a male thing to do.

Unzip it and place it in varmobilelibraryCustomFolderIcons. Then  for example if you wanted to have a Social choose the .png that has Social. Name your folder Socialx.png without quotes. Respring to apply changes and you might have to adjust some things via CustomFolderIcons in the settings but it walks you through it.

It cant really conflict with anything because it only uses winterboard. Do you have any tweaks for the bootlogo? Thats the only thing I can think of. The status bar and Control center are themed but almost all themes have that so this issue wouldnt be new for you. Installing CrashReporter would definitely help.

Your saying that if you wanted to perhaps mix Gunnii with Cordyceps and lets say Gunnii is an IconBundles theme... It wouldnt work. If you activate both in winterboard no matter what Gunnii overrides Cordyceps because its IconBundles. Right?BUT...if you delete the mail phone Safari and music app icons from Gunnii Cordyceps will theme them. That is how you can mix IconBundles with nonIconBundles themes.,iOSthemes,coc2mgl,1,t5_2w997

Save the image you want as the icon as icon.png note the lower case and the image itself should be the size of a normal icon Open iFunBox  and navigate to varmobileLibraryWebClips Your new bookmark should be right at the top but with a weird name. Replace the icon.png with your icon.png You can also play around with Info.plist to change it to full screen or status bar color or whatever. Repsring.,iOSthemes,cpg7s7y,0,t5_2w997

Its free and fantastic it lets you search and import smart objects directly to the current layer  Gotham icons are  pixels thick. To take care of that rasterize your imported glyph right click the layer ctrlclick the icon to select its shape contract the selection by  pixels via the select menu then mash the delete button.I still prefer drawing things from scratch or at least properly tracing them with the pen amp shape tools but this is always a nice quick fix. ,iOSthemes,cq1e42t,3,t5_2w997

3720474,0,t1_cqgc84e,Who suffers here? The original creator to a certain extent.It is one thing to be inspired by other icons but another to outright copy them. There are simply too many elements being copiedborrowed from the original icons.Another example  The original is from cordyceps. I dont think you can argue your way out of this one. I know this issue entirely subject to ones interpretation. But the way I see it youre not respecting the original creators efforts by copying his design attributing it to yourself and subsequently receive compliments on how great it looks. I have seen enough themes to be certain enough to say that TAKE creator of imarashiku was the first to come up with the mountain and sun icon design for the photos app.Whether anyone buys this theme or whether its free is a secondary issue. The fundamental problem here is that it is not right to significantly copy existing icon designs and pass it off as your own. If they were distinctly different from the original then it wouldnt be a big problem. But here it isnt. And that bothers me.,iOSthemes,cqgczi4,3,t5_2w997

Then stuff happened and it was taken down then moved to a private repo I think? Then kvasir . was released with all new icons which Id imagine lowered the total themed icon count by a ton I made hundreds of third party icons for the original. Unless he still included those but I dont think so. Anyway. Long story short theyre around somewhere but im not sure the author wants me reposting them anymore.

Rename it to the EXACT name of the icon you wish to replace example xxxxxxx.png Copycut that icon and move to the folder for the appicon bundle containing the icon you wish to replace. Hit edit clipboard  paste. Then rename file you are replacing i.e. add the digit  to end of file name This will preserve the original for future use. Now respring and enjoy.

Ended up not keeping the theme and went in another direction and just happened to notice that it went away. I had just chalked it up to a conflict with the status bar tweaks and kind of forgot about it honestly. Might be worth posting up a tweak list.

8748826,0,t1_d6z8eec,Its in the UI when you download Zoobhoy Eight. You can apply the UI with Anemone however I didnt want the other UI elements only the passcode UI so I put it at the bottom of Anemone because no other themes that I had installed theme the passcode. That way all I get is the passcode UI because everything else is covered by the UI of the themes I placed above. Alternatively you can go into iFile or Filza and find the image files for the passcode UI and just delete everything else. Theyre not hard to find I did this at first but had to reinstall the theme for some reason and didnt get around to doing it again. Let me know if it works. ,iOSthemes,d6z9b5q,1,t5_2w997

If the update does come out and it doesnt change anything then worst case scenario you delete it from Cydia and use iFileFilza to remove it from the Themes folder and reinstall from Cydia and from then on all updates and other things would work fine TLDR  No serious problems will occur,iOSthemes,d7xpuhk,1,t5_2w997

Al Gore By all means marry. If you get a good wife youll be happy. If you get a bad one youll become a philosopher. Socrates Woman inspires us to great things and prevents us from achieving them. Mike Tyson I had some words with my wife and she had some paragraphs with me. Bill Clinton  Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight dinner soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays I go Fridays.  George W. Bush I dont worry about terrorism. I was married for two years. Rudy Giuliani Theres a way of transferring funds that is even faster than electronic banking. Its called marriage. Michael Jordan Two secrets to keep your marriage brimming. Whenever youre wrong admit it.. Whenever youre right shut up. Shaquille ONeal The most effective way to remember your wifes birthday is to forget it once.. Kobe BryantYou know what I did before I married?? Anything I wanted to. David HasselhoffMy wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met. Alec Baldwin A good wife always forgives her husband when shes wrong. Barack ObamaWhen you are in love Wonders happen.But once you get married You wonder what happened. Philosophy of marriage At the beginningevery wife treats her husband as GOD..Latersomehow dont know why..alphabets get reversed..

Imgur LockPlus Creator edit menus These are themes I made a couple days ago but I can easily edit or delete it.I dont understand the login from PC. You cannot login from PC at all this has been gone for awhile and isnt coming back. Also the only login you have is SuperSecret repo which is only for the repo.The hover over the font is needed I will work on adding that. Thanks for the feedback.,iOSthemes,dg8197g,1,t5_2w997

11618819,0,t3_65t42n,Im not a designer so I dont know what the transitional animation could be but if someone does and wants to make this that would be awesome. It could also just constantly flip between the two while the fingerprint is on the scanner. I think this is possible because you can have custom glyphs and probably animations. If its a lot of work let me know how much  would get you to do it. In case youre wondering that is a cartoon of Skrillex an EDM producerDJrecord label ownerTHANK YOU!!!,iOSthemes,dgd05ck,1,t5_2w997

11739180,0,t3_67fspq,I love it so far. My only suggestion would be to reduce the colored glareshadow on the glyphs just a bit so its more subtle. Currently some of the glyphs bleed into the background which looks a little off it might like worse with my suggestion but I think it might be worth experimenting with. ,iOSthemes,dgqnzj9,2,t5_2w997
