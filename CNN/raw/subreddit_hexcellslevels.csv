Sometimes when Im in the middle of a particular theme I want to playtest it just to see where it leads but would like to be able to backtrack as if I never took that path. I know you can click the cells to cover them again but it isnt practical when youve made dozens of moves all over the puzzle and cant remember which ones were clicked or in which order.,hexcellslevels,csze9pu,1,t5_33n5p
4551668,0,t1_ct42d8y,Thanks for playing.gt Fourth puzzle I disagree with. Once you remove all intersections between clues youre trivially left with all clues instantly completable and hence the solution. This puzzle is therefore practically a pure observation puzzle.Keep in mind these puzzles represent a book version the video game. If you saw that particular puzzle in a book it wouldnt be as easy to solve because you dont have the convenience of removing the empty cells nor using the guide lines especially combinations of guidelines. Because all the clues are on the surface you can increase the difficulty by not clicking the empty cells. At the same time this particular puzzle was more about exploring the theme than focusing on its difficulty. gt you may as well show that each row and column has exactly one blue cell by using numbers instead of forcing people to read the text this also makes the puzzle more aesthetically pleasing.I agree but I wanted to be clear about what the theme was. Its not likely the player would have noticed if there was no text about it. By using numbers around the grid it could be easily ascertained that all the blues were on unique columns or diagonals but not necessarily make the connection that they were also on unique rows.Also sometimes the instructions are part of the puzzle. By revealing upfront that all blues were on unique rows columns and diagonals the player can now approach the puzzle much differently and with fewer clue numbers than otherwise.gt it IS possible to start clicking before youve fully solved the puzzle in your mind.Thanks for spotting that. Ive updated it to make it a little more difficult.,hexcellslevels,ct4cztt,1,t5_33n5p
