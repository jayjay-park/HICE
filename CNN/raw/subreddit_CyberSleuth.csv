6480303,0,t3_44drcf,What is the cap for max stats? Thx ,CyberSleuth,czpm0dh,1,t5_3caqh
6483098,0,t3_44dg5a,The effect of increasing ABI and level cap is the same regardless of which you do. If you have access to any other next forms digivolve to those so u can immediately dedigivolve back to the previous form i just did this with demidevimon he was caped one level short of digivolving to Devimon so i digivolved him to Bakumon then immediately dedigivolved him it didnt take him long to reach lvl  on the farm. If you dedigivolve first then u have to relevel up that weaker one just to get back to the form you had previously.,CyberSleuth,czpwfii,1,t5_3caqh

6605759,0,t1_d021o6x,Not sure but I my hpint durable Lilithmon has been oneshotted once by a different monster. Never encountered an Ulforceveedramon who tried to snipe my Lilithmon away but Im pretty sure she can survive other Lilithmons Phantom Pain unless they build a pure int one.,CyberSleuth,d02l9rl,1,t5_3caqh

6630989,0,t3_45fu1a,Or you could just develop them in your digi farm using all ultimate and above digimon with the builder personality and developer know hows all in the farm goods. Then check the  option and just keep doing that.,CyberSleuth,d0579g2,1,t5_3caqh
6633137,0,t3_46ikt2,Um. Spoiler tag maybe? ,CyberSleuth,d05f9gd,2,t5_3caqh
6652062,0,t3_46peif,Ulforceveedramon is a must. Always moving first gives a huge advantage. Sakuyamon is really good since she can cancel out all of every enemies buffs at once.Have a digimon with every status inducer to test which one is effective against each knight. Most of them are immune to all but  status and that status is usually the key to beating them.Damage piercers Wargreymon Plesiomon Lillithmon Belphemon RM to just do huge damage.Mastemon or Wisemon preferably Mastemon since she does  more damage and has higher stats do a ton of damage to Examon for  of the battle.Get Jesmon as soon as you can. His damage nullification is required for Imperialdramon PM.And just about every knight is vulnerable to bug.,CyberSleuth,d07dpts,3,t5_3caqh

6767211,0,t1_d0j84y1,The solution I found was actually from one of the Destiny forums. I also read that this was something common to CoD EA and Ubisoft games.,CyberSleuth,d0jcd8k,2,t5_3caqh
6775460,0,t1_d0k8rgz,Think I only needed  case since this one I just found fills in a conveniently empty space on the board. Also gives me the last memory I need to hit . No clue why some missions get removed from the board. Would be so much easier to keep track of this stuff if everything stayed up and farm missions had their own board.,CyberSleuth,d0ka5lg,1,t5_3caqh
6808114,0,t1_d0ntpy0,Hi there are  master barriers for each gameplay i use  on lilthmon and  on imperialdramon PM. For Ulforce i am giving him speed attach A unless i go for the new game play to get more master barriers.As for the other  slotters it will be either panic dx sleep dx and either dot or bug dx depending on whether they are healer or attackers.Cheers!,CyberSleuth,d0nzv8v,1,t5_3caqh
6833943,0,t3_49avcz,Im actually super stoked. I honestly hope these Digimon are both A good and B not just strict upgrades over their nonBurst Mode forms.Like Imperialdramon DM FM and PM. Each one is unique and none are just strict upgrades over each other.Beelzemon and Beelzemon BM on the other hand is the bad way of doing it where BM does everything regular Beelzemon does but better with the exception of Beelzemons support skill...and its unfortunately not very good even if it is unique.,CyberSleuth,d0qxfzn,5,t5_3caqh
6835029,0,t1_d0r1ahl,I played a bit of ORAS last night. Felt....lacking. Ill likely get SunMoon when it comes out  but Cyber Sleuth has definitely raised the bar for monster collecting games.,CyberSleuth,d0r1vy6,11,t5_3caqh
6884236,0,t3_4a1884,In addition to what others have said about DeDigivolvoving if you can make it to Ch. without much grinding by simply regularly using  Platinum SukaNumemon to finish fights particularly bosses repeat the Legendary Cup in Broadway F for Tactician amp Billionaire USBs. Thisll help you out leaps and bounds in building the best Digimon.Beat round  of the Legendary Cup and purposely lose in the round afterward. Dont carry any other spare Digimon because the AI likes to buff a LOT and it takes forever for them to finally attack and KO your team. Theres no penalty for losing and you keep all drops. WarGreymon is great to begin with here because Acceleration Boost  Great Tornado does huge damage even if it is resisted.Once youve finally got  Tactician USBs equip a set of  USBs to three PlatinumNumemon each Digivolved from BlackKingNumemon. This is done so they will have an actual decent attack Nightmare III. Have a Rookie level Freetype in your team so you can Function Call Lv. to force a fights in the most easily accessible dungeon available at Ch. beating around the bush to avoid any implications of spoilers. Go to a city whenever you reach an appropriate level to access the DigiLab and get back to grinding in the dungeon. Youll find yourself earning  exp per fight.,CyberSleuth,d0wn7pw,2,t5_3caqh
6995093,0,t1_d198ggu,Its just...there are no down sides to keeping this on. I dont know unless there is something else that buffs up stats? The things Ive seen only buff up EXP bootssearchesrare builds.,CyberSleuth,d198j8o,1,t5_3caqh
