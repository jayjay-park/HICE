10634046,0,t3_5s58is,Im running a party of BradNernClintGarth right now and Im having a lot of success. The combination of Brad and Clints knockdowns keep many enemies from attacking making up for Clints low HP and they both hit SUPER hard thanks to Garths attack boosts. Clint does have some SP troubles though but Nern helps to alleviate that as well. Hes certainly not a weak party member he just needs the right team to shine imo.,lisathepainfulrpg,ddctk9v,1,t5_391a5

11225890,0,t1_df4f16p,Yep I was going for straps! Glad they worked out.Oh and his gang? Its just him with the gasmask. His gang doesnt have a name yet Im not really sure what to call them.They arent that huge in numbers but they have some decent equipment and are more focused on guns. They are also a tad different from your typical Olathe gang as they are antiJoy. They dont believe you should use drugs to make yourself feel better. They sound good when I put it like that but they arent that nice. They still kill a lot and steal from people. They also are aware of Joys mutation effect so they slaughter people who are addicted to Joy as a way to kill them while they are weaker and not mutated.And btw the blood on Porkys mask is actually just red paint. And he secretly has a Joy addiction despite his gangs beliefs.Oh and thats all before the Painfuls events. For a while they stayed mostly in the same area terrorizing local communities and travelers passing through. But when Buddy was discovered and word got out that a girl exists the gang decided to jump on the bandwagon and search for her so they began traveling to other parts of Olathe.They had a lot of rough times during their travels and they lost a lot of people as some of their members were closet Joy addicts and ended up mutating. Towards the end everyone in the gang either left or died. Porky the last remaining member of his gang is still alive and has kicked the Joy addiction. After that he disappeared and the rest of his story is a mystery. Probably died at the end of Joyful like everyone else or became a Joy mutant from his past addiction or something.,lisathepainfulrpg,df4fv67,2,t5_391a5
