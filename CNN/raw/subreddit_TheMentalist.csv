85877,0,t3_1v2qyp,WTF is he saying to people?edit I just realized the episode aired an hour later here. That was an unexpected ending. ,TheMentalist,ceo7fdo,4,t5_2rqpe
88386,0,t1_ceoerzm,Seriously my first thought upon seeing the ending is  theres no way they are going to off both of them are they?I mean its certainly possible because remember that Grace isnt the babies birth mother. So its certainly possible they could kill them both and the baby goes back to the assistant DA mommy and thus off the show,TheMentalist,ceohpjm,3,t5_2rqpe
93209,0,t1_ceokop7,Maybe because hed somewhat abandoned it? He didnt seem to have a permanent residence. He slept in the CBI building. Justifiable as a flight risk.,TheMentalist,cep1ig1,1,t5_2rqpe
237748,0,t3_1wrvzp,Yea i have re watched every episode an ebaressing amouny of times and theres so many subtle clues i cannot believe they were for no reason. The writers are great and are gonna leave us in awe not aww,TheMentalist,cf5e5a1,1,t5_2rqpe
279858,0,t3_1xb41c,Try the american version of Sherlock Holmes Elementary its on CBS to like the Mentalist.  Sherlock Holmes is a very old character first made famous by the famous short stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle when i first saw the Mentalist Jane reminded me of Sherlock Holmes.  ,TheMentalist,cf9rqb3,5,t5_2rqpe
336375,0,t1_cfez4my,Or did we? Her sister looked just like her and we know red john has kept bodies on ice for many many years.Also the scene when jane sees her body there was a giant poster of a woman with the word ALIVE written on it . The camera purposively looked at it .Plus patrick hardly showed any emotion or checked the crime scene .Also lorelie had a gunshot wound on her right arm that was fresh in the video she shot but her dead body did not show it...Check it out pretty crazy right ?,TheMentalist,cffmvyz,1,t5_2rqpe

1038030,0,t1_chlg7wu,Really? I mean I like the Jisbon scenario as much as anyone else but I didnt like the way they did it too cliche and not smart at all like every single person happened to get that fucking clue? ok... So Jane cant get through the TSA but he can just walk out to the back of the airport hop a fence and charge to an airplane like its nothing? and then dont get me fucking started on the god damn air hostess just opening the fucking door like its not a big deal and being like yes strange man running through the airport what can I help you with?Idk I just felt betrayed because even though the show has always been over the top I feel like they over did it this time.,TheMentalist,chma1u4,8,t5_2rqpe

1055846,0,t3_266xes,JimH is right anything is possible.However I have to say that the article suggests that renewal beyond this is not likely.Maybe the way to look at it is to think we are lucky to have got another  episodes out of it when everyone thought it was going to be cancelled.,TheMentalist,choayu7,2,t5_2rqpe
1056103,0,t1_choby6i,Well if it had not been in this subreddit which I had been following I would not have even given it a second thought.But the community feel here meant I followed the thread and other people also asked the guy to say what he meant clearly.Obviously we know that Heller himself said the RJ story was concluded but yeah in general people in this sub have given the disbelievers a bit of free space at least to express themselves...,TheMentalist,choc0pl,2,t5_2rqpe
1185562,0,t1_ci2y8gy,You didnt realize that every clue fell right into janes lap? U need to re watch the eps jane sat back as clue after clue moved him to the Ba. Most important clue of them all was the tattoo clue  rj left her alive to tell him that one too. ,TheMentalist,ci2ztct,0,t5_2rqpe
1417735,0,t3_2ab5oy,Just finished season  and I have to say that I love the addition of the FBI team to the cast. I like the personality of Fischer and Abbott. Wiley fits nicely in but I dont like him that much. The episodes are overall well written.Im VERY happy that the whole Red John thing is over. God that was starting to get extremely tedious weve literally been hunting him for  seasons now. I really dont like when great shows has extremely long story arcs it just doesnt feel right to me. I like the individual episodes with investigation and the usual Jane tricks. Overall I think it was good Hyped for season !,TheMentalist,citzpgu,3,t5_2rqpe

2831830,0,t3_2sjazv,The new season is good in my opinion.  But then I had seen enough of RJ.If there is a major plot it is the relationship between Jane and Lisbon it seems to me.,TheMentalist,cnpz332,18,t5_2rqpe
2917860,0,t3_2sjazv,This is the best season yet for me. Maybe its just the fact thats its going to be over soon but I adore the weekly stories and the development of Jisbon. Gonna be over way too soon  Screw a big plot this is how it should be. Red John went on for way too long anyway.,TheMentalist,cnzroyl,1,t5_2rqpe

3187492,0,t3_2wl9mi,I wonder if they actually planned out the ending for them two too eventually fall in love and get married that early in the show. Doubt it because red John was chosen so late lol,TheMentalist,cosdtpw,1,t5_2rqpe
