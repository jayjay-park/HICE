486980,0,t1_cfvjhqu,I was at GVSU for at least two years before I noticed it wasnt named after the Standale shopping district. The only thing that tipped me off was seeing this same store namelogo in a different location and realizing it was part of a larger company.,GVSU,cfvmg6i,1,t5_2s34a

851247,0,t3_23vhto,Before you appeal Id do two things  Talk to the prof and ask how your grade was calculated. Insist on specifics. It sounds like youre doing this already.  If that doesnt satisfy you talk to the department chair and present what you know and what you talked about with the prof and ask for the chairs opinion especially about your chances with an appeal. The chair should be open to discussing this with you. But youd need to act pretty soon as summer break is approaching. BTW I do not speak officially for GVSU despite the fact I am faculty. This is just one persons opinion. ,GVSU,ch11i0u,6,t5_2s34a

7541404,0,t3_4in2id,Courses that have received the SWS designation are not merely courses that require written assignments they adhere to certain guidelines. At least four hours of class time are devoted to writing instruction. Students turn in a total of at least  words of writing during the term. Part of that total may be essay exams but a substantial amount of it is made up of finished essays or reports or research papers. The instructor works with the students on revising drafts of their papers rather than simply grading the finished piece of writing. For a threecredit course at least one third of the final grade is based upon the writing assignments.  from   They are essentially courses with heavier emphasis on developing your writing skills in the particular subject. Ive taken ? I think in my  years here so far but Im a history major and many history classes are SWS.,GVSU,d2zf6ds,1,t5_2s34a
