5343801,0,t3_3o7dc9,I tried to trade Childress for Conklin before lockout but apparently I was too late so Im stuck with him captain. This does give me double Khazzouh though so could be worse.Think Im on . ,nbl,cvuqamb,2,t5_2vfat
5515469,0,t1_cwgkb7n,The league was very strong at that point. I mean the Tigers had Gaze Copeland and Bradtke and they still lost to the Magic.,nbl,cwgngo4,1,t5_2vfat

9581876,0,t1_d9u3mdq,Yeah thats one hell of a road trip with only a day off. Youd think theyd play in Perth and Adelaide as a double.,nbl,d9u5u66,2,t5_2vfat
10341521,0,t1_dcg9mj6,I was at the game sitting in the South Mezzanine thinking Christ well blow this in OT wont we... and then Ibekwe hits that buzzer beater. With no replay in the building we were all convinced it was on time and good lucky it was haha.Hopefully soon enough therell be another great Breakers moment like this one.,nbl,dcg9qsx,6,t5_2vfat
10709259,0,t3_5t5rl2,What a game to watch! I hated seeing Whittington walk off like that but the refs made the right call under those circumstances. Great to see Perth fire up when you let Prather and Cotton fire up together they can absolutely bury you.Bring on Melbourne next should be a hell of a contest!,nbl,ddkkvs3,3,t5_2vfat
10721685,0,t1_ddluhpj,I feel like we can take the win. Coming off a huge win and going into a game that the boys know they need to win will really help. That and the fact that United are out and have nothing to play for might impact how they play.,nbl,ddlv294,1,t5_2vfat

11719357,0,t1_dgn0ca9,While I respect your opinions I personally think that Gleeson is a great coach. Dont get me wrong Bevo is a fantastic coach but I dont think you can undercut Gleesons work. Lisch and Bevo may of departed but we saw the introduction of amazing players like Ennis Prather Beal McKay and Cotton.,nbl,dgof1rh,3,t5_2vfat
