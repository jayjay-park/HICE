5897709,0,t3_3vyg0j,Every time I wear a diver to the beach silt gets under the bezel. Youll feel a gritty feel when turning and it may even lock up. The silt can be removed while running fresh tap water and turning the bezel. Honestly this is too much trouble for me anymore so if I plan on going good into the ocean I wear a digital or just leave the watch off. I would expect this to be worse in mud conditions. If you want a diver you can look for one with an internal rotating bezel.,JapaneseWatches,cxsq1wz,3,t5_2x617

6482212,0,t1_czpsxvw,gt Australia. And unfortunately half the stuff i look at on Amazon doesnt ship to aus. Plus my budget is more around aud. I will have a glance at anazon though on the odd chance they might ship to me once in a blue moon.Ah okay. Some ecodrive diver options exist here within that budget unless you insist on an automatic I think that outside of the Signature line that NY is pretty much the only affordable Citizen dive watch with a classic look.,JapaneseWatches,czpt4xz,1,t5_2x617

It could also use a new crystal and button key that attached to the deployment buckle. I also need to make sure i can straighten out the watch band as it has some bends in it.Damn spelling it all out makes me think its a lost cause.,JapaneseWatches,d0zdsew,1,t5_2x617

7041146,0,t1_d1djtkb,Uhh.... not really...?For source just the first person that said they were selling one through eBay. They were located in the Philippines. For cost lets just say more than what the SRPs are averaging right now which is . In other words I overpaid because I wanted to be among the first to own one. New models usually come out costing at or near MSRP and gradually drop over time. I will assume that the SRP and SRP will follow the same trend as do all of Seikos models. For instance the Prospex Monsters like the SRP that came out last year were originally selling in the  range. You can pick those up for about .Normally I wait it out like most sane people do and purchase them cheaper. The last time I bought a watch right after its initial release was my SRPJ I overpaid then as well. ,JapaneseWatches,d1egyor,0,t5_2x617

Ill probably be ordering parts for my next one soon.Its not too difficult if youve done fiddly things with your hands before. If building a metal earth model seems within your grasp youll have no problem modding a watch. Just make sure you have decent tools. I got a starter watch repair kit from Amazon for about  and it was finealthough the hand removal tool which is what I bought it for was total crap. ,JapaneseWatches,d290t0l,2,t5_2x617

7986990,0,t1_d4dsw5k,Buyers should not be expected to become experts before buying old watches. That state of affairs only exists because people made these parts so they could trick buyers. And yes there are old watches with perfect dials they still exist! Even if the seller acknowledges the AMcounterfeit parts I have yet to see one acknowledge that they are of inferior quality. Have you compared your  with one with original parts?Its definitely illegal to print watch dials with someone elses trademark on the dial. Rolex buyers would never stand for it and Seiko buyers shouldnt either. I have no problem with aftermarket parts created with no intent to deceive clearly identifiable but I believe they are a small fraction of what is created.,JapaneseWatches,d4dtayv,2,t5_2x617

8825828,0,t1_d78qbt2,What he said. I relume these pretty often for customers and can always get a good result on a genuine looking result. Heres one I did this week.I know the dial isnt straight ive just put it under glass to check the appearance as the optical difference because of the curved glass can make a difference.Ive also cleaned the scale off the markers.The hands were treated in a light acid to remove the scale and have also been relumed the same lume shade. I dont have those out to photograph right now though. That turns the hands from a  to an .Id recommend a GOOD lume job on these as its a huge aesthetic improvement over old moldy lume.Done well I dont think it affects the value of the watch.As for the crowns they are around but if the gasket is hard Spencer or myself can change the gasket and repack it with a long life viton gasket for you.,JapaneseWatches,d78qqhb,4,t5_2x617

11018837,0,t3_5xcej8,PicsHey all Im trying to help my dad sell some of his classic watches and I figured Id start with this beautiful Seiko Lasalle first. Model  Serial DFace mmBand .Made in Japan . conditionThis watch has absolutely no visible scratches on it and is in FULLY working condition. I literally just had a new battery put into it this morning  so its ready to go. The back of the watch even still has the plastic film on it. As you can see from the pictures both the watch and case are in excellent shape. I dont know the exact year of this watch but my dad said he purchased it brand new back in  and has probably worn it a total of  times. Originally priced at  back in the day you could say that this was one of Seikos attempts to redefine themselves as a luxury watch maker.
