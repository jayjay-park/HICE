426838,0,t3_1ynb8v,Bad week for me so farend of last week.  Long story short Ive been drinking a lot less trying to improve my life ended up leaving a party early to stay away from drinking more and got a DWI blew a .... in my driveway.  The story is long and I obviously dont feel that justice was served so Im hiring an attorney.I probably shouldnt even have legally said as much as I just did on the internet.  Im not going to hide from this like I want to.  Im just being honest with you guys.I feel really terrible all around right now and am going to speak to an adviser of mine tomorrow about going to therapy...  not that Im in a bad place but I can feel myself slipping.  Ive been there before and do not want to go back...I also did not workout last week.  Cant stop thinking about that either.  I said I would work out  day and failed to do it.I know I have to forgive myself and writing this is a start.  I just want to be a better person tomorrow than I was today.  That is going to be one of my goals from now on.,GroupImprovement,cfp09hd,3,t5_2z42i
