Naturally or darker complexed  or less. SPF is the number of minutes it takes you before you will start to burn if you are in the sun.

Youll go just as fast with breath stroke as you would with bad front crawl and breath stroke is not as tiring. Also assuming you cant do flip turns try not to waste time in betweens laps.

4142614,0,t3_37l34i,Ok here is my biggest piece of advice blow your whistle first then enter. If your afraid of looking like and idiot for jumping into the water and pulling up a kid who you find out was holding his breath for a while dont be it shows you are effectively scanning and identifying problems. Last week I had an elderly man face up half under the lane line half in the free swim area not moving and no chest rise. I yelled Blew my whistle one then after that he did not respond so I activated my EAP. When I got to the patron he jumped up keep in mind the alarm is sounding and said he had double hearing aids. My staff congratulated me and next in service we talked about why it was good I entered the water.,Lifeguards,crsh4hm,1,t5_2sjy6

4385510,0,t3_3b7b3q,You could do circle of death for CPR? Put a dummy in the middle of the circle and have  responders and if one person messes up the next person goes in.I dont know how big your pool is so this might not work but something that my pool does is have everyone who is on break be outside on the bench responding to rescues if there are any. Anyways for one inservice we had a bunch of people go up to their positions and then had everyone else responding. Then a manager would walk around and tell the people at positions to do different whistles and when so like the people on the bench would have to distinguish between a yelling at a kid whistle and a spinal whistle and know if they have to respond so then the responders would come running with the backboard and crash bag as fast as they could. That really helped with our response time and whistles so it was pretty fun.Or you could just do full scenarios and have a bunch of people playing while everyone else is responding or guarding. When you do an unconscious scenario replace the person with a dummy and go from there add in obstacles like obstructed airway while theyre doing it too. That runs through a lot of the material.,Lifeguards,csjzf0e,1,t5_2sjy6

7134202,0,t3_4d9sox,Whereabouts in Australia will you be heading to? This is the official answer from the FAQ section of the Royal Lifesaving Society AUS Website You can gain some skills recognition but will still need to do some training in the Australian Industry Standards for areas such as Aquatic Rescues CPR Defibrillation Spinal Management and Communication. Once you know where you will be located contact your nearest Royal Life Saving Office for more information on training courses.Check this for your equivalent qualifications. Each of the states has a different branch of the Royal Life Saving Society so as soon as you know which state youre headed to contact them. In general lifeguard base pay at a public pool at least in Western Australia is more than AUD excluding bonuses on weekends and public holidays.  different shifts a day approximately  hours each shift. ,Lifeguards,d1p2w1o,2,t5_2sjy6

10032882,0,t1_dbeetrw,I would be very careful about this. Im not a lawyer but I would be surprised if the pools insurance covers death due to negligence not saying this was the case I dont have all the details but a good lawyer can certainly make it seem that way. Also I havent worked at a pool in a while and I would imagine this law varies by statecountry but im pretty sure good Samaritan laws dont protect onduty lifeguards. Lifeguards are trained professionals who have a legal duty to rescue and provide emergency aid to those in need. I would consider contacting a lawyer just to cover all your bases.,Lifeguards,dbfb7me,2,t5_2sjy6

11230492,0,t3_5zjycl,Fellow Lifesaving InstructorExaminer here. Best way is to contact the Lifesaving Society and ask them. You can find your branch contact info here I also want to add According to the Lifesaving Program Policy the minimum Candidate to Instructor ratio for Lifesaving programs e.g. Canadian Swim Patrol and Bronze is . Approval must be received for coursesRecerts with only  candidates before the start of the program.  Classes with only  candidate will not be approved in order to ensure program quality and transparency.The Branch has developed a Lifesaving Program Exception Form that allows Instructors to conduct a class with as few as  candidates and as many as  without prior Branch approval provided that the criteria listed on the form is met.
