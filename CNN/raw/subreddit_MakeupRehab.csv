1451726,0,t1_ciy8uns,My most favourite ones ever Arcana Astrids Diadem  TMTM Aurora. Astrids is already so nice and smooth and cozy and then the added chocolate from Aurora just... so much yes.  Arcana Little Man in the Boat  Arcana Erzulies Soft Kiss  Haus of Gloi old Peach Mama. They all share either peach or honey notes so they tie in really well. Smelling like rain would be awesome! I have a sample of Haus of Glois Rain note but it is a very warm aquatic with none of that slight chill than rain tends to bring or the coolness of the water itself. ,MakeupRehab,ciy8zer,1,t5_32g1x

1703999,0,t3_2dtjue,I have four orange things Id like to get rid of and my reasons for wanting them out of my collection are as followedE.L.F. Lip Balm Tint in Peach Top swatch Nice amount of colour but works more as tint than as a moisturizing balm which when you have dry lips is a little disappointing! Id like to get into making my own lip balm as well to save money so Im no longer interested in having balms in my collection. Will be finishing.Sephora Collection Rouge Infusion Lip Stain in Orange Elixir Again the swatch is pretty and has a nice amount of colour but I cannot in good conscious recommend these to anybody. This is absolutely not a stain and wears away in  minutes bleeds out of your lip lines and makes you look crazy! To kick you while youre down they taste and smell odd. Currently using as a light wash of colour on the cheeks underneath a powder blush. Will be attempting to finish.MAC Sheertone Blush in Peaches Unfortunately nothing wrong with this blush except for the fact that its fairly dupable in colour. I do appreciate that it is matte but find that for the price I dont mind switching to a much cheaper colour with a small amount of sheen. If Im going to be paying mac blush prices in the future I would go for something more unique and only found at that price point. Will be finishing.Amazonian  HR Clay Blush in Tipsy More coraly. My first problem with this is its  hour claim. Doesnt last more than  on me  Second it somehow looks exactly like my natural redness so it makes me look incredibly ruddy. Will be trading or giving away.  Did you have more or less orange than you thought you had?Definitely more. I didnt realise I had so much in my to pan areas. However as Im warmtoned corals and oranges are easy and usually a safe bet for me so Im not too surprised. Are there any products you feel are too similar?Not really. I think I consciously buy different types of textures and products so that Im covered in all situations change of seasons on the go etc. If you had to pick one to keep out of all of them which would it be?MAC Peaches blush because its the only product I dont actively dislike or am meh about. Its sheer making it perfect for lazy day washes of healthy colour but also pretty buildable. Its a colour that I love on my skintone and I plan on using a shade just like it but hopefully for much cheaper for years to come!,MakeupRehab,cjty8x6,3,t5_32g1x
1713534,0,t3_2e13h2,I recently redid my storage situation to go to school and it helped me cut down my collection. I got a train case from Yazmo wih a  off coupon and free shipping inside the US. What I liked about is one is it locks so it made me feel more secure about having makeup in a dorm wih my randomly assigned roomie. Its travel friendly by car but not so much by plane if you have liquid products. When I go by air travel I usually have two makeup bags in my checked luggage. Ideally my set up involves Muji drawers or a gorgeous Ikea Alexa but it will be a while before I have the space or budget to have a set up like that. ,MakeupRehab,cjv5iww,2,t5_32g1x

1991160,0,t3_2helk0,i totally and wholeheartedly understand where youre coming from. i used to be significantly overweight still am but its a slow and steady journey and found that i would buy makeup because i couldnt find cute clothes that flattered my body  didnt have the confidence to go out as often because of my weight. im not really sure what your situation is but i think understanding why you make your purchases and when are you hungry? bored? stressed? lonely? youre must susceptible to  buying new things is really important. i think i saw your post on rmakeupaddiction with depotting all your makeup which is a great start! sad to say but for me i needed to take a break from mua unsubscribe from beauty emails and take a break from youtube before really committing to whittling down my collection and keeping my spending in check. what helped me the most was writing down my goals for the next  months. i want to travel to see my family go white water rafting and buy a new car way more than i want more makeup. writing down exactly what i want a timeline for how long it will take and accountable steps that i need to take to get to my goals have distracted me from constantly accumulating more things. personally id skip the weightloss clinic personally myfitnesspal and rloseit gave me the tools that i needed to work on my weight loss. id use that budgeted money to get a gym membership and invest in some great ingredients to make yummy food. youve done a great job admitting you want to change so now you have to want that change more than you want to stay how you are! ,MakeupRehab,ckt4vf9,2,t5_32g1x

2026286,0,t3_2hzck2,Im really trying to live more minimalistic so I apply it to every part of my life including makeup and clothing. My goal is to have a select few favourites that I can love and use up before they go bad. I dont want my money wasted in products just laying around! I have some criteria If its a cream product and its over  years old it gets tossed.  Anything that has changed smell consistency or performane gets tossed.  If I dont remember the last time I used it it gets tossed or donated. I swatch and compare similar products and get rid of the ones I dont like as much as the other. Im only one person I want to be able to use my products up before they go bad! If I really cant part with something I make sure to use it the coming weeks and see what I think about it. If I dont like it I have to get rid of it.  I also research how other people use products I havent been able to make work for myself just in case Im missing something obvious. I have limited space and drawers to keep my makeup in. If they start overflowing I know its time for a new round of decluttering. I would never buy more drawers because I know myself I would just fill them up as well! I participate in Project  Pan! Of course  Taking pictures and making a game out of using products up is fun and addicting! I do a makeup inventory every couple of months and compare my notes from last time. Do I really need this many cream eye shadows? I never wear them! So I know not to buy any more until I use a few up. Watching decluttering videos on youtube is addicting and gives a new perspective!

Buxom eyeliner in topaz |  | Only used it a few times this week its difficult to use without looking tired  . Perfume sample |  | Splashed some of this into a foot bath and the results were awesome. Going to do that again this week to finish it off.. Josie Maran lipcheek tint in Cha Cha | ?? | I cant tell progress on this at all. Also using it with the lip gloss makes my lips more pigmented than I want. So I cant use those on the same days  . Josie Maran lip gloss |  | Been using it a lot. I feel like the other half of this didnt take that long to get through. Its probably just because Im monitoring it now.. Sugar Rose lip treatment |  | Im destroying this. I use it all the time at home especially when Im drinking water so I can keep reapplying. Its like cheating! Also this broke off and I had to jam it back in. Its way too soft.. Nyx nude on nude kit white shadow |  | The powder is pretty dense.. Nyx nude on nude kit light pink shadow |  | The remaining stuff is clinging to the sides and is difficult to get.. Nyx nude on nude kit dark pink shadow |  | Its trucking along.Need to work onThe buxom eyeliner  The eyeliner is awesome Im just not an eyeliner person and applying it often makes me look more tired or grungy than I want especially because I cant pick this up with a thin liner brush. Ideally Id want to use this in my lash line but the twist up product is too big around to do that.Josie Maran lipcheek stain  Theres nothing wrong with the product whatsoever Im just less interested in it.

I use this with the sugar frosting lip butter on top.Finished. bareMinerals Stroke of Light sample | I overestimated how much was remaining this stuff disappeared quickly. Finished it on Wednesday. . Garnier Fructis shampoo samplesized | I thought there was some remaining until today so I will just say it is done today.

What I have done is wait until the full box reveal and if its something I know I will totally use AND want I will buy it outright.  I bought the FitFabFun winter box bc it was cheaper than buying my face mask outright and came with other awesome products including a swank eye cream. I also bought the Sample Society Dec. box for the same reason.

3211146,0,t3_2wwltr,I like that you did this breakdown but I feel like you missed one aspect and misrepresented another.You missed that BB sends out coupons for their store ALL the time. Often times its take a percentage or some cash off right now I have one for  dollars off of  but another thing is almost all of them come with free shipping. Waiting to order full sized items when you have a coupon greatly increases the savings on their items.The part I felt you misrepresented was the reviews. You dont have to write a review to get points. You have to fill out a short survey that takes at max  minutes honestly I rarely take more than a minute per item. Half of the questions are optional and they even have an option to review it if youve not tried the product they ask about packaging and the brand if youve not tried it and little else.Also every year they do a sale for new customers or old customers with a new email address that is often very good last year it was  dollars for the year and  dollars worth of points meaning that if you review and spend your points you are actually getting the box for free.While I honestly think its cool that you broke it down I dont think that you gave them a fair shake as youve never used them so dont understand truly how things work with them. ,MakeupRehab,couu2no,9,t5_32g1x

3508413,0,t3_30g3aj,The Sephora Birthday Gift is pretty good this year so you have that to look forward to.  Shop your stash and think of ways to dupe that new Tarte palette? If you have plenty of makeup then you could have similiar stuff already. If so you dont need the new palette. ,MakeupRehab,cps6mul,3,t5_32g1x
3516192,0,t3_30i7cs,I have this problem with a couple foundations as well. I would mix the dark foundation with the lightest foundation I had and it still wouldnt match. Whats working for me is pairing my darker foundation with a lighter powder and powdering the center of the face so its like a natural highlight. Or I mixed in a white primer that I had and it sheered out the foundation and made it a touch lighter. ,MakeupRehab,cpt2lgd,2,t5_32g1x

3633518,0,t1_cq4nlpq,I saw you have a Bare Minerals foundation and mineral veil thats unused. I personally love Bare Minerals. The foundation powder is one of those items that even before I realized the MUA world I had always set aside money to buy it. If you end up having no interest in it Id definitely suggest selling it or doing a swap. If you do decide you want to try it and are just not sure how theres lots of YouTube videos that are more helpful that the DVD that comes with it. I will say that its a great summer foundation especially if you live somewhere where the weather gets really hot or humid and despite what some people say you can get full coverage from it. If all else fails the mineral veil alone is a great setting powder. Sorry Im just one of those people who have used powder foundations in almost every brand and Ive always come back to Bare Minerals but I get that powder foundation isnt everyones cup of tea.,MakeupRehab,cq6g5oj,1,t5_32g1x

3691205,0,t3_32o9qj,Ive noticed something odd over the past few days my eyeshadow has been fading and creasing faster on the left eye. On Sunday I wore a Stila shadow that creased after  hours on the left but looked perfect on the right eye for over  hours. Obviously I am using the same products and application method on both eyes so I dont know whats going on! I use MAC Painterly as a primer to both eyes starting with the left then the shadows starting with the left again. My best guess so far is that the primer doesnt get as much time to setget tacky on the left lid as the right. Anyone have any other ideas?,MakeupRehab,cqd0s26,2,t5_32g1x

I depotted my benefit high beam and its so much easier to get product now so Ive been flying through it haha. Im also close to finishing a foundation I probably have  weeks left. The only ones Im struggling with are my nars laguna and my cream blush. I use laguna at least x a week and I feel like theres not much progress.

3838784,0,t3_34e0cx,I started following rMakeupRehab last fall and did really well and adopted some much better habits.  Made an inventory had a major destash of productscolours that didnt suit me or Id never use and was regularly doing project pan and using up loads of products.  Then I took a trip to the US in March and broke my low buy horribly and this opened the flood gates back into bad buying behaviour.   I didnt realise how bad it had got until doing a new inventory and the number of palettes I owned more than doubled between January and April.  So..after spending a good week reading through posts amp making a plan Im now back on track.  Did another destash my most thorough yet and have a big tub of products to list on MUE.  I was brutal this time and included things I would eventually use but just have too much of and dont need making them overwhelming thank you konmari method! also done wonders for my closet.  Ive put myself on a full out no buy until October since low buys dont really work for me.  Ive also got two things I ordered that I didnt need ready to post back for returns which Ill do tomorrow.On the positive side Ive panned in the past two weeks a bunch of stuff Ive been working on for months including my winter moisturiser and first ever lipstick. Im really excited to hopefully get down over the next few months to my ideal collection which is just a couple of each type of product that I will use daily and love.,MakeupRehab,cqtus30,5,t5_32g1x

I hate the inconvenience of loose eyeshadows so I was ecstatic when I found out Blackbird was coming out with the pressed form. However I dont think they perform the same as they do when they are loose powders. I think they are harder to work with and dont last as long on the lids.

I really liked both as an option for lighter makeup days. For now Im going to hold off and keep using my Tarte Hour fullcoverage foundation with a lighter hand when I want that effect but I may put one on my Christmas list.This week has been good so far but still kind of stressful. The good my grad program paired me with a mentor whos a year ahead of me. I met her yesterday and shes great super helpful and nice. I found her advice really beneficial. The stressful stuff is just resulting from the fact that there are things about this experience that I did not anticipate of course thats life and now I have to figure out how to deal commuting in rush hour sucks more than I thought it would and my job is not working out.

5168890,0,t3_3lskmd,Wow ok hi again! I missed you guys last week  Back from week  of the Neverending Travel Saga aka The Professional Week. I discovered that my makeup needs change pretty seriously in ways I didnt expect when Im a moving around through the day and b interacting facetoface with people for long periods. I really regretted after a few days not having packed more longwear liquid lipsticks because averagelongevity lipsticks that are no problem to reapply once or twice a day at home became a big oh god I have a ring around my lips dont I deal after a few hours of meetings or a business lunch. Similarly the cream foundations that I love so much at home are just melting hell when Im trotting all over the city in  degree heat. Powder foundation would have been wiser. I have plenty of powder foundation and longwear lipsticks at home but home is  hours away and I have  more weeks of lessintense travel and a long weekend of businessmeetingintense travel ahead of me before I get back there. I really want to avoid buying doubles of anything I have at home because thats incredibly wasteful but for that business weekend I really dont want to be worrying about my lipstick or foundation during meetings. Its important to me that I look put together and competent. So I hit up CVS this week to try to find some cheaper options LOreal powder foundation Covergirl longlast lipsticks but Im not sure if those will work out and I kind of suspect Ill be landing at the local Sephora sometime soon trying to pick up the slack. In this particular case being comfortable and well puttogether is more valuable to me than the money it would cost me that would normally mess with my budget...but at the same time that cant be a license to just anxietyshop once Im in the Sephora either.,MakeupRehab,cv91i8b,3,t5_32g1x

5276375,0,t3_3n92f3,Hmm very good question. I think part of it is that were so trained to think we can buy our way out of thingsjust this one more product will make me happy talented attractive fit etc. And yeah its a lot easier to buy a new palette than perfect your eyeshadow technique. The same goes for a lot of hobbies. Its easier to buy some fun new pens and notebooks than to really work at your writing or drawing skills easier to buy new photo equipment than to figure out how to take better photos easier to buy colorful new running shoes than to do speedwork on the track.Part of the antidote is to dig down into what you truly hope to accomplish. If you really want to buy something ask yourself why and if you can achieve the same result with something you already have. Its part of why when listing out my ideal collection I tried to think about what I wanted the effects to be first rather than specific productsfor example even glowy skin before jumping into MAC BB cream and Becca highlighter.,MakeupRehab,cvm47vo,12,t5_32g1x

We went to a local parade and talked to people about the upcoming election. It was an awesome experience. I was afraid people would not want to talk to a stranger on the street but they were very receptive about discussing the issues that were important to them. And thats what it should be about regardless of who you vote for  people having a voice in the political process. Im excited to attend and potentially host more events.On a makeuprelated note I am really happy that I chose to focus on my Naked  palette. I had forgotten how much I love these colors! I did a quick smokey eye today and layered Nooner with my Tarte Exposed blush. I also used Bootycall from Naked  as a highlighter and really liked the way it turned out.

5311698,0,t3_3nqhna,Are you able to go to a store where you could test eyeshadow? Like any eyeshadow just to figure out whether you hate shimmer or hate a certain color type. It would go a long way to getting you the One Perfect Palette. I would strongly recommend choosing between the Lorac Pro  or  if you could be sure you dont hate half of it its got good selection can be neutral or colorful is half matte and half shimmer...its practically made to cover your bases in one minimalistic palette and on top of that is high quality which means youre less likely to become frustrated with its limitations and feel the need to replace it as you get better with eyeshadow. Its probably pricier than you were thinking but I think its a solid investment if you are satisfied with the colors and wanting to learn a range of eyeshadow techniques.If you keep an eye out you can score a  off prestige coupon a few times a year at Ulta which takes it down to  and there you can exchange it if you regret it for any reason.,MakeupRehab,cvqmqp2,4,t5_32g1x

Im not trying to disparage anyone as i myself tend to overspend on  products but if I think about an adult spending pattern its like  lipsticks that you use up to the last drop before buying anything new one foundation one powder etcquality but minimalist and nowhere near Rouge levels of spending.Also I buy too much why Im in this sub I buy highend eg YSL Chanel Tom Ford and I only barely hit VIB in the last month or so.

5791370,0,t3_3uhw7p,I mean I dunno how you guys are fainting at  being cheap even if temptalia said that a Guerlain lipstick was  or a palette was SIXTY THREE DOLLARS its still sixty three freaking whole dollars for a palette that if you count carefully you probably dont one hundred percent adore every single shade in that palette. Like you could live without some of the shades. Dont buy something just because it seems cheap. Would you have bought or considered it at retail price? Lots of things cost . And its not like you were ever going to finish an entire Mac shadow maybe in  years you could finish  pot assuming you had a lot of eyeshadow if you insist on counting the value by weight.If you really want the palette Id say to destash another palette with similar shades. And to count the shades in this mac palette that you personally are excited to try and absolutely cannot live without. Chances are its not that many.And idk how  is cheap thats like a hundred bucks in my currency to me on eyeshadow when I already have a lot just personally. I dont even know any midend palettes that cost more than . okay I lied UD I suppose I think that the value of these fat juicy MAC shadows here is like Starbucks coffee where they ask you if you want to upgrade for a dollar and then youre like yes ooh I won I got value but actually the company is the one who won cause you didnt really wantneed more coffee but you thought you had better value by paying more when actually it cost the company nothing to give you some more hot water and you spent more money than you intended to.Sorry its am but something like that.,MakeupRehab,cxez2xa,38,t5_32g1x

The samples are cheap but once you buy pans palettes and pressing supplies youve spent just as much as you would on a midrange palette especially if youre not in the US because TKB Trading charges a lot for international shipping. I do love them because of the unique colours and since Ive already bought pressing supplies Ill buy more in the future.

5870748,0,t3_3vnhcz,When I really started getting into makeup I had a similar outlook to a lot of young women which is basically that I need to collect everything and have every color of eyeshadowlipstick ever. I also bought a lot of things that were talked about on youtube without thinking about whether or not I would actually use each items they were just things that I felt I should own because they were popular. Eventually I  kind of settled down and realized that I dont wear bold looks so I should stop buying bold eye makeup. I also realized through trial and error that Im very cool toned and that certain colors just werent going to work on me. Eventually I ran out of space for my collection and I realized that I shouldnt own something if Im only going to wear it twice a year.Your idea of buying a couple of Sephora favorites sets sounds like what I would have wanted to do to cultivate my collection... Instead I just bought full sizes of items I wasnt really sure about because they were popular. I also probably would have bought more drugstore makeup rather than midrange items when I was trying to see what type of products that I like. I dont wear liquid foundation or BB cream but I bought two of them from Sephora because people always say to invest in items like foundation. Not really worth investing if you dont like the type of item though. So basically I wish I would have tried out colors and products more cheaply first whether through the drugstore or value sets and not bought into as much of the hype.,MakeupRehab,cxp6q0f,3,t5_32g1x

I found my first HG product by accident at the same time I was waffling over destashing a palette that wasnt working for me and it clicked that I wasnt enjoying half my makeup collection. That seemed like a terrible waste of money and space. My plan has been to shop my stash and only buy when Im totally out of a given product and put good research and thought into those purchases. To keep from getting too bored I change my daily look every month and play with variations on that look throughout the month. ,MakeupRehab,cxpm56n,3,t5_32g1x

I was super pumped and saving up for this palette since I heard it was going to be released but its quite a letdown given some shades are repeats as well.  Maybe just stick with the two Nakeds depending on what else is in your collection?  Awesome progress with the Naked !  I only have one full size UD shade with a noticeable dent in it.

Ive never been to the US nor do I have any family or friends there Im from Scandinavia but it seems like consumerism is rampant all over the world and the way media and ads work  promoting shopping and consumption as the answer to everything  sure doesnt help. And then the politicians are encouraging it in their talks because apparently household spending is the only way to keep the economy afloat or something. Urgh. gt.lt I wish we could create a society with a more healthy relationship with spending and where we arent so dependent on economic development and increases in GDP... Sorry maybe this got too political. ..I totally agree with you on the role of a hobby! There are so many more fulfilling things than just acquiring things. For me though shopping is more of a habit than a hobby which I hope makes it easier to break free from. The sad thing about some of the makeup and stuff I own is that theyve followed me though at least one move and some of the makeup is from when I studied abroad a few years ago.

6159375,0,t1_cypq5h6,Theyre multiples for mixing and backups. I have a backup of the Nars so I could get  off of it and not get only  off when I need a new bottle during the Sephora sale in April. I like to mix Nars Sheer Glow with Loreal Infallible and my shade changes throughout the year. Right now I mix Nars with Loreal  and  to get my perfect shade finish undertone and weight. Those specific Loreal foundations are almost done. Same thing for the Maybelline concealers. Theyre all for different times of the year. I took the stopper out of two of them a while ago theyre almost gone. I mix Nars RCC with the Sephora one. I needed something very slightly lighter than Custard for winter so I mix them. Ive found that mixing in the Sephora one makes it lighter in texture too so it never creases!About Ambient Lighting Powders I havent used Diffused Light yet. I bought it to set my foundation when its really cold and dry here. Its been too hot for that! I use the palette every time I do my makeup. I either sweep Incandescent Light or Radiant light over where I highlight but in a less concentrated area so my highlight looks less stark over matte foundation if that makes sense. I go through phases of using Dim Light all over but not recently. Its getting drier and the Tarte powder makes my face feel really dry and chalky when I first apply it so I havent been using a finishing powder on top of that! If you feel meh about the Fyrinnae finishing powder my guess if that every finishing powder would be the same. Im trying to phrase this for the right tone but finishing powders are so sheer and subtle that theyre not that much different from one another.Oh wow.

6169647,0,t1_cyqvpt1,!!! Haha xD I thought about it and frankly two palettes would easily cost the  I paid for viseart? They go on sale for  sometimes too. I destashed all my palettes except wnw comfort zone so Im left with just viseart so thats how I justified the cost. Im kind of speechless at how it blows other mattes out of the water and again I was talked into the viseart instead of KVD shadelight by other MUE members who had owned a ton of matte palettes. Viseart is apparently the only palette with matte white and peach that actually swatches as an opaque matte white and peach on dark skin. I think that in this case you really pay for what you get.  MaryLou is great and I got it for . new on eBay which I thought was reasonable. It is my only highlighter but I love it so much that Im lazily considering champagne pop thoughts on champagne pop?  The bridal spray works and the UD allnighter doesnt at all xD xD But bridal gives a dewy glowy look as well as keeping your makeup on with extra hold in comparison to the normal skindinavia.

6178169,0,t1_cyrrizv,You would need to mix green into your foundation to make it lean more olive not under it. Putting more green under it will highlight the difference in tones and probably make your foundation look super ashygray. With that in mind you need to think about ingredients and tones and how these primers would mix with your existing foundations.  silicone based with silicone based water based with water based cool leaning pink with green ? Sounds like it would go ashy warm leaning orange with green ? Ditto warm leaning yellow with green ?

6178426,0,t3_4060c7,Had a complete melt down last night over hospital bills. Feeling pretty discouraged with lifedepressed. This is when the spendies kick in so that sucks. I wore the UDxGWEN lipstick sample in Exgirlfriend I got with my palette yesterday. Its basically the same shade as the Dior lipstick I researched and swatched and all that. I might buy it when my nobuy is over in March if Ulta has them. I have a gift certificate so thatd be a nice use. I have to make a trip to Sephora this week to make a return. I got a  pack of perfume rollerballs for  to up my total into Free Sample of Guerlain Lipstick territory. The perfumes are alright but not something I want to wear.

I guess it doesnt matter you can just pick whichever one you like better anyway. PI dont own this shade but I own a different one called Bronzed Taupe. The formula is fantastic.

I also like the idea in theory of standardising education. But ... I did a  month Erasmus Mundus MA and I thought it was perfect. Two semesters  months each of classes then six months for an internship or field research what I did and writing the thesis. Because of Bologna the programme has to change to a two year format. This means there will be four semesters  and a summer to deal with. It will be more expensive presumably less intensive and harder to find an opportunity for that wonderful six month workandwrite period. Plus new graduates will finish at the same time as every other programme.

6309716,0,t1_cz6gwfw,Alright so for the oranges Im keeping Bloodberry and Bull Finch. Theyre similar base colors but Bloodberry is a tinted stain and Bull Finch is an opaque metallic lipstick. They look super different on so Im using that as justification. I do use both on a semiregular basis.Between Passionflower and Wicked Heart Im destashing both in favor of keeping Jaxx. Im keeping both Scratch and Lucy for now. I havent worn either yet and will destash them based on wear time. Ill probably end up keeping Lucy.For the browns Im keeping Door and Witchcraft. Maybe my photos make it hard to tell but Door is a tinted smokey purple and Witchcraft is a burgundy with turquoise sheen. For now I think theyre different enough to justify both. Well see how much I reach for Door in the next few months. I use Witchcraft way too often to destash it.I actually mislabeled. The second Cauldron Smoke is actually Fyrinnae Phantasma. Regardless Im destashing both. Theyre a black base with green metallic shift and a black base chockful of purple glitter respectively. I kept them around because they were odd colors but realistically I dont really like how watery the formula is and it tends to bleed even when I use a clear lip liner. One of Three has yet to be used but Ill keep it for now as its the best black lipstick Ive ever come across. If I dont find a way to use it in the next month however its being destashed too.Thank you for all your thoughts! lt,MakeupRehab,cz6ue70,3,t5_32g1x

Coastal Scents Revealed    These werent bad but I never used them.  TheBalm Nude Tude  Really pigmented and nice but I never used it.  Tarte Tartelette  I HATE the Tarte eyeshadow formula. Not pigmented hard to pick up on the brush hard to blend. Will never buy a Tarte eyeshadow again. Tarte Rainforest After Dark  Same as above. I wanted it for travel but I hated the formula of this.  Too Faced Chocolate Bar  The shades didnt look good on me for some reason. I liked the palette though. I dont think its that pigmented though.  Too Faced Natural Matte  Not pigmented enough hard to blend. Too Faced Natural Eye  I had the old cardboard packaging. I liked this and used the shades a lot but stopped using it after buying the Lorac Pro. Lorac Pro   I love the formula but I had trouble using the shades in this. I keep thinking about buying it again but its probably not a good idea.  Lorac Pro Matte  I hated this not as a good as the original Pro formula. Not pigmented chalky hard to blend.  Lorac Unzipped  I liked this a lot but never used it. I tend to reach for matte shades more and I dont use rosy shades that much. In summary nothing is good as my Lorac Pro.Palettes Ive kept Lorac Pro   This is definitely my favorite palette. I love the shades in this and its perfect for everyday.  UD Naked Basics  amp   I reach for the nd one more but I love both. I can use all the shades in both for an everyday look. For some reason I love the quality of the shadows in these MUCH better than the Naked line.  KVD Shade and Light Eye  I love the formula of these and I love matte eyeshadow. I wont need to buy another matte palette again.Clearly I have bought way too many palettes. Its good to see everything written out because I need to stop buying palettes. ,MakeupRehab,czbc7zx,2,t5_32g1x
6351917,0,t3_42mwor,What do you expect them to do that would justify  a palette? In what way are your  palettes not fulfilling your need for eyeshadow? Are they not pigmented or hard to blend or not in the colors that you want? I suspect with the amount of eyeshadow you currently own you already have everything that a Viseart palette will give you. Even if the quality is slightly better which I dont know that it is buying and using the Viseart will necessarily mean that youre using less of what you already own.,MakeupRehab,czbn522,3,t5_32g1x

I did pretty well but stocked up a bit on perfume and skincare... so this year its an all beauty minus hair care I have VERY short hair and have never in my life hoarded hair stuff nobuy.,MakeupRehab,czmjowq,3,t5_32g1x
6475005,0,t1_czp1mzt,Yes definitely! Ive only been taking photos this week and Im already learning a lot about where the tweaks need to go! My natural face today that Ive worn countless times looks undone behind glasses and I find my blush doesnt last long enough.

6483479,0,t3_44fzzx,Base  . Literally one foundation in liquid format.Face  . Finishing powder blush primer highlighter. I could probably forgo blush seeing as I only wear it  times a week.Lips   lipbalm  red lipstick. These are the only  things I actually use lipwise and even red lipstick is a  time a year event for me.Eyes  uhhh this is tricker. I probably only use  individual shades in my life so lets just go with  shades in varying colours of taupe bronze burgundy rose gold pink and purple. Plus  eye primer and  glitter glue.Is an eyebrow pencil included in eyes? If yes I also include one eyebrow product.So technically my entire makeup collection should be less than  items. Its probably double that due to all the eyeshadows I own ,MakeupRehab,czpxugw,2,t5_32g1x

This is my daily BB and the color is a better fit than the Laneige. I have  in use   backup.  Pacifica BB cream travel size. This was part of a gift set I got for Christmas. Its useful for traveling.  Tarte tinted treatment BB primer or whatever its called in light. I bought this to wear under a BB cushion for days when I want extra coverage and some pore smoothing. Its working really well for me using it like that.,MakeupRehab,czpz3j5,1,t5_32g1x
6483953,0,t3_44bvo7,OP here. Thank you everyone for your lovely advice. After I read your comments I ended up throwing out a lot more stuff that I was just holding on to which is excellent. I got into makeup right around the time I discovered youtube makeup tutorials and subconsciously thought that a room full of makeup was what it took to look like them not realizing they are makeup artists or sponsored so I always believed that you needed this and that and that other product. Couple things I learned from destashing. Certain products are right for you and others arent. You dont have to have every it product and the ones that dont work never will especially not if you keep beyond expiration. While some can be salvageable with a different tool or such most arent really worth the effort. I kept so many because I thought I would figure out a way to make it work. I didnt.. One comment mentioned hoarders while quite a few of us think of collection. I read somewhere that the difference between collectors and hoarders is the way they feel about their collection pride in the former and shame in the latter. When I think about my gross probably expired lip smackers I feel shame and thats why it has to go. . Products kept should fall into two categories super lovemakes you happy or everyday wear items. I had some old nail polish I was not super into and there was no way I could pull off bright orange nails.. A few people mentioned how the costs factor into this. I have this issue too. I had a bottle of lotion I loved but didnt finish. It was kinda expensive and came in a sealed pump bottle so I used it. I woke up this morning with a lot of break outs. I threw away all the old stuff that I thought of salvaging. So if you have price hangups just ask yourself is X really worth ruining your skin? After all wasnt the point of spending that money to make your skin better? . Next time you buy think of all the ghosts of products past and if that new product will join them. Dont buy if you arent absolutely positive it wont.As a final conclusion to this heres a summary of my destashing makeup items skincare items body sprays nail products lip products  of which are all the lip smackersThanks for giving me the push to throw away all the junk I held onto for ages! I hope my tips help out the rest of you with similar problems. Good luck!,MakeupRehab,czpzluj,6,t5_32g1x
6484748,0,t3_44dqdv,Im exactly the same as you! Im almost at . months and Ive gotten all the same realizations as you! Its kind of refreshing and this satisfaction in a way deters you from wanting to buy more items!I kept a gratitude notebook so i would start realizing everything that I already had and so I wouldnt take anything for grantedThis no buy also makes you realize things in your collection that you think are absolute shit and would consider destashing as well as finding gold in your stash that you would repurchase and you would definitely include in an ideal collection. Shop your own stash and find your own HGs within it instead of being tempted to have everything that OTHER PEOPLE claim are HG. Really taught me that I wanted to have my own style instead of adopting other peoples styles like makeup gurus or what not.,MakeupRehab,czq2kei,3,t5_32g1x

6486906,0,t1_czppb2h,I cant really picture in my head how you use the plastic things but would getting one of those clear acrylic organizers for lipstickscompacts help organize your makeup? It might reduce some of the packaging clutter!I didnt think about how different batches have different warnings oops.

6487606,1,t3_44i2s2,Its even worse in Canada since shipping costs are usually higher and the threshold for free shipping is usually higher. Ive certainly noticed myself falling for adding items to get free shipping or in some cases adding items even if I have to pay for shipping because then the cost of the shipping is spread out over more items. Been trying really hard to be more aware of this behaviour and stop doing it.With Sephora I usually will spend the  and then take back whatever bits and bobs I added on that I decide I dont actually want in the time between placing and receiving the order.

6498779,0,t3_44l941,So! Ive come to the realization that yes...a travel size kvd shade and light eye palette is still a good idea...but do I need THREE? No. So...Im going to take it easy and pick only two if I really need them. But that honestly it will take me forever to finish the palette version of it. So its better to save my money for a cool palette and to splurge minimally. These will be my dedicated overnight and travel palettes though.Also Ive decided to take part in the miniocalypse and Ive decided that I need to mess with my makeup more often and not be afraid to be a little liberal with it.Just last night I tested out some shades in the electric palette which I hadnt even touched and attempted to figure out how to make them REALLY pop. Sadly painterly pot wasnt much of a help. ,MakeupRehab,czritmg,2,t5_32g1x

Ive been working on a couple for the past month and a half but Im starting to think with how long it takes to pan a lipstick maybe I should use these all to at least halfway and then switch it out for another from my collection and repeat? I bought all my lipsticks at around the same time so when they go bad theyre all going to go bad at once and maybe by doing this Ill be able to use them all evenly? Im not sure.

The color is...not great. The light side is actually a fantastic match for my skintone and kind of erases other stuff so if the compact werent so hugenormous Id take the light powder with me to correct eye makeup etc. But the contour color is really warm even on MY supayellow skin it looks orange. And I realized that even when I accomplished what I was supposed to I dont prefer the way my face looks contoured. I like my features and contouring to bring them closer to the mean so to speak more heartshaped face slimmer nose prominent cheekbones isnt really what I want to do.So ultimately it was a good price to pay to realize that I dont want contouring as part of my everyday routine. I feel bad about throwing the compact away because the light powder is so nice but its GIANT so again I should probably just trash it.,MakeupRehab,d0awhkh,1,t5_32g1x

The size is too small though. WNR.  Shower Gel  LOccitane I only bought it because of the smell and art deco packaging. Otherwise it was unremarkable. WNR.  Green Tea Body Lotion  LOccitane Smelled wonderful but not really moisturizing. Good for a light layer in the summer. WNR.  Satsuma Body Butter  The Body Shop Had a weird soapy texture to it. The fragrance is almost too overwhelming. WNR.  Vice Pumpkin Butter  Haus of Gloi This formula works best after youre freshly showered its more of an occlusive. This particular scent smelled almost foul because of its strength. WR in another scent. Manuka Honey and Marula Oil Intense Hydration Hand Cream  Shea Moisture Very emollient and smells like gorgeous honey. WR.  Hot Singles Eye Shadow in Taupe  NYX Great cool brown everyday color.

I think your best bet would be to decide exactly how many of the shadows in the palette you will definitely wear not maybe not makingitwork  what are you actually going to use on a daily basis. Take the cost of the palette and divide it by the number of eyeshadows you guarantee you will use realistically. If the costpershadow is too high then thats the sign that you are better off purchasing a couple eyeshadow singles to fill that pinkmauveplum gap in your collection.Edit. Example    shadows   for  shadow.

6878355,0,t3_49yeki,Today is the last day of vacation for me...going back home tomorrow morning. Im not really looking forward to job hunting again but I am eager to be back in my own bed and go to a hockey game and see my friends. I dont have any big plans for today really...just to go to the Birchbox store but then just come back to clean up my sisters apartment and reorganize my suitcase. I did laundry yesterday so thats out of the way. If I think of something else to do while Im out Ill go but Im pretty much finished with activities at this point.On a side note I really hate Internet bullying. My friend runs a Facebook page as a hobby so social media isnt a part of his job or anything he has a desire to do as a career and I disagreed with one persons opinion. She told me Im not allowed to talk because shes seen me feeding my face at hockey games so it seems I dont pay attention to my team. Mind you this girl isnt some bikini model herself and has done nothing but be a bitch to other people on the page and make snide comments about how she doesnt like the posts. My friend finally had to tell her she is free to leave he page if she has a problem with what is said. The kicker is that a girl like this gets a boyfriend and a relationship while I cant even attract the attention of a guy beyond a nice guy type which is horrible. Why do the most awful girls seem to always have boyfriends who adore them and fall all over them?  ,MakeupRehab,d0vz49w,3,t5_32g1x

Or if they dont they pile on yellowtoned foundation fake bake dye their hair and pretend that theyre exotic. In quotes because thats a very westerncentric way of looking at heritage. Since I dont look like that at all seeking out bloggers who look more like me helps dispel the illusion of unobtainable beauty that advertising loves to weave.

6950155,0,t3_4awk48,I love samples! I havent gotten anything too crazy from a Birchbox so a lot of time I just try it right away. I work at a hospital in the middle of nowhere so a lot of people arent really into makeup here either. If I get something that Im not sure how to usenot sure how it would work out then I usually wait for a day off and use it then. I dont care if random people at walmart judge me so even if it looks not so hot at least I got a day of practice and I got a better feel for a product. Of course you can always try stuff on a day when your not going anywhereafter work and practice with it then. I like using stuff right away because I feel like if I just put things in a draweraway somewhere I forget about it and then I hoard it and part of my rehab journey is no more hoarding things. Plus I really like empties and I feel like using up samples is a good way to get easy empties! However its always been a goal of mine to use up at least  box items before I get another box and if I dont then I have to cancel the box that I havent used any items from because if Im not using the items then Im obviously not too excited about that box I used to be a sub box addict.Plus think of it this way lets say every Birchbox you get  items and you havent used any items since you got them so you said  months.  times  is  items that you have just lying around that arent being used. And thats  worth of products that are just there taking up space. Id say try them out get your moneys worth and get rid of the clutter. Im not saying you have to use all your Stainiacs Trestique eye crayons and CR highlighters at once but just give everything a go when you first get it and if you dont like it get rid of it right away after making sure you dont like it so you dont have tons of products lying around. Trust me after  years subbing to tons of boxes I have so much stuff lying around because I was at first like oh I cant use this or how do I use this?

Im trying to figure out your statementgtgt I feel guilty on my mother who cant afford luxuries as I do mainly because she doesnt work as many hours but it is still so over indulgent and selfish of me especially to keep it upI think what you need to do is sit down and look at your finances.  I think its great that youre here looking for advice because thats a step in the right direction. If you can meet with a therapist I would highly recommend it because something is compelling you to shop.  Are you unhappy? Is this a substitute for something like boredom? Are you shopping your feelings? Etc.  Feeling guilty will not stop you from shopping.However I do think you need to sit down and come to terms with your financial picture.  See how much money you are bringing in and then you can determine how much you can actually afford to spend nicetohaves once you account for all your expenses.  More information on how to budget here from rpersonalfinanceKeep in mind credit card rates.  Most interest rates once they hit the double digits are considered predatory.  Once this debt grows it almost becomes impossible to pay it off unless you aggressively tackle it and address it.  is not a paltry sum but you can get this under control before it spirals out of control.I am a huge advocate and believer of budgets because they literally tell you how much money you have and how much you can buy because you allocate numbers in each category. Other things you can do after addressing the main issue Unsubscribing from mailing lists newsletters etc.   Limit your YouTube video watching or eliminate altogether   Take an inventory of your stash. Lay it out before you.  Can you use it all?  Remember  makeup expires   Shop your stash! Most like you have a dupe for whatever youre lusting after.   Bored?  Dont shop!  Be productive.  Go to the library.  Learn a new skill.  Clean your room.  Using a real life example consider this on your credit cards.   APR with a  minimum which is a  minimum payment.  By paying your minimum without incurring more debt it will take you  months to pay off your debt where youll pay an additional . in interest.

7010530,0,t3_4bo0hr,To add to what ulgbtqbbq said orange correctors would probably be too dark for you. Im NC and when I first looked for color correcting tutorials years before this whole trend kicked off the only tutorials were from women NC who recommended straight up orange under the eyes which will most likely be difficult for your skin tone. Try mixing the orange with skintoned concealer to bring it down to a more peachy tone see if that helps. Make sure you do not use very light whitebased concealer for this as things will get ashy real quick.I would chuck the mint green tbh. Its not going to do anything for you. I also doubt the purple will work for you as I have a similar skin tone and find sheer peach to work best to counter sallowness in my skin.

But if youre committed you will get through it eventually.I like her philosophy but I dont really feel like her method is practical for me. If I gathered things from all over the house and put them on the floor somewhere so I can pick everything up one item at a time and hold it my child would be drawn to it instantly and start helping.Plus her book is written with the assumption that you will throw all the unwanted things away and be done. I would rather not do that as there are many nice usable things that Id rather give to someone who will use them instead of filling space in a landfill. So its a process of picking through all the discards getting rid of the things that are actually trash recycling the things that can be recycled e.g. clothes with holes gt textile recycling not trash selling what I can e.g. slightly outdated electronics gt Amazon tradein sorting things into bins for donating to different organizations and then actually taking all the stuff where it needs to go. Doing all that takes a long time too.So Ive been slowly going through and discarding over a period of months. Im far from done especially because I keep going back to categories I think Ive finished and realizing I can get rid of more but its definitely made a difference.,MakeupRehab,d1zz9ny,3,t5_32g1x

7268059,0,t1_d249r4k,Ive heard that one is really crumbly just as a forewarning. Which sucks because Rose Jam is definitely the greatest Lush scent. I hope you like the solid shampoo though. I really like using solid products because I get really overwhelmed with lots of bottles! I love the Jungle conditioner too for what its worth although I know a lot of people hate how it smells. I really like it. So anyway Im distractable today just keep in mind the Jason solid shampoo I think is the most crumbly so if you have that problem it may not translate to the other formulations.

7308133,0,t3_4fh659,Im slightly lighter than you NC  with neutral leaning towards yellowolive undertones combinationoily. I also prefer dewier finishes and Ive found that between a priming base and a setting spray I dont really run into issues with lasting power when it comes to BBCC creams. Ive tried a couple Korean BB creams and they tend to run on the pink side for brighteninglightening and most shades will not match medium tones exactly because they are usually for fairer tones or to make yourself appear fairer. I would not recommend it if you are NC  unless you are prepared to mix products. Ive been using the Stila Tinted Moisturizer with success if youre interested in trying another lightcoverage option.I have a couple suggestions Try mixing a couple drops of a foundation that lasts longer into your lighter products. Sometimes the qualities of a matte formula helps it stick to your primer better. Be mindful about if youre touching your face or not. I know that when Im having a long day or I didnt sleep well the night before I tend to touch my face more without thinking about it. This will force any dewy formula to migrate and rub off. Try an actual foundation instead of a BBCC cream. It might just be that BBCC creams do not work for your skin in particular. There are still light alternatives in the foundation realm that arent  mattelooking. Edit.

I want all products that are easy to use and are of a certain caliber of quality. I work seven days a week so I need products that work with me and are professional. Like you this means neutral eyes etc. It also means every aspect of a product has to fit my lifestyle in terms of colors packaging ease of use is it travel friendly etc. I like sleek streamlined products that dont require much thought or touching up. Included brushes in things like brush compacts are great for doing makeup on the train and lip products I can apply without a mirror are a plus. Im not as interested in buying new things.

I dont reach for them much because I cant just throw some on in the car mirror or in the bathroom while Im out. With few exceptions different reds are all I wear for lipstick so I bought F Bomb and its probably the last red I reach for just because it takes so much more effort to wear. The other one I have is Shame deep purple which goes on sortof patchy and the second the color transfers ends up becoming more of a magenta.Even at  I wouldnt buy these again.

Not at all.A couple thingsThis palette has been very uninspiring to me. I feel like I can only mostly make very neutral and basic looks with a couple of exceptions. The problem with that is that I own waaay too many neutral palettes so this just feels very repetitive. I didnt love the formula of some of the shadows. Some of them feel kind of hard to work with and a couple of my looks turned out muddy. And plum! Oh plum... Such a disappointment. I couldnt get it to look purple on me at all. It kept turning out grey. Some of the looks I made near the end of the week turned out better so Im feeling kind of conflicted. Honestly I dont want to continue using this palette which is the opposite of what I felt when switching with my last two palettes. But thats exactly why Im going to continue using it for this next week. I want to be sure before I destash it and see if theres anything I can do to make myself love it!

Well ever since Mercury went into retrograde has my life been D  normally I ignore stuff like that but like lets just recap a little bit. Working from home last friday I sent in my hours to my boss. Three hours later I get an email from her berating me for not sending my hours in saying she shouldnt have to chase me when I work from home. Saturday the gym is too crowded and I had to wait  minutes for a lifting platform because no one would share with me even though I went at my normal time and its usually dead then Monday my sister cancels her birthday plans with me last minute and doesnt tell me I have to find out from my brother Tuesday I drive  miles to see my doctor only to find out they canceled the appointment. They say they called me and left me a message but my phone doesnt have any voicemails on it. Been so busy with last minute projects thrown on my lap on Wednesday and Thursday that I have had to stay late and been too tired for the gym. I developed a weird cough My Edad wont stop trying to trick me into visiting the house This morning I was touching up my makeup at my desk had all the contents emptied at like am mind you and the director of the museum comes by to see my boss who is out of town and never comes into work earlier that am anyway so why the eff was he there?!.

7616023,0,t3_4jmxn9,It looks like the shadows are held within a plastic plate that is inserted into the body of the palette. Your best bet is to take a flathead screwdriver and wedge it into the crack between the palette parts. Like so I did this fast with a random image I found on google. Just a mini flathead wedged into a few spots and with any luck itll pop out.Once its popped out you can explore the back of the plate holding the shadows. There may be slots where you can push the tins out. You may also have to do the classic hold it over a candle technique to melt the glue that holds the pans into the plastic plate. I havent done this so I have no idea what the inside looks like but based on how packaging usually works that is your best bet. You cant approach the tins from the topoutside because they are edged with smooth plastic that wont bend. You will break the shadows if you do that.,MakeupRehab,d37whkg,1,t5_32g1x

7693189,0,t3_4kowxz,Dont rush into buying it you dont need to settle on that just because its listed as a dupe on Temptalias site. There are lots of longwearing matte lipsticks out there bullet AND liquid so I would try before you buy to make sure you REALLY want THAT red and in that formula. I personally prefer longwearing matte bullet lipsticks and while I do have a couple liquid mattes I tend to use them only mixed as they are too drying alone. If you dont think  you need another red you should destash your other reds before making any new purchases. And dont fall into the trap of Oh but I need THIS red for THIS occasion and THIS red for THAT occasion. Right now youre not happyexuberant about ANY red you own. So honestly the next one you buy should be PERFECT and should make you forget about the other ones. So you shouldnt have any problem destashing  or more of your current reds to make room for a really stupendous one.,MakeupRehab,d3gnzp3,6,t5_32g1x

7934217,0,t3_4nu2f0,Okay so I just mixed!Here is the album with the original lipstick  the lipstick with something added on top.So my lipstick of the day was Ofras Long Lasting Liquid Lip in St. Tropez. This is what you see in that first picture. I had previously tried another color from this line and it never dried down which meant awful transfer all day so I wanted to test this color out by itself for some time. This color did dry down and became kinda matte? A bit drying and had some lines but the color stayed everywhere which would cool. I found that this lipstick was incredibly long lasting it lasting through eating yogurt and an avocado me napping licking my lips etc for like five hours. Not that it came off after five hours that was just when I decided to layer it. Because it had dried down I figured I could layer a warmertoned lip crayon over it and see if that made a the liquid lip not as dry and b the lip crayon a little more workable. I used Laura Geller Love Me Dew in Fig Prosecco not the yellowy one I used a bit over a week ago and wasnt sold on Fig Prosecco is a bit darker and I just found it first. This is the second picture St. Tropez  Fig Prosecco.I apologize for the blurriness on the pictures but hopefully you can see the color change well enough! St. Tropez does become a bit more muted once its dry so its not a totally fair comparison photo but I actually really like this combo quite a bit!,MakeupRehab,d47vpre,1,t5_32g1x

I dont know if its just me using it wrong or what but I eventually want to replace this with the Pixi Makeup Fixing Spray since I feel that wont make my skin feel weird and it might be more natural GOAL FINISH Shimmer highlight gt Virgin and Sin from Naked palette  Ive been using these two eyeshadow shades as highlight since the Naked palette is my Pan that Palette for the last half of this year. I really like these two in combination but I would like to pick up the Balms Mary Loumanizer eventually GOAL FINISHEye primer gtUrban Decay Original Primer Potion  I want to finish this one and eventually continue using my NYX eye base since I want to replace it with Too Faces Shadow Insurance or just start using concealer as eye primerGOAL FINISHEye shadow gt Urban Decay Naked Palette  this is my PtP for the second half of the year and I want to hit pan in shadows Hustle Sidecar and Toasted and expand the pans in those for this yearGOAL Hit pan Eye liner gt Marc Jacobs Gel Eyeliner crayon sample size  I like this eyeliner for tightlining but I feel at times it can be a little TOO creamy so when I get some on my lid after I finish my eye makeup I have to wipe everything off and start overGOAL FINISH Mascara gt Tarte Lights Camera Lashes  I discovered that I prefer a lengthening mascara over a volumizing mascara and I dont like using another mascara to make this workGOAL continue using until  September or until it dries out Ive had this since March Lipstick gt Wet n Wilds Bare it All and Marc Jacobs Kiss Kiss Bang Bang lipstick sample size  Im panning both of these for the same reason since I rarely reach for them and theyre MLBBs for me.

8049484,0,t3_4pf41p,Oh thanks for the credit glad I could help! Today I wanted to do something kind of snazzy looking meeting up with my family tonight so I did a soft and smoky eye look using Maybellines Color Tattoo in Inked in Pink and patted a brownypink shadow from Makeup Revolutions Iconic  on top. I did end up doing a winged liner with LOreals felttip pen but since thats included in the product packaging I figured that would be fine! And I topped the look off with Maybellines lipstick in Born With It. I typically do the majority of my base makeup with out brushes anyway so that wasnt really that much different than usual. I feel like it is just a good idea for me to be comfortable not using brushes since I forget mine half the time I travel and really hate washing them so sometimes they get too gross to use.,MakeupRehab,d4ku5qq,3,t5_32g1x

Its definitely calming somehow to know everything in your collection is something you feel is worth it and have zero issues with or regrets about. If there is some type of issue with the product why force yourself to own it? I am compulsive about making sure products like this dont stay in my collection as I prefer a more curated collection which doesnt necessarily mean tiny. Its nice to see everything and know its a collection you worked hard at creating and tailoring to your lifestyle. Better to purchase something that is flawless in your eyes and for your needs and that consistently makes you happy to own and use the product. an added bonus is when the products also make you feel like a fancy lady D,MakeupRehab,d507wxg,2,t5_32g1x

8199917,0,t3_4rmzn7,Ok question do you actually love the shadows you are planning to depot? Second question Are you certain you will use them more realistically? Ideally yes you would use them more...but you have to be honest with yourself. You saidgt I have  eyeshadow palettes by Zoeva that I purchased to bring some more interesting colours and tones to my collection. The palettes are great but I dont reach for them as often as I shoulddot dot dot reasongtbecause rummaging through a bunch of different palettes doing swatches is more than what I can reasonably expected to do before work at am. Is that really the reason or are you hoping thats the reason? If not then you wont use them whether they were all in one palette or in separate ones. I wont deny it will increase the likelihood of using them but only you know for sure.I depotted a bunch of palettes and guess what.... I still havent touched that palette. AT ALL save for the shadows I had already depotted a long time ago. Why? Well Im not sure. Im hoping that this is only because I have been sick and couldnt wear shadows for a few weeks and also that its because Im panning stuff but likely its that Im not that into green or more boring brown eyeshadow. I would like to use them more to figure it out so hopefully this will change! I do like the colors but I need to buckle down and use them to see if they are something I would actually use.,MakeupRehab,d52jkmr,7,t5_32g1x

I ended up researching and asking for TMO of those and realized they werent actually that good. Imagine that all the peoducts are available permanently where you are.

But I do prefer less base  can see my freckles which I like and feels so much better. I just got a KVD concealer bc I didnt have any and am currently trying it out. I do like that it is more conscious of undertones but a lot of the pale ones were warm and not cool so I went with neutral. I think it works still testing it out.Other than that much of my makeup is the same. I tend to do brows eyes curl mascara liner eyeshadow blush highlight and lips.

8763802,0,t3_4zv4zm,I have a mixture its probably about  highmidlow. If the product is great I really dont care about things like packaging or anything else. Probably the biggest drugstore barrier for me is that the stands in the shops near me are usually pretty ratchet. Often there arent testers the ones that are there are mushed or smashed. The colours I want arent in stock. They also seem to turnover lines a lot and I hate finding something I adore only for it to no longer exist two years down the line. For higher end the cost is obviously offputting but also the failure of a product hits harder if I dont like or love it... and that probably gets me down most. I thought the point made by dellaluce was also really pertinent to me I get something social out of using a known popular product.

For a new product MAC strobe cream. Its subtler than a highlighter which might be what youre looking for since most will look glittery and spangly in direct sunlight. If you go to a MAC store or counter you can try it first. Most SAs will even make you a little sample jar of it if you ask them nicely. ,MakeupRehab,d85go6k,6,t5_32g1x

9374528,0,t3_58y9zk,I prefer palettes for eyeshadows but for everything else I prefer singles. Even for eye shadow palettes though the size of Lorac PRO is as big as Id go before getting to a point of being overwhelmed. For blushes it seems to ONLY make sense to get only the flattering colors and face palettes never work out that way for me. I love lipsticks and never finish a full size so I like multipacks of these. The most difficult part is finding a lipstick multipack where I can actually justify most of the shades since my pigmented lips throws things WAY off from a hand swatch. Im definitely interested in multipack eyeliners too although funny enough they are very rarely liquid my preferred formula but rather pencils or even gel so I still mostly end up getting singles.Today Ill keep it incredibly simple will use single eyeshadows in a matte cream color for highlight and another midtone shimmery color as an allover shadow look. I dont have many eye singles but the ones that I do have fall into these two categories. Also maybe just a single blush. I figure the rest of the stuff is given to be a single base eyeliner brow pencil.,MakeupRehab,d94adgy,6,t5_32g1x

Pearl ornaments on top of compacts so they dont sit flat on top of each other? Half the packaging taken up by a scratchy brush I wont use? Its my current goto blush but it doesnt actually provide me with much joy when I apply it.And the only reason you want it is because its not a bronzer its a butter bronzer. It sounds fancy and means pretty much nothing. Cocoa butter or shea butter or whatever doesnt belong in a bronzer.Its seriously not worth breaking a nobuy over.The cheap way to try the bronzer is find someone who already owns it and ask them if you can swatch it. Not to spend like . Where do you work? Ask yourself if the most annoying thing you had to deal with for  of your time is worth a bronzer when you already have like ten.You have done so so well in keeping up your nobuy.

The two darker colors I bought a shimmery finish and a satin finish were absolutely awful. The pigment barely showed up on my extremely pale IrishDutch skin and were very patchy. HOWEVER the other two that I bought Gem and Soft Gold are absolutely gorgeous! They have a superior formula from the other two. I later went into Sephora to swatch a bunch of others that I had been interested in and found the same inconsistencies. Some of them were fine and some were just awful.    Long story short do not buy any of these unless you can swatch them in person or have read enough reviews to know which ones will work and which ones wont. ,MakeupRehab,dacnvq1,7,t5_32g1x

9765412,0,t3_5ez3o8,Hey! Some more makeup decided to die this week! And my first perfume sample that I didnt spill! Dermal Sea Cucumber Supreme Mask  This had the shitty cut that Ive only experienced with one other mask before. No eye holes just flaps. Mask itself did not make my skin look particularly great after. B item. WNB Catrice ReTouch LightReflecting Concealer in  Ivory  A thicker version of Touche clat. I prefer more liquidy textures but this is much cheaper. Subtly luminising with medium coverage. Finally ran fully dry after a year of onoff usage. This one never stops twisting which is confusing when approaching EOL. I have the shade  Light Beige on hand to try next. WR Daiso DEPCIA sheet mask in Collagen  Better than the other Daiso masks. Theres a Daiso within walking distance the I have free time to stroll round sort of walking distance from my home so these are probably the cheapest and fastest option for sheet masks for me. WR Heroine Make Naitemo mittyaku Eyeliner in Rich Black  This thing survived for almost two years. Untrue to its name this does NOT last through crying or even watery eyes. I prefer something longerlasting and blacker though this certainly was not badit gave a very clean line and it was somehow easier to use than my other pen liners. MR Hang Ten Classic Sport SPF Sunscreen  Mini from Ipsy. Dont have much of an impression about this because most of it leaked out even with the cap closed.... And when I cut it open there was some brown oil floating on top which was gross. Maybe it was just old. MB Milky Dress Premium foil sample  B item. This is one of those tingly titanium dioxide creams that can optionally be used as washoff packs. I will say that this one lasted a pretty long time when I didnt rinse it off. I opened this up to blur out my pimples on a nomakeup day. Works okay for that but it only slightly blurs scarsredness because trying to apply multiple layers looks chalky. MB Daiso DEPCIA sheet mask in Coenzyme Q  Finished the box of three. WR Nivea Sun Protect Water Gel SPF  Second bottle finished. It was cheaper than the Bior. MR Sixteen Wicked perfume sample mL  The almond buttercream note makes this smell purely like burnt plastic and PlayDoh. This note is especially strong on the skin but it was also noticeable when applied to clothing and sheetscherry and marzipan over plasticky chemicals. WNR Urban Decay  Velvet GlideOn Pencil DS in Black Velvet  What a completely unredeemable piece of shit. I dont know if it was just the Ipsy batch was just bad but this performed like itd been dried out for years. Draggy and required a lot of pressure on the eye applied patchily did not go on black but charcoal crumbledlifted itself when applied in more than one stroke over itself or any other cream or product that dries in a layer providing with any resistance flaked off into eyes during wear.... Looking at Makeupalley I was not the only person with these issues. Big chunks of lead also broke offfell out every time I tried to sharpen it beyond mm which caused me to finish more than half of this pencil in one day. Good luck trying to get the tip of this thing sharp. Only buy this if you want to wear bits of eyeliner on your eyeball. My eyes were red at the end of the day with this because of all the flaking. WNB Aubrey Rosa Mosqueta Night Creme  This stuff was sooooo luxurious. Very rich and oily great as an eye cream. Looks like it has now been renamed to Revitalizing Therapy Night Crme. Received as a gift four years ago way too expensive for me to buy myself. WR at steep discount. Simply Duo Whitening Mask  Tried this again this week on a weekend when I knew I wouldnt be seeing anyone to see if Id get an allergic reaction again... which I didnt.

Doesnt chip for a week with a good top and base coat is very opaque and the color can be worn all year round but I feel that it might be more suited for the spring as its a little pastely or the winter because of the coolness of the color..

10088159,0,t3_5k9rpx,Ive had to get my shopping habits together over the years. It started out in university  I was always pretty responsible until my friend got me into the concept of trying things on for fun which ended up in buying a ton of clothes I really didnt need. And then I discovered Bath and Body Works and similar stores... I would always go to the mall with friends but eventually started going alone and buying tons. It was usually when I felt sadunhappy with life situations  bad mark no friendsroommates around a boy treating me badly the breakup that followed. When I was finished school and moved back home I could feel the judgement of my family for all that I kept buying. My bedroom floor was covered in bags of things I bought and had no room for and that lasted for over a year! I think my spending was the worst during the bad relationship and getting over him also kind of helped me try to shop less. And I discovered MUR too! So now it helps keep me on track.,MakeupRehab,dbmi63v,2,t5_32g1x

One of my favorite lipsticks at the moment its a nice warm nude. Gotta wear it before I get sick of it . Wet n Wild Megalast Lipstick in Bare It All. Nice peachy nude.. Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in Berry Haute. Fun bright purple that I wear frequently. Hopefully will be able to kill it with frequent reapplication its a bit sheer.. Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in Rum Raisin. Just what it sounds like a dark burgundyish brown. Love this lipstick but Im starting to get a little tired of browns so I need to use it up before I never want to wear it again!. Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in Rose Velvet. I used to love this lipstick but Im starting to get tired of it. I need to use it up before Im completely sick of it.. LOreal Colour Riche Lipstick in Saucy Mauve. This pulls more pink than mauve on me but I loooove it. Its a bit sheer so hopefully frequent reapplication means I can use it up!. Marc Jacobs lipstick in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang DS from Sephora bday gift. This is a nice midtone pink. Since its a deluxe size hopefully I will be able to use it up!. Maybelline Color Jolt in Stripped Down. I love the formula of these theyre like a very pigmented lip gloss. This is a nice nude and I wear it fairly often so I can probably use it all up.. LOreal Infallible Gloss in Suede. LOVE this gloss! Its kind of a pinky peachy nude with gold glitters in it. I think it might be a dupe for Nars Orgasm? . LOreal Colour Riche Gloss in Soft Brown. This was the first lip gloss I ever owned and I picked up a new tube recently for nostalgias sake and havent been getting enough use out of it!. MAC Star Trek Lipglass in Warp Speed Ahead. This is a really fun sheer purple gloss with blue glitters. It looks really good on top of Revlon Berry Haute as well which is also on this list D. Wet n Wild Balm Stain in Mauve This is super easy to just chuck on for a pinky stain. You get a huge amount of product so Im not sure whether Ill be able to use up the whole thing by next year but a girl can dream!I love wearing all sorts of crazy bright colors but you wouldnt know it from this list haha.

Using up over  items! Im actually using my collection and using things up! This years list has some products that Ive had around for ages. So it feels great to finally finish them.

10143397,0,t1_dbtofv0,I dont have a separate post but I can definitely share some of the thought process that went into destashing my palettes.Several of my shadow palettes were drugstore trios amp quads many of which were of not particularly good quality and were duped by my larger palettes so those were fairly easy to get rid of. The ones that were harder were my more expensive larger palettes. These it came down to dupes quality and sheer enjoyment of using the palettes. For a while I tried focusing on one palette a month but after doing that for a few months I realized that I would get frustrated with certain palettes and wishing I was just able to move on to others in my collection which made me realize which palettes I actually like using. I got rid of a Smashbox travel palette because the quality just wasnt working well for me and I had dupes of most of the colors. I got rid of my Naked Basics because the Naked  Basics worked with my coloring much better. I depotted  shades from my Naked  and got rid of the rest because I didnt really use or like the other colors. I depotted a Stila palette and then wound up only keeping  shades because they were the only ones I really liked. The hardest one to give up was a Nars palette that Id bought as a graduation gift for myself when I graduated college but only used one or two shades from and couldnt really depot them. Im debating on picking up  Nars single in the same formula as the palette I destashed but only after I use up some similar dupes that I already own.Currently I have  eyeshadow palettes and a bunch of singles many of which dupe each other but I cant quite bring myself to destash quite yet. My palettes are Urban Decay NakedBasics Urban Decay Naked  Lorac Pro  and the It Naturally Pretty Palette. Through these I actually have a pretty good range of shades plus some singles to balance them out and enough shadow to still last me a while. I also can dupe most major palette releases with my collection as a whole which is awesome because Im less tempted to buy more. Thanks for the recommendation on the highlight! I will definitely check that out for swatching  It sounds beautiful!!!,MakeupRehab,dbtoszf,2,t5_32g1x
10148156,0,t1_dbuakjm,Yeah! I only wish the quality was there with the SK palette. The UD mattes I was using in the Naked palette were so much more workable and pigmented. I think its going to go quickly though since the formula is so powdery. In any case Ill start working on my Naked palette when my SK palette is done,MakeupRehab,dbub2on,1,t5_32g1x
10149563,0,t3_5lafx0,Ive chosen two palettes to pan for !I uploaded an album to imgur but the pictures are out of order because I have no idea how to use that site. But you get the idea. Im sure Ill figure it out by the end of the year.First is the Pacifica Enlighten Eye Brightening Shadow Palette that I attempted to get started during my  Pans of Christmas challenge but I didnt get very far. It only has four shadows in it which makes it impossible to create complete looks on its own but I want to use it up and see it gone. It has a nude shade called Skinny Dip that has a subtle shimmer and is great as a lid shade. Then it has a peachy shade called Coral Sand that I actually didnt like until I realized how pretty it was when paired with the right purple shadow but not the one in this palette. Next is a yellowy gold called Golden. Sadly I dont like yellowy golds so I really need to push myself to use this. The last color is a dark plum that leans a little brown called Urchin. My goal for this palette is to completely pan the three shadows I like and hopefully create a nice dip in the yellow gold.Second is the Urban Decay Anarchy Face Case. My friend who got this as gratis while working at Sephora gave it to me a few years ago minus the eyeliner and lipstick. It has two blushes a highlighter and five eyeshadows. The blushes are called Fetish a mauvey pink with a hint of shimmer and Quickie a hot pink. The highlighter is a subtle and pearly gold called Craze. The shadows are Redemption a sparkly gunmetal Fray a mauvetoned nude and the only shadow in my palette with a visible dip in it Vaporize a shimmery cooltoned dark brown Provocateur which could be such a pretty color but in reality its pure lavender glitter with no pigmentation and Revolt a sparkly silver that almost looks a bit blue. My goal is to completely pan the highlighter one blush probably Fetish and at least three of the shadows while making considerable dips in the others.,MakeupRehab,dbuhnyl,6,t5_32g1x
10151389,0,t1_dbun9za,Depending on your skin tone you can use Venus to set your eye primer or highlight your face.

Sometimes I have things that I legitimately dont know about  those things get put in a tester pile where I try to give it a chance for a while. Usually Ill start using it and pretty quickly be able to decide whether I like it or dont.

Even though the pomade has a great formula and the color match is better for me than the pencil I always always reach for the pencil. Why? Because its quick and easy and I like that. If you know you favor products that you can use quickly and easily dont get a pomade. Pomades can give great results but they take time. If you really want it finish the powder up and then get the pomade. If you only have one brow product at a time youll be forced to use it unless you then default to using a matte shadow or something.,MakeupRehab,dcf2msn,19,t5_32g1x

10430281,0,t3_5pchgf,I love barw minerals eyeshadows in both loose and pressed. I love their formula pigmentation and blendability. Now lets talk about your collection  eyeshadows is so much eyeshadow. I think you should swatch every shade and compare the palette to what you already own. Then you should use these shades for at least a week and see if you really love them. Sometimes they look so pretty together but in reality you find they dont work for your skin tone. Or they dont work together color wise. Or theyre too smokey and you only do toned down looks. If you still love the shades maybe destash any similar shades theyre brown gold and copper aka the most common shades in the world so your collection can be something you can make use of before expiration. Lastly you say you have no browns that are the perfect brown. Have you tried mixing two browns togwther for the perfect brown. Maybe a too light brown and too dark brown. ,MakeupRehab,dcqcavw,2,t5_32g1x

I am kind of down on my job because I didnt get a promotion I was lied to about being a lock for and what I find even worse is when it takes  minutes sometimes to get a shuttle bus to the train station which means my commute is sometimes  min to get home. so I started looking around for stuff closer to home. I applied for something about  weeks ago and hadnt heard anything but one of their recruiters emailed me about another job yesterday thats been open even longer! I am going to hopefully have a short phone interview next week so I hope it goes well. I would have to travel most of the month which worries me about my birds though my parents would take them in no problem but theyre like my children D. Fingers crossed!And also excited I didnt buy anything from ulta and gave my code away so there is no temptation later. YES.,MakeupRehab,dd0yuth,1,t5_32g1x
10537462,0,t1_dd2hi7r,Its not Fireball its Midnight Cowboy. And it is a goddamn glitter bomb. Its sort of a sheer whiteish color that is absolutely full of chunky silver glitter that rains down upon my face whenever I use it. The only way Ive found myself able to use it is wet as a liner.I wish I hadnt grabbed it honestly. The only benefit Ive gotten from it is knowing that I never ever will pay for a UD shade with glitter because itll just wind up in my hair in my mouth and even ON MY LAP if Im working at my desk.,MakeupRehab,dd2jdha,9,t5_32g1x

10604648,0,t3_5rmbou, What do you think about Project Panning this can include Pan That Palette Project Use It Up etc.?I tried participating in a palette panning. I finished some of it but eventually left because it felt too boring and restricting. On the other hand having a few panning goals is something that works for me  I have a cream blush that I use by default unless I specifically need another shade for example.  What are the first things that come to mind when you hear about someone actively trying to finish a product?Passively yes but actively I dont quite get. I make the distinction here  for example making a decision to use one item exclusively is something trying to finish items purposefully by wasteful use is something else. To each their own but I dont get that  if the item does not give me any pleasure Id rather throw it out than try to use it up any which way.  What do you think about decluttering? This used to be my hardest struggle I would let products linger on for much longer than their useful life. I dont do decluttering just for the purpose of a tidy vanity I also dont have big enough of a collection so physical size is not a problem. However through MUR and some of the discussions here I now declutter stuff that I dont see a useful life for and does not give me pleasure in owning.  What do you think of decluttering vs. panning? Two completely different things. Panning for me is for something that is actually good but has gotten neglected for one reason or another or has gotten to its last  and then got forgotten somehow I tend to do that a lot. Decluttering is for things that have gone bad or makes me wonder why I got it in the first place.  Do you participate in any panningrelated challenges? Whywhy not? I dont participate in group challenges. I enjoy reading about them but somehow I havent come across one that pulls me in.  Are there any other ways you manage your makeupbeauty stash? I made a list of my neglected items and use a random number generator to try one or two items every week. At the end of the day I make a decision to throw out or keep. This gives me a sense of satisfaction both ways  if something obviously does not work it is very satisfying to have it out of the makeup basket and if something does work then Ive rediscovered an item. ,MakeupRehab,dd9seh1,1,t5_32g1x

Im tied between being as minimal as possible yet having backups to save money as I buy in bulk when specials are on and also because theres nothing worse than running out at a bad time. A few times Im having a relaxing day off from work jump in the shower only to realise Im out of toothpaste or conditioner or something of the sort and I have to drive out to the store which Id rather not do.

Cookies are my specialty and I like experimenting with different flavors. I knew I had to follow cottage laws and I had glanced over them before. But I guess I didnt realize how much cottage laws require. Ingredients? Check. Allergen information? Check. Address? Okay... but check. Food safetyregulation disclaimer? Okay... but check. Weight? Yeah I dont have a kitchen scale. Apparently for the bake sale it is highly encouraged to bring store bought goods. At first I was like No way! Thats lazy! But now I understand why. I had been entertaining the idea of starting a low key cookie business but the restrictions that the cottage laws put in place is just discouraging.

I did end up buying a new powder kind of a replacement but I havent had powder since October lol and a Foundation today but still less than th of your total. When your order comes in I would honestly take some time and consider everything you bought and if you can dupe it in your collection. Unless youre not taking rehab seriously then do what you wish. But especially in one go nobody needs almost  worth makeup.

The look turned out okay I guess. I was rushed cause mornings so my blending is a little off. I also find that cool toned browns look great on me but these shades seem too cool toned?

The main approach I can think of is to be completely honest with the artist and tell them right away if there is something you dont like. For example I immediately mentioned Im not a fan of the red carpet contour and highlight look I usually settle for BB cream and spot concealing and that I want to minimize chances of flashback ex. for an event with expected photography they totally respected that and adapted accordingly!,MakeupRehab,deiadj9,7,t5_32g1x

11107901,0,t3_5wvh04,Just found this sub so Im late to the comments here. But. I was so tempted by this lip palette until I realized how many NYX lippies my Achilles Heel I can buy with .So I did as the first commenter suggested bought blackwhiteblueyellow already had red during the NYX  off sale for far less than the price of the palette. And between the lippies I own and all the samples in my stash I can mix colors anytime. Color science!My other motivation is to use what Ive already purchased without destashing. I can now use up those notquiteright colors by blending them mostly with blue or black in my case. I already have a few empty small jars so if I find a perfect mix I can make up a bunch at once.I also have an empty magnetic palette and some mini round metal pans so I can when I get the urge create my own portable palette. Just typing all this out is really helpful as a reminder to myself that I have plenty of lipstick options and dont need to buy anymore for a very very long time.,MakeupRehab,der2k8v,2,t5_32g1x

I thought oh I have a wedding to go to this week I should get a new lip color. I swatched a few colors and really liked some but then I thought wait you have like  lip colors that you never use PLUS you have a few minis from ipsyplay that you should use.I ended up not getting a lip color and Ill be using one of my minis for the event.I also resisted buying the Naked Ultimate Basics palette which I really want but dont need because I rarely use eyeshadow and when I do it is usually one color.

I loved the shade Jingle from Lime Crimes holiday sets but couldnt justify spending all that money for one color thats not even full sized. I also didnt want to give money to Lime Crime because Ive heard too many negative things about their business practices. And now ofc Jingle is available as an individual full size when theyd previously said it would be limited edition only which just supports my dislike for buying from Lime Crime.Anyway I managed to find a seller who was willing to part with just that shade so it worked out!

Its sturdy and visually interesting. And its a fabulous color. Also very happy with it because its not as shimmery as all the NARS blushes I had to destash even though Becca seems like theyd put out only shimmery blushes.

11241228,0,t3_60evr7,Ugh Im trying to pan the NYX BB cream and Ive been at war with it since I got it. I should have returned it but its past that time now and I dont want to toss it so Im trying to just work through it. First of all its the wrong shade for me so I need to add in a white mixer to make a  combo of the two. Unfortunately this changes the texture a bit and makes it go on a bit patchy so I have to spend forever blending it in. Also its very dewy and tends to break up so I need to set it with powder. A lot of powder. I usually hate baking but I can make it work with this and that does allow me to stay matte for most of the day so thats something.I dont have a ton left and hopefully it will be gone in the next couple of weeks but damn is it a pain in the ass. I can eventually make it work but its a hassle.As for wings I just didnt have time today unfortunately.

Or use setting spray then powder. To be honest play with your routine change the orderamount of product take some steps out if it doesnt work in any of those ways powder is not your friend. It might be to do with your moisturiser add oil for extra emollience? Or your foundation maybe you need a lighter layer or need to change it because the ingredients dont mesh with the powder.
