292598,0,t3_1wubd7,Does anyone else on this subreddit remember when and correct me if I am wrong someone posted on raww about the pet hawk that he took in and cared for? What happened with the OP? I seem to remember he was of the fuck the laws attitude and was happy to see many falconers point out he was begging a visit from his states fish and game department.Edit I specifically remember a comment about feeding the bird hamburger meat cringe,birdsofprey,cfb3chl,1,t5_2siy9

1595914,0,t3_2chi1f,Does there exist a hypothetical situation in which you can become a falconer in your current position? Yes. Should you count on this being the case? No.It will be either impossible or highly disingenuous to actually get a first bird until you have a secure place where you live in which to build and maintain proper housing for it.Its good that youve joined the club and you can of course continue to study and meet others but it is better to get all of your ducks in a row and find housing security that cannot be revoked because of a moody landlord or bitchy neighbor than it is to go for it and struggle with everything else on top of making your Expected General Bucket of Newbie Mistakes.,birdsofprey,cjgc22a,1,t5_2siy9
1957422,0,t3_2gxqdj,Fascinating article.In  Frederick II of Sicily commissioned a translation into Latin of an Arabic treatise on falconry entitled De arte venandi cum avibus. ... this work is a combination of two Arabic texts one by Adham and Ghirf and the Kitb alMutawakkil dedicated to the Abbasid Caliph alMutawakkil.I was always under the impression that De arte was Fredericks own work.The following is by no means rigorous. According to this the annual income necessary to support a middleclass family was around  dinars however since were talking Spanish Moors here I cant be positive its a similar value. This doesnt give a monetary value but explains a bit of the history of the coin. Finally this appears to put the value of a dinar at th of an English pound. In the middle ages  English pound would buy you a peregrine falcon. ,birdsofprey,ckp2lsd,1,t5_2siy9

3170214,0,t3_2wghth,I have a fully enclosed cat area on my balcony the cats get in and out via the window and what I assume is a hawk has been sitting on the opposite side for the last two days. Our one younger cat has been watching it like a hawk heres another picture of it flying off when I got to close to itIt comes and goes and I swear this is the same bird that is following me to work.,birdsofprey,coqlaj2,9,t5_2siy9
3337903,0,t1_cp8ov3z,Apparently previous years were more successful. Indy was the one that I thought had the most hope. He fledged without any human intervention but collided with a power line and was electrocuted. Just horrible. D aka Decorah was the most tragic of the trio. He was the youngest most goofy and then when everyone left the nest had the longest most bleak night and day of miserable rain followed by swarms of gnats. When he broke his wing I just collapsed with sadness. It seemed like the whole thing all the Eagles had just been a disaster. The following days turned around a bit but nature is unrelenting and cruel. ,birdsofprey,cp8qvqe,2,t5_2siy9
4587279,0,t3_3du4rj,I believe so. However I dont know a thing about whether there is licensing. Here is a fairly old web page that wants to start a club and here is another blogger more recent who appears to be in touch with a friend of mine Alan Jenkins. ,birdsofprey,ct8tp8y,1,t5_2siy9

6794622,0,t1_d0mg0j0,Oof thats so scary. And yeah about what I figured  theres really nothing you can do if your bird decides to go for a rattlesnake. Maybe carry a big stick to try and help pin it down but man thats one of those situations where you need to keep your wits about you and put your own safety above your birds. Ive done some dumb things to help out my hawks probably worst was wading chestdeep in icy water to get my bird out who had been dragged in by a coot and who probably would have died of hypothermia had I not rescued her and bundled her up in my jacket but man a rattlesnake bite is probably not something Id be willing to risk. Its one of those things that just reminds you this stuff happens in nature all the time these birds take some serious risks and sometimes get killed as a result of just trying to keep themselves fed.,birdsofprey,d0mgl8u,2,t5_2siy9

9255425,0,t1_d8p5x09,Yes. Like I said go back to your bullet points and you will see I wasnt being an ass to you but your response seemed condescending. Its frustrating when people jump into a discussion between two people with their opinion on who started what. Anywho I am not hating. I really sincerely am not. I am not fired up out of hate or worked up because you disagree. I just have a very laissezfaire attitude towards a lot of things and people trying to demand how things should be up to their standard puts me off a bit. I respect that you want whats best for owls I just dont respect your opinion that only a falconer should be allowed to possess one. But again not trying to restart everything Im trying to be civil to you.,birdsofprey,d8p6wxx,1,t5_2siy9
9890669,0,t1_dawqb2q,This is not the case in most goshawk subspecies. The barring on this birds chest as opposed to fine vermiculations tells you this is a Eurasian bird. The males will sometimes get to a deep redorange eye color but often and especially for the females theyll stay orange or yellow. Blood red eyes as far as I know only occur in North American birds.,birdsofprey,dawrzoe,5,t5_2siy9
