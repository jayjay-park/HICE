With all the extra time he has been able to focus on it  and hes much happier. You do need some money to start though. A good home studio set up is essential for quality recordings. ,Voiceovers,cq1oeib,1,t5_2ssij
5843555,0,t1_cxlkjkk,YES but not just boring demos of things nobody wants to hear or of demos only people actively looking for voice actors. You will be creating demos everyday for people who actually want to hear what you are talking about. Its almost analogous to an infomercial. Everyday people scan through articles online that they care about because they cannot find the time to read them. But if there were talented artists bringing that content to them with half the effort it takes to do a demo reel then you will be building a reputation for yourself.I know it sounds unintuitive and not everyone will catch on early but to give you a more nonprogrammer example look at stackoverflow.com s sister sites stackexchange.com . It is filled with people building reputations in industries ranging from comic books to culinary arts.  and  are the closest one to voice acting I could find.The point is you will now have a new stage  almost like the youtube for voice but with the articles as your script. You can choose your niche by selecting articles read by the people you care about and who will possibly consider your reputation when selecting artists for their jobs.,Voiceovers,cxlm7cq,1,t5_2ssij
