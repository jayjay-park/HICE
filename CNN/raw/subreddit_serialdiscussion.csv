2962797,0,t1_co4uv4q,I think those are poor counterexamples. This isnt a BampE with no fingerprints and this isnt an assault with no evidence of assault.A lack of evidence can be persuasive. There were hundreds of students at school that day. Multiple people remember seeing Adnan and Hae separately but nobody saw them leave together. Similarly the police and prosecution tried hard to prove that Adnan was in Leakin Park but they coudnt even after running multiple tests.This doesnt indicate that no crime was committed. Since they were focused almost entirely on Adnan and coudnt find much on him it seems reasonable to think that they should have been looking elsewhere.,serialdiscussion,co4vv6o,13,t5_363b3

2965749,0,t1_co53h74,I have no idea what sort of evidence it would be and I dont think the evidence would have at all included in the case or used to create a timeline.  I think they may have invented a case because they found evidence they couldnt use.It is a possibility it does happen and I find it easier to swallow that a large number of civil servants detectives police officers MEs AMEs prosecutors law clerks etc. were either a bunch of idiots who were very bad at their jobs so that no one picked up on anything that might contradict that states timeline and mentioned it to them before the ran with it to court or that they were all very shady and were collectively convinced that due to Adnans racegenderactivitieswhatever that it was justifiable to prosecutetestify firmly againstfail to test physical evidencefail to investigate thoroughlythe other glaring errors in this case.I guess to me the sheer number of people that would have to fail to notice things or agree to keep quiet about things would be far more likely to be doing so out of a misguided attempt to do that right thing than a collective belief that Adnan should go to jail despite the fact that the story doesnt add up and the main witness is a liar and the cell phone records leave far too much wiggle room.,serialdiscussion,co57yts,2,t5_363b3
2967935,0,t3_2u52ov,Who is sure they can strangle somebody especially a strong athletic girl?  The two most likely culprits tower over her being at least  coupled with the fact that men are generally  stronger than women in brute force.  The idea that men and women are equal does not apply when it comes to muscle strength and force exertion.  I dont mean to be crude but the emotional difficulty of watching a person die assuming the killer is not devoid of feeling would be much more difficult than the actual kill.,serialdiscussion,co5gwoy,5,t5_363b3

3281553,0,t3_2xmlre,OK so I found where the assistant medical examiner Dr Korell was questioned during the trial about the strangulation. I must say I was very surprised by her answers and I know I shouldnt argue with what she says because she is the expert and way more qualified than I am but I will anyway.Asked by one of the prosecutors Korell mentions the bruise on Haes neck which in the autopsy was described as a poorly defined elongated contusion measuring one and one quarter inches by one quarter of an inch but Korell now says it didnt have any particular shape to itQ. Do you have an opinion Dr Korell as to whether strangulation in this case occurred manually by hand or by some other means?A. I dont have any indication that a cord or any other implement was used. There is only a bruise on the front of the neck. It doesnt have any particular shape or anything like that. So in my opinion its manual strangulation.After the prosecutor finishes his brief questioning of Korell Gutierrez questions her a bit more in depth about the damage to Haes neck. She asks whether the underlying damage to the strap muscles of Haes neck corresponds with the location of the bruise and Korell agrees it doesQ. She had the bruise on the right side of her neckA. Yeah. That measured one and a quarter by a quarter yesQ. Okay. And that was consistent with what the findings from inside her body    A. YesQ.   appeared to you correct?A. Yes. YesLater in her questioning Gutierrez asks Korell about whether a strangulation tool would leave marks on the skin and Korell says yes it would but that she found nothingQ.  .   .    .    .  you look very carefully on the skin for evidence that there was some tool that helped cause the strangulation do you not?A. RightQ.  Because the skin would bear marks if there was a rope or line or something else that might help apply equal pressure around the neck correct?A. CorrectQ.  And in your careful examination you found nothing?A. RightI dont understand why Korell thinks the bruise on the neck counts as nothing or that it could be a mark from a rope or line. I know it is only a tiny mark and I am assuming I hope correctly that it was horizontal but it is a mark nevertheless and must have been made by something. Why not a ligature?Later Gutierrez continues her questioning and tries to ascertain whether the strangulation was manual or by some other means Q. Do you have an opinion Dr Korell as to whether strangulation in this case occurred manually by hand or by some other means?A. I dont have any indication that a cord or any other implement was used. There is only a bruise on the front of the neck. It doesnt have any particular shape or anything like that. So in my opinion its manual strangulation.OK so theres a bruise that is described in the autopsy as being one and one quarter inches long and one quarter of an inch wide. Now at the trial Korell is saying it doesnt have any particular shape although people like me would say it has the shape of some kind of rope. Then she concludes that it must have been a manual strangulation because she says there were no marks indicating a rope. So there were no marks of fingers or thumbs of an assailants hands on Haes neck but there was a long thin bruise that could not have been made by the fingers or thumbs of an assailants hands yet she concludes it was manual strangulation. I dont get it. ,serialdiscussion,cp2bo6n,3,t5_363b3

Either way Im incredibly skeptical of Cathy but still find what she has to say not all that important in determining actual innocence or guilt.

3774026,1,t1_cqmcxfb,Well if you could support that view by citing your credentials for making a diagnosis on psychiatric impairment of someone youve never met then I will allow it. Many months ago we or maybe it was just me? created a rule not to allow casual use of accusations of psychiatric of psychological impairments without proper evidence or assessment. People with mental health issues or developmental issues are unfairly stigmatised and these throwaway comments are leading to the devaluation of people with real conditions. I know thats not a common or popular view but I see a lot of people with actual mental health issues and this sort of cavalier use of these terms does them no favours. Maybe its too PC for you but thats the way I intend to approach these comments when my attention is drawn to them such as by a user reporting a comment.In addition I was never happy with private reddit exchanges being posted without the parties permission. ughostoftomlandry ended up in agreement with at view and redacted or removed pics and refrained from posting further information.
