1092448,0,t1_chs96lj,gtI agree with just about everything you saidIm glad to hear it sincerely because many climate activists seem determined to do all they can to turn people off to their message.  Im just sick of the screaming matches.gtI think one of the biggest concerns is educating the larger population of the necessity for action.Roger Pielke Jr. wrote an interesting essay a year or so ago about that very thing.  He pointed to polls in various countries showing that the majority of people actually wanted action on climate change.  As Ive said before the public was all for it in  and .  I dont mean to wreck your enthusiasm but perhaps you might consider that the lack of action isnt due to needing more public awareness.  I think the solutions that were proffered simply werent doable.  You see there are lots of ways to act on climate change but a very vocal group of activists demanded that the only solutions funded were renewables mostly solar and wind and we knew from our work in the s that putting all of our eggs in those baskets was a recipe for failure.gtI also think climate activists need to organize better.Theres no doubt about it.  At present there is no one to restrain loons like Joe Romm or John Cooks little group.  They make activists look like petty whiny zealots.gtI believe those who are passionate about the issue should be boycotting the Koch Bros. products. In my opinion that would be a supreme waste of time and resources.  They sell a commodity coal not oil.  You cant boycott commodity resources.  Thats like saying you would boycott a certain wheat grower.  Someone else will buy the product if you dont.What I would suggest instead is first focussing your efforts on the only thing that can reasonably displace coal production nuclear power.  If you want to hurt coal producers like the Koch brothers there needs to be an alternative to their product.  Solar is great for assisting with peak load in some locations but neither it nor wind are suitable for baseload generation.  There is a division among the climate activists about nuclear power.  So long as you have a house divided on this issue you will see no progress.,climatechange,chsgr3o,1,t5_2rawx

Huge amounts  a freaking Ice Cap for crying out loud. Deal with it or show something to back up your position? Some photos or reports showing that this vast expanse of ice isnt melting and its a fake? You cant so you resort to babbling about gauges!

What evidence do you have here to link them directly? The past and present are completely different time periods.gtYou are literally asking me why I assume that well established causality hasnt suddenly stopped being causal. Actually hunger is caused by a lot of things. Naturally changing climate in the past has cause death across a number of species. This is just as much a part of documented history as anything else right? gtThe onus is on the person saying that all those causes have magically disappeared to be replaced entirely by climate change to put forth the evidence. The author of the article failed to do that thus my criticism stands.Actually they didnt say that at all. They have a specific number of deaths they believe they can attribute to climate change. Thats distinct from the deaths not attributed to climate change. Both can be happening at the same time. I dont think this is surprising or difficult. gtSee above.

Rainfall is and always has been variable. The greatest impactor so far identified is ENSO variability which drives the extreme droughtflood cycles in Australia and effects rain worldwide to lesser extent.Continental glaciers effect only local areas. CO fertalization and warmer temps has led to an increase in vegetation globally.There is no evidence that the oceans are warming or altering pH beyond normal variability. All coral bleaching has occured in areas of high pollution from runoff and ocean dumping of garbage.

It is false to claim they had nowhere to go but up since there were back to normal.The multidecadal warming trend is almost certainly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases.gt Thats a big discrepancy so one or both of those sets must be wrong. Not really since the two datasets measure different things. HADCRUT measures surface temperatures. RSS measures Lower Troposphere temperatures.gtWhat he doesnt mention is that those temperatures are at the low end of simulations. That low end is easily accounted for by natural variability.Actually the models have been pretty good over multidecadal time scales and natural variability cannot account for the observed warming.gtThe study uses modeled land temperatures not actual ones You mean like those from before  for example those who allow us to say there was a LIA and a MWP?gtthat have proven inaccuratecitation neededgtThe study appears to be an effort to salvage the climate models upon which the IPCC effort depends.The models dont need salvaging especially since Trenberths missing heat has mostly been found.

We have empirical evidence that the Earth is retaining more infrared radiation at precisely the absorption wavelengths of CO. COs heattrapping ability has been wellknown and supported by much empirical evidence for more than  years now.gt But I think theres something diabolical behind it. I think you are unduly influenced by religious imagery...gtRead recently that wood is itself a fossil fuel generating CO when burned.Indeed pretty much all combustion involving carbonbased materials produces CO. Growing plants sequester some carbon inside them and burning those plants releases that carbon. The problem isnt really with burning wood though but rather with burning fossil fuels which release carbon that has been sequestered for millions of years.gtwith organisms exhaling CONo one has a problem with organisms exhaling CO.

There is a fair amount of ongoing academic and commercial work in this area but it isnt really financially viable yet. The concentration of CO is still low in absolute terms and turning it into other chemicals requires a lot of energy. One technique that has seen some success is enhanced extraction where they catch CO from smokestacks where the concentration is higher and pump it into oil fields to extract extra fuel. The biggest issue with CCS is scale. Petroleum is just about the most carbon dense material you can imagine and there isnt an obvious place to the store all that carbon after it has been burned.
