Imagine adventuring alone the ash in your face and the sun blocked. You see a little wooden door in a hill marked ancestral tomb. Each tomb was different and they all had ghosts bonewalkers vampires all the coolest and scariest enemies.

1757151,0,t3_2e3u9p,It would be an interesting concept.  I have a fear of the deep ocean especially and what may lurk around you.  With it being an environment where we need external help just to exist.  I think the best option to give a bit of depth to something like this is perhaps being a research scientist in a micro sub.  It would give a reason to be deep you would be unarmed but in a state utterly without help.  Have a routine mission exploring mission.  A loud knock on the sub.  Huh what was that?  Starting getting glimpses in the distance.  Some large creatures perhaps not make death possible in the depths but maybe make the game like a quest to surface  hours.  The creature making sporadic appearances making cracks and fissures the sub filling with water needing to do things to keep it running however without properly checking everything the sub can get cracked open and you are consumed.  Make it so random creatures are chosen as the attacker but consistent in the game you are playing.  Adding replay value.  Each one reacts differently.  I think that would probably be the best way to at least start one.  Maybe use a old style diving bell suit if you wanted people out in the environment.  Some super one to resist all down there.  Then the player has to hide among rocks and crevices.  Maybe make so that the player can attack but not directly.  Such as can attack by using other creatures and attracting them but the danger of course being if that other creature wants them instead of their fishy pursuer.  ,creepygaming,ck0n9xu,1,t5_2tv55

4490011,0,t3_3cckyb,It takes a lot to make me afraid these days.  First off gore doesnt work.  Me and everyone above the age of  has been desensitized to violence.  Its not that it doesnt have its place but it generally takes a more subtle type of creepy to scare.A good example of something that was frightening without gore was Silent Hill .  The game did an excellent job by making enemies that were subconsciously frightening.  A mannequin isnt that scary but a glossy wet multiple legs deformed mannequin was.  Same with the nurses from act .  They failed though with the third common enemy the door people.  They were creepy but I think they were shooting for the look of someone trying to escape a painting and it made more cheesy schlock than legitimately scary.The subconsciously frightening thing goes deeper than though.  I find myself watching a lot of scary games on youtube and its the ones where things are less well defined that really unsettle.  A subdued soundtrack of soft but atonal sounds can go miles to making a game unsettling.  Not knowing why or where you are going can make things unsettling.   Ill point out two examples that almost get it right but shoot themselves in the foot Au sable and Gyossait.  Both of them do a good job of setting a mood.  They use vaguely menacing imagery and subdued ambient sound to set a mood.  Things form something that makes sense but are still unsettling.  Both games fail in the same way by being too much a game.  If anything will take you out of a frightened mood itd be precision timing and platforming. And thats an important lesson the game part of your game is going to seriously affect things.  If the character keeps dying then dying isnt scary anymore and it loses all its oomph.  If the character is never in danger it never was scary or had that oomph.   Difficulty is a hard line to walk in this type of game.Ive got a ton more I could say but Im gonna stop here. ,creepygaming,cswml64,1,t5_2tv55

As soon as you get used to the dark you are thrown in a comfortable brightly lit foyer with chandelier and candles. This cleans your pallette and right after you are thrown in a dark room and the bright room made you uncomfortable with the dark again. You also had to make choices between dark and light. Stay in the dark and stay hidden at the expense of becoming insane and seeing  hearing creepy things? Or move into the light to become sane but expose yourself to the monsters?It really forced you to constantly come out of your comfort zone and regret the decisions you make.Also I dont know if this is true but this is what I heardread somewehere.
