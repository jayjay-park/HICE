5974060,0,t3_3vkutx,Theres nobody great here as you obviously know  if you DO get an extra pick if you dont keep  then Id do that. If thats not on the table I think Id keep Fitzgerald. He has tailed off a bit but showed this year what he can do. My heart says Bortles or Palmer but QBs are relatively cheap so Id go with that.,TheKeepers,cy2qb6g,1,t5_2tkiz
