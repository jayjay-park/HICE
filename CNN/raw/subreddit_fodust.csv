What we know about this character is that he was a Follower of the Apocalypse from California sent to investigate the Sewers.

9134673,0,t3_55dcv1,Ive just accepted that any hit from a human enemy is a hk. Due to the randomness of headshotshead hits you have to treat it that way. Maybe this changes with good armor Ive got almost a full set of heavy leather though which does make a big difference when it comes to Ghouls  theyre struggling a lot more to put me down than they used to  but with humanoids I cant take any chances due to the headshot capabilities they have.   its unfortunate that humanoid enemies can attack so quickly its impossible to react to and they can do weird shit like turn on the spot and instantly hit you even if your attack starts up first but thats just a problem with Bethesda not having a very good understanding of computer game melee combat in how they designed melee enemies.,fodust,d89vwoz,2,t5_38d47

Regarding Critical Hits Outside of VATS I dont seem to have any problem with it personally. For the beginning of Frost I suggest you dont go in the Sewers the Cannibals are really tough that early in your run. Go through the Subway lines and remember you can always outrun ghouls or sneak past them the ones in the Subway are damn near blind. ,fodust,d8di16x,1,t5_38d47

9647639,0,t3_5d5xeg,I dont like that the ripper is constantly on it doesnt make sense anyway. Theres a trigger on the model for a reason. When you attack with it it should turn on otherwise it shouldnt move. With that out of the way I would like to see the ripper have some balancing to it. Maybe add a malfunction chance for it or degradation system that needs to be brought back to Fallout especially FROST? Perhaps flamer fuel is consumed every time it is used? You could just have it be however much fuel you have in your inventory or someone could create an animation for the handle on it that IS a fuel tank and have ammo capacity for it. On the same note the shishkebab could have the same drawback or the electrifying mods for some melee weapons could use gamma rounds or fusion cells as ammo.,fodust,da29s9g,1,t5_38d47
