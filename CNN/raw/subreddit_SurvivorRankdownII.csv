Interesting way to look at it as a  dark story arc  I guess I can dig that from your perspective but the whole religion meets hypocrisy meets unstableness isnt really my cup of tea.  In my top  Id instead have Sundra Erica Brett Rick and others jokes jokes I do like interesting but interpret it differently.Im unlike dabu in that I dont have an actual list of my favorite Survivors not sure if he does but wouldnt be surprised p so I just used bottom  as a benchmark for where we are right now.  Id rank him probably somewhere in the s I think.   Honestly I couldve cut him or Sundra but felt like going for Brandon Hantz since Sundra got knocked out super early last time and I dont think she is the worst CI rep.   So we got Brandon instead.   Hell no was I eliminating Franny and like I said wanted to have other ASS people out other than Sue so went with Brandon because say no to hantz. ,SurvivorRankdownII,crw1dtw,2,t5_38gi7

4464278,0,t1_cste618,I dunno having just finished up my rewatch other than the finale for being remembered as one of the best casts ever Im surprised by how many really minoruninspiring characters it has. JeremiahAlexisJefra are basically nonentities DavidBriceCliffLindsey dont really get much for their short stays LJ is LJ I was surprised by Tasha not being too dynamic postGarrett Morgan is fun in the premiere and her boot but totally absent between them and Spencer is almost wholly ineffectual and spends roughly  of his air time making incredibly obvious observations. Thats  out of the  contestants and while some people might still find themselves rooting for a couple of them like me and Jefra... thats still a whole bunch of contestants who can be written off pretty easily without changing much of the season. Every season needs to have supporting characters but Cagayan has a lot and one of its major ones Spencer really doesnt have anything unique about him  I can accept that other people root for him for whatever reason because he was a superfan who gave expressive confessionals about The Game and that appeals to them but that still leaves all the others.

4643644,0,t3_3eeluc,. Kelley Who? Wentworth San Juan Del Sur th PlaceFor any Wentworth fans out there heres the rationale Im a big fan of Brian so I dont want to see him cut for a while.  Dawson is my own nomination and I kind of mildly like Katie Hanson even though I wouldnt care if somebody else cut her here.  And I just havent seen Vanuatu recently enough to do a writeup for Lisa Keiffer.  I can remember the bigger characters like Ami Eliza Scout Twila and Chris and even people like Sarge and Leann but people like Lisa are just completely gone from my memory.  So heres Kelley.In my last cut I said Kelley and Sydney should be kind of similar.  In theory Kelley should be more offensive since at least well never have to see Sydney be uninteresting and rarely appear on camera a second time.  And yet Ive never seen Sydney Wheeler appear in any discussion about anything while Kelley has a huge online fanbase.  Why?  I think what it boils down to is that as a model Sydney lacks the nerdy girl appeal that makes redditors go crazy. I guess its pretty obvious why Kelley is popular on reddit.  A nerdy yet attractive girl who uses reddit will always be a favorite see Jenn Brown.So Kelley is on the show for five episodes but I cant think of a time she even appears on screen in three of them.  Seriously is she even there before the Drew Christy episode?  She had a little bit of focus on her in the sumo challenge but other than that?  So thats three out five episodes in which she does nothing over half her time on the show.  She doesnt even get that much focus in the Drew Christy episode.  Drew calls her out as the mastermind and everybody is like Dude wtf are you talking about?  I think they were really trying to drive the Drew is stupid point home with that one.But after that episode you get all of Kelleys fans on reddit saying that Drew Christy is some sort of Survivor prophet and Kelleys going to slay everyone and win the game.  Nope. Shes voted out in the next episode because she let Jon know she wanted to vote him out but didnt actually vote him out.  Thats never a good idea.

4845553,1,t1_cu5a7a1,Oh sure.For me I get why he has fans. Like if you look past certain aspects of his personality like... most of them he can probably be funny and entertaining. But everything about him just repulsed me on a human level so much that I just cant get there. His treatment of Clarence felt like it was rooted in racism he was totally a misogynist and treated the women like lesser beings at every point his actions around Sues quit in AllStars was the lowest point of the entire series in my eyes he was pretending to dance on her grave after she left the game because she felt sexually violated and that is so many shades of fucked up. I have to admit hes a contender for my least fave contestant more because of AllStars but I thought he was awful even in Africa but more David Murphy level awful than Phillip Sheppard you know?. For me being a shitty person with some fun scenes thrown in doesnt make someone complex it just makes them awful but with some fun scenes thrown in to try and mask that a bit.

4999678,0,t3_3j6kfh, Kim Johnson Africa RunnerUpHad a Joe cut started and scrapped it because whatever I like him and he was really positive and the season needed as many people like him as it could get. Im not really even considering Richard because as much as he was a critical part to the awful AS incident that sucks I do arbitrarily think he wasnt intending to cause any harm and Im far more disgusted by the reaction to the incident by the other castaways than anything Richard himself did. And hes fucking epic otherwise in the season. And I cant cut the other two.So Kim. I cut her at  which is irrelevant to Kim Johnson who is the runnerup of Survivor Africa who I am cutting at . I look at Africa as a season with a lot of older people but its not really a totally accurate perception  with an average age of  its actually younger than the Panama cast where they put yearold women on the older women tribe. Kim at  isnt just a small footnote or a year or two older than the older people on Samburu shes a full decade older than anyone else out there and this fact comprises a large amount of her storyline.Kim was a badass for making it  days in such a brutally hard season and winning a final endurance challenge against two fit guys as a yearold woman. Ethan falls off because a cameraman throws up and Lex has stomach problems but its not like this invalidates her win especially considering all the other physical advantages they had over her. Its awesome Kim totally killed it out there especially at the end but it feels a little Lydia Moralesy where the shes still there awesome! storyline loses steam after a while.As a character Kim is a little bland. She isnt a great confessionalist and just has a really roundabout way of saying things which is on full display during Toms jury question and that TC where everyone gives normal answers about what they miss and she says the ability to be completely totally relaxed and at peace or something. She often sounds like that kid in a class trying to give an amazing answer to everything and coming off as annoying.Her imitating Clarence is awesome.Kim just feels like a really underdeveloped finalist to me in a season and era of developed characters. They spent miles of tape on the Boran boys especially Lex and Kim was just kind of there. What we got was pleasant but she isnt really someone I particularly care about when alls said and done even though I do think she deserves to rank this high.For my nomination I really think its time for Reed Kelly to go. It pains me to knock SJDS down to five but I think several that are gone should have outlasted him. Its a bunch of superUTR episodes followed by a sudden run of highvis gamebottiness and a vile jury speech. Hes fairly charismatic but I really dont dig him.uSlicer .

5975146,0,t1_cy2vbft,Ive been thinking a lot about this seasons editing today particularly while working on this list. Im not exactly the best at organizing my thoughts but here are a few isolated thoughts Ive had about the editing. The Final  Tribal Council was arguably the most exciting Tribal Council ever from a gameplay standpoint. But how much more exciting would it have been if wed had an emotional investment in it. I understand that the producers are terrified that the audience will revolt if someone they like is idoled out or eliminated as the result of a twist. And therefore they push those characters under the radar as much as possible. But as things stood here our only concern was Are we losing the comic relief or that woman whos been in the background all season?  Worse because we know that people who get idoled out get subdued edits there was no tension we all knew that Kimmi was gone. How much better would that whole scene have been if Kimmi had been a constant presence all season. I was a lot more okay with Purple Wiglesworth back when I figured that she was intentionally not giving production what they wanted. Then the more I saw of her in Ponderosa the less okay I became with it. And it only got even more disappointing after seeing her jury question. I liked that both Spencer and Jeremy had comparable edits because it made it harder to go This person is clearly the winner even going into the finale. But if you shave a bit of time away from both of them equally you keep that uncertainty while also allowing other characters to shine. And as an added bonus their reduced screentime would make Wentworth look even more like a winner possibility giving  possible winners going into the finale. Some of the better scenes this season were relegated to the secret scenes which just baffles me. Keiths confessional where he does a Joe impression Jeremy calling Spencer a nerd for memorizing the puzzle in advance Keith saying that he tunes out Jeff and the whole Juicy J scene! Look Im one of the strategy nuts who watches Survivor to see the game. I love watching the strategy and all that stuff in the season. But even I think that its possible to cut one or two of the This is a difficult decision! confessionals in favor of things like those scenes.,SurvivorRankdownII,cy2vfu3,3,t5_38gi7
6013666,0,t3_3xunyv,I cant remember what caused me to do it but I started rewatching Palau last weekend I think it was a Palau shoutout on the mothership because Ive only ever seen it once before when I was a kid.  And I loved Palau.  Its probably one of my three favorite seasons I havent seen them all just a ballpark of what I have seen.  And Ian is quite easily one of my three favorite characters ever.  Palau is just an amazing heartbreaking intense season.I think Tom was a character the show needed badly.  If we look at the seasons prior to it we had Chris Daughtery from Vanuatu who elicits feelings but wasnt really a hero of the story.  Rupert was probably the only thing even remotely close to a hero in Pearl Islands AllStars had exactly zero heroes within the context of that season the hero of Amazon got kicked out at the Final  and so on.  Not really since Kathy VOB barely or really just Ethan have we seen someone really be such a positive force in their season.  Toms run through Palau probably did more for the show than any other winner since Ethan since it really set the foundation for how winners can act and be portrayed.Toms a wonderfully amazing character and this was a great writeup.,SurvivorRankdownII,cy7x45z,1,t5_38gi7

8249615,0,t1_d58l624,I can definitely see Yul deserving to be higher. This is pretty much impossible and nobody should be too keen on ranking winners so Im glad youre not.He didnt really play in a real season and I didnt feel there was much to evaluate aside from he didnt screw up the game that was rigged for him so I figured last was as good as anything. He was at least decent socially within the group of four but someone also voted for someone they had never met to win over him so...,SurvivorRankdownII,d58raop,2,t5_38gi7

9031892,0,t3_53wdln,I enjoyed the premiere but I kinda with they gave a little unpopular opinion MORE focus on the cyclone. It seemed like oh no rain lets get out of here and less like HOLY POTATO WE ARE GOING TO DIE IF WE DONT LEAVE. I mean they said it but it seemed emotionally disconnected. Most all? of them dont live on the Atlantic coast making them vulnerable to the destructive power of hurricanes though so its understandable that they wouldnt understand how bad it is in the way I wouldnt understand an avalanche or tornado.Most of the characters surprised me some positively some negatively. So heres a preliminary ranking David David is the biggest picture of a personality we got early on. We can put that on having his head on the chopping block but its still great. Cant wait to see more of his paranoia. Sunday lt People were expecting her to be bossy and annoying and it seems Rachel filled that role well enough. Sunday seems like a genuinely nice person but not so nice she isnt willing to get her hands dirty. Probably have some winner pick bias here. Ken Ken is just an amazing person overall. Jessica Knew shed be cool as soon as she found that legacy advantage. Doubled when she called out David on his idol hunt. She was pretty hyped when the newspaper leaked her then fell off during her preseason interviews. I like her and hope she does well. ChaosJess? Adam Probst. Mari My initial idea of her overplaying seems to be incorrect. I really hope so shes pretty dang cool. Michelle Kinda crazy. I can dig it. Chris Hes pretty cool I guess. Paul Still think hes a bit too real with his personal antimillennial narrative but so far isnt looking like Dan Foley . which is a good thing. Rachel Fun first boot but could have been more OTT. Kinda wish she was but it is made up for by the misdirect with David. Will His beginning was alright but then he went invisible. Hannah Hannah is not Aubry is not Shirin. Dont like her too much but I like her more than the triforce. Lucy She was Purplucy but not raising her hand at tribal when Jeff asked who thought they might be going home shot her up instantly for me. Michaela Generally unseen but intro stankface rises her this high. Zeke  I really dont like Zeke especially his comment about hating the children on his tribe that dont have real careers and I belong at a Miami retirement community. Honestly it gave me Colton Cumbie vibes and that both scared and enthralled me. I loved Colton and hated Colton at the same time. Loved his mad power trip and the fact that he somehow managed to take control of the game and convince Bill to walk to his death. Hated everything about his personality and who he was and what he believed. The second half seemed like he could be different but Im unsure. I hope my comparison turns out incorrect. Jay Somethings a brewing in the cool kids alliance and it doesnt involve Jay. Figgy All honesty she gets the advantage over Taylor for two reasons. One is that Im a straight dude and shes pretty. I know Im sorry. Taylor The second and more prevalent reason is the sicky sicky gnar gnar dudebro lingo. Its really annoying and it exists in Jay also but the Next Time on Survivor section seems like there will be a showmance alienating Jay and making him turn on them. Bret Didnt notice him too much but dont dislike him. CeCe Didnt like her initial comments similarly to Pauls but he turned out to have a personality and she got the split votes. Meh.,SurvivorRankdownII,d7xho1a,1,t5_38gi7
9738024,0,t3_5elhkf,Wow I was kind of turning around on this season but that was great. Adam reading the letter from his mom and the raw emotion from it was incredible as well as the Davis content about his anxiety. The second was so exciting just to see the shifting dynamics and the mad scramble. I did love the BretZeke scene on the rewardbut we at the personal attacks against him at tribal. Blown away by the rock draw as well. Im actually genuinely excites for next week.,SurvivorRankdownII,dadf9xa,3,t5_38gi7

9979750,0,t3_5ifgmu,Number . Cece boringNumber . Rachel forgettableNumber . Paul underwhelmingNumber . Lucy silenceNumber . Mari maybe couldve been interesting but she was relegated to pushing the theme constantly and had very little else about her.Number . Will He tried too hard in his confessionals and didnt seem genuine. His downfall was too obvious but not entertaining enough to redeem it.Number . Sunday I thought shed be a bigger character but she ended up being UTR the entire game while Bret and Chris got airtime instead.Number . Chris He was fun in challenges when he was just murdering people but he wasnt as interesting as I thought he would be.Number . Michelle She was great in Episode  but she basically disappeared after that and we got no dragon talk on the show.Number . Hannah David did it better. She just annoyed me for most of the game and she introduced trust clusters which brings her down even more for me.Number . Zeke Another underwhelming character. I did kinda like him as a narrator and the Bret scene was great but his downfall was pretty weak.Number . Figgy Anyone who writes Figgys name down goes home. She was an annoying premerge villain but in a good way. She boosted Michaela and Taylor as characters and was solid herself by just laying everything out there with Taylor and Michelle.Number . Jessica r.obbedrocked goddess. Its funny that someone as inoffensive as Jessica raised so much hell between the GenXers and just as it looked as if she escaped the rock rips the floor out from under her.Number . Taylor hes good with mason jars. I didnt know if Id love or hate him for most of the season but his boot episode solidified my love for this character. He was a great contrast between Jay still being appreciated despite being on the bottom and Taylor just pissing everyone off for being an idiot. Number . Bret despite being nothing in the premerge Bret was the standout in the postmerge for me. His subplot of getting drunk all the time was muchneeded with the few character moments elsewhere. He was  sick of everyones bullshit by the end and left us a Keithlike force present in the game.Number . Michaela From being introduced in Episode  to her boot Michaela was the star of the season. She was a beast in challenges and was so good she helped other tribes win too. Her exit was instantly iconic and is a great origin story for whats coming next season.Number . Ken He wouldve been number one at the merge but he was surpassed by simply better characters. Ken was a unique player in that hes a stud who simply is just different than everyone else. He went off the map in his life and it shows in his early struggle to connect with people. Hes a flawed golden boy who was beat by the game itself.Number . Adam First winner I was shocked by in a while but in a good way. Adam had flaws as a player but he was able to correct it after a brutal time early in the merge. Hes awful at apologizing but good at keeping his allies loyal. His heartbreaking story made his win even more satisfying.Number . David Despite being overexposed premerge his growth into the power player of the postmerge with many wannabe power players was excellent and so much more genuine than that of Cochrans. Not only did he grow but he was the biggest threat from F and made it all the way to F. Even though he didnt win he was a great player with a great story.Number . Jay Easily the best character of the season for me. Jay was introduced as the bro counterpart to Taylor with Figgy and Namaste Michelle. He proves early on to be much more competent than Taylor in every aspect. Hes a provider to his tribe and is aware to the game being played unlike Taylor. Hes always a positive presence as a guy whos just happy to be in the jungle. His story doesnt truly take off until the Michaela boot where he turns heel. This move fails as he falls into the minority immediately at the merge. From there he fights from the bottom and outlasts all of his alliance despite being the biggest target. He does all of this with his strange relationship with Adam forming and giving us one of the most powerful scenes in recent memory. Hes gracious in defeat and leaves as the positive presence he was throughout the game.,SurvivorRankdownII,db8e1gn,1,t5_38gi7
10109156,0,t1_dbo2tgn,Witches Coven is one of my five least favorite episodes in Survivor history.It didnt genuinely disgust me like Outraged Rice Wars Persona Non Grata and Russian Roulette. But it still frustrated the hell out of me. It was boring predictable and a perfect example of awful editing amp storytelling that basically summed up my problems with Cambodia and a good amount of modern Survivor seasons.I just wanted to scream SHOW! DONT TELL!,SurvivorRankdownII,dbp8fe5,3,t5_38gi7
