Considering were still at the halfway mark its early. But if this campaing lasts real life years it could be logical.  In Luffys case he is going to be a Yonko before he becomes the Pirate King. Whether he likes it or not when he takes his first Yonko down hell be reckoned as a Yonko. Its like the stepping stone for him.
