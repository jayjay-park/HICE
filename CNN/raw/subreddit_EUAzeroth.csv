5814826,0,t1_cxhvlbd,Ahhh thats true. Yeah I think Horde might be a better option since it looks like the Alliance is getting it handed to them in Legion.,EUAzeroth,cxhvt1j,1,t5_3b2rt

7561173,0,t1_d31llad,A wowtoken? Terminology Ive not came across lol.. I managed to get some prices for my lock making things a fair bit easier.. Got shoulders robe and staff. All I could afford atm but as soon as I get to  I just spam dungeons alongside questing and ye fly through the levels.. Its the  that pisses me off lol taking my time now though experiencing the game like I never did previous.,EUAzeroth,d31o3dx,1,t5_3b2rt
8723239,0,t1_d6w02l2,How come you arent  mythic already if its completely irrelevant nerfed old content? You should obviously be selling mythic archimonde runs if its so easy that you cant possibly use any content to trial people.,EUAzeroth,d6w1o36,-2,t5_3b2rt
9021071,0,t1_d7ufauz,Well EPGP seems like the obvious way to go for non toplevel guilds for overall loot distribution DKP is still heavily dependant on officer calls and such it can be quite obviously unfair to people and rightfully so.,EUAzeroth,d7w6wiw,1,t5_3b2rt
9711292,0,t3_5e09ei,How I feel. New officers less is more. New loot council less is more. Monitor players performance and help them improve . Mythic Progress weve outgeared HC. New raid leader. Transparency between officersplayers on current issues. Xeixeis point on casual and progress is good. New Guild Leader I dont know how others feel about this but its strange not having one who actually plays the game.No point really going in to detail as I seem to agree with the majority of people on these points and Id just be reiterating their statements.,EUAzeroth,daa4jbl,2,t5_3b2rt
