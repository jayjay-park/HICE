A lot of the time it looked like you were just blindly swinging nairs while he was on the other side of the stage mis spacing bairs fishing for forward smashes etc. so maybe work on spacing. You also only used Speed and missed an opportunity to hold on to your first stock with Shield. Incorporate more Monado Arts into your playstyle. I like Jump a lot for juggles and edgeguards and if I get the stock lead Buster comes out etc.,ShulkMains,cz3lrzu,2,t5_39baj
