2600903,0,t1_cmxjy1u,What makes you think you could ever get near  via radiolysis? It takes a pretty strong radiation flux to generate a significant amount of hydrogen. Obviously the superhigh radiation flux environment of a nuclear reactor can do it but even then it isnt produced at an alarming rate so I would have to wonder what kind of source could potentially produce enough to reach an explosive concentration. Have you done the calculation for the rate that hydrogen will be produced? For example gamma radiolysis has a gfactor of about half a molecule of H per  eV deposited about E molJ. Co radiates a little less than  watts per gram and has an activity of  curies per gram. So to get  mole with a big  curie Co source it would take about  months assuming no scavenging goes on.,nuclear,cmy2qde,1,t5_2qkcl

3963588,0,t3_35utxa,In theory you could since undermoderated means the displacement of water is a reactivity subtraction however it wouldnt necessarily be very efficient. Given that you have a finite amount of space in a Reactor core and you have to consider fuel loading for a fairly long fuel cycle current LWRs operate for  months on the same core I would rather use control rods that absorb neutrons since that allows me to load a core with more fuel.  Plus Im a stickler for safety and its definitely safer to have more neutron absorbers available to shut down the reactor.,nuclear,cr82z8z,5,t5_2qkcl

Not sure on the economics but Id venture that combined with the long plant lifetime power sales and fees for disposal it would be a worthwhile venture. Guess I could of out right said it but this is my original point.   Although its not part of their plan with relatively  minor changes they could burn down reprocessing waste for power and alter the entire landscape of handling nuclear spent fuels.  Their current plan puts them much closer than anyone else to that option. ,nuclear,cxqu938,2,t5_2qkcl

There is still a lot of energy left in a fuel bundle after  months you can extract that energy by mixing new and used fuel bundles in different arrangements. As others have stated  the military is allowed to use fuel concentrations that are much higher than commercial reactors.They limit the concentration of fuel for commercial purposes so we dont have to worry about someone building a nuclear bomb if they get a hold of some fuel. ,nuclear,cy6u5e8,1,t5_2qkcl

7913819,0,t3_4no37x,gt The last of it will be buried in the s and the tunnels will be permanently sealed. After  years the nuclear waste will no longer be radioactive or dangerous.Ive never understood this idea that because the waste has a long life the storage facility must have an equally long life WITHOUT MAINTENANCE.  Literally nothing else that we do as a species is expected to work that way!  Take the example of a skyscraper.  If we build skyscrapers with the same expectations as we have from waste disposal sights we would expect it to stand without a shred of maitenance indefinately.  Of course skyscrapers that meet such a requirement cant be built... they need constant on going maitenance or they will collapse... just like all other human technology.  Now for skyscrapers we have no problem building despite the certain knowledge that if abandonded for long enough they will become unstable and dangerous to even be near.  So why would the idea that a nuclear waste site would become dangerous if abandonded for long enough cause people to become so unsettled?  Why does waste disposal need to be walkaway safe for an extended period of time?  Why isnt walkaway safe for a century at a time sufficient?
