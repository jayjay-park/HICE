428135,0,t1_cfolkos,So from what I hear these standardized tests are more about testing the school than testing the kid.  I think thats worth keeping in mind because Im not aware of dire consequences associated with not doing well on the tests.The broader concern seems to be schools teaching to the test rather than giving a good education.  I see no easy way out of this problem.  People want accountability out of schools meaning that you have to have some way to  measure what theyre doing and see if theyre any good.  But fundamentally measuring how schools are doing is really hard many reasons why you can look them up online if you want a discussion on that.So we cant let schools get away with no accountability but all of this testing to get the accountability also sucks but for different reasons.  What to do?    Theres no solution to this problem  its a situation that just has to be managed over a long period of time.Heres my .  parents are justified in complaining about schools and trying to make them as good as they can be BUT parents who delegate the entirety of their kids education to public schools are crazy.  Its hard work to educate a child and you cant entirely hand it over to a school system.  The parent has to do educational stuff with the kid over a period of years.  Let the schools teach reading writing and arithmetic.  No matter how many standardized tests there are the schools are going to get this done.  But the parents remain responsible for the kids education.   Yelling at teachers and counties and acting like they bear this sole responsibility seems to leave everyone unhappy.Teachers and schools seem to me to be responding to the incentives they have in front of them.  They dont necessarily agree with national policy but they dont have the flexibility to change it.,RVADads,cfp53q8,1,t5_3085a

In fact it may help keep their attitude positive about the chores unlike the effects of a good scolding or persistent nagging. The real test comes when they say to you that they really dont want to do the chore and will forego the reward.  They should not get out of work so easy as that.  Carrot and stick figurative mind you might be a good plan.  Chores are rewarding but refusing chores is unpleasant.,RVADads,cjgi1tw,1,t5_3085a
