That is unless youre viper who are using the .L engine or BMW...which confirms to none of these rules what so ever. GTD are basically GT cars which means theyre closer to tube frame versions of the cars they look like but are almost as fast as GTLM cars on the banking because they have no down force.

199320,0,t1_cf13so4,Woah now IndyCar making the least bad decisions? Where have you been?The reason we have had such shitty times over the past  years is because time and time again the organizations that are there to give us fans pure racing have let us down time and time again. Looking at this year I can understand why I have ZERO friends in real life that like any of these sports. Rule changes splitting merging new cars better cars homogenization changes to formats all are just management decisions made because the world we live in demands entertainment. NASCAR implementing knockout chase format  NASCAR implementing group qualifying even at Martinsville Bristol NASCAR giving Jeff Gordon a chase spot after Richmondgate Formula  with their stupid safety noses and vanity panels USCR With their delayed homogenization and terrible BoP IndyCar for firing Randy Bernard a year ago IndyCar refusing to go back to Las Vegas USCR for making an exception for DeltaWingDisagree with some of those all you want but tell me what other sport has drastically changed their basic rules year after year. Tell me what other sport grants exceptions changes and individual adjustments quite like our top motorsport governing bodies. It is a terrible image for us fans to explain to others. If the NFL or MLB changed a rule equivalent to some of the stuff or sanctioning bodies have done they would see an uproar the likes the world has never seen. Honestly the ACO is surprisingly the best run racing organization out there right now. I am almost voting WEC to the top of my favorite sporting series.,USCR,cf1580d,3,t5_2wm51

1786105,0,t3_2eyv83,Let me guess whats going on here. HPD may or may not actually have customers for the  cars. We know that Strakka and Andretti wont be buying as Strakka is collabalorating with Dome and Andretti just said he isnt interested. Starworks has silver rated guys who want to run P Class but they already have like  DP chassis and HPD support for a HPDRiley DP. Star already helps OAK run its Morgan and its Ligier and has  DPs and an ARXb.Maybe... Team Sahlen? They have the cash and the drivers but wanted to sit out the first season.Another possibility is Greg Pickett. He has a small fortune with selling CytoSport and all. Could we see a return of Pickett Racing with GrafLuhr? Im guessing no as both drivers now race elsewhere.Another possibility is Sam Schmidt running a car alongside his indycar team. Then you have Tracy Krohn but that would be WEC...We know ESM bought  cars and they are going to race... Somewhere.Ok here is what I think will really happenESM  cars NAEC and WEC with select TUSC racesTeam Sahlen  car full TUSC COTA WEC onlyStarworks  car full TUSCKrohn Racing  car DaytonaPetit full WEC or ELMS with Le MansStar buy a car and ride shop it out,USCR,ck4ai50,1,t5_2wm51
1930861,0,t3_2gjgbj,Rolex   The best value unless youre springing for elite seatsexperiences is the Ultimate Endurance Package or what used to be called that.  Now its just the  day ticket and it was a bracelet this year instead of a ticket that you put in the DIS lanyard.  Its  may be  next year and you get garage access.  Definitely a great deal.  If you dont want to have to walk back outside the track to get to your coolerswhatever you can carry with you buy infield parking now because it will be gone WELL IN ADVANCE of January .  If you can make the CTSCC race on Friday definitely do it.  Total shit show.  So many people that go out there and think they can race and then make a mess of it.  Some Civics and Camaros and stuff tried to go  wide into Turn  off the banking at the drop of the green last year you can probably guess that didnt go so well.Next year will be interesting accesswise because of the Daytona Rising construction.  Im hoping they leave the grandstands above the pit exit  turn  on the road course open.   This is where I like to start my race.  Its nice and warm out you get a good tan more importantly have a view of everything except the bus stop basically the entire infield and the pits and the sound is good but not bothersome.  One of the frustrating things about Daytona right now is that the speakers are generally awful.  Unless you have race radio with an MRN feed dont expect to be able to hear Eli or whoever is on at the time unless theres a caution out.  Im also hoping that improves with the redesign.  VIRs audio completely changed my worldview on what a circuit could have speakers wise.After a couple hours up in the main stand I like to head to the infield for a bit.  There are bleachers setup at the Intl and West Horseshoes as well as the Kink and along the infield straight.  Theres also good places to stand along turns  and  so you can really get a feel for the banking and the speed.I like to try to grab dinner at around  Ive always only had a car never camped because theres an Outback right across the street from the track and by then it starts to die down.  They always have the race on there and also you can hear the cars possibly even louder than they are in the infield in the bathrooms because of the ducting.  Its actually quite bizarresurreal.  Youre almost a mile away and yet feel like youre sitting in the first row of the grandstand.At around whenever I leave Outback I like to go watch the bus stop until they close the party porch at midnight.  I think this is my biggest complaint about the Rolex.  So much happens in the bus stop and yet as a fan you can only access it for  of the race.  I dont know whats going to happen when they level the backstretch grandstand.  I wish theyd put in more video boards.  They usually only have  overhead at the exit of the infield and  on ground level in the Sprint fan zone.  There are places for  for the  and I wish theyd use them all maybe even leave one permanently on the bus stop.  I love the Rolex though.  Ive been going for the past  years now  its been a dream of mine to attend and maybe one day compete in it since I was a kid watching the old Riley amp Scott Mk III  Ferrari  SP battles in the race during the s.

6723626,0,t1_d0eocw2,BoP is the only thing keeping teammfr budgets somewhat controlled.  If it were an open rulebook costs would be orders of magnitude higher.  Theres a saying that racing is the only sport in which it is possible to directly buy performance.  And its true.And what does BoP really do?  It lets engines and cars of various configurations compete within a certain window.  Yes IMSA screws up some weights and restrictor sizes but before organized BoP each car was allowed different modifications in order to compete.  Isnt that just another form of BoP?  If there was no BoP when you boil it down classes like GTLM and GTD would essentially morph into Prototype over time.  After all isnt that sorta how the Prototype class began all those ages ago anyway?  Just prolonged rules creep into something that doesnt look like the car it was based on. ,USCR,d0es4xb,10,t5_2wm51

8652488,0,t1_d6n5q0u,gt Again if Porsches design for the car makes it take longer to attach the fuel hose why is that the series job to remedy? Thats a car design problem.Imagine a car had rear wheel covers like the old GTP Jaguars and that meant they took an extra s to change tires. Should IMSA give them s worth of BoP to speed them up and catch the rest of the pack to offset their design decision?Thats a really bad example.  All of the teams are required to have a restrictor in the fueling hose to equalize the fueling times.  Its IMSAs stated goal to have all the cars fuel in a certain amount of time.  The Porsche is currently closest to that target time.  All the other cars fuel  seconds faster than the Porsche even when you disregard the additional time to attach the fuel hose which lets face it IMSA isnt ever going to take into consideration so we can just get over it. How is that fair?  IMSA has failed in their stated goal here and so far hasnt done anything to correct it.,USCR,d6n6aq0,1,t5_2wm51
