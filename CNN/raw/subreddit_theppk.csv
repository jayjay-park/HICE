She was waiting for a bus with folks and this cat walks up waits for the bus then jumps on with protests from the bus driver. But Dauntless just walked straight on to the back of the bus and sat in a chair. C was worried that he might be hurt because he obviously had no fear of buses or cars. So she went up to him and he kinda jumped in her bookbag so she took him off the bus and home.,theppk,d9313cl,2,t5_3gvr7

9497628,0,t1_d9b64n0,I used to be registered with a doctor like that. There was a national target for everyone to be able to see the doctor within two weeks of booking the appointment so in order to meet the target they simply wouldnt let you book appointments in advance you had to phone up when they opened in the morning and try to get an emergency sameday one bnut of course those went really quickly. I dont know how anyone with a Monday to Friday job ever got to see the doctor if they couldnt book a half days leave in advance.Then I moved and the new doctor could book appointments up to a month or so in advance so for longer term conditions I could see the doctor at a time that suited me be told to come back for a review in four weeks and book that appointment with the receptionist on the way out! As far as I remember unless it was for a specialist area that only a particular doctor could deal with they could give appointments within a few days usually.And they still let you phone up in the morning and book emergency appointments that day or the next day if they had run out of spaces. Ive just moved so have registered with a new GP and forgot to even ask about this. Hopefully it is still easy to get an appointment.,theppk,d9js9kd,1,t5_3gvr7

10135046,0,t1_dbrper0,Dogs are transported in small kennels but it is the safest way for them to be transported. Ideally a dog should always be in a crate when in a car but most people dont do that. Unrestrained dogs are live projectiles in an accident and the seatbelt solutions for them are only soso also. These dogs would all be crate trained and typically find being in the kennels relatively low stress.I cant weigh in on anything else but I had to touch on the crate comment. ,theppk,dbsln3a,1,t5_3gvr7

10305758,0,t1_dcb8npk,gt I typically do leftovers. Sometimes it is a full portion from dinner the night before sometimes it is leftovers from the freezer I typically freeze in single serve portions so I have grab and go lunches on days when there are no leftovers and sometimes a smaller amount of leftovers and a good sized salad.This is what I do. Most recipes I use make an insane amount of food I live alone so  servings of something will last me two days and so most of the time I have Dinner Part II for lunch.
