4303228,0,t3_3a9foh,If you like DiggleJock and you dont mind a little less on the superhero side check out The Losers by both of them. Its only two books so the entire story is covered and its really well done.,GreenArrow,csap5pp,1,t5_2ugeq
4501959,0,t1_csy2xui,I read the first issue. It was fun nothing serious. Havent read this weeks though.  Probably a fringe one where if youre tight on money its an easy one to drop. I wonder if theyd bring all three together at any point. All three books are completely different styles. ,GreenArrow,csy4i40,1,t5_2ugeq

5438364,0,t1_cw6snx1,Is it ever! Its heavy but definitely built it for mobility. Had no trouble moving around with it. Probably somewhere around  lbs altogether. My buddy Justin who was the Deathstroke you see here was wearing a metal Roman cuirass so his was around  lbs maybe more.  But its nice to wear them to hear nice comments so thank you!

7436311,0,t1_d2nga0j,gtthose seasons were absolute shitIf youre looking for The Wire or Breaking Bad yes it is complete shit. The show was good to me as was The Flash. The Flash isnt amazingly acted but its still a fun ride. And this is possibly the only Green Arrow we will get in live action so Ill take it.Deathstroke wasnt a friend. They were together on the island as friends but later in S he becomes a villain because he went insane and Oliver betrayed him. Also this is supposed to be a young Deathstroke and a young Oliver Queen. In the comics. Oliver is like  and in here he is still . These are liberties they take with the characters and if you hate it that much I wonder how you feel watching Nolan trilogy or BvS.Just think of it as an elseworld story.,GreenArrow,d2nglm3,2,t5_2ugeq
7702952,0,t3_4kpoos,. I loved the show when it was good and even in season  it had amazing episodes that played with the idea of Oliver being  good guy instead of a bad one and in the first half of the series the Olicity stuff was perfect. Season  is the low point I hope the writers realise that.. I love Stephen Amell he isnt the Green Arrow from the comics but the show is what got me into the comics so I like the dark brooding Oliver the first season was very much like Grells run on screen.. I love the character of Diggle the put him into the New  in a good way and I hope that they keep him just as a normal guy.. I love the rest of the Arrow family Dinah being one of my favourite female character ever and one of my favourite characters as well only beaten by Ray in Star Wars and Shado.. I hate the Felicity fans they abuse Stephen Amells wife by saying he should be with felicity sending them death threats because they are destroying their OTP. They cabt tell life from fiction... the worst part... the writers listen to them.. I hate the writers of the show as someone who is doing a Media Production course and who knows about how to write a story and characters I can say the show is a poorly written sexist show where a female can do no wrong.. I want comic Green Arrow I want the Oliver that married Dinah Lance I want the Oliver that is not  and CW hot. . I think Stephen Amell could pull off an older version of the character like he has on Legends of Tomorrow but I think if I really wanted an older Green Arrow Ewan McGregor would be perfect.,GreenArrow,d3hrvxs,5,t5_2ugeq
