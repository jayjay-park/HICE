467495,0,t1_cftdupj,Thanks for the reply. Im a young husband caring for a young wife who suffers from chronic pain and gastrointestinal problems that is undiagnosed. Weve been to a million doctors and no one knows what it is. We think it may be chronic lyme but we arent sure. We also have good days and bad days. We rarely make plans in advance and when we do I try not to get my hopes up because usually she ends up being in too much pain to leave the house. Ive had some anger and resentment to deal with and its been rough. I feel guilty for being angry at her frustrated when we disagree about how to pursue treatment etc. and I am just learning to cope with them. Do you have any advice about how to keep our relationship healthy? Do you go to a support group? I want to be the best partner I can be and I do worry that her illness will affect our relationship negatively. Thanks in advance for your advice.,caregivers,cftem7c,1,t5_2un8d

8506658,0,t3_4w2bko,Hi from the ICU . Im a little too tired to say much but wanted to say hi and glad you found the sub. I also frequently think about care in terms of being the person I want to be thats a really interesting common thread it seems.As for your mom if she was a great mom before shes probably projecting her selfanger on to you.  Do you both ever talk about her illness if she carries guilt about it or other emotionally charged issues?  It really sounds like she needs therapy to come to terms with her life.  Not all chronically ill people are bitter and lashing out at those who  help so dont accept it as normal or acceptable. Maybe start by talking to her and then move to her PCP if shes unwilling to start having a conversation about it.,caregivers,d64vyis,2,t5_2un8d
