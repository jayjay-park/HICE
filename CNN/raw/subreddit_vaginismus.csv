687469,0,t1_cgidxm3,I agree we can have other sex besides PIV and I do with my gf when Im with her.  However its not as much as Id like.  She knows this and she says she wants to do more but she says a lot of things.  Ive never done anything sexual with anyone else but her.  Ive always wanted to have a beautiful gf who loves me as much as I love her and to have an amazing sexual relationship with.  She says the same thing.  But there isnt much exploration or new experiences.  We rarely have phone sex or sext or send pictures because shes uncomfortable with it or is tired.  Yes Im subscribed to deadbedrooms.  I lived with her one summer and I can count the number of times we were intimate on one hand.  I just feel like if were not gonna be having PIV sex then we should be doing other things often.  Especially since I dont see her all the time.  It sucks visiting her and shes not all over me like I am with her.  It can be tough on my self worth and the way I think of myself.Sorry this is long winded.  I just had to type it out I guess.  I dont have other people to talk to besides my gf and shes kind of tired of talking about it.,vaginismus,cgif0kf,1,t5_2vz6k

I really hope I have the motivation myself to stick with it.I know financials worry you. In my experience mine falls under regular PT with my insurance and I pay  copay per visit  hour session. Learning about my muscles asking questions having the external accountability and having a knowledgable person to talk to and provide emotional support have been invaluable to me.

2899086,0,t1_cn75lxj,I was given lidocaine. My physical therapist did the qtip test and it hurt SOOO bad with her barely touching me. Now my new doctor thinks I have vulvodynia and she can treat it. Except Im not pregnant only because of lidocaine and it still hurts. So I have to wait until after I deliver my new doc thinks its bad enough that I should get a csection. But she believes there are tests she can do to confirm before treatment. More than what my physical therapist did.Honestly its all about finding doctors who know enough about it. Some dont believe there is because they dont look at new research. I dont know what all the procedures are about this new found hope my new doctor has but I will be sure to update the world.Please just look around for a new doctor.,vaginismus,cnxmqpg,1,t5_2vz6k

This is the first time Ive ever been able to do that even though Ive had painful sex a few times in the past.  Although it didnt feel great since I wasnt turned on I think my goal for next month will probably be figuring out how to masturbate using my hands rather than my vibrator it slipped in.  And I didnt freak out.  So Im pretty happy right now.,vaginismus,comtq9c,1,t5_2vz6k

My wife has now finally bought the kit and books from the same website I hope they work. Although we found after a recent event of coupling using a small vibe to tease her to distraction that I was able to penetrate her half of myselfI am average inches without any pain. I am in hopes now but suggest fully patience is a must you cannot rush this. Now I hope that with some help and support I can get past some insecurities myself. I am afraid that my wife wont find me to be enough once she learns what shes been missing during her adult life. BTW I am husband . WeI have had our issues but have remained together this whole time. I will create a post soon as I figure out how to for updates. We never would have had children an accident I had in my youth.

4768817,0,t3_3g3axd,Try to get back into dilating its good for you and I think itll make you feel better and more knowledgeable about the status of your vaginismus.  Second of all I avoided dating for quite awhile because of my vaginismus.  The reality is Ive only had one guy be less than kind sympathetic and patient about it.  The guy who was less so honestly wasnt even that bad.  Looking back he was the first guy I ever had to tell about vaginismus so I was nervous and didnt do a good job.  I absolutely recommend you get out there and try some dating.  I also recommend strongly that you work out in advance how you want to talk to a new guy about vaginismus.  I had a little speech worked out that I improved as time went on.  It really made me feel better.  Make sure to let a guy know that its not permanent and if youre happy to be sexual in other ways that you can do that.  Guys arent quite as scary as I thought and Im sure they wont be for you either ,vaginismus,ctvnijv,2,t5_2vz6k

5914793,0,t3_3w8yte,Sorry to hear this! I used to wish my husband wasnt into sex at all that would make my life easier I had thought. But really it would be so lonely and I could tell its really hurtful from your words. I know if we didnt have sex often my condition wouldnt be progressing so I can see your frustration. IF its because hes embarrassed about how long he lasts he could try ejaculating a little bit before you guys have sex? Maybe have some  minutes to an hour before you actually want vaginal penetration sexy time but once he cums just keep the excitement going. ,vaginismus,cxuymf9,1,t5_2vz6k
6028155,0,t1_cy8l69o,Thank you so much for this thoughtful reply!Is there a difference between vaginismus and the anxiety youre describing that you think might make sex painful for me?  I assumed it was the same thing.I have continued with penetration practice and things are going very well.  Yesterday I used a .cm diameter x .cm makeup brush handle after a tampon and it went in totally smoothly.  Today I did a tampon the first makeup brush and one slightly larger at cm x .cm and still no issues!  Theres no pain at all maybe only . at the entrance until I get the angle right but onwards there isnt even discomfortpressure like before.  I go at a slow even pace and do kegals during this.I guess my problem is that Im so new to this that I dont know whats normal.  Theres still a LOT of exploring I need to do but I read threads on here about girls never having tampon trouble or using dilators twice as big as this and  fingers yet still having painful sex.  And Im not comfortable doing any thrusting with these objects.  I can see how this could be pleasurable but its very clinical right now and still feel abnormal for a  y.o...  I have no idea how much presex practice is normal for a virgin or how large an object should be before I can confirm I dont have vaginismus... seems like most girls finger at a young age and go straight to dildos.  ,vaginismus,cy9t81w,1,t5_2vz6k
6515058,0,t3_42uvmt,Im in a similar position as you and I too decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought the Berman Center Intimate Basics dilator set off drugstore.com because it was  for  sizes and the hard plastic it is made out of is quite body safe Im picky about that. Silicone would have been ideal but Im kind of broke although hard and inflexible.  I got it at the end of October and have been using it almost every day from mins up to hrs if im watching a movie and its a size im comfortable with. With the third size . diameter . length Ive gotten past the point of it being totally comfortable even with thrusting and moving it around and I just started working on the th and final size . diameter . length so YES it is definitely possible!

Im new to the community so Id thought Id introduce myselfI was diagnosed with vaginismus and vulvodyna in February and I was prerscribed lidocaine antidepressants and a dilator set. However after two months of barely being able to insert a qtip and interning abroad for the summer I got discouraged and put it off until the end of the summer when I had my followup appt with my gyn clinic. The medications have reduced my outer pain but the muscles inside my vagina are still very tight and painful. My doc hand I agreed that I should start physical therapy since dilating by itself wasnt working for me. tldr Im starting PT on Wednesday for primary vaginismus. Any advice or just some idea of what Im in for? ,vaginismus,d8clwr7,1,t5_2vz6k
9305939,0,t3_57qdz4,Glass dilatorsVaginal dilators are often the first attempt at treating vaginismus for those women who are able to tolerate some penetration. Many companies make them but typically as you get to the larger sizes the dilators are made too long and protrude from the vagina. The glass dilators are all the same length   inches the average depth of the vagina which allows the woman to be mobile during dilation and range in size from the  about the size of the index finger to  s  and  are the usual sizes needed to progress to intercourse.  and  is helpful for women with larger partners.These dilators can be ordered from Crystal Delights.com Understanding how to dilate is explained by linking toI will try to monitor this post if there are questions.

10062660,0,t3_5jtket,Yep yep aaaand yep. Tragically everything youre saying sounds like pretty normal frustrations with this issue I dont have time to respond to everything you said so Ill just share a few pointers. Its not all in your head. Thats just what people say when they dont understand any of this. You cant just concentrate on relaxing and make the problem go away. I wasnt abused or anything either but after seeing a bazillion docs weve come to the conclusion that my subconscious mental hang up is strongly related to all the messages I got about sex being bad and abstinence being good when I was growing up. My biggest breakthrough has been finding a shrink whos helping me work through those engrained ideas and embrace the idea of sex. I feel more ok after talking to her for a couple months than I have in... years. Im not better yet but it finally feels like I could be and Im not anxious amp angry all the time like I was. Do yourself a favor and stop trying to make sense of it  There is no why. It just sucks and this is your crucible. Marijuana is amazing for muscle relaxation. Really. I cant recommend it enough. It also has a side effect of making me horny lol which has been a huge help since I had zero positive sexual experiences to pull from before. I still cant do PIV but for the first time in ever Im enjoying sexual things.Hope that helps. I know its really really hard  come back here any time.,vaginismus,dbj6swh,6,t5_2vz6k
10285086,0,t3_5n8jmk,I know its a weird feeling but are you sure that youre putting it all the way in?  Also are you inserting it at the right angle for your body?  That makes a difference for me.  ,vaginismus,dc9vdf0,3,t5_2vz6k
10336021,0,t3_5nwum7,Wow Im glad they helped you!Ive never heard of injections with lidocaine before are you able to enjoy PIV at all with those? Are they expensive? Did insurance cover them? Do they last for a while?,vaginismus,dcfn9gp,2,t5_2vz6k
10351798,0,t3_5o7j3w,I get it. Im almost  and I still cant have casual sex. Its hard enough with a boyfriend. Ive even done the stop explain and compromise but they usually get frustrated and peace out and to be quite honest it can be even harder when theres someone there as sometimes the brain translates frustration as hes tired of waiting for me. A female physical therapist who basically fingers me every week we joke about this a lot yoga vibrators dilators and a plain ol dildo is about all you can do. you just have to stick with it. put it on your calendar think of it like a chore like brushing your teeth. A lot of advice here is try to feel sexy and relax but honestly nothing about dilating is sexy or relaxing for me so i go at it like its just another yoga exercise or chore and put on some tv and drink some wine beforehand. I honestly cant imagine seeing myself enjoying any kind of penetrative sex after this but since its almost impossible to find a hetero relationship that doesnt involve piv I guess thats just how it is. Its a shitty situation that were unlucky to have but it is what it is.,vaginismus,dchfq7v,5,t5_2vz6k
10397186,0,t3_5oth4e,Have you tried masturbating beforehand? It doesnt seem to be that popular with everyone but it helps relax the muscles down there and open everything up.

10565042,0,t1_dd5a0qi,Ive been to two ob gyns and they basically said to just use more lube during sex. Ive had pap smears done and visual examinations and everything seems to be normal. I thought maybe it wasnt vaginismus since some people say they experience really sharp pain or they cant even insert the dilators. In my situation I can insert them and its just a burning sensation.

10852201,0,t3_5v279u,Hey there! Unfortunately the journey to cure vaginismus can be a bit of an open ended ordeal but not always. For example some people including myself get so far with treatment but then relapse I.E have to go back to smaller dilators then work up again but then there are many people who find they get from A to B and only need to go through their process once. As for dilators I believe there is no single way to use them! Some people leave them in for  minutes at a time some people leave them in for hours at a time whilst relaxing and doing things they enjoy  and others might work on moving the dilators in and out and getting comfortable with that.I hope thats of some help and feel free to message me anytime ,vaginismus,ddzbt0y,1,t5_2vz6k
11174295,0,t3_5zh1gq,Try some pointtrigger releaseat least I think this is what its called. You can use the tip of the dilator to roll gently along the are where it burns. Use plenty of lube and hold the tip of the dilator against areas where it burns rolling and stretching slowly. Go clockwise and anti clockwise. It will burn as you do this but the pain will subside the more times you massage the area this way. I find that visualization helps me a great deal too. Imagine the dilator sliding in smoothly and your walls velvety and soft with no tightness. Telling myself that everything was fine and it wasnt going to hurt helped. ,vaginismus,deyle3m,2,t5_2vz6k

A big part of the treatment is learning how to gain control of the muscles down there so you can unclench at will. Dialators are just tools to help your body remember how far it can stretch.Id get the vaginismus.com kit when you can and in the meantime do lots of hip opening poses in yoga deep squat childs pose etc.,vaginismus,dgexsi4,2,t5_2vz6k
