It does appear later on its position in the list seems determined because the events of the book happen over a long time frame. Given some thought Ill agree that you should wait until that point to read it  none of the books story really affect the broader universe until the very last chapter where it has a major effect on the events in the next few books while at the same time reading it ahead of other books might spoil them.Edit Just to clarify I would recommend reading them in the order on that page first the FASA books though if its the clan era youre interested in you might skip straight to Lethal Heritage then the ROC books excluding the reprints and Far Country DO NOT READ FAR COUNTRY.

6765853,0,t3_48duw7,They are set during canon events but they arent canon themselves. Although Mechwarrior  had a novel adaption so its kinda canonized.Theres usually stuff in games that contradict the setting for example MW Theres stuff like a shield generator doesnt exist in the setting. Also neither Clan Wolf nor Jade Falcon went to Terra in the Invasion Era. MW Mercs A Mauler shows up among the Comstar forces a mech they wouldnt have or need to have. MW Theres way too many new IS designs among the Smoke Jaguars. They should actually have been fielding old SL designs. MW Mercs The Davion ending pretty much contradicts the canon ending of the war it was Peter who killed Nondi Steiner though Spectre did point out that he didnt take credit because he didnt care. The Steiner ending is pretty close since Katherine SteinerDavion was handed over to Clan Wolf. MWO Set during the Clan Invasion though the conflict is vastly different from what is depicted in MWO. Comstar was the only IS faction on Tukayyid for instance and they waged a horrible war.

8637514,0,t3_4xs5yh,Been a long time since I read the fluff but I thought most of the original IS omnis were meant to be test beds proof of concept designs rather than finished products. So much more time was spent figuring out how to make a mech modular than was spent figuring out how to optimize performance.Also that was still the real life era of intentionally unoptimized designs. A lot of FASA mechs were designed to be mediocre. I think around that time there was a theory floating around in the game development community that you should provide objectively bad options to the players. Those reward better or at least better educated players over those who didnt spend the effort to learn the system and it also created some potential handicaps that good players could use to balance things out against weaker players. It also created the illusion of more options.,battletech,d6lapr2,2,t5_2qnwk

9948326,0,t3_5hwn4o,I had fun with this one. Out of curiosity fired up Megamek and played it. This unit was a ton of fun. The CSKM Cossack is an experimental unit built by the Capellan staterun Solaris program beginning in  intended as a propaganda machine to boost the moral among the troops and public as well as pump much needed funding and support into the Solaris games recovering from the Jihad.Equipped with cutting edge stealth armor and jump jets the Cossack uses their main disadvantage the excessive heat build up to its advantage fitting a Triple Strength Myomer system in conjunction with a massive  XXL fusion engine with supercharger normally reserved for powering small dropships. Its only armament is a massive vibroblade capable of carving chunks out of enemy mechs. To handle the immense strength of the engine and brutal nature of melee combat the Cossack is built around a reinforced heavy duty internal structure. The end result is an  ton assault mech that can sprint at over kph is resistant to nearly all commonplace sensors and despite its total lack of offensive armament is capable of closing with and pummeling nearly any foe into twisted scrap metal. The Cossack became an instant favorite in the Solaris arenas due to the graphic nature and insane brutality of its kills. For many seasons the replay reels were filled with holovids of a Cossack slicing a medium mech neatly in half with a single blow or using its bare hands to rip limbs from assault mechs. The most famous Cossack kill was in  when a statestabled Cossack caused a FNRX Fafnirs reactor to go critical and detonate in the middle of a crowded brawl taking down four other mechs with it by picking up a PNTK Panther and hurling the entire mech at the Fafnir smashing it straight through the already weakened center torso armor and triggering the explosion. The Capellan pilot and stable were sued and lost over  million CBills after the incident caused the death of  involved pilots and fourteen spectators. After the incident firmly nailed the Cossack into the public consciousness across the entire Inner Sphere as a vicious and insanely lethal mech the Capellan Confederation began to silently build more and more Cossacks and assigning them to specialized urban defense units often wearing lurid paintjobs identical to the famous Cossacks running around the Solaris arenas. The psychological effect the units have on the battlefield is strong as even the most hardened of mechwarriors atop the biggest assault mechs will still break into a sweat at the thought of entering the narrow confines of a city guarded by Cossacks.

10201160,0,t1_dc0cdly,Go ahead and call them.  I placed an order on Dec th and then emailed them to remove  items from it.  On Dec th they said if it hadnt left the warehouse yet theyd be removed from the order.  On Dec nd judging by the packing slip and postmark it finally left the warehouse with the items I had requested be cancelled.  It showed up on the th and they havent responded to any of my emails.The only luck I expect you to have is with your credit card company.  Be aware I think you only have  days to file a dispute.  After that your consumer rights are forfeit.As far as Im concerned now CGL is a scam company.  Ill never order from them again.  Ill order their stuff from Amazon or from my FLGS.  Maybe even if I see a booth at a convention.  But Ill never again order anything from them online.,battletech,dc0cwy1,3,t5_2qnwk

10376865,0,t1_dccclm5,In a modificationheavy environment one of the first things you want to do is introduce a houserule nerfing doublesinks we simply treat the first  as singles reducing the overall dissipation by .It does mean that many canon designs become quite bad when fielded unmodified thoughIt says something that even with such a significant nerf double heatsinks are still frequently the optimal choice when refitting a mech. Im not sure how the game designers ever thought they were balanced.,battletech,dcka4s4,1,t5_2qnwk

10493144,0,t1_dcxezit,Awesome welcome to the hobby. Congratulations on being the  of the battletech community and over  of the resouces CGL is currently spending.  The book will be useful but its still unnessacary.  Even if  new player jump online and say that this book is perfect for them it doesnt justify the expense in resources when so much stuff is going wrong. Also sense you are new Ill do you a solid.....never ever ever ever order anyrhing directly from CGL. Always always always go through a third party vendor. Unless you like throwing your money into the void and hoping something you want comes out in return. ,battletech,dcxiapj,1,t5_2qnwk

10891308,0,t1_de3c4dz,Mainly with Broadcast Week specific house rules that are frankly quite silly. Because were playing a Solaris campaign where each of us runs a stable the campaign is split up into several broadcast weeks  each with a roster of fights to select from.Each broadcast week has a special rule applied to it which is voted on at the start of the week. Some of them are quite tame but we have had some more bizarre rules imposed in some of those weeks such as You may voluntarily take a pilot hit to reroll or force another player to reroll. When a criticals roll is made against you you may accept one additional crit to be able to roll a criticals roll against them on the same location. Im glad that ones over it was a very messed up weekThe results are hilarious but would definitely make a more serious BattleTech player cringe.Weve house ruled a few other things though those are more sensible tweaks to aspects where we thought the rules were weaker things like nerfing Double Heat Sinks and Jumping both of which become quite OP in an environment where you can design your own mechs.,battletech,de3d0fl,1,t5_2qnwk
11202213,0,t1_df1pngk,Yeah probably the only way I can think of for those sort of shenanigans to be legit would be something like a Hunchback or a Victor beating up on a lance of armed Industrialmechs.,battletech,df1r8so,1,t5_2qnwk
11455841,0,t1_dfrv3pe,I normally use MML I play a fair bit of MekHQ against the bot but I only have my phone on me. If Megamek got ported over to work on Android Id never stop stomping mechs around. ,battletech,dfuif6j,1,t5_2qnwk

11740984,0,t1_dgqlaty,I just dont understand how they could go to all the work to create an entire new store only for it to be the exact same as the old store but with prettier graphics.  I know the old stores primitive construction was blamed for a lot of the screwups but it seems to be getting clear that its something more than that.I gather buying new PDFs is the only thing that works properly.,battletech,dgqvcfr,2,t5_2qnwk
