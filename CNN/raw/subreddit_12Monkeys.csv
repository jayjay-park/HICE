3187707,0,t1_cos9fbk,gt Still Id much rather they go and meet the people who made the time machine and get them onboard with the whole mission. The right time for that to happen might be after the virus is released but before the whole world has collapsed as it becomes clear they cannot solve the problem in There is probably a decent reason why the scientists who created the time machine did not use it to rectify events. I am guessing that they got wiped out quickly.... OR they could be part of another time travel group who set it up specifically for that group to use in the future.,12Monkeys,cosemhm,2,t5_31827

3322488,0,t1_cp6y1fc,I think it only makes sense if Cole was pulled forward during their first attempt before he woke up in the rubble. When Jones amp co were trying to pull him back the second time it was unclear whether he was feeling the usual time pull pains or he was just groaning while trying to move the beam and the scene was intentionally edited to make it seem like Cole was affected by the time machine.Aza and her father couldnt have time traveled with Cole or she wouldnt have known the history of the plague when he asked. Aza also commented on his cough earlier when they were communicating so it seemed like she already knew of the disease and its symptoms.Note that the scenes with Cole didnt have the Year screens preceding them. Only the scenes with Cassie had the Chechnya  titles.,12Monkeys,cp6zpxs,18,t5_31827
3327568,0,t1_cp7fuhk,Its probably because she assumed and Cole did imply this Operation Troy was the reason the plague spread plague was a government engineered virus. She assumed the sample destroyed was the only sample in existence and the military would not be making more. She also assumed that they didnt take him to the future by the time the missle hit and that they cant take back a dead body body there meant mission failed and body not there meant that the virus disappeared subsequently he disappears. ,12Monkeys,cp7kjcl,2,t5_31827

3396243,0,t3_2yymu1,Preface I wrote this wall of text below thinking about what I would do if I had the means to stop a virus in any way possible. Im disecting the series and characters as if it were real life. I know my views on all this would not progress the plot at all. That being said read on!At first I was a strong advocate of Jones. Time travel seems like the best option to solve the problem of the plague. Jones is a very convincing lady after all and her logic seems promising. Why try and find a cure for a virus when you can just erase it from ever existing in the first place? With something as grand as time travel who could argue her? With every episode I watch I see time as if it were conscious testing anyone who tries to manipulate it. We see it with Jones and now with Cole. These two good people see no hope for the future of their timeline are wrapped up in their selfish motives Cassie and Hannah are compromising everything in  and care little to nothing for anyone or anything in their present all because of the mission. Yes theres a chance they can change everything and reset the world but that doesnt mean they have to disregard anything that doesnt involve going back in time. This idea of saving humanity through time travel has warped their perception of reality causing them to execute any other solution there may be for the virus.Jones going as far as to lie about Foster finding a cure to one of the mutations and murdering half of Spearhead. We even see in the flashback of when Cole and Ramse first arrive at Jones facility that its Ramse the moral compass in my eyes who convinces Cole to stay and do the whole time travel gig. Now after seeing the effects the mission has had on both the present and future Ramse says Its not working. He even says This has got to stop. Were done. After all is said and done Cole can focus on one thing...saving Cassie. He cares so little for anything else that he even takes a few verbal hits at his once best friend saying What about you Ramse? and Your son is already dead. Really Cole? I mean youre hot but youre loosing your charm.Time travel SEEMED to be the best option at first. Yet something inside me and Ramse is saying time can not be changed. The more you fight it the more it fights back. Trying to change the past seems to only be changing the people in the present. Like Ramse says at the end of this episode Its meant to happen brother... No matter what Cole does Cassie always dies. The virus is never eliminated. Humanity is not saved. Time travel appears niceeasy in theory but all this dwelling in the past and trying to rewrite history is making a mess of  as if it werent bad enough. Causing relationships to be compromised moral compasses to be lost and innocent blood to be shed. Im starting to think moving forward with the postapocalyptic world and finding a cure to every mutation would have been the better option for everyone. But who knows Ill probably change my mind next episode haha.So heres a question for you guys using the same thought process I explained in the preface What do YOU think is the best solution for the virus? Using time travel to manipulate the past or seeking hope in the future and finding a cure?,12Monkeys,cpfechh,2,t5_31827

8072749,0,t3_4pqfdt,Youre probably not going to change your view so maybe I can nuance some things for you.Initially I also thought the choice of Ramse made little sense to let billions of people die just to have his son. But rewatching season  made me realize he just was in camp Foster who had a cure. They just dont want to mess with time and try to deal with the present. Having his son is just the conformation of that view.I do agree that alliances shift constantly but Im mostly ok with it. Cassie from  is a different person from the one who spent  months in the future before picking Cole up. She totally got mindfucked by The Witness and shares a great burden. Both Ramse and Cassie lost so much which explains their impulsive behaviour. So I can see them set aside their mutual hatejealousy and go all in to kill The Witness. And remember that although Cole and Ramse were friends before arriving at the facility Cole wanted to go leaving Ramse behind. Ramse then fired a gun so Cole got caught again. So their friendship was also one of necessity despite begin together for all those years.Sure Ramse overreacts really fast and Cassie has locked away her softer side but I think almost all those things can be traced back to influential events that caused them to behave like this.My focus would be to find things to change the map of the witness. Cole caused history to change by saving Ramse so why not try to make some other history changing decisions. Or get some more advice from old Jennifer. Or go back to the baby messengers and give them a less destructive future. Time would certainly like that But I try not to poke too many holes in the narrative since you might end up poking yourself into a chickenegg problem. As long as I keep getting fed answers Im satisfied ,12Monkeys,d4ngbmr,8,t5_31827

That Jennifer was shown before Cole changed the future in  by destroying the virus. If all what we have seen is the result of main protagonists future actions then that was all preordained.

8278912,0,t1_d5ceu9o,You make good points about the dont kill James Cole thing but him being the Witness is just lazy to me. If that happens I will be very disappointed because then what is the point of anything in the show? I would much rather the Witness be some ancillary character thats there but not really seen i.e. Dr. Adler or maybe Sam. Id actually be cool with the Witness being someone completely new to the cast. In a way I think that would be my preference. Id like the Witness to be someone we know nothing about.....EDIT Also I dont think Cole would have purchased the house before the paradox because time is supposed to unravel if it happens from his perspective. But then again maybe that is an argument for it in that he had some savings and was like Fuck it I cant take it with me.
