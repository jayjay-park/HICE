Try for several postsweek.Use resources like Google News. Look for some good websites on Chicano culture and post their articles. Find places like MOLAA in Long Beach and SelfHelp Graphics in ELA that are doing events on Chicano culture and post those. Post articles on Chicano history like the Zoot Suit Riots and Cesar ChavezUFW. The OC Weekly regularly posts articles on Orange County Chicano history.
