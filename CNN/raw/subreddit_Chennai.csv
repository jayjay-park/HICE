1610653,0,t3_2cpjhm, You should definitely check out the Chennai Trekking Club and if youre a motorcycle aficionado the Madras Bulls Motorcycle Club. As far a football goes dont know too much about whats available for badmintonsquash these days you might try out the corporation grounds behind the BHEL facilities or even the Easwari Engg CollegeSRM Dental grounds in Ramapuram. Off MIOT hospitals For stage theatre easiest route is to either call or visit sabhasacademies directly and ask them for a brochureevents catalogue for the upcoming months. Usually this will cover most bases. Also ask around in your office someone will probably advertise. For movies obviously any of the malls PVR EA Citi Centre will serve Not to mention the other regular hauntsSatyam Udhayam Ega etc.I dont really know too much about the pubsbars scene now I come home once a year for about a month but theres usually a lot of churn in terms of what places are open and what policies they enforce so I dont really know what the current status of places are.Hope this helps for what its worth. ,Chennai,cji6utu,2,t5_2qj2l

3925649,1,t3_35eger,Yes Chennai is pretty dirty and lacks proper sanitation. In some neighborhoods its more pronounced than in others. I dont think its bad enough to warrant vaccinations or medication. Stick to bottled water  that goes for anywhere in India. Thats probably the only precaution youll need to take. Indian food might be too strong for your stomach though thats not a cleanliness or germ issue. But having said that street food is not very hygienic stick to the better restaurants unless you particularly want to sample street foodEdit  Getting down voted for calling Chennai dirty but fuck it. It is dirty. Doesnt help to be in denial about it. Just because Europe has some bad neighborhoods as well doesnt change anything. At least dont be a pussy about it justify why its not a dirty city if youre going to downvote.,Chennai,cr3rd7f,1,t5_2qj2l
