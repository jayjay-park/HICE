His heart was pounding in his ears the rhythm of war drums spurring him onto glory. He rose from his aerial chariot like the dawn arms reaching for the stars.The octopus beast pitched the fridge short of the target. It was possibly better than sending him into the blades. It still fell short of ideal literally in this case. As it reached the apex of its arc Accuser pounced. Powerful legs sent him sailing the last few feet to clasp ahold of the helicopters right skid.Hauling himself up he quickly exploded the heads of the two armed officers in the back half of the cabin with short range pistol fire. He moved into the front and similarly dispatched the pilot. The helicopter immediately banked hard to the right as the fresh corpse slumped over all the instruments. Accuser unbuckled him opened the door and sent him back to the Earths warm embrace.Taking the pilots chair but remaining unbelted and leaving the door open Accuser quickly realised he had very little understanding of how to fly a helicopter. He toyed with the basic controls in an attempt to level off his spiralling descent to mild success. At the last moment before it collided with the remaining police vehicles Accuser leapt from the open door and grasped at the gutter of the warehouse. He hit the wall hard having the wind knocked out of him and suffering bruising.The helicopter did not explode on contact with the ground but the damage was still severe. By the time Accuser descended the building handoverhand by the gutters piping there was noone left to shoot at him. The police were either dead dying scattered or catatonic. Accusers powerful legs carried him down the street after the aquatic horror towards the sea.,wormrp,cylanh4,1,t5_37kqs

He can attack from a further range by strethching shadows but the tendrils must originate from the twenty meter radius of shadows. No he cannot use projectiles as once the shadow is detattched from him or the shadows hes using it essencially ceases to be. As a structure they are solid but malleable so like soft metaleasily shapable by his will but strong enough to take a hit if he isnt overdoing the stretching. At its densest it can be comparable to High carbon steel but that reduces fairly quickly as the shadow is stretched. The increased speed is from the fact that covered with it he can will it to move for him carrying him with the shadow essencially working as an external shadowbased muscle system that allows him to move faster since thought is slightly faster than reaction since there is the travel time through nerves this means he can move at a slightly faster speed due to no time lag between thought and action. As well as that he cannot feel shadows hes solidified only shadows he can solidify so if someone cut his wall he wouldnt know unless he could see it.

But considering most of what he does depends on frequency including this I dont think hed hold onto one for too long. Also hes a hero so hes unlikely to just go around killing willy nilly.Inanimate objects would depend. Windows on a car or apartment would have their own frequency as would bricks etc... Hed have to shake them individually with sound. Hed be more likely to just send blasts of loud noise at them and not attune to their frequency. This was meant as more of a high end I can do this thing sort of a last resort moveI imagined he could selectively absorb but anything being absorbed is stored away.

Makes clones with them probably saw us leave.  Distributor was the partner and he fiddles with powers. Sometimes in good ways sometimes not. Hes a striker dont let him touch you.As for the duplicating man that was Schrodinger. I dont know much but he makes clones and teleports short distances. They also argue with each other so they might be independent minds. Last time I met him they all started to fight each other before I said anything. You saw how theyll squabble over a lead pipe.Local PRT leader is called Freefall previously inertia. Gravity manipulation. Scary stuff.PHO is going to be handy here all wards and heroes have entries there that describe what they do. Villains are the trickier ones nobody willingly outputs information.Theres at least one biotinker messing with bodies. Youve probably heard about the kidnappings. Mutated dogs and humans birds that repeat whatever they hear.Plague doctor makes plagues. Spreads them via bottles. Wears a plague doctor mask surprise surprise. Engage at range.Ive seen at least one cyborg probably some tinker who messes with his own body. I watched a projectile smash his face off and he kept going. Insanely durable.Then theres the gang activity nobody knows about that stuff...But I have a theory.He glares at the security camera.There is someone backstage. Someone who can look through cameras internet listen through phone speakers steals data and uses it to ruin lives. Whoever the hell this is also builds robots. Drones and androids both.

Whatever was happening was interrupted by the vehicle suddenly rocking. Not much as it was meant to deal with some horrendous brutes but enough to be felt.Then there was the sound. A terrible sound. It was as if a sandstorm was raised to three times the standard speed before it smashed against the van. The whole right side of the vehicle was instantly covered in darkness as individual particles grinded against metal and glass. Something somehow worse than nails against a chalk board. Based upon the various highly hardened men and two women holding their helmets it was terrible.Sergeant! The young officer yelled.Suddenly on the intercoms and within side the vehicle music blared part way through a song to make the sound more bearable.The vibrations however seemed to lead to a new problem. The weakness of the vehicle seemed to be almost felt by the monsterous sand. The two highly armored back doors were air tight...but not air tight enough against the forces of nature weathering their very seals...Sand began to force its way in.Specialist Brooke! The officer yelled out. A moment later a set of containment foam was sprayed over it. Within seconds it hardened and slowed the assault. But it wouldnt last. The men looked around before undoing their armor and piling it up at the parts which grew in translucence. They were then promptly sprayed over.Sergeant fuck the reinforcements. Hit it! And like that another sound amidst the chaos grew. PRT vans were state of the art the same level as some military vehicles. Only thing better was a full APC. But these beasts were capable of all sorts of tricks. One of them was driving without actual tires. Itd destroy most of the vehicle be costly to the road and give everyone inside a headache but for the sake of survival.Itd have to do.With a lurch they were off and for a moment there were sighs of relief...At least before the dust storm followed them.,wormrp,d43gfd2,1,t5_37kqs

She would cringe when she heard that the sand was attempting to cut through the metal to get through to them...she had no idea how successful it was in the endeavor but she really hoped that the PRT vans were as good as they say.Unlike the other officers Tess would groan and facepalmwhile the girl wasnt always a fan of humor she understood when it was necessary to diffuse a situation.

9256490,0,t1_d8p8csg,I never did say I do vigilante acts did I? Now youre putting words into my mouth congratulations. Well done you obviously can think.Want me to be truthful to you? Okay I will were not guinea pigs to fit your little box Darryl I dont know why you were transferred here but youre not the authority figure we need to tell us we are wrong about what we do. What was it your point was? Mad at the protectorate mad at us because we didnt bother mentoring the Wards. Yeah they make mistakes. Yes Protectorate makes mistakes. Were a fucked up situation and we dont bother paying respect to the rules and thats been the situation for a long while. The point is that we are at least trying to help this city even if we arent going by the rules. Were trying to mitigate damage done by villians even if its done in a way that isnt right by your book.And you made my point. Im a civil servant paid to help protect Ashton thats all Im meant to do and no further. Do I need to mentor Wards when I spend time patrolling and doing my job? Learn lifes not fair? Newsflash it isnt fair. Everyone dies everyone has a shit time thats life. Thats how I was taught as a ward and most Ashton Protectorate before they all transferred or left.But wait a minute! Lets have our first action when moving here to say fuck you to all the Protectorate for not bothering trying to help the Wards because we didnt think we need to! Lets just say goodbye to all that and try to follow the rules from now on! And after that lets hope that every teammate Im meeting likes me afterwards! Great job.At this point Mistblade seems to be looking at Darryl with a fixed eye. Your only acknowledged flaw is that youre a loudmouth? That isnt true but whatever. Let me say this to you youre trying to appease to an unpopular opinion forcing everyone to take action in something they dont want to because you want to sleep better at night knowing Wards are being mentored. I try to follow the rules I dont act like a mad vigilante not calling in everything I see. But see heres the thing I dont force my will onto others as a condescending asshole who thinks hes high and mighty in terms of how he thinks God forbid.And I can tell you whats not needed here the mentorship. The Wards are frighteningly skilled with their powere and show a maturity level at the ranks of other Protectorate members. They make mistakes but they learn from them becoming more experienced and learning to adapt to them. They arent arrogant pieces of shits like you they know how to act because theyre set into situations that wouldnt force them to take dangerous and needless risks like we do everyday.And Ive merely been truthful about my thoughts been saying what I believe is true. But you apparently dont believe me and hardly I think your feathers are ruffled by the way your shaking in rage. Im not mad at all I wouldve left already if I was.And the serial killer case? Isnt going fast at all and you are right my powers useless to trying to investigate. So what? My colleagues have busy timetables on their hands so busy that they dont have even any time to try to socialize at all. I dont ask them because Imy arrogant enough to believe I cant do it I dont ask because they have too much workload on their hands that Id rather not burden them. Ive been asking PRT intelligence services for notes on the killers as well as contacting other branches to figure out any connections.
