4392066,0,t1_cskp6wc,Youre again inserting ideological motives into the common soldier which isnt the case. The facts dont have your back here the soldiers did write letters just like generals Lee and Grant. They dont need you to nor would they want you to speak on their behalf.We need another war to help put things in perspective for you.If you were to be drafted into another Vietnam would you burn your card and move to Canada? Some would harshly judge you for that some wouldnt. Those that wouldnt do that and decided to serve some would be judging them harshly some would be honoring them.Me I would respect the decisions of both. The draft dodger has his conviction but many would still call him a traitor or coward. The recruits would be serving their country.At the end of the day I think it says more about the individual doing the judging than it says about what is being judged.,USCivilWar,cskpziv,3,t5_2s3mx
4392802,0,t3_3bbaqd,Ok I am all for removing it from goverment buildings and such but its just starting to get ridiculous. Its a fact of history. No one is trying to whitewash the swastika from history which I would argue is a much worse symbol of hatred and bigotry,USCivilWar,csksyr5,18,t5_2s3mx
