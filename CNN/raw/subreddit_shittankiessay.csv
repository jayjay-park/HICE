6993393,0,t1_d18vyc7,I think thats incredibly determinist though and its a line I never followed entirely. If simply living and experiencing Capitalism was enough to drive people towards Socialism we would have had it several times over especially in the early stages of Capitalisms development when it was superexploitative. As opposed to leading immediately towards a Socialist consciousness what people experience is deepening levels of alienation. Some of this channels into political engagement  involvement in movements activism etc.  but mostly it becomes apathy. Without an organisation of the working class pushing forward a concrete alternative the working class as a whole simply wont develop a coherent socialist consciousness. The ideas of the ruling class are the ruling ideas and for us to build a revolutionary movement those ideas must be constantly challenged or else you leave the door open to all sorts of nonalternatives  nationalism fascism progressive liberalism general apathy.You essentially said it yourself if the party organisation was unimportant then Stalinists wouldnt be able to hijack movements to begin with. Obviously the revolutionary movement at its core is based in the experiences of the working class but there also needs to be a coherent ideological expression as well which comes from party organisation or it loses potency and can be subverted.,shittankiessay,d191l0k,3,t5_31s6m

A large share of the output devoted to luxury consumption is transferred from capitalist consumption to workers consumption but not consumer goods. increased employment labor rights since labor is now at a premium and people simply not having much to spend their money on are also factors.

The Palestinians have tried unwillingly to live in other Arab countries. They were rejected sometimes even humiliated and persecuted by the socalled Arab family. They were made aware in the most painful way of their Palestinianness they were not wanted by Lebanese or Syrians by Egyptians or Iraqis. They had to learn the hard way that they are Palestinians and thats the only country that they can hold on to.

9840857,0,t3_5g73yd,gtThe first full length movie ever produced was D.W. Griffiths The Birth of a Nation released in .That really depends on your definition of full length movie. If you say that a feature film has to be at least  minutes long then yeah sure The Birth of a Nation was the first fulllength movie at least the first that was produced in the USA.I dont think that definition really works for early cinema though because there were early films that would roughly fit the role of a feature film namely being the thing the audience is paying to see rather than just being a part of a larger show or something but were usually about an hour in length. So often you see historians name earlier films as the first featurelength movie.And if you take that more liberal definition of fulllength then The Birth of a Nation wasnt even DW Griffiths first feature film let alone Hollywoods or the worlds.But Maupin would probably say that definition is revisionist so whatever.gtWoodrow Wilson the American President who worked with D.W. Griffith to create the racist propaganda film The Birth of a Nation in ...Dude what? Wilson didnt work with Griffith. The film has some title cards that quote from Wilsons History of the American People and the guy who wrote the book The Clansman on which the film was based was a friend and classmate of Wilson when the latter was doing the work for his PhD. And then decades later Wilson saw the film in a special screening at the White House.

10262198,0,t1_dc71dr9,Id just like to point out I added references to some of my points in my previous post. I saw you posted your response before I finished that so maybe you didnt see that.gt I would argue the situation is similar to ethnic Russians in the Baltic states on a massive scale not an interethnic problem like in BelarusAs far as I can tell its somewhere in between Latvia and Belarus. That is to say a bit less than half of the population is made up of Ukrainianspeaking ethnic Ukrainians some of which speak pure Ukrainian and some of which speak something closer to Surzhyk about a quarter of the population are Russianspeaking ethnic Ukrainians who are the main population of cities like Kharkiv Kiyv and Odessa and about a fifth of the population is made up of ethnic Russians. Its true that the vast majority of ethnic Ukrainians can speak Ukrainian but that doesnt mean much when it comes to language use in practice  the fact that you know a language doesnt mean you use it that often.gt The shift already has occurred beginning in the late s early sI dont think the main turning point in the shift towards Russian was in the s or s. At that time there was no compulsory schooling or mess media so it was much more difficult to impose a language from above without demographic shifts than it is now. As far as I know most Ukrainian families that switched over to Russian did so under the Soviet Union.gt now it is being reversed. Im not sure to what extent its been reversed. The fact that a language is used in public institutions doesnt necessarily have to have much repercussion on the way people speak in their private lives and what language they pass onto their children which is the real issue when it comes to language revitalisation. In fact when it comes to minority languages people tend to put too much faith in public institutions especially symbolic official status and presence of the language in schools and fail to realise that its key for the community to use the language in social contexts. Its possible though that the current conflict with Russian may have an impact on language use among Russianspeaking ethnic Ukrainians.In any case my point is not that Ukrainian is on the brink of extinction or anything that catastrophic. The only problem is that internationally all the successes weve seen in language revitalisation have been extremely limited and none of them have fully succeeded in fully normalising the use of any of these languages. For that reason I tend to err on the side of caution. We need a radical change in paradigm if we dont want the vast majority of the worlds languages to go extinct.,shittankiessay,dc79y3v,3,t5_31s6m
