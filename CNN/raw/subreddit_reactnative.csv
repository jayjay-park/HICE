3524491,0,t3_30jf5a,Hey there I work at Facebook on React Native. Its great to hear about your enthusiasm for RN Android. It isnt quite as mature as it is on iOS and it is still quite tightly integrated with Fb infrastructure. We wanted to opensource as early as possible because there are a lot of shared concerns between the platforms that we need early feedback and support on.When it comes to writing web React code that will almost work on native Use ES JSX and CommonJS. Best accomplished with babel and webpack or browserify Stick to ltdivgt ltspangt ltinputgt ltimggt etc. Dont use any fancy tags Use reactstyle and flexbox Check out the react native docs and example apps for other APIs you might want to prepare for because the Android API will be very similar There is currently no great solution for crossplatform navigation but it is something were working towards. If youre curious how the navigation works right now see the use of ltNavigatorgt in this example code,reactnative,cpu0mqe,6,t5_37k5y

4998227,0,t1_cuobgsz,Honestly im not sure. The navigator component isnt something that is rendered but contains your entire app or a section of the app. I use the navigator component and my touchableopacityhighlights work fine. ,reactnative,cuoh1ob,1,t5_37k5y
5843074,0,t1_cxlj9kc,Actually youll always have a different UI file for Android and iOS. You have a different index.js but its very small and only includes interface elements. The meat of your application will be in files shared for both platforms.See for example,reactnative,cxljxm5,1,t5_37k5y

7464120,0,t1_d2qkrsj,No but I have friends that have recently used reacttypescript on windows with VS. Painful. Im quite happy in linux land with an old issd with gb of ram. My IDE is WebStorm atm but atom could be fine as well. I drive most of the build commands etc from the command line.  I run Google Android Emulator as well to test locally and dont run out of ram. Other folks use Genymotion as their Android test bed of choice. If you run the Google emulation you can run the Intel x images with kvm for fast virtualisation. Just install kvm and make sure your bios has the virtualisation instruction set switched on. Note that Google emulator needs an environment variable set ie EXPORT ANDROIDHOMEAppandroidsdklinux in the .bashrc file  create it if its not there sudo aptget install kvm libvirtbin ubuntuvmbuilder bridgeutils and then log back in As for where to start  umm... just read and watch    Introduction to React   complete video tuts    React and therefore reactnative is a pleasure to develop in. I touched on Angular a long while back and disliked the complexity that came with doing directives I believe I encountered scope hell before there was a name for it. Your brain may rebel a little against the reactredux way of thinking but in a very short space of time you should suddenly get a light bulb go off. Then unfortunately it becomes hard to go back to older technologies ,reactnative,d2qmhgz,1,t5_37k5y
7633595,0,t1_d39vkjm,Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I totally agree with what you are saying about new techs  Im just doing this for fun and to learn so taking it one step at a time is great for me. Ive used Flux with React.js just never with Native  so as this is my first real native app I will probably hold off on Flux. That being said could you elaborate on the first paragraph? What do you mean write them as if there is no stored data? I guess Im unfamiliar with the concept of priming in my experience with flux I was hitting the API when the component was mounted and then it was rerendering whenever the statestore changed and saving if need be. ,reactnative,d39wc9g,1,t5_37k5y

9477322,0,t1_d9gxzzm,Unit testing their components was not easy  Their components didnt play nice with jest or ava.The components were not that extensible. I found myself moving lots of components into my own project then modifying them to suit my needs and then wishing that I had just built them out myself.It was a great help to learn react native and it was nice to have something so tangible so fast but ultimately I wasted time using it. I would recommend going slower in the beginning and learning some react best practices instead of trying to get a head start with native base and then having to refractor things later on,reactnative,d9ha8s4,2,t5_37k5y
