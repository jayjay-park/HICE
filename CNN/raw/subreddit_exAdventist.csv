1212262,0,t1_ci5zvdc,She is being openly persecuted and harassed by the church at wide scale and locally. It might be over her trying to take somebody with her but that I doubt. Just fanatics in a small town then?,exAdventist,ci5zxiq,3,t5_2srn6
1700216,0,t1_cjrt62w,On a positive note this guy is great for testing logical fallacies and general rhetorical bullshit. When I was going through my deconversion some years ago I spent a lot of time watching and reading a bunch of SDA material to make sure I wasnt making a mistake and Professor Veith was at the top of my list.Thanks Veith!,exAdventist,cjth3si,1,t5_2srn6
2356594,0,t1_cm2xutu,My father is an Adventist pastor. Generally he meets with the people interested in baptism and goes through a structured bible study course with them. It only takes a couple weeks if I recall. You dont have to be baptized to attend Adventist church though. Its very much a personal decision. You could attend for a while and approach the pastor when you are ready.,exAdventist,cm2zi42,3,t5_2srn6
4139740,0,t1_crs4mf0,Which is why when you consider all the things we should be concerning ourselves with Moaning about not being able to watch my little Pony or eat not having bacon or not being able to watch the Saturday Morning Cartoons or see Lion King in theaters seems a bit .....PretentiousFolk sounding like the second coming of Michael Jackson mewling about lost childhood. Childhood Ends. Live. Serve. Love. Help. Save Humanity.Once you come to the conclusion that there is no Savior what do you do? Whine about how you didnt get to play DampD? Lament the Hours spent listening to Astounding Facts and learning about multiple alloyed statues with feet of iron and clay?If there is no Savior  be a Savior.,exAdventist,crs5cj6,1,t5_2srn6

4717386,0,t1_ctoq9zf,Yeah I feel like I treat the unclean meats like a vegetarian would treat meat in general. It seems less like a religion thing after a while and more like a lifestyle choice! By now a lot of my friends already know that I dont eat pork so its hardly ever a big deal.,exAdventist,ctp5y7h,1,t5_2srn6

6967876,0,t3_3zy6ra,I have a conspiracy theory about the SDA diet but I dont think the founders were that smart. Anyway here it is The ideal SDA vegetarian diet can be described as high in carbohydrates low in protein. Every would be cult leader knows that such a diet interferes with clear thought and makes people more malleable. Thats why the Hare Krishnas and Moonies did it to their recruits back in the s. I think people like the SDAs and similar groups throughout history intuitively grasped this or mistook the lightheaded foggy feeling that these diets cause for spirituality. Thoughts?I dont really understand the theory in the OP....,exAdventist,d165823,1,t5_2srn6
8914209,0,t3_4grzm4,A couple notes right off the bat. Obviously the military theme is cheesy but its also something that perhaps with the power of hindsight feels like an obvious recognition that youre pushing your agenda onto an unwilling audience. If you need tactical weapons to explode your targets brains into submission attacking when theyre at their most vulnerable... that should call into question whether youre doing anyone a favor or even treating them like people.. Im sure some people will watch this and think low production values. But this video was probably for multiple artists and at least one editor an alltoorare opportunity for church members to apply their talents in a sanctioned and probably gratis way  which is the only way that talents have value. The vector art is possibly the most obvious example of this.. Around  we get the typical bullshit about how were literally nothing without God. This wasnt so funny when I was in the church but from an atheist perspective its almost beautifully absurdist as the poor misguided colporteurs do literally all the work while internally reenacting this scene. And not long afterward the desperate delusion at play in the scene where the salesmen get rejected on camera and praise God for it dramatizing a moment where some poor schmuck is just trying to go about his day unaccosted. Theres no winner in this scene. Its just a tragedy of different degrees for everyone involved.. Oh god that was just the tip of the iceberg...Okay Im going to bed and I dont know whether I have the heart to pick up in the morning. Im not sure I can imagine a job better designed to demoralize and disillusion the youth of the church  even pastors get to huddle inside the echo chamber.,exAdventist,d7jcven,1,t5_2srn6
10345510,0,t1_dcgpdf7,So it is really the judgemental nature of the SDA culture that caused you to leave rather than the belief system....or did you also come to the conclusion that the specifics of how SDA interpret the Bible are wrong or simply irrelevant?,exAdventist,dcgq0uq,3,t5_2srn6
10828520,0,t3_5uktn0,I have done it. I think I still have the training manual for canvassing leaders but its  miles away at my parents house. Heres a series of blog posts I wrote about my experiences. Keep in mind I was still a Christian though not an Adventist at the time of this writing,exAdventist,ddwvvs9,1,t5_2srn6
11660316,0,t3_65x5c4,I just remembered that for years now Ive had my religion on Facebook as Agnostic but none of my SDA peeps has ever mentioned anything about that to me. I have had debates with some SDA friends on fb have been asked if Im atheist by my more liberal SDA friends. Which I denied basically Im deep undercover. At worst people think Im a back slider but they probably believe Im SDA still.,exAdventist,dghpmlc,1,t5_2srn6
