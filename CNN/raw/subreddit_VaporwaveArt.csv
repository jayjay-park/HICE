3992022,0,t3_36753d,im quite taken by s design and in particular advertising and commercial products from the mid to end of the decade. im in the process of compiling a body of work that samples s and possibly late s music and may possibly throw in some samples loosely based around themes of aspiration capitalism upwards mobility and just a few cultural or complimentary ones from archive stuff from that era. im still in the process of thinking up a name for the album and the actual name for the project. here are some of the tracks which are works in progress or near enough finishedim thinking of using some art deco fonts for the main text in the centre of the image as art deco was a revival in the s. what I would like to know is does the imagery fit the audio? does it deviate too far away from the standard ideas of vaporwave design? not saying that people shouldnt experiment but does this design compromise the artistic philosophy and approach to the medium by being too far detached from it?,VaporwaveArt,crbbomw,3,t5_348oo

11754263,0,t3_67guvi,I would make the colors lighter and stick to blues pinks and purples for just about everything. There is far too much color. Vaporwave at least as I view it isnt about being funny or getting a laugh from it. Its not that it cant happen in an edit but it shoudlnt be the primary focus.,VaporwaveArt,dgsdir7,1,t5_348oo
