3300197,0,t1_cp48uhe,gt Christ surely is preaching to them but I dont see any mention of a second chance.The second chance here is in the opportunity for this ggeneration  those in Noahs day  to fail to accept God during their lifetimes and be granted another opportunity after they died. Not just any other opportunity  but be the only lost people of any generation to have a still crucified savior visit them to preach and offer them only salvation in the afterlife.This website I found here has a pretty good interpretation of the passage in question.  See if we can find any agreement here. It would seem that a text with such varying interpretations and controversy must be ambiguous in nature or else the worlds churches would reach a consensus about its meaning. Yet when the context of the passage is considered it becomes unmistakably clear. When we read the verses both prior to and following the verse in question the passage statesFor Christ also suffered once for sins the just for the unjust that He might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison who formerly were disobedient when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared in which a few that is eight souls were saved through water  Peter .Truly the passage is referring to Jesus Christ and it does plainly say that he preached to spirits in prison. However it also removes the guessing that leads to the conflicting interpretations. It says that Christ died but was made alive again through the Spirit of God by whom He preached to spirits in prison. So we know that the one who did the preaching was actually the Holy Spirit not Christ directly. The Spirit speaks the words given to Him by Christ see John  and therefore is Christs representative but nonetheless a distinct entity of God. We therefore know that the passage cannot mean that Jesus descended into hell to preach because it was the Holy Spirit that did the preaching not Jesus.But when and where is this prison and who are the spirits to whom the Holy Spirit preached the words of Christ? Verse  provides the answer.The spirits were formally disobedient. Disobedience to God is sin. The Bible clearly states that sinners in open rebellion toward God are slaves to sin or prisoners of unrighteousness see Romans . For additional texts where prisoner imagery is used to describe the condition of sin see Psalm  Isaiah   and Luke . So the spirits in prison are those in rebellion against God or sinners.When did the Holy Spirit preach to sinners? Can we know whether these sinners were alive or dead when this occurred? The passage continues to talk explicitly about the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared. The passage in its proper context is describing Christs ministry through the person of the Holy Spirit to reach sinners in the time of Noah before the flood. Nowhere does the passage give us license to send Jesus to hell in between the cross and the resurrection nor does it allow us to make the prison a heavenly learning ground after death. The passage is clear the Holy Spirit preached to sinners in the days of Noah before the flo  See more at ,BeyondAdventists,cp4g63k,0,t5_379b7
3340898,0,t1_cp90y72,If Christ was preaching and not offering salvation that is not preaching.gtWho says?When we answer we must use reality.  There has never been a sermon without the intent to turn one around to Christ.  Otherwise it is called a lecture. The whole point of preaching is to bring about change or repentance or to offer salvation.Here is Christ on his purpose for preaching Luke   And he said unto them I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also for therefore am I sent. and here Matthew        Luke .terevos the intermediate state that you describe is an updated version of LimbopurgatoryIn theological usage the name is applied to a the temporary place or state of the souls of the just who although purified from sin were excluded from the beatific vision until Christs triumphant ascension into Heaven the limbus patrum or b to the permanent place or state of those unbaptized children and others who dying without grievous personal sin are excluded from the beatific vision on account of original sin alone the limbus infantium or puerorum. Purgatory according to Catholic Church doctrine is an intermediate state after physical death in which those destined for heaven undergo purification so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven. Only those who die in the state of grace but have not in life reached a sufficient level of holiness can be in Purgatory and therefore no one in Purgatory will remain forever in that state or go to hell. This theological notion has ancient roots and is wellattested in early Christian literature but the poetic conception of Purgatory as a geographically existing place is largely the creation of medieval Christian piety and imagination.Methodist Doctrine The Essentials by Ted A. Campbell says The Methodist Articles of Religion following the teachings of the Reformation rejected the medieval Catholic idea of purgatory as a place where the souls of those who have died in Christ could be aided or helped by the prayers of the living. John Wesley himself believed in an intermediate state between and the final judgment sic where those who rejected Christ would be aware of their coming doom not yet pronounced and believers would share in the bosom of Abraham or paradise even continuing to grow in holiness there. This belief however is not formally affirmed in Methodist doctrinal standards which reject the idea of purgatory but beyond that maintain silence on what lies between death and the last judgment.WHY IS BELIEF IN THE INTERMEDIATE STATE A PROBLEM?It is belief in the first lie ever told to man.Genesis  And the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surely die God told the truth when he said to ADAM and EVE But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.Gen Satan did not just insert the word NOT but he added...then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil.  GenEvery doctrine that teaches that we dont die when we die but we somehow go to another place is satanic.The dead are dead.  Death is the opposite of life.  The dead do not think.  They do not go anywhere.  Not even David went to heaven! or to the intermediate state.  The dead must wait WITHOUT consciousness and remain asleep until the resurrection. Look at Marthas expectation in John  Martha answered I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.Martha did not expect to see Lazarus in the intermediate state But not until the resurrection.,BeyondAdventists,cp934zm,1,t5_379b7
