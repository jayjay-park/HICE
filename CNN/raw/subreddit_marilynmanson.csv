But then again I may have a somewhat biased view of it. I first heard it when I was thirteen and the album was a constant companion for me through the next four or so years of my life which frankly sucked. And sucked bad. As in I think Im going to kill myself bad. There were several times when I thought about doing something but instead decided to turn on my stereo and blast the album on repeat full volume for The Nobodies until I stopped crying and didnt have the energy or motivation to hurt myself anymore for that day. But even outside of my personal debt to the album I still feel that of all his albums Holy Wood remains the most relevant especially in the last week. Its a brutal take at the mass media and the condition of a disheartened America thats constantly force fed the blood and brutality of the world and our own nation as entertainment. ,marilynmanson,d55fb8z,5,t5_2s3wg
