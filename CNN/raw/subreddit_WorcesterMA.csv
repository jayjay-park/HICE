1112638,0,t3_26s8dj,This got posted as a new thread by mistake... damn noobs I live on the north side at The Summit. Nice residential area easy to forget youre in a city. The Greendale area is denser but still nice. Great Brook Valley between Lincoln St and Mountain St is a city housing area and has a unsavory reputation that I have had no reason to validate.I can confirm the greatness of Lou Rocs and OConnors. Lous can get busy but during the week you can usually walk right in. We tend to only go to OConnors during the fall and winter the food is good but heavy. Get the butternut soup. So good. Ovens just over the bridge in Shrewsbury does good pizza and look like a decent beer selection. Theres also Olis just over the line in West Boylston for good pizza and Italian. Crown Bakery on Gold Star is a Swedish bakery with good sandwiches and they give you a little pastry or slice of cake when you get one.Lincoln Plaza is the main shopping area on the north side. Typical assortment of big box stores. Greendale Mall has nothing to offer aside from Best Buy.,WorcesterMA,churk55,2,t5_2sf2m

1817659,0,t1_ck85fiw,Worcester is extremely livable. It gets a bad rap because of some bad neighborhoods and a downtown that is barren after pm but the city is pretty good overall. Its not Boston but Boston is a pain in the ass to live in sometimes.,WorcesterMA,ck87mi1,8,t5_2sf2m
