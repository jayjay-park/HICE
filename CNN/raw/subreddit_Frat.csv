When one of our guys died of a disease we had brothers of our chapter from all across the globe show up to the funeral. Far more of us still hang out with one another and host gettogethers than any sorority or even groups of sorority girls out there,Frat,ceh2kp7,2,t5_2s0mx

Time to return varies by store as well around heres its  days before you get charged late fees.As far as prices go all I can tell you is a keg of Keystone Light runs about  in Manhattan KS so a total of about  for a keg including the deposit fee as thats the only place Ive actually purchased a keg.

Our pledge gear was pretty much about making us look like shit and because we had to wear an undershirt the sweat just got ridiculous. Both pairs of whitewashed wranglers I wore during pledgeship got absolutely ruined guess its to be expected though.

Its sad....I know Im trying to hold on to something Im no longer apart of I assume Ill one day move on from this and cling to some other less fun quasi fraternity and be one of those mouth breathers who wears a weird hat and drives those tiny cars in the fourth of July parade. That will hopefully hold me over until I retire and retreat into myself becoming a sketchy recluse trying to drink myself to death until one day I meet a young mischievous boy who though he drives me nuts and tends to be trouble than not teaches me to love again but soon Ill find out I have terminal cancer and wont be around to see my new friend grow into the man I know he can be not while a local gang of Hmong thugs seem dead set on derailing my young friends journey.  So in one last blaze of glory Ill frame the gang bangers but in the process die doing so and end my own pain. As a final goodbye my young friend will find out I have willed my tiny car to him which was something I always knew he admired.,Frat,ckg7ww0,36,t5_2s0mx

Thats why national needs to be involved as they can usually leverage some brand of deal as a bandaid while alternative solutions are sought out.  In the meantime the chapter needs to do the value added pitch when recruiting as they simply cant win on price.  Without keeping recruitment up Ill tell you right now they have almost no shot of moving.  I know that sounds nasty but basically national is going to come down agree with the chapter and make a pitch to the local alumni board or their national housing foundation to invest in a new house for these guys.  The first thing those organizations are going to ask is Hows recruitment?  because theyre going to be calculating risk and return on investment.  If they see a failing chapter that cant recruit theyre going to walk away let the chapter die and invest in rechartering  years later instead of spending the money now on a risky active body that makes excuses instead of getting shit done.  OP.  Please keep this in mind when presenting to anyone outside national field staff.

2540848,0,t1_cmpveul,You need to pick your battles. A woman died at a fraternity house this semester from drinking too much at my alma matter. OFSA cancelled all homecoming activities for Greek Letter orgs. As a public university they legally cannot do this unless activities for all of the clubs are stopped.You know what we did as the BOG? Nothing. It wasnt worth the fight and I recommended that the undergraduates comply and they did. Now if this had continued we would have had a polite conversation with the Dean of OFSA regarding the potential legal ramifications of her decree. If that then didnt work then a strongly worded letter from one of our attorneys. If that still didnt work then we get a coalition of high donating Greek alumni and hold a CometoJesus meeting with the Dean of OFSA and her boss. If that still didnt work then you might file a legal case.Jumping right into a legal case is about as politically destructive an action as one can take. Thats the nuclear option.

Do you want to give  of yourself to help others regardless of receiving anything?If you answered all three questions with yes stick it out. My house was on the brink of collapse when I joined as a pledge class of one. Financials were a wreck taxes not paid and membership was in the single digits. I knew things were fucked when I was in your shoes. Once I got the hang of things we cut the fat fixed internal problems and got the show back on the road. If I can do it you can too. ,Frat,cp1o3ax,2,t5_2s0mx
3277765,0,t3_2xngef,Well if it means anything I think this sort of thing happens to every chapter at some point in time. Usually its because the exec board is not really doing their jobs or are seniors or juniors who are getting lazy. Id agree with the above. You can be the change that the fraternity needs. I had an opportunity do this for my chapter. I became social chair and helped us get out of the rut of not having alot of parties and activities.  However at the end of the day you have to decide what you really want. I know seeing this sort of thing as a pledge can be discouraging but you and your pledge brothers are the ones who can change all of that.  Talk to your pledge brothers and see if they feel the same way you do.  Figure out what it is that you and they could do to be able to fix or change some of the problems and then take the opportunity to run for exec board positions once youre initiated. In my case while pledging we all held positions within the pledge class just like exec positions and from there alot of us who held those positions moved on to exec and were very successful.  Maybe do a little more asking around and talk to your big brother about your concerns before you make your decision. You can pm me if you have anymore questions.,Frat,cp1w3y6,3,t5_2s0mx

4539235,0,t3_3d860u,Ive been out of the game for a while but for our big build parties we did GDI and they typically would have to know someone have a purposeinvite list only or be with a large group of attractive females. If there was a guy that we knew was wanting to rush with prior contact theyd get in free but watch out for shitheads that lead you along oh yeah Im thinking about it only lasts so long. Otherwise why the fuck would you want this random guy coming out? Most chapters would pair up for a philanthropic party and actually sell tickets too. Those usually had  chapters with similar interests get together in order to afford bigger bands. We used offduty Sherriffs for security and wristbandsXXs for minors and never had a problem in fact this significantly takes the legal burden off your end read not entirely.Its also worth it for bigger builds to hire a bartendervendor from a local bar they should be used to doing it if youre at a decent university town you give them a budget of what you want to spend what liquorsdrinks you want available if you go over budget just write another check and they take care of the labor... or use pledges.For Open Parties.......... just have a bar night. There is too much coordination and legal grey area with having a planned event to let some random dude you dont know come try and drink your shit and fuck girls you could be fucking. If you coordinate with a local bar you will get a cut of the barcover charge for promoting event and you dont have to worry about the responsibility of taking legal ramifications of some asshole drinking too much.What youre inquiring about sounds like a house party again do you really want open just collect some money at chapter on Monday for  kegs and task a pledge with being able to recognize what time it is and how much beer is left. If youve got an hour til the liquor store closes and youre running on E then someone is going to make another beer run or party will be over.Source Social ChairVPSgt of Arms or we title was Man Chapter at Big  University .,Frat,ct2stgo,12,t5_2s0mx

5034837,0,t3_3jwhcm,gtthe guys I see now are definitely not as coolsocialoutgoing as the ones I met when I rushed. This change was gradual I didnt notice it year by year but now it is a rather apparent shift. gtthey stay in their rooms playing League of Legends or Destiny all dayThe fraternity model thrives with extroverted outgoing adventuring athletic good looking Type A alphas.   This is the small subset of college guys who can be burnished rather than broken by a crucible pledgeship.  This is the small subset of college guys who are maximally attractive to sorority women.  These are the same guys who other guys looked up to in high school  and middle school  and usually in elementary school.If you have gradually drifted to initiating goobers more content playing video games in their room rather than adventuring together or  partying with girls then that drift eventually becomes selfsustaining in way that the former model is not.  Repeatedly recruiting the best of the best requires constant hard work  a wide net and constantly showing that what your House has to offer is the best choice on campus  because the best of the best have many good choices.  Recruiting goobers requires very little energy because goobers have few good choices.If your alumni are willing to step up and support the chapter through a few years of rebuilding  helping with the unfunded House costs and investing to make the Brotherhood program more epic then you MIGHT be able to turn this ship around.  But youll need an EPIC program of adventuring and development to appeal to a group of rushees who currently consider your chapter a bottom tier house of gaming addicted goobers.  Plan two epic adventures for the house every semester  funded mostly by alumni  maybe a ski trip to Colorado  maybe a sailing course in the Caribbean  maybe GoRuck  maybe ToughMudder.  Invite some select alumni to come along as role models and tellers of good stories  to show what the chapter used to be like.  Cast a much wider net  send your best alphatype guys  maybe you  to feeder high schools in the summer to identify prime guys who are attending your campus in the fall  barbecues water ski and lake parties beach days paintball afternoons.  The earlier you get the attention of that small group of prime guys the better your chance of winning their choice.  But you still have to offer the best choice.Youll have to convince the better sororities to give your events another look.  Sorority girls show up for the quality of the guys you have far more than they show up for the quality of the event itself.  So initially youre going to have to be creative and invest some bucks into turning the sororitys head and getting their attention  maybe carriage rides to your events  maybe flowers and serenades daily for a week before an invitation to an event is extended.For your current guys you will need to convince them that in order to be social successes on campus and maybe even to be successes later on they are going to have to invest some time in selfbetterment.  Start daily runs. Put some BowFlexes in the House.  Even consider getting someone who knows what the hell they are doing rare to do guymakeovers   new haircut  new clothes new look.  Make the guys you have want to better themselves with the carrot of more girls and more friends.Lastly accept NO help from Nationals.  Nationals wants the gooberization of us all  because goobers represent less liability risk  and they sometimes have higher grades.Frankly. most of the time a chapter initiates a critical mass of goobers its a death spiral.  But if you care about your House and care about having something worthwhile for your own son in a few decades then you have a chance to build something amazing.,Frat,cusw0tc,18,t5_2s0mx

The paddles are made using engraving and pyrography techniques and this variety would also be painted.  The side shown is usually not finished but in some cases I have seen them deeply carved and inked.  As far as price and value.  I would pay between  for it.  So unless he or the other people listed were significant in their careers its not something I would personally case unless you felt the need to.  If the history of the people listed on it is better than average then I would value it higher.  As far as my collection... I own paddles for the son of President William H. Taft Charles P. Taft   he was Mayor of Cincinatti  as well as others who were congressmen senators judges major magazine publishers  US Ambassadors A rocket scientist an Olympic gold medalist Opera Singers Sports figures Archivists Missionaries to China Pulitzer Prize Winning Authors and of course a multitude of Doctors and Lawyers theyre a dime a dozen as well as prominent family members of Corning Griswold Pillsbury Lord and Taylor Proctor Gamble Rockefeller Bush etc. etc.  My paddles range in age from about    currently.  If anyone finds any more... let me know... Im always happy to make an offer and purchase paddles for my collection.  Im making circles of paddles with  in each circle.

Rush the Freshmen in the Spring and have them move into the House in the Fall as Sophomores.  Evict the NannyStateRA.  Deferring Freshmen Rush until Spring may be better for the Freshmen and better for the Chapter.  Having the first semester to acclimate to the rigors of college academics gives Freshmen time to build a GPA cushion in advance of Pledging.

9021258,0,t3_53sj18,Im not a veteran but my chapter had  vets in it when I graduated ages   marines  Soldiers an Airman and a Squid  of them served at least one tour in either either Iraq or Afghanistan if memory serves me. They loved it and we loved having them. All of them had a shit ton of tattoos could out drink Irish dock workers and were not creepy at all. They brought a lot to the brotherhood and definitely made it stronger as a result.Yes they were constantly buying alcohol for their pledge brothers and yes Im sure it was annoying but not one of them ever hinted at regretting their decision. As far as paying for stuff I know at least one of them used some money from his GI Bill to pay for dues  of them re enlisted in the national guard and the airman was still serving the rest of his contract out in the reserves at a local air force base and I know that got in the way of him being available for some stuff he once planned out our entire homecoming weekend and had to miss out because of Uncle Sam. Not sure if any of that helped but you should be fine to go through rush and while the brotherhood aspect will definitely not replace what you had in the Marines it is surly a good time none the less. Oh and as far as hazing goes having served two tours I dont think you should worry about the hazing not only because Im sure you can probably take it but your pledge master probably wont subject you to some things for fear of triggering PTSD. Not saying you have it but it happened to one guy during an exercise and it was a very scary situation for everyone involved needless to say we learned our lesson in that department. ,Frat,d7w7pmu,7,t5_2s0mx

10083277,0,t1_dblt2rz,Fair assessment. The reason I gave advice to look for jobs outside of your major is because its quite possible that there may be a shortage of available positions in certain areas. For instance I majored in a very interesting field that had great job security government jobs but the issue was jobs were few and far between thus for the few available positions open I was competing with people who had higher degree levels than I did more experience in the industry already etc. and thus I wasnt getting very far. This forced me to have to look outside of this career path and thats when I realized that if I would have just done that in the first place I wouldnt have been stressing out about getting a job because I found out that was actually a fair amount of jobs out there I just wasnt looking in the right place. By not limiting yourself to a certain field like computer science you now have opened yourself up to many more opportunities.My comments about entry level sales in  was not a jab at sales professionals some people are actually very good at it and can make a lot of money. More so I was just getting at taking any job just because you might have an offer versus waiting for the correct opportunity. I saw many peers take jobs they were on the fence about in January just for the sake of not having to continue looking for one when they could have gone on and kept searching to find something better later on. ,Frat,dblvc5z,1,t5_2s0mx
10083318,0,t1_dblt8qw,  I would suggest putting a picture on there I dont work in recruitment primarily so I couldnt tell you if it will actively hurt you but if it were me I would put one up.   If they have given you a time frame of when they will contact you dont plan on getting anything until that time many offices run on skeleton crews around this time of year but two months does seem a little odd to me. However that does not mean you shouldnt continue searching. I did that for one job and it took away about a month of me searching when I could have found something else and it sucked that much more when I got the rejection email. As far as follow ups I typically had a  day rule so if I was told I would hear back on a Monday and didnt I would wait until Wednesday to send a follow up email. If you dont hear back after that within a business day its usually a sign to move on. ,Frat,dblvj2g,2,t5_2s0mx

I only knew a few people in my frat after rush but now I can say that nearly every person in my house is a great friend. Id say try to figure out which houses you want to keep coming back to an prioritize them over just random houses. Dont be a slave to tiers and definitely dont use greekrank.com. It shouldnt be too hard to tell which houses you connect with. Personally I had no trouble handling the load of rush and I always had a great time going out. ,Frat,dey3hwa,1,t5_2s0mx

11236617,0,t3_60ai42,Im a Cuse alum dont join a professional fraternity they are lame as fuck you pay dues every semester. the dues vary by fraternity. ask how much dues are when you rush. the biggest benefit of joining is not being a gdi.  syracuse is really tolerant when it comes to guys with different ethnic backgroundsexuality. learn to laugh at yourself like everyone else be cool and youll be fine. dont be a nerd. do be ready to have a good time. talk to as many people as you can when you rush. be open and honest. ask questions. try to get a sense of the house the people that make it up and choose which house to pledge based on fit and not reputation on campus. ,Frat,df5nl32,9,t5_2s0mx

11666761,0,t1_dghy9we,Real talk though some of the numbers there are accurate for instance the Fraternity members are x more likely to commit rape bit is based off Foubert Newberry amp Tatum  Loh Gidycz Lobo amp Luthra Granted those were  years ago and I dont know the methodology used for those studies. But it seems like fraternities have really upped their game on trying to address sexual assault so Id be interested to see if the stats are still the same. I think the problem is one that at least the majority of chapters Im familiar with have begun to take really seriously but its still our responsibility to address it in a healthy way amongst our members and also not to bid douchebag rapist geeds. ,Frat,dgify0v,18,t5_2s0mx
