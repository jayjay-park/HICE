4651748,0,t3_3enal9,Ive been in a LDR for two years and were getting married in  weeks! We never went more than  months apart which was really nice. But just keep in touch we used Viber for phone calls all the time and I treated Skype as more of a date. But if you can easily communicate it shouldnt be a problem. We talked every single day that was really nice As far as meeting in person you will be nervous and it will be awkward. The first time maybe a few hours max. Every time we met it was awkward but it quickly went from a few hours of awkwardness to only minutes. This time we met and it was only strange for a few seconds until we felt natural together imo. Just have fun ,LDR,ctgwwus,1,t5_2rx8p

And the other tone being kinda filled with resent and anger. Its ok to put both. Love is so damn complicated you probably need both but try and keep it in two seperate parts in the letter. Else it might seem like you are confuse when he reads it.,LDR,d4a9xbe,2,t5_2rx8p
8541163,0,t3_4wnwlp,We were childhood friends. Then chatted a little in high school. Then reconnected in adulthood at a wedding and decided to try dating over the distance.  Its new and exciting and a little scary but I like to think having so much shared history will help us sustain.,LDR,d697psh,3,t5_2rx8p

11102398,0,t1_deqd92u,Its not a common thing between us I would say we have just done it  times in  months and I dont remember if she did the same so I guess not. But last time I just couldnt handle it anymore because we are going through a rough path and we were on the phone arguing and trying to solve our problems and she started texting constantly while I was talking all the time she texted. I dont mind if she texts a couple of times I swear I dont have a problem with that but seriously we are thousands of miles apart we are not in our best moment give me at least a fuckin hour of your time. Is that so difficult to do? Am I asking too much?She called again today and did the same I dropped the call with the excuse of a meeting. I guess she noticed that the tone of my voice changed so she tried to put me in context of what she was talking.,LDR,deqg3ya,3,t5_2rx8p
11234675,0,t1_df5dkm3,Thanks for the advice. She already has feelings for this guy while also acknowledging its only temporary.So I need to make her realize where she is going and that if she continues in this direction she may lose us both.Me and my gf are inexperienced were  so we make errors. Its difficult because we grow one at a time. She went abroad because I went so that she wont feel left behind. She made an enormous step out of her comfort zone its my turn to keep up with her. It forces me to also gain experience on a terrain I was not envisaging. Oh well maybe I take it too seriously and shouldnt think too much like she does because Im the only one complaining.Its like we need to mirror each other to stay together. I should work on my personal growth while not staying too far from hers. Its a difficult equilibrium.,LDR,df5fo43,1,t5_2rx8p
