4215826,0,t1_cs02f5q,So I actually found some used ataforma stainless steel molds on Ebay and just purchased them! Theyre wacky shaped and are missing the stick holder but hey  bucks for  x molds  Now comes the fun of waiting for them to arrive and finding dry ice in my home. For some reason city grocery stores dont really sell it. Maybe getting an ice cream truck to share?  ,icepops,cs0sdpa,2,t5_2ud26
