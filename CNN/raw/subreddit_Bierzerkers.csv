3295102,0,t3_2xk9um,Thanks for the feedback.  We were feeling some of this as well.  Next playtest we addressed some of these issues.   There is no ammo system currently but scoundrel now will have a cadence to his throws and the huntress will have a run speed debuff while firing.  Along with a bunch of other fixes as well.,Bierzerkers,cp3v9pa,1,t5_335js
