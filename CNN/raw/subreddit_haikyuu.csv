5805454,0,t1_cxgowhm,gtUshi is definitely in that top three and quite possibly the number one spot.I doubt hes anything other than exactly rd place to be honest. For one it would be a bizarre move on Furudates part to put the strongest spiker right in Miyagi. But from an actual mangaevidenced reason this panel probably sums it up quite a bit Ushijima is closest to the viewers perspective symbolically placing him closest to the skill level of Karasuno. Other spikers are farther away because theres a greater gap in skill between Hinata and them.  Ushijima is referred to only as one of the top three rather than the best or any other name referring to him as number one. Im sure than in the Haikyuu world there is a definitive ranking of the top three at least so if Ushijima was at the top of that three than at the very least Bokuto would know.  Why would Furudate foreshadow two spikers that would be considered inferior to Ushijima?Not to downplay Ushijimas accomplishments as a character of course hes absolutely insanely powerful and captains a brutally strong team but there are definitely bigger bads out there.,haikyuu,cxgpzfb,9,t5_2ygi4

Ive been furiously typing messages to utheharuwhocanread while Ive been reading the fic linked above but I honestly think it deserves a public comment here. Its quite possibly the single greatest Haikyuu fic Ive read and Ive read a hell of a lot. The characters are true to their originals and not a thing felt out of place. There is an excellently handled OC who I have grown to love  and I dont normally like OCs much. But Taiga is fantastic. The plot itself may read basic its a story of how someone comes out of the closet but the finer plot details give it so much more depth. I laughed. Mostly at TsukkiI and Hinata in amongst the generally lighthearted writing. I cried. Mostly because of Seijoh mostly because of the stories that are wrapped up in there between Oikawa and Iwaizumi. I had to take a break after one of the chapters because it was hitting a sore spot. I got taken back to when I was  and trying to figure out if I liked girls or not and how to come out to my friends about it. Its handled so well. This comment wont do it justice but please give OUT! a go if you have some time. Its worth it.,haikyuu,d6gvjhq,2,t5_2ygi4
8793833,0,t1_d6xjqk2,Ultimately Slam Dunk set the standards for shonen sport series. While i really love Haikyuu there is no denying the quality of Slam Dunk particularly how it handles Hanamichis development which is realistic and natural.

Or if anything theyll have those unflashy ones too like Daichi or maybe even the more plain ones who are all tired of being a loser like IkejiriOhgiMinami?.On the current nd yrs becoming rd yrs I can see them being pulled strongly together for having Ennoshita as their captain and Tanaka and Nishinoya acting as their vice captains. Id also love to see our Tanaka become the awesome ace of Karasuno so badly As for Hinata and the others they will continue to add and develop their weapons.

9182331,0,t1_d8flasj,Well... The main reason people go for forearm receives is because you need the ball to be above you for an overhead one and thats not common when the ball is going fast. In the case of the last second trayectory change messing you up is mostly in the floater case because you have to push the ball up hardernot just receive it and if you do so with a bad angle it will go to some random place that you didnt want it to go and without gaining much height instead if you go overhead you can quickly adapt and worst case scenario it goes in another direction but still up.,haikyuu,d8fxf4w,3,t5_2ygi4

9920615,0,t3_5hfqx1,Woah. This finale was everything one couldve hoped for it to be and more. Im amazed at how thoroughly consistent this show is with delivering quality contenteven outdoing itself at times and exceeding expectations. Still overwhelmed by andgiddy from all that went down in this episode even though the actual outcome of the match was no surprise. I mean from the standpoint of plot progression it wouldnt have made sense to have Karasuno lose at this point and drag them back to square one.But hoo boy those few moments of being on the edge with my hands clamped over my mouth in the first half were such a treat. A throwback to the final rally of the Karasuno vs Seijoh match in S whose outcome was obvious too but it did such a great job at making the viewer feel invested that even though I knew in the back of my mind that Karasuno would win no matter what it still managed to get me tensed up as if what lay ahead was something totally unpredictable. And the show pulled it off once again. How do you do it Haikyuu?So much impact packed into every scene... All these emotions... I had maintained all this while that I couldnt bring myself to care for the Shiratorizawa team in ways I did for Seijoh or any of the other opposing teams and I still stand by that. BUT. Now that were actually facetoface with the results of the match I do feel a bit sad for their loss. I think I somehow ended up developing a soft spot for the simpleminded and gullible Tsutomu with his adorableness in particular and seeing him bawling his eyes out was kinda heartbreaking. ,haikyuu,db0oj9e,2,t5_2ygi4

10245243,0,t1_dc5bguf,As the coach stated any team will get used to the quick attack after a while. Im not disputing Aones and Levs agility they are definitely agile for their size but I dont think that have that special athleticism that Hinata has. Pretty much everyone who sees him agrees hes a freak athlete.  The Minus tempo is possible because Hinata is fast enough to get in position and jump to hit Kageyamas tosses its both of them working together not just Kageyama otherwise Asahi and Tanaka would be hitting them aswell. The original quick was Kageyamas king toss which only Hinata had the ability to hit. Guys like Kindaichi couldnt hit it because they werent fast enough to get there. More proof of Hinatas speed is when his middle school friend didnt set the ball properly and Hinata sprinted to the other side of the court jumped and hit the ball. The way Lev is right now there is no way he can do what Hinata did. Yes Lev doesnt have to travel that far to receive a ball but Hinata can easily match that with how fast he is. Pretty much agree with your last point. ,haikyuu,dc5csn9,2,t5_2ygi4

10405518,0,t1_dcmxcxb,The dynamic between Hinata and Kageyama is in my opinion one of the best things about this story in general. They truly push each other to new heights. Its amazing. So its always great to see their trust shown off some more. I hope they continue to push each other for a long time to come. I know the story set us up originally to hope to see them face off  but man. I honestly just dont even want to see that anymore. They are entierly too good together. Ive said it before  but one of my favorite moments in the whole series is when Ukai first sees them playing together and comments that they must have been friends in Jr. High No longer than that elementary school. And when told that they just met he responds with thats cruel. They are two people who work soooo well together that the thought of them having to go without the other becomes really sad. You start to realize how much farther each may have come already not just in volleyball but in friendship if they had known each other sooner. Its really beautiful. And sad. I dont want to see them face off anymore. Just keep on pushing each other even higher and working together. ,haikyuu,dcnj6vp,10,t5_2ygi4

10598419,0,t1_dd924ho,I think for me personally I expected a much better quality of play from Karasuno after such exicting matches from Seijoh and Shiratorizawa. The game feels kinda of like a giant clown fiesta where both teams show a bit of lack luster performance. But I think its to be expected from nerves and the first few rounds despite it being Nationals. P,haikyuu,dd958zc,6,t5_2ygi4

10752890,1,t1_ddp26fw,Im up for a debate too but you wont find many points of discussion that doesnt come down to preference. I think Hinata and Yachi are incredibly annoying. I get annoyed when theyre onscreen and I really prefer the rallies when Hinata isnt part of the rotation. I think Bokuto is pretty annoying too and I actually got kind of annoyed when Takeda was like You almost want to root for him even though hes on the other team! like the writer was forcing me to feel that wayKiyokos a noncharacter I think Takeda is also annoying and Sugawara feels way too...dramatic for me? Dont really know how to explain it but I was just cringing the entire time when he was subbed in for Kageyama at the end of S. I respect him for sticking with the team despite being a more useless member and being benched for a first yearI liked Kageyama more at the beginning but I think the writer almost flanderized him by emphasizing more of his weirdawkwardpolite aspects as the series went on. Plus hes not a great setter BECAUSE HE ILLEGALLY TOUCHES THE BALL FOR TOO LONGI read the comment as in any other story the characters wouldnt be as interesting or complex so Asahi would be my favorite. I couldve misread it but it seems needlessly superfluous to say in a story where the characters are worse than Asahi my favorite character would be Asahi? Like...duh? And does the bestfavorite distinction really matter? Nobody can determine who the best character is so when somebody says they think a character is the best theyre probably referring to their favorite. And yes if someone said that theyre only watching shows where the addition of Asahi would make him the best character I would tell them that they need to watch morebetter shows,haikyuu,ddp2twa,-1,t5_2ygi4

10893233,0,t3_5vj5iq,As you said  You should have come to Shiratorizawa memes are my favorite too. In particular this one in which Ushijima bakes a cake. Theres also one where Oikawa on the toilet and goes to grab the paper and it says you should have some to Shiratorizawa on it and that ones makes me laugh so hard. I cant seem to find it right now though. ,haikyuu,de3k5rt,19,t5_2ygi4

10923281,0,t3_5vyogn,Lots of people are betting Dateko to crush Karasuno actually but the real question is how strong is the Dateko Wall? I might get downvoted for this but it just seems they are favorites because it was stated that theyd be a major threat next tournament. I do think the wall is strong almost DBZ powers strong but a block can only get you so far right? Seems to me atleast that Dateko only have a wall and a few quirks while Karasuno has the minus tempo along with high calibrated mix ups. To me it just seems unless Dateko start pulling minus tempo cards their only win is from a sloppy Karasuno but thats just me P,haikyuu,de6ns8n,3,t5_2ygi4

11220197,0,t1_df37dfm,I dont know if itd be this year but I hope eventually theres some moment where Kageyama shows he truly trusts Tsukki enough for even Tsukki to believe it. That alone would do a world of good because a lot of the issue between the two IMO is Tsukki projecting his own sense of inferiority onto Kags remarks and not believing that Kageyama genuinely respects him as an equal. And of course Kags tendency to be bossy doesnt help.Hopefully Furudate doesnt intend to keep their relationship as is because if only for the sake of the team its something that should be addressed. I wouldnt want to lose all the saltiness either but development would be good and its been set up to come to a head at some point.,haikyuu,df3sn4p,1,t5_2ygi4
