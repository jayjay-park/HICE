9341103,0,t3_58eyu3,A chapter that comes to mind would be Appendix E Mindful Review. In it is described quite a nuanced view on morality and how wholesome and unwholesome aspects of the activities in life and mind  may be better understood to choose toward a better path from small actions to large. On using the power of a skillfuly developed mind in meditation for gain in the world well if ones main goal is awakening and as long as these extra pursuits dont interfere with that then I say have fun with it. Part of what makes life colorful are those who are willing to develop great skill in various fields. Going farther and exploring past the limits of those who reached them.As long as ones pursuits and the events caused by them arent contributing to suffering in a way that can be chosen not to contribute to then I dont see any problems.This is all in theory from me though. Im not yet at an advanced stage where I look back from experience of deep states in daily life. perhaps I dont give myself enough credit though Personally some of the things Ill use skills gained from meditation for are to become as well rounded as I can be in relation to fitness and health then become skilled in learning in ways that I had never developed before I was never a great student so that would be enjoyable and useful. Then Ill see what to aim for after that. ,TheMindIlluminated,d901w7v,1,t5_3f6ws

9656236,0,t3_5damvi,I agree with uflyingneko Maybe you want to practice with the intention of pleasure and relaxation with peripheral awareness a few times until it becomes a part of your nature and then move on to engaging with the breath. When Im meditating in the subway its a bit hard for me to direct my attention to my breath as so many things are going on. Mostly Im listening to the announcements on what stops have come. This practice helped me to engage with breath at home i.e. in a quite environment. I would like to break things into further baby steps. Thats my approach to things. ,TheMindIlluminated,da3bz54,1,t5_3f6ws
9726291,0,t1_dabp81n,Cool thanks. I was surprised to see this round has a  participant cap which surprised me because for  I was expecting a smaller more personalizedindividualized course. The videos are recorded and you meet with a peer group not with the instructors which I take it is just him and his assistant. Do the peer groups even have any kind of TA or mentor that has taken the program before? Thats crazy hes pulling in m on this one course. I guess if the content works thats what ultimately matters but Im having a little sticker shock. Im still very interested and have until Monday to decide for this next round. I guess what it ultimately comes down to is if I have  to spend on meditation would it go further taking this course or using that on various Skype lessons or retreats with TMI teachers over the course of a year or two. I could see how getting an awakening or partial awakening experience early would make you very motivated and maybe speed up your progress because youve experienced exactly what you are striving for and trying to stabilize. My only other concern is how biased his awakening stats are due to the price of the program as this can often cause buyers to postrationalize and not feel bad. If the TMI book cost  I wonder if wed see the same awakening rate in the first year or less assuming the cohorts this claim was made on were similarly priced. Did your cohort have the biofeedback stuff or is that starting in the upcoming round for the first time? ,TheMindIlluminated,dabz8w2,1,t5_3f6ws
9973146,0,t1_db7fs74,Thanks for the suggestion! I have read the handouts previously and found them useful. Is it possible to pinpoint which of the talks I might focus in on as there are quite a few of them? If not no worries!These experiences in the past few days have felt a little revelatory. As you say its hard to know but whatever these experiences I had were there were a few gasp moments for me.,TheMindIlluminated,db7j0s5,1,t5_3f6ws
10128970,0,t1_dbp6c8k,Would you say that the jhana  the whole body jhana at stage   fulfils those same criteria and that if one can do both activities jhana and fullbody breath the jhana is the preferable choice?I tried the whole body breathing technique today after not having done it for a month or two been dealing with subtle distractions lately and looking for ways to counter them and found myself entering jhana. From my single experience today I couldnt see how to stop that from happening  focusing on the wholebody breath just seemed naturally to go towards jhana.Is the jhana the next step of the full body breathing from which I will get the same benefit or are they separate practices? The book implies the only difference between them is that in wholebody breath you return to the breath at the nose in whole body jhana you stay with the whole body and try to enter the jhana.I am able to enter I think all four pleasure jhanas Leigh Brasingtons versions which seem similar but a little different to Culadasas and I wonder if I would get more benefit from doing them for more time rather than the lite whole body jhanas. As I say been noticing subtle distractions and looking for the best antidote. Perhaps it could be to enter and stay longer in the most advanced jhana I can?Thanks!,TheMindIlluminated,dbrt6qz,1,t5_3f6ws
10150276,0,t3_5la0p5,gt I am interested in the fact that Culadasa says Leigh Brasington taught him the jhanasCuladasa says this about the instructions to entering the pleasure jhanas The credit for this description of how to enter the pleasure jhanas goes to leigh Brasington from whom I learned it and who had originally learned the method from Ayya Khema,TheMindIlluminated,dbul0a0,1,t5_3f6ws
10206733,0,t3_5kz96z,Hi... sounds to me like youre at stages  and  probably more at .  As I understand it this depends on the degree of your forgetting... if awareness of the breath completely disappears during this time youre at stage .  If awareness of the breath still exists in the background i.e. if at the instant that remindfulness  occurs you find that you have a memory of the lost breaths then youre at stage .I dont see this mentioned a lot but memory is a good indicator of awareness... things that are in background awareness can be remembered afterward even if the attention was elsewhere.  Things that cant be remembered were not even in background awareness.Footnote  The word remindfullness comes from James Austin author of Zen and the Brain... mindfullness reminds you of your breath when your attention is wandering so maybe it should be called remindfullness at least in this context.,TheMindIlluminated,dc0znla,2,t5_3f6ws
10461580,0,t1_dctpc5u,Thanks! I might try another technique in the future but for now I prefer to stick to techniques from the same program. If you have time Id love to hear more about your experiences with TMIs walking meditation.,TheMindIlluminated,dctxd5c,1,t5_3f6ws
10519080,0,t3_5qe7m3,Working memory is defined as the part of shortterm memory which is concerned with immediate conscious perceptual and linguistic processing. If meditation improves working memory wouldnt this suggest our immediate conscious perceptual processing increases resulting in reduced mind wandering and increased stability ability to remain presentexperience the immediate unfolding world?,TheMindIlluminated,dd0g9gp,1,t5_3f6ws
10600023,0,t1_dd98z67,Right feeling calm is nice but my objective is probably pacification of the senses. Insight is welcome too of course.So... about subtle dullness. I was guessing it isnt my problem because I feel aware of my full body. After a few minutes it actually becomes a rather strong feeling much weaker than attention but still sharp enough.Also my mind doesnt feel clouded at all. Instead sometimes it gets a bit jittery. Meaning that I start having many random thoughts instead of being calm and silent.My experience with dullness is rather the opposite. It feels like a very soft attention narrow. And my mind feels clouded and I space out like falling asleep. But my current experience is far from this dullness.,TheMindIlluminated,dd9b7j1,1,t5_3f6ws

10883171,0,t3_5vjf5p,Great question. Something I have often wondered about since I used to have really troublesome sinuses growing up. A friend of mine who deals with allergies all the time and has been meditating for years says the neti pot is his best friend. Perhaps you could try that.,TheMindIlluminated,de2isit,1,t5_3f6ws

11575648,0,t1_dg7x5xi,Are you saying its not dullness or am I confused about strongsubtle dullness and their antidotes?By the way is there something we can do to support you and other teachers in training? As in donations transcribing Culadasa talks and so on.,TheMindIlluminated,dg83thw,1,t5_3f6ws
11657075,0,t3_66aijl,gt How can I best distance my happiness and sense of well being from my situation so that if or when I feel it slipping away or changing that I wont respond in an unhelpful or negative way? Learn Jhana. Jhana is meant to supplement worldly pleasure so we can detach from it. Eventually with continually deepening insight we can let go of Jhana as well.  To put it another way You cant let go of everything right away. So you learn to change what you cling to for now. And what you change your clinging to is the breath  and the satisfaction you can feel in your body from it. From working with the breath you get a new much more stable satisfaction and this satisfaction will give you space for insight which brings Awakening and the end of suffering.  Here is a related talk by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. ,TheMindIlluminated,dghce53,3,t5_3f6ws
