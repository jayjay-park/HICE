7323,0,t1_cef9cty,What he said. Youre better off investing in a DI and using that to go into the DAW. The sound you hear is the sound reflecting around the room bouncing off walls hitting your ears in a very specific way. The mic would only capture what is being emitted right in front of the amp. A DI would allow every bit of audio that your amp would usually produce to be captured inside Audacity. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cef9qjg,3,t5_2qmah

74827,0,t3_1uxp7r,Ive been experimenting for a while on getting a good sound and its not easy but the microphone is key as is a good audio interface to plug it into..  transferring by SD seems inefficient to me.    there are of course micing and room considerationsI would use any DAW that accepts plugins for processing the sound Im trying out ableton ATM and its ok for my purposes.  I record all the parts with a compression plugin and also EQ EQ has a high pass filter and boosts according to your ears and mix  I also cut out some frequency near Hz.   Next I arrange and pan the guitar parts two identical takes get panned about  ideally apply some adaptive multiband compression overall EQ maybe some limiting not necessary if your volumes are close to dBThis is maybe the best sound Ive got so far.  I think I can still improve it. add me to your soundcloud and Ill be glad to listen.any tips for me most welcome..except about singing not much i can do there   except try and get good vocal sound and mix.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cemy584,2,t5_2qmah

75643,0,t3_1uyui0,Putting too many things in the low end.The difference in hz between c and d are much smaller than the difference between c and d. Notes start having weird wobbly phase issues really easily and cloud up with fewer instruments.The lower you go the harder it is for speakers to recreate stuff accurately. So if you leave a bunch of low on the guitars have a big long kick sound and a bass going its going to sound very muddy and congested. I generally leave sub hz to no more than two instruments.Also like smegegy said the absolute best way to learn is by being terrible and learning from your own mistakes.

78646,0,t3_1uys87,A little different tip for the thread My friend is a professional wedding DJ. She told me that one of the most important things she learned on the job was how to corral kids. If there are children running around at the reception shell get them to sit lined up in front of the DJ table and play a quiet game or contest or something. Itll keep them out of trouble if theyre being too energetic at the end of dinner before the dancing starts or during the first bridegroom dance. Not a strict DJing tip per se but its something that ensures things go smoothly and the parentsbride will love you if you do it right.Also middle age people will want to dance to YMCA and Electric Slide and all the other cheesy songs like that so add them to your arsenal if you werent planning on it already.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cends3b,2,t5_2qmah

Really good means youre dedicated to your craft and are accomplished.  Professional means thats how you eat.  One doesnt really have much to do with the other.  Even touring pros playing their original music are fucking for money.  I know some guys like that and believe me theyd rather be home with their families rather than playing the same set of songs for the thousandth time to a crowd of kids on their phones.  But their pros and pros do it for money not fun.  The luxury of not fucking with something thats a pain in the ass or a bummer is not extended to pros.

If you are constantly work at improving your skills finishing songs and putting out music that will significantly improve your chances of getting a deal.That isnt to say that a degree is useless by any means it is a fantastic way to further your education and hone your skills.

This is like saying Weve determined that when people get off tempo they try to get back on tempo. I think the study displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the fact that musicians have an innate sense of flow based on how they hear the music. With that they will naturally play to a certain tempo.

230064,0,t1_cf4k9he,Actually in a blind Taste test of  classically trained violinists playing  violins a stradivarius and  others of the same era the violinists did not find anything special about the stradivarius and they all picked nonstradivarius as their favorite. of said violins sounded almost the same while one did sound very unique. They all thought the unique one was a stradivarius but it was actually on of his competitors.This was in a PBS documentary I since havent been able to find. The strdivarius thing is all marketing. Us musicians tend to fall for marketing gimmicks wives tales and stuff like that. Were a gullible and stupid bunch i suppose. Old guitars enjoy the same status often selling for hundreds of thousands depending on the year model make etc. For example the  Les Paul. One in just okay condition sells for the price of a house. This is because of its reputation despite the inconsistencies in manufacturing at the time and the dumb design techniques employed in that era.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cf4le3n,6,t5_2qmah

I admit when I was young and got Wish You Were Here in black plastic wrap with stickers postcards and two posters it was very cool.    Sgt.

If you need exclusivity to connect to an artist on a personal level you arent listening to the music for the sake of itself but rather for the product. If you care about your own influence on the artist you love you are listening to the music selfishly. I mean...the whole idea that these bands dont deserve or need fame is selfish. If they change because they get famous so be it. Sucks to be you if you dont like it anymore. They made great art they probably will continue to make great art and if you cant see the meaning in it because you cant shoot them a message on soundcloud anymore telling them how much you liked it thats your loss.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cfahzmm,2,t5_2qmah
289297,0,t1_cfajgbb,You know Netflix right? Are you familiar with the inner mechanism of how it works? Its not just a catalog of streaming movies and mailorder DVDs theres a massive database of user info that they analyze and manipulate in order to generate recommendations. You the user sees Action and Comedy but behind the scenes youre seeing arty indie comedies with a quirky female lead from the early s or blockbuster action movies with strong romantic elements from the s. By tagging each movie with appropriate metadata and crossreferencing viewing patterns theyre able to create a system of movie discovery not unlike what were discussing here.I think if it can be done with something as complex and nuanced as cinema it can certainly be done for music. Dont forget Netflix has been at it since  and is now a five billion dollar enterprise with  billion a year in revenue. Pandora by comparison has annual revenues of only half a billion and only just became profitable this last quarter. Few people even pay for Pandora there is no free Netflix. Its no wonder Pandora doesnt have as good a discovery system when theyre just scraping by on the arbitrage between ad revenue and licensing fees.Give it time. The digital music industry took a shitkicking from napster that simply didnt happen to hollywood given the bandwidth concerns. A k mp is in the minds of anyone who could get fistfulls even on dialup effectively worthless. Netflix would have been mailing CDs and tapes if dialup had been any worse but things being what they were now streaming video has a ten year headstart over streaming music. Thus Netflix has come up with a workable discovery system where no streaming music provider could possibly have the resources to develop thus far. And the idea that such a system could come from some plucky startup or worse the starryeyed navelgazing of some frustrated journalist is asinine. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cfar0oj,2,t5_2qmah

Humans dont have perfect timing to nail a run of notes like that some of them will be rushed and some will lag. Humans cant hit every note with the same hardness every time the start a run loud and then it fades down. Or it starts quietly and grows into a crescendo. Even for short runs like you have in the song every measure and beat has tension and release.The reverb does help the sound of the playing but it doesnt help the playing itself.not trying to be mean the song itself is great.

471469,0,t3_1zfa5g,I only have one side of this story but for the sake of conversation Im going to just assume everything youre saying is true.    Most of my friends have some sort of music projects at any given time.  If we expand that out to just artistic ventures in general I think the number hits .  All of my friends have real day jobs were mostly all in our thirties and it all works out.  I might be able to understand if you were a freeloading rentmoocher living at your girlfriends place trying to make it big while she works enough to pay for both of you the beginning of the movie Airheads if you will but if thats not the case then jesus christ.  You need a fucking outlet and theres no better time in your life to do so than later in life  you finally have life experience to give you perspective in your writing youve probably got enough years practice to make yourself not suck and you should be able to afford gear a lot easier than you could at say  years old.  This is prime band years right here so long as you keep your expectations realistic and dont go quitting your job in pursuit of a shitty record contract that youre never going to get.    Just make sure youre not completely or nearly completely neglecting your girlfriend because thats a good way to foster civil unrest in your domicile.  Try to communicate in advance about when youre going to be around and available and when youre going to be working on band stuff and try to make sure you make ample time for her every week.  Your real problem might not be band so much as it is unpredictable schedule due to hobbies and work which is a common relationship killer if not caught early.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cftuwne,1,t5_2qmah

People seem to think its as easy as opening up garage band and playing a melody laying down a drum track and exporting. In reality thats the tip of the iceberg. Learning how to mix properly is a huge beast that takes a long long time and a lot of hard work and practice to truly tackle.

629210,0,t3_21aj1h,I was a  year old punk kid in a fairly shitty poppunk band. First show of a  month tour helpfully booked by the label we had just informally signed to. The first two shows of the tour were canceled and we didnt find out about it until we were already packing the van. Decided to go ahead and leave and just hang out in Texas for a while before the first hopefully real show in New Orleans. Arrive in New Orleans and follow the directions the promoter had sent us this was before Mapquest was widely used. It is an apartment. It looks like an old ladys place. We somehow come to discover that it is the promoters grandmothers house. Promoter will not answer his phone. We set out in search of the venue. The only place we really know to go is the French Quarter. We start asking around. We have two or three bouncer dudes at various bars say to us Ive literally been in every bar in this town and Ive never even heard of that place. Finally stumble upon the Dixie Tavern which is a fairly well known punk bar. They of course know where our venue is and give us directions. Turns out its in the lower th ward which can be a scary place if youve never been to New Orleans. We arrive at he bar The Hi Ho Lounge which is actually still there and supposedly a fairly cool place. We set up and play a show for just the bartender who was nice. We dont even ask for money afterward and just leave. The next show is in our home town which is a nice change of pace. After the show the guy who booked the tour calls to explain that hes been having trouble booking the shows he promised us. Turns out we have like  confirmed dates over the twomonth span. We go to sleep after debating our options. Wake up in the morning to find that some people had hijacked some planes and flew them into the World Trade Center. That was kind of bummer. Label guy calls that evening to tell us that he wants his label to only release Christian music from now on and if we want him to put out our stuff we have to stop using curse words in our songs. We use some curse words in the conversation with him. A couple of days later our singer decided hed had enough of this bullshit quit and sold the van. TLDR Played a show for no one in New Orleans which lead to our whole tour falling apart and maybe caused  to happen?.editI should also point out that I had already quit school and my job at this point. And I know this story isnt  on topic but the epic bumout began with the show that literally no one showed up to and it did not end for a very long time. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cgbsivq,2,t5_2qmah

650145,0,t3_21le7i,I cant really speak for Ratatat dont listen to them enough.To be fair I cant speak for Moderat either as Im only theorising but this is my opinion of what makes a Moderat tune so clean and crisp. Moderat are very particular in letting each voice be it a synth a drum sound a vocal line have plenty of space in the frequency band that it is most prominent so the sounds are never fighting for volume or definition. Giving each instrument space is kind of common practice if you come from a more studio background recording bands but with computers and electronic production people tend to absolutely load their tracks with sounds and synths without any consideration for frequency space in a lot of genres this is probably the desired effect but personally I absolutely hate it. Try to keep that in mind when producing something. If you start adding in new synths or voices have a think about how it will impact on the sounds nearest to them. Another little thing to note is that Moderat use a lot of analog gear that have very rich upper partials and harmonics that frequency band that people call the air or presence. You can still emulate this style of sound in the box but again you just need to consider all the instruments that are fighting one another and how they interact. Im sure others will disagree or add their own additions but for me thats the stuff that make Moderat one of the most consistent and refreshing groups around besides their actual musical talent too!. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cge66oc,5,t5_2qmah

Modes are pretty rigid and are used according to certain melodic and harmonic rules. Pentatonic scales and whole tone scales are scales but not modes.As for the difference between Aeolian mode and minor they arent the same. There are several notes used in the minor scale that are not in Aeolian mode. We learn these as harmonic and melodic minor scales but really they are all attempts to simplify the harmonic and melodic awesomeness that is Minor. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cgeyzwa,3,t5_2qmah

699378,0,t3_225znk,So as syberdragon pointed out you only have two things here that make waveforms the wave generator and function generator.Judging by the text on the front panel we can rule out the usefulness of the Wavetek due to its frequency its  megahertz not kilohertz so its  times too fast for us to hear.  A real shame considering all its waveform shaping and modulating options!So that leaves you with just the Heathkit function generator.  It looks like it can generate frequencies in a range that we can hear plus lower ones to modulate another oscillator and the like! but without all those tasty options the Wavetek has its probably going to be a plain sine wave.Unless youre Delia Derbyshire and youre happy to spend hours getting a decent sound out of a sine wave generator that has no notion of say musical pitch or stopping and starting youre probably best off selling this gear to someone who can actually make use of it and using the money to buy a simple synthesiser of some kind.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cgjrsmh,18,t5_2qmah

If so you want to look at interfaces with  preamps. I dont know how many microphones you put on your kit but I would assume that at some point you will be using at least  or  channels just for the drums.Heres an example. This is a list of all the preamp USB . interfaces available on BampH Photo Video. Ignore the first one I dont know why its showing up in the list.EDIT The list on BampH is not a complete list of the interfaces that fit the criteria. There are many others but this list is a decent representation of the price range and feature sets you can expect to encounter. Another budget interface that is big bang for the buck is the Behringer FCA Many people are quick to shit on everything Behringer makes but things in the audio world are not the same now that they were  years ago.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cgl7lu4,2,t5_2qmah
716307,0,t1_cglkuze,Yeah not saying it cant be done.  There are a lot of reasons not to want to play live and Im at a point right now where I think its a big hassle generally but I think that if someone offers me  to play a concert Im gonna take it.  But Im not trying to make a living as a musician but I have.  Im not playing live unless its over the internet right now but that doesnt mean I wont play a show if I feel like its worth it.  I feel like if your main objection to playing live is not regarding the hassle but maybe just being nervous and you cant do it with stage fright youre going to have to get your chops somewhere.  I think if you are a very precise player who just reads the hell out of music and lead sheets then you can cut it in the studio and by studio i mean when someone is paying for that studio time and you are on the clock otherwise if theres an issue with the pressure to perform in front of people then its not going to be an easier than getting up on a stage and blowing it with a band cause its your time to shine.  sure studio tricks can fix a lot of stuff these days but that costs time too.... hopefully you can nail it.   you probably didnt get a chance to run through the songs live either because you probably wouldnt be in the band since you wont play out.  yes you can be a studio musician but you have to work really really hard at your instrument and be able to realize someone elses creative vision without wasting their time.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cglp4fm,1,t5_2qmah

789062,0,t3_232wm0,Good question tough to answer.Heres the thing...as a game composer the upfront fee tends to represent the vast majority of the money youll ever see from a project unless youre lucky and the soundtrack gets some big attention.That being the case I always try to negotiate to keep soundtrack sales. Unlike filmbroadcast work game audio doesnt produce royalties either so its important to set up an income system that provides residual earnings somehow...soundtracks are essentially the only way outside of rare performance bonuses extra money for every x game units sold.Depending on the developers involvement this can flex. If they release the soundtrack themselves and do a big marketing push for it they deserve a cut and that can be anywhere from  in my experience.Most times though its up to the composer to release things so it makes sense that we keep the proceeds. And developers are almost always willing to send a few tweets out especially if youve been awesome to work with.This all depends on the terms of your contract of course. In other words ask your developer to what extent they intend to be involved in the release of the soundtrack and decide a fair percentage accordingly. If theyre handsoff the money is yours. If theyre helping determine how much of your ongoing income that help is worth.At the end of the day again youre not talking big money on the back end either way but small ongoing income from multiple albums does become meaningful after a while.Source I do this for a living,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cgtyxyl,1,t5_2qmah

910142,0,t3_24jgvg,A good tip I picked up from roey izhakis book is to automate a small increase in the overhead mic levels on choruses or on the hatcymbal tracks if using programmed drums. It gives a sense of energy if the chorus is lacking a bit of punch.Sometimes I use a different approach raising the high frequency levels of parts of the mix during important parts to make them stand out a bit. I do the reverse with basses sometimes taking out a bit of low energy in repetitive parts then allowing through in the dramatic bits. EQ and compression automation can really spice things up as an alternative to fader automation. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ch7qm1g,5,t5_2qmah

941923,0,t1_chaxq9l,I pretty much agree on this. If You can think of a good reason to play for free getting your name out there etc making contacts for future etc. you should do that. If you do at least hint that if everything goes well and they want you to play again in the future you can negotiate for the price. If you play for free many times the problem is as Astrixtc said it will be hard to start charging suddenly. Not only that but the promoters and organizers tend to talk with each other and spread the word that you are playing for free. That means it might be hard to get any other than free gigs in your local area.I guess my point is that you should always have a reason to play for free otherwise charge money.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,chbcpmj,1,t5_2qmah

953893,0,t3_250o2m,To be honest Id reconsider going to school if I were you.  Im a huge proponent of education but you have to make sure things make sense. Here are a few things to consider. If youre looking for something thats less hours and less intense than a traditional job youre barking up the wrong tree with music.  Im a pro in a circle of pros and most of us have day jobs or some sort and then gigdo session workteach lessons on top of that. You can set a lot of your own hours but plan on setting about  of them a week if you want to get anywhere.  If youre lucky after  years youll be able to cut that back to . When it comes to music unless youre trying out for a symphony no one cares if you have a degree.  There are much cheaper ways to learn than college.  For some careers you need the proof that a degree provides in music you dont. In this day in age going to school is about preparing you for a career.  Its really expensive in terms of time and money.  If you cant work the career it might not be worth the investment.Personally If I were in your shoes Id either switch to studying something that youd be able to have a career in or drop out and study music on your terms.  Get private lessons or take some classes at a community college.  Dont overpay for a degree if you cant put it to use.  ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,chcprzc,8,t5_2qmah

So last year I got myself a Zoom R digital  track recorder cost me just under  which is remarkably similar to my old  track machines but a hellava lot more productive. I program drums on the Linux MultiMedia Studio free DAW useful for a lot more things too transfer it to the Zoom as a wav record instruments and vocals then transfer everything back to the laptop to mix and master. Im no production genius by any stretch of the imagination but I like the sounds I get and its a fairly simplistic process that wont have you pouring over manuals for hours trying to figure things out.

With floatingpoint representation the placement of the decimal point can float relative to the significant digits of the number. For example a fixedpoint representation with a uniform decimal point placement convention can represent the numbers . . . etc whereas a floatingpoint representation could in addition represent . . .  etc. As such floating point can support a much wider range of values than fixed point with the ability to represent very small numbers and very large numbers.FixedPoint vs FloatingPoint Digital Signal Processing,WeAreTheMusicMakers,chlnqji,2,t5_2qmah

1070109,0,t3_26cp6v,First piece of advice listen to your favourite electronic artists and observe how their songs are arranged. Making a jump from a rock setting to an electronic setting doesnt have to be a difficult thing. In fact since you will have a different approach to composingarranging you might end up crafting a very unique style. Let us consider a regular piece rock outfit sans vocals. You have the drums bass and two guitars or a guitar and a keyboard. Drums and bass in rock arent that much different from that of electronica. Theyre both elements that give the song rhythm and tie the entire arrangement together. Arranging guitar and piano in electronica terms is where you can get really creative. For example with guitar since you are not bound by the limitations of the fretboard anymore you can go crazy with impossibletofinger chords and what not. Alternatively you can transpose rock guitar as a lead electronic instrument like a sawtooth. A lot of electronic music has a tendency to be repetitive building on a particular beat and progression as opposed to the more maximalist tendencies of a lot of rock. Consider this and then throw this rule out of the window. Write an electronic song as you would write a rock song. Experimentation in composition and arrangement is key. Really put in lots of hours in composition and arrangement. You can have the best gear and stuff but none of it will matter if your composition and arrangement isnt effective. Stop thinking in terms of whether something is rock or electronic and start thinking of how to compose and arrange well. Have fun making music! ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,chpxc8h,2,t5_2qmah

1208748,0,t3_27xxvs,gtAlso how can I create cohesion between riffspartssections and string them together in a logical manner? Music isnt logic.Music is sound. Logic is logic. And rubadub is rubadub.If the sections sounds like they work together thats all the logic you need.If youre not sure then record what youve got move onto something else and come back to it after a week or so. Youll know as soon as you hear it if its working. You establish cohesion using repetition and change.Lets say you have a bar riff. You can repeat this riff exactly as it is notefornote soundforsound or you can do something else.But something else doesnt have to be something completely different. You could keep some element of the riff going  Repeat just the rhythm with different notes  Repeat just the melody with a different rhythm  Repeat the chords with a different melody and rhythm  Use different instrumentation  Use different emphases  Change exactly one note in the melody and see where it takes you  Change exactly one value in the rhythm and see where it takes you. Dont string stuff together unless youre going progCohesion has a lot to do with finding an idea then running with it and seeing where it leads and less to do with writing  riffs and trying to stitch them all together afterwards.If you find that awkward then pick two riffs at random and see if you can find a way to get from one to the other in a way that sounds natural  like a word association game or face morph. Think of it as one idea gradually mutating into the other idea.Less is more.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ci5lp1y,1,t5_2qmah

1211144,0,t3_27yv4m,I used to do live PAs with a Yamaha RS and Roland MC with a traditional DJ mixer put in the middle.  The idea had originally come from a performer I saw near Toronto who did an entire live set with two Yamaha QYs with a DJ mixer in between.Much of what I was doing at the time didnt really fit into the realm of making tracks.  I definitely did but my performances were built up around loops and patterns.  I would have variations on the RS and MC that played nice together and Id just go back and forth between the two mixing  channels at the peak of each mix then offloading to one machine or the other when I needed to switchcall another pattern.This setup seemed to work well and it was easy to integrate into the DJ booths that Id often find myself playing out of.  I could even setup one side while the DJ was mixing out of his last record fire up my first pattern and get it going while I setup the other side after the DJ finished.After a decade long break Ive decide to get back into this way of doing things because frankly it was bloody fun.  I picked up a Roland MC and MV a couple of months back and have been building out more traditional tracks that way.  For a live PA style of thing I have a feeling that I may add an MPC or RS to the mix and play those out with the MC.  The sequencer in the RS is just tits out the best hardware sequencer Ive worked with.  The MV is great for more linear style tracking but in terms of loopmashing youd be hard pressed to beat the features of the RS  grid groove midi fx and real time loop remixing arewere some of the most useful features Ive come across in any sequencer hardware or software.The big trick Ive noticed when going back to hardware is committing to it .  Doing it the oldschool way forces you to work some real limitations that the hardware boxes put on you.  This includes number of available FX routing options and finetuned sequencer editing found in software.  Ive been finding that I need to resist the urge to hook up my boxes via AbletonSonar and do sequencing there or add VST instruments.  Its an all the time sort of calling I notice but with some thought always manage to come to the conclusion that there are workarounds in the hardware Im using.  This said what I enjoy about hardware is precisely the limitations that it imposes...  I tried going with a full blown computer and software setup with a myriad of controllers and the like.  The harsh reality I had to accept was that software gave me TOO MANY options...  I spent all my time in setup or installations or routing that it got in the way of my workflow and I never really got anything done.  Most of my gear started collecting dust I wasnt enjoying the process and I eventually sold it and got out of the game.Now that Im back in it I do love hitting up hardware again.  Theres just something about the feel of it the ways in which it forces me to work that is so rewarding to me.  Ive justified the extra steps or time that it takes to do some of the tasks by the simple fact that when I had the resources to use software that would cut down on those things I wasnt getting anything productive done anyway.   I was a producer that wasnt producing.Anyway.  This ended up being way longer than I originally intended.  This to say that my current setup is a Roland MC Roland MV another Roland MV that isnt doing much right now.  I use the computer to do some detailed sample editing and final recordingmastering and thats it.  ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ci5vei2,1,t5_2qmah

1301629,0,t1_cifxaw9,LFOs are low frequency oscillators basically they use the shape of a wave sine saw triangle etc and apply the pattern to the settings of a parameter. So for example I can apply an LFO to the cutoff of a filter and the filter will move in the same pattern as the wave. With a sine wave the parameter moves more gradually than say a saw or a square wave. So to apply this to my previous post randomizing an lfo means that the wave is set to random rather than to any particular wave. Most programs have an option to this. It will give you some interesting results if you use it creatively. Let me know if you have any other questions.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cig1t0c,2,t5_2qmah

Like if youve ever played around with a surround  stereo effect with L R C and Surround being straight center but panned to the back as opposed to forward or center.

1407306,0,t1_cisntqm,as far as amps go start with something that you can carry.  i have a  speaker in a massive cabinet.  it sounds great but i fucking hate carrying that thing around to gigs.  i personally am looking into a fender rumble  and i used to use a peavy before my current gigantic peavy. there are many other noteable companies that make fine bass ampscables speaker cable and instrument cables are different! for both  spend more upfront so you spend less down the road. INSTRUMENT you cant go wrong with mogami and monster has a lifetime guarantee.  SPEAKER live wire seems to be working out for me alright so far and they also have a lifetime guarantee.effects  get a limiter. or a compressor but i prefer a limiter.  you need something that will keep all of the sounds you will be making consistent.  especially if you play slap bass.  If you are looking into distortion i would recommend getting something that splits the audio signal and mixes your original tone with the distorted one.  the boss bass overdrive does this i think it is the ODB or something  its the yellow one.  this is important because when you add overdrive to bass you lose your lows which is what the bass is all about.  when it is mixed clean and distorted you get some lows back.Guitars get something that feels good all along the fret board.  and make sure that you can hear the lows and highs equally as well.  if you buy secondhand take your guitar to a guitar shop or a luthier.  they should be able to tune it up to make it playable. im still trying to save up and get around to that last bit of advice...Also im somewhat new to bass  years so please anyone correct me where i am wrong  i want to learn as well!,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cisoouf,4,t5_2qmah

Right now you have only a vague idea of what kind of people are completing the survey people that make music. You should at least include age.Also q is going to give you a lot of headache processing the results. The formats of the answers are going to be all over the place as its an open question.

1416217,0,t3_2abwio,Any DAW will do the job as long as you put time and effort in learning it. Reading the manual twice from cover to cover and youtubing good tutorials. Same thing with a few selected synths  plugins. You dont want and dont need to have every synthsplugins in existence.I know a lot of electronic music producers and most of them are on Ableton. I dont really know why but the fact that it was created by electronic music producers may be one of the reasons. So they thought the software accordingly which resulted notably with the session view a kind of grid in which you can easily drag and drop audio and midi clips to play around its very handy for electronic music. Of course Ableton Live has the usual arrangement view that every other DAW has.I used to produce on Reason then Logic today I do everything on Ableton Live that I find more practical to use in my workflow and yes I do electronic music.In the end its probably gonna be what do you feel more comfortable working with which GUI is more engaging and better suited to your perception.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,citsuwy,1,t5_2qmah

Even at .kHz you have serious signal quality issues at kHz and up. One cycle at kHz only receives  samples. What should be a smooth arc becomes two steps. Vinyl is recorded in smooth arcs.

1501273,0,t3_2bcsis,Ive submitted two projects to them.  The first one was an independent release but we got in very early ... just before they launched the Pandora platform ... back when Tim W. answered the phone himself.  That one was easy.  The CD was on in a week.My current projectl which is digital distribution only has taken a little more time.  The first submission was softly rejected. I called the old phone number and spoke with a secretary who said they only accepted CDseven dropping the old projects name and how wed worked directly with Tim W. didnt work.   The most recent submission was accepted because Pandora recently started accepting digital submissions but even then they have to be distributed by a legit source quotes because the word distribution is a little fallacious in this senseand legit because screw that word.  Weve been using CDBaby since it was a fledgling company too.  And the advice in the other thread about CDBaby not getting you on Pandora is wrong.  It doesnt matter who your distributor is.  You just have to have a UPC and ISRC so they can track it in retail markets.  If they didnt have these restrictions theyd be inundated with anything and everything.  Theyre still overwhelmed by submissions even with these restrictions.  Ultimately it comes down to someone at Pandora listening to the tracks determining if they are professional recordings ie. well balanced and not painfully compressed like a lot of amateur stuff deciding how they fit in their rotations and then I really think it comes down to a personal decision.  Which kind of sucks.  In other words if youve described your music well enough to get it to the right person at Pandora theyll make a more informed decision.  If you describe your music as Pop but its really Metal then it will go to the wrong person for review and they may or may not forward it to the correct person.  Thats my guess anyway.Keep in mind Pandora is not really a marketing tool.  It started out as the Music Genome Project which was really really cool.  It was more of a if you like this then youll probably like this kind of thing.  Im sure it started out as a grad school project maybe even undergrad. Typical collegeguy idealism.  Now that its a business its gotten kind of ... meh.  Pandora is still pretty good at playing music you may never otherwise have heard  but I actually like Google Play a little better.  It seems to learn more quickly what my tastes are.  I wish Gnoosic was a little better I have found some interesting things there but its not nearly as robust as Pandora or Play.Regarding the politics ... yeah their payout sucks and theyre trying to pay less !.  That doesnt matter much to a guy like me trying to get exposure though.  Its a delicate balance and I really dont know the answer.  It would be nice if we got paid for international plays like the rest of the freaking world but thats a topic for another thread.  Copyright royalties and mechanicals all suck in this country.Sorry for the wall of text.TLDR Submitted two projects.

In the end I know what Im hearing on the radio isnt what I want to do though there are some interesting elements starting to come into play so if you are feeling the same way youre not going to be happy trying to chase mainstream success. My suggestion is this there are a ton of people trying to write pop hits  all those  year old hit makers  the world doesnt need more of that right now. It needs real artists trying to convey something deeply personal unique and new. If you really wanna make a go of it then dont try to copy some formula!

1569674,0,t3_2c7itw,Look up the ebook figuring out melody  its free on the internet. my best way to describe melody is to think of the more functionally artistic side of music. the basic element of music is tension and release. Musical elements rhythm harmonymelodytexturetimbre etc work together or against each other to cause this. It is incredibly helpful to start with a basic vision for the music you want. I typically do this by jotting out a sketch of how a piece may be by drawing a timeline graph. along this graph I will have some lines and shapes that describe what Im imagining. this could be a squiggle that implies a melodic shape or bassline. or some xs that mean some sort of effect and notes that say what instrument doing what . youll end up creating your own musical language here.  it is helpful to be open to your original vision not becoming the end vision. it is even more helpful to assume that what you think your piece will be will be completely different than the finished product.Your outline is going to serve as a guideline because starting with nothing is overwhelming. Along the way most likely youll have a spark or make a mistake on an instrument or a wacky idea youll try and often that will write your entire piece! Be open to this.   I cant recommend enough to learn your favourite music. you dont have the learn the whole tune but anything that REALLY stands out to you.. learn to play it! reverse engineering your favourite music will allow to you understand in pieces that you understand on a personal level. it will become yours and the process of performance will help you see the music in another way. Many writers forget that music is to be performedproduced too. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cjd161n,2,t5_2qmah

Its the same format just involving the lingo of the music biz. Your major concerns are rights to their music and getting heard. Watch out for high Advances. A capital a in advance is actually terms for a loan if u didnt know. If u do know im sorry if I seem like im talking down to u. Not really my intentions. In the nut shell you want as many albums to be secured and as much as an advance as you can get that you think this band will actually recoup. Find ways to make sure the label cant keep the band stuck with them. If you are willing to get a book I can guarantee you that the musicians business and legal guide by mark halloran is a great reference.

1615093,0,t1_cjipt9i,I disagree.Take the highest  strings on a guitar the D G B and E and transpose them up a perfect th G C E and A and you have a ukulele with the exception of the G string being an octave lower. Because the strings are tuned in the same interval as a guitar the fingerings on the ukulele are identical. Again there is the matter of the G string being an octave higher but for playing chords that doesnt matter much at the basic level. Advanced ukulele technique takes advantage of the G and A string being a nd apart but we are just talking about getting started. There are also no rules against restringing it with a thicker G string allowing you to tune it more like a guitar or a baritone ukulele.A mandolin on the other hand is tuned in ths. This makes the chord shapes and scales very different. You dont have your prior knowledge of the guitar to fall back on. Also I would caution against thinking of a mandolin as a guitar tuned upside down. Instead think of it as being tuned in ths. This is much more useful.If you have a guitar it is very easy to practice playing bass and ukulele without buying one. For bass only use the lowest  strings. For ukulele capo at the th fret and only use the highest  strings. Emulating banjo or mandolin on the guitar requires retuning and relearning technique because youll have to learn all of the proper fingerings. Of course this is only my opinion. Hopefully Ive explained myself well enough to help you understand my example.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cjiqzd8,3,t5_2qmah
1621293,0,t1_cjjiig1,But we arent talk about dominant personality typing and being analytical being ONE side of the brain and creativity on the other. They are talking about how the hemispheres collectively are more involved in one or the other but the linking of both is required for it to work. You dont just used one side to be creative. You use both but one side is more  involved because of what process happen where. That doesnt mean the other hemisphere is  completely off just because it isnt firing.  Our hemispheres do process different information. There was an experiment in the s where epileptic patients volunteered to cut the corpus callosum. The one mentioned in your article. The idea was that if the seizure would only hit one hemisphere the person would still be partially functioning to ask for help or pull over a car.What they found was how the brain stores and processes signals in the hemispheres. One patient could identify a pen but didnt know how to use it. Another could write with the pen but I didnt know what it was or what it was for. They found that without the bridging the left and right side of the brain would fight each other. You would see a patient move his left arm but his right arm would swing and intercept it. This is far less about separate hemispheres and exactly about how the hemispheres work in tandem. In your article they talk about how regions of the brain are used more or less as storage units for processes. The video is also describing that but in a little more of a readers digest way.Music is firing signals from everywhere. Where it comes from is important. What isnt firing is equally important. The brain hemispheres have different process but the cooperative effect of both hemispheres is where we get the output.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cjjj2ol,3,t5_2qmah

I believe you are running into trouble with EQ and actual SAMPLE choice. You need to find sounds that are filling in the frequency range that you want and when I hear this song I love everything about it except for the snare and the hi hats. So think about pushing those a little bit deeper into the mix and maybe even replacing them with some sounds that fit the mood a little better and have more of the right frequencies.

1681029,0,t3_2dm4i4,In that video these are condenser mics probably large diaphragm these are goto type to mics to record room sound and Im guessing the one in the middle is omni directional. So if you want to record the sound from the whole room with one or two mics youll need that kind of mic and no need to spend a lot of bucks the cheaper ones are probably good enough. But you better have a good sound to begin with  which is why the guys in the video went through the trouble to do this in a place with a tons of reverb and it only works because theres not a lot a percussion or bass and youll need to find the right spot to put your mic can make a big difference. A zoom h type of recorder could be interesting especially if you intend to record yourselves a lot theyve got builtin condenser mics can work on batteries and can nearly fit in your pocket.If you get serious about this like if you want to release those tracks publicly youd probably be better off closemicking everyone but itll be more expensive youll need more mics stands and cables as well as an audio interface with a enough inputs.

Free or open source plugins are often community created and supported if you think that this alone means an subpar product you need to have a look at the open source community as a whole.  It is entirely possible that an engineer working on a licensed product could have also contributed to a free product.  So no paid engineers little to no advertising opensource licensing community provided support as opposed to a dedicated support staff  free product.   Dont take this to mean that all free plugins are great quality they arent and many times a paid product is better quality but most answers here are saying that the answer is in the sound quality alone and that just isnt necessarily the case. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ck3zd3f,3,t5_2qmah

1813553,0,t1_ck7nmf1,I have a modest but nice home setup for vocals and guitars. Telefunken AK AKG dynamics and a couple of decent preamps TL Audio C modified and a custom preamp. My vocal room is small x but auralex foam gobos and multiple cardiod settings on my main mic helps to keep things as tight as I need them to be. After introducing a few local artists to the sound I have had several come in to record acousticvocal songs at a rate of    per night  to  hours. Everyone is happy. Some return and some have referred others to me. Im in a small market so theres limited potential. In a bigger market however you could have a steady flow month by month. Its no replacement for a professional studio setting but the lower price is great for song demos tracks to play for family just for fun etc... A close friend owns a professional studio in town but hes fine with what I do as I always sell his studio to clients as the next step. In fact he came over and helped me position the mic and foam for best results. I also practiced with my setup in that room for several months before bringing others in.Basically anything you can do well in your studio has a value to other artists who lack the equipmentknowhow but who have similar needs. And theyll appreciate it!  Beat making tracking vocalsMCs  whatever youre set up to do. You do however need to be careful about who you bring into your homestudio.

The two Ive used are also quite buggy and the audio latency renders them virtually unusable.

2103765,0,t3_2j0l2m,Do you want to play live with it? If so you wont need an interface but simply some phantom power supplyAn interface often does have phanton power suplly builtin but always not true but  requires a PC to work. Its its main task Beeing transforming signals from a microphoneinstrument to be readable by a PC and transforming the signals a PC sends to the interface into signals that make the speakers play the sound. Some read on that.Your microphone also has such interface builtin already! As far as I can tell from the amazon page it has two outputs One XLR output which gives an analog signal and the USB connection where the analog signal has already been converted into a digital signal. Also Im pretty sure that when using the USB connection you wont need a phantom power supply. However this is not very handy when performing live.Maybe since you would need to spend some money alread for the phantom power you should think about getting more fitting mic instead. The Blue Yeti Pro is not made for live performances and can cause a lot more problems with feedback than microphones built for live performances do. Also the audio quality might improve. The Shure SM  is the one trusted by thousands on live stages everywhere. If thats too expensive than even the SM  might be a solution.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cl78fs6,5,t5_2qmah

2125314,0,t1_cl8ulzw,well. the recordings are quite good as far as I can hear so you should definitely be able to get a good sound mix out of this. I dont know how much general knowledge you have about mixing so Ill try just to roll out some thoughts you can start with. Instead of turning op the drums as suggested by NotSoNoble Id say you should turn the other parts down a bit so that youll have a more balanced sounding track where you can distinguish between the sounds  like NotSoNoble said. In the end you can turn the volume up using a compressor and a limiter. The overall output of a track that hasnt been mastered should be between  and  dB if you ask me. Keeping a lot of headroom in the mix allows you to make your song more dynamic. After that and again I think the instruments sounds very good already but you will probably want to do some EQing as well. This site can be very helpful for purpose It will give you the knowledge of the frequencies of various instruments and what part of the frequency spectrum you should pay attention depending on what you want to do with the sound of the instrument. Oh and one last thing  When EQing I suggest you dont make any steep cuts in the sounds. if you stick with soft EQ curves and only substracting a few decibels at the time youll end up with the most natural sounding EQ and I think thats where you want to go with this recording. I hope this can help a bit. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cl9z2jy,1,t5_2qmah

Use a mute for a few  bow a little farther up or down the neck for each one bow hard and bright for some soft and mute for others.  Make sure the headphones are not too loud and there is NO noise because that will build up fast.  Play as tight as possible because sloppiness will show up easily.

She couldve signed and left. Or come and gotten us. Or laughed and admitted how over excited she was that she was full of fear about her next  years instead of being in the present moment. Maybe show a little leadership skill. I know how to look at my side of the street.  Do you know how to accept mistakes and live tolerant?  Because without those things you wont be very successful in business.    I went on to run a creative comedy production company. The guitarist became a master general education teacher for gifted jr. high students. We know how to fking show up.  What we DIDNT know how to do is be smart about setting the band up more like a business partnership. But even then people can quit.  And they do all the time. And this singer did it again years later. Ya know all these years and bands later I still really dont know what to say to you. But I have learned one thing  I dont have to say a thing.  I know that I did my best and honored my contract with myself then. And to this day I give people latitude with time and am gentle and kind with mistakes made by others and myself.  What is this life if not a journey of forgiveness?    The lead singer couldve been a household name.  We couldve been a household name. We are not. She is not.  What good did that do the world to which we give the gift of music and inspiration? When we become musicians we become servants healers representatives to the people.

Forget who it was but the quote went something like If the product youre consuming is free for you to use then actually you are the product  What that means in this context is that spotifys customers are actually advertisers and the original works of art on spotify are really just being used as bait to bring in viewerslisteners of ads.  I think this change in the value system is what is undermining everything.  It literally doesnt matter what the content is as long as it brings in ad views.

2413995,0,t3_2n3mv1,There can be but not necessarily different samples for different velocities. Its important for another reason. The important difference is that you can have different velocities for notes that are playing on the same channel at the same time. For example you can play a C with the note velocity really low hit the sustain pedal then play a G really loud. If you tried to do that by just changing the channel volume the sustained C would become really loud too when you turn up the volume to play the loud G.Thats the main reason they are separate.Protip A lot of people dont know they should use the expression control instead of the channel volume to add dynamics to their track. The expression control is the volume relative to the channel volume. This allows you to adjust the overall volume for the channel while keeping all your dynamics.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cma2ucj,2,t5_2qmah

2445751,0,t1_cmdy7f4,You are right but what I was meaning that hiring the professional to operate this stuff is something that is not considered to be the main reason for hiring a studio but in reality it is the most important part. I have mixed tracks for artists who have gone into university studios which have amazing consoles and racks of outboard gear but the resulting recording still sounds really bad because the engineer was a student. The amazing gear and rooms did not help the artist achieve an amazing sound. This is what happens when bands think that great gear and a great room produce great sounding records. In reality it is far from the truth. You could send a great engineer into a less than ideal location and produce a better sound than an amateur in an amazing space. I have seen this time and time again and this is why I mentioned that the reason why people should pay for studios is not because of the gear but because of the experience of the engineer. But yes it is a lot harder to get good sounding recordings in less than ideal situations but I would still take a professional engineer recording in a house over a amateur engineer in a studio any day.

2476432,0,t3_2nwx0x,For myself my music falls into several different genres such as edm  folk  and even classical.I was walking through the dali museum in Berlin and was actually thinking about this  that he had so many different artistic styles. As you walk through the exhibition you can see how each style gets developed. When you get to see his later paintings such as the more famous melting clocks elephants with the really long legs and that stuff you can see bits and pieces of all his earlier styles that have been combined and refined. Yet those who only look at those final famous paintings see it as just one coherent style even though its really just a bunch of different previously developed styles that have been tied together.So what Im saying is that having different genres that you create is natural  good. It means that as you progress bits and pieces of those genres are going to be part of whatever your final style is or I should say your style later on in your creative career.For all the different genres that you create I would suggest making at least one album  story that goes with each. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cmht1p6,1,t5_2qmah

2531930,0,t1_cmp1eqj,Gain staging is a really important part of mixing.  Almost every effect you add to a track can affect the gain in some way compressors are a big culpritthats why most of them have something called Makeup where you adjust the gain to compensate for compression.  Reverb has a wetdry mix for those reason as well.  EQs can alter gainespecially if you boost frequencies.The only way to do it is to go through each track onebyone and examine each component the effects the signal the sends etc. and make sure youre not boosting too much.  You can boost up into distortion without ever touching a fader.Then you get into the whole prefaderpostfader debacle.Sometimes its just easier to remove everything and start over.  Pay attention to your levels on your master fader and start mixing slowly again while paying close attention each time you add an effect.Audio is cumulative meaning you increase the relative loudness with each track so you can have  track of whispers and it will be quiet but  tracks of whispers will add up to a lot on your master fader.Look up gain staging on youtube and youll get lots of hits.Good luck!,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cmp25oy,7,t5_2qmah

2580344,0,t3_2pbgvf,The different midi channels are mostly in case you want to send midi signals to hardware or if you plan on playing a large setup live.For instance I have this old keyboard that has two lead voices midi ch.  backing voices ch. one bass midi ch. and drums midi ch. so I could use my software to send midi signals to the keyboard and have the hardware keyboard play all channels simultainously. I never do that though.Another usage is if a midi controller uses channel  to send the movements of the knobs and faders then another channel could be used to send program changes to change the whole layout of the controller. This is handy if you play a whole set live and need different layouts between songs so you could let the software setup the controller for you very quickly. I guess it depends very much on the controller if it has these programs in the first place.For a more common everyday use you could setup your DAW so different midi channels control different VSTis and use the controller to play different instruments at the same time or just for easy selection. Its not something youd need everyday for composing at home but if you plan on perfoming live it could help you out a lot so you dont have to mess around in the DAW as you play.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cmvdzp9,2,t5_2qmah

My favorite signal chain with the SM is SM gtgt Neve  clone gtgt .Compared to a Condenser the SM does need more gain but you shouldnt have any problem doing vocals with an SM and a i.  A better pre is a nice to have not a need to have in my opinion. Pretty much any of the vintage designs will give you a solid color pre option which can be useful.

If you do youll want to run the LR output of the Tascam interface to the mixer and then hook your speakers up to the mixers output. Or you can forget the speakers and mixer entirely and just listen with headphones via the headphone jack on the front of the tascam while recording.  As far as recording software goes Ive seen several people recommend Reaper. I dont have personal experience with it but its worth looking into since its only . Logic ProTools and Cubase are all great. Just depends on how much you want to spend. You might be able get away with using Audacity which is free.Since you just want to record and then transfer everything to a computer in the other room you could run a long usb to the other computer if it isnt ridiculously far.

Understanding theory in terms of Key Signature and the harmonic possibilities to you over any given chord progression will help you explore possibilities you might otherwise neglect.  Also understanding the connection of the Pentatonic Scale to other scales might help as well.  Mainly Id say study melodies and learn how to play them on guitar.  Great guitar solos are not scales theyre melodies.  The more you study them the more youll see your improvisational chops get out of the pentatonic prison.  This is what jazz musicians do and its why they solo at such a high level.  My first book I wrote is on soloing I mention it because I think it can help you.

2882757,0,t3_2t2z9m, Know why the beatles put hours upon hours into their music? Sure they had the passion for the art but the reason they were able to keep at it was the ability to make money and continue to work hard. Making great music is very difficult and takes thousands of hours to truly hone. Since there isnt a monetary value to good music anymore the powers at be have chosen to flood the airwaves with quick digestible lowest common denominator pop music. Ala syrupy katykesha pop songs created with formulaic contrived melodies engineered to get stuck in your heads. Welcome to the musical wasteland. Every thing is engineered in those songs the lyrics the melodies the vocal cadence vocal styling and melody structure everything is maximized to get teen girls to love and obsess over and give teenage boys wet dreams sound and lyric. Max Martin has mastered this art of catchy melody for teens and its success has reverberated throughout the industry. His protege Dr. Luke has continued with the pop formulas and found some new ways to craft pop hits by combining underground dance music with pop formulas. Theres no doubt a lot of talent from both these producers theyve mastered the craft of the pop hit much to the demise of our ears. They get payed to write number  hits over and over again so that the singers can tour and sell out shows to millions of teens.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cnvrt4z,0,t5_2qmah

2887103,0,t1_cnw91qw,gt Can I boost the lower frequencies of the loop without affecting the other drums and their place in the mix?Boosting the low end of the loop will increase the low end of all of its elements...but this might work out okay. The only way to know is to try it and see how it sits in your mix. gt Can I layer another kick underneath the loop to fill that gap instead?If boosting the low end of the loop doesnt work this probably will. This also gives you the opportunity to create contrast. For example leave this nd kick out for the opening bars then bring it in when your bass synth comes in.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cnw9lrb,1,t5_2qmah

2897393,0,t1_cnxehml,Yeah Amazon freaks me out a little bit. In terms of openness Amazon loses when comparing to Bandcamp.  Plus they take .  Of course distribution is huge but you can only get to kindle owners or kindle app owners unless Amazon opens up and uses .epub or something non proprietary.  My main concern with buying kindle books as a consumer is what happens if Amazon and Google have a big spat and Amazon pulls support of the kindle app from that store? My Nexus  becomes a paperweight.With Bandcamp you can upload your library to Google Play and still have full access to your library on any device for free even without the All Access subscription.

2901336,0,t3_2tbse6,See I thought of a really really useful function for this thing. Of course since its so useful Avid will probably never do it.This applies much more to the post production world than the music world I think but if you could run PT simultaneously alongside PT or  HD and use PT as essentially scratch or design tracks.  Have an option that is essentially Send selection to PTHD and it would freeze your tracks slice them to match the selection and then drop them at the current playhead in PTHD.This would be GAMECHANGING for the post production world  essentially having two playheads theyd need to allow video in PT too that are only loosely linked with an easy way to transfer material from one to the other.  Design your big scary robot in a big scary robot design session and be able to edit it to picture in PTHD or tweak the design onthefly in the design session.But like I said theyll never do it.  So were stuck opening and closing sessions or just making ourselves a library of big scary robot and then hoping we dont have to tweak it again later and reedit all of it.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cnxvyt3,2,t5_2qmah

I have heard of some producers being more in control if you give them an idea. For example if I were to track vocals and messed up a part. Rather than me hearing it and deciding the producer would go sing this part again and keep me in the booth. But thats not at all what this guy was doing. Which is fine but I was expecting different. However he did start to put in more input as he got to know us and could see more of the song.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cok0vf6,3,t5_2qmah

The other thing I have learned is that at some point you have to let go if you want to share.I listen to stuff I have available to the public from a couple years ago and cringe now.

3303707,0,t3_2xz1le,Look its not about following a theory. Its nothing like that. I studied theory all through school and now I have a degree in it but when I write I dont sit down and think OK now Im gonna use x mode and this scale...No. Its not like that. But learning all that stuff introduces you to new ways of thinking new ideas the same way that listening to a whole lot of music does. When youre in a bind it helps you try something new it gives you options colors ideas. Its very easy to say oh well so and so didnt need any theory  but what does that even mean? Some people have a great ear. Some people feel what others take years to learn. So you cant really judge how much theory someone really has all that matters is what comes out of the music.There is no correlation between formal knowledge and the result hell I endured  years of composition school listening to what I consider to be absolute dribble by so called top scholars of composition and theory. You have to decide for yourself what you think is right. I just dont understand why people limit themselves why they dont want to push to learn more and try out new ideas. Theres this mistaken idea of what theory is and how its applied and its just silly. Sure you can say a guy like Paul McCartney didnt read music so what? Doesnt mean he doesnt have an awesome inner voice of what sounds good  thats theory caring about the chords the voicings the progressions  which make no mistake guys like him really really do care about that stuff. If you think they dont know how that music is working on some level you are sadly mistaken. Some people have an awesome sense of chords or melody they just feel whats right and are able to come up with crazy stuff. Others will get to the same point through other means by learning about progressions scales key signatures studying music in different ways. You have to figure that out for yourself but what I will say is it doesnt hurt to learn more. Sit down for  minutes a day and learn a scale or a new progression from a genre you dont work in. I guarantee it will flavor your writing over time.  And no learning to read music does not mean you know much about music theory. There are plenty of Classical Pianists at college who can shred up and down yet wouldnt be able to tell you much about the composition or theory of the pieces or write their own simple pop progression for that matter...or improvise even a basic melody.

Saying all that though at the end of the day...a good track is a good track regardless of the mix quality. I mean did you hear the shoddy as hell mix of Hot Nigga by Bobby Shmurda?!

3728691,0,t3_333l18,I usually start with a short riff or progression on guitar or piano or occasionally bass or drums or synth record it figure out the notes and chords then jam with that until I come up with a cool bassline and accompanying parts. From that initial segment I figure out the general mood and structure I want to aim for and usually switch up instruments or turn to theory until I find an interesting way to continue. This isnt a fast method of working but it gives me very different results each time and writing on different instruments lends itself to different types of songs.I mainly do harmonyfirst writing where the focus is the progression and the layering of different parts and the melody is added later. When I do melodyfirst writing its usually in a classical context but I want to try to apply that type of writing to rock and electronic styles.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cqhanbf,1,t5_2qmah

Its a collaborative process and I appreciate engineers and also want to produce and want to put in the time to make something better. On the other hand if you where going for a different sound like a garage sound and the engineer give you something that really polished song that lacks character I would have a more problem with that.

3768641,0,t1_cqlueii,Sorry to tell you I think you messed up a bit. That power supply is used for live situations and wont help you connect the microphone to your computer. The mic you bought uses XLR cables to connect. So in that case you need to buy a audio interface to be able to connect the microphone to your computer. Those arent extremely cheap. For example this is a decent quality budget audio interface  Most or all audio interfaces I know have built in v phantom power. So you wont need a seperate device for your phantom power.So youve got two options now. . Cancel your order and get a cheap USB mic as an easy fix.. Get the mic you bought and buy an audio interface. Option  is the better if youre planning to take recording your music seriously.Good luck! ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cqluped,1,t5_2qmah

This leaves me with  low powered ports  thanks God my MIDI keyboard works with low powered ports so I plug it into one mouse into the other and the third at this point does not have enough power to power almost anything. So if I would want to plug in another midi controller or hardware synth I am out of luck  I have to use a powered USB hub.Another thing I would pay attention to would be the hard drives.

3856170,0,t3_34l8p6,Theres a few ways you can fix it. Equalisation. Mic noise is most prominent at higher frequencies and you can cut those with equalisation. It can alter the sound you want though so its not the best solution but its the cheapest as pretty much everyone has access to some sort of EQ.Theres noise gating which cuts sounds below a set level of decibels. Can be done in real time usually with hardware or as an after effect. Not sure if FL studio has this built in.Then theres noise reduction where you record a sample of the static then the sound you want and a plugin or piece of software compares the two and removes one from the other. Dont know if FLstudio has anything like that though.Lastly theres buying a new mic. Like Soundsjunkie said the sm is dynamic and therefore not very sensitive. I would say buy a condenser mic but it looks like your interface doesnt have phantom power for it which means you would have to buy either a new interface  mic or a USB condenser.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cqvu7rw,2,t5_2qmah

I explained that I am looking to break into the local scene and would love to buy them a drink so I could get their take on getting involved in the scene.Get ready for a lot of rejections and nonresponses but keep at it someone out there will reply. Also find out who books shows at the venues you like. With some Twitter research its usually not too tough to figure this out. Email them too.All it takes is getting your foot in the door with the right person. From there youll be surprised how welcoming these communities can be. DO NOT take it for granted when you get your first small break. Do everything to help out and become known as someone who puts in the extra effort.

In my case I do a lot of post production mixing from multitrack recordings from live gigs. Usually they are recorded totally flat and little time is given to proper mic placement.

It depends on the setup of the performers as to how and who they want to trigger. There are others but those are the first that come to mind.I dont really use these products myself but my friend is a vocalist with a VE at his feet while he sings and he can do similar things as to what youve mentioned.If you want to see some other vocalist triggered effects in a live setting here are some videos by Kimbra that show her looping sampling and effecting her voice by herself with some of these units mainly the HeliconPlain Gold Ring Nina Simone CoverSettle Downs MusicNo ScrubsTwo Way Street,WeAreTheMusicMakers,crcxj0u,3,t5_2qmah

Sunday Monday Tuesday Thursday and sometimes others happen.  Despite there being a music school in town thats relatively balanced MF ratio wise the males are FAR more likely to be seen making a beautiful mess in front of the audience.  And I think thats what it it actually is  The females dont want to be seen as sucking or being bad in any way.  At least half of the males dont give a crap what you think and another good percentage will even suck on purpose sometimes like me!  Its fun!  The females very very very rarely have that kind of devil may care attitude that Sarah Silverman has.  And although I am a bit of a perfectionist ish in the studio I just let it all go when performing.  That seems to be harder for females.

4037919,0,t1_crgimhx,I am saying that the time when major labels actually invested into artists was a long time ago. They only invest into mechanical rights now and do not actually build up artists.Investing into an artist also means taking risks and pumping money into something that isnt a sure shot but may be worth it in the end because that artist or band is just so outstanding and different that there might be a chance that the resulting product will take off big time.Investing into an artist today with very very very few exceptions means finding a good looking singer with a good voice and having ten songs written by some producer teams and making them write some songs which are catchy but nothing more.Why do you think you are listening to the same four songs everytime you turn on the radio?The vast majority of artists and bands who do not fall into that pattern and who are big and got signed by a major after the s build their career with an independent label or even on their own on the internet and were fairly big before they were signed by a major. Of course there are exceptions like Lady Gaga or Shakira who actually actively write their songs.Majors arent willing to let artists experiment that much anymore. Can you imagine i.e. an unknown Radiohead would send a tape to one of the majors today and get an album deal where they could express themselves musically the way they do?Money is much tighter in the music industry today and its not only the recording on its own that companies have to pay for.

4181503,0,t3_38ob5h,So I have a very odd perspective on this. I play in a band that plays cons and renfairs a large portion of our pay comes from passing the hat and we are competing with other acts for audience members and banter is vital for keeping butts in seats. On the flip side we play   minute sets a day for  weeks at a time so we get to practice our banter and find out what works constantly.. If you are going to talk to the audience open with something they can respond to. The standard is Is everybody having a great time? just dont over do it. The point is to get the audience to make noise as a group because in the natural silence that follows you can talk and they will focus on you. Other examples ltInsert VenueCity Namegt Let me hear you! No you can do better than that! Thats the forced enthusiasm I was looking for. Just dont over do it see rule .. Keep it light even when you are about to play something serious toss a one liner out before you go deep keeps the audience paying attention and the contrast will help.. Keep it short. Brevity is the soul of wit the banter is cleansing the palate between courses it is not the meal itself.. Flatter your audience and pay attention to them. Is there one guy just going crazy ? Point him out in a flattering way Holy crap that guy knows how to party. Thank them for being there for supporting your music and do it sincerely. . Did you say something that responded well? Do it again next show. Pay attention to what works for your voice as a performer and play with it find out when and why it works and then adjust it too your needs. The more you do the better you will get.. Have fun. If something funny happens roll with it. Audiences want a good show but they also love when it suddenly looks like the masks have fallen off and its the real people. It makes them feel like they are connected to you. Also its fun. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,crww875,12,t5_2qmah
4182150,0,t1_crwy834,Ok so recording live drums is kind of out those Yamahas are a great set of monitors.  If you are looking a what gear to buy next I would say an upgrade in the interface an upgrade in mic and possible a good preamp would be it.  Although I would caution you buying more gear will not automatically fix things but it might help.  What you have now is great starting equipment th  should last you forever and the i is a decent interface for the price.    I would say to continue to work with what you have try reading up on mic placement positioning in the room and use of compression eq and fx on your recording.  One thing I have seen many people do wrong with their interfaces is turn the gain up too high.  You want a good level but a quiet recording can be boosted once its digital without adding any artifacts that arent already there.

4207813,0,t1_crzpn3s,I am passionate about what I do.  And I am very aware that my life experience is shading my response to MVGEN.   But I am not commenting on here from the vector of someone who gets paid to make videos and is worried for my job.   And I am very aware that not all songs or artists are able to create a music video through the old ways.  I am also aware that not everyone deserves a video needs a video or even desires a video.  I am commenting from the place or vector of someone that understands more than many on this sub what it takes to help a band find an audience and how their visual representation fits into that equation. I am commenting as someone who has over . billion views on Youtube of projects he has made for artists.   Who has helped artists make  dollar music videos that found them millions of new fans and done videos that had million dollar budgets that didnt help the artist one bit.   I am pointing out that from a business point of view making a video that is a bunch of random images processed and tweaked to the beat of your track is at best forgettable it gives no added value to your work does not engage your audience and does not help build a bridge between you and your fans.    And worse if it includes images owned by others as every video I have seen on MVGEN does it leaves the artist open to copyright infringement claims and lawsuits.  If you think you cant afford to make a music video trust me you cant afford to pay for stealing it. I agree with you that such a video is not going to resonate that well with Miguel fans  but I go further to say that they are not going to resonate with audiences of trap vaporwave or whatever the next movement is doing to be dubbed at least not in a statistically relevant way.  Not in a way that turns onetime viewers into lifetime listeners.  But thanks for trying the Youre to old to understand cause this is the new shit argument.         In my experience what works is creating a human connection an emotional connection between an artist and their audience.  If you want your video to be useful to be worth the effort of having created it you have to engage your audience and take them on a journey with you.   Invite them into a world that is yours share your humanity with them.   MVgen doesnt do that and why I am so negative on it.   What I think MVGEN would be great at is uploading a database of an artists existing media to give fans a way to remix fuck around with and connect with the artist.  That could help bind a fan to an artist.    But I still see it as ineffective in its primary stated purpose.   And by the point you have the media to do that you will be able to create a more effective video already... As an auto remixer the idea becomes more palatable to me and I see some potential for it helping make an impression to build a fan. I am sorry that I am coming across as being a dick and shitting all over your baby.   If I was a better diplomat I might be able to share my thoughts without being so negative.   But alas I am my own worst enemy in this regard. Anyway good luck.   Prove me wrong.  Change the world for the better.

4208516,0,t3_39301a,I started by playing with DJing software to get a hang of rythms and and all that shit and it helped me start to explore more obscure genres. A few weeks ago I started using ableton live and watched a few videos on how to get started. I tried FL before but Im finding FL to be much better. The two best resources Ive found so far have been Tom Cosms introduction to production or whatever he uses ableton and it was quite helpful. izotopes mixing guide was also a HUGE help and make me able to actually somewhat mastermix my tracks compared to what I did at first. The best way to learn is to just play with the program. In terms of learning to play music or get more creative consider trying to listen to as much variety in music as possible. Variety in EDM is great but go even broader for even more ideas. And now I ahve a Midi keyboard waiting for me at a local shop and that seems like the next logical step. There are programs that can work with Midi keyboards and having something physical makes learning the basics of music theory easier and knowing about chord combinations and such is a boon for creativity and composition. Reading music is nice but I thanks to choir I can do that already. Not sure how to learn to do that it took me two years to get to my basic level Im at now. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,crzyj0v,1,t5_2qmah

The portastudios do have built in EQ so that will help you out a bit. As for fuck ups lolIf you fuck up you just rewind and re record.you can also punch in and out for say a guitar solo or if youre doing guitar or bass in sections.

4282919,0,t3_3a07md,I worked as a composers assistant for a guy in LA who wrote for TV movies think Hallmark Lifetime NBC etc and I myself write for various filmTVvideo games. Heres my take on itYou owe it to your clients to give them the best product and listening experience that you can produce. Period. At the same time you need to know your audience. When I was working in the studio we normally mixed in stereo as we would for a DVD release  however because we were making music for TV we checked our mix in mono to make sure that the score didnt sound too flat.You shouldnt be losing tracks when you listen in mono think of how the device that your score is heard on will affect the range of frequencies in your score. If its heard on a phone your score will be mono and the bottom end is probably going to be nonexistent and your high frequencies might be overpowering. If your score is going to be heard in a movie theater your low end might be super boomy and blast everyones ear drums out. On a TV you might still be in mono and your score might sound midrangy and flat. Ultimately youre not going to be able to perfectly predict how your score will sound on any device or venue so just mix it the way its suppose to sound and check the mix on different devices.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cs8ekfh,2,t5_2qmah

4410353,0,t1_csmrezl,No problem.Yes Logic is a DAW and the Alesis would control the instruments you load into it.  These would be virtual instruments synths samplers etc... that receive MIDI data from the Alesis.  So you would create a track and click it to arm it to receive the MIDI data from the keyboard then load a virtual instrument into that track.  If you load a piano virtual instrument when you play the Alesis youll hear piano sounds.  If you remove the piano virtual instrument and replace it with a synth when you play the Alesis youll hear synth sounds.Personally I would recommend getting an audio interface.  Since youre not running external synths you can get a basic one quite cheap.  The benefit of the audio interface is that it removes the load of processing audio from the CPU in your laptop onto the external interface itself.  This Focusrite interface would be a great option Focusrite is a great company and they make quality products.  This PreSonus is another good option.  Im currently running a PreSonus Audiobox  in my setup and havent had any issues with it.I use a PC instead of a Mac so I cant speak very specifically about your setup but on PC the interfaces come with a specific audio driver that is designed for audio processing etc...  These drivers are known as ASIO drivers.  A huge benefit of this is going back to your latency concern.  Less CPU load spent processing audio means more CPU for processing MIDI and that means lower latency.With the audio interface you could bypass the mixer completely and run straight out to your amplifier.  Personally I run my interface out to studio monitors but it has standard  outputs so you can do whatever you want with it.The mixer would come in handy if you were going to run other external instruments to your amplifier.  For example you could run the audio signal from the interface to one channel of the mixer while another instrument could run to another channel then you could run that combined signal out to your amplifier.It sounds to me like youll want to just run the audio interface though and completely bypass the mixer altogether...,WeAreTheMusicMakers,csms5c9,2,t5_2qmah

Its fine that a particular venue might have some regular performers or a house favorite that get to skip a queuelottery...but how is an invitation only open mic any different than a promoter filling a playbill? What you describe is a regularly scheduled albeit informal gig and misses the spirit of an open mic entirely.To my mind an open mic means anybody with the courage to put their asses and their act on the stage can have a fair chance to perform. Whether there is a first come first served queue or a luck of the draw lottery or an informal who wants to play now? vibe there should be some mechanism in place that gives anybody a shot to play.At the very least there should be some form of audition or demo review to get on a list of approved performers but even that is stretching my interpretation of an open mic further than my liking. Im not saying everybody needs to sit through everybody elses crapshow If you get up in front of a hard crowd and you bomb well thats just a chance you have to be willing to take...but the very nature of an open mic means you at least get a fighting chance to bomb that hard. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ct6ccrx,1,t5_2qmah

4666842,0,t1_ctipnn3,I see that you mentioned what vibe you were going for with this but at the same time I do not know why you bothered recording it. This seems like the kind of song written and recorded within a half hour span.  I think the first thing you need to do is really think about what you are trying to achieve with your song. Hey if I play this riff it sounds like Wavves is not really a good enough reason to write a song. Before even talking about the production we need to address the structure of the song.   The overall problem with this songs structure is there is no dynamic. It has that little bridge in the middle but that quickly ends and it just goes back to where it was. You need to be more considerate of your listener when you make a song. Hm they have listened to the same chord for a minute now. Is that going to get boring?. Just make a conscious effort not to be boring.  The vocals are not good but I think that is just a matter of finding the effects you want to use and getting them right you will find that naturally in time if you keep aiming for the same vocal style.On the production of the song it is not pretty. There is a lot of high end here and no low end. Try picking some bass lines on your guitar syncing them up and then pitching them down to fill out some bass in your song. When you are playing your power chords are you barring them? Because it sounds like you are not and only capture the high notes because of it. Try to get more range out of your guitar.  In your DAW put a low pass filter on the song and cut out some of the high. EQ up the lows a little.I think if you focus on making sure your song is not boring you could start to find yourself making some pretty fun songs. Good luck!,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ctit5mk,1,t5_2qmah
4668700,0,t1_cthoce1,I do this for vocal harmonies. I mainly use harmonies in choruses so thats going to be my example. Ill write a melody that works on its own it sounds good. But since its a chorus it never hurts to try adding something new and harmonies can really make the vocals stand outgive your chorus life.So I have my melody that works and I want to add something new. Sometimes Ill play my keyboard sometimes draw the notes in. But look at what the chord is what the bass is playing what youre singing. What notes are you trying to emphasize? What feel are you going for? What intervals convey that? I generally use close harmonies mainly because of my limited vocal range lol but also I like them.

You might also try shifting one side of the track by a hundred samples or so less than a millisecond. Keep track of your attempts and try to listen to the result with your monitors in mono.

Its much better to reduce the buffer size though because doubling the sample rate doubles the CPU usage while changing the buffer size does not change the CPU usage at all.I would recommend always working in .khz when working on music or khz for video.  Exceptions might be you are trying to do something with ultrasonic frequencies that humans cant hear or maybe you are recording something that you want to slow down playback by up to .  If you really feel the need to work with such a high sampling rate at least choose .khz for music and khz for video because those rates are exactly double what you need to export at and the conversion will be much better.tldr dont increase sample rate but do decrease buffer size,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ctx7k68,1,t5_2qmah

4836449,0,t1_cu45vms,If you sample and it is recognizable then it IS just taking. If you take a photograph of a Lion and it is beautiful and someone makes this huge composite photograph with many different elements in it and your lion is in there and looks like your lion then they took something you made with your knowledge of photography with your investments in the gear and your trip to see the lion your days of waiting for that shot or what have you and just took it made something else with it. That something else may be something else altogether it may be very artistic and very beautiful and the artist may deserve a lot of merit for creating it but the fact remains that they took something someone else did and didnt pay for it. There is value in having nice photographs of lions there is a cost to making them and part of the value is that people can use it to make composite images of which the lion is only a small element.Other times though people sample the hook of a song and it is essentially ripped off. A lot of times that happens in hip hop. But granted sometimes its not so bad it is more subtle and more credit for the quality of the song is due to the producer and the sample is just an element of that. But the people that recorded the sample originally with that know how and with that equipment and all that also need to be protected. There is the song as a written work and there is the recording as a work of a recording or production. If you sample a sound because you like the sound well someone made that sound like that. It was by design. Work went into that. It didnt exist before. If you sample it you are using something someone else created as intended. Of course again you may manipulate it beyond recognition and thats fine.  ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cu468ak,1,t5_2qmah

They are moving exactly together but the bass is slightly ahead and the ride cymbal comes down right in the center of the beat.  It creates an amazing forward moving groove.You can do the same in your bass lines.  Align them just slightly ahead of the drums and you will feel the time propelled forward in a unique way.

You saidgtEvery time its to your advantage to not be involved in the process of pissing off the people who have helped you out.But that statement doesnt make sense in this context. The venue approached them with an offer to make  more money. In this case its CLEARLY to their advantage to engage in the kind of thing likely to piss off Booker A. Booker A is likely to be pissed off to be cut out of the deal. However doing the deal nets you  more money. Its more advantageous to have  more money. So its literally more advantageous to potentially piss off Booker A which is the exact opposite of what you are saying. Note Im not saying you should be a dick about it. Respect Booker As position if you run into him explain the deal was too good to pass on. But dont feel obligated to call him just so his ego doesnt get bruised by your band trying to make more money. The fact is if youre in need of venues then Booker A is an invaluable asset but if the venues he usually books with are approaching you directly you dont gain anything out of helping Booker A out. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cuwe76v,1,t5_2qmah

5175015,0,t1_cv9lhek,Im just saying that there is a precedent slowly rolling out here for the future of crowdfunding. Dude what exactly would you have done  years ago? Youd eat this loss and probably very hard get a shitty job and work your way back. and youve admitted you werent paying to cover your gear. A lot of people with your kind of gear do this but because you were irresponsible now society has to step in. And I use the term HAS because your campaign is going to relate to people touch people and make them give you money. So now in the future a band can be irresponsible in the safe knowledge that they can crowdfund their way back. Im sure you swallowed your pride and hey everyone makes mistakes but my point here is the precedent being set. It doesnt matter if it wasnt your idea anyone can say that. It wasnt our idea now were all clear. It wasnt your idea to get stuff stolen it wasnt your idea to fully insure your expensive gear. It wasnt my idea is an excuse. Theres going to be hundreds maybe thousands of musicians alone now falling back on crowdsourcing and Im asking everyone here is that right? Even if its their first time mistake even if they had to swallow their pride thats still thousands probably more in times to come. People are ignoring what led up to this event and just jumping on me for pointing out there are ethical flaws here. and there ARE flaws. I wish you the best of luck dude but every crowdfunding venture born of irresponsibility and mere life setbacks is pushing this crowdfunding revolution into questionable waters. Again its nothing personal to you its just that Im starting to see trends forming. Id want my stuff back to. But I grew up without crowdsourcing. I see it as something I should use to fund ideas projects those already in need of relief. Id never crowdfund my keyboard and DAW if they were stolen. Its not fair my stuff was stolen but I also dont see that as justification for putting that online and saying I need this DAW and keyboard to live so heres what I lost now everyone give me money. If everyone thought like that well this is where the slope begins to form. Anyways Im done.

If you like me enjoy sitting at your desk and trying this EQ or that EQ massaging your channels with just the right amount of compression and just the right compressor rewriting the automation until its just right etc then GO FOR IT! Hell yeah thats awesome! But if its daunting and difficult? Why waste your precious creative energy doing something that is stressful? Itll take away from your art.I work with plenty of musician who dont know jack about audio even when it comes to their own gear and theyre perfectly capable of conveying their needs to me. A lot of musicians downfall in studio is thinking they can do their engineers job better than the engineer. Leave us alone to do our art and you may be surprised what new light we shine on yours. All those hours musicians spend practicing their instruments I spend placing microphones trying different preamps deciding whether parallel compression is needed or fader automation or I should just smash it or leave it alone. Most of what makes my job difficult is the musician not doing their job by coming in under practiced without kickass arrangements. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cvdzjtn,2,t5_2qmah

5428387,0,t3_3pdn0x,You want to become a better musician in as little time as possible there is a simple solution PRACTICE. Practice at least  hours a day every day. If you really love playing music then  hours is nothing. Ive given that exact advice to a bunch of people and the two that really took it to heart are relatively successful DJs who have toured the world. Another who didnt try as hard as them but still upped his practice hours managed to sign an EP to a small Indie dance label. You are also going to need resources so quiting your job before you had another one is pointless...get a job at a music shopinstrument shoppawn store...Or any where else musicians congregate and network because after building your skills up you are going to need to know people.Also your electric isnt ruined. Make a list of all the parts you need to piece it back together. Remember they build these things from scraps of wood. If there are no salvageable parts go on eBay and spend the  dollars on a Luthier kit guitar and  bucks on a Luthier tool kit and build a new one. AND WRITE THE PRICE OF IT ALL OFF both mentally and for tax reasons as the price for your education to become a guitar tech. So the first thing you should do right now is PRACTICE. The next thing you should do is work on your resume because tomorrow you are going to find a new job at a place where your local musicians are. If you have to scrub toilets scrub toilets but while you are scrubbing toilets dont forget to NETWORK.If this all seems too difficult for you to do...then give up. When I was  I had already moved out and started to make a dent on my local scene. By the sounds of it you have a lot of growing up to do...and you are just now grasping how difficult it is to chase your dreams. There is no shame in giving up if you realize you arent willing to pay the price required to reach your dreams but you will never regret paying the price and seeing where that path takes you even if you dont make it rich.

I.e. if its the tonic I vs the fifth triad V or even an unexpected major third it sounds totally different in context even though its exactly the same chord because it implies different things about the melody and direction of the song.But yeah also it can be inversions of the same chords or even straight up different chords in some cases see responses below,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cw62tzo,2,t5_2qmah

5454745,0,t3_3pq2g5,Whose band is it?Yeah I know its everybodys  but from a legal standpoint thats a nightmare so its best to sort this stuff out now while you like each other. Whoevers running the band needs to register an LLC. Band Name LLC is fine.Now all the musicians in the band are independent contractors for Band Name LLC. Band Name LLC receives money in exchange for services and goods and spends money on marketing merchandise needed equipment trailers lights stage monitors whatever probably transportation and paying the independent contractors.The CEO can decide how much the LLC retains and how much gets paid to the band members  thats all based on how much youre making and how much youre spending. I used to make out a budget  itll be X for stuff well need were making Y from upcoming shows so youre getting paid Y  X  NumberofBandMembers this month. Id advise against splitting equipment purchases though. Either have the band member buy equipment out of their own funds which would mean the item is owned by them and can go with them if they leave or have the LLC buy it in which case its owned by the corporation and stays with the LLC. If you want to pay out a bonus to a band member thats eyeing a new purchase thats one thing but shared ownership is generally going to be a problem if someone leaves moreso if they get fired. Usually I covered the PA equipment and emergency replacement equipment Guitarists amp blew up? Buy a  solid state for him to play on tonight from the LLCs money and then if someone wanted to use something better that they owned instead would either hang on to the LLCs stuff as a backup or liquidate it and put it back in the LLCs coffers.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cw8w904,3,t5_2qmah

Hell yeah it does but in that case youre creating a reinterpretation of the original anyways try to add a different perspective to the situation the original song presented.

You can easily achieve this by having a compressor trigger and bring the volume down on everything that is running through it every time another track usually kick drum hits. Youll need a compressor that allows for sidechaining or key input. Some hip hop artists do a really cool effect with this where they mute the original kick sound so that you only hear the compressor pushing the volume down of other things with no obvious input.

What type of attack a sound has is determined by the sounds attack time or how long it takes for the volume of the sound to go from silence to maximum level. It is critical to consider the attack time of sounds when applying processing. Compression gating and other types of processors can destroy a sounds attack changing the character and quality of the audio. Reverbs can also be affected by attack time careful use of a verbs predelay parameter will allow you to optimize the reverb for different types of attacks.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cwwok65,1,t5_2qmah

I like to layer a few different pad sounds usually one hard left one center and one hard right. You can get some really nice spread. Maybe cut out a little low end from the side channel pads so it doesnt interfere with the center one. In terms of lead synths recording two slightly different takes with slightly different patches and splitting them RL can make some really good effects too.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cx2282l,1,t5_2qmah

Everyone.  They made sure that this movie would be perfect for all ages and the intent going in was to make the most money possible.Inception which I did not call the greatest movie of all time but simply a great movie to draw a contrast to Star Wars  a mediocre movie seems like a movie that a person thought of and it was their dream no pun intended.  They loved the idea and so did the studio.  So it was made with no dumb kid humor no appealing just to make it a wider audience for more money.The main thing is that a movie like Inception starts in the imagination of a writer like the original Star Wars while Star Wars  and Avengers starts in a Disney studio meeting room to discuss how they can maximize profits.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cyeeetk,0,t5_2qmah

Weve ditched a c for a Manley vocal reference and smb with the capsules aligned with drastically different eqs. Also Ive done two mics on hip hop sessions where theres a piece of shit booth though Ive totally cheated and used a little labs to align the phase just so we get some sort of proximityambience effect.  Personally I prefer to sum them either in the console or pro tools and then do my main compression and eqing but many people dont. As a side  If youre looking for the doubled vocal effect I prefer to do them after weve compd tuned and timed the main. We then get the singer to match it as closely as possible so we can move on and edit them during a session when theyre not there. Also I have to say that the Antares harmony engine and choir plugins are just awesome at faking it.

There were maybe  factories in the world that made cassette deck motors and both were in China. No matter what brand or product line you bought the motor would go plotz. Same thing on my  head Sony with  motor transport. So I gave the Fostex to a friend and got a Marantz PMD . King of  tracks. When the motor died on that one I coughed up the money to fix it. Its still running today. I got a Tascam  Mk III from goodwill for like  or . Without power supply? But of course. Try finding one of those. Probably have to get my wife to make one.

Sunshine itself is fairly generic and its using the easiest pop progression in the book to give you feels.

I mean the actual electric guitar sound has got more to do with an effects chain and distortion as opposed to the actual guitar itself.You could probably do it in and out through a pedalboard if thats what you wanted but you might get good results and find it much easier if you tried something like Guitar Rig or Amplitube.

It responds well to a quality preamp aswell what interface are you using?When I was starting I thought I needed an condenser microphone as well but just know that the NTA is very unforgiving microphone and you will need a treated room and a quality preamp as it needs phantom power to drive. In my experience it is harder to make a vokal sit in a mix if you use an condenser the smsmb will take a lot of eq and will cut through you mixes.In summary the NTA will require a treated room a good interface with a clean preamp is very bright and will require effort when you mix the vokals.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,czr2aav,1,t5_2qmah

6531263,0,t1_czuqqkw,Im piggybacking off of what this guy said. Its harsh but its the pretty much the truth. My story is this I worked my ass off to get into a very good music school and I spent  years working my ass off to get my music degree. And immediately after I graduated and got into the field I went back and got a second bachelors in a different field after seeing what it was like and this comes from someone residing  minutes outside of NYC. Ive had plenty of work in the industry arranging music for a ballet company in NYC teaching writing music for videogames in NYC LA Sweden Latvia the list goes on but its very rarely on a steady consistent basis. A plan of action that I tell younger people to do these days is to enhance your backup plan and dont plan on your music making you any money until you have had years and years and years of establishment. Have an interest in computers? Get into that field first. Use your college education as a means to make a career not to learn a passion that honestly you can teach yourself. Ill admit the school that I went to was great and I learned from some very talented and notable people. But the most that Ive gotten out of that is namedropping and cool stories to tell my friends while drinking. If you really want those connections mind you that professors often tend to pick favorites and if you arent an aggressive attentionseeker then youll have an even harder time becoming one of these favorites then go to the practice rooms of the school and hang out and practice. My school didnt have electronic locks so anyone could come in and practice and it wasnt a problem. Then if you want to take it further you can enter the school as a nonmatriculated student and take some basic music courses here and there and make connections that way. Dont forget to frequent the bars in the area too to meet musicians there. Specially after performances!I work now in an unrelated field. I make a comfortable enough living to be able to buy all the music crap I could ever want I have flexible hours and I still make plenty of money on the side doing music. Its not nearly the  that I need every month as a minimum for rentbillsstudent loans and for that reason I cant quit my day job and only do music. What I have been doing though is working less hours at my day job and putting more hours into my incomemusic. There will be a day when I can switch to be a full time musician but Im going to be patient and wait for it. Getting out of music school with k in student loans is hard enough with any job let alone teaching lessons and performing gigs as your only income which is hardly enough to live off of let alone to pay off debt. I dont regret getting a degree in music but if I could make the decision right now in my life I would have gotten that degree in something else.Edit I dont mean to get you down but heres some realities that youre going to have to look at You said dont want to teach. Teaching is one of the best only? ways for musicians to supplement their income that might actually be a consistent paycheck. Its fine if you dont want to because honestly its probably the worst time right now to get into any of the artseducation fields. You mention audioengineering which is great! But the problem with that is that the common trend is to record your music in your bedroom these days due to things like the invention of the iPad Waves Pro Tools and portable mics actually not sounding terrible. So that means that most studios arent getting tons of business which means there are fewer studios fewer positions more cutthroat hiring processes. IF you can get a gig as an unpaidhardly paid intern at a big name studio you will have to make coffeefood runs for  months before they even let you touch any of the knobsset up any mics. So thats going to be rough. Studio musician? You better be damn good you better live in LANYC or you better have the connection of a lifetime. Its rough man! There are plenty of people who do it and make it work but to me the music field as a whole has always felt like a lottery field. In order to get in somewhere and making a real nice living outside of teaching which a lot of people do and it works great for them you kind of have to win the lottery with luck or win the lottery with a connection.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,czuvudq,3,t5_2qmah

6564713,0,t3_45jgqb,The huge mixing console is so you can have multiple inputs where as your audio interface may only have . This is an analog studio and generally they have the full band play at once rather than multitracking. All the knobs are EQssplit into separate bands Q and gain signal routing and gain. Read up on mixers and youll learn a lot about them they all work relatively the same.You are correct. The big racks in the back are outboard gear. EQs compressors limiters reverbs delay etc. Think of your VSTs on your DAW but hardware not software. Because this is an analog studio they have to run the micsinstruments through the effects before it gets recorded.Theres a snakelong cable with multiple male XLR inputs on one end and multiple female XLR on the other or something equivalent built in the studio and goes to the control room and plugged into the back of the mixer. Think of the mixer as a large more complicated audio interface.As I stated before its an analog studio they dont use a DAW like you would in a homedigital studio. Its all recorded to tape which then gets splicedcut and taped back together for editing.Hopefully answered most of your questions.

6724595,0,t3_47p75q,There are two main categories of throatrelated potables. Healing and disinfection is one and the other is performance. I see both kinds of potions suggested here. I like the salts and vinegar gargle for fighting infections. Nothing better really. I would avoid sugary beverages in conjunction with that. For maintenance and performance I use  teaspoon creatine  teaspoons honey and a dash of salt in drinkably hot water. The intention is to keep the voice box hydrated so I gargle it in addition to drinking since that is the best way to try and coat the voice box without choking.I do not think dairy is the devil but everyones chemistry is different. I once read that singers from before the age of amplification would drink straight cream before performing. Oil will trap moisture in the tissue that much is certain. I have also seen a picture of a famous singer drinking honey before her gig honey is a wellknown humectant. Now I must preach for a second. Immense stress tends to cause physical problems that can overcome any preparation. That said if your throat is sore it is likely that you are not rehearsing enough or that you are rehearsing in an abdominallylazy fashion. My throat used to get sore all the time from bad habits while talking. I rehearse for  minutes  days a week now and as long as I keep up with practice my throat is nighinvincible. If I miss too many days of rehearsal bad habits tend to return and a sore throat results. In my case rehearsing with good form reduces the occurrence of throat maladies. Good luck with your voice.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d0evqwc,6,t5_2qmah

Good is subjective so you gotta have in mind what good means to youFor example if you just pan all your instruments to the center its gonna sound like a mess.

6946853,0,t3_4av2s4,There are a few things at play. Ive been producing music myself and have just started to get to a point where I can objectively be really confident in my mixes and their ability to sound big. The things Ive learned Ill lay out quickly for you. Your sound starts with your composition. A good composition can be made to sound really poor thin or muddy. It can also be made to sound really good! A bad composition is pretty much going to be unattractive whether its mixed to a high professional level or not. With pop music the goal is to have something people want to listen to. Of course this is a no brainer. Something else is to consider is quite literally the frequency ranges of the instruments you are using. You dont want to many instruments taking up the same frequency space.. This leads to the importance of EQ. Its often recommended by high and low pass filters go along way to help shape your sound by removing really unneeded frequencies. For a bass instrument low pass most of your high frequencies away. This helps open up the mix because even a small amount of noise in these frequencies can bleed into your overall sound causing a muddy sound. . Compressing some elements can make them pop. . Reverb can help create a sense of space. Doing this in addition to panning your tracks effectively help open up the mix even more. . Find unique characteristics in your music that you want to emphasize as a part of your production. This is pretty vague but for myself it goes hand in hand with the other  elements. Ive discovered that for my own music it starts to sound larger once I add multiple vocal takes changing reverb on each creating space EQing each differently and panning I quite like one core vocal take down the middle and two harmonies to the right and left. Its not a perfect process. You have to experiment to get to a point where it will be really good but hopefully this helps you some. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d13r8um,6,t5_2qmah

Its your job to get a good balance as opposed to a lot of volume. If you have a track and its already at  or even close to it then it probably doesnt need to be sent to ozone just for more volume. If youre going to do it anyway no more than .dB reduction might be a good number but attackreleasethreshold will play into how it sounds a lot more.

7228731,0,t3_4egf2m,If I had to guess Id say because modern DAWs are heavily computer based and computers and tech have traditionally been a boys club. Its messed up but thats just how its been.And if you go preDAWs Id say doing live gigs and such are also a boys club. I remember reading an article from a few musicians who are women who said that as they would bring their gear into a venue they would often be accused of being a groupie or a girlfriend to the real act.Hell I can even see music shops being a boys club in a lot of regards. Especially when it comes to guitar which tends to take on a competitive edge to it in addition to the artistic side.And then theres just the general sexism that exists throughout all of society that doesnt help much.Its all fucked up and should change. And I think it will slowly change now that more kids are born into a world where easily accessible computers are the norm. And hell every Mac comes with a built in DAW too.

7242928,0,t1_d21gcoo,Depends on the studio but generally prolevel studios start around hr and go much higher than that. Keep in mind that its common practice to do different parts of the recording at different studios. Often times drums are the first thing an artist will invest money in for an outside studio since it requires space sound proofing acoustic treatment and lots of mics and inputs. Then the bands take that back home and build on top of that at their home studios. If you have more money you can do more at the studio and less at home. Its quite common to do the vocal recording at a much smaller studio partly because of cost and also because of vibe and comfort. Many artists will record somewhere very casual like their home a cottage etc. I would suggest at the very least that you commit to the idea of trying out  pro studios in your town for  or  hours each. You should tour at least  different studios to get a feel for the people youd be working with. Be sure to contact them well in advance to have a quick meeting to go over what exactly you want to achieve from the sessions. gtHow much is someone looking at for lets say  songs?If youre hiring an outside professional for everything in other words youre not doing any DIY then song is a pretty normal pro studio level starting point for an indie artist for an allin package for something that would be worthy of standing toetotoe with just about any other thing out there. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d21gvc6,1,t5_2qmah

Otherwise its not worth the investment as the preamps in your Tascam are good enough for demoquality homestudio sound.If youre looking for an inexpensive preamp the GA Pre is a good bet as its a neve clone and around .In terms of mics I think the best bang for the buck is the shure SMB.  Not the best detail because its a dynamic mic.  But MAN that mic sounds great  especially with that preamp.This is a great alternative for a condenser mic if you want a little more detail.Make sure you have proper acoustics as well.Easiest way to do this is hang a comforter around you in a U shape around the mic.Without the proper acoustics it doesnt matter what micpreamp you use.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d25n059,1,t5_2qmah

They are completely different designs and one can not be used as the other nor is that something you would want because they are built completely differently. All the mics you have mentioned so far are dynamic mics. Phantom power is required for condenser mics to work at all and will not cause any damage to dynamic mics. Condensers are more sensitive to quieter sounds and more accurate at picking up high frequencies.As a complete aside I am not a fan of the SH at all.

Good to see youre making use of social media they are your most important tools in this day and age and you should make sure you keep them up to date and keep them linked on your various profiles.As for reaching audiences you dont already have  just networking with other artists can be brilliant. If youre on SoundCloud find people similar to you follow like comment share. But remember to be genuine if youre just trying to sell your own music on someone elses it wont work. This applies to other websites and networks too but SoundCloud can be incredibly useful for building yourself up when starting independent.

7514921,1,t3_4i9add,I just started making beats but Ive been in a punk band for years called Dikembe. We have released some records through labels. Working with smaller labels was awesome because we were fortunate enough to have good PR to back us up. Here is my advice for anyone in this type of situation STAY UP. BE OUT HERE.What I mean is dont ever get stuck on your laurels.Just because some old white dudes like your record it doesnt mean they understand it. As long as you stay away from whack AF contracts you can be your own best advocate. Nobody cares about your shit as much as you no matter what the fuck anyone says. So push your shit. Dont be obnoxious to non fans with like  invites to your halfassed FB page but once you have a base FEED THEM. Give them your best. They get you.With that in mind we started our own collective to release records under Death Protector Collective. We took out a loan interviewed PR people to make sure they give a shit and made a record. I intend to carry this mindset into beat making as well.I didnt link anything because if you give a shit you will find it.  ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d2weqj1,3,t5_2qmah

7770770,0,t3_4lqsiz,Im gonna leave alone question  amp  because I dont have the energy to answer them and they arent really my area of expertise. But heres some detailed advice for your second question.Ive been DJing for years using a laptop and controllers. Are you using Ableton for live performance? If not I would recommend it  its as far as I know the best program to do live mixing.Heres a couple tips for performance. Get controllers. Map the controls to FX racks in Ableton. Make your own FX racks to make it interesting and personal. It can help to download other FX racks go through them to learn what they did and get ideas on what you want to do. Heres a cheap controller for starters. . Do lots of live mixing and remixing. Dont just play from one of your songs to the next. Take parts of songs and mix them in with others where it sounds good. Take a vocal track and put in another songs breakdown and then do wonky stuff to it with your controllers. This is all stuff you can do in Ableton which if you dont have it yet you will learn how to do when you get it. This way youre creating a new product for your audience and actually performing for them. A lot of people hate on DJs because some DJs just press and play instead of getting actively involved in their set to create something unique and new for the audience. If you want someone to look to for inspiration on how to execute an  interesting DJ set look to Tipper I have no idea if hell fit your taste or not  but he writes all his own music he remixes it all live on stage  so you never hear any of the  original songs on his album but you do hear sexy mashups and remixes youve never heard before. On top of this he scratches on two tables. If youre not looking to learn to scratch just be as active on the controllers and the live remixing. Also  I like to make a few subtle FX on my rack so I can be active on them without flooding the music with FX.. Be enthusiastic on stage. This can be a matter of taste. Depending on the type of show I find a DJ who is really stoic to be kind of funny some times. But I like to jam out a little while Im playing. I stay focused on the controllers and computer but I play music that makes me want to dance so I bounce around a little while Im playing. It doesnt hurt to pop on the mic and engage with the audience every once in awhile as well.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d3ph2u0,13,t5_2qmah

The tempo was almost identical. They were even layered keys amp drums in a similar fashion and the game was related to one I was playing  hours a week and made highlight videos for...and made my own soundtracks. I didnt want to step on Copyright feet right? But this track was taking from me!!!Well I contacted the software company and they actually put me in touch with the sound guy who crafted the track. CCd legal most of the time I think. I tore into the dude and his response was Man Ive never seen your vids or heard your tunes before you came up and started being all aggressive and after a couple more back and forth emails I knew he was right. He was telling the truth.I went and got up in some dudes grill some guy just trying to make a living playing by the rules and accused him of something he didnt do.Call this an airing of the grievances if you will but half the time I think my best wisdom comes from fucking up and making mistakes that didnt kill me.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d3x54zy,8,t5_2qmah

7843260,0,t3_4mp248,I would suggest you hold off on acquiring instruments for now. Its easy to get distracted by cool sounds and learning how some pedal works and you FEEL like your progressing somewhere but you havent learned anything.  There are some good books on lyric writing by pat Patterson not perfect but good. For theory I would start with learning how chord progressions work. Write simply as you can. Fancy chords dont instantly make a song good. A limited well placed fancy chord CAN emphasize a special emotional moment though but if overused no moment is special. Do harmonic analysis of songs you like. Find out what makes them work.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d3xng7x,2,t5_2qmah

7871134,0,t1_d40rmft,I think when you put it in terms of genre like that it does get fairly soft but I dont think we need to. Personally I would argue that playing any instrument proficiently can have a pretty hard definition that has nothing to do with genre. If you have achieved an overall high level of technical ability and can move freely within the established concepts of western tonal music majorminor scales standard harmonic progressions then you have the ability to go on and specialize in whatever genre happens to be your thing thus making you proficient on that instrument. Generally speaking a lot of  chord punk guitarists havent achieved any real level of proficiency on their main instrument let alone anything else same goes for a lot of popular musicians in most popular genres.  before you respond yeah yeah i know there are probably some punk guitarists who are absolutely stellar but my point still stands. So I know someone is going to argue well does that mean a punk guitarists who only knows  chords isnt an instrumentalist at all? I would argue yes. You can still be a great musician and not much of an instrumentalist.tldr genre proficiency and instrumental proficiency are two completely different things. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d40sdeo,2,t5_2qmah

Take Apple Corps the umbrella corporation owned by the Beatles to hold Apple Records and Apple Inc. the cell phone giant that still occasionally makes computers and such. They existed in relative peace until the tech company tried to enter the music market with MIDI software and then iTunes. The USPTO looks at claims holistically  Buzz Playing Cards will probably be able to coexist with Buzz Soda two products I just came up with on the spot.However if theres any one piece of advice that any of us on the internet can give you its to GET AN IP LAWYER. If your mark is worth anything to you then its worth it to protect it. Some may do a consultation for freecheap so its worth it to ask around.

If the article had said Apple is pushing against YT to promote its streaming service nobody would ever be surprised. Reznor is using his own reputation to achieve that goal because hes an Apple employee and generally a very smart person. I think YTs reaction sums it up...

You can use the appropriate scales or patterns if you want or you can just go by ear.  Copy a melody that you like but change a few of the notes chords rhythms etc. until its unrecognizable.  Listen to your backing trackschord progressions over and over until a good melody that fits comes into your head. All of these have worked for me at one time or another.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d4n6yno,3,t5_2qmah

8124852,0,t1_d4t9wjz,First of all let me correct your misconceptions economics and market forces exist regardless of capitalism. As for why I say art is dependent on market forcesIts only really in posthuntergatherer society in which the prerequisites for being an artist exist i.e surpluses of food free time to develop art and the ability to exchange goods for things of equal value. In early societies there wasnt the time to develop things like art or music in a continuous sense. Sure in times of plenty where the animals were overpopulated or the land wasnt overexploited but it is nothing like the continuous enterprise and development that makes up art as we know it today. Art has been reliant on market forces in one form or another since the early days of civilization whether its capitalism or even a barter society. Artists need free time to develop anything that we would even recognize as art today they need food they need shelter. Only once theyve fulfilled their basic needs can they begin to develop anything that resembles the modern concept of Art.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d4tb1dt,1,t5_2qmah

Weve got a distorted idea of how music is a road to riches amp fame by growing up witnessing a historical anomoly where for a brief period in history one could get rich selling recordings alone because the mediums were proprietary and not reproducible by average people. If you wanted to hear music you had to buy it or listen to the radio. The Beatles were able to stop touring because they existed in this sweet spot in history and made a fortune. The cassette tape was the beginning of the end of this era. Rap and Pop have managed to thrive because they know how to market and diversify. For the rest of us who play music for the art and dont know how to market we get to go back to the familiar place weve occupied throughout history. Starving artist. Its romantic its fun and it makes us feel a little bit alive. Thats why we do it. If you cant do it for the love of it and you also cant market yourself quit.

AMDs current lineup kinda sucks hopefully their new architecture will change that. Intel is better for music production because each core is stronger than a comparable processing core from AMDs line. Prebuilt PCs are generally pretty terrible due to them throwing in one or two big name things then neglecting the rest. There are  gaming PCs with a  processor and  GPU. Its just one more company in the middle that wants to take your money.What you would want to get for music production is an i or i. If it has a K on the end it means that it is unlocked and you can overclock it effectively getting more performance for free.

Whenever he did shows at local bars just him and his guitar he would just pop out his .inch binder of pop songs past and present then go to town. Something I noticed is that he would interact with the audience a lot and learn what they liked. He would k ow the regulars at the bars he played so he could play songs for them which they loved and it helped the energy. If ever another musician showed up he would hand them a mic or a guitar and jam or play a cover tune that they knew with them. I would show up and play with him sometimes. The drunken audiences really dug having an eighteen year old kid show up smelling like Mongolian food in his work clothes pick up a guitar and play some shit.

As a band you may have to experience way worse than the worst you share with your audience to make your performance as good as it can be.Also having any support maybe isnt the default for many musicians the struggle is definitely a theme and I consider you fortunate to have a supportive hometown network. If you are still into music even with an uncaring or obnoxious audience and want to share something then I say keep going because your music doesnt require even  approval to be worthwhile especially live.But new musicians can be boring or even painful when put up against those with decades of music experience.

Its kind of like asking are kleenex and tissues the same or different?  Well Kleenex is a type of Tissue so all Kleenex are Tissues but not all Tissues are Kleenex.In the same fashion other than VST the other main plugin types are AU  AudioUnit Apples Proprietary format. It is a part of the Mac OSX operating system and only works on Mac RTAS  Real Time Audio Suite Pro Tools Proprietary format Mac or PC but only Pro Tools DAWSo since the other two formats are proprietary formats VST is a bit more of a standardized plugin type that can work with just about all DAWs.  Since VST is used vastly more often than the other types people often will say VST to mean any type of plugin including AU or RTAS in the same way that if someone asks for a Kleenex they probably just want a tissue.Also when it comes to VSTs there are some different things here tooVST VST and VST are all different versions of VSTs.  Most people are still using VST for a lot of stuff and a lot of manufacturers are only releasing VST versions very recently or not yet.VSTi  is a Software Virtual Instrument instead of just an effects or time based plugin.Explanation ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d5qapfj,1,t5_2qmah

It takes airtight construction decoupling from structure and mass to keep sound within or out of your room.This means that if you want to stop sound from getting out you cant just treat a wall.

A LOT of people in both genres start with some source material from some VST synth of their choice drop it into Kontakt and run with it.

Throw in some side chaining and youll be the next flying lotus lol jk. But seriously i think this is a solid attempt man.

8636245,0,t3_4y2c5a,Yup! Its fine to use the headphone jack for recording. The only reason you should not use the headphone jack is if you experience any of the following. Your output is too low and you have to turn your keyboard up to its highest volume setting to get a decent signal. This really shouldnt be a problem . There is any hiss or mysterious distortion occurring in your recordings. The two Aux plugs on the back of your keyboard give two advanced advantages Meaning theyre nice to have but not required for piano recordings. They are optimized for low hiss signals.  They are called a balanced output when both plugs are used sending a good signal to both the left and right cables for a L and R stereo signal. TLDR  go ahead use your headphone jacks. If something seems wrong switch to AUX. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d6l4znp,1,t5_2qmah

They always say that a musicians best weapon is the one hes best at. Basically as cool as Nexus and the others like Serum and Massive are not knowing how to use them to their fullest potential by starting out may not be the best idea. Im not saying you could get other plugins at the start but the best way to learn how to master FL Studio is do practice with a smaller selection of plugins instead of just downloading a crap ton of samples and loops. I had this problem at first so thats my proof haha I usually only use about  plugins that I am really good at Sylenth Play EastWest Orchestral Stuff and Synth Enjoy learning FL Studio Im almost  years deep into it and it is easily the best DAW Ive used!Again dont take this as a Dont get more plugins post but take it as more of a limit yourself to get good at the stuff you have instead of piling more stuff on post. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d6n31xj,7,t5_2qmah

I know youre talking about the audience but its also a reason why I find playing live so difficult finding a band finding material to play. Writing in group is really painful so the advice is that their should be a main writer that bring songs to the band for them to play.Oh boy does that ever work. You get people with  enthusiasmknowledge who either cant distinguish a chord from an arpeggio or either simply doesnt care both sounds good I dont know I dont care play what you want.

8807856,0,t3_50o9sv,I dont really recommend getting those reflection shields or the Eyeball. Theyre not really worth the money like you said and can sometimes make your recording sound worse. The cheapest way to get a dry vocal sound is use the corner blanket method . Just hang up a pair of thick blankets on each wall in the corner. The singer stands in the corner facing away from the corner while the mic is pointed towards the corner. This method takes advantage of a microphones cardioid pickup pattern. The microphone wont really pickup any sounds coming from behind it unless its a very loud sound. The blankets should absorb most of the reflection coming back at you. The closer you position the mic and the singer to the corner the more dry the sound becomes. Hope  this helps.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d76l1r2,1,t5_2qmah

The hollow bass drums dont sound that good to me with the chorus maybe you could replace them with cymbals or a high hat. Also at  if youre going to have  different melodies I think you should try to make them cleaner. Currently it blends too much for my taste but you could instead have them go from a clean sound to what you have in your chorus. Lastly the transition at  is a bit awkward instead of sliding into the top note maybe you could start there just for that measure for the sake of a bigger impact.

People dont care about spending a little for convince. Even with that said music isnt the product and hasnt really been for a very long time. Its used to get attention and appreciation and then they will spend money on things you offer such as shows shirts special releases or merchandise. People going out of their way to rip stuff arent sales but are potentially spreading the word and shouldnt be shut down or feared..I dont like streaming services because theyre open to abuse. Artists can be buried or put on constant rotation. Released tracks can be manipulated and that system is closed to anyone but record labels and those willing to pay just like radio has been. The end result IMHO is that good music is hard to find on those streaming services they regurgitate top  tracks that while good are not brave or new.

8966831,0,t1_d7po1y0,gt Still trying to figure out how exactly harmonic distortion is much different from harmonization youd do for classical composition to get more fullness in your music. Since it seems like theyre vaguely similar only one is originally caused by interference in recording hardware.All sounds are just sums of sine waves. A sine wave is a pure tone.When you sing or play a note on a real instrument you get the fundamental frequency plus all the harmonics.If you were to distort that note new harmonics are introduced and the balance of existing harmonics is altered.If you layer another harmony on a different instrument playing two notes at the same time you have two whole different series of harmonics one from each instrument. Depending on the interval they may not share any harmonics at all. Especially if you are tuned to a nonpythagorean tuning.The best way to learn about it is by unfortunately just learning all the maths.

9009669,0,t3_53o174,I wrote a few pieces of music using a strum stick back around ish.  Its like a  string guitar with frets only where the major key notes are.  I usually either used it with guitar effects to sound lofi and gritty or to get that brokenoveralls rednecky vibe.I use some Casio Digital Guitars from time to time too a DG and DG.  These were an s attempt at bringing Guitar synthesis to the masses.  They are basically a plastic guitar shaped like some wacko spaceage weirdness with a built in drum machine and guts from a Casio keyboard in it.  They have six nylon strings sof the same gauge and make different notes using a membrane pad underneath the rubber fingerboard while the strings trigger the notes from some wacky spring assembly where the bridge would be.  Ive played them through my live rig before nothing like playing a DG through a stack with a good noise gate to get that computer racket out of the way.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d7utl30,5,t5_2qmah

9099597,0,t3_54wppm,I have the Apollo twin duo but for Mac. I had a focusrite forte before that and I instantly noticed a difference not only in the preamp but in the converters on output.

9103552,0,t1_d85xx50,of course not and its rare that I do but thats not my point. my point is that these things should be criticized because they are bad objectively. they affect the rest of the music community and culture as a whole. the lower the quality of music the less long lasting interesting there will be for music in general. people will have weaker emotional ties to the music they listen to and less curiosity about finding new music. plus the simpler the music the more conditioned you become to listening to only simple music and thus unwilling to even explore something with more depth. the more the current era of mediocrity lasts the more people will think that is what the best has to offer. that affects up and coming taste makers and curation who will have less and less of a clue what music came before and what music could be in the future. furthermore its a disincentive to even get involved in music if your society values it less and less. theres less reason to strive to make the absolute best and instead why not spend your time cultivating your image more or more drama or better yet just focus on a different career. I can even stretch this to an unfortunate lack of music education from an early age which only feeds back into a lack of appreciation for music that is a little more sophisticated. plus music education is something that helps develop the brains of young people. music requires your entire brain to get involved from the physical to the mathematical to the emotional.musicians are a dying breed. musical instruments arent being sold as much. people dont care as much about music and top  is apart of that problem because its the de facto standard of what gets pushed to the average individual. and its not just the music itself its the culture surrounding music that its promoting. its vapid its insipid its destructive to the art because it is pure marketing under the guise of artistic pursuit. if the only thing on TV were soap operas then i dont think youd see such an enthusiastic market for TV like we have today.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d863n1c,1,t5_2qmah

9106148,0,t3_54wehm,I make different kinds of music.Some of my musics are minimalist ambient pieces that are explicitly designed for relaxation before sleep or whilst meditating. I have absolutely no desire or need to share these though I sometimes get asked.Other musics I make come in various forms including collaborations. Whilst I dont object to sharing and often do I have absolutely nil interest in fame public attention or broad appeal  Im happy if only those close to me hear them. Thats largely because I believe in music as a communal transcendental or ecstatic experience with more relevance between connected people. From my POV the pinnacle of musical expression are local forms and african tribal drumming among the purest distillations  which is of course a communal locally focused experience and not necessarily technically advanced by western metrics but I would argue its music essence is profound. Other examples might be Mewati Gharana Hindustani music Pandit Jasraj is a proponent of plenty of examples of performance on YouTube. Though Jasraj is now well travelled and performs in various locations its traditionally a localised form of music and simply transcends commercialisation.Commercial music is driven by perverse incentives and for all its cultural relevance it lacks common integrative purpose. In my opinion!Likewise whist I listen to a lot of commercial music I have a keener ear for things that my friends and colleagues have produced. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d86evgm,1,t5_2qmah

9297827,0,t3_57r1gd,Snare fills are a devil to program realistically. You want to be using round robin samples and using ghost notes in your fills. One trick i use is to assign pitch to hit velocity. The membrane of a snare vibrates at a higher pitch the harder its hit. Around a tone for  velocities good for my ear. Similarly try layering a little tamborine to only come through on hardest hits. A rimshot can work ok too.Human ear is really accustomed to miniscule changes around that frequency range. Not an easy job to fool it so any variance you can add to stop brains recognising signs of computers the better.Edit snare rolls i am very wary of unless artificiality is the objective.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d8uke8m,2,t5_2qmah
9309005,0,t3_57yhbo,Recording environment is very important. I lent a friend a condenser and preamp to do some voiceovers for a video he was making. He did them in  takes... one with some blankets amp quilts up for a little bit of sound treatment and  other takes with no sound treatment in different places. Each take was very very different.There are a few things you can do to cheaply treat a room for vocal recording starting with hanging blankets and quilts up to start taking control of room reverb.But other details are hugely important mic placement in the room play with that  move around the room make test recordings in different positions compare them treatment of the room where you stand relative to the mic how you position the mic on the stand if you move it a little higher and angle it down towards the chest you can sometimes get a richer sound because youre micing the singers chest...Start with blankets quilts soft furnishings mic placement... and work onwards from there.One thing to bear in mind as you start googling theres a distinction between sound treatment to cut down on room reverb and resonance and soundPROOFing to stop sound getting in and out of your room.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d8vzfve,2,t5_2qmah

I had to drop the levels to work with it some then brought them back up a bit for the master  bus.What I did was try to clean it up and fit the various parts into the spectrum better. I had to use some parallel compression on the drums but there wasnt much to do there other than clean up the mud and get a better balance to make a little room for the brass.Also tried to integrate the instruments in such a way as to pull the groove back out front so you should hear better bass balance and separation for the two rhythm guitar parts.

9406996,0,t3_59gorq,My recommendation is to buy an interface like this oneAnd an inexpensive but trustable pair of small diaphragm condensers like this oneIt goes a bit above your budget also keeping in mind youll need cables stands and a pop killer but should be the best solution for you to record your guitar and vocals simultaneously. And take it from a recording engineer specialized in acoustic music good small diaphragm condensers are a lot more versatile than large diaphragm ones. However acoustic music mainly calls for well sounding instruments and good room acoustics. But for the start the stuff above should be enough and if you decide to upgrade your gear at some point you will still have a general purpose stereo set you can take everywhere.

9435930,0,t1_d9bxbhu,The video is pretty technical but I think it helps to understand the tools youre using if you want to use them. Compressors are relatively simple though so even just finding a sample of someone playing guitar applying a compressor yourself and messing with the parameters might be more helpful or a simpler Youtube video. Essentially a compressor just dynamically manages the volume of a sound so you can manage how loud the attack of the guitar sound is or manage the volume of the sustain or any combination of both.An example that springs to mind for me personally for a guitar part that has obvious audible compression would be the guitar solo in Another Brick in the Wall pt  Its a cleaner guitar sound than the one you posted but the guitar has a clickiness or bite to it right when the strings are plucked and also has loud and clear sustain. Thats the compressor at work.I was at work so I couldnt listen to your song but I just listened to it now and I didnt notice much audible compression if youre talking about the distorted rhythm guitar in the chorus. The majority of recorded music eventually gets compressed to some degree so Im sure its there but not much more than usual. Probably just a bit to smooth out the sound and manage the dynamics to keep the guitar part at a consistent volume.The uniqueness of that guitar sound to me sounds more like the way it was EQd and mixed it sounds bassier and more midrangy compared to many rhythm guitar parts that Ive heard almost more similar to how rhythm guitars in metal are mixed. It could be a quality of the particular distortionfuzzoverdrive pedal the guitarist was using as well that gives it that unique character too.You asked a lot of questions but just as far as the when to use compression one goes the simple answer is any time you want something to automate volume. Like I said a compressor can smooth out an instrument on your track lowering the volume on the peaks and raising the volume of the quieter parts. Like the video explains it can also help with perceived volume as in making instruments sound louder without actually having them take up space in the mix by using the volume fader. And if you want to use sidechaining of course.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d9c2j5d,2,t5_2qmah

9453764,0,t3_5a67ii,Dont worry about how big they are. Not sure about other DAWs but in Pro Tools you can zoom in and out of the waveform height. I do this constantly and quickly loose track of the actual size. The point of the wave forms isnt really to judge the quality of the sound but to help you visualize what youre hearing and help navigate the song The only thing you really need to be concerned about is headroom. That means that when you are mixing a song and you have all the tracks playing at once you should not be clipping in the master bus or final output. To be safe I use a trim plugin to make sure the loudest elements in my mix kick snare etc peak between  and  dBfs. This way I can balance everything else in the mix around those elements and still have plenty of headroom on the mix bus. I usually use the trim plugins or clip gain to get a rough balance with all the faders at . As long as youre working at a bit depth of  or more its fine to be working at low levels like this. tldr  Look at the meters not the waveforms. Give yourself headroom. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,d9eby8i,5,t5_2qmah

The thing that needs to change in this song is your snare. I hate it it is so dry literal and uniform. I can hear the time and care that went into your piano arrangement but you need to think about drums in the same way. The drum pattern never changes which I think is a mistake but doesnt detract from the song too much. But the snare needs some love in this. Put some reverb crunch it up a little bit EQ out the high end reverse the snare once or twice in the song make it trip up a little. If you put  hours into the piano section of this put  hours in the drums.I dont mean to detract from the quality of the song at all it is a beautiful piece and I am glad to have listened to it I just hope that you fix up the drums and post this again.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,da1w280,1,t5_2qmah

9721742,0,t3_5eb6ky,I have quite a few orchestral libraries Vienna Spitfire Audio Hollywood Brass amp Miroslav Vitou for older samplers.   At the end of the day nothing beats real instruments. I find that when I do projects if I can hire  players to overdub my samples most people can never hear the difference.  players no one can tell.  I have even taken the business approach that it is cheeper for me to map things out with Vienna Instruments and not work to hard at the articulations and then hire remote Brass and String players to overdub.  At the end of the day I spend much less time noodling with a computer time is money and I opted to not spent the K on the expanded orchestral cube and additional libraries that I have wanted.

9731297,0,t1_dacd545,Ya this is also true except for most jobs the expected average is decent paying and the ceiling in an unexpected sort of potential goal. Some jobs dont even have that much of a ceiling either really unless you kind of grow into something else. For example if youre an airplane pilot you would have an expected average income and a relatively low ceiling as compared to like an actor but you could also go into owning your own pilot school or airline or something and grow from there. The perception with being a musician is that there are very few high paying jobs most are very low paying and there is very little medium ground. Its tough because there are many aspects to being a musician that basically anybody can do and that a lot of people can do reasonably well with relatively little training. There is some middle ground as well which is reasonable training and networking that will get you a gig. Like the late night show. Those guys are real pros but they are not Joe Pass or what have you. They are not truly top tier but they are high end professional musicians that know their shit can work quickly and get the job done well. But to get to a really exceptional level is a lot of work. A lot of people can put all that time and effort in and you might not make it which will mean you are left with having put a LOT of effort into a skill set that isnt really marketable. Its kind of a high gamble game. But I think youre right also. There are lots of jobs in and around the musical field which are working musician jobs and the public perception that either you are a top  hit or completely poor is just false. There is music everywhere. The top  names are really just responsible for a small portion of the music people hear. They are often just the vocals of hit songs and people hear a lot more than vocals of hit songs in their daily intake of music. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,daclf4y,3,t5_2qmah

9771817,0,t3_5f4i6w,Heres  things to try. Make the drums louder in the mix You seem to be referencing heavily mastered work while mixing. Many times the premastered mixes have the drums peeking through quite a bit more with the transients getting flattened during the mastering phase.. Make sure theres space in the arrangement for drums and that the drums arent constantly trying to talk over other instruments. Youd be surprised how easy good arrangements are to mix.. Reduce low mids and boost high mids. You want the drums to cut through especially the snare. Boosting the k  k range may make things sound harsh in solo but it will help them cut through that sort of dense mix. Reducing the low mids will help make sure the drums dont muddy up the low end from the guitars. Again itll sound weedy in solo but wont be obvious in the mix. If you really listen to your reference tracks youd be surprised how tinny drums can sound in these sorts of mixes.. Make space for the drums by cutting parts of the frequency spectrum from other instruments. Masking is a very real problem for drums in these sorts of mixes. Make sure nothing else is competing with the drums in the same part of the spectrum.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dahlcn6,11,t5_2qmah
9772292,0,t3_5f4i6w,You should focus more on the EQ so the drums feel more separated. There are a bunch of low frequencies that sound muddy so Id just sweep a notch filter and see what you hear. Particularly on the kick drum. Sounds okay but remember the old adage a mix should start with kick and snare and once those are locked in the rest becomes so much better fitting. Id really highly suggest starting from scratch and sitting with just the kick and snare AND EQ those no compression or whatnot. In terms of specific EQ maybe add some attack to the kick?,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dahngig,0,t5_2qmah

9910064,0,t1_daza7fh,Hi there It is definitely not bad for the first ever song youve written  I remember my own and it was NOT pretty. I think structurally and harmonically its nice too. The guitar is pleasing to listen to.Perhaps modulating to another key at some point could add variety to the music?As for the vocals I would look into really trying to make them intune before anything else. The main reason you probably think its bad is because you are creating ever so slight dissonances which creates a very cringe type of clash to the listener. I would also suggest looking at harmonic writing to spice up your vocals a little  so instead of moving almost exclusively in octaves add in some of the ths that you were doing on the guitar a few ths for a strong bold harmony and some ths and rds and youll be like Mariah Carey in no time!Finally I am no expert in this at all by any means but I think learning the basics of mixing would go a long way to making your piece more aesthetically pleasing.TLDR You have a decent skeleton structure I like the guitar writing look into more complex harmonies and basic mixing and keep the vocals varied and intune and youll improve leaps and bounds!Hope this helps ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dazaz37,1,t5_2qmah

Leave your comfort zone and find something unknown that you can make your own. Ive spent hours listening to the same four chords adding on extra notes or changing settings in my synths and samples. Once youve got the sound you like build the track based around it or even make another experimental element. Knowledge on your DAW or your plugins or your instruments can only take you so far.

10101445,0,t3_5khtoz,I havent used David Copes software but Ive dabbled a bit in writing some of my own stuff. I.e. a small algorithmic drum machine that uses singleorder markov chains to develop variance  winds up functioning kind of like probabilistic entropy given how I have it wired up. It has its sweet spots where itll develop really interesting patterns I can snapshot and save for later.I have actually read a few of Copes books and theyre quite good although a little one dimensional in so far as hes been pursuing the same avenue of algorithmic composition for...  years? at this point. After the first book I also just started getting frustrated by the lack of stuff like code examples. While he understandably want to keep a relatively tight grip on the core of what hes been developing over the decades I found it a little stifling. Its common practice in academic artificial intelligence to actually share all of your work and I think the fact it isnt common practice in algorithmic music composition i.e. Iamuss code is proprietary as well afaik is a massive really fundamental barrier the field will need to overcome if it wants to move forward. Side note I did develop a research proposal for pursuing the application of latent semantic analysis in music although it was rejected in favour of a less ambitious but more reliable proposal. I still think its a great area to look into since LSA is a relatively simple way to capture and analyze multidimensional data.More in the spirit of your question I havnt found markovbased systems like the ones Cope has developed to be really inspiring given that theyre basically to be really reductionist fancy remix machines. A lot of my interest recently has been in the application of neural networks to music given that theyre capable of more complicated and novel output. Actually programming them yourself is a little hit and miss  the setup required to run them is more technically complicated but theres a much broader scope of existing work you can pull code examples from while learning. It ultimately feels like a more useful avenue to pursue for me since you can tailor the math to your purposes more effectively. I feel like Ive been a bit of a party pooper but hopefully some of that stuffs interesting to someone.   ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dbo8c6j,18,t5_2qmah

10109591,0,t3_5kmb38,I work for a record label and we run press campaigns for new artists on a regular basis. Whether or not you are a new artist doesnt matter. We get press for debut EPs all the time. The only thing that matters is that the music is good or at least that it resonates with the writer which usually means good. This sounds harsh but if your music isnt getting press or sales its because people either dont know about it or they dont like it. So if you were to tell everyone and still nothing they probably just dont like it. Try changing something else in that case like the music maybe. I say this because I see so many artists whos music is bad but they just will not accept no for an answer and theyll send press for decades trying to get people to finally accept it and like it when itll never happen. Dont do this. Youll just wind up making people mad and exiling yourself from the industry. I am in no way saying anything about you or your music because Ive never heard your music just in general. Throw some stuff out there see what the reaction is and go from there.A couple of tips. Keep your press email brief but dense with information. Too long or too light with info and its gonna go in the trash. Its not really about time it takes to read its more of a first impressions thing. If you send a long email more than  short paragraphs its kinda like starting the email with Hey I know youre not busy so can you do me a favor?. Have a story about you andor your music. People fucking love music that has a good story behind it especially journalists. If your life is boring and you dont have a good story createmanufacture one. Most of that shit is made upembellished anyway.. Make an electronic press kit and host it online as a webpage. Make the music youre sending available for streaming private link if you want. Lots of places and people including myself have a No Download policy. If you send me music as .mp tracks or something and expect me to dl the tracks to listen to them its going straight to the trash and Im not gonna listen to any of it. Thats both a company and personal policy. It both helps protect against malware and also  of the stuff I get Im not interested in and I dont want it hanging around on my computer.. Remember that the key to press is all in making relationships. When you go to send for press for your nd and rd albums and youre sending to all the same places and journalists youll see what I mean. Its really nice to next time just be like Hey Ken I released another album. Check it out and see if you wanna feature it! . Identify your best places that you think youre most likely to get a feature in or just really want to get on and send at least those ones by hand with personalized emails andor snail mail press packages. Writersbloggers recieve SO MANY automated and mass emailed submissions that its a huge breath of fresh air when an actual human being comes along and treats you like a human being also. Plus when you mass send using whatever website or service youre sending a similar email to all the places that all the other bands sent to. Its so hard to stand out doing that. In general I actually find I get better results sending less emails of better quality than mass sending some generalized email that has no personalized qualities to it at all. Writers and labels know when its been mass emailed and we also notice when it hasnt been. We like to pretend for a second even though deep down we probably know its not true that maybe you actually sent to us because you like what we are doing and want to be a part of it. People on the other side of press emails like to hear good things about what they are doing too. Everybody does.EDIT Oh and to actually answer your question dont worry too much about building hype before releasing your Debut EP. The reason it seems weird and counterintuitive to you is because its just shitty advice. It may be possible to build some hype for your soontobe released first album locally in your town or maybe sometimes even semiregionally but national hype for a brand new artist with no name recognition is just simply impossible. Only the major labels or individually wealthy people can do it because theyll spend like k on MAJOR advertising with the goal being to get that artists name amp branding simultaneously featured EVERYWHERE everywhere you look and that takes lots of money and money is the only way to do it. Its virtually impossible for a new artist with no name recognition to build hype on any kind of big scale so just dont worry about it.  or  years ago maybe but nowadays hell no. Everyone has a band nowadays and just telling people that youre starting a band anymore will get you eye rolls. How the hell are you gonna convince people that youre the next big thing when they both havent yet heard your music and also there have been  more garage bands start up that week just in your town alone. Think about it this way most of your favorite bands you probably discovered them by the nd or rd album and then had to go back and listen to their older stuff. Just think of your first album as your floor to stand on. VERY FEW people get a ladder on the first try. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dbpagn2,26,t5_2qmah

This is so you can monitor yourself without having to deal with the delay caused by listening to your performance after it reaches your DAW.Once you have recorded your audio turn this knob fully to the right to check your recording...but while recording your performance turn it towards the left... is fine.Im just going to give you a list to rule out everything...mic cable. Assuming you are using an XLR mic cable the only way phantom power will work If there is a problem with this cable it might introduce noise to your recording.Not knowing how old your interface is means you also dont know the last time any of the inputs were cleaned...get some compressed air and give them a quick squirt.Go through Presonus list of possible issues If none of these resolve your issue then I would find a technically minded friend to give it a look or purchase an new interface.

Not using the volume faders is a silly and inefficient way to work.

My only concern is that you dont get left hanging in this deal. and when you can negotiate your contract before entering a deal like this it can end up giving people even more incentive to work with you seriously.

With an amp sim you have more flexibility but youre missing the feel of playing through a real amp and often times you have to do quite a bit just to get it to sound realistic.

10356186,0,t3_5oazww,My theory is rough and largely selftaught. But if the key is minor then a major IV chord can be seen as belonging to the melodic minor variant of the key. Typically you play the melodic minor when ascending and the natural minor when descending. So the major IV chord can be seen as  belonging to an ascending progression and the minor IV chord as belonging to a descending progression. So the major IV chord tells us to look up and the minor IV tells us to look down.  ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dchxmue,2,t5_2qmah

Im saying they should do it themselves because its more flexible and you can do whatever you want with it instead of asking someone else to do it. And no thats illegal.

It should be the final few   bringing the track up to a relative commercial and broadcast standard. Sure there are some pretty good mastering guys out there who can turn a track around but more often than not theyre fixing things that would be much better to solve at the production or mixing stages. If you have a solid mix you should be able to get pretty close to a good master with some fairly simple EQ compression and limiting to bring stuff together at the end.Obviously if you dont have access to the mixes and you can only master thats another ball game and the pointers in the previous comments are a pretty good start.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dcppe4i,9,t5_2qmah

10539380,0,t3_5qsr3r,Yup for orchestral stuff you will definitely need to look for third party options. The Logic stuff will not get you there. The ones you mentioned are really great. If you cant afford them I would highly recommend looking into Composer Cloud  a month and you get access to every thing that East West makes.Having said that Logics built in library is pretty amazing. Dont let the stock reputation fool you. Some of the Apple loops have been used in worldwide hits Umbrella Love In This Club. The ES is on pretty much of all of Lady Gagas  The Fame. That silly electric piano called EVB in Logic  now the Vintage Electric Piano? You might have heard it in Charlie Clousers soundtracks.

10539569,0,t1_dd2rstc,recording hotter is not the issue just record at bits leave plenty of headroom say dB or even more and gain it up after recording. Its better not to risk clipping. The point is we are not talking about recording stuff here where headroom actually makes sense he is talking about exporting a finished mix for mastering. All the peaks are predictable there so he doesnt need to leave any safety margin. Just gain it up to dB or so and then even a bit export is no issue. But in the end yes you are also correct because even when recording stuff you wouldnt need dB safety margin thats a little excessive hehe.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dd2rzhd,1,t5_2qmah

10706612,0,t1_ddjwb8j,Normalize  on setting on the export dialog is killing you.Since the stereo out is clipping Logic is bringing down the volume to non clipping values and your whole song is brought down.What you need yo do is add adaptative limiter plugin as the last in the stereo out.This will prevent the master from going over zeroclipping and then turn off normalize in the export dialog.Ideally you would need to mix with proper gain staging and bring down the whole mix so the master does not clip but putting the limiter in will get you through for the moment.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ddkb2lb,1,t5_2qmah

10894441,0,t3_5vkn2y,I compose and arrange music for a psychedelic jazz octet. When I sit down on a new score I think about what kind of mood Im going for what Id like the listener to feel. From there I choose a mode or chordscale I want to be my home base. I find myself usually choosing Dorian and Lydian which to me sound the most psychedelic. I prefer to use the term Pythagorean. Like to think Pythagoras the pioneer of our musical understanding wasnt taking mushrooms is crazy. If you want to understand this better check out George Russells Lydian Chromatic Concept or Adam Neelys YouTube video on scale neutrality. Dorian is the most neutral scale because it contains an ascending intervallic formula that is identical to its descending formula. I like to utilize these modes and bring out the intervalsharmony that is indicative of these modes. Like voicing the  in the Lydian chord or the  in the Dorian chord same dif. I believe this gives my music a psychedelic sound.The other thing is more texture and less compositional. The technologies that emerged during the heyday of psychedelia in America were modulation effects synths delay and instruments like the fender Rhodes and the clavinet. When you throw a wah or a phaser on a clavinet or when you throw tremolo chorus or delay on a fender Rhodes youre getting an unbelievably unique sound dropping with character. It sounds psychedelic and sounds even better on psychedelic drugs. I have lots of experience with all of these things happening simultaneously in sound laboratory. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,de3on6r,4,t5_2qmah

You can buy it bundled with a shock mount pop filter and mic cable By saying you live in a cave I assume it echoes a bit there. For fighting that record in the room as centered as possible and maybe get a reflection filter itll help fight room reflections For this setup a straight mic stand like this might be the best pic All that should total to around  and it should be a pretty complete package for recording vocals at home.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,de4gdkf,3,t5_2qmah

10959972,0,t3_5wi6bf,Here is copy paste reply i made to someone else looking for advice on how to apply to festivals. It may not be what you want to hear but our singers old band toured Warp Tour played Download Festival had a Grammy nomination etc. So this is kind of what Ive picked up having been in a band with him the last couple years.A festival bill isnt filled by people submitting online. Either your manager or person in your band responsible for making connections in the industry would have a one on one conversation about the possibility of your act playing the festival. This will usually be in the form of showing current and relevant releases  tours  singles on air that the band are currently campaigning and reasoning as to why the act will sell more tickets to the festival.Who this conversation is with is usually the festival organiser or dedicated music organiser it happens months before the festival happens.I want to stress two points You need to have a conversation with them not submit a form. At the very least a direct email to the person in hopes they will read it but usually having a social connection to them helps. Thats one reason why managers are important its equally about who they know as it is what they know. Do not try and sell them on how good you think the band is you need to sell them on what your band is currently doing and why people will come and watch you. At the very least you need to have a single out thats gathering or has gathered attention.  point if in your email pitch or conversation you include your plan for the year leading up to and passed the festival.The person who organises the festivals are very very rarely advertised but if you look hard enough youll find them.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,deafz7n,2,t5_2qmah

I agree that bringing out the low end would make it sound fuller and better. Also more morphing modulating and changing elements over time would work well with this kind of track. It needs to be louder though!

10980810,0,t3_5wp0mm,First of all  practice verses that you like. Deliver them as well as you can to figure out how to use your voice like a rapper. When it comes to writing think of your voice as a hi hat  this is a great way to figure out what syllables to start stressing. Maybe most of the verse is closed hat  when does it need to open? How much time does the beat give you for a line? Can you make it fit by changing the rhythm? Write lines that fit the snare rhythm you design. If you have a couplet that you like you dont always have to write the whole thing at once  save dope parts and make them fit later if you have to.Make sure enough of it rhymes  dont be afraid to use near or almost rhymes  its a great way to change up the sound.Punchlines are the most audible component of your verse. Make sure that they are good.Have fun and god bless  rapping is super fun and when you find your voice you will never stop. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,decn25x,2,t5_2qmah

11026108,0,t1_dehrgsx,Thanks for the advice. D I guess that even if Im not looking for a niche genre to fill in I still kinda lack a distinct style or voice or maybe I do have one but I cant properly identify it and I dont know howwhere to look. Ill still be looking its just tricky to find a starting point I do like the idea of making music because usually when I listen to new things I want to make some kind of improved version of it or make my own take on its style but it kinda feels like a pointless waste of time by default and having someone finally show up and say its nice makes it feel all worth it and I definitely dont think this is exclusive to making music.I see where youre coming from though. Ive been trying to improve my social skills for a while longer than Ive been making music actually but either it ends up like a really embarrassing and humiliating failure or a person acts like Ive killed their dog or something failure and my will to keep trying is always zigzagging.

11054604,0,t1_dekym5n,Firstly Id like to state that I fully respect your opinion and I understand that you are not givig me shit.Lets take what you said and furher it Artist A contacts Mixer B who is offering one free mix. Artist A recieves his free mix and really likes the sound of it. Artist A releases his mix and gets a couple of views and feedback. Generally the feedback is positivehe then contacts Mixer B and wants another mix.Now I hope you wont mind but Ill use you as an example of sorts. You are now Mixer B. I am Artist A. I contact saying I do not have  and generaly speaking I got around  views on my video I just started would you be kind enough to give me another mix? What would you do? How do you respond?The music industry is a wide playing field. You can only offer so many free things correct? Now what if Artist A is getting k views a track? Well this changes the perspective. In return for a promotion Mixer B could very well mixmaster more than one track for free.Its a two way street so to say. I wouldnt know how to respond to your questionin the right circumstances both Artist A and Mixer B would profit but then again in some scenarios they very well could be wasting their time so to say. Its a tough question and Ive put thought into it and see where you are coming from and honestly I could not give you a concrete answer.

Where you plan it out like planning and writing a piece of text before reading it out.If youre writing music as you go along then you will more likely be bound to where the music wants to be and arguably have less control  unless you are fluent in music theory and can craft it on the fly.Im not saying your approach isnt valid. I am certain many great songs were written using that method.But rather than learn tricks on how to get to a bridge or refrain I would suggest studying a bit of musical theory so you understand how and why it works.Its a bit harder but the end results will likely make it a lot easier for you.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,deswpmw,5,t5_2qmah

11334245,0,t3_61otxu,K so a beginners guide to drum layering.Find a good loop to start with. Breakbeat samples are a dime a dozen just find something that works. Its primary job is to serve as a template for your layers and add some authenticity.Now layering is all about synergy. Your layered samples should reinforce and  or complement a key characteristic of your loop. If the loop has punch but lacks lowend thats what your layered kick and snare should bring to the table.In mixing then the loop can take quite a lot of abuse because your layers bring the fidelity. A rule of thumb is to EQ the loop until its key parts are heard clearly and then compress to bring out some transients. Then you use the layers to balance it  again if the loop is short on sub bass thats when you bring up the  Hz band of the layered kick. If your DAW allows you to route all of it into a group and do your final shaping EQ dynamics on the group.One final thing Microtiming makes all the difference. Shifting a layer just by a few ms is pivotal and you need to figure out how your particular DAW allows you to do this. There is very little science involved  just nudge your tracks around and listen.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dfgptjr,2,t5_2qmah

The snaretom issue is at a point now where I didnt even notice it didnt really even remember it was an issue until I came back to your comment to reread it. Dont worry about it.

11389336,0,t1_dfmhzdy,Hey! Sorry logged off reddit for a bit.I think it wouldnt be too hard to write lyrics Ive already got a few melodies floating in my head. The long whole notes of the bass really lends itself to being able to be layered with other voices on top of it.As far as music theory goes I like the minor key the beat is very chill. I might say the drums themselves are a bit simple and some nice jazzy syncopation could liven it up a bit. I also think its missing crash cymbals which would provide it with some nice accents. Maybe this was a stylistic choice though. I also notice in genres you have it listed as dance music so maybe the simple drum rhythm was also a stylistic choice to make it easier to dance to.As far as mixing goes Im not too great at that and couldnt provide anything constructive I think it was mixed pretty well from what I can tell. I think my biggest issue is a few random crash cymbals here and there could go a long way with providing impact and accents to certain important spots and maybe add a kick to the crash cymbal spots as kicks really beef up crashes.I think with some lyrics and some crashes this could be a nice track. I still really enjoyed it nonetheless. I like minor key darker stuff like this. Triphoppy.,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dfmynt6,1,t5_2qmah

My method has been to just keep making the best music I can push on even when it feels pointless because Im coming to learn theres a huge difference between it feeling pointless and being pointless and not to elevate myself by hurling a small dossier of insults at fellow musicians.There are people in my area doing exceptionally well and I absolutely think their music is generic. Im also aware that its largely why theyre doing well. Similar to OP Im in a slightly niche genre and thats fine. If it takes a while if its tooth and nail thats fine because Im doing what I want to do and making what I want to make.For me at least the two are relevant only because theyre both music related. ,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dfx0ir1,1,t5_2qmah

11480598,0,t1_dfxap35,Reading around a bit it looks like people are saying that main synth was an Oberheim OBMX  There is a free Oberheim emulation thats really really good OBXD  Arturia has also emulated a couple other Oberheim models the SEM and the Matrix As far as the machine sound from Reptile that was a sample from a movie called Leviathan  There is a heavy bass synth that accompanies it but Im not sure what synth that would have come from.  It sounds almost like he sampled a heavy sawtooth bass note and detuned it.  He has done that a lot sampling something then detuning it for a heavy sound.  I know he did that a lot on Broken with the guitars.  Trent also layers synths like crazy.  One of the synths he used on TDS was a super rare MoogOberheim prototype.If youre wanting a VST that will get you good ambient sounds I love Absynth   I use it for pretty much all of my ambeintweird soundscapes.Reaktor also has some really interesting ensembles for ambient and anything else for that matter.  Ive been really into Metaphysical Function lately.Honestly one of the best places to start is to get the Komplete bundle from Native Instruments.  It has the ability to do just about everything youre looking for.  Its not exactly cheap  but its a steal for the amount of stuff you get this would give you Monark Reaktor and Abysnth  among many many other instruments which includes one of the best samplers on the market Kontakt.Just so you know where Im coming from here is my soundcloud,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dfxbmst,2,t5_2qmah

Bought a VExpressions pack for the TD and the sounds in the module came to life  great for standalone.Newest edition is an SPDSX. I recommend one of these to EVERY drummer. Its far easier to load my own samples into one of these than any sample player Ive come across within a DAW. Full MIDI functionality and external trigger inputs.

11722514,0,t3_679tgx,Ableton is more oriented to complex creation and is a favourite of electronic producers. Its a little more daunting to learn and very very nerdy but it has some of the industrys top features. FL Studio is more oriented to loopbased arrangement and is a favourite of hip hop producers. Its easier to learn and definitely easier on the eyes and brain but it does have a stigma from being easily pirated and used poorly by people who dont know any better.However both DAWs have pretty much standard workflows and the differences are indiscernible to skilled users. Since youre comfortable with FL try not to switch over as learning the new interface and attempting to be as open and creative with the new software will take up time where you should be learning better things or making music. I have never heard someone positively advocating switching over though super experienced producers can be comfortable with more than one DAW. Try the demo. Do you REALLY REALLY like Ableton?

Becoming a master composer isnt worth it if I dont know how to do basic things like socialize cook clean excercise and so on. I think its important to find a balance between many things that you love and many things that are good for you. Put most of your effort in to the thing you are most passionate about but dont abandon everything else for it. You never know when another skill will help your music career. Perhaps learning Japanese will open up your music career to Japan. You may stumble upon a Japanese producer or agent who loves your music.
