It will take more time to master OS X than iOS because of this.  The only answer persevere and have grit.The Big Nerd Ranch book is probably the best current API book there is.  Im not happy that everything is Swift  plenty can still only be done with ObjC and C on OS X.   There are earlier editions in ObjC but they do not cover the latest  OS X revisions and added features  youll have to fill in the gaps from Swift or other sources.OS X is broad enough that there will always be corners that are new and unexplored even if youve done OS X development for a while. Beyond this advice I can only ask what specifically are you hoping to create?  I can probably point you in the right direction if you are more specific.  It may not be a specific book or website however  sometimes the obstacles are conceptional and you need a hint to get past them.,cocoa,d31k9el,8,t5_2qhih
