Basement is cracking and needs sealed. the furnance and AC is more that  years old etc. The house seems to be no longer an investment but a money pit. I have remolded the kitchen and bathrooms in hopes of selling some day. At this point my kids are grown and I dont need this size house. I thought I could always sell at some point and make a profit. At this point I cant break even. Theres the dilema. How much money do I throw at it that I will never get back?

Honestly I would just make a budget and see what your comfort zone payment is.  If the  year mortgage is close then Id say go for it.  Option  is that you could also get a cheaper home with a  year mortgage so that the payments are the same as a more expensive home with a  year program.  The thing about shortertermed mortgage is that you are going to build equity faster.  So in  years you will own a lot more of your home than you do had you gotten a  year mortgage.

I always say I can do it in  hours but most of the time it takes under an hour really  mins tops. The brokerbanker if hes good should have a lot more clients and they may not be able to drop everything at that minute to do it. Furthermore you may have complicated income. I had a client who owns a ton of business and I needed to review over  sets of business returns to calculate his income. That took several days to do as I wanted to review it with an underwriter.

6394643,0,t3_430618,I hate to say it but there are a lot of people in our business that are lazy shady incompetent or some combination thereof. I often say that if other lenders were good at their jobs my job would be much more difficult. That said there are also  sides to every story. If the lender had everything since October and didnt submit until last week why? How long was your contract?  days is standard so why did you have a contract of days or more? Does the inclusion of a housing counselor mean that you are getting grant money? If so might the lender have been waiting on that to come through they are often a nightmare to deal with. Itd be impossible for the lender to submit with pay stubs bank statements etc that were submitted in October as any lender would need more current documentation.

6964529,0,t3_4b3hqj,A. . points on the front is a lot but . is a very good interest rate especially on a small loan like that. Look at the savings monthly over the  years on the new loan vs the old one and the year that youd be taking off of the current repayment schedule. B If they are making you pay a year up front then you should be getting a refund of your current escrow balance from your current lender. Look and see what you have in escrows now on your statement and expect a check for that much about  weeks after closing. C This is most likely because your taxes have gone up and your current lender hasnt caught on yet. Expect that if you stay in your current loan youll be seeing an increase to offset the hike in taxes plus additional funds due to pay for the shortage they are creating by under collecting at this point. You can check here  D The title company will make an aggregate adjustment just before closing to make sure they are on the right schedule. No one is allowed to make money off of your escrows so if they are over collected youll get a refund once an escrow analysis is done by your servicer at the latest.

7005153,0,t1_d1a7gjl,While I appreciate a healthy dose of skepticism youve jumped too far with assumptions. Let me clear those assumptions up so that I can get real input in the question posed and not a stern talkingto.. We are not using the builders lender. We shopped around with multiple references from our agent and friends.  As far as I know the bank does not even know who the builder is yet. All the lenders offered the rate lock options for the new construction period under different terms but the actual rates were the same across lenders.. The credit is coming from the lender and has nothing to do with the builder. They bank is offering the credit toward closing to win our business. The lenders we vetted were all aggressive to win our business and many offered matching rates and terms..  The k is a deposit with the lender not the builder.  For the bank the require a deposit from us so that we dont easily walk away within a month from closing and find another lender. If the deal doesnt close because its the builders fault we would get that money back. If the deal doesnt close because we walk away to another lender they keep the money. Is it a good deal for us? It depends. Its a tradeoff for us to put money down vs having piece of mind that our rates are locked where we are comfortable with them to be. . We have not put the financing before the home. We have to make a decision on financing shortly lock now or wait.  That does not imply that we are putting financing before the home. Its just one of the many decision to make.. We have inspection clauses in the signed offer. Our lawyer is also actively working to ensure inspection clauses are there for both the borrower and lender in the PampS agreement. Lastly we are not buying anywhere close to the top of our budget. We were preapproved for .M.  If rates go up . I wont be happy but we wont be house poor.,Mortgages,d1adn0y,2,t5_2ql1v

You can talk with your current lender about a refi you can go on lendingtree and receive a ton of calls from different lenders to get their infomation talk to a new bank etc. Settlement services are going to be rolled into the loan amp appraisal is what youre going to have to pay out of pocket normally. Why does your house look like shit? Are there structural or habitability issues? Youll want to ensure no before the appraiser does. Youve gotta figure out what you want the refi to do for your current financial situation amp worry about features later if at all rate. Every MLO you speak with and puts actual options in front of you is going to need to pull credit to take a look.  First pull is a hard inquiry with a negative impact each pull after for a  day period you are ok for other lenders to take a look. If you can improve your credit score why havent you? Docs youll need are typical docs like when you purchased home  ws paystubs bank statements ID homeowners insurance declaration page of course other docs if you are self employed or investment properties etc. I hope this helps. ,Mortgages,d9rx7tr,1,t5_2ql1v

10733568,0,t3_5tih38,just get the mortgage from the beginning. Since you have the assets you can easily make up any of the finance contingencies. If it doesnt appraise for your offer then you just put more into your cash part of the purchase. Or even better you let the bank do your negotiating and your new offer is closer to the appraised value. Youre better off going in with a higher offer a fair amount down and then negotiating the credits and repairs. For a .mm purchase everyone will be working to make sure the deal goes through. They all want to get paid and you should get good service. Your Redfin agent wants the cash offer because it removes all uncertainty and he gets the deal closed much faster. Not sure I would use a Redfin agent for that size purchase. Plus if youre  invested youre probably going to take a tax hit when you sell those funds. Dont underestimate the mortgage interest deduction. Million dollar mortgage gives you about k in interest deductions one will save you a fair amount in taxes each year. If you can get  in your index funds is leave the money there. ,Mortgages,ddn35d2,1,t5_2ql1v

11007177,0,t1_def7361,First off given all of the political chatter welcome to the US!  Im happy you are here!  I know it may be salt on the wound but we offer loans for L visa holders as well.  Fannie and Freddie are supportive of these visas so you just need to find a lender that doesnt have overlays for this.  Overlays means guideline requirements overlayed on top of the basic guideline requirements.  Some banks dont want certain loan types so they overlay requirements on top of what the bare minimum required to sell their loan to Fannie and Freddie.  This all noted if your loan amount is above the conforming levels then you will have limited options yet there still are options given your status.  ,Mortgages,defmsby,3,t5_2ql1v

11212246,0,t3_5zuolx,Depending on how far you are in the process I would highly consider you to consider using only a qualified GC and not sub everything out! The reason for this is simple.  Too many crews in the kitchen at one time will create potential chaos.  We do not allow multiple subs on a general renovation under a fhak with our firm  its a big mistake.  Multiple permits pulled by different subs can create delays and frustration with your project.  The other big issues is payment to the subs.  The more subs the more inspections and cost you will incur and I can tell you when those subs are ready to get paid and there is a delay on the draw due to concerns over work performed stopping the the pay train over an inspection which could be also holding up other subs is a stress headache. Further I would ask this loan officer who is actually paying these contractors. If this loan officers company is shipping the file after closing to another company for these subs to get paid not only do you have another stress of making sure these subs get paid on a timely fashion but also managing the drama when they dont get paid. Its a real simple question to ask the loan officer ..will you in house payment via direct deposit to the subs bank account internally  and if the answer is NO then get ready for a bumpy ride.  From years of originating renovations mortgages I would never encourage a multi sub involvement on a Fhak loan where the work is more than minor repair.  If you need more answers to your questions let me know and I would be more than happy to provide you our contact info for answering additional questions.,Mortgages,df2w8kc,2,t5_2ql1v

11351817,0,t3_6202z7,Youre right on the edge of  LTV without counting your closing costs and prepaids rebuilding your escrow. That being said if the home does appraise for K you may be able to bring a little money to close on the loan to make sure youre not paying PMI. My other big question here is what rate do you currently have? FHA is typically much lower than the comparable  year conventional mortgage. It honestly may not make any sense for you to try and refinance due to that fact. If you will be paying as much in interest with your new loan as you are right now in interest and MIP combined there is no point in my opinion. ,Mortgages,dfiphb0,3,t5_2ql1v

Theyre clearly trying to interfere with my comparison shopping by wasting all my time on the phone so that I cant talk to anyone else. And the last time I went with an online lender I nearly got sued because they just did not give a shit about doing what they said and made a liar out of me numerous times.Secondly its probably not worth saving an extra few bucks to get the better rate now if anything I can refinance when the rates are good again rather than be a jerk.,Mortgages,dga3sz9,4,t5_2ql1v

The loan officer a recent college graduate said I would not qualify because I only had a single year of business tax returns. There was wiggle room but either he did not know or was not empowered to make a decision. I went to a small local bank and they funded the loan. Sure I needed a big down payment but it got done. Go small especially if you have any sort of atypical circumstance. ,Mortgages,dgilnb3,1,t5_2ql1v
