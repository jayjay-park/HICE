Why not check local bird rescues?I hope you do more research and have some hands on experience before taking the plunge but I commend you for wanting to give a shelter bird a home.Based on comment history it appears you are in central Illinois.I cannot speak for any of these organizations but google turned upLists of rescues,Conures,cnmyvwu,3,t5_2uvez

If we dont want redirects here we need to let rparrots know about rconure instead of being a downvote dick.,Conures,czwk3qp,1,t5_2uvez

If he attacks you tell him no grab him gently with a dish towel and put him in the cage and ignore him. Use a dish towel so its thin enough that you can feel him. Make sure he has plenty of things to chew on. And get lots of bird safe bells that he can wack around. Conures get wound up and can be aggressive at times. They need toys to be aggressive towards.I let my bird on my shoulder and hardly ever have any issues with biting. When a bird wants to be handled he will throw himself at you and demand snuggles. Be patient with you bird and over time you will bond. With parrots it discipline discipline reinforced discipline and mutual respect. ,Conures,d12y0ov,1,t5_2uvez

Hes a great dancer but a terrible singer. Hes a fan of indie music and gets very grumpy when I try to soothe him with soft instrumentals like piano or guitar. He also tried to talk over my happiness podcast I guess he thinks his advice is better.Your conure sounds like quite the personality! What words can she say? Did she always know how to talk?,Conures,dbtj0jl,1,t5_2uvez
