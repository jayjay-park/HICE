350187,0,t3_1y3ku2,Congratulations on making your first step towards the financial blackhole that AP astrophotography is!Just a few notes phone cameras are good at snapping pics at daylight but for astronomy pictures they are bad because they lack the manual exposure control and the automated ones just do not cut it when subjected to the high contrasts and low overall luminosity of space objects. But you can still use one to snap pictures of the Moon! Ive seen quite a few of those around this subreddit.As far as AP goes youll need at least a DSLR camera and an adapter to attach that to your telescope as well as a sturdy and preferably motorized mount for longerexposure pictures. But if set up you can take absolutely amazing pictures like the ones found on this subreddit.Alternatively a repurposed webcam can be a good tool for planetary imaging.After that theres a need for special software to process the images there are quite a few free tools for that on the internets.I cant really give you any solid suggestions as I am myself just getting into this but you can find plenty of guides or a person who knows more than I do.Clear skies to you.,Astronomy,cfh2c3p,3,t5_2qhor
366149,0,t1_cfinm6t,No it is only visible if you are near the beam and looking at the same direction mainly because the air is so very pure up there little dust to reveal the beam.  We use a sodium ion laser which is an orange beam I think it is somewhere around  watts.However we have taken great timelapse where the beam is very visibleWe also use it as an artificial guide star if there is not a real star in a good position.,Astronomy,cfipt1t,1,t5_2qhor
378619,0,t1_cfjv8vc,edit full disclosure I dont know all that much about what Im talking about so dont trust my answer completely.Yes the mirror itself also blocks some of the light. If you look closely however the beams called spiders from the vantage point of light coming in are actually quite thin especially in comparison with the enormous primary mirror. The amount of light blocked by these spiders and secondary mirror do negatively impact the quality of the image but only by a very small amount. There is however an effect called diffraction that is more important than the lightgathering power concern. Diffraction is caused when light passes near edges of things on its way to the primary causing them to bend and change direction slightly. Additionally secondaries and spiders cause scattered light  light coming in from offaxis i. e.  not part of the patch of sky you are viewing and bounce off the structures and into and around the optical system. The result of diffraction and scattering is a small loss of contrast  the background sky is not as black as it would be. Basically it is what it is the way they adjust for it is by making it very large. The fact that its so big negates the effects some. Also when they take images it isnt so simple as a click of the camera. As an example Hubble a very similar telescope in order to get this image of the spiral galaxy NGC  took  pictures over the course of  weeks and stitched them together. Im sure they write some fancy programming stuff in there to further deal with the issue but thats beyond me I only have a very basic understanding of this stuff. For more information Id recommend reading through this as thats where majority of my knowledge comes from.As to whether the fact that the beam of light coming off the tertiary mirror goes through the light going into and coming off of the primary mirror affects the image quality or not I dont have a clue. This is all from me googling stuff but it seems that photons do attract each other but the amount that they attract each other is so minuscule it can be ignored. I may be wrong but it seems like if that did have a noticeable impact on the trajectory of the photons none of them would be reaching earth even slightly according to how the subject looks like theres plenty of light coming from other places in space youd have way more stray photons going through the photons originating from the subject than the photons of the subject crossing through other photons from the subject in the telescope. And anyways if that was a problem the problem would be present also from the primary mirror. Sorry this isnt well articulated its late and Im just kind of thinking aloud,Astronomy,cfk0clj,3,t5_2qhor

814225,0,t3_23g56x,Astronomers try to understand stars better all the time. There are various types of variable stars and in order to understand them better astronomers look at a number of factors. One of those is the brightness changes of a star over time. A simple type of variable star is a Cepheid variable like Delta Cephei. It pulsates up and down in magnitude over a fairly fixed type of schedule but there is variation among even them  those with larger magnitude fluctuations magnitude range have a longer amount of time between the peaksvalleys of their brightness period. Smaller variations have shorter periods.But there are other kinds too  some are eruptive variable stars that we have learned build up carbon on their surface and then do something to blow it off which brightens the stars substantially. Others brighten up over very long periods and can get very dim like Mira in Cetus.In order for astronomers to know what is happening with any given star  or to see what was happening to a star prior to a strange event such as a novasupernova  it helps to be able to go back and look at the stars record or magnitude fluctuations compared to period. Or they may be studying a certain type of variable and need to be able to view the record of many variables within a given type of variable star like Cepheids for example.It helps us understand the stars better. And there are FAR too many of them and this can be somewhat mundane tedious tasks for astronomers to be able to commit scarce professional astronomical resources to these stars every night. So amateurs can contribute a lot to this field by observing them and sharing their variable star magnitude estimates. This has gotten much more automated in some cases with some amateurs using photometry equipment to submit variable star magnitudes for many stars over a given night automatically but visual estimates are still useful and accepted.,Astronomy,cgwtxem,1,t5_2qhor

956040,0,t3_252dda,Part The Sun itself will continue to exist for many billions of years passing through a number of phases and eventually ending up as a longlived white dwarf. Eventually after billions more years the Sun will finally cease to shine altogether becoming a black dwarf.  So there is a chance that if all things go right humans could live to see the Andromeda galaxy merge with the Milky Way before the Sun gets us.  Hopefully by that time we will have evolved means to leave earth and travel to other planets.Further on down the line is what is thought of to be the Big Freeze.  Due to the never ending and actually accelerating universe expansion everything on the cosmic level is becoming further and further apart.  Existing stars will burn out stars will not be created due the lack of large clumped up gas clouds called stellar nurseries and the universe will go dark.  Over a much longer time scale in the eras following this the galaxy evaporates as the stellar remnants comprising it escape into space and black holes evaporate via Hawking Radiation.  Proton decay will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons such as positrons and electrons and photons.  Anything beyond that point is not completely agreed upon. New theories such as multiverses string theory and new experiments at places such as the Large Hadron Collider might possibly help put those pieces together one day.The one thing that I have learned that always brings a smile on my face is knowing that the molecules that make up my body are of the same composition as the universe.  Humans were born from stars and they might one day die from one.Thanks for reading all of this Sorry it was a wall of text I tried to break it up but doing tab at paragraphs made that line small and no matter how many times I hit enter it only puts in one line break.

1075757,0,t3_26ew6g,To elaborate further on why this is more likely a satellite than a meteor...A meteor in the atmosphere flares out just before disappearing giving it a distinct trail that becomes brighter the longer its visible. This picture from the Perseid meteor shower is a good example of this.Satellites are defined by their path being slightly curved as they are orbiting the Earth and remain relatively constant in how bright they appear. An overhead pass of the ISS best illustrates this.Depending on how long its visible and at what altitude it reaches in the sky a satellite will become brighter before dimming as it returns to the horizon. This is due to the satellite being closer to the observer the higher up in the sky it appears  degrees in altitude would be directly overhead.Also the little gaps in the trail of the ISS are likely the result of a number of pictures being overlayed to avoid over exposing the image.,Astronomy,chqkfej,4,t5_2qhor

I think what it comes down to is that the things are technically smaller than Hubbles diffraction limit something like  mas but the PSF is so well known that you can convolve models with the PSF and still figure out structural parameters for the nuclei.Thats not helping to explain why AO wasnt used though. I think I have some questions to ask my supervisor tomorrow gtit should be possible to resolve them with other telescopes.This is certainly true for resolving the nucleus as a whole. What I meant in my first post is that these things are too small for current telescopes to resolve individual stars in the nuclei  then youre getting into the realm of as and ELTs.

2052457,0,t3_2ibsi6,Its fairly simple the celestial pole North NCP or South SCP depending on your hemisphere resides in the sky at altitude equal to your latitude.The celestial coordinates axes are named Right Ascention similar to the longitude of the terrestrial one marked in hours from  to  with  and  being same point related to  and  of the circle and Declination similar to the latitude goes from  near SCP to  at NCP just like latitude is  at equator and goes to  at NorthSouth pole. For a starobject in the sky not to set in a particular latitude it has to be at latitude declination. For lat of  thats anything northsouth of  depending on hemisphere. And for that object to pass through zenith it has to be at declination equal to your latitude so star at  dec will pass through zenith at  latitude and will never set because  is greater than . Following me still?Similar logic applies to starobject visibility at latitudes for it to be visible it has to be at declination of latitude opposite to the equator from objects celestial hemisphere. In case of Crux its .This math also means that observers on the Earths equator will be able to observe all of the celestial objects to a degree higher declination objects will never rise higher than latdec altitude however. And its vice versa at the NorthSouth pole all of the visible objects will never set and the NCPSCP will be directly overhead.Hope that helped to grasp the basics of celestial coordinate to earth coordinate and object visibility concepts.,Astronomy,cl0po5m,1,t5_2qhor

Since the secondary mirror is close to the primary mirror its image gets focused farther away from the eyepiece. If you stand a couple of feet behind the eyepiece and look try to look through it you should be able to see the structure holding up the secondary mirror. So when you do look through the eyepiece the normal way with your eye close to the eyepiece the light from the secondary mirror structure is still there it just does not converge to form an image at that distance. ,Astronomy,cljh2wq,1,t5_2qhor

Why is it hard to believe in both God and Science?The text contradicts science. Simple as that. Mainstream Christians believe in a personal god that placed the first two humans on Earth. A god that hears your thoughts and once flooded the Earth. They are theists not deists. But yes I agree that the deist god you describe is absolutely compatible with science.

2327411,0,t1_clz7l66,Ive reread your second paragraph and I still cant decipher your stance on evolution. That might be my fault though I havent had my coffee yet. Deism is generally used to refer to the belief in an impersonal god who set things in motion. Theism is belief in a personal god that hears prayers and intervenes in daytoday life. It sounds like youre somewhere between the two but most Christians fall squarely in the theist camp. It all depends how much of the Bible you believe and how much you believe literally. So for a Christian who believes god placed the first two humans on earth once flooded the earth for a whole year and often performs miracles it becomes hard to also believe in science. Its even harder if youre in the young earth camp. ,Astronomy,clzdq6p,2,t5_2qhor

2407559,0,t3_2mzc24,gt Itd be like climbing to the top of a tall building mapping the horizon and assuming that was the whole cosmos.Except maps dont claim to show the whole cosmos only the observable universe.The observable universe as the name implies consists of the small part of universe that can actually be seen from our very own tall building rooftop Our solar system.Theres only so many square miles you can map from the rooftop in your analogy before youre limited by the horizon which is dependent on the curvature of the Earth. Your observable land is a D space with a circle boundary the horizon and of which you are right in the center. Mapping the universe is no different except in D and with a different boundary limited not by the horizon but by the speed of light. What we can see is still circular shaped because light older than the age of the universe has not had enough time yet to reach us.This is why were in the center of the observable universe because by definition its the only part we can see and thats why its shaped like a sphere.Now heres whats interesting  We know the value of c and we know the age of the universe. So theoretically we can only see stuff that are at best as old as the universe. Nothing older than that since light produced by those objects hasnt had enough time to reach us yet. So the diameter of the observable universe should be . billion lightyears across right ?But its not. Its  billion lightyears according to the most recent studies.This is where the tall building analogy has its shortcomings in that it doesnt account for the expansion of the universe. If the universe were fixed the above calculation would be right but because the universe is expanding we can actually see objects further than those . bn lightyears.When light was emitted from those objects it started travelling towards us. But the universe is expanding ! So an object that emitted light when it was  bn lightyears away can now be  or  billion lightyears away due to expansion arbitrary numbers you get the idea.TLDR Due to laws of physics and as the name implies we actually are the center of the observable universe.,Astronomy,cm9a7i1,4,t5_2qhor

Back in the s and even through most of the s into the s what you got in one exposure on your emulsion film was what you printed and that was that. The greatest gift to astrophotography in the s and s was the availability of Kodak Technical Pan  originally developed for U.S. Spy Planes and later used by Astronomical Observatories  it was extremely popular due to the incredibly fine grain and with gas hypering and technidol developer it was incredibly sensitive. The best Light Pollution filters blocked ONLY Mercury Vapor. There were no affordable Narrowband Filters until the mid s and the introduction of digital cameras DSLR and dedicated astronomy cameras from SBIG. The best Light Pollution filters blocked ONLY Mercury Vapor.Times have certainly changed. Now there are so many technical marvels available to the astrophotoimager  being that I came from a long history of emulsion astrophotography I refuse to call todays digital imaging astrophotography as there is no actual photographic emulsionchemistry involved. So with astroimaging it is more a matter of budget than skill although anyone who is successful must have a lot of knowledge of how to capture and process images and a lot of persistence and the learning curve is sharp.

The one Im most familiar with describes our universe as the sum total of all dark matter dark energy and regular matter everything as it were. There are then other spheres though the exact geometry is not clear of universes that can be as different as you want. Universes that dont have dark energy or dark matter or maybe are dominated by them no real limit because the physical laws of each universe can be completely different and so those laws would allow for things that cant exist in our universe.As for the board on which all universes are set it isnt entirely clear where this board came from. But it would spawn each universe from a point. In this case each universe has kind of an inverse event horizon  if you could ever travel outside your universe to the large board you would never be able to return like the inverse of entering a black hole and not being able to come back out.In this particular model aside from occasional collisions there would be no links or relations between universes.

3797385,0,t3_33vlsx,What alt az tripod do you have? Usually most accept a vixen style dovetail. You can either buy tube rings or if youre feeling handy you can just drill slots to install a dovetail directly AFTER removing the mirror. The latter is slightly cheaper arguably more stable in the long run but voids warranty and runs the risk of mucking something up. Once you have the dovetail setup youll have no problems mounting it to any AZ or EQ mount that isnt crud.A properly designed and mounted Alt Az will have no problem looking directly at high objects the only difference is that you will need to nudge the scope in both horizontal and vertical directions. Once you polar align the eq mount you only need to move it one direction to track your target. If you dont mind me asking what mount did you get? That might help me narrow it down. There are other tricks you can use to increase stability in the tripod if your  AZ is the one I think it is part of the problem is that on its original fork mount its not quite properly balanced you need to move it forward unfortunately only way I know of doing so is via drilling some holes. You can also epoxy the lose joints and fill some of the legs with sand. As to whether or not its worth it the answer depends on you and your budget. I dont know if the AZ has a spherical or a parabolic mirror but I dont think its of the birdjones variety so that is at least a plus. Certainly adding a dovetail makes it more useful and it can sometimes be nice to have a beater scopelighter scope you can take to star partiesoutreach events and the like. There are also several inexpensive upgrades you can do to increase the performance of your scope flocking making sure its always collimated et cetera. Alternatively you can focus on upgrading your eyepieces  plossls arent expensive and are a good general purpose starting point. Its all about moderation  there isnt a whole lot of point in spending thousands of dollars upgrading an inexpensive scope. Try to focus on accessories that you can use on multiple scopes if you go that way.,Astronomy,cqp4rep,1,t5_2qhor

4193921,0,t3_38vz0z,Hello uGwenKattenAstromaster The Astromaster  is a birdjonescatadiopter which means an additional lens in the focuser tries to correct the flaws of a short possibly spherical mirror causing a few problems collimation chromatic aberration contrast. Stay away from newtonian telescopes with a much shorter tube then their focal length. This does not apply for Maksutovs and SC.Alternatives For the same budget you could get a few other telescopes but your choices are limited.UsedFor  your best choice is to wait and get a used telescope. A used  dobsonian would be your best choice the  even better but rarely sells for under . I also asume the AWB Onesky  and refurbished XT.  are out of your price range.Improve a cheap telescopeIf you do not mind a bit of DIY work you can get a real long  for as low as  on a weak mount amp tripod and build a simple rockerboxmount for it  materials hand saw. I did this with th graders and it is really really easy. Perhaps  for a few better accessories as well. This way youll get a telescope that otherwise costs  for under !Offtheshelf there are few optionsSadly the Celestron and Meade  and  have gotten a bit more expensive just recently I have no clue why.  EQ good telescope very weak  mountThe EQ mount of  this one and that one is a bit better then the one of the  telescope but still not very rigid! A problem almost all telescopes in the price region lt share and the reason they sell those short birdjones telescopes in order to sell a weak cheap mount.   decent telescope weak mountThis one is a bit more rigid sadly the similar Meade Polaris is not available for  anymore has a larger aperture but the focal length and mirror quality perform a little less on planets. I would favor this one in regard of stability. Do not underestimate the importance of stability as it is very annoying at high magnifications and makes it hard to track observe and find objects.  table top telescope  rigid but limitedIn regards of stability and for widefield observations the mm table top dobsonian performs well but not so much for planets. I would not got higher then about x on planets. The more expensive  AWB OneSky or the  will perform much much better.  So it also depends a bit on what targets you like to observe and what you expect.Maksutov Short but goodIf you already own a rigid camera tripod you coud consider getting a compact mm Maksutov like the c but it will not perform as well as most mm or mm aperture telescopes which allow for a bit more magnification before the image gets dim and dull. Also limited for deepsky.  Still I have one and its fun to use. Sadly the  Maksutov are over your budget newtonian reflectors of similar size tend to be quite a bit cheaper.Aperture wins A larger aperture is one of the most important factors as it gathers more light and has a higher resolution effectively showing more. What to expect in a  Telescope Great introduction and comparison The difference between Refractors and Reflektors is too exaggerated IME Simulation of  aperture Galaxy M after longer observation in   . inchYMMV. Also see the influence of light pollution here for planets it does not matter as they are bright.  Saving for something thatll last a life timeIf you are looking for a telescope that has less flaws less compromises consider saving for a  or  dobsonian used  new  or at least the XT. for  A . or  telescope can be very nice but with the larger one youre set for years to come and on a dobsonian rockerbox there are no stability issues even at higher magnifications even with the simpler altitudeazimuth tracking its more fun then a shaky equatorial mount.While in a  or  telescope Galaxy M appears as two bright cores with a bit of structure under a very dark sky a  is capable of showing you the faint spiral structure of this any other galaxies if the conditions allow. The  aperture will show more planetary details and allows for higher magnification if the seeing conditions are good. its the best bang for the buck That said I have two larger telescopes a few smaller... I use the  AWB Onesky the most as its so portable. But under a dark sky I would not want to miss the extra aperture of the larger dobsonian. If you also consider using the telescope as a spotting scope the small C Maksutov is your best bet. It also fits into a small backpack along with a tripod and is a neat secondary telescope.,Astronomy,cryazpu,1,t5_2qhor

MK plasma is the bright stuff in those movies. The dark material is cooler plasma mostly hydrogen at a few thousand Kelvin. It appears dark because it is absorbing emission from the bright background corona so were seeing a silhouette of the tornado. These tornadoes are part of the structure of prominences. Theyre not actually all that uncommon I could link you to quite a few examples but dont have any right onhand. SDO has seen loads of these things. The problem comes when we try to catch them with smallfov spectrometers and things like that. Theyre transient and somewhat unpredictable. Although the magnetic fields are extremely important in tornadoes and prominences in general its not magnetic reconnection. At least reconnection has not been mentioned in ANY of the discussions that Ive had on the topic. Were still trying to figure out what the magnetic field orientation and structure actually is in these tornadoes. actually kinda agtThe first one was only reported in about  Professor Cairns said.Not true the term tornado has been used in conjunction with prominences since the s though its true that with the launch of SDO that people started seeing them in different wavebands and showing interest in them again.,Astronomy,cuxskcx,1,t5_2qhor

You can sometimes get them for under  they perform at least as good s the AWB regarding planets due to their design but they often come on weak mounts you can easily build a rockerbox for them though if youre handy.You can get the Celestron Powerseeker eq for  over there but the EQ is very weak for the long tube. Also stay away of newtonian reflector telescopes with much shorter tube than their focal length while we are at it as the birdjones design has a few flawsAperture is key check out the links at  The Heritage p is not ideal for planets due to its mirror quality amp obstruction but its a good allrounder and will still beat the smaller ones. And will even be useful once you got a larger telescope. I use mine as travel telescope more than my larger one I have a identical telescope to the one youve linked to and also other entry level telescopes Heritage p for example or  equatorial. They all can show quite a bit but the larger one just show significantly more while the price is still moderate.Also note that the resell value of a good telescope is better than for one of those cheap departmentstore type telescopes.

Often when you meet people who are doing great jobs and ask them what they studied to get there their quals are unrelated. Exceptions doctors lawyers accountants. People end up in great jobs because of many good choices and hard work not because of a degree alone. My only real caveat is that if youre not mature enough to study yet stop and pick it up later. Dont go jumping from degree to degree racking up debt hoping that the next one will be the right one. I dont know how old you are but some people are ready for university at  others at .

Most bachelors degrees take at least  calndear years to get and many take  to even  or  years TO EARN. Are talking about getting a graduate degree or a professional degree Like masters of scince degree. I really do have an EARNED college degrees and one attempted masters degree in geophysics. I majored in history of science Earth scinces  geology.  and physical geography and M.S. In geology and specialized in remote sensing and GIS  geographic information systems.Do you really have only a semester left on some type of bachelors  degree or was that just hook and bait to see who would answer the question.  This is only my second comment on reddit so I am still on the learning curve figuring out how reddit works. i did an advanced searched on astronomy that made  it newest posts. That is how i found this question.. Not all universities offer degrees with astronomy or astrophysics majors. I really was enrolled at the University of Arizona  years ago as  an astronomy major.. Then i went back to Tulane and got a second bachelors degree in geology and  earth scinces because I was more interested in planets that you can walk on than stars at the time but now stars and how peoples minds work are equally fascinating. I was also a Tulane faculty dependent  and now I have extensive personal life experience  in higher education  in the united States..,Astronomy,cxokntr,1,t5_2qhor

When amateurs telescope makers make something they base it on standard stock pipe bar plate etc. Castings and unusual machined shapes such as metal horseshoe cases are usually not worth it.

I am just dipping the toes here in the astronomy hobby waters  so I dont mind if I am bit under tier of the price range I had. Althought I didnt went only by amazons reviewers I had a space.com article with at least  scopes to choose from.I also added a kit with a couple of eyepieces to help with the range and clarity so is all testing ground for me now.I have a great spot with a big window that I can open with a clear view to the east south hemisphere. Last night I saw Jupiters moon for the first time with a x binoculars and it was awesome. Althought a bit shaky and not really comfortable holding the binoculars for long I think this new TS will maximize my experience.

But regarding planets you could observe from the sidewalk. Light pollution has no effect for bright targets moon planets really.The p is not exactly tiny either but its already showing a lot. At kg its not too heavy either. The large diameter especially with base wont fit in every backpack but a larger one. The only real problem is that its low to the groundSmaller choices are   A . Maksutov on a compact camera tripod very compact but more expensive per inch aperture Bare telescopegt   Heritage p or similar  a bit lower contrast smaller aperture even lower to the groundampnbspThe  mm Maksutov is a fun very portable telescope. Ive used it on a cheap  tripod not so much fun and on a rigid old camera tripod much better. Its narrower field of view and smaller aperture compared to the p will show a bit less field and detail though. The Mak can fit in almost any backpack its that compact. I still use it once in a while when traveling or as daytime spotting scope. Personally I am fine with using the p either sitting on a very small fishing stool or in the grass or finding a table in a park or dragging a box along to put the p on... and enjoy the large field of view. Stool binoculars bookmap and red flashlight  fit into my backpack.ampnbspgt planetary eyepieceMost telescopes come with very basic eyepieces Especially regarding higher magnification they often include no eyepiece or a bad one  cheap barlow.E.g. the p comes with a mm and mm eyepiece gtx amp x magnification the p as well gtx amp x due to the shorter focal length.or planets  is desirable. More if the atmospheric seeing allows.ampnbsp Sure thing binoculars will be more portable But even though they will show more than the naked eye you might only be able to spot a few things under light polluted sky e.g. a faint Andromeda Galaxy as small smudge some open clusters. So traveling a bit out of the city might be required. How bad is the light pollution there? A park might help but if its within the city the light pollution will still be an issue. Avoiding direct light helps but the skyglow is like a dome above populated areas.ampnbspTLDR My two cents Planetsgtpsidewalkdoorstep planetsdeepskyportabilitygtpampbackache  or  Mak  tripod with a bit less aperture binoculars for most portability if you go to a dark location where you can ideally see the milkyway.  ,Astronomy,d6h9uap,2,t5_2qhor

8620315,1,t3_4xuin1,Hey there. Professional astronomer checking in. All these things people have said are nice but none of them are ASTRONOMY. Astronomy isnt about knowing the constellations or looking at stars through a telescope. Its about learning how the universe came to be as it is today. If thats what youre interested in then I would recommend checking out local colleges and see if they have astronomyrelated programs like free lectures. Or get yourself a textbook or a good popular science book and start reading and learning about the subject. And when you get to college take Astro classes. Once you start learning about the SCIENCE of astronomy what you see through a telescope will start to have more meaning than just being pretty. ,Astronomy,d6j51qz,1,t5_2qhor

8731751,0,t1_d6wtmqu,A cool contributing reason that very massive galaxies loose their ability to spawn stars is because very large galaxies typically are found at the interior of galaxy clusters where dust and gas is easily stripped from the galaxy and joins the overall cloud of hot material that is diffused though the entire cluster. This essentially leaves the galaxy naked like a garden when a strong wind took away the nice topsoil. Also because larger galaxies toward the center of clusters ate hotter  hotter gas has less probability to relax and collapse into a stellar core since it is constantly disturbed. ,Astronomy,d6x4582,3,t5_2qhor

Across the heart of the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies lies a striking string of galaxies known as Markarians Chain. The chain pictured above is highlighted on the upper right with two large but featureless lenticular galaxies M and M. Prominent to their lower left is a pair of interacting galaxies known as The Eyes. The home Virgo Cluster is the nearest cluster of galaxies contains over  galaxies and has a noticeable gravitational pull on the galaxies of the Local Group of Galaxies surrounding our Milky Way Galaxy. The center of the Virgo Cluster is located about  million light years away toward the constellation of Virgo. At least seven galaxies in the chain appear to move coherently although others appear to be superposed by chance.Source APODEquipment Takahasi FSQEDX III Paramount MyT QSIwsg  Astrodon filters Lodestar X OAGAcquisition Luminance  x Red  x Green  x Blue  xTotal integration time  . hoursTaken from the Deep Sky West Observatory in Rowe New Mexico.

11443390,0,t3_63ac6l,Hey sorry that some of the comments so far have been neither very helpful nor encouraging.I find the saying every telescope has its sky to be quite true. Even with the most modest optics and the wobbliest mount you can find a lot of enjoyment in observing the sky. Yes all of the options you have picked out have their flaws and couldnt hold a candle to a big scope on a solid mount but thats kind of obvious considering their price point.Whether a cheap telescope will frustrate you or challengeinspire you has a lot to do with the type of person you are. If you have little patience and give up easily these beginner scopes might do more harm than good for you. If however you like to experiment enjoy even the smallest victories and are persistent person these scopes are a great gateway into astronomy.A year ago I was in a similar situation like yours The last time I operated a telescope was ages ago and I really didnt know a lot about the practical aspects of astronomy at all. Since I didnt want to spend a lot of money on something I might lose interest in after a couple of month I bought the Celestron Travelscope  for around . Very small aperture diameter of the light gathering optics and the wobbliest mount you can imagine. Still I very much enjoyed observing simple targets with it planets the Moon bright DSOs. After two months or so the astronomy bug really bit me and I got two new used scopes a  Newtonian on a EQ mount and a  MAK on a VERY underpowered tabletopdobson mount.I got good deals on both of them and got everything for around .Although the Newtonian on the EQ  mount should in theory be the better option than the MAK on the Dobsonian toymount Ive been using the MAK almost exclusively because of how easy it is to set up and operate.Around October of last year I started taking images with a ZWO ASI MC planetary camera. Again almost exclusively using the MAKMiniDob combo which is far from ideal. Yet so far Ive been very happy with the extremely modest results. I still use my crappy mm refractor as my traveltelescope and might some day repurpose it into a quiding scope for a bigger setup.My next upgrade will be a big one The Celestron NexStar Evolution . Its excellent GoTocapabilities are part of the reason why I chose this combo. Many hobbyastronomers on reddit will discourage you from getting a mount with GoTofunctionality. Some of their reasoning is very sound You are spending money on electronics that could go into more aperture or a more stable mount. But what I have read very little of is what I am actually after The sheer quality of life imporvement. I love to break out my telescope and let my girlfriend friends and relatives check out cool targets. Constantly having to slew your scope to keep those targets in view or spending a good amount of time setting up an EQMount to get started can be tedious frustrating and make people you are trying to get excited for this field lose interest.So looking at your options this would be my two cents. Meade ETXAT Cool little scope for observing the moon planets and some bright DSOs. GoTo can be very useful and  is a good price. You will probably put it on a large crate or stool though so keep that in mind.. Astromaster EQ As others have said the optical system of the scope is less than ideal. However I used to have a similar scope as a teenager and enjoyed using it for many years. You will be able to observe the moon planets and brigt DSOs with it probably with more detail than with the ETCAT. However the EQmount is less intuitive to use than the ETXAT is heavier and takes longer to set up. On top of all these drawbacks of the mount it is still not a very stable option and will wobble considerably.. Astromaster AZ Also a nice little scope for observing the moon planets and some bright DSOs. The AZmount is more intuitive and easier to use than the s EQmount but quite wobbly.It all comes down to expectation management. If you plan on using you first scope for years to come without any signigicant upgrade it might actually be better to invest in a  or  Dobsonian. If you plan on just getting your feet wet with bigger scopes to come down the line Id say go for the ETXAT or the AZ.Clear skies!,Astronomy,dft3j7s,1,t5_2qhor

11531004,0,t3_64kr7s,An  Dob will be far and away a better instrument than binoculars.  Yes many deep sky objects can be seen with binos  from a dark site.  However aside from large open clusters and the Andromeda galaxy almost all will appear as just a small faint ghostly smudge.  Binoculars excel in low power wide fields of view.  Great for sweeping the spine of the milky way quick look at the moon M the Beehive Double Cluster Andromeda essentially big objects.  Unfortunately most objects are small.  While you will be able to see many objects with binos to see any detail in these objects you need aperture and magnification with aperture being more important.  Binos are great to start with as they are cheap very portable easy to use and multi functional.  The wide field of view makes finding objects much easier.  Might also invest in a tripod mount for them so your arms dont get tired.  ,Astronomy,dg31i37,4,t5_2qhor

11591951,0,t3_65c8l0,This might be a cheap response but look into Purdue University. They have an amazing program there that includes this field of study. I know some folks getting graduate degrees in their Earth Atmospheric Planetary Science EAPS program and they absolutely love it. And theyre pretty competitive academically so if you can handle the challenge youd come out of the program well off. Google them and contact a professor there. Let them know youre interested in the field. The glory of peofessors is that theyre not like a business and try to sweet talk students into joining them just to add to their numbers. They will help to guide you in the right direction even if their program is not for you. But talk to a professor not an academic counselor  in my experience they dont know as much about specific fields of study especially one as specific as the one youre looking into as one who will actually be in the field of study.  ,Astronomy,dg9yf8h,1,t5_2qhor

Presumably in a vacuum the fall off would really be a function of energy per unit of surface area  eg dissipation would be a function of expansion away from the event... which I presume would be a moderately straightforward integration problem for a reasonable approximation.I suppose Im wondering if theres an existing tolerance estimate for the Earth and an existing estimate for the destructive range of a hypernova? Eg. the point at which the range of energy dissipation meets the limit of the earths tolerance.This is definitely helping to refine the problem ,Astronomy,dgsf573,1,t5_2qhor
