7839179,0,t3_4mlvi5,While I think Grims Videos are kinda entertaining and I appreciate all content creators I wonder why Trion uploads not even semiprofessional guides and videos on their OFFICIAL channel. They should either produce own professional videos or place some very high quality standards for stuff like this... bad promo trinopls,MMORift,d3x6wig,5,t5_3ewsa
7846971,0,t3_4msxbd,Not sure if this is true but I heard the same thing. I guess he drew the short straw and was picked as a scapegoat. A shame really. Despite the bugs there are a few I would have chosen before Anony. This is coming from a raider who has dealt with Anony directly and indirectly many times. There were certainly bugs and issues with the raids there is in every MMO especially ones that really try to push content without sufficient testing time. I can live with and almost expect to an extent bugs in raids but the truly sad part about all of this is how TRIONs PR handled these issues. Any talk that was viewed as dissenting even conversations about said bugs was muted on the official forums. When you have bugs the logical thing would be to discuss those bugs figure out the best way to deal with those bugs when encountered on live and have an open line of communication with the devs regarding these bugs. Instead discussion of bugs were moderated on the forums forum accounts were banned if they didnt have glowing things to say about TRION and TRION even banned individuals in game for a bug that they didnt know how it worked how could they when the lines of communications are so horrible?!.The real shame in all of this is TRIONs PR. You just got a good guy fired because of your incompetence. RIP Anony if this is true.Long live Ocho and Archonix. ,MMORift,d3y2h5t,5,t5_3ewsa

8041118,0,t1_d4jj62f,Never said the raid was perfect at release.  These were all pretty infrequent.  Yes I do remember the waves one and the Duke damage one.  But these were all fixed with the patches later.  Overall the raid was pretty polished for a new release.  Its not any worse than any previous raids that were tested more in pts.  I honestly dont think it was as bad as people are making it out to be.  I mean I get it people are mad at Trion so are a bit biased and will exaggerate a bit but I like to see the big picture and not be swayed so much by emotion.,MMORift,d4jwb0l,-2,t5_3ewsa

9773317,0,t1_dahnl9j,The majority of players are max level and its not that we did everything quickly its that there isnt much there right now. At max level we have  dungeons.  is closed for repairs the second doesnt give completion credit and the third is okay but still has bugs. So theres that pvp the same IAs over and over and thats about it. As a new player youve missed out on a lot of bad moments in the last two years. Trion has made horrible decisions countless times and they have yet to stop. Its not trolling its not nitpicking its something that goes on every day in Rift. Something you will most assuredly see when you hit max level. ,MMORift,dahs051,5,t5_3ewsa
