1301079,0,t3_28zca2,I believe strongly that until Bitcoin has the socalled User Interface Moment where usability really takes life we will continue to see transaction volume stay where it is.I believe in Bitcoin in every way and I enjoy using it however when it comes to transacting in it right now it is just something I do with my friends to settle up owed money. I believe many people CAN use Bitcoin on a daily basis and benefit from it. I just think they dont know it yet.I disagree that people are going out of their way to pay hundreds more to use Western Union I just think that WU has been around long enough and those people are used to paying those fees. Plus they may have not been exposed to BTC and even if they were they may lack the motivation to pursue it as a better method. ,BitcoinThoughts,cifzkwd,5,t5_32213

1308066,0,t3_28zca2,gtNXT states that they have solved the MB transaction limit. Thats great. But why couldnt people have used the bitcoin network as a starting place for the project? There are many ways to integrate many of NXTs features into bitcoin.Thats not the real question is it. That would be Why wasnt Bitcoin with years of headstart and a bunch of paid developers able to implement any of those features?And the answer comes down to that Bitcoin is resistant to change. PeterTodd mentioned repeated flame wars on any suggested change. And imagine someone actually asking it to switch to Point of Stake which in my eyes is superior in many ways... all hell would break loose.gtit is now almost definitive that bitcoin is going to be the dominant currency.Thats an awfully confident prediction in a space thats barely five years old.Besides I dont get the there can be only one sentiment. Just because youre used to fiat working that way doesnt make it a true. Different alts do different jobs. NXT is the workhorse. BTC is the store of value.In fact Gavin Andresen stated that things like microtransactions will likely never work in Bitcoin. The code just doesnt allow for it. There might be no other way than to go Alt.gtOn the contrary working on altcoins undermines the entire premise of cryptocurrencies. Seriously? How can all the innovation from the alts be a bad thing?Besides testing new ideas it also puts competitive pressure on Bitcoin.gtConsider if somehow NXT were able to take the lead over bitcoin. Were that to happen nobody would invest in any cryptocurrency again because the precedent would be set that perhaps litecoin could supplant NXT a few months later. Consider if MySpace would be somehow replaced by Facebook. Nobody would invest time in it because Instagram could replace Facebook a few months later.,BitcoinThoughts,cigrvf3,4,t5_32213

1506686,0,t1_cj54jxj,gt Any other valid theory would have to explain both the previous bubbles and why the lower boundary is approaching fast explained with the same facts.Ok heres my theory the previous  bubbles occurred because Bitcoin has still not reached its full potential but a myriad of factors caused it to be brought into the press spotlight and brought new waves of speculators and capital.The timing of these past  bubbles was never due to a day cycle except perhaps through coincidence and proclaiming that an inviolable pattern had been established when in reality there were  data points to go off i.e. not enough for a pattern was a bit... hasty.The lower boundary is imaginary and nothing has inherently changed about the fundamentals of Bitcoin the blockchain still does what the blockchain does and it does it fine. If anything the public is now primed a little better to take this asset seriously so the fundamentals have improved in terms of mass psychological perception.Someone made a great point cant remember who that as systems growexpand in scope subsequent developments take longer to implement. It makes logical sense for this cycle to stretch out a bit if you take that into consideration.,BitcoinThoughts,cj54zai,11,t5_32213
1508737,0,t1_cj5bre1,As a usable currency bitcoin has a long way to go and I dont think it will ever replace FIAT.As a store of value and a payment network it shines and I believe people need to focus on providing services around those two major features over the currency feature.I use.BTC and LTC as a store of value for my disposable income I move it to VoS well leave a portion of my monthly buy ins there move the rest to offline wallets and sell it to FIAT as I need it I then transfer the FIAT to Credit card.From the sell to fiat on the card it takes a few hours turn around so I dont feel that my money is inaccessible. Also that entire transaction is offchain from my understanding. Only my deposit and withdrawal to cold storage would show up on the Blockchain.Look to the darknet markets for a solid indicator on how the technology is performing in the field. It appears the technology is robust enough to not only allow them to exist but thrive.They are also the first to implement many of the feature sets of the bitcoin protocol in one of most hostile business environment. Multi signature escrow is starting to take over  saw something about an older market rolling out upgrades to make it easy for the users to use multisig over centralized escrow. That will trickle out if its successful to the main stream commerce its too damn useful and enables people to set up their own structures.I also think a lot of the darknet market volume is staying off chain as much as possible. That would affect transaction volume and everyone out there has improved their infrastructure to account for SRsheepfucker events.Its gotten to the level that individual vendors are launching their own private markets....sounds a lot like what happen with Torrents.edit autocorrect mistakes.,BitcoinThoughts,cj5e8x6,1,t5_32213
