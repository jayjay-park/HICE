3969929,0,t3_35x1jw,I sometimes get the idea that The Escapist has a laissezfaire approach to reviews where they just let the staff review what they feel like rather than the usual game is coming out must review that many of the larger sites take.  Considering how few nonniche sites review games like SR I cant say that displeases me.,starruler,cr8szqw,1,t5_2sx5i

6251603,0,t3_412bsb,The game needed some mechanic to prevent one species from going Im going to live in the deepness of space good luck finding me.Besides in this game money roughly translates to resources. You build ships out of pure money thus the money is representing all the raw metals and electronic components that go into a ship. How is a ship floating in the void of space generating new resources?If you want a homeworld style game check out Nomad Fleet. Its basically homeworld but cut up into minute miniencounters.,starruler,cz08nfp,1,t5_2sx5i

Slowly upgrading each planet to gaia and waiting for your doom fleet to finish mopping up the other guy or the science victory to complete. Either way it becomes boring.SRs endgame usually still has me struggling to protect my supply lines as losing  food planets can cause a huge negative impact to my empire as planet after planet loses development levels it cascades upwards.,starruler,d27f5ni,1,t5_2sx5i
7618411,0,t1_d37urxg,Yup. Bugs me that the planet cannon isnt available as a researchable tech. I miss reshaping the whole galaxy to my whims in Space Empires.,starruler,d3869m0,1,t5_2sx5i
