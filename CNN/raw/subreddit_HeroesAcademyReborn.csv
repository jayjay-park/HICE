7187852,0,t3_49an3b,Blythe HopfootThirteenLawfulMain Power is Bunny summoning. He can summon up to twenty bunny rabbits all named all different colours to do his joyful bidding. The Bunnies are immortal they can be killed but they just vanish back to their original bunny place. And can be summon again thirty minutes later after theyve had some food.As you can tell the Bunnies cant really do a whole lot.The minor power is fluffiness enhancement. Both in terms of people animals and overall fuzzy wuzzy feelings. Soft things become softer happy people become happier. The bunny rabbits become even mroe adorable and cute and cuddly. Weaknesses includes lactose intolerance and a strong stubbornness to not eat meat. Hes also pretty weak so a single punch could probably knock him flat. Also since his rabbits come from another place any disruption to connections to other realities dimensions etc will make him unable to summon the bunnies.The drawbacks to using his powers is that hes almost immediately overcome by the adorableness of his bunny rabbits and tends to focus on cuddling them. Too much bunny summoning can tire him out fast so he tends to only get a few at a time. And of course... The bunnies cant really fight.Blythe is a happy guy always with a bright spark of life in his heart. He wears glasses and tends to dress smart. His mother is an artist and his dad writes kids shows for TV Networks. As such hes always been in a happy home and rarely complains. His sisters are back in Anchor city much older than he is. He looks to them as his idols. A lot of love is within his family. As such Blythe is also from Anchor City.And nope first character.,HeroesAcademyReborn,d1v73ub,1,t5_3d0v5
