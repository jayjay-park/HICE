10577497,0,t3_5re3c1,This sub may be dead in favor of the hive mind having formed on the forums but are those forums ever entertaining right now.  Especially when the selfappointed guardian of the comics direction and content dictator of unofficial encyclopedic material sentry gun against criticism and overall IRL clone of Xanthe completely loses it over the authors use of underage characters in the comic. Underage characters that should have been innocent and naive unaware of the issues at hand.  Characters which in their opinion should have been replaced with adult characters for exact the same impact.  After years of defending the comic as being just a comic on one hand and interpreting it as literal commentary on societal issues on the other to the extent that one inanimate object is actually a proxy for an idea while the other should be treated as though it was a person depending on which interpretation fits their internal narrative externalized on the other hand it appears theres a third hand required.  Hopefully theyll find it.. its probably the one thats jackhammering the question mark key.Though I dont mind the direction the comic has taken shaking those forums around  even though unintentional  was long overdue.  Now to see if down the road this will push the author to take another extreme in a direction change as they come to another realization using underage characters in a comic regardless of their purpose therein is exploitative.  At least thus suggests the forum.,sinfest,dd6zinq,1,t5_2qntg
