3704782,0,t1_cqe12fm,I havent yet attempted any of the ones you guys have mentioned...too difficult for a new canyoneer. But Im getting better and Garden Creek and possibly Englestead are on my list for this fall. I have to find some other canyoneers with whom to do Ice CubeThe Maze Illusions wonder how it is after last years fire?? and Heaps...those seem to be bad choices for a party of two. Jump Canyon also sounds amazing! Next year a California canyoneering trip is definitely in order.My favorite canyon so far is Bear Canyon in West Clear Creek. Easy and so beautiful. But all the ones you both listed sound even better,canyoneering,cqekj2v,1,t5_2sbhe

5259775,0,t1_cvjuxos,Fair and I agree that more access to education and training is a good thing luckily the U.S. does seem to be getting more canyoneering courses lately and wasnt meaning to come across as rude. I completely understand how anyone who doesnt canyoneer would think more restrictive permits could help...only when youve seen the huge variability in conditions and all the ways you can die for yourself is it really possible to understand just how much personal judgment and responsibility is needed to visit canyons.,canyoneering,cvjztbz,1,t5_2sbhe
5301466,0,t1_cvp2hgx,Im a big fan of the pvc rope bag for this reason when I throw that thing down it makes a loud satisfying THUD when it his the ground.  If I cant see the bottom at least I can hear it.I think another lesson here might be that canyons are dynamic places and change all the time.  Just because youve done it before doesnt mean its going to be the same next time.  Also static ropes change in length over their lifespan they get shorter.,canyoneering,cvpbnya,3,t5_2sbhe
