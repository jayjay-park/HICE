2415026,0,t3_2m306d,While I was on a business trip I had a lot of free time and paper. I feel as I should give some background but also his role in the whole thing in order to fully understand him. Carlos Reyes. Forensic department. Comicrelief. background character actually the killer  Id like your Bio for Detective James to be put on Carlos. As Carlos actually DID kill his parentsaccidentallyand the thrill of almost being caught but being let off clean gave him a feeling of euphoria that he wants to repeat over and over again. Killing isnt enough for him. Someone has to be near to catching him so he can get away in order for him to get that feeling he craves.The character himself will be portrayed as full of energy charismatic and a bit of a dreamer. A common motif is people in the station constantly telling him to stop tapping his pencil or his foot.   This is to create a dramatic contrast for the confrontation. When its revealed that its him the detective will notice the glow in his eyes has dulled. and hes sittingstanding still for once.In the end hes realized that his game has gone on for too long. hes not getting the feeling anymore. he walks up to a surface  and with the blood of the detective leaves his own fingerprint at the scene and walks away walks up to the camera and puts a print on it. Since the recurring theme was that he kills the person whos print is at the scene it leaves a question hanging in the air. Is he allowing himself to be caught? Is he killing himself?Sorry if this is all a bit jumbled. Im doing three things at once and I just want to get it all jotted down.thoughts?,RedditMadeThisMovie,cma7fj9,1,t5_32ao7
