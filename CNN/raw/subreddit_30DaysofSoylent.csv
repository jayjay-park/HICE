10242642,0,t3_5ml4ia,Had first solid food in two days today wow. That made me feel very uncomfortable. Went to a mexican restaurant with family. The first few bites were like wow this tastes totally AMAZING and then about three bites later I was thinking Im totally going to throw this up... I only made it about  through my meal and took home the rest in a togo container. Probably wont eat it. Luckily did not need to throw up but felt nauseous for about an hour after eating. Was feeling full and bloated all day like I had stretched out my stomach. Finally felt a little hungry to start a bottle of . for late dinner a few minutes ago but dont think Ill even drink all of it tonight. Have lunch planned with a friend tomorrow going to adjust my expectations for how much I order to eat I think.I had a  mile run scheduled this morning but skipped it because it was F with wind chill of F... decided to stay in my nice warm bed an extra hour instead. Planning on hitting up the gym tomorrow evening.,30DaysofSoylent,dc526od,1,t5_3i6dw
10317708,0,t3_5nql5t,Ive been following this subreddit since the start and while I didnt think about committing to a full  days of Soylent Ive had one or two bottles for... About  weeks now. So I guess I might be part of the  days challenge in a minor way. I do enjoy reading the daily threads and have always found easy meal replacements to be pretty interesting. Ive slowly been working on losing a couple pounds but havent focused myself too much on it. ,30DaysofSoylent,dcdkgos,1,t5_3i6dw
