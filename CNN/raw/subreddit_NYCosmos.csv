10977977,0,t1_decalgx,Man you are obsessed.  Seriously get a life troll.BKtoDuval why would folks west of the Hudson pay an  toll.  This from a guy who has stated others dont know about NYC but clearly he does more than anyone.  Lol.  George Washington Bridge cars . for cash . peak with EZPass . offpeak with EZPass . when carpooling with  people or more with NY and NJ EZPass only.  NJT bus to NYC GWB Bus Station or Port Authority Bus Terminal . to . between Zone  and Zone .  PATH train . to Herald Sq connecting to NYC Subway A or  train at Penn Station ..  But why should I even answer any questions from a troll? What a waste of time to talk to someone who has just called the Cosmos a minor league team.  Adios troll.,NYCosmos,decbt8c,1,t5_2ui1g
