It looks particularly monolithic in this picture but in other pictures such as this one  its actually made up of smaller albeit still monotithic concrete blocks. Also brutalist indicates to me small windows. The picture displays quite large windowsThe architect Alejandro Aravena was awarded the Pritzker Prize for his works including this building. The wooden interior is quite nice because of how warm and open it is which contrasts with the cold and closed exterior. see  and Brutalists buildings besides small windows are also known for horrible complex interior circulation meaning it is easy to get lost inside the building.

The reason for this is that there are predominantly Maori communities and rural areas that struggle to get the likes of doctorsdentists etc into their communities. By allowing Maori to study without cost means these communities can benefit.The US is similar but also owe a debt to African Americans for their decades of doing everything they can to stop them getting ahead.

11648574,0,t1_dggb5tq,well obama has a passport and a drivers license so hes shown his birth certificate to govt offices. so hes obviously proven that he has one. Is there a law that you need to show the birth certificate to run for office? Because no one ever brought it up. Id be fine with it if there was one. But this is the first time in Presidential history to my knowledge that someone made such a stink of it and it also correlates to the first time anyone of color held the office. Is that coincidence? I really doubt it. But the guy I was arguing with earlier talked about it being really suspect when we all know it wasnt.on the taxes... people can change their minds sure. But theres no evidence that he changed his mind. He just changed what he told people.  of people want to see his taxes. That means at least half of the people that voted for him want to see his taxes. They trusted him when he said that he would and the continued to do so when he moved the goal posts. I think he never had any intention of showing his taxes bc it would be a deal breaker. We will find out later when Comey comes to town again. If there is something explosive in this financial records then he had no intention of ever showing them to anyone.,evilbuildings,dggdorp,3,t5_3ckh2

11738681,0,t1_dgqi0hg,I find that its fairly often not sound. Apologies for the wall of text but one brief example Im familiar with so you can see what I meanConsider their page on Holocaust victims. I dont think its an academic distinction to state that the Holocaust very specifically refers to the destruction of European Jewry by Nazi Germany. This is partially acknowledged since the text under scope reads the term Holocaust generally refers to the systematic mass murder of the Jewish people in Nazioccupied Europe. But it goes on to add nonJews anyways without ever justifying that decision. So that total is awkwardly raised from . million to  million. Of course one can point out that this number is created in an arbitrary way. Being more inclusive this number can rise to  million or more. But this is a giant confused mess that has nothing to do with what the Holocaust was. According to the Historian Yehuda Bauer and unstated by the Wikipedia article the number of  million came from Eli Wiesel who knowingly misled people to raise awareness of the nonJewish victims of the Nazis. Wikipedia here is acting as a source to promote an intentional distortion by the unwitting. The way people use and interpret this number is interesting. Racists like it because they can argue that the Nazis did not specifically target the Jews antiracists like it because its more inclusive and doesnt priviledge one race Polish nationalists like it because it contributes to the national selfpitying Croats like it because it detracts responsibility away from their seperate genocide of Serbs and yet others like it because they think evil is proportional to the death count. But for anyone who is familiar with Holocaust history the whole picture of intentionality is lost. Wikipedia is full of things like this. Selective narratives confused notions halftruths myths etc.gt but a quick google of Kozieroks st law just links to a wikipedia conspiracy site so Id take that with a pinch of salt.Well I did qualify it as  supposed and one of the multitude of questionable and mysterious origined internet laws. Ive seen people use it before. I dunno if theyre conspiracy theorists or not though.gt I wouldnt call it cheap authority just because it is accessible.By cheap I mean its of low quality.gt People using it relentlessly to win internet arguments are usually the sort that hold entrenched views that wont be budged anyway and therefore they will just go to wikipedia to back up their facts and take things out of context in which case the problem more than likely lies with the person as opposed to wikipedia. Right. All Im suggesting is that its a fairly good heuristic to figuring out who to ban. Like if someone begins their response by pointing out  different socalled logical fallacies. Theyre probably the obnoxiously uncharitable kind who view everything as a debate. I mean all of this in a halfjoking manner of course but having to deconstruct a Wikipedia article that someone is using a proxy is tedious and a gigantic drag.,evilbuildings,dgqly84,1,t5_3ckh2
