You definitely see the worst of our fan base. The LA fans of old that only go to one game a year and let the wheels fly off.  That being said Ive also had some Bolts fans be super shitty to me while in San Diego for nothing more than wearing Silver and Black. Both teams have some low life shit fans and we always think your own shit stinks less.Good luck in the playoffs..

548104,0,t3_20exzq,How bout the fair argument that Talib and probably Verner i havent seen his contract deets cost  FREAKING MILLION A YEAR ON A  YEAR CONTRACT......We had about  to spend for the entire period of free agency.  Defensive players have the tendency to chase the money over everything else where youll see some offensive guys go where they can get the most recognition.  We dont have the money for the top defensive guys so they dont want to come here its as simple as that.Also look at the guys were signing none of them have been more than backups last year who have ptoential to come in and contribute for us.  Kavell Conner Donald Brown Ghee were all backups who have something to prove and the potential to be starters maybe not Conner.Also ive wanted to add this for a while.  But I find it very strange that our name has been thrown in the ring for so many star WRs yet at least from what ive heard it doesnt seem like we have any interest in signing big name FAs.  It really just looks like theyre listing us as a place they want to go but we dont have much interest in them coming here.Its been the strategy of TT and McCoy all along to build this team through the draft and i have no doubts thats what were going to do.  Id be willing to bet that especially if we sign a WR like Nicks at least  of the first  or  picks will be on defense whether it be pass rusher CB or NT.,Chargers,cg2kqma,0,t5_2rzkb

3147043,0,t1_coo61db,I didnt say itd be easy or even smart. We all know theres tons of problems even without the stadium mess. But an NFL team puts you on the map. Makes you relevant. But it is also a luxury. One we probably cant afford. So I dont know what to say man. I want to keep our team more than any of those things you listed. But Im in the minority at this point. The city has messed this up for  years now. Only now that the Chargers get insistent do we blame them for pushing the issue to an uncomfortable spot. Doesnt seem fair to blame the team when they could go anywhere and get their demands met because having a team means getting your way. Its the ultimate luxury but it has significant value. Whether or not we like it the Chargers can pick a bunch of cities and ask for the same thing. Theres plenty of hungry cities looking to step up to the big league and be represented. Few have the cash to pull it off but as a business the NFL can push all the buttons and get their way. If we cant afford it we shouldnt be attacking the Chargers because theyve run out of patience after  years.What I said and continue to say is simply this. Its a choice we have to make whether we want to be a big city or a town. Were going to lose money on the deal either way. The choice is the citys to make. But Id throw most of SDs finances under the bus to keep the team where it belongs. Im hardly fair about it and whether or not its right to do thats how I feel. ,Chargers,coo6rkn,4,t5_2rzkb

3182137,0,t1_cort3kp,Not sure if reddit ate my reply so Im trying again.Thats a valid question. If youre interested in learning more this book is hugely interesting.Two examples from the book one from page gt ... the financial plan may attribute some sales income and property taxes offsite to the existence of the facility. This type of revenue is called tax increment financing and was used in San Francisco to generate a financial plan for the new ers facility that shows no net expected cost to the city.This is the basis of my argument for less direct financing. Stadium proponents will claim that there are economic benefits and there are undoubtedly some although relatively minisicule compared to the costs and therefore it makes sense to me for the incentives and financial inputs to be tied to those supposed benefits.Another relevant partgt Arrangements are generally regarded as public if the facility is paid for and managed by the local government authority and any deficit is covered by that government... ie. the renovations of the Oakland Coliseum... and the construction of the new stadium in St. Louis. By contrast when direct construction costs are paid by the team the financing is considered private. Examples in this category are the new football stadium for the... Carolina Panthers and the new baseball stadium in San Francisco for the Giants.The book goes on to say that this distinction doesnt cover all the intricacies of the deal which is true. However with the rise of private revenue streams from sports teams ballooning over the last  years it stands to reason that those same private organizations should bear a larger financial burden or to put it another way the city should not subsidize the operations of the team to as large of an extent.,Chargers,cortta3,1,t5_2rzkb

He was very very good in pass pro and run blocking plus he has the versatility to play any of the interior line spots which gives us a lot of freedom in the draft Watt was the best center all year after Hardwick got hurt and the best guard period.,Chargers,cos70x3,5,t5_2rzkb

3808657,0,t1_cqq0xu5,So you expect the team to plop a stadium in a town with crumbling infrastructure with no help from the city? A major city like us should be able to handle fixing streets and keeping sports teams. With the timing of the recession and the age of Qualcomm showing we should have gotten this done a long time ago and we shouldve done it down town. Now were up against a time crunch as the chargers market is being saturated and Qualcomm NEEDS to be rebuilt. We also need to worry about losing ComicCon but that is something Reddit will get behind but a  year relationship with the chargers they throw in the toilet. I mean look at the decisions this city is making. Look at all the money that went to that gaudy library and the bridge OVER the . No dont worry about the fact that the th largest city in the US has a highway from the s that hasnt been updated as a main lifeline. It takes HOURS to leave a Qualcomm game or a major Padres game. That is in the city. The trolley sucks and should go to the airport but the city wants to plan a observation tower and kick out the chargers? Dean spanos is making a business decision for a private business. The city is dicking around pointing fingers while we lose a great team. Also what is the citys great idea with what to do with the Aztecs? What do we do about the Qualcomm site with no help from chargers? Urban sprawl is probably the answer and Aztecs continue to be laughed at by top recruits because their high school in Texas had a better stadium. Wouldnt it be ideal to have an Aztec football team to match or top level basketball team? Wouldnt it be better for us if the rolling stones or Paul McCartney sold out a brand new  thousand seat stadium instead of half that in petco?

5080299,0,t3_3kkt78, The Chargers manage to get  sacks and  pressures on Matt Stafford wreaking havoc on an offensive line sorely missing Larry Warford and hold the Lions to  scores one coming in garbage time and  field goals. The Chargers manage to over come the obstacles the Lions defense puts before them particularly Danny Woodhead and Stevie Johnson who each score a touchdown. While the DET defense proves stout against the run Branden Oliver manages to squeak in with a red zone TD run in the rd quarter. Josh Lambo goes  in field goals to seal the game   . The Chargers are unable to register more than  sack on Stafford less than a hand full of pressures and Golden Tate runs circles around Branden Flowers going for over yds receiving and  TDs. Though Megatron has a relatively quiet day hes able to score one late in the game and the Lions clock out the Chargers in the second half behind a trio of successful drives engineered by the run game. The Chargers meanwhile struggle to get a running game open Josh Lambo misses a pair of field goals in his debut and a couple of timely interceptions from Grover Quin and James Ihedigbo are enough to stymie the Chargers offense to the tune of a    defeat. ,Chargers,cuyd9wm,1,t5_2rzkb

5362375,0,t3_3ognd6,Chargers offense is like the hardest thing to predict. Phil spreads the ball too much to know who is gonna blow up. Once he finds a weakness he picks on it. If a corner is playing like ass hell target Keenan  times. If a lb sucks at covering out of the backfield Woodhead will put up points. To want to know who is gonna blow up just look at the Steelers D. Who are they missing? What are they good at? Shaziers missing so can their lbs cover? How good is their seconday at covering TEs? Tldr You cant play studs from the chargers like you would other teams because Phil will exploit whatever matchup is available instead of force feeding a superstari.e AB.

But its totally unfair to judge Melvin Gordon this year due to the WHOLE fucking offensive line being injured. How can you expect any running back to put up good numbers when the whole oline is full of backups? The blocking is beyond bad  its horrendous.Is it the GMs fault that guys keep getting injured? I think it is somewhat because the Chargers scouts should know if certain guys have been prone to injuries throughout their college careers and that needs to be taken into account.

That said these things provide a huge service to society. They create what we call solidarity. This used to be done by religion and monarchs and stuff like that we had solidarity due to similarities. This is what Durkheim calls mechanical solidarity. Nowadays we are no longer similar. We are all professionals in completely different fields thanks to the division of labour. We believe in different things. We act in different ways. We live in different places etc etc etc.So now we need each other in order to survive. The farmer that only raises pigs needs the plumber to service his house etc. We have solidarity through this.However we need group feelings too solidarity isnt just needing each other it is also a feeling of being in a group. Sport events religion all these things create this. National holidays any event with many people involved and a shared focus of attention does this.,Chargers,cyynhwk,20,t5_2rzkb

Itll make him marginally stronger but hes so strong that it doesnt matter if he adds a little more strength if it comes through sacrificing burst.I think Bosa is a great fit for a certain type of .  As an OLB im really just not a fan.  Hed have to play that Paul KrugerJarrett JohnsonPernell McPhee role and that limits him more than playing  DE does.  I think if he ends up playing in a Lebeau or Fangiolike  he could be Justin Smith reimagined as a  Technique.  a position that doesnt have to take up blocks like most i or  Techniques but has to be incredibly strong powerful and pretty athletic to play  gaps vs the run head on vs an OT.  Hes got that perfect combination adding just a little bit of weight would help him a bit but his play style and skillset is ready made for that position in the NFL.  Again hes not going to succeed if you put him as a normal  DE where hes  gapping every play you have to be creative with him if you dont play a traditional  and play him more like the role that Michael Bennett plays in Seattles  Under or play him like Justin Smith in San Fransisco.Honestly hes the guy Im leaning towards as the favorite for .  Hes a good mix of upside and a safe pick of the DL that could be worth the  pick Nkemdiche on the side of Upside and Buckner on the side of Pro ready without a ton of upside.Honestly this seems like a draft where were going to see someone unexpectedly drop and I think this is the perfect draft to move back up and grab the guy who ends up falling towards the end of the first.,Chargers,d09hg0s,1,t5_2rzkb

If Teo cant make the tackle on the nd level that leaves Ramsey to be looking like Weddle when the RBs go to break tackles on him too. We need fast athletic guys up front and in the flanks who can finish. If we want a safety that bad we can place Jack there and if Teo doesnt show improvement his final year of the contract we already have his replacement and can look for more of a pure safety while we switch Jack to ILB. ,Chargers,d13whdr,1,t5_2rzkb

7084978,0,t1_d1jbssi,The reason that Bolt referred to him as a run and chase LB is that he isnt great at playing the run from a read and react standpoint.  He seems to have trouble diagnosing run plays in front of him and reacting accordingly and often relies on his speed and ability to cover a lot of ground to try to make up for deficient instincts.  For that reason some scouts feel he is best suited as a weak side LB where he can use his speed to chase the play from the back side.  If he plays safety he is still going to need to diagnose runpass and react accordingly which seems like it is not his strength.  Here is an example of a scouting report supporting what I said aboveBeyond that while has has sometimes been asked to cover slot receivers he didnt play safety in college.

7109513,0,t1_d1m7uh2,Let me count the ways. Traded away a th round pick to move up into the nd round and draft Manti Teo a linebacker whose frequent injury status incapacity for finishing tackles solo and propensity for being pushed around by blocking running backs when blitzing has a ceiling of Donnie Edwards not borderline RD talent. Theres a reason why Denzel Perryman was drafted because Teo nor Telescos biggest FA swingandmiss Donald Butler has not panned out. He is a replacement level linebacker at best.. Drafting Chris Watt in the third round. Watt has not proven himself to be an startingcaliber center in the NFL even when healthy see the New England game from two seasons ago where he was abused nor the kind of replacement for Nick Hardwick that Philip Rivers desperately needs to play up to the MVPlevel he displayed in . When you trade away as many draft picks as Telesco has you need your third rounders to turn into NFL starters. Watt however is a backup guardcenter at best.. Drafting Craig Mager. Just... Why? Why? Magers not even an excellent RDgrade guy who happen to fall in the rd. And we were and kind of are since we didnt exactly let Mager take Robinsons spot we spent  on Heyward loaded on defensive back talent! Hes Cornerback Jonas Mouton a small school guy Telesco took because hes trying to outsmart the rest of the league but instead wasted a rd round pick on a guy who probably wont likely ever play better than Marcus fucking Gilchrist. That with Henry Anderson arguably a DPOY candidate before being injured sitting right there to draft for a defensive line that has been criminally neglected until and debatably through this offseason. Especially given what occurred before it. The Melvin Gordon disaster.  picks.  marginal talent. For a team that continues to suffer injuryriddled season after injuryriddled season you had better make damn sure that the guy you sacrifice  picks for is going to be a transcendent talent. Melvin Gordon is not that. Melvin Gordon doesnt outright suck his inability to go down at first content more often than not is pretty much the only good thing about his game but it was debatable whether he was worth a late st round pick or even an early nd round pick. But th overall? What a nightmare. Gordons ceiling is pretty much Ryan Mathews and when you drafted him to replace Ryan Mathews at arguably a higher cost long term than just resigning Mathews and going RBBC with him Woodhead and Oliver and he winds up playing objectively worse than Donald Brown like... You couldnt have possibly dreamt up a worse gaffe.Also arguable are the following Trading away a th and moving up to draft Jerry Attaochu in the nd round of the  draft who unlike Manti Teo demonstrated increased production across the board and also developed into a halfdecent run stopper but stopped producing midway through the season and continues to have lingering injury questions. I like Jerry but I think a lot of what applies to Manti Teo applies to him. The inability to draft late round picks who contribute in key fashion. Unlike teams like the Seahawks that are adept at finding late round talent that can start the Chargers have no th round or later pick as a nottherebecauseweliterallyhavenooneelsetoplaythatposition starter. Not one. Brad Sorensen. Tourek Williams. Steve Williams. Ryan Carrethers. Marion Grice. Tevin Reese. Kyle Emmanuel. Darius Philon. Sure there are some things to like about those guys but none of them have come in and taken starting jobs. They are for the most part middling depth that hasnt done much. Arguably Telesco has done a better job looking for UDFA talent Oliver Addae Philips but that is probably because his late round picks have taken together generally speaking suuuuuuuucked. Drafting DJ Fluker as a franchise left tackle instead of passing on him because hes at best a decent starting guard. This is more about the strategy of using the th overall pick on a guard and whether that makes sense. Its a total organization failure that the team put him at tackle instead of guard from the get go so that we basically waste the last two years of his rookie deal trying to get him familiar with his position but its debatable whether he was the right guy at . Star Lotuleilei should have probably been the pick but I find this to be the least of Telescos many failings.,Chargers,d1m8s1m,2,t5_2rzkb

He has a house up in sunset hills he isnt doing this to protect the environment. Im sure somewhere lost in the shuffle is some type of pay for play game.Here is an article about the sleazy type of politics and power brokers hes playing with and the lawsuits he is launching from his nonexistent nonprofits with regards to the Port of San DiegoHere is an passage from the article gt From  to  Briggs filed  lawsuits on behalf of the coalition  three that dealt with the visionary plan. And while those cases worked their way through court he was also meeting with Cushman thenCouncilman Kevin Faulconer and port staff.gt There are no public records of what went on in those meetings no notes no calendar events no log of phone calls no draft plans and no emails between the parties involved.  gt What resulted from those discussions was a pivotal legal document signed by Briggs that enabled Cushman and the port to persuade the state to approve a North Embarcadero project that violated its master plan its own law.gt Briggs in his first and only interview with inewsource in February  said the legal agreement was a compromise reached before he lost a lawsuit over a park on the waterI know the Chargers have already met with this clown the fact that nothing has come out of that meeting is bad news bears.

8653471,0,t1_d6n2xq8,The DeMaio plan is pie in the sky.  Its a bunch of grand sweeping statements designed to build political capital by appealing to those of the mindset that a stadium should be  privately financed.  Unfortunately its full of ideas that are almost impossible to conceive of in any reality.  For example he expects to raise between M and .B by asking fans to buy into an ownership stake in the stadium which would essentially get them a specific seat and discounted access to nonfootball events.  Quick question if it was actually possible to raise .B out of the fans pockets why would they need a proposal this complex with other funding sources and why would the fans only get discounted access to events?  Why wouldnt those fans that collectively pay .B simply be organized into a coalition and become the actual owners of the stadium rather than just folks with access to discounted event prices?  M of that is expected to come from people buying standing room only access for anywhere from k to k per share!!  So you are telling me that if I want to have season tickets to the Chargers for my family of four I have to pony up k to k for standing room only access?  How many lifetimes of discounted concerts would I have to attend to make that pay off?  He also has hundreds of millions coming from various development partners none of whom have actually been identified or signed on yet which makes that nothing more than excessively optimistic speculation.  There are other issues as well. For all the criticism of the downtown stadium proposal it is light years ahead of this one in terms of specifics and transparency.,Chargers,d6naql4,2,t5_2rzkb

8728162,0,t1_d6wf92v,The thing that is so stupid is that if the deal doesnt get signed nobody wins. EVERYONE loses. Joey Bosa misses a year doesnt get paid probably gets drafted at a lower position which gives him less money and has to wait an additional year for free agency which is where he earns the big bucks.The chargers lose the rd overall pick they look like a big joke for not being able to sign a pick after the CBA and its not going to help them get votes for a new stadium.The agents lose because they couldnt negotiate this deal. If there is no deal they do not get paid. There are many players who are on the chargers side and think its ridiculous that the agents have brought it to this point. Players are probably going to be thinking about this when making a decision on an agent.The fans lose because bosa was supposed to be a pivotal part of this defense. I think the chargers could still be decent but the defense could be much better with bosa than without or else we wouldnt have drafted him. This is like the prisoners dilemma. If both sides work together to make it work all sides can get something out of it. Instead because both sides are trying to get a little more everyone loses. Both sides are trying to win instead of working together to get a positive outcome not necessarily a win for everyone.,Chargers,d6wnwam,7,t5_2rzkb

What leader wouldnt say something like this?On a more serious note the Chargers do have a chance at winning this division.Many predictions that are currently out assume that the team will just suck. Many forget that the oline was decimated making this offense very onedimensional. The defense also lacked a pass rush. The secondary had some health issues as well making it difficult to keep any kind of lead.Melvin Ingram is bound to break out as the defensive front had matured. He had . sacks last season and will likely surpass that number in .Philip Rivers is arguably the best QB in this division. Only reason anybody would put Alex Smith ahead of him is because they forget that the Chiefs have a very good running game keeping defenses on their toes.I can keep going and going about this but I do believe PR has plenty of reasons to believe why the Chargers may be the team to beat in the AFC West.Also usupercharged should start becoming part of the community before the SDBR links get banned.,Chargers,d6y1vfp,1,t5_2rzkb

9034651,0,t1_d7xauhx,Yeah this is pretty much what Id go with.  We pretty much have the same guys on our team meaning that if theyve had injury concerns before theyre probably going to have some sort of similar injury concerns again one of the biggest factors of predicting injury to certain areas of the body is previous injury history of that area.Ive actually noticed a significantly better track record this year than the last few years in terms of the smaller naggingday to day injuries musculartendon injuries mostly which leads me to believe that they put a better system in place for recovery and performance this year than they had in the past.  Its again part of the reason why I really liked Chip Kelly.  He puts a huge emphasis on the smaller things that make a big difference.  He has guys run tests to figure out what specifically you sweat out and lose during practice or figuring out the latest research on warm upcool down techniques.  Theres a reason his team was top  in injuries or adjusted injuries in terms of player importance since hes been a head coach.  He puts together programs and uses experts in the field to reduce the muscular fatigue which also leads to musculartendon injury and that has a pretty big effect on some of the major injuries.  Youre not going to stop a few major injuries from happening but controlling the fatigue and smaller injuries that players feel is paramount.,Chargers,d7xtlmr,1,t5_2rzkb

9070699,0,t1_d824ids,Stevie Johnson went down like the first week of training camp and didnt get replaced on the roster for like  weeks not until AFTER KA went down.  He had a long while of knowing that it was KA Benjamin and special teamers and despite Benjamins size and KAs injury history he didnt think he needed to add to that group.And look how its played out Benjamin has played pretty well but is still clearly a .  Inman has more or less been a ghost.  Williams is getting nice chunks but not a lot of catches and pretty much is only able to run a single play the rub route crossing pattern  that should be pretty alarming as the only time hes really able to create space is when we run a pick play for him.Its just just the top guys that he signs its who hes signs to replace them  in this case Dexter McCluster and Grif Whalen  and when   weeks after the first guy goes down  weeks after the second  that deserve the scrutinity.  Sure I dont expect him to sign Calvin Johnson out of retirement but hes got to make a deal with someone or pounce on the waiver wire which we should have a good placement on that can actually do something for us.,Chargers,d825gd7,1,t5_2rzkb

On top of that that would mean youd essentially have  LBs on base downs with Brown Perryman and Toomer as of right now and Id personally rather have Phillips back as deep safety over Lowery other than when he gave up that TD to Cooper where he was in man coverage for some reason Phillips has not been the weakness of the secondary and really having Phillips on man against Cooper shouldnt have happened.gtAnyway I think it would be really interesting to see us with a  man front and  linebackers.That front  would be even more of a liability against the pass than the current front  in base package is.

Do the research many SD residents cross the border to see them play almost every weekend that the games are available during the season. Major Mexican televison stations already have the SD market. If you guy dont already know that.  Earnings? in a city full of transplants. Thats a fools way of thinking. Thats the exact same thing that happened to us. Apart from the losing SD market was never well established. Thus it is small especially with transplants that sought the team as a luxury to keep it there. Apart from Spanos greedy ways NO private funding was introduced and thats why there was a small market  Yes I understand breaking the business stand point. More money etc. But youre not going to make or at least attempt change fans ways like it never happened with the Chargers.  MLS will never top the quality of play like liga MX or central or south american leagues. Thats a fact.I know moving changing and leaving SD will tarnish Chargers legacy with those very loyal fans. Yes it will hurt them for some while. But if youre a real fan will support the the team regardless of where they go that why you become a fan in the first place. And if you doubt yourself you were never a fan.

11783775,0,t1_dgvob0n,Right my point in this is saying that he is fast enough. He doesnt have incredible speed but .. still falls in the range of I believe the technical term is pretty fast. Id hate on this pick if he ran a . but hes not slow.,Chargers,dgvq9hl,1,t5_2rzkb
11784501,0,t1_dgvsyub,gt we never seem to sign or draft players with any type of concern or character issueThat was with the old coaching staff. The fact that we have shown interest in Joe Mixon and still have him on our draft board tells me that that isnt the case anymore or at least to some extent. McDowells character issues are nowhere near the magnitude of Mixons.gtMcDowell is a top  pick if it wasnt for his effort and character.Saying he is top  is largely underselling him.,Chargers,dgvt8fu,2,t5_2rzkb
11784783,0,t1_dgvrkrc,I think some of it can be attributed to the game scenarios. A lot of the th qtr picks where when we were down and other teams knew we had to get aggressive and push the ball down field.
