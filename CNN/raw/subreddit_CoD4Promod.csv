6146414,0,t1_cyo92tc,You may be right but without trying well never know. I know that currently as of now there are roughly  players playing CoD online now thats almost  times more than DirtyBomb even  years after release and several hundred to over a thousand playing CSGO because theres no other choice and the same amount not playing anything but casual games for fun for the same reason.I see DirtyBomb is only available through steam and is made by the Nexon company who focus on various different titles and didnt heavily push this game as much as they needed to. Theres no incentive to play other than for fun. If CSGO was only for fun and there were no skins ranking or pro scene with cash there would be little incentive and numbers would have begun declining already. The same can be said for Dota which had a much smaller scene back in the day with declining numbers. Its only with the current system in place and changes that games like MOBA or FPS titles can grow through incentives. I work within business and marketing so Im not completely clueless on what Im trying to achieve I do have some form of credentials that back up what Im trying to achieve.If a mix of the players still playing the ones who miss it and with some marketing a few new players are introduced a few thousand is all it needs to get something started. From there we look for growth.In the end without an attempt like this the game is going to die regardless so doing something like this doesnt hurt anyone and at least allows people like me who loved competing in the CoD series see if theres any potential for a comeback there or if players just cant be bothered to help see the game come back.,CoD4Promod,cyoa6rr,1,t5_2tl8w

It would span huge esports scene around cod.Why?Because cod with promod is the best as esports can get.,CoD4Promod,d6td423,1,t5_2tl8w
8957781,0,t1_d7jew9g,There are so many c insert player binds I remember even to this day. Just the usual binds in general. Even your name reminds me of the GET CODEHOOKD one so many players used to have. Shit someone with enough time on their hands should make a thread with all the really famousmemorable ones.
