503742,0,t3_1ztgcs,I gave a presentation in school that used time series analysis in order for a third party observer of a repeated game of rockpaperscissors to predict the next move. It turns out that with repeated play you can guess correctly over a third of the time.,GAMETHEORY,cfxj1p3,1,t5_2r59q

2670979,0,t3_2lxfmt,This shouldnt be a paradox and it can be  or  depending on what your looking for. If you are looking at a straight line from point to point then Pythagorean theory works and its . You are looking at distance from the top step to the bottom but not the total surface area of the steps. This would be if you where going to put a flat board over the steps.If you are looking for surface then its the length and hight added in their example . This is because each step length is just a fractions of its hight and length. If you could unfold the step its .A clear example is to take a piece of paper and fold it so its ripple like. If you measure it from one ripple to the other it will be shorter than the original peice pythagorean but the surface area is still the same as the original length.This is just someone who doesnt know the difference while giving the illusion that is looking for  different things are in conflict when one really doesnt exist. ,GAMETHEORY,cn77xfw,2,t5_2r59q
