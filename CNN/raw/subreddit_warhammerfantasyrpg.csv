6084694,0,t1_cyh2s8b,Ehhhh...I dont think were disagreeing here. I think the e fluff is very general too and doesnt emphasise the grim dark humour of the Old World. I think youre right the e splat books are a fantastic source for info especially the likes of Sigmars Heirs even the equipment book was great for adding extra background. The e book was loaded with lots of info which differed from the later stuff that tied in with the wargame but was noentheless great. ,warhammerfantasyrpg,cyh6m79,2,t5_2uga9
