2758592,0,t3_2rmgz2,This is an amazing question! But Im going to go ahead and chime my  cents in and say its a safe bet there will be SP mods but no MP mods. The game runs on Rage engine and its know for being mod friendly. Its the same engine thats been used since IV just with Improvements. However I fear that MP will be locked down because a lot of people forget GTAV does have microtransactions and characters are cloudhive based. Im on mobile at the moment but when I get home Ill edit this and add a couple more reassuring reasons. ,GTAV_Mods,cnhn38o,1,t5_35ows

3892661,0,t3_34vu0i,There absolutely needs to be a mod that takes the speed limit from cars. Youll notice when driving in firstperson that the speedometer only goes up to  unless you use franklins special ability then you can go the actual top speeds of the cars for a few seconds until it goes back down. I just want to be able to go really fast without using the special ability. Its kinda lame how you go on the freeway expecting to be able to really rev it up but you get trapped at  when the cars are supposed to be able to do like  mph!,GTAV_Mods,cqzzx3c,4,t5_35ows
3896218,0,t3_34vu0i,Removing distance limits or at least extending limits on guns. Assault rifles only work to a hundred feet or so then the bullets stop registering. If the game treated all the players bullets the way it treated sniper rifle bullets then that range could be extended to almost a km. Same with the cannons on military jetshelicopters you have to be really close in order for the shots to register whereas the missiles have a much longer range. Also kind of a pipe dream but it would be sweet to have bullet simulation like travel distance and drop. I think the game uses hitscan but maybe if all bullets were treated like much faster and smaller grenades eg. from a grenade launcher since apparently its possible to replace bullets with other objects,GTAV_Mods,cr0eirp,2,t5_35ows
3898062,0,t3_352w3c,Does Rockstar know people are doing that? Because if they do one has to wonder why they havent made it skippable in an update to remove the need. Plus to enable skipping those two other screens after it that it doesnt get rid of.,GTAV_Mods,cr0m2t0,3,t5_35ows

4552673,0,t3_3bv2dc,I have three ideas. At this point I have no idea how to mod so im hoping someone sith skills would be intrested to make these.. Cinematic camera for walking just like in cars. Would work nicely with autoaim.. Hud to display different kind of stats. Would be nice when youre playing hotseat with a friend and the game would display how many kills you get. Could show drivebys hit and runs knock outs etc..... I would give this ones name Paranoia. When you get to certain distance from npcs they stop what theyre doing and start looking at you. If you go away they start following. If you start running or get in a a car theyre coming to kill you.Btw if someone could give me links for some basic tutorials on how to start making mods I would appreciate it. I hope someone would do this mods but if not I could start looking myself.,GTAV_Mods,ct4hiyx,1,t5_35ows

5327115,0,t1_cvscpx3,My goal was to keep it realistic. If you stay off the throttle it drives just like any other car. From the wheelie mods Ive seen people are only increasing traction and power. When you increase traction the cars tend to flip sideways. Ive countered this by adjusting the suspension with a lower roll center and lowering the center of mass z. IMO I found a sweet spot that hides the traction gain. Also it barely does a wheelie. If you take it to the mod shop you can get a much bigger wheelie as shown. Aside from the massive power it drives similarly to stock.,GTAV_Mods,cvslmss,1,t5_35ows
