6501641,0,t3_44n56b,This episode is amazing Ive just looked it up on dailymotion this is the difference. I dont know why but these episodes are way better I think without all the fluff and more time spent in investigations it allows you to connect to whats going on so much better. I truly hope that the GAC looks at this and realises that going back to basics will keep the viewing figures up.,GhostAdventures,czrthee,5,t5_2s9x1
6900915,0,t3_4a8cxx,Not too bad of an episode. Seemed liked they spent a little more time on the investigation segment which is always good. I get burned out on the dramatizations.,GhostAdventures,d0yjcpu,6,t5_2s9x1
6905472,0,t3_4a8cxx,The atmosphere was set in really creepy with the Evps of Get out orange blood and the male voice. The dramatic recreations werent over the top too honestly I was creeped out even before the investigation! As for the investigation itself it was excellent actually! Id say that this episode is my favorite now. Some pretty good evidence like the scratch and the Evps. Is it me or the voice thats captured after Zak gets scratched says Black blood? Thatd be neat of they did. Zak mentioned the fact it was similar to Bobby Mackeys and I can kind of see that.Would love to investigate there.,GhostAdventures,d0z1ze2,2,t5_2s9x1

7192036,0,t3_43id5b,I had to turn it off. That phychic was horrible. I dont trust them and she was so over the top I couldnt take it. She was totally bull shitting. I dont like the show much anymore I think they focus too much on drama and trying to be creepy than the science if it,GhostAdventures,d1voaf1,1,t5_2s9x1

7406189,0,t1_d2jvw2y,Yeah Ive seen that. I wonder if it was to get views for the first episode. Disappointed this turned out to be false though thats always gonna stay in my mind as the show continues. I hope he elaborates on that too but its unlikely.,GhostAdventures,d2k1a4k,1,t5_2s9x1
7421266,0,t3_4f4okh,So I just watched that episode less than  minutes ago and came to this sub to see if there was a post on it.

9374285,0,t3_58ycja,My biggest question was why did the metal bar he was laying on go in the opposite direction when he got pulled seems like it would drag with him. If he pushed himself backwards that would explain the bar moving the way it did. Maybe Zak himself questioned if it was legit and told Jay hes on landscaping duties for now.,GhostAdventures,d9499ka,3,t5_2s9x1

9789107,0,t1_dajoiu6,The two in comparison do seem a little off all right I will agree on that. Ive never doubted the team to fake evidence and Ive watched them since day  so I wasnt actively trying to seek them out. This however stood out to me ,GhostAdventures,dajpxts,1,t5_2s9x1
9873121,0,t3_5godyu,To everyone I fear that people may not want to participate on the show after social media labels them as druggies. Yes the guy showed some weird symptoms but he did say that he wasnt diagnosed with bipolar but feels bipolar in the house. Even Zak says that the owner and girl acted totally different when they werent in the house. Please lets not label people as druggies or having a mental illnesses when it could be possession or being highly sensitive to the paranormal especially in a ghost show. ,GhostAdventures,dauhovi,2,t5_2s9x1

10228439,0,t3_5mecqg,Yep Ive seen this on twitter too. It seems like most of the fans on there dont even really enjoy the show as much as they enjoy how hot the guys are. And they spend their whole day tweeting to them and trying to get a reply. So annoying! I stay away from the GA twitter community.,GhostAdventures,dc3g8pa,10,t5_2s9x1

10517956,0,t1_dd045ik,Thats a good idea  I have checked You Tube and Daily but not a true torrent site. Thanks for the idea if anyone else has a link to the original  hour special that would be great its like my white whale . I have seen every episode including all the raw Bobby Mackeys public ghost hunt and the raw footage from there Goldfield Hotel public hunt  but this special still eludes me! ,GhostAdventures,dd0bo2h,1,t5_2s9x1
10720502,0,t1_ddjgloe,I tend to agree with you.  I love GA and still watch every episode.  Ive convinced myself that theyve faked at least two things   the falling birdcage in Riddle House season  and  a spirit box voice saying spirit as I recall from the Kansas City train depot episode not sure what season.  You can clearly see Aaron mouthing the word spirit as the spirit box goes off.Regardless I still love the show!,GhostAdventures,ddlqo2d,2,t5_2s9x1
