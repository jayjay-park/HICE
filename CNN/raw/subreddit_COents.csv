And I think it would be unreasonable or at least ridiculously unlikely for our state supreme court to take all the liberties of how the Federal government should be treating marijuana.Tho I dont agree with the argument that its a contradiction to have THC scheduled lower than cannabis.  I mean I agree that with what we know they should be on the same playing field mostly however we are learning that some of the cannabinoids like CBN just arent the greatest so I could understand a scheduling where THC itself was considered less problematic than cannabis as a whole.

The other day I went to The Clinic on a Saturday and grabbed their last  eighths of very expensive Grimace at about  am. So they wouldnt sell bud to the recreational user for the rest of the day but they had plenty of stock and selection for medical patients. Also you can only buy mg of edibles at a time for recreational which limits what you can have on the edibles side too.

482511,0,t3_1zmkua,What are marijuana concentrates?Marijuana concentrates are uh marijuana thats been concentrated from its original flower form.  Marijuana may be concentrated using a variety of different methods the most common being BHO Butane HoneyHash Oil dry ice hash and ice water hash.Whats the difference between these types of concentrates?How the THC and other cannabinoids is extracted.  Generally extractions are divided into two categories solventbased and solventless.  BHO would be an example of a solventbased extraction using butane a soluble liquid to extract out the cannabinoids.  Solventless extractions like dry ice and ice water hash typically employ things called bubble bags or screens with tiny holes to sift out most of the plant matter leaving just the potent cannabinoids.  Butane?!  That doesnt sound healthyButane is actually found in many food products anything that needs a long shelf life.  The average daily intake for a person is mg.  Even poorly purged concentrates tend to have less than mg of butane per gram of wax.Purged?  Whats that?Purging is the term for the process of removing the solvent during the extraction process.Wax shatter crumble...what do all these words mean?All those terms typically refer to a BHO extraction however minor adjustments along the extraction process may product a slightly different product.  Terms like wax shatter and crumble describe the consistency of the final product  wax resembles goopy ear wax shatter is a clearer substance that should shatter upon impact crumble is a lightly crumbly form of ear wax.  In my experience shatter is typically deemed the highest quality concentrate for dabbing.Why does everyone call it dabbing?Cuz a little dab will do ya.  Often a dabbing motion is also used while smoking the product.So how do you smoke it?Typically people consume wax one of two methods out of an oil rig or by using a vaporizer pen.  Vaporizer pensVaporizer pens are a convenient and discrete method of smoking concentrates.  They resemble ecigarettes and the vapor is mostly unscented or smells like pine trees allowing folks to consume marijuana without smelling like Cheech amp Chong.  Vaporizer pens typically consist of three parts a battery a heating chamber and a mouth piece.  The user places product in the heating chamber assembles the pen and then generally after depressing a button to start heating the heating element sucks through the pen and takes a hit.  Vaporizer pens tend to deliver milder hits than oil rigs milder both in the effects on the lungs and general high effects.  They can sometimes be wasteful of the wax tho burning only a small percentage placed in the heating chamber.  Some vaporizer pens such as the Atmos Raw are able to burn both flowers and concentrates.   There are also some disposable vaporizers available on the market.  These dont have any way to recharge the battery that heats up the heating element.Oil RigsOil rigs are basically the bongs of the wax world.  They can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes with the main difference from bongs being that the stem points straight up instead of at an angle like a bong stem would.  However some methods of percolation are more suited for concentrates such as the fritted disc  This is because wax smoking has substantially less residue than smoked flowers. Instead of a flower bowl like youd have on a bong an oil rig typically has a nail.  A nail looks remarkably like a nail and is slipped into the stem of the oil rig.  The nail is heated generally with a blow torch to redglowing heat or just under and the wax is dabbed on to the nail and the smoke is inhaled.  There are also certain products such as the wonder worm which may used to cheaply turn any bong into a vaporizer for marijuana concentrates.Ive heard of titanium and quartz nails whats the difference?Titanium nails typically heat up quicker and hold their heat for slightly longer.  But they also tend to be more expensive than quartz nails.  Both titanium and quartz can begin to flake over times especially if overheated and the dust from both is potentially carcinogenic.  It cant be that much of a risk tho both titanium and quartz dust are commonly found in makeup products.How much does everything cost?If you already have a bong you can find a way to turn that into a wax smoking apparatus for .  If you shop around you can probably find an oil rig for as cheap as  but they typically run for .  Vaporizer pens typically cost  but they may be found as cheap as .  Disposable pens are even cheaper.Wax itself can be as cheap as gram on the black market or with a medical marijuana card.  In the recreational market it may cost as much as gram with taxes.How can I get a lesson on smoking concentrates?The First Friday events are always a good option.  Illuzions Glass and Hemp Hoodlab both host events on the first Friday of each month that involve copious amounts of dabbing.rCLORADO also has regular meetups of friendly folks who are dab masters.What else can I add?,COents,cfv4541,7,t5_2sh6j

Something as simple as a craigslist search would tell you thats absolutely bullshit. On top of that I know the Stanley brothers cbd pioneers just opened up shop in colorado and have been hiring brand new  industry experience people graduating from the science programs here to work on their CBD programs. I think a lot of people are discouraged themselves and hate to see other people with more drive and passion than them.

There are some decent places on there for decent price as long as you are ok with sharing a common living area. Housing here is ridiculous.

6378090,0,t1_czelbbs,A passed and the only reports since have been the tax data and the negatives. A majority of localities in CO have banned Marijuana businesses and if the marijuana community does not turn out this election we could see several more local bans passed and down here in Pueblo that could really fuck a whole lot of people. The ballot effort here in Pueblo looking to ban marijuana businesses county wide will almost certainly be on the ballot this November. Elections historically go in cycles. We almost never see a Dem elected after a Dem had  full terms in the White House or viceverse. Meaning that our next POTUS is likely going to be the Republican Nominee. The Republican nominee will win because more conservatives turn out to vote which means that any and all repeal or ban efforts will also have more conservatives voting on those questions. The anti pot groups are all fired up over the Ohio vote and looking for more successes this November. Feel free to sit by and watch but I am doing anything and everything I can to fire up everyone I can about this next election.  ,COents,czembk5,2,t5_2sh6j

6606315,0,t1_d02g64c,Im going to have to disagree with you. Key Badge employees have nothing to do with experience in the eyes of the MED. It has everything to do with responsibility levels. Many employers mine for example will not spend  red penny on  badges for the employers because the company does not own the badge. The badge belongs to the employee and if the employee decides to leave for another opportunity within the industry they can take the badge with them. So they dont pay for it. Doing so would just be asking for an unneeded expense on the part of the company. Also not having your Key Badge is limiting. Your employer may cover your badge fee but what they really doing is preventing you from going on to bigger and better things. As I said the Key Badge has nothing literally  to do with experience. Dont believe me? Heres what the MED says about the Key Badgegt Necessary for employees that make operational or management decisions that directly impact the business.  An example of such an employee is a master grower that determines what or how much of a particular strain to produce or an individual whose decisions have a significant impact on the business and its operations but does not have an ownership interest in the business.Medical Marijuana Occupational LicensingI fell prey to the appeal of the cheaper Support Badge and its screwing me right now. I dont even work in a store or a grow but my responsibility level requires that I hold a Key Badge. If you want to loose your Support Badge and job really quickly continue making operational or management decisions that directly impact the business without the Key Badge. The MED will not hesitate to destroy and employer amp employer with a fine. ,COents,d02nci6,1,t5_2sh6j
