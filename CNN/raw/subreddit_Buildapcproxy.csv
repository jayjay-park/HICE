6992904,0,t3_4bg2rj,Hi ShaanTo answer your questions it is generally cheaper to buy together as it helps minimize shipping costs which can be pretty excessive when shipping internationally. As for testing that depends on the proxy.Now I have a few questions for you.  Would you be open to suggestions for different parts? One of the major issues is that not everything youre requesting is available from Microcenter.  If youre not open to suggestions for different parts do you understand that it may take longer to gather parts from the various stores?BlackPhoton,Buildapcproxy,d18zl2f,1,t5_37i5u
