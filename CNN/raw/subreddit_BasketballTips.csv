99011,0,t3_1v88l3,First you need to learn how to box out.  Im sure there are several youtube videos that can explain it better than I can.  But just make sure your body is on theirs.  Dont give them a clean jumping lane arms out wide your ass into their hip catch the ball at its apex with both hands.Secondly watch the shooters release and the rotation of the ball.  A flat shot tends to have long rebounds.  Rebounds with arc and spin tend to get shooters rolls and are rebounded closer to the rim.Third check out this article.  Its pretty interesting analytics showing where a rebound is most likely to go depending on where the shot is being put up.   Lastly practice and make it a focus.  Find out where rebounds end up is a skill that you will have to develop over time and not something you can fix over night.,BasketballTips,ceppawd,2,t5_2tt6s

2525212,0,t3_2okg5z,The answers to your questions are always subjective based on your matchup and what the defense gives you. Just develop that instinct and see what you prefer.. Watch a few youtube videos of Pau Gasol facing up and driving he has some amazing moves and they translate really well no matter what height you are. If Im smaller than my matchup i try to jab around and see if I can get them moving the wrong way. If Im bigger I feel more comfortable going straight into a more powerful move.. Faceup jumpers are legit sometimes you can catch people snoozing on you pretty bad since a lot of people expect you to put the ball on the floor. Melo is a beast at this since most players cant contain him on a post up so they get worried about him getting to the block and give him a little space.. Totally situational. Although sometimes guys like me with sneaky long arms will get easy shot contests if you assume youre quicker. You just have to take whatever your matchup gives you.,BasketballTips,cmo6kgj,4,t5_2tt6s

I think Demarcus cousins is the best at simply being strong in the post.That being said a jump shot could never hurt. being versatile will keep you from being too predictable. Problem is if you have to shoot  to  fadeaways to establish yourself you better actually make those shots. dont throw away possessions for fadeaways. Also footwork is a great thing up and unders and being a good passer as well no one says you have to shoot the ball every time you get it. in fact those are the worst bigs. bigs should be able to hit the cutter and kick it back out when double teamed. One guy i suggest you watch video of is Hakeem Olajuwon. Try and learn his dream shake and stuff. will improve your offensive game,BasketballTips,cokzrg8,2,t5_2tt6s

The back to  feet then the free throw line doing the same thing?  Its a long process but they only way to eliminate a hitch is through making sure your form is right.

First I got stronger and could shoot without jumping so I developed a stype that does not involve the muscles that are usually exhausted in a game depends on the individual for me its lower back and the front of the thighs. Second I just got rid of any routine before the shot and just did what I felt fit at the time. Third I developed a more assymetrical shot with my left leg back righthanded. I noticed that many poor shooters have wide shoulders and fail to shoot assymetrically.So your idea simply kills the routine before shooting.

5723056,0,t3_3tik4w,I went through the same thing in highschool.  Sometimes its easy to get flustered if youre thinking about the movement of the play while you have the ball.  Ask your coach if he has any tape of the offense running or take the playbook home and walkthrough it on a whiteboard until you can run it without thinking.   Once youre good go to practice and while youre running the offense autopilot! you should be able to focus more on beating your man and playing good fundamental basketball.  If youre still having trouble then you need to get as much game speed ball handling experience as possible.  Grab a buddy and work through scenarios youre having trouble with.  I know I struggled with doubles and contact heavy d until I got enough game speed experience.  Biggest thing is keep at it.

Static stretching holding a stretch for a long time done before strength training can make muscles weaker for the workout. You can still stretch and strength train but you must change the order of things.

6784895,0,t1_d0l9t0x,If you can make open shots consistently like you say thats really the biggest thing so I dont think you need to do anything drastic to your shot just little adjustments. My other piece of advice would be to work on other aspects of your game that will help you get more open shots like Shooting coming off screens  this involves practice reps at game speed and working on squaring your body to the hoop as you come around and catch the ball and then shooting quickly. It is hard at first but it just takes time and repetitions.  Quickness and ballhandling. If youre a threat to beat defenders off the dribble then they have to respect that part of your game giving you more opportunities to get an open shot Once you have those things down you can start working on moves to give yourself more space like stepback moves. Isaiah Thomas of the Boston Celtics is only  but he is able to get his shot off against NBA players because he has a great stepback move that allows him to create space to get his shot off. Hes also very athletic but hes facing some of the tallest and most athletic guys in the world which you are not.,BasketballTips,d0lcrdy,1,t5_2tt6s

PAnyways its still impossible to say what you should work on because I have no idea what your playstyle is. But Id recommend drills to create space. Work on your ball handling. Become the balls new best friend. Take him to places where hes never gone before. I love hesitations because they take little to no energy to do and Im able to go from  to  right past them. Im sort of built so its hard for the defender to reach in and steal it from me. Usually when I get close enough to the paint I take a super fast analysis of my environment. Unfortunately Id have to draw up a tree to talk about all the possible moves for any given scenario on the court. But playing pick up games at your closest basketball court is probably the best way to get better. With enough time that diagram I mentioned above will become second nature because youve gone through it enough time to know what the probability is for a certain move at that moment to be successful or not. ,BasketballTips,d1eqv82,2,t5_2tt6s
7349181,0,t1_d2dhjuz,If you breakdown Curry shooting since college his one motion shooting is theoretically just the mastered version of twomotion shooting.  Like Kemba said Curry has a truly unique skill.  He has perfected the transition from up to out in such a way people classify it is a different style of shooting.The goal of true shooting is to get the ball out as fast as possible and continue to be accurate.  Curry over  years has been working on perfecting his shot and shaving micro seconds off his release.  Before you can start shaving time off of your release you are going to have to get to a point where you are shooting at an elite clip.  Remember Currys dad was an exNBA player and Curry grew up around the best of the best in basketball.Your shooting is an art form and without a solid foundation you will never be able to hone your skills to an elite level.,BasketballTips,d2djv6r,2,t5_2tt6s
7399530,0,t3_4g8qin,I had a similar problem. My shot was and still often is inconsistent. Sometimes it just feels great leaving my hands and I know its going in. Beautiful spin on the ball high arc etc. Then sometimes it just clanks off front iron and is ugly af. What I realized recently is that I was not using my eyes properly. You have to pick a specific point usually on the front of the rim and aim at that point. Aim small miss small. I used to just look generally at the rim and heave it in that direction. Now I aim for the midway point on the front of the rim and Ive been having much more success. The way to do that is to train your eyes when you practice. Make sure you look at a single point on the rim EVERY TIME you shoot in practice. It will come naturally in games. One trick I adopted was to embrace the bank shot. The midrange bank shot from the wing is a shot I take when my straighton jumpers arent falling. The bank gives you a little more room for error and more importantly it gives you an easy place to aim your eyes. Aim right at the top corner of the square. Nobody ever told me about aiming your eyes and it has made a huge difference in my shooting. Point and shoot. Good luck. ,BasketballTips,d2ja0az,2,t5_2tt6s

8217087,0,t3_4rvp9v,Lots of questions so Ill just respond to the one about passing.  You cannot get better at passing without experimentation.  Of course you should practice the mechanics of passing  chest overhead bounce right hand off the bounce left hand off the bounce etc.  Being able to throw a great pass in a practice situation is only half the battle.  If you want to develop into a top tier passer you will need to spend lots of time in games working on passes.  You will need to take risks.  You will turn the ball over.  You will need to take more risks.  You will need to learn about timing.  You will need to learn about angles.  You will need to learn about decision making.  There simply is no other way to do it.  If it makes you more comfortable play with some lesser competition while you work on your passing game.  Also dont keep making the same mistake over and over.  Learn from your mistakes.  If you keep making on point lob passes to a post player but the ball keeps getting stolen you need to figure out that your post player does not know how to properly hold off the defender in order to receive the pass.  Then you make an adjustment such as only making bullet passes to this particular player or simply not passing it to him in the post.  In contrast if you make a bullet pass to someone and they do not have good enough hands to catch such passes you need to realize it is your fault.  A great passer knows what kinds of passes each teammate can handle.  In my opinion passing is a highly valued but rarely developed art.,BasketballTips,d54ow39,1,t5_2tt6s

8641039,0,t3_4y7uo9,The number one easiest way to increase range is to release the ball earlier in the jump. Basically once your feet are not on the ground any more gravity is slowing you down over time.

9017965,0,t3_53oqi1,Plays are good and all but your team doesnt sound that serious no offense its just that my experience with having a team with friends is that they generally dont take training as serious as they should. If you can get a solid playbook by all means do so.If you can though maybe try to work with a couple players individually in order to develop their skills. You need at least one player who can create offense out of nothing especially in the clutch when you cannot call timeouts and setup plays.,BasketballTips,d7vth80,2,t5_2tt6s
9047061,0,t1_d7za9tz,I appreciate the reply but I think you may have glossed over my question. That is a very useful video and thank you I will now be subscribing to that channel. What I am talking about is dealing with illegal defense. Im aware its easier to drive on some one that plays inside your jersey for obvious reasons. Im referring to handchecking a form of defense banned since the s. Now before you say if its illegal call it bro this is casual pickups. Not everyone religiously plays and knows all the rules. This leads to arguements that stop the game for a long period of time and generally makes the whole experience unpleasant. Its not a big enough deal for me to stop the flowing of the game for local pickup. Typically the only fouls people will accept are . Excessive hacking . Travel . Carry. Thats it. Aint no one got the time or paitience to argue calls. With that said back to handchecking. Handchecking is when someone places there hand on your hips and physically impedes your movement to the basket. If you ever try driving on a strong guy with a linebacker physique using his strength to push you youre not going anywhere. This usually pisses me off and I start dropping my shoulder and charging but it isnt a very productive or effective answer. So if anyone has tips on how to work around this it would be much appreciated.,BasketballTips,d7zb8w2,3,t5_2tt6s

9430291,0,t1_d9av319,Thanks for reading dont get me wrong he was not a terrible player. He just didnt play at the level that his skill set would suggest. He was the last cut for the spurs one year and would have made the team but refused to pass Tim Duncan the ball funny story for another day.I think his struggles came mostly from a combination of confidence and IQ. At one point he was a top  high school player nationally and he didnt transition to college well. I think high school was too easy for him because he was bigger stronger and faster than everyone. And when he couldnt get going in college I think his confidence took huge hit which he never recovered. Also he could do drills really well but in a game situation he would have to think about the move he was going to do which slowed his moves down to a point were they wouldnt be effective. He was not operating on instinct he was thinking to much.,BasketballTips,d9bcr4o,2,t5_2tt6s
9561801,0,t3_5bvumc,Im assuming this league doesnt have refs if he can just stop the game like that. Not having refs makes every call ambiguous.However I have plenty of advice for how you should play against it. Forearm in the back defense means hes neglecting the  rule of post D which is dont let your man get the ball. You should be able to catch passes with him behind you. And then turn him into BBQ chicken.Dont use your arm to push on his even though its not a foul imo. What you can do is wait for the right time and then suddenly lean your back forward. This should open up opportunities to spin past him to the basket and be openscore.Faceup moves can also work well because you will have separation from his body.Or you can use the forward lean to then plow your butt into him and gain more position.On the defensive end dont put your arm on his back. Dont play behind. Work hard to put yourself in between him and the ball and deny the pass.But if you do feel like playing behind not recommended still dont put your forearm in his back put your thigh on his butt. Much harder to deal with.,BasketballTips,d9ros4o,4,t5_2tt6s

9933428,0,t1_db1rxc8,Notice where your dribble was when he tapped the ball dribble the ball further ahead than that. In general when you blow by someone and there isnt another player just after which there shouldnt you should be keeping your dribble low and ahead of you. You should be low and in attack mode so the dribble will match your stance anyway.,BasketballTips,db2cn39,1,t5_2tt6s

10372105,0,t1_dcimqhi,Hi. Im a basketball skills trainer and coach. Hers some advice that may help . Front Everything most people play from behind allowing the opponent to catch the ball. Youve already put yourself at a disadvantage. Front the post deny all passes to the wing and always play from in front. Most opponents have no idea what to do with this. The weak points in this defense is the lob and the back door. The back door you have to feel and see either way its a more difficult pass then reversing the ball with no defensive pressure. If the back door gets through its a lay up so you have to hustle and also work with teammates. The lob is the same your teammates should be backing you up and stealing lobs. But you also have time to spin and get around back if needed on the pass because it takes so long for the lob to come down. . Sit on the strong hand. Always force a dribbler to their weak hand. Do not let them dribble to their strong side. When then try to go back to their strong side because they cant play with their weak hand steal the ball. . Stance and footwork are key. I teach more of martial arts fighting stance or front stance than I do the wide deep defensive stance most teach. This allows my players to be quicker more explosive and leads to more steals as well as less blow bys. Theres too much to say in this post so Id advise you study some martial arts fighting stances and well as fencing and notice the stance and footwork. Ali and Bruce Lee are great too. . Finally always have the best cardio on the court. Work hard on your cardio and endurance so that youre playing at another speed for the entire game. Defense becomes most affective in the late stages of the game when the body and mental of the opponent is burning out. ,BasketballTips,dcjqnoy,3,t5_2tt6s
10526689,0,t1_dd0jdk2,I know Im not the guy you asked but the reason why the ball touches Stephs hand as well as every other NBA players is because in real time game you dont have enough time to adjust the ball to sit on your finger tips. That being said hes not a palm shooter persay. He still uses his thumb and fingers to shoot with the ball as you can see in motion on this video here.,BasketballTips,dd1bccx,1,t5_2tt6s

I strongly urge you to not give up and keep persisting because basketball is a read and react sport so dont expect results quickly. However expect results quickly the more you keep persisting.
