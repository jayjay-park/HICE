169862,0,t1_cexr0ou,Hmm well Mookler.  Out of game ads are not the only way of marketing a game especially when a game is free to play.  With the a FP game organic growth and ad spends on retention of players outweighs ad spends on the acquisition of new players.  Yes maybe an ad spend at the initial launch of a FP game is worthy or if youre Riot an ad spend years after the game has launched may still be beneficial but at this point in time it is not wise to market like that.We continue to try and branch out into other gaming audiences i.e. our partnership with SoundBlaster Alienware and so on.  We will and are continuing to do this to show the consistency that HoN has shown on the market and to continue to reach new possible users.  Saying that HoN has not been marketed is a bit unwarranted because there have been many ads outside of the game.

819857,0,t3_23ix2u,I am quite good at supporting and can keep myself at  on my support only accounts. Not world class but still something. I must agree with OP to some degree. The logic that only supports should by wards hold true and that all gold possible should go to the carry then by the same logic supports should also buy tps and health potions ALL the time. It is needed and why spend carrys gold? Note that I do buy these things in good games when I have a lot of extra gold. However if you have freefarm short lane and you support does not have boots after  minutes you are probably better of getting your own ward than asking you struggling support to get one the team is probably better of if the support is able to get boots.People do not seems to realize that getting one ward yourself is better than dying two or three times from ganks. Because farmers always blame supports after they get ganked instead of realizing farming alone in the dark is dangerous and get aask for a ward. Sure in a good going game where the support has a steady income there should be no reason to get you own wards tps and pots. But that is not always the case.,HeroesofNewerth,cgxgxl6,1,t5_2r497

941726,0,t3_24w0vl,We the CustomHoN channel and website community started our amazing journey when Jonathan released modified .dll files in order to be able to host any HoN game with any map on any computer with decent internet connexion and correct portforwarding configuration. This is a tutorial I made if you want to host for your friends or if you want to know how hosting works.  Soon enough a ValkWarz map was playable on v.  I learned how to use the HoN map editor so I was involved in a lot of project for example heres a makingof of my work on the Run Kitty Run map with Zaars.  The most noticables and played maps were    Cursed Carry by HyperXewl its basically Riftwars released  months before Ss version with Capture the Flag mode.   Pudge Wars no need for explaination   Pebblesduel code by Techies this is the retexturization I made  Nightmarish coop mode  survival against zombies with special abilities   Arena FFA mode WTF mode  Warlock etc...  The community was growing every day the CustomHon channel was peaking at  users so we started to talk about it in the official forums. After a while S stated they didnt want us to promote CustomHon because we were using modified dll  opened ports which could cause some security issues on our hosting systems. Obviously most of the hosts knew what they were doing so this weak statement from S was hiding the real one  we cant monetize Custom Maps. It was a huge blow into the development of our maps because we didnt expect S to take a move against custom maps dont you remember they promised it to us since  ?. The few ones still promoting Custom Maps were quickly banned from the official forums.  Most of my best moments in HoN were playing Custom Maps I wont forget them. It has been an amazing adventure. ,HeroesofNewerth,chbbwi2,19,t5_2r497

Anyway my point was  These games are all the same from my perspective and all are great. I played HoN for almost two years League for almost  and original Dota for maybe  or  years. Liked all of them. But now when it comes to choose one it is League of course because I play it for years and have a lot of stuff in game like  skins max runepages etc. I am not saying that League better than HoN or Dota. No they are all the same good moba games for me.Another fact is that all my friends are playing League except a few which play Dota . They dont even know what is HoN really. And ofc I want to play with them so I must adapt. If I would pick HoN its like playing a different mmorpg while all of my friends are playing WoW. Just an example. People are playing these games because they can also play with their friends.From your comment I can see that you dont understand me.

If you fail that last step youve wasted a huge amount of resources and accomplished absolutely nothing.  Other heroes that are proficient at splitpushing include Magebanebut his blink has a casttime.  How many times have you seen a Magebane try to blink away but get caught at the last second by a hex?  That doesnt work on Silhouette and I think its what puts her over the top as a splitpusher.My proposed nerf  Give Swap a casttime greater than zero.  You could get fancy and make the cast time scale with illusion distance but I honestly dont think thats necessary.  A cast time in the .. range should be enough to chain stun her with a reasonably coordinated team.,HeroesofNewerth,crf8sx7,6,t5_2r497

Just give a Shrunken Head or Nullstone to the enemy team and voil no more problem. Polys Q still does  from level  assuming maxed first tp level  which is ridiculously low late game. Most real carry will do it on every autoattack. In LoL magic damage of Spellcasters are tied to their ability score.

5943781,0,t1_cxypjox,Well written post but you are most wrong on the needs survivability items before he kicks in. He only needs a mock to truly wreck faces left and right. The only time he is truly weak is from  and that is not a significant enough of a downtime to call the hero weak. That one great function that makes him able to gank while farming is huge. Not only can he burst a hero from anywhere at any time he also does this while revealing all heroes  cancelling all PKs without ANY risk. His ultimate only has a sec CD at rank  which certainly could be much worse if you catch my drift ! so players freely use it to scout they dont even care that they dont catch any with this gamebreaking ultimate.  seconds CD for a spell that has a huge chance to pick someoff lategame dont get me started on how huge pickoffs are at that time and as I stated earlier without any risk at all. The other team can only do  things Nullstones or stick together. I am always afraid for the other team when Sync picks SW against them because Sync has for sure understood how to use SW. And now he is even stronger MUCH stronger. My suggestion Revert the movement speed buff and add a few seconds CDs to his ultimate. Such a gamebreaking and risk free spell should have bigger penalties while its down. Allowing players to actually play around it. ,HeroesofNewerth,cxyrcun,2,t5_2r497

But in reality youre solo queue stuck with  players maybe again theyre queued together but the difference is that theyre picking arachnacalamitycdslither and have no idea how to effectively play those heroes but they are extremely easy heroes for a bad player to perform well with however when it comes time for them to have impact they just end up being shit and get bursted down by magmus midas legio combo and i just laugh as i try to carry them with my oogie. Even though i know those guys arent better players then my self they just carried by picking extremely good heroes vs poor picks and did it together. Didnt mean to rant here but any games above  is a joke. Like you said high queue times player queues.

10242001,0,t1_dc4y5kn,Strange setups work at the top level because teams are so familiarized with one another they know how each other play their preferred heroes their strengths and weaknesses and all their little tendencies that doing something different can completely throw all that preparation off. Plus at the top level a lot of mind games happen during the draft teams will deliberately bait out picks so they can run certain antistrats. If you know that a certain team likes to run a  core Klanx and you have a specific strat that runs that line up over youd leave Klanx out of the ban fool them into thinking theyre in their comfort zone and smash them. You cant compare top level organized play to public games. In  of tmm games only basic communication happens during the picking stage so majority of the time you win by simply outplaying your opponent and what better way to play than the standard default setup and fight head on if you know youre better than your opponents?Im not saying that there arent other viable setups other than running a suicidejungle but theyre just harder to pull off.

11149188,0,t1_devnpr1,Wow.  Huge database.  Very impressive and mustve taken lots of time.First of all after reviewing some of the tags I think you could consider adding certain roles.  My perspective comes from HOTS which I think is where you got the specialist and a lot of Hon.  You could add ganker which their role is more specifically someone who goes on the hunt to kill people or has good burst damage e.g. Nova Zeratul Bubbles Arachna.  Assassin in my mind is more of someone that deals good sustaindps but not necessarily but can also be a ganker.My interpretation of Marksman here is skillshot heroes vs. point and click ergo the addition or subtraction of their roles.  If thats not what you meant then whatever.Couple feedback changes in re. to hero roles Andromeda  addSupport Arachna  minusTank ganker Artillery  mage assassin Balphagore  Tank Blitz  support warrior questionable instinctively no. Kind of depends on your definition too I guess warrior ganker Chronos  tank Corrupted disciple  assassin mage Doctor replusor  specialist marksman Drunken  tank Ellonia  assassin Emerald  marksman assassin maybe specialist his bird is akin to lvl  anubarak ult Engineer  support assassin Fayde  ganker Flint  ass Gauntlet  marksman ganker Gemini  mage spec Grinex  ganker Gunbalde  gank Magmus  gank Midas  gankass? starting to mold ganker amp assassin together based on your categories Moon queen  marksman Myrm  marksman wtf you suddenly have hybrid now?!?  Several of before mentioned can def be hybrids supportassasin tankassasin etc Oogie  marks Ophelia  spec Panda  tank HYBRID Plague  support HYBRID assasinsuper team fight killer Polly  hybrid ass Puppet  Unique abilities but maybe not spec Shadowblade  anything you want triplebrid tank Shell  hybrid supp Sir  ass tank range melee only early on Slither  ass Succ  tank Tarot  marksman? Valk  ass ganker Vind  not spec in my mind but I can understand Wildsoul  melee Witch  support EDIT Specialist probably needs a reimagined definition in Hon.  Organically Hon doesnt really have any specialists compared to HOTS.  There are definitely some heroes that have very unique abilities but in my mind specialists mean split pushers Xul Naz weird abilities Hammer Murky andor heroes that dont fit the mold of support healer warrior bruiser.  Specialists in Hon could be heroes like Ophelia micro hero aka TLV King Klout global ult initationteleport Shadowblade unique skillset.  Understandably not all roles can be transferrable across different games so its going to be really opinionated,HeroesofNewerth,devqycp,4,t5_2r497
