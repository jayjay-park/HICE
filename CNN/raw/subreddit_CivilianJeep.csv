To clarify it sat  yrs but it only took a couple months to make road worthy.  Good luck and enjoy the experience of restoringmaintaining a piece of history!,CivilianJeep,cnkjn7s,1,t5_326ql

4470557,0,t3_3cbcxm,The DUI single wire ignition is a huge upgrade.  It gets rid of many failure points and give a much hotter spark.There are inexpensive Weber carb kits that are a pretty easy install.Keep an eye on the special return style fuel filter that keeps fuel circulating and helps with vapor lock.  The AMC  two piece shafts are always suspect but it is a fairly easy change to aftermarket one piece shafts.   do the rear brakes at the same time    ,CivilianJeep,csu6rrf,3,t5_326ql
