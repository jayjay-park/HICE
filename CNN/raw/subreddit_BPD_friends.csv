5538946,0,t3_3qm8nb,Hi Im in the same situation. Does he know that you suffer from BPD? I havent told the guy Im dating yet. I dont want him to freak out. Im afraid if I tell him hell run away. How did you tell the guy youre dating? how did he react? I understand your reaction. Its hard to stop over thinking about the relationship. Did you come up with a solution? What did you decide about the relationship? ,BPD_friends,cwjndbe,1,t5_30wf4
