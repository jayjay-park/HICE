So yeah I wouldnt be complaining so much but the fact that MS doesnt seem like they are giong to budge on this issue of compatability or upgrading their current version makes me want to just walk away from this game completely. As with the JP Version of MS I feel like that game and their culture is going to thrive while the NA version is going to struggle mainly because of just will not use money to buy orbs.

2808546,0,t3_2s8ibx,To try to summarize clearly his point in the videoEach time you do a fusion of the same monster not only will the stats carry over but any stats on the food monster have a chance to double if you hit a mega fusion. So the most effective method is to add your stats to one monster then feed that plused one to a fresh one. Each time you do this you run a chance at doubling the effectiveness of the morlings you farmed. This works even when luck fusing before ascension.,MonsterStrike,cnnbnab,2,t5_304xn

Whereas with NDW you cant really dodge or deal that great damage when a gravity barrier is present.I think it essentially boils down to personal preference though.

4284455,0,t1_cs7f4dj,It really depends on what monsters you have at the moment.Asc Raff is more versatile but if you do have other water NDW monsters there are generally very few dungeons that have both mines and damage walls.That being said there are also very few dungeons that have mines in general.Evo Raffs attack goes up to around k with a mine and Ascs goes to around k.The SS comparison is interesting because Asc can be aimed while Evo needs some setup. I dont think Ive ever actually seen it myself so I cant really speak to the power levelsBasically if you want versatilitydont have very many water monsters youd go with Asc Raff.If you have a bunch of NDW monsters and dont have a minesweeper you could potentially go with Evo for the potentially insane damage output. Personally I would go with Evo if I had a Raff just because I have a lot of water monsters with NDW already and have Kushinada who has the same abilities as Asc Raff on a wood monster. But really you would generally go with Asc unless you want people to look at you funny when you bring her to coop.,MonsterStrike,cs8ktl4,2,t5_304xn

5326210,0,t1_cvqzgu4, MStrikeGundam I am confused about your statement regarding vouchers? I have gone over the patch notes but I cant see that each member needs a voucher to play Online Coop. The way I read it is you cannot host or join a voucher game via online coop. Really it seems online coop will be restricted to hosting normal quests and at most extremes. So the benefit is that people who are not in a advanced progression LINE group can still have access to asc mats as long as people will host them. Social Media coop will ultimately still be the best way to play as there are no restrictions and all benefits. Plus because social media is what it is groups are more cohesive people play better together communication is strong.IMHO online coop is nothing but a convenient pug tool but pug is so not the way to play this game especially end game content.,MonsterStrike,cvshh10,1,t5_304xn

Save until you get  then do the  golden shot on either the legends hatcher or the guardians hatcher since thier exclusives are fucking godly.Especially do the events where new monsters are introduced you will get extra orbs as a reward for them get them all even the extreme ones you can get around  orbs from the mission rewards.
