277131,0,t1_cf9g1ys,I dont believe you. Im sure its within your comprehension you are underestimating yourself. For the vast majority of Miata owners mild mannered baby boomers allseason tires are more than enough tire. Theyre just happy having a cute and cheap little roadster. Having a manual transmission is exotic enough. Id go so far as to say they dont really know the difference.Anyway having cheap tires is good training. If you cant go fast on allseasons then slicks arent going to help either. Same goes with horsepower. That said its a sports car. Its meant for fun. I believe the BRZ comes with Prius tires which makes it pretty fun for the same reason OP mentions. Its easy to slide out even with hp which IMO is plenty to get you into trouble should you go looking for it but nothing to brag about.,Miata,cf9hk06,1,t5_2smzg

Steering feel is better in the Miata all generations but the S steering is as sharp as a razor blade though without much feedback. The lack of torque in the S really gets old during daily driving and I found the cockpit uncomfortable for my  frame though I comfortably drive  hours at a time in the NA. I was either going to end up dead or in jail so I had to sell the Honda. Snap oversteer is real on early cars manageable for a skilled driver but not what I would call a fun feature. The S is perfect on paper but the overall experience fell flat for me. Now if youre going to be spending your time on a  track a stock S will blow away any stock Miata... But for fun daily driving I think an NC Miata is a good compromise between the fun character of the NA and the solidity and speed of the S. I have owned more than a dozen cars but I always come back to the Miata. I have come to a point where I really dont care about HP and believe the cliche that driving a slow car fast is a lot more fun than driving a fast one slow.,Miata,clantxq,2,t5_2smzg

You also may need to set your white balance prior to shooting..  When I say high I dont mean f. because thats the complete opposite of what I said. Photo  is a white balance issue. Set it before you shoot.Here is my old civic SI shot at f I think it was about a  second exposure. Notice the bokea of the lighting? How the lights look like stars instead of just blown out white noise? Thats what you want. See how the wheel faces the camera? It tells the whole story of the vehicle with  shot. Ive got a few good shallow DOF shots on my flickr... I havent shot in years though. Definitely miss it. IMHO if you want a truly KILLER lens find a Minolta mm f. prime. You will shit brix son.

Next dont read too much into the following sentences until you know the results of your testing.   This is purely brain storming ideas that could cause oil on plugs with potentially low power.

I havent located the source of the noise on the rear rotor but I suspect it is warped as it goes skip skip skip at low speeds. Question is. Should I replace the rear brakes only both sides pads and rotors or should I do the sports upgrade all over? The sports kit is of the same dimentions as the stock brakes but with grooves and such.I dont know if the ECB Turbogroves is even worth it on a daily.The car is now stored in a garage  hours away and I dont remember how much of the pads is left on the other wheels but the car has around k miles behind it.Due to the lack of specific info on the status lets say the pads all around is at  wear and the rightrear brake needs replacement either way and speculate from there. It will be a while untill I can examine the brake properly with the wheel off.Thanks in advance for advice.,Miata,cnf4vtg,1,t5_2smzg

Of these I would recommend the Hankook RS vs or the Dunlop Direzza ZII Star Spec. Both of these handle rain pretty well and are the go to tires for autox and track duties. I also know from friends experiences that RSs are quite durable so they should last you at least a year with daily duties and some autox and track driving.,Miata,co8oir9,1,t5_2smzg

3616862,0,t3_31rafg,Check the valve cover gasket andor the plug wells. Leaky valve cover gaskets can short the plug out and cause carbon buildup sometimes resulting in a loss of compression and thus needing a valve job. For me its not a dealbreaker but its something that you should keep your eye out for. Considering my own labor free I think I paid  for valve seals  or so for a valve job and a new HG was around . Not a terrible fix. I do leakdown tests on used motorscars before I get them now not a compression test a real leakdown test which will be very instructive about the condition of the motor. Also do a check on the base timing SNC issues can often be identified by a shift in base timing because the crank drive pulley is out of place. ,Miata,cq4jqyp,2,t5_2smzg

4262011,0,t3_39sfip,I know youre set on getting the Miata but I do see what your parents are saying. Im not familiar with your countrys market  culture for cars but it looks like you can get a brand new car for the same price as the NA. If thats really the case then I would find it difficult to choose the Miata. But I dont like spending money so that is just my opinion. Id rather put my money towards something brand new than  years old if I was going to spend it in this case.For the clutch it depends on how long youre in traffic. Its not bad if youre not in traffic for more than a half hour or hour. Longer than that and youll probably get tired.The Miata is pretty easy to work on but there is a lot more to it. Do you have the tools to work on the car? A nice socket set and a good hydraulic jack and jack stands are required at minimum. Do you have a place to do the work? Do you have the time  willingness to set aside half your day to do work and live without a car if something goes wrong? Can you get the parts and will they be affordable? If no then you may be better off spending your money on the new car and getting a Miata later. The engine will be fine with those numbers if it was maintained. The question is whether you are able and willing to do the maintenance required for some of the larger items if they need to be replaced. Clutch convertible top timing belt etc. That is why I think a new car is a good choice here  you do not have to worry about that stuff if you have a limited budget. ,Miata,cs61pkr,5,t5_2smzg

4294906,0,t1_cs9n8uc,I totally agree about them not being appropriate on a car that is mostly a street car. I didnt mean to imply that everybody should get some. They totally suck at idle and mid rangepartial throttle. The grown up in my understand that the factory system is superior in just about every way.But the kid in me loves em for the look and sound and jaw dropping street cred that you get when some  year old kid sees them on your car.I had a Datsun  with dual Weber DCOEs when I was younger. They looked awesome. They sounded awesome. They made kids who were younger than the can gawk at it at autocrosses.But every single year when autocross season was over and I still had to drive the car to work in the cold Id spend a day yanking them off and cleaning them up and storing them away. And Id put on a simple Weber DGV that made  as much power and was  more fuel efficient. And then in the Spring Id procrastinate on putting them back on because other than the sound and the slight power gain at WFO they were awful to live with.ITBs arent impossible to live with  if you do them right. Theyre not unsafe or anything. You can still work out a system for positive crankcase ventilation. Theyre not onoff switches like Indy Cars use. Most people would not choose them for a street car but there is a reason that some people do... maybe not good reasons but there is a method to their madness anyway...,Miata,cs9rb2x,4,t5_2smzg

4724602,0,t3_3fm6vy,Oxygen and fuel have to be mixed at correct ratio to burn properly in an engine. Different fuels have different ratios. Normal gasoline octane rating is irrelevant require roughly .kg of air per  kg of gasoline. Ethanol E E requires  kg of air per  kg of ethanol. Lower ratio means less air and more fuel. Your engine was designed to squirt in fuel to match the . ratio but you have filled up a fuel that needs the ratio of . Therefore your engine is running too lean lean  too much air and not enough fuel for proper combustion and causing the immediate problems with power and stalling. Drain the tank and refill with appropriate fuel. You can save the E you drained out and mix in L per full tank L to burn it off and recover your money.

Also if you drive a manual in winter going neutral  and braking is absolutely useless  you lose your grip instantly whereas downshifting lets you maintain traction slowing down.If you downshift as you stop you also get more practice working the gears its a winwin.,Miata,cu5ylbh,5,t5_2smzg

Drive it and make sure it starts idles shifts revs and stops okay.

A man at ICB Motor Sports specifically told me that he thought my notion of JDM hardtops being in the  range was unrealistic and that itd be difficult to safely ship these parts en masse from JapanI dont believe that part but Im no expert so whatever. I even resorted to calling some more known Miata vendors to see if theyd be interested at all but they told me itd be too difficult for them to import from Japan and he tried to sell me their fiberglassCF tops instead.So yeah looks like reasonably priced hardtops might be a pipe dream unless you happen to live in Japan.,Miata,d237o46,3,t5_2smzg

Yeah the revs get high k rpm in th gear is just at or slightly less than mph if I remember right but the engine can certainly handle it.  So many people think high revs are bad for your engine.  If they were the manufacturer wouldve put the redlinefuel cutoff lower andor geared it taller.  Miatas live above rpm.  If you crank up the stereo loud enough you wont even notice the engine noise.I did the  hours in a straight shot with  gas stops and  additional bathroom stop.  Only thing that suffered any wear was my back.It had the mph shimmy though which had me worried but I googled it at a fuel stop and discovered that it was normal.  My solution?

7709944,0,t1_d3hux1t,My car had functional power steering when I bought it. I swapped in a new OE manual rack when I replaced my suspension bushings at around k miles. The steering is a tad slower but not very much so. The power racks were . turns lock to lock vs . for the manual rack which makes the manual rack around  slower. Driven back to back it was noticeable but now that Ive adjusted it doesnt really cross my mind.As for driving impressions the steering is more commutative with the manual rack but not enough to justify the manual conversion in and of itself. In my case I wanted a new OE rack since my power rack had developed a little slop and the only one available was the manual rack. If youve ever driven a manual steering car before you learn to start creeping before you turn the wheel.

While they do last a long time it is a wear item and does need replacing at some point. Why not just get it done and have the peace of mind. On the other hand you introduce air into the system you have to process a lot more brake fluid its messy messier than just bleeding the system you really should use flare nut wrenches so now you have to get those etc....

I searched for months before finding the right one. I found my  at a dealership while I was in a work meeting. I sent them an email from my phone and test drove it on lunch. It had k miles and looked clean as hell. Of course it was  years old so not that clean and it had been tracked. Upon closer inspection I found no rust and lots of FM parts. The plastic in the wheel well was rubbing on a hard left so I had them do a full inspection before pulling the trigger. Ended up driving it home the next day. The internet price was . The showroom price was . Chances are if they find out youre serious about buying theyll work with you. One caveat to this  make sure you buy from a large reputable dealer not a small corner lot. The small places will buy up shitty cars from auction usually from people that had them repod etc and generally didnt take care of their car.

It took the dealership one day. They did a perfect job and took care not to scratch my paint or damage the interior. The new top is a revised design and I have had  problems with it so far. It was actually a very satisfying customer service experience. It took them a few weeks to get the top after I reported the problem because Mazda was still getting all the revised tops ready to ship out.I cant image WTF is going on at your dealership to have them keep the car for that long. Mazda already has a revised top. They will probably not do a recall but they have multiple TSBs for several issues with the top. They should be replacing your entire top frame and all. I wonder if you are getting screwed because you brought it in before they had the revised top ready so they are trying multiple piecebypiece fixes to resolve it.

I dont own an mx I am looking at changing from my d to a mk . however Ive owned two convertibles. When the weather is dry take a hose to your car and apply a little water at a time with the car closed. First try above the door on the roof give it  second hosing. Open the door check for a leak. Next try on the join between the roof and windscreen. Same again  seconds and check. Just keep going to similar locations where theirs a join between the door and body.Im guessing the biggest possible cause us the window being out if adjustment or agedworn weather seals.This was the case with my crx del sol and I had to take the door card off and adjust  out of  bolts to make the window lean in a tad more. Someone also had the genius idea to inject filler all the way down the rain channel if the a pillar weather strip.... Which made thing s worse.,Miata,d7r6hw7,2,t5_2smzg

Its difficult to judge the sound from a short video with no AFM or intake connected. Once the rest of the intake is on you can try again but be careful if it isnt showing any oil pressure. Maybe try once more and if theres no oil pressure then dont run it again until you figure something out. You can rentborrow an oil pressure gauge to double check. Once thats sorted then fix the fuel leak and check the CEL.,Miata,d8ww0zh,2,t5_2smzg

A day later youll probably have enough to write a service bulletin on the question. TONS of helpful friendly owners are there to guide you. Do the right thing and research first since many questions have been asked before. Tip Google your question siteforum.miata.net  its better than the forum search tool.But most jobs can be handled DIY and you dont need a lot of tools either. In fact if you asked what are the easiest cars to work on while also learning how things work? in a more general car forum Im guessing NA Miata would be a popular answer.

It even has a  year sun fadechalkflake gurantee. Yes once its on its not supposed to come off. Im sure he was fully aware of that once he rolled it on. It only warns you  times thats its a permanent coating. Ive seen hundreds of jeeps that thrash theirs on trails with Monstaliner. Some have had theirs on for  years straight now with minor trail rash. And if you still think its going to turn into a lumpy mess then Google it... Actually comment exactly what you said on any jeep forum or even rjeep and let me know what responses you get.  The only people that have issues with it flaking are the ones who didnt prep it correctly. If you follow the directions to a tee youll have absolutely zero issues. Oh and its super easy to apply. Spray or roll it on... Some people have different tastes. And I think its  unique and probably the only one around like it.

TopLoc apparently provides goodlooking window warning stickers. Im not a fan of stickers but I might put one on if they were small welldesigned and not grosslooking. Timing was great. A couple of days ago I decided to get locks. Locks over braces because since I live in a place that gets mixed weather even in Summer Ill be switching between top amp topless quite a bit.

The ECU is in the passenger floorpan IIRC and if it got into any other electronics or significant wiring you run the risk of serious problems down the line. You also almost surely need all new door cards carpet and seats. The water may cause rust on mechanical parts that arent meant to be submerged like ball joints steering racks and the like.If youre not mechanically inclined enough to evaluate what needs repair and replacement I would not buy it.

Unless you live in some little village out in the countryside of germany youre going to have to pull out into traffic at some point in your life and if its a busy intersection you may have to get on the throttle to merge safely. You may also at some point need to accelerate quickly to get out of harms way if a distracted motorist is about to cause an accident near you. They just need to trust that youre going to be a responsible motorist rather than trying to get a car with built in parental controls that could just end up getting you hurt.

11775103,0,t1_dgupryy,Thank you for the help. Im a little apprehensive of going with these brands that I dont really see on track or Auto X much. I know its not super high stress on the wheels but Id sure hate to chew up the car because of a wheel exploding. I know enkei is a reputable brand and have had a set of their wheels before I just really hate that particular styleI know I shouldnt care. I am going to keep an eye out on used wheels and talk with some of the other NC guys at the next event as well.Out of curiosity how competitive were you in csp and what other mods did you do for that?,Miata,dguqrjo,1,t5_2smzg

11808680,0,t1_dgy9uz0,Youre not the first person to say that and probably wont be the last lol! Guy I picked the RPFs up from was trying to get me to trade them but Im keeping all the OEM LE stuff. If I decide to sell the car itll be much easier as a stock LE.,Miata,dgyjzh0,2,t5_2smzg
