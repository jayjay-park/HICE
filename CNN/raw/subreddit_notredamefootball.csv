9766679,0,t3_5f2k44,I think the NCAA needs to reassess how they do reviews.  Not just Notre Dame games but other games I see some pretty big mistakes being made.  This season is very concerning for the future of our program.  Something is obviously wrong I dont know whether that could be the strength and conditioning of the team the head coach the assistant coaches but something is off.  We have players who are talented and who are considered the best in the country. Our line at the beginning of the year was talked highly of and look at what has happened.Kelly needs to take a hard look at his program.  We had so many close loses. Why couldnt we finish those games out?  I kind of wonder what hell have to do next year to secure his job for another season.,notredamefootball,dagykkx,7,t5_2uhr8
9773786,0,t3_5f5ujt,Yeah cant believe he did that. Kelly didnt see them and with the stomping Kelly had no clue what was going on until he talked to an assistant and went over there and gave him an earful.,notredamefootball,dahu35i,4,t5_2uhr8
