1259260,0,t1_cib7of3,This is actually the real reason rather than the competitiveness factor.  The Guiana Shield a land mass of mostly untouched mountains and jungles separates Suriname French Guinea and Guyana from Brazil and Venezuela and it has pretty much prevented much interaction between those  nations from the rest of South America similar to how the Himalayas have prevented much cultural exchange between India and China.Because of that those  nations have interacted more with the Caribbean and they feel closer to North America than South America.  It is incredibly difficult to drive through the Guiana Shield and its even very hard to fly over it too.  From Suriname you can fly to anywhere in Europe yet you cant travel by plane from Suriname to Brazil despite them sharing a border EDIT Double checked yes you can.Also Guyana is one of the nations that make up the West Indies Cricket Team confirming its Caribbean culture rather than South American culture.,SoccerNoobs,ciba5zm,3,t5_326cz

Both those colors are considered dark and against FIFA regs dark playing dark.  Spains away jersey is black which ruled that out and Netherlands home jersey is orange which is too close to Spains home red.So Spain had to have a jersey designed for the game and ended up with the white they wore. ,SoccerNoobs,cibkszd,1,t5_326cz

1279061,0,t3_28qknz,One thing about European soccer that seems bizarre to me as an American sports fan is that the most prestigious domestic competitions have no playoff.  Theres a second competition with a playoff system but theyre like a singleelimination tournament from the outset. And this second singleelimination tourney includes every soccer team from all levels of competition.  But no one really cares about this second one.By analogy imagine the NFL having  competitions.  In the first competition the team with the best regular season wins.  So last year Denver and Seattle tied for the best record at .  Denver would be the awarded the winner with the tiebreaker of point differential.  So theyd be the NFL champions.  And everyone cares about this trophy.In the second competition every NFL team plays singleelimination.  But this competition includes nonNFL teams too.  So youd throw in all the Arena league teams.  You keep playing until theres one winner.  But since this competition takes place in the same season as the first competition teams dont care about it as much.  Teams regularly sit their starters in this competition until it gets close to finals.TLDR  theres no playoffs in prestigious domestic European soccer competitions like American sports.,SoccerNoobs,cidifei,6,t5_326cz

1575852,0,t3_2cb4fc,Its usually down to two factors. One as uadamin has already pointed out is that clubs cannot afford the players wages anymore. This has been prevalent with teams like QPR as seen with Loic Remy where they spend a lot of money on transfers and wages to try and become competitive in the Premier League only to be relegated. What usually follows is bigger clubs picking off the best players from the relegated team however if their wages are very high then they are less attractive to these teams for transfer. So instead the relegated team will try to loan the player if the club they are loaning them to agrees to pay a percentage of his wage or all of it if they are lucky. In this way it is less of a risk for the bigger club and the smaller club gets a bit of financial relief.The other instance you mentioned is normally because a player wants to leave but no agreement can be reached for a transfer between clubs. Its easy to forget that not every transfer saga is like Bale transferring to Real Madrid. Often a player will politely say he wants to leave the club he plays for will entertain offers but no one will be able to match his valuation. In Michus case this is probably because to Swansea he is a very valuable and popular player and while teams like Napoli were clearly interested in his talent they were also aware that he is approaching  so his resale value is low has only had one season of real note and is just coming off a year where he spent a long time injured. All of these factors meant that Napoli probably werent willing to cough up the  million which Swansea would ask for. However ultimately Michu still wants to leave for a bigger team and Swansea do not benefit at all from having a player on high wages who does not want to play for the team on the bench. In this instance a loan to Napoli saves Swansea several million in wages and gives Napoli a chance to try before they buy so to speak if he plays well they can purchase him for less than he would have cost this summer if he doesnt hes only cost them a years wages.,SoccerNoobs,cjdt4hj,4,t5_326cz

2908296,0,t3_2tfc8v,Its partly a hangover from pretransfer window days. Until about  years ago players could be bought from clubs up until about  weeks before the end of the season. So you could technically get to the FA Cup semi final buy an entirely new team and win the cup with other players. So they created the cup tied rule to avoid anything like that happening.

3320385,0,t3_2y6orx,A lot of teams wont have the right players to hold on to the ball for extended periods of time. Especially if theyre playing against a team that inherently plays a possession based style. Another thing is if they are heavy underdogs and would be happy with a low scoring maybe  draw. Then they just focus on defending by getting players behind the ball and leaving one or two quick players up top to run at the opposition goal on the counter. This is quite effective as possession based teams tend to commit more players forward to provide more passing options. When the ball is turned over the transition can leave them exposed at the back if too many players are committed forward. This is when a counterattacking side will try to strike by playing their forwards with a quick long ball that bypasses the opponents midfield.,SoccerNoobs,cp6r3dj,4,t5_326cz
3374149,0,t3_2y8tds,Something to consider is the sheer physical size of the US versus Europe. Just eyeballing it but combining UK Spain France Italy Portugal and Netherlands arguably the  strongest national leagues youd get a land mass that would fit into the US west of Texas. UK to Italy tip to tip probably goes from California to Illinois.Once I realized this it became clear why American sports have regional conferences. From a travel logistics and player fatigue schedule it makes sense for the Giants Redskins and Eagles Cowboys being a bit removed to play each other twice a season.If anything the European model seems to make more sense as a default setup. You play the teams in your country and then as a side competition you play the top teams from the neighboring countries. ,SoccerNoobs,cpcvm29,-1,t5_326cz
4068120,0,t1_crjnjy2,I think the other argument is with regard to sports that have a salary cap. Here in Australia AFL NRL etc. have a salary cap and a draft that is favourable to teams that finish lower on the table thus there is an instilled belief in putting faith in a coach to build a strong team from a group of young players.On the flip side coaches become highly disposable in football because for every season a club spends out of success it becomes harder to get back to being a top team. Look at Liverpool  they were out of the Champions League for years and now its a real struggle for them to attract top quality players. It also explains why Man United went out and spent big after finishing th under Moyes.,SoccerNoobs,crjzso9,3,t5_326cz

10731888,0,t1_ddmvzfy,Interesting logic. So youre saying its a tradeoff. You get one guy who can use his hands but in exchange you are devastatingly punished for any fouls in that area. But I still have the same issue with it. It still seems like an artificial scenario to award a highpercentage shot from a foul which did not infringe on such a shot and might not have even had to do with a shot attempt at all. Especially in a game with often very small margins. But I see the logic in what you are saying as to why a foul that gets what is a nonconsequential free kick elsewhere gets a severe matchchanging punishment in the box.I just can never stand it to see how much teamwork and brilliant tactics go into scoring a single goal  or more often just to get into a position to take a shot the goalie has to defend. Thats the beautiful game when I watch that. But then theres a random slip or extra oomph on a charge by a player not even directly related to the action and bam  because it was in the box and not anywhere else on the pitch  the entire match is decided on that.,SoccerNoobs,ddmwwx4,5,t5_326cz
11065599,0,t1_dele7g0,It is actually possible. The offside rule doesnt stop with the goal line so if an attacking player stands past the goal line when the corner is taken would be offside if there where not for that exception. Also corners are not always taken from the literal corner but from the m quarter circle out which also might put attacking players offside. My guess is the exception is there to avoid having to judge in the messy situation that would create and that the intention for why the offside rule exist isnt applicable to corner situations.,SoccerNoobs,dem9x0q,3,t5_326cz
