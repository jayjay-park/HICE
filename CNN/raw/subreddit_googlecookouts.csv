2650646,0,t3_2qb8ys,Hello Im zak. I cook everything breakfastrelated. French toast? Hell yeah. Pancakes? Definitely. Waffles? Sure man. I can teach all yall how to make some really good breakfast foods from scratch or how to spice up your packaged mixes. I have school on most weekdays but I can do weekends.,googlecookouts,cn4kjsy,3,t5_35k00
2672649,0,t3_2qb8ys,Hi Im Grace.  Im a little late to the party...but I know the basics of cooking.  I can make simple meals as Im living on my own at the moment.  Im definitely a better baker but everything I bake is from Googling recipes nothing original.  I do know a lot of baking tips though. This sounds like fun!,googlecookouts,cn7frtn,1,t5_35k00
