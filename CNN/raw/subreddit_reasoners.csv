I heard that switching up the operators waves other than sine can give some interesting sounds but with FM synthesis its really touchy and there is pretty much no method to creating a specific patch like one you heard on the radio like there is with regular synthesis. Playing around with the octaves wave shapes detuning pitch bending distortion and filters is what gives you the sound. Like I said Im really not that into Dubstep or hardcore EDM so this patch could very well suck but tell me what you guys think about it. However I know for a fact that its not so much the patch that matters but how the modulation of various parameters fits into the song.

4555910,0,t1_ct3oj5n,Well hey if youre looking for some constructive criticism Ill try to offer some. Just remember Ive never attempted music in this style  manner you have. Sure Ive made some downtempo  electro tracks but nothing like this.Ill start with thisThe sounds youre using drums synths samples etc... did you create them yourself or are they presets  stock Reason sounds? Ive found that in this day and age its so accessible for people to make electronic music that the average user cant really appreciate what a beast theyre wielding.For example I design all my own synths. That doesnt mean theyre good or that Im better than you I went to school for audio engineering so Im pretty familiar with the scientific workings of synthesis and able to utilize that to shape them to the sound Im looking for. My synth sounds are always unique but again that doesnt mean theyre good P.The same goes for drum sounds. Reason has great drum sounds but Ive never used any of their preset kits. Ill stepsequence a basic drum pattern and then dive into the folders looking for samples until I find something I think I might be able to shape into the sounds Im looking for. Often times Ill layer two  three samples into one Kong hit with each sample filtered into a different sonic zone. For sample Ill use two kick drums. One will have a LPF that cuts off at around lets say Hz for that nice low A. Then on top of that Ill have a different kick with a bandpass filter around   Hz for that nice midrange hit that the actual kickdrum beater would make if it were a real kit.Again this doesnt mean its good. This is just alchemy.Heres what Im getting atYouve got your own sound  feel for your music but if by chance you find yourself using a lot of presets  Try designing your own stuff Id suggest reverseengineering some presets youre familiar with. That will help you to refine your sound as the instruments youre using have all been handcrafted by you from scratch but it will also help you develop your understanding of the scientific end of music.In the event you answered No to my original question on whether or not you use presets  I apologize if you read all this bullshit.Anyway just some food for thought. Still dig the track though dawg not shitting on your beats any time soon P,reasoners,ct4w5md,1,t5_2rdm9

Im not sure Id want to add another synth but I have thought about adding some more background noise environmental effects like a train pulling through or even just some vinyl popping.I think the second kick that comes in around a minute is actually supposed to sound like that. I wanted it to sound like a footwork kick like this minus the extra low end But if youre hearing something Im missing let me know.Really thanks again for the great feedback!edit aaw man youre totally right. it could use another synth.,reasoners,cta8g7o,1,t5_2rdm9

4897987,0,t3_3hytzq,use a subtractor osc   sine wave put at desired octave.set the mod envelope to affect the pitch of osc  maybe put it around     attack    decay very short  ms perhaps?    sustain      release  amp envelope    attack   or just barely above  to get rid of clicking noise    decay play around    sustain  play around    release  play aroundso the quick pitch modulation is going to give you a really nice attackclick of your drum for me this is really the source of the percussive sound. The rest of the drums character will come from the amp envelope. The attack parameter can be used to choke out the click from the pitch modulation if it is too aggressive. Decay and sustain are really going to help you craft the fundamental note of the drum sorry i cant be any more descriptive than this but play around with those two parameters preferably while the release is relatively short the release is just going to lengthen everything. So if you want some trap style long kick drums you can really let the release go long just make sure to set the polyphony to .after you have all this going on you can put a scream on it i prefer tube or tape distortion youll get some harmonics on it and make it a little bit more audible in the mid range if you wantI use this set up for bass lines but I think that it will really translate well into a synthesized kick drum let me know how it turnswhat you do to it!!!,reasoners,cubxhpo,3,t5_2rdm9

5240585,0,t3_3mrp8q,Okay let me ask you this question does your song currently sound good with the MClass Compressor and Maximizer bypassed? how does it compare to professional songs of this genre with their volume turned down?If the answer is that your song doesnt sound good then its a problem with your mixing.  Try more careful EQing etc. perhaps add subtle sidechain compression e.g. sidechain to the kick with quick attack and release and only a few dB of gain reduction at max  If you have access to the SSL Mixer and especially if you have access to the Spectrum Analyzer Id strongly recommend you use that to mix your tracks its EQ is a lot more useful for mixing you can highcutlowcut and also notch out frequencies.If the answer is that your song sounds good then the problem lies in the mastering.  Frankly its been a while since Ive mastered any song in Reason the MClass plugins just arent good enough for modern electronic music the Compressor doesnt support lookahead and the Maximizer doesnt actually hit .dB peak unless youre clipping the output.  Some of the newer REs might do the job but I havent really sat down with them.  For what its worth Ive been using TRacks standalone just for my mastering and its working out pretty well.

Take a tiny bit of low end off the bass and a bit more from the kick to separate them a little frequency wise you dont need a deep thump with a bass like that to carry the track. A bit more sparkle to the upper mids.Dont know your mastering chain but a play about with Audiomatic can give nice results if used subtly softtube saturation knob is good for a bit of drive and at the end of the chain Ozone Maximizer or other finishing REs.  ,reasoners,cwpi33z,1,t5_2rdm9

7504387,0,t3_4i27jz,Reason is great for mixing since they upgraded to the SSL board.  The workflow is a little different from regular DAWs though.Its worth mixing a few tunes in Reason just to see how it differs from other platforms.

8204764,0,t3_4rph4d,You wont have many problems creating this. Arduino have a limited number of interface pins so depending on the number of buttons  leds you will probably need a multiplexer like CD.To interface with the computer you can use some analog pins to sendreceive MIDI messages look  or use HIDUINO to convert its USB port into a class compliant device you will loose the ability to program it over USB tho.After creating the hardware you make the arduino program that will send CCs or notes over a MIDI channel to Reason. You will probably need to create a Remote to accept your messages in Reason.Seems like a lot of work but this things are fun if you have time. If you dont there are a lot of MIDI controllers that already do this probebly for less money Carlos,reasoners,d535etd,3,t5_2rdm9

As for no sound when clicking in the rack that happens to me to.

Youre going to have to be learning how to use the interface and youre already familiar with Reason. Reason is SUPER professional thanks to  amp .
