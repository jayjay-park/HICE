7097730,0,t3_4cisag,This is a bill our state sorely needs. Imprisoning nonviolent offenders often turns otherwise functioning members of society into angry isolated and increasingly violent criminals. Those convicted of minor drug crimes should have this opportunity to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society.,ModelMidwesternState,d1kwcgp,3,t5_3bcwk

The only message we got was and I quote check it so when we went to check the chamber everything appeared to be the same since the old vote was deleted entirely and the new vote had the exact same title. We thought we had voted on it already. ,ModelMidwesternState,d24jjs0,1,t5_3bcwk

10195313,0,t1_dbz84if,Again theres no evidence claiming that legalization would drastically decrease use for any drug. Its not going to happen. However the key thing to notice here is that LSD is substantially less harmful than alcohol marijuana tobacco and other drugs. Psychedelics as a group are much less harmful theres a study I cited somewhere here or in the chat that I can show later currently on mobile. Further impure drugs exist with a black market  when sellers are licensed there is no incentive to continue using the impure black market. LSD fueling cartels is a far claim and I find that a bit ridiculous that psychedelics would be the chief method to generate revenue for a gang or cartel that could make more potent drugs that are cheaper to  generate. I think its interesting that you say there is no research on LSD when in fact there is especially by our own military.,ModelMidwesternState,dbzp0ur,1,t5_3bcwk

10613879,0,t3_5ru3ay,This is a terrible shame. As a founding member of the model ACLU I was shocked but not at all surprised to see such a disgusting action from the Attorney General. Whether you agree with our goals or not the ACLU has done a lot of quality work in this states courts and we must operate without needless government meddling.This baseless retaliation against a nonprofit legal organization is extremely distressing and very similar to the actions of totalitarian and undemocratic states. This is a direct threat to everyones civil liberties  to associate freely and to campaign for political causes without government intervention or intimidation.If Governor uExpensiveFoodstuffs claims to oppose this action he should put his power where his mouth is and use his executive actions to immediately rescind this Directive. He should also seriously consider uBmanvs position  a seriously unqualified person for the job engaging in reckless and in some cases illegal activities cannot be allowed to continue.uBmanv who is complaining to your office concerning the financial status of our organization? What illegal activities have we committed?SincerelyurealnyebevanSenator Socialist  Atlantic CommonwealthCofounder Model American Civil Liberties Union,ModelMidwesternState,ddaqof3,3,t5_3bcwk
