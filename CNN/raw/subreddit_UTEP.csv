9409377,0,t1_d98moib,UTEP has always been pretty bad about parking. Free parking is going to require walking a bit. If you get out there early enough you can park around Mundy Park and on some streets in Sunset Heights but a lot of those streets have residential parking restrictions so that can be a hassle. You can often find parking around Stanton and further West around Kerbey University Campbell Virginia etc. or if you are really having problems you can also find street parking south of Schuster and west of Stanton. The big thing is to make sure that there arent any no parking signs telling you that you need a certain color permit to park there during the weekday. The city is fairly good about making sure those are up before they give tickets so its up to you to make sure you only park on streets that dont have those. Dont just assume you can park in one area because you see other people parking there.,UTEP,d98pddt,2,t5_2sp9g
