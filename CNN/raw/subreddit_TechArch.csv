10968965,0,t1_debcs12,I disagree with you when you say Architecture has absolutely nothing to do with Lean or Agile. of course DFor me Architecture is about the foundations of a project. So when u define something as simple as coding standards that is part of what architecture delivers. That will avoid useless discussions within the team about spaces or tabs and that is Lean that is efficiency. Thats how I think Architecture links with Lean. My point is NOT that we should think of Architecture as something we MUST force to be lean my point is more that Architecture has Lean characteristics and by understanding the inherent relations we can build on that knowledge to make better Architecture an Architecture that makes easier to build functionality.About statement early in the article saying that principles are always the same I say no such thing. I say Architecture is about those things I dont say its not about other things as well.I cant watch the video u posted now but I will take a look later.Tkx for your feedback. ,TechArch,debddfb,1,t5_2zeh0
