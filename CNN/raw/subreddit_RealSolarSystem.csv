148940,0,t3_1vsb8z,I think your satellite doesnt have the proper blend of LiquidFuel and Oxidizer in it at least according to the resource panel in the last few images.  Other than that it looks awesome I wouldnt have thought of using the conic stretchies to make the ovoid tank.Thats also quite an overpowered upper stage youve got there TWR of greater than  right after lighting it?

3305971,0,t3_2xxnl5,There is a reason no one in real life has made a serious SSTO attempt it is too difficult.  The basic rocket equation drives the relationship that for every doubling of deltaV you quadruple the mass.  Thus you need more airbreathing engines thus more weight thus even more wing thus more weight and drag thus more engine  . . . . . . Here is a search for SSTO in the rRealSolarSystem thread not too much success in RSS either.If you can pull it off then great!

5995227,0,t3_3xkik9,I had to do this for Uchinoura JP. Take a look at the LaunchSites.cfg in the RSS folder. Im not at my computer right now so I dont remember exactly what the options are but theres two numbers I changed to fix it. One was the altitude and the other was like a SphereOffset number. One of them is always  more than the other. Google for a altitude map and enter the longitude and latitude for your site then change the cfg accordingly. My game took entirely too long to boot for me to be bothered with figuring out which one is the problem. Also theres a ResetToSphereSurface or something like that. Ive had mixed results turning it to true. Unfortunately youll have to do t this every time CKAN updates RSS.

7599834,0,t3_4jea8m,The low S TWR just means long burn times. One common technique is known as circularization after apoapsis and its exactly as it sounds. It amounts to getting a somewhat higher apoapsis than desired orbit then burning with a slight radial component to have neutralized it by the time the burn is finished. It does require a steeper trajectory and slightly higher gravity and other losses but its usually not much of a big deal theyre quite small even compared to the loss implied by adding a second engine to increase TWR. ,RealSolarSystem,d362a00,2,t5_2zc1n
