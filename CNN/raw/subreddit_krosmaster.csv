I hadnt seen blind boxes before either. I called my home town retailers and they wont be carrying the game anymore. ,krosmaster,cpxet78,1,t5_2x3qb

Ayan with stasis crystal is  damage. Ayan with pyro buff is . Look up the worlds teams to get an idea of the meta. Have fun!,krosmaster,crxsknx,1,t5_2x3qb
4484478,0,t3_3ci835,Djual switches wounds with his target. The secondary effect applies before the damage. So if Djual has zero wounds and hits a Katar with  wounds. Djual will have four wounds then Katar will have zero. Then Djual  attempt attack Katar for  neutral damage. Djual is good to load up with damage and switch with an enemy heal up your guys and instagib a low hp char like Fern or Vlads  flame shock target. Plus he doesnt give your opponent a GG which is very powerful.,krosmaster,csvxlz2,1,t5_2x3qb

I bought the game a couple of months ago amp unfortunately dont play all that frequently... Dont get me wrong I love it but not ready to spend a lot more money just yet!  Eventually yes and Ive definitely done some window shopping on expansions that Id like to get... some day!,krosmaster,cuimpgb,1,t5_2x3qb
