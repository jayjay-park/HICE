All the marrow is gone by now but I just mix peanut butter and a little crumbled up treat and refill it. She loves it. Well worth the investment because it is restuffable.

375444,0,t3_1ybd7q,Check ropendogtraining or rbalancedtraining. rdogtraining is kind of a pure positive circlejerk.Refeeding has to be done slowly. Im sure your vet has already told you this but if the dog is emaciated and hasnt eaten in a week you need to feed small portions of nottoorich food often throughout the day. Also refer to the dog by its gender please calling it it is so impersonal. ,siberianhusky,cfjohp9,2,t5_2suoy
390320,0,t1_cfktq0n,Thanks the only reason I asked about the packleader thing here is because The Husky rescue coordinator that visited our home gave us this to doPut him in a cratecage in the middle of the room and let you other dog my Basset smelllook around and get use to him.

459673,0,t3_1y5jag,Bike riding as suggested as above and perhaps take the dog to doggie day care? Or hire a dog walker to take him out a few times a week. In fact see if you know someone whos a fellow runner and see if they would like to! Probably cheaper that way.,siberianhusky,cfsij50,1,t5_2suoy

3884732,0,t3_34wtun,My husky Korra seems to be a bit of an exception when it comes to most behaviors typical to the breed.  Shes  months old and while she is furry ball of energy she isnt very destructive towards our possessions but she goes through toys like crazy!  Shes only chewed through an ethernet cable and a phone charger since we got her. If you want to keep destruction to a minimum make sure heshe has lots of toys to play with.  If you only have two or three they may get bored and move on to chewing your pillows.  Due to my wife and Is work schedules she goes to doggie day care twice a week which tires her out very well!  I drop her off around  and pick her up around  and when she gets home she goes right to sleep!  Its the best!  The other days Im home for a few hours in the morning so we go for long walks or runs to get her nice and tired for when I go to work.  They do shed a lot so be prepared to either vacuum everyday or shell out for a roomba model that can handle pet fur.  We have a  that does the trick pretty well!  Someone else mentioned having multiple huskies and Im inclined to agree.  They do not like to be left alone because they are pack animals.  Luckily we have another dog Bogey who keeps her company when we leave the house.  All this being said they are wonderful pets! My experience has shown me that they can make great family pets if they are taught to be so and they are extremely loving when they are shown love in return.  Best of luck and I hope youre happy with whatever choice you make!,siberianhusky,cqz3ct7,2,t5_2suoy

5446677,0,t3_39nvxo,I know this is  months old now but thought Id share my story.  At our old house we had a cable run between a tree in the corner in the yard and the house so he could run some since we didnt have a fence yet.  I never let him outside on his run unless Im out there with him either doing yard work or just playing.Anyways one day I had him on his run while I was cleaning up the yard and I had gone around the corner of the house to throw away some stuff in the trash bins and when I came back around the corner someone a was parked in our yard one guy was in the car and it was still running the other guy had gotten out and was on his way to my husky at this time he was only about  months old.  As soon as I saw them I yelled and ran in their direction the guy out of the car paniced and ran to the passenger seat and they peeled out and took off down the road.  I checked for plates but they had removed their license plates.TLDR  People will try to steal a husky puppies especially,siberianhusky,cw7v652,1,t5_2suoy
5506986,0,t3_3qgwaw,Be VERY careful with marrow bones.  I work in the vet industry and those things get trapped around dogs lower jaws way more often than you would believe.  Like this.It can permanently damage teeth jaw bones the tongue and gums.  The vet almost always has to put the dog to sleep and use a bone saw to remove it.,siberianhusky,cwfkgpp,2,t5_2suoy

Mostly while I dont own my own dog I have spent years looking after my grandpas dogs. I dont believe in punishment just positive reinforcement. It always works.

7880509,0,t3_4n7eeu,My husky has the same scar just above her nose from crawling underneath a fence and cutting her nose open.  So keep in mind he is probably an escape artist also a big trait for the breed.  His ears look a little GSD but his coat looks just regular shorter haired husky to me mine has the same.
