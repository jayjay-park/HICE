1079899,0,t1_chqna1b,Right now Im lvl  with Pow  Spd  Vit  Int  and Luk . I beat him when my Spd was closer to  and after beating him Ive been using a  build so subtracting roughly  from everything would be my stats when I beat him. As for equipment I used LeekRockarmrCannibis since he was weak to Earth. I think ReaperGorearmrHandsel would be good too but youd need a lot more HP since he hits LIGHT,MinuteQuest,chr1cyp,1,t5_31tal

2984240,0,t1_co79688,The chance is low and from my observation it is affected by how many hp left how many times it triggers already and maybe how hard the hit is. I died without triggering guts even once for at least  times but often guts is triggered  times before it fails.,MinuteQuest,co7baxo,1,t5_31tal

5600634,0,t1_cwr9vgd,Wait are you going for k too?If thats the case Id rather not pursue this anymore lolAlso I think luck may affect evasion a bit?  With my Feng Shui set I am getting quite a few dodges.  And I have  speed.  P.S. how is it with that much luck?  I presume with that much luck you have amazing drops. ,MinuteQuest,cwrb92o,1,t5_31tal
