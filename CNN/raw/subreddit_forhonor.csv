Why are the Samurai even there?The Vikings were highly regarded by the Byzantine empire in the Varangian guard and were a major problem for several European kingdoms. Hell they sacked Paris and conquered half of Great Britain while establishing one of the most powerful european kingdoms of the day Kievan Rus. Thats far more than the Samurai ever did. So no they didnt lose the vast majority of their battles and they killed plenty of soldiers and accomplished a great deal beyond their borders. Their time came and went just like the European Knight and Samurai. Whats more important for the game is that they are well known and fit into this sort of game rather well.,forhonor,cvhozpy,11,t5_38p4n

8717048,0,t3_4zai7t,Its tough to make good DLC for games that are so multiplayer focused like for honor. Maps tend to fracture the player base as not everyone is going to buy the DLC so your player base will be split in matchmaking. COD gets around this issue by having such a massive player base that it simply doesnt matter. More classes work well but thatll be difficult to balance. Theres cosmetics but that doesnt really change the core game play experience so it is more likely to get stale over time. Id love to see DLC that layered a meta game on top of the existing multiplayer. Adding territories or regions that the different factions can fight over. The core game would be the same for people who dont buy the DLC. But for the people that do itll give them more reason to jump in and play more often. ,forhonor,d6v9qcs,3,t5_38p4n
8773195,0,t1_d7293wv,Yes everyone whos played the technical tests and events and got back to us on the forums has been saying that the game seems not too complicated on the surface but when youre in control theres a lot to think about and a lot of options for your next move.

8947373,0,t3_52tqyx,I find it very disconcerting that the Revenge mechanic is active in Duel. It was added to the game specifically to address concerns that fighting against multiple opponents was basically impossible. The overall impact of Revenge on an unfair situation is questionable on its own but the ability to use it in a Duel not only goes against the purpose of the mechanic but also adds yet another element of imbalance to the game. I suppose its a little too early to make a firm conclusion but I have a feeling that it will be a problem in the future. I vote to leave it out of Duel entirely.As far as the game modes available they are all essentially just variants of the same thing Deathmatch. Aside from Dominion all of the game modes focus around fighting with no primary objectives otherwise. There is no King of the Hill no Capture the Flag no Siege mode. Basically nothing interesting to set the modes apart from each other besides from the number of players present and a few small mechanical changes like Feats Reviving and respawns being turned on or off.Im also a bit concerned about the number of maps that will be available in the final game. Weve only seen three of them so far and yet they are stretching out the content by using the same maps for every game mode. Duel for instance just takes place on small enclosed areas within Dominion maps rather than having their own custom made locales. They didnt even add any new maps to the current alpha instead using the same three that weve already seen a hundred times since the game was revealed ages ago. This makes me feel that they are most likely only going to have around  to  maps total that are used for everything which will get old really fast. I suppose from their perspective they probably think of this modular map design as efficient but being a pessimist it kind of just comes off as laziness to me. There was a time where every multiplayer game had tons of unique maps for every game mode and every game mode was unique in itself. And all of that was present at launch for free with no strings attached. I guess those days are long gone. Im trying to remain positive and optimistic but given Ubisofts track record and the most common trends among develops in the modern game industry we can probably expect them to sell maps and game modes for DLC. Knowing Ubisoft they will make every effort to nickel and dime their players as much as possible and then promptly abandon the game after a year or two. I really hope not but Im not holding my breath. High expectations only leads to disappointment. We should always er on the side of caution.,forhonor,d7ncbrf,1,t5_38p4n

8992451,0,t3_53erjk,The customization was alright. It need to be purely cosmetic though. In a game about dueling and taking advantage of your opponent this undermines it by adding stats. Combat should be skill based. Animations and graphics were great. Everything was fluid and felt meaty. Loved every second I was in combat. Class balance was alright. The only glaring need to tweaking was the Orochi imo. My main gripe is what has been repeated over and over but Ill say it again. Its the PP. Im hoping theyre saving money and going PP for alpha and beta while getting servers for launch. I was disconnected so many times it almost made me fall out of love with the game.

9006580,0,t1_d7u4rl1,Was sort of being facetious but I thought Id try and get the conversation started that way. I certainly dont need to know! That being said while the samurai did often decapitate they were very respectful of the dead and if the opponent was honorable especially so. I doubt they would have claimed the head as a trophy. Vikings however used fear to intimidate their enemies and it seems very reasonable for them to have gone the head on a stake route. ,forhonor,d7ug7ma,1,t5_38p4n

9015820,0,t1_d4d37xr,Same. I might even wait a month or two after the release just to see whether or not ubi releases PW content or fractures the playerbase via paid for map pack or paid for game mode that splits up the players more. I live in Australia so the game is even more expensivethe playerbase is shithouse small one DLC paid map pack is enough to completely destroy the multiplayer of any Australian player base that isnt call of duty large and even then sometimes it does anyway.

9032831,1,t1_d7xldeh,for funsies... it clearly triggers some people.But on a serious note people here act as if dedicated servers would fix ALL problems and are completely failproof.

9039800,0,t1_d7y3a2h,I think the reason people are so against PP is because the other popular medieval style fighting game is the Souls series and youre always at the mercy of the host. From Demons Souls to Dark Souls  it was always a dice shoot as to whether or not you were going to fight someone who wasnt hitting you from  feet away with their  foot sword or you having all of your swings phase right through them.I heard Dark Souls  had dedicated servers and that game felt much much smoother albeit still with problems. Then again it could have also been however they handled their netcode or whatever programming is used to make online less laggy.,forhonor,d7yfuzp,2,t5_38p4n

9055548,0,t3_54b2dl,I think an often overlooked strength of the wardens shoulder bash is they ability to charge it and use it as a gap closer. Holding the move mid combo can be an effective way to react to evasive dodgers and maintain close proximity.

9150912,0,t3_55l32c,No not at all. v in current build is weighted towards a certain couple of classes. Whereas you can truly get a mixture of characters in a team comp do to featsperk system. The true question is what do they add to give more of a tactical style gameplay. Currently its favored for just running around and killing enemy team. If thats what they wanted they should have just made it an arena fighter. So Im interested to see where they take it on the last legs of development.,forhonor,d8by0ci,0,t5_38p4n

This includes any objects the player interacts with the character model the animations all the effects such as fire smoke ect all from different angles in real time. Its not impossible to fix but it would take too long for them to optimize and make it so it run as smoothly as without.

9602628,0,t1_d9wprjp,The issue that is generally faced when fighting good Wardens or Conquerors is that they will shoulder charge you and immediatly follow up with a light attack then follow up with another charge so on and so forth. The move isnt that hard to handle if they do it once but when they spam the ability it becomes pretty ridiculous.

9875114,0,t3_5gj0ho,I will not really be all that nice when writing this just a heads up.Berserker is in my opinion one of the damn strongest characters in the game. I am honestly quite disappointed in most people playing the character. Its an awesome character with quite the boring moveset with mostly overhead attacks. Dauntless is fun but its a noobcrusher.Its kinda sad to see the low winrate but it doesnt surprise me at all when most people didnt even care to look beyond the broken deflect mechanic which gave atleast some people a few wins. Yay for them. The people who relied all too much on deflect will be crushed once it gets fixed and probably made harder to use. The character seemed pretty boring when most of the things people saw was far from its true potential.Most of the stories you hear about Zerks are the ones just camping near a ledge.

9969508,0,t1_db71xd2,Shugoki well actual kanabo were only about  lbs so he should not be having as laborious a job swinging that thing as he seems to.  But hes obviously being based off of legends where Oni could carry kanabo that were  lbs or heavier.  My gut wants me to say that the obvious gaps in his armor would normally either not be there or be filled with something but I dont know as much about Japanese armor.Nobushi Dont know why she has a farmers hat.  Seems kind of pointless.  But skipping over armor because again not what I know.  Female samurai that used a naginata existed.  They were called Onnabugeisha and yeah they werent forced to use a naginata but that was the weapon they are most commonly portrayed with.Thats the big points mostly.  The game is not trying to be realistic.  It drew from unarmored medieval fighting and made a bunch of technical changes to make the game feel more like a fighting game.  Then sort of went with their own art style that drew from history or at least the popular view of history in the case of the vikings but never let history get in the way they wanted to do things.Which I think is a fine approach. If this was a historical game it would play like thisWhat armor do you have?  Is it a Conquerors set or a Lawbringers set?  If you answered Yes then the only weapons on the battlefield that can even damage you are the Conquerors flail the Lawbringers poleaxe and Shugokis kanabo.  Everyone else is your bitch.  Enjoy murdering them.Edit So just watched some gameplay and heres a new complaint.  The Valkyries spear is short very short.

Played the Raider for a bit but it feels like you barely have time to get a light attack off a GB let alone after a parry.I feel like theres a game here but the systems are so opaque and the feedback is so inconsistent that its hard to tell when Im doing something right. For example I tried fighting a level  bot to see what the class was capable of. I kept falling over and I didnt know why. On top of that stamina only gets explained in the loading tips AFAIK.Its frustrating because I can see a lot of potential in the game.

10048922,0,t1_dbhcus2,Yes it totally is regardless of what you think its terminology.Also its not simply for security purposes. PeerPeer connections are very often terrible. ISPs dont have great routing between clients they have a lot better routing tables in regards to large hosting solutions around the globe. Hence having a middleman that is located in a good location between the users makes it a better experience. Also its not a proxy its called a TURN server. And its considered a dedicated server solution if they do end up going that route.Simple fact is that is considered a dedicated server solution. There is a dedicated server inbetween the clients.No a peerpeer network does not need to be each client updating each one another it simply the notation that there is no dedicated hosting solution between the clients. Its not peerpeerpeerpeer.Regarding tickrates you clearly have no idea what you are talking about so im not going to waste my time explaining to you why hz is terrible for online play and how it adds addition delay.,forhonor,dbheey2,3,t5_38p4n

10051086,0,t1_dbhnj3a,My point is you have to understand where developers are coming from. They cant do everything. Making a new IP is risky and paying for things like dedicated servers is even more risky on a new IP. Of course not everyone is going to love a project theyre working on but that doesnt mean they want to see it fail. Also no one is blaming it all on Publishers lol. But for big companies like EA for example working with a Publisher can be a difficult thing and just another challenge for game devs. Personally im just tired of how gamers act in the wake of development news. Especially since a lot are just headline readers and refuse to do any actual research of their own or try to understand why things turn out the way they do. ,forhonor,dbhok4e,2,t5_38p4n

10108097,0,t1_dboxk2f,gtIs this concept common? Yes kinda its called NAT Punchthrough Valve has it on all of their steamworks enabled games for developers to use.  Granted if enabled they dont pick bad connection or good connection they just use it across the board.  This isnt exactly the same as offering both peer to peer and dedicated hosting though.Blizzard also offers routed peer to peer which is very similar to NAT punchthrough but instead of punchthrough all pp traffic goes to the main server and is then distributed by them.  This lessens upload bandwidth strain.But offering routed pp for poor connections would be my implementation but allowing players with good connections to skip the routing server.  Routed pp inherently also contains NAT punchthrough due to not needing to communicate with peers.gtDo any games actually treat bad connection players differently in network code?Blizzard didor still does dont know SC with WarCraft  amp .  Slower players were dismissed in update ticks and if you consistently dropped packetswere slow to update you were given fewer updates.  I believe this was dropped from battle.net games either right after or some time after The Frozen Throne came out.  LAN never had this feature.SCBrood War would send updates twice or more each time to players who had repeated dropped packets sending them in bulk in attempt to get one to them.  This was phased out around the same time as WCs my guess would be because it hurt more than it helped.Halo did in CEpc dont know about consoles with how often you updated.  Slower players had lower tickrates but host had final say between two peers so it wasnt an advantage to update slower.  This wasnt automatic based on connection but rather was based purely on which internet speed you toggled in the settings.  Hosts in CE had the ability to override this dont recall in Halo .Im sure theres other games in the last  years that did it but its been extremely uncommon.  Maybe a handful of games ever.,forhonor,dbp3gyx,1,t5_38p4n

Thats how I see it anyway.,forhonor,dcis7w8,1,t5_38p4n

10367267,0,t1_dcj6sa5,That might be a tough change but I think it would help.My biggest issue is that then feinting becomes extremely powerful.  It does increase the necessary reaction speed required of all players but then players like myself who utilize feints could simply walk all over people who dont. Its not a bad idea but right now feints do work well especially if you are doing proper mixups etc. I think my biggest thing is that aggressive players may need more options to deal with defensive players as defensive players have all the options right now. ,forhonor,dcj6x6b,3,t5_38p4n

10388381,0,t1_dcljg3o,I think Ubisoft has some games that are just riskierniche titles that they will not back with big ad campaigns or even space like in the Uplay launcher. There is a cost to advertising it on Uplay opportunity cost. Every ad you see for FH is an ad you dont see for assassins creed. They know where their money comes from.Lets put it this way. They are already taking a huge risk by making these niche games like FH and RSiege. Games are a huge financial investment. They have decided to give these designers a chance to chase their vision and actually give them the time and budget to deliver a good product. That alone should be commended. The lack of ad campaign looks like a lack of support but if you had  million to spend on FH number pulled out of my ass if you wanted to make it the best game possible you wouldnt spend  million on ads like they do with AC.I think what Ubisoft is doing is smart. They are giving their creators enough money to make the game and thinking if its good enough the money will come. It worked with RSiege and I think it will work here.When FH comes around if it was successful you can probably expect some actual adspace devoted to it.,forhonor,dcll6e5,2,t5_38p4n

10470606,0,t3_5pyp03,There are crossbows longbows kunai and maybe some others for other classes but the bows are all single shot incredibly high damage skills with long cooldowns. I feel like if there were a true ranged class however it might take away from the focus of the game. Archers are like the sniper class of many games  there are usually too many on the team when there are no limits to be effective at playing the objective. Not to mention that the slower paced lock on combat of the game would mean archers would probably have a lot more time to shoot people who are busy fighting others ruining the fun of those involved.,forhonor,dcuy8hu,1,t5_38p4n

10489543,0,t3_5q2o9o,Just give the copy of the beta folder to your friend the next he should do is . Login to uplay. Select For Honor beta in his games list. Start downloading the game select the location where you want to store it and etc.. After the download starts pause it. Close uplay exit from it completely. Then he should copy the game client that you gave him to the exact location that you selected in action  for example you selected location games there you will find folder created by uplay called ForHonorBETA. If your client is copied as a whole folder ForHonorBETA then delete the folder that was created by uplay and replace it by the client you gave him the point is that there should not be anything like gameForHonorBETAForHonorBETA or game game files that were inside ForHonorBETA and etc.It HAS TO BE just like uplay created gameForHonorBETA game files. Login to uplay after successful login you should see notification on bottom right of the screen that says download complete. Select For honor in your game list there you should see that preload button became preloaded and grayed out. Select PropertiesgtLocal filesgtVerify files. Just in case if something went wrong during copying. If everything is ok the process will complete without additional downloads.. Wait for the start of the beta preloaded button will become play or something like this.Good luck at the battlefield,forhonor,dcx3lmz,2,t5_38p4n

10493840,0,t3_5q8ar7,What youre suggesting would be a great idea if this was a realistic medieval combat simulator. Viking shields for instance were known to break with some frequency. But I think it wont work for this game. Particularly Dominion as the characters are balanced around using all their abilities in conjunction and a Conqueror or Warlord that cant use their shield bash or go into their block everything stance and exiting it for a special attack in the Warlords case suddenly have a severe disadvantage that other classes will never have to deal with. Likely this will just result in them suiciding once their shield breaks which is just an annoyance that takes them out of gameplay rather than adding tactical depth. I really wouldnt worry too much about shields. Really theyre just normal blocking with some slight benefits. As a way to differentiate the different defenses of the classes. ,forhonor,dcxl4xj,3,t5_38p4n

It will take time to learn and more time to master and that wont be for everyone.

10505829,0,t1_dcycwye,Many samurai adhered to the discipline of bushido but the best way to sum them up is as very similar to the knight class in the west landowning lords that take up arms for their leader. Bushido and the western definition of honorchivalry diverge at several places however. Theyre a bit romanticized by westerners but moreso by the kind of people whove never really had a runin with an actual Japanese person or and think that samurai are just better or just want to sell movie tickets. for the record Im heavily mixed but a heavy chunk of that is Japanese along with much of my cultural upbringing,forhonor,dcyy40c,1,t5_38p4n

10509355,0,t1_dcz9iz6,Warden has been my goto character thus far in the game. I havent tried playing any of the other characters so my view points are biased. I actually feel that the assassin classes do much better in v situations. My reasoning is that if you find yourself against a team of  assassins   orochi and  berserker in my case they just have to run in s and they will dominate any team. No individual player can block their attacks. But uicantseeyoucantseeme you have a team that can also fight true but no one can catch the assassins any time one gets focused they run around and sneak more attacks on the one player thats being focused. Rinse and repeat and you have an extremely effective team that can only be countered with another team of assassins. So where does that leave you as a non assassin hero? I can win v with any of them if I ever catch them. But not when they mob spam your team to death. That would be my biggest complaint with the game. Its the same reason overwatch put caps on duplicate heros on the same team. Its just not fun getting weeb sliced to death from the enemy that you cant focus. ,forhonor,dczchwl,1,t5_38p4n

10514920,0,t1_dczxs6w,Use your movement skills to your advantage. I swear much like Kensei that dash forward attack has some insane reach. It helps you get in and close the gap.Dont always go for the standard guard break follow up try to mix it up a bit. Also watch your stamina your big combos take up a lot of it. Back off after significant damage and let the bleed do its work.Cancel your heavies! You can cancel the start up of any heavy with either a riposting stab although this can be blocked a dodge either into a deflect or dodge attack or a guard break. Except for dodge heaviesYou can do a riposting stab after any heavy attack this includes your dodge attacks. Press light attack as soon as the attack lands. This attack is a guaranteed hit. This also goes for the stab guard break combo as well. Dont spam the button it wont work.Oh yeah and dont forget to parry. You can usually follow it up with a forward dash or a heavy attackheavy attack feint into a riposting stab. ,forhonor,dczz8s2,16,t5_38p4n

On the other hand i dont really understand why anyone would deflect in the first place sure style points and the heavy counterattack chunks but no one would let you actually hit them with that. From a parry you can guardbreak into a heavy combo which is easier to pull of and has a much higher reward for lower risk. Orochi could use some rebalancing maybe buffing his deflect back to some extent and taking some power from elsewhere like his pretty obnoxious top light combo.,forhonor,dd1t1x9,1,t5_38p4n

10547237,0,t1_dd3e9mk,Eh from what I gather devs focus on getting people matches ASAP because if a player waits more than one minute they declare the game dead and stop playing. This is actually something that has happened in the past Titanfall  has this right now I can always find games at any time of day but because someone waited two minutes for a match it was suddenly ded geam gais and circle jerking about it being empty among many other examples and in recent years games have generally done everything they can to get you a match regardless of quality.I dont like it either Id rather spend an extra minute getting a good quality match than a shit one in  seconds. If Im able to browse menus and customise loadouts during the matchmaking then I see no reason why I need to have instant matchmaking.That said remember that this was a closed beta it is going to have had a far lower pop than it will do at launch.

Most of the people complaining about bad disconnects lag crashes etc on this sub seemed to be on PC. Also the most recent Ubi game with competitive multiplayer that I followed at least was The Division which got hacked to shit on PC but consoles were unaffected.

10556579,0,t3_5r5uw5,gtit is my opinion that assassin classes are at a distinct advantage against heavy classes in one on one combat.Probably because the Assassins are designed to dominate v while the Heavies are designed to survive v. Does that mean Heavies cant beat Assassins in v? No but they will have to work for it.I surprised that you didnt mention the Conquerors ability to attack without interruption. You know if you charge the heavy attack then parry the opponents attack you stop their attack while immediately following throw through with your charged heavy attack similar to the Warlords light attack counter. Incredibly useful in engaging people skilled in defense.gtHis defensive mode is significantly less useful in duels.Not really. Since he can cancel any attack with the defensive mode its a great way to catch the opponent off guard. They try to dodge your heavy attack? Cancel with omniguard for immediate safety. Not sure what theyre going to do as the get close? Omniguard. Dont think you can react in time to stop their bleed combo? Omniguard saves the day again. And since you arent able to attack at all you should have plenty of stamina to block the attacks.gtI had no control over spacing or the pace of the fight. I had no way to engage my enemies.Wrong. You had full control over the engagement. Make the Peacekeeper come to you. Parry their attacks drain their stamina. Or better yet just block the attack and GB them for a free start to your infinite light attack chain. Charge the heavy attack release it then immediately omniguard to stop the attack and block the Peacekeepers faster attacks then guard break them while they recover. Assassins thrive when they can control the speed of the engagement and as the Conqueror you are one of the best classes to slow the combat to a crawl and take the speed away from them.Im guessing you didnt know that you can press the GB button when the Peacekeeper stabs you with her grab to throw her off you or that you could block it by blocking when she stabbed you. Its a nice trick to completely remove their most effective attack from their arsenal.Now Im not saying a skilled PK wont be able to outmaneuver your counter plays but the Conqueror has a plethora of ways to control the engagement and as long as you mix up your moves you can still net yourself a win.,forhonor,dd4phan,3,t5_38p4n

Its very simple to back off let the revenge bar run down a bit then reengage in vv.  If your opponent is fighting super defensively and youre just running into him constantly to give him revenge its on you.  If you dont back off when he revenges or go full defensive when he does to get your OWN revenge thats also on you.Its not broken.  Also saying  win rate in duels in the beta is a joke at least ths of my matches opponents couldnt counter guard breaks.And lastly I give no care to downvotes on a subreddit.

10577215,0,t3_5rg5n4, Orochi is an assassin class Fast hero Very fragile when hit Moderate attack damage.You will need to move a lot wait counterattack retreat and wait again. Use the practice and advanced practice till you get your moves right perform them at will without messing up and start playing some v. This game is all about timing and reaction times. No matter the class you play with or play against.If you choose to play the assassin classes you will have the reflex trait. That means that your block your arrow is same as attacker will only block an attack for a few seconds.This is good because the attacker wont know where you are going to hit them from if you want to attack and not moved your arrow yet.This is bad because the attacker can crush you you are not defending any side until you move your arrow. A combo hit will require you to move your arrow to meet each swing. Dodging and counterattacking is smarter and is how the class should be played.So Orochi has no guard position but can counter attack very quickly. You will need to wait for the enemy swings  patiently  and dodge  parry.If you are guarding with an Orochi your arrow is same as attacker I think it is a mistake and a missed opportunity for an attack.You should always dodge into swings or try to parry hits if you see the opponent not faking attacks consistently. Best tip I can give you is to play all classes in order to understand what you can do with the Orochi and what combos to wait for.But if you see a dummy player just standing around just cycle attacks from all directions. They will panic run and you will sprint slash them in the back.Good luck and happy hunting.,forhonor,dd6ygwj,1,t5_38p4n

The downside is if you fail you will get hit.Deflect as far as I know is limited to assassin characters. It is done by dodging in the direction of the attack. the timing is similar to the parry. The peace keeper can follow up with a quick bleed attack. The Orochi has a stab that does decent damage I believe.If you dodge to fast you just dodge if you dodge to slow you get hit.Another downside to dodgingdeflecting they can guard break you instead of attacking. which puts you in a bad position.If I am not correct please let me know.,forhonor,dd7hpuu,3,t5_38p4n

10583463,0,t1_dd7hb8j,The closest I could imagine is hes slightly mispronouncing Fligo as Fliga which is a verb meaning to beat someonething down. Ive heard people claim he says something before that word which they interprite as Hun or Hur which makes me think hes saying Non Fligo as some weird way of saying You wont beat me down. But he doesnt say Fligo he explicitly says Fliga which is not a Latin word at all and Ive never been able to hear him saying anything before that word in his defensive stance so Im very unsure on that voice line in particular.Another question Ive seen a lot alongside that one is what the peacekeeper says during her deflect attack and I suppose since were talking about it Id like to put my two cents in in the hopes that someone sees it and it sparks an epiphany. It sounds to me like shes saying Timoris torus which isnt even really a sentence since those are two nouns. Timoris would mean fear the noun version of it and torus usually would mean like a cushion or a bed or very rarely I suppose it could mean strength according to some of my friends. I guess that could be some weird way of saying bed of fear or fears strength but that doesnt really work out imo. ,forhonor,dd7lpet,3,t5_38p4n

It has taken the team half a decade to release  new hero. There are  heroes. Ive played about k hours and I estimate that the roster needs to be about  heroes based on the roles and skill sets.THere is a terminal number too many heroes and you have many ambiguous and overlapping roles and classes and things become noticeably generic like LoL.However the more unforgivable slant is too few.For Honors lacking features and the sparse roster included is a major deterrent to buy the game for me at this point,forhonor,dd8aof3,0,t5_38p4n

10595950,0,t1_dd8vzce,They scaled gains based on population so that population difference didnt matter and it was decided mainly by which faction had the best performing players and were smartest with deploying their assets. So if the lowest population faction steamrolled that was because their players performed better than the other factions. And yes having lower pop being better would lead to more balance at release than favouring high pop as favouring high pop would lead to more and more people moving to that faction making it stronger and stronger and causing that faction to fight totally unopposed forever. Whereas with favouring low pop when more people move there they become progressively weaker until you reach an equilibrium. ,forhonor,dd8w2q6,1,t5_38p4n

10616794,0,t3_5rxypu, The entirety of the faction war. It feels vague wasnt explained deploying assets should be saved for later and while I dont mind locked rewards I want locked rewards behind skill if they are anything of worth. Not from a  popularity contest. Plus it just feels like there could be more to the faction war. The Catapult feat seemed too effective compared to other feats. The overwhelming amount of environment hazards in DuelsBrawls is abit silly imo. Not to say Im against having some around... But when you get Sanctuary Bridge going a full match without seeing an environmental kill from my experience was pretty rare. Even against someone who knew how to counter guard break. An ingame explanation of Dominions mechanics maybe I missed them or just was busy talking with people? would be phenomenal.  I learned but twas silly to have to play a ton before realizing what the actual mechanics were. The moveset video should be broken down and gifs added to each move on its own in addition to the overall video. That way someone doesnt have to sit and watch their entire moveset video just to get clarification on one move.Also the reason the game doesnt remember where you deployed last from what I noticed was because whatever mode your playing has a specific region on the map. You get bonuses for deploying to that location. However it DOES show you where you have deployed though.I feel like Im missing things I complained about during the cbt... But I can always add them in if I think of them. All said I love the game and really didnt have too many real complaints. Had plenty of bitches while learning how to play against the characters though lol.,forhonor,ddb1itf,3,t5_38p4n

10621503,0,t1_ddbibig,I know which one you are talking about P but we will need to see what has changed.As for your basic ideas Ill weigh in.gtGet rid of parriesThe main problem imo is that the best option  of the time off a parry is a guard break. Its boring because the best option off a guard break is a throw off a cliff or a heavy or wall throw for a couple classes Give more classes unique parry mechanics kind of like the warlord. It could be damage or utility or specific directions like crushing counter. I wouldnt mind tightening the window either.gtTighten guard break windowI would agree. It would incentivize offense as well because more people would be attempting breaks theyd be harder to defend so players would be tempted to actually swing at each other to discourage the guard break in the first place.gtIncrease Chip Damage and Stamina Drain on HeaviesAbsolutely. Blocking a Dane axe heavy attack should consume an enormous amount of stamina. Not too sure on damage bleedthrough though. One issue is if a player runs out of stamina. Blocking could keep them out of stamina permanently which Im not a fan of. It would also heavily favor assassins with their good dodging skills. Raise the stamina cost of dodging would keep it in check... probably.gtSpeed increaseIm in favor. If some classes are going to have attacks that are nearly unreactable all of them need at least some similar options. Preferably more than one so it doesnt turn into leave your guard on X side against X class and forget about it.One other thing Id like to add.Being out of stamina should greatly hurt all of your defensive options. Dodges should be sluggish and cover less ground Damage should bleed through on heavy attacks when blocked etc.,forhonor,ddbizyj,3,t5_38p4n

Could be wrong but thats what I thought by the video I saw guy didnt use his abilities well.I think raider is fine the way he is. Being able to  shot people with a decent health pool is nice. Sure its predictable most times but I feel some characters have their strengths and weaknesses. The raider to me should be a guaranteed spot on Dom to do some big dmg and overwhelm when its chaotic. His kit rewards hitting the full combos last hit similar to kensei like finishing the blocked combo into an unblockable dealing more dmg. Also you can feint any heavy into something else by hard feinting even go into an unblockable to punish a party or block attempt.  Just my  cents we should wait til metas are established tho. ,forhonor,ddcdpj5,1,t5_38p4n

What are the effects that are considered debuffs? Does it just reduce their duration or their effect also?

10662720,0,t1_ddfrpn4,So far there is no specific lorebased explanation for why heroes can play across factions. From a gameplay perspective it makes much more sense not to limit players in that way. Doing so would inhibit people from playing with their friends if they were in different factions. It would also limit your own ability to play heroes outside of your faction without changing factions which would force you to sacrifice your faction war for the season. Or round. Or turn. I forget how long you are locked in for rewards.I think it plays out pretty well on the battlefield. When it comes to success in team games dominion anyway I have noticed a strong correlation between victory and wise team composition. While there is a lot to be gained from diversifying your heroes there isnt a specific benefit to diversifying them within one faction apart from being more familiar with them I suppose. My most exciting experiences in the second alpha and the closed beta were a result of great team comp and solid communication. So while having a team full of Viking heroes isnt essential I would recommend having a team of different class types. I play Raider so for me this means finding players who are career Warlords or Conquerors as well as Berserkers Orochi or Peacekeepers and Nobushi.The reason why diverse team composition is particularly effective is a result of the way the renown system works. Renown and score closely related but as they influence the victory or loss of a match renown is more important. Renown is gained in different ways for different class types. The short version is that vanguards get more renown for killing soldiers heavies get more renown for defending objectives assassins get more renown for killing players and hybrids get a little bit from doing everything. Its more specific than that but thats the quick version. As you earn renown in a match you unlock feats and your feats can easily influence the course of the game. Additionally increasing renown increases score which increases war assets gained at the end of the match which increases your position in the faction war.So having a diverse team composition allows all of your players to contribute to the score of the team their own personal scores their own renown and their own war asset contributions at the same time. Again however a good team composition can be had without respect to faction.TLDR No lore for faction freedom plays fine.,forhonor,ddfs0zs,1,t5_38p4n

The truth of the matter is if you know when to use an attack it can land. The storm rush is a good attack when you are in the middle of trading blows and you throw it out suddenly obviously its easy to defend when they jump backward and sit there until youre in range.I would often use it in the middle of exchanges when someone throws a heavy. Dodge heavy backward and immediately rush dont hold it. Worked like a charm more often than not even on people who ended up besting me because they were better.,forhonor,ddh3ojz,4,t5_38p4n
10677718,0,t3_5sp7s7,I feel instead of outright nerfing it to how it is now they shouldve just added an increased stamina cost for canceling to maybe  of the stamina bar so it couldnt be spammed like that.I never played the alpha but the current storm rush just feels so useless once you get past the people who dont know how to block. Against anyone even half good its such a telegraphed move that its really easy to blockparry. Since you cant feint it into a guardbreak or an attack from another direction anymore the attack always comes from the direction the sword gets held. You can take this with a grain of salt though because I only played the last two days of the CB and never really got the chance to play with Storm Rush more if it actually is feintable the advanced tutorial showed an Orochi feinting Storm Rush into a guardbreak but I could never pull it off. Cant wait for OB so I can practice some more.The guaranteed deflect on block sounds insanely stupid though and Im glad they changed it to dodge.,forhonor,ddhbqra,6,t5_38p4n

I personally believe that every class should be designed ideally for v fighting excelling against certain fighting styles and weak to others with a few tricks up their sleeves for other situations. The Warden has a good example of what Im talking about their quick sweep attack is good for clearing minions at B point or when facing multiple close opponents but its also effective as a change up when facing a single opponent.

10680359,0,t3_5st3qc,Im quite happy to see many FGC members interested in For Honor. Good fighting game players are excellent at dealing with frustration they dont mind a steep learning curve and as a community they are ravenous when it comes to finding tech and advantages. If this game has the ability to be played at a deeper level if hidden combos techniques or strategies exist at a high level its the FGC members that will find it and abuse it hopefully pushing For Honor towards a fighting game status and potential as an eSport.If on the other hand the game ends up being too shallow and the combat superficial then I think well see most FGC members leave the community myself included. ,forhonor,ddhljin,4,t5_38p4n

It is clunky and very unclear when you are supposed to hit someone and when youre not. Myself I have noticed a lot of times with the Samurai class that my attacks do  damage even though they clearly and visibly connect. Also armor brake attacks sometimes dont work. Specifically before the player attacks a brief second when his weapon is at start or mid his swing or just a second before the player starts his attack. And another thing please drop the its FREE thing. So Im supposed to just take it because its free? Well anywho if you have a problem about people complaining just think that the devs dont. Its useful feedback. And why you would want less feedback when the people who are making the game say they want it is beyond me.Sure some complaints are not useful feedback but a lot of them are.

You find yourself dueling their warden while your friend has his hands full with their peacekeeper for example. Then when you finish off their warden you have a choice. Do you fight the other opponent the peacekeeper or do you wait?You look and realize your friend and the peacekeeper are dueling. They are already learning eachothers patterns. They are already playing mind games on each other. They are measuring their strength. Honor then demands you let the best man win. And this game is about honorable fights right?

Once those become easy go to level . The raider at least the level  bot tends to throw lots of slow heavies and can be a good place to start can also just use the duel practice mode with a lvl  bot for this if you want. Otherwise just go through the classes and work just on defense dont bother with attacking. Once you feel good about blocking attacks start working on parrying.

10741825,0,t1_ddnxlfe,gtI disagree. They add a lot of strategic elements and they mix everything up.There is nothing strategic about pressing a single button to do  of someones HP because you farmed minions for  minutes. There is no counterplay to it. Likewise there is nothing interesting about placng a bleed trap forgetting about it and just picking up a kill for no reason. There is no strategy to a vast majority of the feats. The only thing they do is stop the flow of the game. gtIf someone runs for one chase and punish them.Absolutely moronic. Have you not played Elimination? Sometimes you spawn literally right next to a powerup. There is no counterplay to that. Running into someone with a powerup is suicide. Its simply dictated by where you spawn. gt If youre half paying attention you should be able to get a free hit on them and contest the power up without too many issues.Again really stupid. You can spawn right next to a power up out of sheer luck and it is physically impossible for your opponent to reach you in time. The only correct choice is to give up on the fight and go gank someone else. gtFight around them fight over them guard them. Use them to bait players. All of my elimination games were very active they just werent the usual sit and dance in a circle v. If someone spends that long running around for power ups you should have sufficient time to find someone to gang. Now theyre down  regardless of power ups.Maybe Id be inclined to agree with you more if the gamemode didnt completely depend on a coinflip of who spawned where. ,forhonor,ddnxs22,0,t5_38p4n

It could start by needing to get a bridge lowered for the little soldiers. So all of the attack team have to climb a wall and get to the lever or something like that. Defenders try to stop them. After thats done soldiers advance further into the map and attackers have a new goal. Id also like a faction war mode where you have to play with other players in your faction and have to play characters in your faction. Winners get bonus war assets.

Even if that were the case James Vanderberghe was cited in an interview that player factions with lower populations were automatically compensated in total assets earned making population a non issue. What should be considered if you wanted to draw numbers would be total war assets deployed per faction over the course of the season and compare that to which faction is the victor.

10765928,0,t3_5txbci,What if block an attack consume a little of stamina? You did the effort right? So if the defensive style is predominant right now we need make it costly too. Not so much as an offensive but today if you manage to defend  of everything you build revenge while the enemy waste a lot of stamina and you dont. So I agree with the OP an offensive style need more incentive.I think we need to watch how the fighting games manage this kind of situation and what we have here is very similar. If we make who have more HP at the end of time win things change a little. I dont mind play all the clock with the tension a high level match has. In fact this is nice.In a fighting game you can block all around and as happen here this chop a little bit of HP chip damage if it is a high attack or special. You can do grabs and techs as well. You can feint and do cancels. And all what happen there is a mind game and fast reaction to use any possible window. And we have a lot of that here too.So maybe a little adjust in the stamina for defensive playstyle and the possibility to win by the clock is enough. Because in the end it is all with the players. Watch a Zangief high level gameplay it is defensive.,forhonor,ddqfc2v,1,t5_38p4n

However.. B v really can mess things up when the  is a decent player and gets revenge. It can turn the tide tremendously. So I dont want to be the ass who makes that revenge pop. C I like being the  in v I main a Conq. And its absolute entertainment being able to block hit after hit and find pockets to dish out my own damage.

10775664,0,t1_ddr9uge,The layman doesnt take into account things like delay between what each client sees and how that changes gameplay. Even in shooters dedicated servers lead to peekers advantage allowing the peeking player to get a shot off before the enemy even sees them peeking around a corner. In this case of a fighting game the pp connection basically makes it so both clients are interpreting the information at the same time meaning you can block parry dodge and attack while being damn near perfectly synced. Dedicated servers would make that harder to achieve. ,forhonor,ddrfkb3,6,t5_38p4n

Assassins are the fookin worst to play against because they never guard. Over all I dont think she is that broken right now. Relative to the peacekeepers her bleedpoison is very small.

Like in brawls when you cannot roll two Raiders or two PKs.Because lets admit it Orochi stacking can be quite fucking awful. Up to a point of either a  of them are just running around in Elimination and then focus  guy from the crowd all  using top light combos dealing insane damage or b just run around and contest points forever in Dominion until someone manages to threw them off a cliff Also Orochi and PKs dodge while out of lock is a little ridiculous in terms of speed and distance coveredAnd another point for Hero Limit  when youre playing with randoms and seeing  assassins in your team and youre Hybrid its a little saddening when comes to defending points. I think a limit of  HeavyVanguard  Hybrid  Assassin is a little bit more adequate of course as an additional optional switch in matchmaking settings like in MOBAS of sorts or fighting games with squads of different heroes think Injustice,forhonor,ddsg772,3,t5_38p4n

Its just that they are using the same two moves over and over and over and generally they come in the form of a bash attack that you can only dodge and cant counter or parry and its very easy to cancel it to punish someone for dodging. So if you dodge you will likely get hit and if you dont you will get hit. ,forhonor,ddte71e,1,t5_38p4n

10806496,0,t1_dduc2vg,While I agree with you to an extent there has to be a recognition that the system as it currently stands contributes to a guard break spam mentality. I would much rather we see every character have some form of safe opener that can then be countered by some other means once that initial opener is completed as opposed to having to guard break constantly because the system is awkward to defend against. This doesnt necessarily mean the opener needs to damage just something that lets them subvert a guard once in a while. The issues arise when you have these options against assassins who arent quite as good on defense.,forhonor,ddum46i,1,t5_38p4n

10806790,0,t3_5ujras,I think the true problem with how defensive the game can become stems from countering the guardbreak. Reversing a guardbreak right now costs pretty much zero stamina to do. You can know someone is just going to sit still and wait for you to attack so they can parryblock and you can guardbreak them with them countering it  times over and it costs them almost nothing in terms of stamina.Countering a guardbreak should cost something like  of your stamina. If you want to counter a guardbreak you know is coming you should be forced to light attack to dodge it like the games intended to be.,forhonor,ddun7gu,4,t5_38p4n

10808608,0,t3_5ukxjk,its somewhat risky but you can block his light attacks and dodge. if i recall correctly he only has two chains and both of them end in heavy attack. as long as you block the first strike then he cant get a headbutt off. then his only option is to throw a heavycharged heavy which can be dodged. if the shugi instead prefers not to chain attacks then a throw after blocking his strike is usually a good tactic. throwing will strip his stoic even if he techs it and a shugi without stoic will play a lot more defensively giving you some time to think and commit to some mixup kensei side steps.if you want to learn to parry his heavy its very telegraphed and as long as you dont panic and immediately dodge then the timing is super easy all you need to do is stay calm and block towards any flash of red you see if you dont immediately block something lower your music volume and keep the sfx volume high then get ready to hit heavy attack to parry. the UI will signal you with a white flash but i like to hit the button when i see that the club is just about to pass from behind him to in front of him.if you learn how to parry his heavy then you can get a guaranteed throw off on him which will strip the stoic and let you get a hit in. the parry and throw will also drain his stamina which is very effective against a shugi because they have terrible stamina management. just remember that you need to be close enough after parrying at max range the throw wont connect after the parry so try and get in close and be prepared to tech if he tries to throw you otherwise youll end up being smashed backward giving him time to recover both stoic and stamina.,forhonor,ddutyah,1,t5_38p4n

ALWAYS take the unblockable feat the only reason bots are hard is because they have near infinite response time so on stuff like hard where youre not suppose to get any free hits theyll block every attack unless the system basically decides to randomly give you a free hit.

10822421,0,t1_ddw8z7j,Exactly. You cant play aggressive against an opponent who is built to counter and take you to the ground. Her play style is to sit back and whittle health away by taking her opponent to the ground and getting in pokes while theyre on the ground and if you give her the opening she will put you on the ground again and again. But because players arent flexible and try the same tactics on every opponent they lose and get pissed because they played into an opponents strength. I dont shield rush Shigoki because I know it will get me killed. I sit back and steal pokes and jabs when I can and stay out of his range using speed to beat him and yeah he gets inside sometimes and wails on me but Im not gonna complain.

Others have most of this toolkit but not all.

If the infantry dont break formation they win.A horse is a vulnerability as much as it is a strength. It makes you a much less effective melee combatant which is why knights started fighting more and more on foot over time.

Which they cry is underpowered because he is not as abusive as the Warden.Long story short. Never take a knight to seriously when shitposting.,forhonor,ddzeiny,7,t5_38p4n

10863164,0,t3_5v6tvl,Maybe not remove though I would enjoy this but they just need to be balanced. Not as strong. Armor is obviously too strong. Health seems okay does it stop healing when you get hit ? It should if it doesnt. Sword is too strong. Boots are too strong. You shouldnt be able to stack them so handily as well. Only one nonhealth would be OK with everyone I think. Shouldnt spawn until a minute or a minute and a half into the game. Activation time should be increased drastically. Two times the current would be okay if not three. You need to be able to cancel people that go into these. Could program underdog activation bonus so v guy can activate them very fast but v would be x the current speed. That would actually be a decently enjoyable system though. More risk would be great though it would be hard to pass this information to players. .x or double damage taken while gathering a boost for example.I think this stuff will not get addressed though because it makes poor players feel powerful.

10869404,0,t1_de12a0i,This is absolutely not the reason they went with pp for the network model. For one thing it requires significantly more complicated netcode than a centralized server model which translates to more manhours developing and debugging it. Severs are cheap. People are not.Theres a very good reason that All other fighting games use pp and that a centralized server works for the oftsited twitchy shooters and DotA. Fighting games are all about reacting IMMEDIATELY to your opponent. Shooters and strategy games are all about positioning. When someone has you in their crosshairs they press a button you get hit. Theres no way to prevent it other than not being somewhere that they can see you. The difference that ms makes as far as where they think you are vs where you say you are is minimal.Fighting games are an entirely different beast. Someone throws a punch and you might have a third of a second to react to it. Between the time they start the attack you would have to be able to see that react to it and your response get back to them before they say nope too late youre hit. Latency is absolutely critical in these situations which are not at all comparable to FPS scenarios.Im sick of all of the armchair gamedevs here trying to equate the gaming genres. No one chooses a pp model for their game unless they have a very good reason for it. Its simply not worth the trouble and tradeoffs if you dont actually need it and is definitely not just a moneysaving ploy.,forhonor,de13o43,49,t5_38p4n

Samurai could get a Native American group.   The sub groups could either align with the factions common interest such as mongols wanting to plunder like vikings.

10870831,0,t1_de15si7,No offense because everyone has their fighting style but if people can predict you then youre being predictable. I meant something like throwing a heavy or two go for a side dodge attack throw another heavy keep repeating until they expect that heavy and are actively trying to parry it every time then feint the next one. They will accidentally throw a heavy instead of the parry they thought they were gonna get parry and set up a punishing combo. Obviously some classes will have an easier time at this based on speed but thats just one example. Instead of looking for opportunities you need to start creating them its just like fighting in real life.,forhonor,de18yr3,4,t5_38p4n

Idk I feel like some heroes are just more fully fleshed out than others. Kensei being the most fleshed out vanguard imo. Lawbringer and valkyrie I feel were really kinda... half assed. Theyre not bad and they by no means have a short moveset list but they just lack flow and really seem about just pushing you around and relatively slowly cut you down with heavies you cant defend against.

10885292,0,t3_5vkca0,Most of what you said is right but let me correct just a few things. Guard break countering is consistent and simple and at high level you will very rarely see anyone miss a techDeflect doesnt parry your opponent. Meaning they arent stopped from acting in any way. You either have to perform an action fast enough to interrupt them or only deflect the last attack in  a chain.Parrying is incredibly easy at high level. If anything it should be much harderriskier.Gb is supposed to counter dodges. Or else those pesky dodge happy assassins would have no way to get punished. If you want to back off you have to roll away by unlocking or double tapping dodge. The attack indicator thing is a bug and will most likely be fixed.,forhonor,de2qny8,1,t5_38p4n

This probably wont happen in all levels of play but in the higher levels of play there will surely be someone who abuses this. Untill this problem is resolved ranked  tournament play might cause more damage than good. Although you are making a fair point getting queued up against people who are way better is never fun. I did however hear something about a hidden MMR? So if that works as intended they should be able to matchmake better. Also keep in mind that in the Open Beta there were k players at some point from what I saw. The most Ive seen in the released game is k. So the player base is almost halved so matchmaking is gonna be more challenging. I would bet they have a policy of reducing waiting time is more important than matching skill.

The only reason why you have a chance when youre fighting  people is being able to chain the Revenge mode activations which is clearly exactly what the designers intended for the situation. Youre supposed to be able to win those fights albeit with great difficulty. Its the whole point of the Revenge system.

Everyone reacts a different way to different things since we are all wired differently.Also stop attacking people for disagreeing with you it shows a lack of maturity.

You can use heavyshield bash to either GB or sweep and the opponent has to guess which one you do dodging the sweep will get hit by GB and waiting still to counter GB gets you sweeped. If you hit either with the GB or the sweep you have a free heavy and can do the combo again. And thats only one variation of the combos.

It has nothing to do with masculinity either.  Honor belongs to the individual and no one else can give or bestow honor the noun to someone else.  I think you are confusing honor the verb maybe?  Honor is a very personal thing that you can give to yourself by living life a certain way and handling yourself in a certain manner.  You give it to yourself by earning it.

I changed to  GB and Ive not had a disconnect a frame issue or any problem when playing For Honor. Ive only been booted from a game once and that was because the game was going down for maintenance. So my fix was excessive but it worked out in making For Honor a problem minimized game. Now take all the people who either cant upgrade their pc or wont upgrade their pc and add them into the Peer to Peer hosting issue of this game.You get a recipie for a lot more errors in your games espeically if these people are being placed in matches together and the problems with their systems are being amplified greatly.,forhonor,de69zex,1,t5_38p4n

Another thing to think about is that Katanas were constantly being restored as well as passed down.

He said it might be a glitch but that wasnt the worst of it. There was nothing to bait out of him to parry as all of his damage was off of confirms from shield bash or gb. He didnt even do the quick light after i dodged the shield bash that you would normally expect from a Conq. He just waited ready for anything.

10942740,0,t3_5w9l4q,gtThe game launched not even two weeks agoAnd yet its in such a pitiful state for a triple A game If i recall correctly Ubi declared this an indie game when its fucking not. Anyone that says its typical for such games to be in this sort of state on release are the reasons why thats a standard. Poor release stats should never be a standard. Casual players not to be interpreted as casul but rather legitimately players that play in a casual manner which theres nothing wrong about tend to be the most popular when it comes to this sort of thing because the state of the game isnt that important to them which then causes for publishers to force devs to skimp out on game aspects because they can put a lesser quality game out for the same value because the majority of players the casual players will still pay for it and play it.gtThat takes time though and in the meantime it doenst help when they look on the sub and see  variants of ubisoft sucks my NAT is red what the fuck Ill just go to bedNormally sure it would take time to fix connection issues. Pretty sure thats not what people are upset about. The real problem is that its even an issue on something that was advertised to be better than a dedicated server when it so far has yet to prove itself as such in addition to Ubi holding multiple betas and having more than enough time to address the connection problems to begin with. The fact that there was an outage is more of just the cherry stem of the cherry on the cake that is all of the problems people are having with Ubi. Sure theyre upset that there is an outage anyone would be but there being an outage when the game normally runs perfectly fine and is in an enjoyable state is completely different from there being an outage when the game is in a poor state and doesnt normally run fine because the devspublisher probably the publisher are greedy assholes especially when it was advertised to be better than a more stable alternative when once again it has yet to prove itself so.The other thing is that it doesnt help flat out isnt true. Negative criticism is just as helpful as positive reception. When devs are told by a populace that so and so doesnt work or this is bad change this or any form of such it means a lot more than when just a few  people say as such and then no one mentions it again. The more complaints there are the higher up the priority list it goes for either being fixed changed or at least a public statement about it. In fact knowing there is a problem and then not talking about it because they already know is counterproductive. Think of it like picketing in front of state legislature Which is more effective ten people picketing or a thousand people picketing? Even if the thousand people picketing is typically less constructive because theyre more prone to yelling and being needlessly harsh its still better than  guys that can accurately and appropriately discuss the problems because big companies wont give  guys the light of day. Once they see the thousand consistently theyll know theres an issue and continue to address that issue under the pressure of that angry mob.gtTheyre working on it.

The problem is they come up with these ideas for games that ARE fantastic then they completely fuck it up rush it out the door and expect us to fund further development to finish the game.

Changing guard isnt some crazy complex thing that damages people or anything.The shugoki wants to swing? Thats leaving him open. Also if worried about cost you can just as easily give the heavy weapons a delay before they can attack after switching stances rather than a delay in switching stances.Universe block timing is also good for the game because it would better let the devs balance offense.

This is not a school project with couple of hundreds lines of codes where you commit some changes and immediately see whether they work or break something.  days to identify a list of issues and fix them on  platforms?

10959102,0,t3_5whzqj,This is just like Dark Souls and the whole honor debacle.In every game mode except for v you are consciously choosing to fight in a situation where you will likely have to fight unfair fights. You cannot control how your opponents think or act you can only react to it. Screaming at him that he has no honor doesnt mean shit. Some characters are practically designed to retreat and double team. ive also seen people complain that well v doesnt give as much experience or steel! Yeah thats because the matches last half as long and once again it was of your own volition to fight a v. ,forhonor,deacqkx,38,t5_38p4n

10959441,0,t3_5whzqj,Ah yes.  I beat a Kensei last night in a duel and we had some pretty close rounds in the first matchup I think it was  with me victorious.  In a single one of those matches he backed himself up to a moat while I was in the midstof doing my Lawbringer Push so I could smack him with THE MOST VERSATILE WEAPON EVER INVENTED...but since he backed himself up to a ledge he ended up getting pushed into the moat.  Cue Wah...Wah...Waaah music.He then proceeds to whine about how I have to play Lawbringer because I have no skill...Dude I just beat you in  out of  matches without using any environmental damage and the one time you fell in I already had you at one bar of health and you practically threw yourself into the moat.Growing tired of his littleboy attitude I left the round and queued again...sure enough same guy.  This time I beat him  to  and specifically chose to defeat him twice without using any environmental damage and once I threw him in a geyser just because he was being a prick and because his tears empower me.  The same babyman moaning comes back...its even more funny to me now because hes saying that Im toxic even though hes now raging using words like cunt pedo lamer etc...anything he can think of to try and get under my skin.  So I leave after my victory and queue again...I mean he got his rematch right?...and he was found wanting.Third queue and sure enough...same guy.  So this time I beat his ass v with all honorable kills.  This entire time hes been spamming Kenseis sidedodge attack which up until last night had been giving me trouble Im so used to blocking in the direction my opponent dodges not the opposite.  Well Mr. Whiney Baby Man you got served...and thank you for giving me the opportunity to practice how to consistently parry Kenseis sideattack!  How embarrassing for that guy right?  Id like to think he took a second to check himself and learn but lets be honest that probably didnt happen.Whats most amusing to me is how my response seemed to have upgraded his tirade from angry scrub to ultra nerdrage after I accidentally pushed him into that moat though really it was his own fault...I specifically stated Yeah I would like to see some maps without any environmental hazards...maybe even a gamemode specifically for that.  It would be neat to have some simpler maps like fighting in a meadowfield or an ArenaColiseum but youd still be whining if I beat you with a Lawbringer there too.  Apparently because I enjoy Lawbringer Im only supposed to be able to beat people by using environmental hazards?TLDNR  Hotheaded douche doesnt understand the pain of trying to git gud with a Lawbringer gets upset when he loses either with or without environmental hazards.  There is no satisfying some people...so dont!  They were probably going to bitch and rage anyway so youd might as well consume their tears and destroy them even harder!  Maybe even do the exact thing they rage about every now and then to keep the tears coming...The Salt Must Flow!.,forhonor,deae03n,36,t5_38p4n
10959594,0,t3_5whzqj,Frankly there are two sets of honor rules.The Honorable Kills set is dictated by the games requirements for honorable kills yes it is a thing which simply means you killed the player by yourself without the aid of an ally and possibly feats.Then there is the Community Honor set which means no ledgingenvironment for the most part no feats and no help from allies.Personally I swap back and forth between the two sets but I only ever get upset when I die more than  times in a match and every time I was facing two or more enemies this is why I try to avoid Skirmish like the plague.,forhonor,deaeknc,2,t5_38p4n

10961716,0,t1_deam6ve,Agreed on the change speed it should simply be universal for all classes as far as I am concerned. As I just recently posted my biggest gripe is how eventually Lawbringer play resorts to haftbashing via parrytop light forgoing the pointy end as the main way of defeating opponents. Guard breaks aside our most versatile weapon may as well be a Bo staff.Eventually it comes to the point where the enemy will be smart enough to back off and regen that last bar over and over considering that chip damage only goes so far. So we need to land a heavy but it is sometimes practically impossible.,forhonor,deamgds,4,t5_38p4n

10962500,0,t3_5whz3k,Well. there goes the rest of my friends So not only is there absolutely nothing in here at all about the absurdity that is revenge builds there is also nothing on match breaking nothing on servers nothing on lawbringer nothing for raiders and PK gets buffed? Seriously? Thank god GB is getting fixed which why the hell was it fine in Beta and completely broken at release anyways? First off I cannot even play with any of my friends now at all. Especially newer players since they will get ranked up with me and the get paired with  revenge players. Every game even if i am on a level  character. I even watch my friends completely destroy these revenge builds just to get cheated on from revenge cheese literally every single time. And these patch notes with nothing on them at all and even a buff to possibly the greatest v in the game? Seriously? Why isnt matchmaking limited to gear? Brackets based on Whites with Whites blues with blues and so on? Or just a mode completely without gear besides brawl and duel? Because we all know all those come down to now is Orochi spamming guard break or running away. I just had a game against an orochi who straight up ran for  minutes. Then strafed around a tombstone without even trying to attack. How is this encouraged? Thank god guard break is getting fixed at least too bad its way too late for literally all of my friends. Because all this games meta is now is guardbreak and revenge. I have no idea where this turtle meta is coming from because all the meta is is Get your ass kicked and get rewarded with a free two hit kill. And these patch notes just made them all sell their copies and im left alone on this game. And the worst of it is i cant even recruit a new friends on here or they too will be fighting s and getting two shot. No matter how skilled they are. And it is utterly painful watching them who had such high hopes for this game and such a great time in the beta when there was actual balance without revenge and a working Guardbreak into this shitshow. Wonderful job Ubi. Just fantastic. Yes i am salty. Yes i am annoyed as all hell. I know the game is new I know this is our fixed big patch but to seriously address none of these issues which are literally driving people off in droves and to be answered with this patch? Not even one retort or reply on any of this? Grats Valkryies at least you got something. Happy for you guys at least.  a  Warden Lawbringer who is forced to play revenge just to even stand a chance who is now playing alone because all of my friends just sold their copy in response to this. I am bottle necked into forever playing these two unless i grind to rep  in only BrawlDuels. So much fun.  Ubisoft get on this shit. Communicate with people. Fix your matchmaking. Put in proper brackets. Fix guardbreak which you claim you are why was it broken in the first place? Normalize guard stances Why isnt this a thing? Focus on the worst classes first Props on valk wheres Lawbringerraider? Wtf Peacekeeper buffs? Seriously? and the biggest remove revenge stats from gear entirely. It is there to help you from getting ganked. It is not there for you to completely build around which does nothing but literally encourage shitty play and rewards you with free and easy kill with zero effort whatsoever. I just watched my friend GS  owned a warlord so god damn hard. He had to use revenge  times in a v In a v...anti gank tool.. times..in a single fight.. had him down to  bar of health and got two hit when he messed up even once. He just went and returned his copy  alongside  other friends of mine. That was not a git gud moment. That was a straight up destroyed him over and over again and still lost because of the taint that is Revenge. I defended this game tooth and nail that it wasnt pay to win. But considering you can literally buy steel and just maximize revenge builds and two hit people have proven me completely wrong. Yes you can duel and brawl for  your skill based matches. But all that is is Orochis and Wardens both of whom run away the entire game the instant they start to lose.  So much promise for this game. And ubisoft does what Ubisoft does best..,forhonor,deapdhw,4,t5_38p4n
10962744,0,t1_deameue,i agree great at punishing mistakes but as a peacekeeper all he needs to do it miss an attack or block twice and hes done... and no i dont spam light attack,forhonor,deaqa6p,2,t5_38p4n
10962898,0,t1_de9vj64,Honestly he gets more off of a throw than people think first of all he gets a guaranteed light then he can follow up with a zone or heavy different timings to screw with parries and of course he can feint the heavy to counter parry or even simply after mixing up on the enemy so many times they dont know what hes gonna do he could do it again. Of course it would be used to throw off cliffs more thats a given but not every Raider relies on exclusively ring outs and especially less once the guard break change goes through which is only going to make a character that has trouble have more trouble. If you wanna talk more tech on why Raider isnt as garbage as people think though I would love to I rock Conqueror  flair but im actually a Raider main who wins actual fights instead of just throwing people out.,forhonor,deaqus6,1,t5_38p4n

What would be really interesting and really add to the depth of play is if there were more player states that would effect things like parry timing GBC and potentially even guard switch. These states could be triggered by many things for example A Lawbringer shove could tighten the window on a GBC after dodging or whiffing an attack a follow up parry or block might have tighter timing falling below half stamina would make a tighter window on parries and GBC getting knocked down would effect GBC  parry timing for X amount of seconds.

It just feels like you get pushed into this state of recovery that you cant recover from because of how quickly the flurry is after that first initial attack.What also feels worse than missing the first attack is when they are mid flurry and you try to break away with a dodge rightleft and get hit mid dodge and just continue getting dicked on.

And once again i dont have that experience with other classes. Its just the lawbringer.And ill be honest. I love the class. I love the most versatile weapon. I love throwing people all over the place. I like his dumb emote spam. I REALLY like playing the class. It just ... it just feels like i could do so much better with other classes.But then it just doesnt feel right. So i want them to improve the lawbringer. Just a tiny bit so he can hold his candle to all the other classes without throwing everyone down cliffs.,forhonor,dedqv2n,2,t5_38p4n

This only works because you can switch at any time you can adjust. You can adapt and overcome.In For Honor you do not have this option. If you are countered you either lose get lucky or be way better than your opponent. Both game systems are perfectly acceptable too. You can have the class counter system and make it work you can have the no classes counter each other system and make it work.

10994298,0,t1_dee5kb3,Orochi doesnt hold his guard the way heavier classes do it will default back to centre after a few seconds so you have to time it perfectly strike by strike. I always try to parry or dodge instead of block because his stamina is very poor. You have to keep moving and keep your distance depending on who you fight against until they make a mistake with you dodging and then you can get close to them fast and counter their attacks. They dont have great combos either compared to other classes and their unblockables are kind of situational but the most useful combo is the upward light attack  if you land the st then the nd is guaranteed. If I can guard break them I try to a heavy attack or roll them behind me GB LS back  GB again i think which confuses a lot of players then go in with the top light combo. Cant advise you on v I suck at those and try to throw them out of the way that behindthrow and runfire the bow and arrow if I have the feat ready.

Duels are so grossly overfilled with environmental kills small little dueling squares and narrow paths of death that it really encourages the Im gonna try to constantly throw you and do absolutely nothing else all three rounds mentality. Many would say that dueling is the last place that you should have environmental kills. Its hard to beware of your environment when your on a narrow path surrounded by death spots nowhere to run and a Conqueror keeps on charging you with the sole intent to send you off that cliff. Environmental kills in the other bullshit v game modes? Sure they are casual modes where skill really isnt a big deal as its usually too chaotic and fast paced for any proper skillful duels to occur. But dueling the ONE place where players really get to duke it out and show their skills should be the last place we see such atrocious amounts of environmental kill spots. Its such an intense battle when I find a dueler who actually wants to fight and not win via throws. But duel arena is so flooded with classes that specialize in throwing enemies and its the games fault for encouraging it so much with those narrow and dangerous little dueling arenas. ,forhonor,defvm0a,2,t5_38p4n

Matchmaking is pretty quick so you can get right into another game in about a minute. Ubisoft is working on the servers and when rage quitting is punished it should run a lot smoother.  Ubisoft even gave everyone  days of champion status for a one hour outage. I wouldnt let this pass getting better at this game and outplaying someone feels soo damn good. non paywall content that is coming on a regular basis is also a really big plus. ,forhonor,deikf9g,2,t5_38p4n

You just need to keep champion status up wait until the right time to buy boxes and pay attention to your orders to make sure that youre completing them with whatever character youre trying to get gear for.Some of it could also be the three boxes I got for being a Viking in round one but thats only a  steel value.I also went back and checked my hours its actually  on the dot. ,forhonor,dejf9n1,1,t5_38p4n

Thats the same as an LoL player intentionally feeding because he doesnt like that support got a kill or top is playing Veigar.

11065964,0,t3_5xzsma,Wait till rep . I slowed played it and it really paid off for me. I never opened any crates I broke down every piece of armor I received as drops and I never used steel upgrading my gear. When I hit rep  I opened all crates. With all the salvage and steel I had accumulated I was able to go from gear score  to gear score  almost instantly. With a couple more daily bounties for the  steal and a few scavenger crates I am currently at max gear score. And after finally achieving the revenge build of my dreams I can say from experience gear is broken as shit. I run to the enemys capture point and dig in like a tick. Its damn near impossible for anything less than three people to get me out of there and if they devote those kind of resources to just me my teammates have capped the other two points in no time then come to assist.

If they go for a parry you know they are going to do it again so be careful or bait a parry attempt and parry their parry. If they dodge you can attempt a parry into guard break next time. etc etc. Midcombo feint Works best on fast characters Orochi  PK  Zerker. Hit them with left  right light attacks heavy top into feint when they change their guard to top you then immediately switch to left  right and come under their guard with a light. Revenge feint opponent has revenge? feint a heavy attack and laugh as they waste their activation parry and then block  parry  dodge until their meter runs out. ,forhonor,demz52p,11,t5_38p4n

11101886,0,t3_5ygdc9,Thankfully I dont think people are treating this as a PW game as you need to be rep  to even do that. If you switched that to some people feeling they need to be forced to AFK in Dominion AI top second game mode that rewards you a big portion of exp with a little steel tacked on with every game to level up their characters.Ive actually got all the characters to rep  and my mains to rep  and  a majority of that achieved through playing Dominion AI legitimately. If you find that perfect group where two people are camping on the control zones a match ends in  minutes tops. From my experience it seems that it takes about  of those to level up a character especially when you get up in the teens.On my mains I feel that I can hold my own against  gear scorers since I can get my gear score in the blue range once I hit rep . My Orochi and Kensei are in purple and my Conq that Ive started to love and turn into some gladiatorlike character that is just about to get to rep  is in the blue. My journey to get all the characters to at least rep  taught me all of the movesets and zone attacks that I can be ready to block deflect or parry. For example the Kenseis side attack. Once you can predict them youll be ready for the Kensei to do the triple heavy from above and when you can parry that third unblockable theyll be speechless as pretty much their entire moveset will be blocked by you.I feel that Im starting to get to the point where I might get bored playing against people who arent at  gear score especially once I reach that with my mains. Perhaps the fun will begin when the new characters come out and the only ones people will be playing are them. Like I did with the other  characters Ill get them to rep  mainly to learn their moveset. Mid May is such a long ways away though...,forhonor,deqe0q5,1,t5_38p4n

11106454,0,t1_dequg7s,I think its just poor design a lot of the attacks come from high on the side and slash downwards so dodging into them makes sense as youd pass under the swing thus they implemented dodge toward the attack as a mechanic it just looks stupid as fuck when the weapon passes through the character model because they get iframes when dodging. IMO dodging should never grand iframes it should just move your hitbox if you move the hitbox out of the way of the strike kudos take your punish if not then eat damage. Iframe dodges are bullshit. ,forhonor,deqwnwn,1,t5_38p4n

11107832,0,t1_der20g1,I fully acknowledge that her ZA is broken. But it is not a bug. Her ZA is that fast and can be canceled. If you add target switches to that its very easy to catch people in the wrong guard direction countermeasures are virtually nonexistent because it outspeeds pretty much every other attack anyways. You can just pray and parry. And that is stupid.However the claimed bug is just not there. If you hit a ZA that does not mean the enemy gets staggered long enough to be unable to block the next as we have evidence for subsequent attacks after a hit being blocked or even parried.Its broken by design not because of a bug. And I dont think that saying oh its bugged when its not calls much more attention to it. Not enough to spread misinformation.You do you but I dont support that method.,forhonor,der2a4c,1,t5_38p4n

11120273,0,t3_5ys0aq,gtbut im having a hard time figuring why the title goes to Warden when there are other heros who manage to do everything well just as easilyWardens speed is above average and has a kit that is a good balance of light and heavy attacks.  Having a light attack combo into a free light attack is huge because it just means more damage from somewhat limited guaranteed attack windows.  Wardens advantages is that he is good at everything which truly does make him adaptable.  He isnt purely light attack reliant like some classes but has a very good light attack combo to capitalize on free attack opportunities.  He even has block on top light attacks I believe giving him an ability to trade.  This means that when fighting a warden you really cant afford to attack top or once again you just lose the trade since he blocks AND hits.Warden is very well balanced because he has the ability to create his own chances to attack as well as having high quality methods of taking advantage of those chances.  Compared to some of the more offensive or defensive oriented characters that either have to make their own or purely react to the opponent the Warden can pick how he wants to play.,forhonor,desh2t9,1,t5_38p4n

They could have made it a  dollar expansion no problem esp. since it ran on the same engine with the same assets etc. but they had to make a its own game that they could release more DLC for and another seasons pass. Sydicate was  different than the franchise it was a sequel to. Im sorry but its pants on head dumb to acquire a franchise to make a game using the IP that has next to no connection to the original series. would you like it if you knew that the next souls game was gonna be a top down beat em up and that it would be the last game of the series? The whole point of a franchise is that you know that the sequel is gonna be similar in style to the first and its shitty when they just use a franchise as a sticker to slap onto an FPS so it can seem different. Ultima IX was the first EA made Ultima game after they acquired the  studio and it was a shitty cash in that is universally despised. How does that not fit?

11180558,0,t1_deza8yp,Full block stance vs everyone is too safe because only unblockables and guard break can get through it and unblockables are slow enough to dodge and guard breaks can be countered. So if someone wanted to  just play defensive all day no one would be able to damage him. Pk and valkery stance change is too fast especially since other characters get stance penalty so trying to guard most of their quick attacks are near impossible to block especially since the frames are so fast. The targeting system is ok but trying to switch back and forth between multiple characters becomes a problem and i recommend L should be used to target since it literally does nothing. ,forhonor,dezaxzw,1,t5_38p4n

11195372,0,t3_5ztbyy,Its so disappointing how Ubisoft continues to fumble with this game. Its a  idea with a  execution. The steel is earned through weekly challenges and given at the end of matches but it takes ages to get any significant amount and by the time you find something worth spending it on all your steel is gone in a blink. Its the same thing with GTA Onlines free DLC. All of the content is crazy expensive and  of the players who have it just buy currency with real money. Its a shit system that theyre going to exploit to hell because profit. If the game could handle more then  decent matches at a time without disconnecting Id be more for buying cosmetic shit but I already shelled out  dollars for an unfinished game so its kind of a slap in the face for them to add new ways to waste your money rather then fixing what has been broken since the Alpha and Beta.  ,forhonor,df0zd0s,168,t5_38p4n

With all the frustration the game creates youd think theyd at least try and spare you from it in the campaign but no. Even the story was frustratingly convoluted and boring as fuck. You have to find observables to get pretty key information to the story and when you do its given to you with this wooden narration by Apollyon sometimes it was the Warden sometimes not it was just random and just godawful writing. All their neat little campaign only mechanics felt like half assed phone app style minigames. It was just a mess that quite frankly I feel should have been mentioned in the reviews. Everyone said you can just skip the story. They never actually went into detail about how absolutely shit it is. The game is a  for me cause even the multiplayer experience as fun as it can be is littered with game ruining exploits and balance issues that dont seem to be going away any time soon.

11263155,0,t1_df8fw5u,gt heres room for a dialogue about this topicI dont mind the progressing to unlock stuff I dont. Though it is entirely unreasonable though to expect half a grand in real currency to unlock the base game. The level of character development customisation and development is so shallow it is obvious people are going to want to play other characters   furthermore it is not a genre of game that is conducive to playing solely a single character.   I really enjoy the game I have now just over  hours of game play and have bought the gold edition. Though so far I have been able to get one character to  an buy on cosmetic item elite set this is just not enough for the base price. If I were to invest  hours in a typical RPG I would have got most of the core game items an be on my way to grinding out the harder last  which I am totally okay with it is good to have certain items exclusivehard to get. Its like you guys were going to take RPG elements but then the shareholders told you take the MOBO aspect and rinse the game for money you are double dipping by charging full price and then charging FP prices ontop. I get that it is a PvP game and you want longevity but you have X number of seasons planned out you have a premium system you could of capitalised on i.e made it so worth while as to become a pseudosub but at current is really not that useful you could of least made it not painfully obvious you cut content out and then implemented at inflated prices. ,forhonor,df8nuhz,7,t5_38p4n

11265814,0,t3_60s1j5,Im really having trouble understanding why people are getting upset over this exact part of the game. Why would put yourself in such a situation where you want to unlock everything? All the shitty colors that most definitely dont deserve a character to level up almost to rep  or so all the ornaments emotes gear etc. Why would one want to do this for every single character? For me personally I went through the hell of getting all the characters to rep  and am now in the process of getting my nonmains to rep  as my mains are rep  and above but the exp grind feels more easier than the steel grind. The contracts help greatly.Now if the hate is towards the grind of getting steel in total I completely understand. Dominion and Skirmish give the most steel of  per match but that just feels so minimal. Sure you get  per day and another  if you do all the contracts every other day but after that there doesnt really seem to be a reason to play as playing the game modes that net you the most exp and steel is a gamble thanks to the disconnections.In a recent thread I shared how I could see why people succumb to doing AFK farming when seeing how much steel they could gain. To summarize it here is what I foundIf an AFKing group of  people and a lone player who sadly wandered in to the lobby get through a match in about  minutes thanks to competent bots boosting both zones and the lobby PP connection magically holds the group will get....  steel per match  steel per hour  matches per hour this is where the fun begins  per day  per week  steel per monthI could see why Ubisoft is hesitant in changing the steel grind in our favor as that would only make it easier for AFK farmers which would also probably require a better system in finding them. It actually makes sense as to why theyve tried clamping down on them first before anything as it makes their steel packs null if we could theoretically attain huge amounts steel in mere days.Hopefully this is all being thought about behind the scenes along with the fixing of the disconnections and the maps that were taken away but the communication through the stream isnt helping much.,forhonor,df8yp8h,0,t5_38p4n

But again all your points are conq not being able to feint centric.  Its the only class that cant feint  I get it.  But WL is the same as every other class in that regard.  You continue to bring up shortcomings of the conqueror regarding feintsmixups but every other class has those not just WL.  My belief is conq could be buffed with an offensive option or two if his vortex is nerfed.My experience with conq vortex spam is not what you describe.  Yes i can generally spam a headbutt  times for a vortex but it does LESS than  heavy dmg total.  Im sure many others would prefer that to being steam rolled by conq vortex into walls or not for multiple heavies.  one is annoying one can kill you from  to .  Yes headbutt is more spammable but you have to spam it  times to get the damage from ONE shield slam combovortex!You also cant cancel headbutt into GB anymore.  its not a  like wardens.  thats an old complaint.  we choose either HB or dodgeGB.  similar to conq with your dodgeslam to bait opponent dodgegtGB option.  Our dodge forward into GB is counterable like any other GB.... however the conqs dodge GB bait move gets your an uncounterable GB!  The headbutt poke also doesnt chain and is not guaranteed.  You cant use that poke as the light into heavy combo.  Again i think your perception of these optionsmixups is overstated.  TLDR We have a GBheavy punish after parry like most classes dmgwise after which is back to regular meta.  We have a spammable headbutt that does little damage and is the inferior in every way to wardensconqsvalks vortexes.  RE your summarywe arent far off each others points i think and i appreciate the objectivemature debate.  i think as you say our offensive abilities are somewhat standard fighter but I believe since the fullblock nerf our defensive abilities are pretty standard as well.  Feats  certainly put us up in highlevel defensive char but other classes Feats  make them that much more powerful offensively.  Thats a wash in my book and not applicable in duelsbrawls.Much of Warlords reputation precedes the nerfs.   months from now im curious to see how the leaderboards play out although that shouldnt be the beall endall.  The meta should be a balance between regular players needsgameplay and competitive players  and high level leaderboards arent a representation of fair gameplay at lower levels.wall of text!    ,forhonor,df9lwez,1,t5_38p4n

Its really stupid how LBs very precise and skillful knockdown only results in a guaranteed top light while her spammy knockdown results in a guaranteed heavy for little stamina. Oh and to top it off it has some bully potential so it can knock people off ledgesHeros like Valkyrie lower the skill ceiling because of her cheap af knockdownfast autos. Meaning that you have to be far better than the valkyrie to winunless of course you get backed into a wall which means gameoverNow ive noticed it isnt an issue with the more faster characters as they can easily weave around her spam and punish but when playing LB you have to be on point otherwise you will fail.

Factor in wireless delay and controller dead zones upwards of ms in some cases my window of reaction is a LOT less than other players.

Theres two main game modes people play incursion and meltdown. In meltdown your escort waves of minions to your opponenets base. You buy and upgrade towers along the way first one to  points wins. In incursion its basiclly the same idea you still have waves of minions you need to escort as well as different towers to upgrade. The difference is both teams also gave giant walking  sentrys that they need to escort to the enemies base. So the goal is to destroy your opponents sentrys the minions just help and are a good distraction instead if being the entire focus like with meltdown.It was actually a really fun game that was completly unique on its own it just had horrible marketing.

A game shouldnt have these issues day one and if they do we shouldnt be ok with them.Call it being entitled or what have you but this public outcry is needed. Game companies will see how players react to this type of stuff and will go out of their way to make sure it isnt frequent. Or at least go out of their way to fix it faster than they normally would.I personally have a mild amount of patience and I dont mind release day patches or small bugs. But as a whole and to keep the game alive people should step up and speak out against this type of behavior.We paid for it we deserve a working product.

11379299,0,t3_62ddyg,Well the reasons you play a particular class tend to depend on what you depend on when making your thought processes in life. A lot of the time in other fighters this becomes readily available very quickly when trying to decide in say Guilty Gear Do I want to play Johnny who has fixed fast dashes slower movement and long range with speedyish attacks or Venom who will keep you busy by placing projectiles with a bullet hell shooter style of lockdown combined with a constant movement option etc For Honor is no different there. I prefer either a parry or attack during the dashes which leads me to Kensei  Valk initially but Wardens been taking up my recent play time... mostly becuase my feint game is hot garbage and because in my mind you dont feint unless its a tech mist canceling  kara throw etc  and tend to play the game very safe if possible utilizing safe pokes until i get an opening... For Honor destroys me up close.Playing the warden has been one of the most irritating things Ive forced on myself because he IS good but he forces you into the close game which because bad at feints i am hot garbage at.Hell i didnt know until monday that if you dashed and got GBd youd be unable to tech. Warden taught me a lot but mostly GTFO of close range you idiotThat said Im really offhanded IRL as well cautious safe I tend not to take extravagant risks and over all am very careful until i have a good command over something.

Im a diehard Souls fan but like  of the armor in Souls games is even more fantasyfocused and impractical than the stuff we already have in For Honor.I prefer FHs blend of fantasy and realism over the Souls ballsdeepintofantasy approach. Yes a lot of the armor in FH is ridiculous for various reasons too but it doesnt go entirely off the rails all the time often having strong historical nods.Take the Faraam set for an example in your picture.Why do the cheekpieces not meet in the middle leaving an unnecessary vertical slit resembling a barbute? The Fendrel helmet in FH is also guilty of this weird and unnecessary visor slit for what is clearly meant to be a visor that can be raised if you need more airvisionAnd why are the legs entirely unarmored?Plus FH already has some armor pieces that look like possible Souls references such as the Wardens Dain helmet or the Lawbringers Zelos helmet.,forhonor,dfm9zsb,12,t5_38p4n
11383993,0,t1_dfm9py8,A PTR would work wonders. We can see the ideas in action.  But its as if they have no idea what to do so its taking an absorbent amount of time. Even people giving some pretty good feedback on balance and they are still talking a long time.  Like they could easily do a universal guard change and nerf revenge build by  or something in the meantime but they wont.  Or tweek the PKs nd LK by a few frames.  It doesnt mean it will be final for the rest of time an can revert back things if other things give too much of a buff. They need to tweak things now and worry about the longevity later. Or else there will no body left for the longevity.I just hope maybe they are taking longer because they are trying to find a way to officially add guard and soft feints.  Then i could understand the time its taking to balance the characters because they would now have to take into account those tools which may be enough to help alot of heroes or be too good for others.  So it will take some more testing.  But again i dont see why they cant just give us some small tweaks like the universal guard stance or something.,forhonor,dfmcu5i,4,t5_38p4n

11404943,0,t1_dfoqbwl,I can think of another tool in this thread.His mixup game is incredible have you watched players play him at high level? Ive had players feint a heavy into a feinted light into gb. When hes playing like that hes really difficult to parry because youre guessing which one will be real. So if hes really difficult to parry you know what will happen when the defensive meta is broken and something like chip damage is included? Well thats going to make blocking not cost effective place emphasis on parries which will make playing against Beserker very difficult. Does that concept make sense to you? I have yet to hear any ideas that you would like to see implemented? Youre right the hyper armor overhead is easily parryable. They could allow him to feint it but once they break the defensive meta that will be a joke. So are we going to give him more tools now and have to go back and nerf him again later? They just said theyre looking at options to alleviate the defensive meta. Everyone is saying chip damage if its not chip damage I will be amazed. Plus the top heavy is guaranteed on a wall punish AND he has a  damage combo for max damage when he knocks a player down. Thats pretty damn good. ,forhonor,dfoqhxj,1,t5_38p4n

11423714,0,t3_632sqa,By properly do you mean general tips or how to cheese in high level duels? Cuz I can do the former.As far as gear goes just as a note Execution Health Regen Block Damage and Block Damage Resistance are largely uselss the first two because they have minimal effect and the third because due to Superior Block you dont actually take chip damage unless you use Full Block.Also sadly there isnt a lot you can do outside of shield bash into a light or two against higher level people as overall Conqueror is average speed at best and aside from charged heavy attacks has some of the lowest overall damage in the game.Aside from that a few notes on what you CAN do When you dodge forwards or sideways your guard shifts to block in that direction so you can do it to do a deflect of sorts into a shield bash. Your heavy attacks have a surprisingly damn good lunge range Ive hit people with fully charged heavies just based on the fact they thought they were well out of range. You can get guardbreaks off your Superior Blocks if you time it right. Against people who dont know how to dodge it if you can get the pressure started alternating between shield bashes and heavy attacks can take off a good part of your enemys health. While you cant parry or guard break counter while charging a heavy attack you can still block and you can block attacks during the start up of your heavies so if you time your charged heavies right you can get a parry of sorts. Look out for people who do know how to dodge. As much as people complain how safe it is there are some characters who CAN punish your shield bash on a dodge if they get the timing down. Look out for Raiders can GB out of dodges Kensei other Conquerors Peacekeepers Berserkers Orochis Lawbringers and Valkyries. ...I am not a good teacher so these were all the tips that immediately came to mind hopefully someone else can come and elaborate on things.,forhonor,dfqv7hs,2,t5_38p4n

Even in regular duel times you dont get enough the xp difference for losing vs. winning is absolutely negligible meaning that there isnt even an incentive to win how it is currently! I want to say the difference between a win and a loss is less than  xp. Plus in every game that has XP sort of based on time I havent heard of anyone actually sitting there and doing nothing because you still get less xp from doing nothing than trying to finish the game and get a match complete bonus and a win bonus. In addition to sitting around not even being fun.

11444309,0,t3_5vwrq7,What the actual hell? There is so very much wrong with this post and I cant believe people actually are accepting of this. Firstly the extra gear variation how do you perpose you would level up gear then? Thats the whole point of leveling the gear? I dont get what adding more variety will do but just make the decision to level up gear or not more confusing. Its fine as is. If anything needs to change in the gear process as far as variables it is that rare gear needs to be more of an in between than it is now or add a new rarity like epic or legendary in between rare and heroic. The only problem I see is too big of a gap between the two rarities. As far as your whole change the stats thing you are COMPLETELY eliminating revenge mode out of the equation. Why would anyone suffer a loss to base stats for a stat they cant even get now because you clumped the revenge gain with revenge mode variables? It is MAJORLY counter intuitive and you make anything other than straight base stats a poor decision easily.  Again there would be absolutely no point to choose between the staminas because why not just reduce it the cost? Its the same thing except youd never have to wait? Again a stupidly obvious choice. No we just need more options! Now I purpose a new item and that we add  new things to really make the choices tougher not to mention boost block damage and block resistance variables and just change some things around but only slightly. The  things I say we add?These will also adress the biggest complaints spam unblockable grabs and pushes and of course pushing you off bridges and towers.NEW PERPOSALS Strength your opponent takes slightly longer to gain their balance after a parry grab or throw. Balance the opposite of strength. Reduces the time to recover parry grab or throw and while close to an edge increases your chance of not falling from any type of attackBattle Experience you gain bonus percent of renoun at a very small percentage for everything you gain renown for. AND THE BEST ONE to reduce unskillful boring fightsFall resistance when you fall or perform aerial attack the amount of damage you take from the fall is reducedHOW THE GEAR NOW WOULD LOOK?HANDS new item. feat cooldown debuff res revive speedSHOULDERS. sprint speed throw distance excecution health regHEAD. Block damage res battle experience revengedurationCHEST. Block damage stamina regen fall resWEAPON . Attack defense staminaWEAPON . revenge mode att revenge gain injury balanceWEAPON . Revenge mode def revenge gain def strengthHows these? The other things you said were just too easy and pushed revenge out of the picture. This adds more complexity and style per player to the game.

Hit dodge as the sweep winds up but nothing happens and I eat it.  It doesnt happen every time though it appears to occur when my dudes been busy trying to move his guard intime.

If I just sit there all nonchallant doing nothing except avoiding the occasional block and eat lights the sweep is quite easy to dodge.  If I try to mixup my stance and block at the last second or if you throw in some parry attempts that dont connect dodging the sweep isnt always consistent.  It may just be that Sweep is able to highlight some of these oddities easiest due to the tight timing.

Often times when ganking the Shugokis competence becomes severely reduced and their combat reverts to unblockable heavies and demon hugs. Parry the heavies side step the hugs and the moment his health is depleted hit him with youre light. A single point of damage can kill him at this point.

Having to farm  weeks for a k outfit is ok because its supposed to represent the elite that spent a lot of time on this char but having to farm half this cost for a little emote is too tough imo. Also the part on sucking ubis cock is way more about the submissiveness of some players that keep defending ubi abuses the fucking reactionnaries that play the white knights because it became a trend to bash ubi while its plainly justified nothing homophobic lol.I keep thinking a lot of people that play this game arent here just for pure gameplay right ?

11499697,0,t3_643r6f,LOL WHAT?? Seriously this game mode is MEANT to be chaotic with all the powerups running not running ganking whatever. By design it is supposed to be different than just dueling. If you keep getting owned by people who run for powerups bc you refuse to do the same then youre simply being stubborn and refusing to adapt to how the game mode is meant to be played and the loss or lack of fun is on you. And thats ok. Thats why there are multiple game modes for us all to enjoy. Not every game mode is going to appeal to everyone or be in line with someones play style. Personally I like the change of pace. You want to run for a powerup? Cool Im gonna chase you and throw you off a ledge. Or run to a different powerup. Or gang up on your buddy that you left hanging bc you ran for a powerup first. Maybe adding another game mode to suit your needs would be a possible compromise but killing this game mode as it is especially when there are many of us who enjoy the hell out of it is a step toward watering down the variety of the game as a whole. ,forhonor,dfzho1h,24,t5_38p4n

11529349,0,t1_dg2ujzd,Right from the post itself. You let him enter your attack range with shoulder bash.Another fantastic option for punishing a warden who keeps throwing out shoulder bashes from neutral is spacing. Ideally you want to sit just outside attacking range and throw a light anytime you see him release the shoulder bash. What happens is he is out of range to cancel into a parry because if he cancels you are out of attack range but if he commits into either a light bash or guard break out of bash your light will hit him on his way in shutting down those options. If he full charges and begins his forward bash movement you should have time to react to him fully charging his bash and be ready to dodge it and claim your free guard break.  ,forhonor,dg2uqrd,1,t5_38p4n

11530390,0,t1_dg2rfk7,I didnt understand it before I tried and did it.What actually happens Raider is the only class that can chain a side dodge into a guard break  cancelling the end of the dodge animation and recovery. If you see the enemy guard break you while you are in the middle of your dodge and then try to time it like a normal guard break counter  it wont work. What you have to do is to hit your guard break button before the enemys GB connects  thus cancelling your dodge with its dodge properties into your own guard break startup  and then CGB your way out of enemys GB normally by pressing GB again or just mashing it. Thats also why this tech wast discovered before the CGB patch  it simply didnt exist.Ubi pls dont patch it out. Its an example of true tech  clever unintended but fair and proper use of intended abilities and thats coming from someone who refuses to use zone attacks because of the indicator glitch.,forhonor,dg2yzs0,4,t5_38p4n

11548892,0,t1_dg4nr7c,Just copypasting a comment I made in another threadWhat I believe is needed is a tightening of the window in which it can be canceled into the guard break. As it stands now youre able to cancel into a guard break at any point during the chargingup period of the shoulder bash as well as after the first step or two. Its the added extra steps in addition to GBs occasionally silly vacuum effect that gives the SBGBcancel such punishing range. Its because of this added range that the guessing game of wardens shoulder bash turns into the warden being able to use the shoulder bash cancel into GB on reaction as opposed to on prediction to punish a dodge.A good warden is going to charge his shoulder bash until you dodge release and GB after the step to punish the dodge with inflated GB range. However its important to note that you can still unlock gt roll out of it instead of dodging so its never guaranteed damage Yes it costs stamina stamina regenerates health mostly does not. That said it makes the mix up much much harder to punish than I feel it should be.Making the warden unable to GBcancel after the movement of a shoulder bash begins would greatly reduce the warden vortexs noobstomping potential and make it into an actual game of predictions.One important note I want to add is that I dont agree with altering the window in which you can hard feint. As I say in the beginning of this post you are able to cancel into guard break at almost any point during the charge until after the first couple of steps. The same is not true for feinting the window to actually feint SB is considerably tighter than it is for the GBcancel. Its this ability to feint SB that allows the warden to maintain the adaptability and mindgames that are core to his design.,forhonor,dg52ips,3,t5_38p4n

11559997,0,t3_64zcul,I completely agree with you. I feel like the heads at Ubisoft behind the whole steel grind told the devs they wanted all these reps with unlockables behind them  and the devs scrambled to put color pallets sprinkled here and there. It feels so half assed that the first  reps showers you with unlockables but after that you grind for ever to get a slightly different shade of color. It needs to be reworked.

11634118,0,t1_dgeewho,ohh i see. yeah since kensei doesnt have many mixup variations you will find yourself unintentionally doing the same moves sometimes. so for kensei i feel doing the same moves isnt too much the problem you can do the same moves the whole time of course not against really good players but consistetly changing your TIMING on those moves with kensei on the fly is key. As far as your problem with feints maybe try switching your feint button to a button on top like L so you dont have to lift your thumb from guard to do it it will feel weird at first but in the end it will be much smoother transitioning feints because your thumb can stay on the stick while switching guards. also btw try out zone attack feint to helm splitter or to side dodge light. its a gem that most kenseis are slept on and it looks so fancy that it usually confuses the shit outta people leaving them open for a short follow up combo.,forhonor,dgeqna4,1,t5_38p4n

11635577,0,t3_65wx42,The gameplay and aesthetics are very appealing but at a decent skill level all enjoyment just gets sucked out of the game.You get punished for attacking and even playing feint mind games often arent enough depending on your hero. Playing a lowtier hero and feinting gives you a chance to win but playing a toptier and feinting makes you a nightmare. Playing anything other than a toptier makes you feel so hopelessly outmatched that you might as well not even bother playing at all.It rarely feels like youve been beaten because the opponent is better than you. More often than not it feels like you lost because you were playing a lowtier hero against one of the few top tier heroes or because you have a slow guard change speed even other low tier heroes instantly become a nightmare to deal with. Or better yet the mechanics dont even work properly and your supposedly guaranteed attacks after a parry just get straight up blocked.Then theres the obviously broken feats and gearstats in v modes. Even despite the revenge nerfs some classes can still endlessly stunlock you to death with revenge or someone like Warlord becomes impossible to kill with feats while others spam endless full health revives that take less than a second to get someone up after spending a minute or so fighting them.The game has too much bullshit and doesnt feel even remotely balanced or fair. Its occasionally fun when you play against a matchup that gives both characters a decent chance against each other but the majority of the time this isnt the case. The combat system is conceptually great but the devs need to make significant changes to balance the game overall.,forhonor,dgewlvh,1,t5_38p4n

11666142,0,t3_66ggp8,This might be related.When you get GBed you are essentially without a guard stance. If you are too quick to push the stick up to block ex. a Warden doing a top heavy it is not guaranteed on gb then your guard might not change. Thus if you keep the stick in the same position you will never change guard to top. I have noticed this with assassin classes. And it has killed me a few times because I dont realize that I was to fast to input my guard and as a result my character stays in neutral until I do a guard input again. This might be the same input buffer issue since it fails to change your guard if you input too early. ,forhonor,dgideyb,3,t5_38p4n

11668681,0,t3_66i6dp,It would suck to die from chip damage but it is definitely a solution to turtling. Maybe not a flat percentage however and more of a percentage amount based off how much damage the attack originally isFor example lets say the Kensei top light is  dmg and lets say the chip damage is  of that so itll do  dmg. But then if the Kensei did a top heavy worth lets say  dmg a  chip damage would be  dmg! The strength of some classes lights. So instead of a  chip damage on his heavy it should be like a  chip damage doing around  dmg. And stuff like this for every character so that shugokis chip damage is more than peacekeepers etc. ,forhonor,dginsj1,2,t5_38p4n

11673285,0,t1_dgj5jw4,I get your comment about the que but its uses arent just with the block. With certain moves yes some characters use the que to eliminate input delay. A good example would be Raider and Shugoki light parry. Shugoki can get a heavy off light parries but only if he switches guards. Ie side light parry  top heavy Top light parry  side heavy. This is even more evident with Raider when you go for any parry and want to do the punish. Youd have to que left while youre parrying so that it puts you in a position to get the side heavy to zone attack. Also Im not saying that you should train yourself to needlessly eat an attack. Thats where I agree that they should fix the issue with blocking. Its happened to me less because if the first hit already registered Im still not trying to shift my guard to block it. The problem is if the connection is bad and youre on console. With less time to react youre really going to be playing catch up which is why this bug is happening in the first place. ,forhonor,dgj6llu,1,t5_38p4n

Also your headbutt is slower and if you miss then youre gonna take a lot longer to recover.The raider hasnt changed at all.This is all due to this whiny community convincing Ubi to use nerfing as their primary mode of complaint control.Edit on the enemy side they buffed the PKs light attack speed such that it can be spammed and cheese almost every hero out there.

It still delays that action to a maximum of ms between  and  fps.Lets say you have bad luck that an enemies attack starts right after a frame switch which gives you a ms delay in your reaction time. Then you manage to do that input right after a frame switch which gives you another ms delay before your computer does the input though this depends heavily on how things are programmed. Which gives a maximum of ms. Though that chance to happen is .I think I have to clarify once again that I dont say moving to  fps wont help it sure would... it just wouldnt be a magical cure people believe it is cause theres tons of other factors in.

Once youve got it down or feel comfortable enough with it find you a character that you like which sounds like you already have and then look up not only combos but also playstyles. Theres plenty of different text guides as well like the For Honor Legends. Then its time to practice some more. I went straight to Dominion but the mode you choose is all preference. Be patient with the game as its not something you master overnight. If you play duels learn from your losses and try to refrain from raging to much even if you get envirokilled  or spammed with a cheesy combo. Lastly to wrap this up if you play with a character and feel like you arent making too much progress with them dont be afraid to try another character. ,forhonor,dgwdx0v,1,t5_38p4n

11801142,0,t3_68c3nc,Theres been server issues I think due to them trying to get joinable postgame lobbies working and none of the vs. AI are tied to them. If you pause during any vs. AI itll actually stop the game showing that its only in your client.They gave everybody champ status for  days to compensate for whatever expsteelgear youre not getting from the few times youve probably played before finding out.Honestly if its true that its because theyre working on the netcode and trying to make it more fluid with people joining after games are over rather than requeueing then they can take all the time they need as far as Im concerned.,forhonor,dgxp80r,1,t5_38p4n

Win or lose I think it would be cool to earn some kind of commander or veteran status during a season if you personally deploy a substantial amount of assests that way even if you dont win the whole collection if your side loses you at least win something to wear with pride if you actually worked your butt off to participate all season and your side still fails to win. ,forhonor,dgyb0dz,1,t5_38p4n
11807808,0,t1_dgyd8xu,Wardens zone is  or  frames faster than orochis zone. Orochi has two viable attacks top light and zone. People do not generally have a problem with either. Wardens Zone is the only one punishable from block. Orochis definitely doesnt need to be. It would make him almost useless. What I do when playing against orochi is watch for animation not indicator. Only time he drops to the ground is when he zones. Either parry it or block it.,forhonor,dgygfak,-1,t5_38p4n
