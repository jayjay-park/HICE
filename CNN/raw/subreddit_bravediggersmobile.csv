8255990,0,t3_4rnoaa,Im going with yes.  Ive reordered my characters to put the skills I want first and they fire more often for sure.For example I had Lead Customer Service with No Copying No Pasting  chance to CRIT  in the second slot and that skill fired a lot.When I wanted my more powerful skills and heals to happen more often I moved him to the bottom and now I rarely if ever see it come up.,bravediggersmobile,d59k076,1,t5_3e907
8474499,0,t3_4vhdty,Ive got a level  arthur dayum. It looks like it may go forever but perhaps it has a cap at ? The main character is a bit interesting. In general yeah hes way weaker than even epic heroes. But hes got a couple things going for him the first being that you can max out his weapon to  rather easily. Secondly items that provide dmg buffs ONLY work on your main. So if you spend enough time farming items your main can be stronger than your other heroes. Finally as previously mentioned they hold your karmablade. If youve got an ability you care about on there hes great. Angel parry blade is good and blade of bravery and kings domain are great stat buffs. But theyre all outclassed by heroes...In the end I think youll ditch your main. But that will not happen for a very very long time so dont feel bad investing in them OH! Theres also pacts and interestingly your main has a term  pact rather than just the usual... so they may be worthwhile when that comes out. ,bravediggersmobile,d60uqui,1,t5_3e907
8484585,0,t1_d623d3n,Itll be under the hire scroll tab on the bottom one to the left of the heros icon. Its the most expensive gem hire but Ive even gotten multiple legendaries in one pull before. Could just be lucky though not sure since I havent done it many times due to the cost and that you end up having to wait a long time to do it. I dont remember if theres a certain amount of tries you get or if its the same as your free retire period but later its going to make you wait like a week before you can do it again.,bravediggersmobile,d624anp,2,t5_3e907
