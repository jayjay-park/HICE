Finding your style and voice is a la carte you dont take on one single theory as a whole. Youre going to come across various philosophies and you get to pick and choose parts of each one to fit you. There are few hard absolutes and even within a subgenre e.g. oneliner vs long form theres a lot of leeway.Also yes perhaps analyzing humor may not be interesting to the general public but as long as youre doing this in the privacy of your home and not on stage or the writers room that shouldnt be a problem. Explaining a joke may ruin it but youre not explaining jokes or scripts youre writing them.Go ahead and pick up as many skills as possible. But remember knowledge only becomes a skill if you put it into practice. Dont stop writing!,comedywriting,ci64uae,2,t5_2sj66

However I have done the whole writing program Level    culminating in a writer produced show and found the experience immeasurably helpful. The program runs the gamut from the basic sketch structure to the various types of sketches to rewrites to staging your own sketch comedy revue. Level  is where you write the show and Level  is producing the show. In my experience You only become a good comedy writer by writing a lot of bad comedy. You only become a working comedy writer by the connections you make.I got my first writing gig through someone I met at SC Chicago and every working writer I know has a similar story.  If you love comedy and its something you can make that commitment too I would definitely say go for it. ,comedywriting,clxa10q,2,t5_2sj66

3826798,0,t3_349gfj,Walking in to my house I knew something was awry. Three unicorns parked outside my house eating my grass and shitting all over my yard. My front door which leads directly to my living room was unlocked welcoming me to another boring couple of hours in what I call my life. Honey Im home! I shout sarcastically. Three angels sitting in my living room  their faces painted eager. Sit down Mitchell. We have much to discuss.This has happened before. These three bores turn up like clockwork trying to get me to alter my lifestyle. A lifestyle I very much enjoy I should add. Angel Clive one of the first angels to ever take an interest in me removes a large slab of stone from the inside of his robe and holds it high above his head like Link finding a sword for the first time. A small red dot appears on the stone pointing towards the first inscription I am the Lord thy God. Its Dave the Angel with his laser pen.First things first Im the realest. exclaims Dave much to the enjoyment of the other angels. You know like Iggy Azalea? Its like Iggy Azalea Mitchell.Welcome everybody. This is the reality of having Guardian Angels.As you know by now rule  must always be announced and understood before proceedings can well proceed. God is life. God is eternal. God is love. All three angels gently sweep the floor with their right hand make a cross on their chests kiss their fingers and point towards the sky. Every sportsman has got this spot on by the way. I have no idea how.The laser pointer moves down.  Mitchell. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. We have gone through this before so why do you still insist on calling yourself the God of Mario Karts?Pick up that pad and Ill show youAngel John motioned to pick up the pad. He always does. Hes like that one friend who even though he knows he is going to be beaten in to furious rage he will always play.Angel John no! His Rainbow Road game is too strong we have been witness to this in the past. Whilst we acknowledge your prowess we must insist you drop the God title from your nickname. It says right here on this large slab of stone that you arent allowed to do that. Do I require a larger laser pointer?Im not dropping the God moniker until John over there picks up the pad and beats meAngel John instantly goes for the pad. JOHN I SAID NO! bellows Angel Dave.The laser pointer shoots down to the inscription Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. May I ask Mitchell just how have you been keeping the sabbath day holy?I havent. Im not even sure how to keep the sabbath day holy.Hes not sure how to keep the sabbath day holy. Angel Clive enlighten Mitchell for me pleaseAngel Clive still holding the heavy slab of stone above his head looked a little puzzled. Well on the seventh day God rested. Which was good. So I rest too. Bit of Playstation  and just pig out. I really like the HD remake of The Last of Us.Angel Dave looked bemused. Are you fucking kidding Angel Clive? Yes the Last of Us HD remake was very very good but we arent here to discuss Playstation . Were here to make Mitchell a better person. Just start keeping the sabbath day holy. Go to church or something. MOVING ON.Out of the corner of my eye I can see John now has hold of the GameCube pad he was denied earlier on. I know you can hear me Mitchell. Im a fucking Angel. Telepathy is one of my many talents. Im going to wreck you on Karts the second this farce of an intervention finishes. Ill be playing the harp for the final lap such will be the magnitude of my destruction. Eternal damnation via the power of red shells ..Angel Dave interrupts .. Angel John we can all hear everything youre saying to Mitchell telepathically. We are Angels too. We have identical powers. He beats you every time you play him.This time will be differentIts never different Angel John. You play you get beat you say the game is fake and then go home.I dont want to hold the slab anymore admits Angel Clive.You see what you have caused Angel John? Now Angel Clive doesnt want to hold the slab anymore. Can you remember how long it took us to convince him to hold the slab?I just want one shot at him on Rainbow Road. adamantly states Angel John.Fine. Boot the GameCube up. But after the God of Karts beats you we are going through the Commandments again.,comedywriting,cqshjr6,3,t5_2sj66

5276827,0,t1_cvlzsev,Yes like nearly everything some people will naturally be predisposed toward an activity. But also like nearly everything you can become fantastic at a thing by practicing. Heres your assignment. Get a newspaper  or anything that has words on it which you can also write on  and write ideas on it. You use the information in the paper for inspiration. Maybe there is a story that is strange to you. Maybe the story is normal but theres an unusual detail. Maybe the story is normal but you have an of how it could be funny. Maybe theres nothing funny about a story but it reminds you of something that is funny. Theres no right answer. Read stories allow the smallest detail to get you thinking about something new to generate ideas.Dont go searching for the perfect idea right off the bat just put pen to paper and write down a lot of things. Circle words that are amusing to you. Or names. Or ideas. All the while thinking is this something? If its not. Thats cool. If it is make a note of it. Do this every day. Or a few times a week. At the end of the week go through your stack of papers or your note book and pick out the good ideas. Now youve got a dozen ideas that could be comedy. Write one of then.,comedywriting,cvm6aw9,2,t5_2sj66

Mike looks like hes in pain.MIKEOw. Ow OW! Ok Im going.Mike exits. Kate puts down the book reaches under the covers and pulls out an Indiana Jones Whip.KATEThanks babe!Blackout.The bloody legs kinda makes me think more of the actual implications of whipping human beings. Plus it implies that her pussy can cause physical injuries. I think its funnier and a clearer gag if the Pussy is USING a whip. Thats why I made that change.,comedywriting,d3akzu1,2,t5_2sj66
