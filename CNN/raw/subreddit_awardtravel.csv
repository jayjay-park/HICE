3258628,0,t3_2x9s0h,So...you paid for an economy ticket and want to fly in business? Right because airlines are in the business of giving people free upgrades. Oversold situations can occur but the airline may upgrade passengers to make room for other passengers for various operational reasons.Perhaps work for the airline or have an immediate family member work for the airline? Airline employees and their immediate family members often get nonrevenue travel privileges and are often allowed to travel NRSA in premium cabins. Business fares on the DFWLHR fare usually range between  for restricted I fares. I believe a counter or kioskoffered LFBU from YgtJ is  cash for the route. That is another way but in general you get what you pay for and people do pay for business. DFWLHR is a lucrative and eliteheavy route for AA the two flights tomorrow are completely zeroed out in all classes with a total  business seats open which are likely to get filled later on. K miles does not seem particularly exorbitant to me how much is sitting in a J seat worth to you?By the way I checked ExpertFlyer for advance available C inventory for you on the DFWLHR route on every day in March. Unless you are flying in the first three days there is only C on AA on  for all of March. If you must waitlist your chances of clearing a milescopay upgrade vary depending on the exact day and flight but as a PLT requesting late it would be on the lower end of the spectrum.,awardtravel,cozrnre,2,t5_35rd5

Their As have a more advanced recliner style seat mix between an angle lie flat and a standard recliner  check out Seat Guru for pics though I doubt the short HKGSGN route would have an A on it.If it is a CX flight like uTangoAlpha mentioned the type of aircraft is going to be dependent here. CX flies nothing but widebody jets though some have what they refer to as regional configurations to them. The regional configuration aircraft are going to have angle lie flat or recliner seats while the international configuration i.e. any flight that isnt called a regional configuration will generally all have fully lie flat seats in a reverse herringbone pattern. The reverse herringbone seats are widely considered the best J hard product around. I generally go out of my way to fly CX routes with this configuration because I find it to be extremely comfortable. With that said CX is well known for equipment swaps so just because youre booked onto a flight with the reverse herringbone seats does not mean thats ultimately the aircraft you will end up flying.To answer your question on if its worth it thats really a subjective question that only you can answer. For me yes I personally think it is worth it for a . hour flight to pay up to J. With that said I have a few hundred thousand Avios and Im  so I value legroom greatly and have the miles to burn to boot. ,awardtravel,cyyao7t,2,t5_35rd5

If you were looking for shoulder or off season you probably wouldnt be having as many problems  youre travelling when lots of others also want to travel   Ill throw one idea out there in which you may or may not have an interest.  If you found a saver award going to Paris that would work for you you could consider flying back to the US on Icelandair with a day stopover in Reykjavik.  Icelandair is one of the few airlines that doesnt charge ridiculous one way prices tofrom Europe and they allow Iceland stopovers.  Youd have to fly PARDEN and could build in a stopover at KEF.  Then Im sure you could find an award or cheap flight nonstop DENABQ on Southwest.  I see some select dates in July for a little over person.  If you could work with one of those dates youd be looking at k URperson on an award to fly over probably around k URperson for a Southwest award and ishperson to fly Icelandair.

DL showed space for  on a flight I needed. Tried to book and no dice. Called DL and was told space was gone. HUCA and was told space was there but they couldnt book it and there was nothing they could read would do about it.Its frustrating but it is unfortunately a part of the game. Its important to keep  things in mind in this game  the frustration is a large part of the price of admission that we have to pay for the mere pennies on the dollar we often pay for these premium cabin redemptions we may never otherwise be able to afford to experience and  the struggle makes walking on to that plane and taking your seat that much more rewarding.,awardtravel,d366l48,3,t5_35rd5

Let me save you the trouble flying economy on points to Bali is almost never worth it unless you really really cant afford the price. Its just too many points for that low of a cash price. I would save the points and pay cash for the flights unless you are really short on cash. Also if you can take more time off its really really worth it to stay in Bali for longer. Bali is very diverse and there is a ton to see. Plus its super cheap. You can get a private villa for  a night in most towns or a no frills room or homestay for  a night.

9779311,0,t1_dai6iqn,Look  Im not trying to pick a fight here and Im not making any statements about anyones religion. There are some countries where people living in them look more for value in air tickets than other places. The Netherlands is one such country which is why its easier to get award tickets to almost anywhere neighboring The Netherlands despite more available flightsI often fly into and out of Dusseldorf instead Israel is another and India is a third. This is a thread about it being hard to book award tickets to Israel. I think the fact that there is more competition for award seats than average is a valid and reasonable factor to consider and Im not going to back away from this.Where do people not look so closely for award seats? China oddly enoughChinese carriers are awash in award seats although there is heavy competition on cash fares which are so cheap awards dont usually make much sense. Dubai where you can fly almost whenever you want on Emirates awards. Andbelieve it or notMexico. If you cant find awards from the US check from Mexican airports you will often be surprised at how much availability there is.,awardtravel,daiik56,3,t5_35rd5

9851171,0,t3_5gdy0f,I just booked my two free nights for Spring Break  at Zilara Cancun.note Zilara is  while Ziva is for families. Is your family all ? I havent personally been to either hotel but from what Ive heard the Zilara is much more relaxing less screaming children although both offer many of the same great amenities.There may be limits placed by the individual hotel but in general if you can see a standard night available in cash then you can book it with the cert. Each cert states it is good for a single room double occupancy but I was able to book on the phone and confirm my room for  people allinclusive! I managed to snag some AA business tix LAXgtCUN last month. Id say booking aeromexico via the Chase portal would be your best bet since you have the CSR or you could look into some WN flights if youre looking for more flexibility since theyre fully cancellable.I had no problem arranging this whole trip less than  months out. Christmas may be hectic but I would think that Spring Break would be busier. Best to err on the side of caution and get the Hyatt cc sooner rather than later. Even if you end up not pursuing this Cancun plan I can promise you that you will find value in the  free nights ,awardtravel,darmp8n,5,t5_35rd5

If you wanted to loop from Paris to Nice then up through Milan to Zurich then Munich and back to Paris it would be possible but theres no way you could fit Spain in and unless you book night trains youll be spending a solid chunk of your vacation on trains.  Id suggest that you focus on one big country other than France and smaller ones that are grouped with them.  So if you prefer Spain you could also go to Portugal and Morocco.  Italy tack on Switzerland.  Germany either Switzerland or Benelux this is the one that Id recommend for your situation. So a nice compact visit could be Paris to Geneva Geneva to Zurich Zurich to Munich Munich to Frankfurt or Cologne then back to CDG.  Or skip Geneva and Zurich and substitute  Amsterdam and Brussels.

10951943,0,t3_5w2y4p,Ive been Marriott Gold for a few years and used to travel a lot for work. The rewards are. Preferences when you make the booking in terms of  of beds high floor  low floor etc.  these are basically guaranteed if theres availability.. Room upgrades  usually as gold you get upgraded to the nicest possible room that is still generally in your category. So if you book a  double bed or  king bed room youll probably get upgraded to the club level or get a corner room or get a view or some combination but youll likely still have a room with  double beds or  king bed. Ive never gotten upgraded to a really nice suite or anything like that my friend who is platinum gets those upgrades sometimes.. For the free breakfast  club lounge access it depends on the class of hotel you are booking. Basically you will always get free breakfast if the hotel actually has breakfast I think some of their really really low tier hotels like TownePlace Suites dont always have breakfast. You are guaranteed club lounge access if you book at a midtier or luxury class hotel that would be expected to have a club lounge so Marriott JW Marriott Autograph Collection etc. with a small handful of exceptions. If the club lounge is closed or something then youll get some points as compensation.Also keep in mind that their cancellation policy on point redemptions is pretty generous usually you get a full refund up to  days before the reservation start date. I frequently book point redemptions if available while still searching for other better deals  theres really no downside.,awardtravel,de9m5mv,2,t5_35rd5

For each k points you transfer from SPG to an airline SPG gives you an extra k airline points on top of that. You could also try booking it as two oneways oneway from DME to NRT and oneway from NRT to SAN which shouldnt be a violation with AA.

If you use Chase UR points as cash for that . cents per point redemption one way will most likely be more expensive than buying round trip. So something like  for one way and  for roundtrip. But hey family emergency what you gotta do you gotta do.So I would recommend using something like awardhacker to find out how many miles it would cost to fly one way back on a partnered airline vs how much a one way cash ticket is minus  so a  one way ticket is .k UR points and see which one is cheaperEdit Im seeing quite a bit of united one way to HKG at  in the upcoming days if you buy that using UR points like cash you would be paying .K points which is not terrible.

11475383,0,t3_63qvyi,Generally its better to transfer points to an airline than use the Chase portal. But sometimes it might make sense to book through there. To get started use awardhacker.com. Plug in your home airport and SEA and take a look at your point options for UR and SPG transfers. The trickiest part is usually finding the right flights and award availability on the dates you want. That should be your first step. Then you can take a look at which hotels are available. Seattle has a number of Hyatt which you can transfer to from UR and SPG properties. I generalljy always stay in Hyatts partly out of brand loyalty and mostly because you can usually get great value out of their points. The Hyatt at Olive  is a great one to check out. Dont worry about arrivaldeparture times. Any hotel will hold your bags if you have an early flight in before check in time or vice versa if you have a late flight out when leaving. If you provide your home airport and dates youre looking at I can try to give you some ideas on what I would do.  ,awardtravel,dfwqaru,4,t5_35rd5
