1941241,0,t1_ckn2nuc,Franklin and Easton true leather editions are considered to be fine modern bindings  This is an accepted fact by most if not all dealers and booksellers.  Are they as collectible as pre leather classics?  Of course not. Are they collectible?  Yes they are frequently the most requested items on Abebooks for one source  Do they retain or increase their value?  yes which is why most fine bookstores have special sections for easton and franklin once again of course they wont increase as much as antique leather titles but they do increase sometimes substantially especially the signed firstsLeather today isnt the same as it used to be I suppose and maybe its just because most books published today are made out of recycled crap as cheaply as possible but Franklin and Easton are considered fine presses by any present definition of the term.the bumps are for looks only usually  the raised band style seems to be a popular gimmick especially for the pleather books to appear more antiquey  franklin and easton have always used them which is why I suppose all the knockoffs barnes borders imitate itI definitely understand not liking easton or franklin especially if you are a fan or collector of premodern handmade book bindings and processes I love blues music but cant stand the ripoffs that started in the s with the Stones Zepplin and such but some people think the latter are better for some reason but they arent discarded turds by any stretch  They are the best available in the modern day publishing world.  ,rarebooks,ckn474l,4,t5_2sgo9

11184212,0,t3_5v2qaa,Ive sold obscure books on concrete for decent  before. I too am intrigued by this sellers offering price for the nd Ed. The rest of their highend inventory doesnt suggest they are in the habit of putting absurd prices on unworthy material. Though their lack of exposition in the description isnt giving us much to support their price. The British Library seems to have the only holding of what might be considered a First Edition though it notes the publication date as . Likewise I could find only a single library holding a physical copy of a nd  Edition. Hmmm. that  copy on amazon is looking mighty tempting.You may have something here though reaching out to the abebooks seller seems your most sensible course of action if you want to know more. What are your goals here simple curiosity? sale? professional estimate? etc...?,rarebooks,dezpube,1,t5_2sgo9
