8844578,0,t3_5169mq,I agree and share your frustration. All that hard work on Saturday flushed down the drain on Sunday because of an inconsistent clutch. Apparently the resolution was supposed to come from the Mercedes road car division in Stuttgart but that was months ago. I just dont understand how this team with all of their partners and access to the RampD of the parent company cant resolve this issue.,lewishamilton,d7azr6o,2,t5_2vmby
