100476,0,t3_1v7snp,If you make it on  count aida rather than the  they recommend it will be larger  stitches per inch instead of  stitches. The size of the pixels is effectively the only difference between different counts of cloth!You will need to buy  colours of floss thread which will be available at most craft stores for less than  each. You will only need one skein bundle of each and they will last you a lot of projects. A wooden or plastic embroidery hoop any size you like really about  inches in diameter will work  about  depending. Other people use something called qsnap frames Ive never seen them for sale here in Australia but theyre meant to be really good Aida cloth  the fabric you stitch stuff onto. It comes in several colours my local places only seem to have white beige and blacknavy. The count is the number of stitches per inch. Generally you find  and  count in stores.  count gives you bigger pixels. Its decently expensive a piece about cmxcm goes for like  or something. But it will last you a couple of projects. Needles  you can use normal needles but you have to rethread them a LOT so an embroidery needle with a big eye is great. Also embroidery needles are blunt so you dont prick yourself.  a couple of bucks or you might already have one at home if you have a variety of differend needles in your sewing kit. A frame to put it in when youre done  I get these last so when Im looking at the frame in the shop I can hold the finished piece to it to ensure its the right size. Or you can get it professionally framed! but this is expensive naturally,CrossStitch,cepvbqz,6,t5_2rpor

1753102,0,t3_2ejojd,I love cross stitch and have been doing it for years.  I find it very satisfying to see a blank canvas come alive with a design. Basic cross stitch can be easy a pattern printed on the cloth that you stitch over.  Counted cross stitch will have plain cloth that you literally count how many stitches to stitch where and in what colors.  The plain x stitch which is most common can be used for all kinds of patterns and is easy to learn. As you go along you can get more detailed adding other kinds of stitches.  I would suggest going to a craft store and buying a beginner kit  something small.  There are pretty good directions in most kits which show step by step how to do various stitches.  You might even find one for kids I know silly but it would be good place to start.  After that you can try harder kits or find patterns and pick your own colors and designs. Depending on where you live a lot of fabricsewing stores offer classes on different kinds of needlework so thats another option.  Do you know anyone who sews?  Sometimes its easier to learn when you can see someone do the stitches. There are probably youtube videos of instructions too.  Its a pretty cool hobby because even though some kits are expensive you can find the aida cloth on sale often and can pick up floss cheap. If you make your own designs or find them for free it really can be inexpensive.  If you are interested I can send you a hoop and some basic supplies.  I have TONS of stuff that even if I sewed for  hours a day for the rest of my life I would never use.  Let me know. ,CrossStitch,ck04xd0,8,t5_2rpor
1758774,0,t3_2elbcw,Wow that is more sparkles than advertised this is nuclearArt!! My only concern would be the transition to the background. The pattern relies on having a transition from bright to dark purple thread to black just fabric... I guess the thread would cover up the sparkles but theyd be fully visible on the blackbackground so it might be a little weird. However you could always go back and stitch black thread over areas that you feel should be darker although this is more work!. So basically I dont know what you should do even though I told you to buy the fabric... and I stand by that because its awesome and it will be great from something maybe this??. Ahhhhhh...

Cutting the paper just exactly to fit was a total pain so I ended up just leaving the back as is. I affixed the hangers with permanent glue dots from the scrapbook aisle at Michaels and put a bit of black gaffer tape over it to keep it neat. I will post a picture of the backs when I get home tonight.Edit to add  I did consider reversing the pattern and stitching the reverse image so I could back it with that and have both sides showing the stitched image.  Then I regained my sanity and moved on.,CrossStitch,clvzkvz,3,t5_2rpor

2560985,0,t3_2p2ry7,The tip  method is not really great especially for bigger projects because you have to bend the fabric in weird ways and you cant use a hoop  it just ends up being a whole lot more trouble than its worth. However that being said I occasionally stitch towels like these and that technique saves so much time and makes it much less of a hassle just because of how soft the fabric is and the holes are a little bigger and it doesnt matter if they stretch a little. It takes a little bit of getting used to but when I started doing towels the normal way putting the needle through to the back then bringing it through to the front it got pretty frustrating because the fabric was so softfloppy that I had to spend way too long on each stitch even with a hoop because the towel was so big that I naturally just started stitching like that...but when I tried to do it with regular aida it didnt work. So tldr it doesnt work with normal aidalarger projects but its great for towels.Ive also never used one strand folded in half  always two and I leave a small tail under  stitches which is not a lot of thread that gets wasted I used to anchor under  stitches because I was paranoid that my threads would get loose...it doesnt make a difference. I never heard of doing one strand folded until a few months ago I tried it and didnt really like it especially since it made it a lot harder to undo stitches if I needed to...but the biggest reason was that Ive been stitching for around  years doing the same technique that I was taught so I didnt really feel like getting into a new habit!

2724488,0,t1_cndjdv8,I used it here as the pattern only called for a single colour and it added some dimension. I had to use two separate threads for each half and work outside inwards to keep the shading consistent. I have a variegated green thread that I use sometimes for leavesplantlike things to add some slight shading.

3526570,0,t3_30o1r1,Im pretty new to cross stitching as well but yeah as far as Ive seen  strands is pretty common though  is sometimes used as well. As far as the french knot is it just for the dot on the i? Its just a different type of stitch but its also pretty difficult to get for most people anyway and you could probably get away with just doing another cross.The little symbols inside each square indicate what color youre supposed to use which you can figure out using the key there on the left but yeah you can definitely lightly shade the pattern if thatll help you! For telling where you left off you can either just eyeball it which is what I do or use a pen or something to mark the ones youve already done. Im not sure if this is the proper way to do it but for me Ill start in the middle with just the first couple colors doing one half of each of the crosses of the color going up from the middle then finishing them on the way down and continuing down to the bottom again doing only the first half of each cross on the bottom half and back up. Then once I have a couple colors started and its easier to use them for reference Ill start my thread wherever it looks like Ill need to jump around least. But like I said I dont know if this is proper or if there is such a thing this is just what seemed easiest to me and Id also be curious to see if there were other more efficient ways to go about it.But that penguin is really cute it looks good!Edit to say that there is also a method called parking that might be helpful to look up though it seems to be hit or miss as far as whether it works for people.,CrossStitch,cpu95ag,1,t5_2rpor

3579017,0,t1_cpzbr26,We should totally start an Everything I Need To Know I Learned From Cross Stitching thread. My lesson is making sure to go ahead and unstitch some work in order to undo the giant knot I didnt realize had formed earlier or undo some rows and restitch it right instead of trying to cover it with more thread of the color it was supposed to be. To be thoughtful with my work and do it right. Im also learning that perfection is impossible so sometimes you have to just keep going and make sure to finish work instead of stopping yourself over every flaw. And the wisdom to know which of the above situations I am in.,CrossStitch,cq08ic4,1,t5_2rpor

It takes some practice to use both hands when stitching but it didnt take me nearly as long as I thought it would.

Im really happy with this way since I know I can pick up most charts and will have the colours on hand without needing to go to the craft store every time I want to begin a new project  So Id say see if you can find a bulk lot or maybe someone has a list of the recommended colours for a beginner set? ,CrossStitch,crpgai2,2,t5_2rpor

7353901,0,t1_d2dijaz,This is what Ive been thinking too if the work is framed with glass its very difficult to make out the extent of the detail and most people would just give it a passing glance whether its done with  or  worth of supplies  But I dont have the DMC color card nor much experience substituting colors so I feel a bit out of my depth here.,CrossStitch,d2e36sg,1,t5_2rpor
7356363,0,t1_d2e332j,No worries! Overdyeds can be a bit fiddly to work with. Dye lots vary wildly and consistency is never in the Plus column. I have times where I do not want to deal with the  hassle of trying to figure out if these particular dye lots go well with the project. It gets worse when you add overdyedhand dyed fabric into the mix!  I have more than a few projects that were stitched with plain DMC because I could not be arsed to deal with overdyeds. PS I have sen Miras stitched on  count and up fabric. You cant add any bling to those as the fabric is too tiny. You can always convert the Kreiniks to DMC and skip the beads. Although I think a few beads are better than none. I cant wait to see what you come up with! ,CrossStitch,d2ed9hq,2,t5_2rpor
7394783,0,t1_d2iizds,Oh good it sounds like its an option without making it too hard to get through the holes.  I will at least try it for now.

7400433,0,t1_d2ip48l,I was taught to iron on high steam underneath a pillowcase. If youre feeling brave you dont have to use the pillowcase but if you do that you have to press instead of rub.

8689928,0,t1_d6qmt2g,Depends on your patience.    My suggestion would be to find a small pattern or kit that you really like look of but slightly intimidates you.  Or if you want a more specific suggestion a traditional sampler might be good for you try more complex spacingcounts and more colors to deal with.  Remember to organize the amp! out of your colors and make copies of your pattern and color chart before you start.  Last but not least secure the edges your fabric!  You can use a whip stitch or a buttonhole stitch my preference or Stitch Fix my lazy preference.  ,CrossStitch,d6rvalk,2,t5_2rpor

10910859,0,t1_de4wn3e,Ive never had any issues pulling waste canvas from large pieces. Make sure you soak the project before you start pulling the canvas it says to do this in the instructions anyways and take your time so your stitches dont get warped. If youre really concerned you could always use soluble waste canvas. Ive never seen pieces large enough for your pattern but you could always use multiple sheets of it and line it up and pin it before you start stitching. I havent tried this yet but I plan to once I finish one of my giant WIPs and I dont see why it wouldnt work. ,CrossStitch,de5dlwu,2,t5_2rpor

10942792,0,t3_5w916b,Im in upstate NY and I usually go to Michaels or AC Moore. Their selection is about the same and theyre right next to each other so if one runs out of something I can just go to the other one. Walmart also has some DMC floss and needles but their colors are very limited and they dont have much more than that. ,CrossStitch,de8o6y8,2,t5_2rpor
10944689,0,t3_5wb6kg,What you are doing is totally ok.  You dont want to run thread across long open spaces on the back it wastes thread and it will probably show thru to the front not good.  Good way to learn that its sometimes about what you have to do and not about what others tell you do.  You got dis.  ,CrossStitch,de8v8hk,3,t5_2rpor

11204081,0,t3_5zxrji,Good work!  Where did you find the pattern?  You did great finding something to start with.  Honestly the big or complex scary ones are just done a stitch at a time too.  You have to find your own comfort level. I am adventurous with it so I do beads and special threads and linen and huge projects but I also do small and fun.  It is a great hobby and soon you too will have a stash you wont be able to dig yourself out from under D  ,CrossStitch,df1yv8j,4,t5_2rpor

Had a heck of a time pulling it off... shades of grey help make this sad little silhouette pop off the aida but trying to count single stitches here and there over the black fabric is a superpower unto itself.  still it was relatively quick to do and Im more than happy with the finished product.

I tend not to use the hoop when doing finishing stuff like French knots since more worried about flattening those. No issues over several large projects. ,CrossStitch,dgu955c,2,t5_2rpor
