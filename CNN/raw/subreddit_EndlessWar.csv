But its not what I meant. In any case of intervention in the ukraine there is room for fuckuppery. Obviously its not a safe or practical idea. But if the US is going intervene with billions of dollars in Iraq Afghanistan and all the like under the pretense of being liberators although yes apparently those countries were threats with the military they could at least send some militaristicornotIdontcare aid to people who genuinely need it.Its not a good idea in a practical sense its a good idea in the moral sense.

But I will answer a point or two starting from the top. gtYes and Russia did the same thing to Georgia. Wrong. Russia was requested to intervene by an autonomous region of Georgia. That region was being squeezed by the American and Israeli backed government of Saakashvili. Russias actions in Ossetia were perfectly legal as were its reactions against Georgian actions into Georgia. gt As the Soviet Union it invaded more countries...bla bla blaRussia is not the Soviet Union. You are reciting neocon talking pointsgt You mean the one that even Russia admitted was necessary four separate times in the UN?First you accuse Russia of illegality and then you use Russia as the authority that proves legality. In the same comment. Lol!The embargo of a country as a preventive measure for accusations that are purely conjecture is illegal under international law whether or not that law has been applied. gtI agree its illegal but at this point many of those imprisoned cannot even go back to their home countries. Theres also no torture thereMany of those imprisoned can go back to their home countries. Their continuing imprisonment is kidnapping. The US government has no right to try men that it has kidnapped and imprisoned unjustly. The trials are a farce and doubly so because the fucking Empire wont release even those men that its kangaroo courts have okd for release. As to the torture  the international court of justice I think thats the right court  I am on a phone and not going to look it up has determined that force feeding prisoners against their will is torture.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has seized control of the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal activists said as it ramped up its eastern Syria operations in an attempt to erase the SyrianIraqi frontier and carve out a protostate. While the group known as Isis appears stalled in its threeweekold offensive in Iraq activists warned that its advances in Syria continued apace leaving President Bashar alAssads forces to watch as the jihadi group sapped the morale of his battered opponents.

Please share this article with others using the link below do not cut amp paste the article.This is the first time Isis holds both sides of an official border crossing which is significant said Rami Abdelrahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He argued Isiss real strength was still in Syria not Iraq where he said it was still unclear how well the group could control territory. Isis has been advancing in Syria for a while and the supplies theyve brought in from Iraq have increased the speed. With Isis fighters bringing back USmade weapons looted from abandoned Iraqi army bases as well as cash seized from banks in cities overrun by insurgents activists in Syria said the group was attracting more pledges of loyalty from undersupplied rebels. A US promise of m last week has not given opposition groups hope of bolstering their forces with previous western aid promises having done little to increase the rebels military capacity. Rebels once argued that Mr Assad and Isis avoided attacking one another because of a shared interest in weakening the opposition. But now the regimes clashes with other rebels appear to have eased as it steps up strikes on Isis positions. The regime which hardly ever used to bomb here has apparently woken up to the fact that Isis is a real threat said Abdelkader alHariri an activist in Isiscontrolled Raqqa province.

But many believe the group has outmanoeuvred them and seized enough resources to fund its drive for a state. Isis controls oil wells and has tapped into power plants in Syria. It is now pushing toward western Iraqs Haditha dam. The group appears be testing the waters around the rural outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Islam Army a Syrian rebel group said one of its media activists and a judge who was a former Isis member had been assassinated in the past week. It also blames Isis for two car bombs in the town of Douma near the capital. However other rebels said there was no proof Isis was behind those attacks and argued it was still weak around the capital.

It would otherwise revert back to a competition among war lords.    If the insurgencies of the Middle East ever break free of US engineering   look out.    It would be another Vietnam style battle.
