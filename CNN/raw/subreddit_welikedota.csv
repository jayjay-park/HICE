8190267,0,t3_4qbo65,One thing to add is mentally checking what youve accomplished in the last minute or  seconds and to develop a game plan for yourself. If what youve done in the last x amount of time isnt enough for you to hit the timings for your game plan think of what you can do in the next  seconds to get back on track. Rarely is a game of Dota completely lost or won on one fight so focusing on breaking the game down into little pieces can help avoid the stack up of mistakes that leads to a loss or continue to build upon the positives for a win. Bit less concrete and certainly will vary per skill level but important thing to consider across all levels.,welikedota,d51c2co,1,t5_30djz

8869017,0,t3_51hffd,Brian I totally get the thing about stressful  full life keeping you from wanting to play DotA. That happens to me in most transitions. Dota is fun but definitely not relaxing. I honestly dont know how people can play it to avoid stress or as an addiction. It requires too much mental and emotional energy for me. I usually use a Diablo or Path of Exile style ARPG for unplugging.,welikedota,d7dxj92,1,t5_30djz

Just keep in mind that you may be forced to play at a ping disadvantage see rules dictating servers USE unless BOTH captains agree on a different server location. This didnt lessen the fun that was had for our team though! Theyll be competing again this year.,welikedota,d7uj60m,1,t5_30djz
