1637978,0,t3_2cujad,Sorry it took so long for me to respond but I kinda forgot about this whole thing.. hahaAnywaysgt Wow Eddie Shin what a great actor. Although they killed off his character I think hes made a lasting impression. Continuing with that the interrogator did a great job as well.Totally! Its a real pity he had to die but the storyline with that guard who killed him also seems very interesting. Maybe we also get to see that guy who interrogated Sid again.gtRachel Brosnahan...so beautiful! I first saw her on The Blacklist.Its just a guess but I think we might soon be having some steamy lesbian sex scenes with Abby and that neighbor because e.g. Charlie is too busy with his job.Atleast thats kinda what I thought was going to happen because Abby seemed like one of those pure characters that are slowly  being corrupted. Also was that weed she got from Liza or some other herbs? It was hard to see for meI agree with all your other points so I wont repeat that.,ManhattanTV,cjlmr61,4,t5_32smb
