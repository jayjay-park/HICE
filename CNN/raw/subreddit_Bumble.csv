6694857,0,t1_d0bq93q,have you even tried using it?  its the best app.  better than tinder okcupid match eharmony and pof put together.welcome to the future of dating where guys stand on the sidelines while women do the picking and choosing.this is a winwin for everyone.  guys no longer have to chase the woman of their dreams instead the woman who feels that shes best for him make the decision for him.  no need for men to think just submit!  and everything will be ok.,Bumble,d0bt18v,1,t5_3531l

7325928,0,t3_4fotat,I experienced something similar when I first started using Bumble. I would receive few matches and a lot of the times guys ignored my messages and those that did respond were creeps. I almost deleted it but I stuck it out and as I started getting more matches and kept messaging Ive found some interesting guys and that Ive enjoyed talking to and even have some dates set up. I would say keep trying to use it for a bit longer and hopefully soon youll get some quality matches!,Bumble,d2awow1,3,t5_3531l
7340938,0,t1_d2cljt5,Thanks.I message almost every match. Theres a rare few that when I review their photos again after their opener something turns me off and I dont reply.I dont follow what you mean by sense of uncertainty. Can you give me an example where it happens?,Bumble,d2cm50d,1,t5_3531l

My best dates and a few relationships have been off of CMB.  I wish they would either pare profiles which I suspect is a problem for CMB or give  chances daily as a lot of the profiles are probably inactive.,Bumble,d41kjdw,1,t5_3531l

8603265,0,t3_4xndi9,you might not care and you might not value it but women love that shit.  theres a question on OKC that asks something like Which of the following do you find to be the most liberating? and the options are something like financial independence travel sexuality art.  most women who answer the question pick travel.  on a psychological level many people equate traveling with freedom because it means you have both money and time.  most people have money or time but rarely both at the same time.but youre also right in asking WTF? because YOU dont value it and it makes you wonder why the hell women do that.  many women are deluded in dating values by modern fem norms... they think that what women value is also valued by highly valuable men.  its not.  men do not look for women to take traditionally male provider roles.  men look for women who are sexually attractive fertile and have a nice personality not bitchy.  women who opt out of relationshipssexuality to build careers andor travel and then end up single in their late s just have little or no value to men.  this is why you see a rise of MGTOWherbivoresgt herbivore is a term used in Japan to describe men who have no interest in getting married or finding a girlfriend.  Surveys of single Japanese men conducted in  found that  of men in their s and  of men in their s considered themselves to be herbivores.This is the kind of shit that causes serious societal level population crashes.,Bumble,d6h0394,5,t5_3531l
8859204,0,t1_d7co078,cause like you guys will right swipe anything. And girls balance that out by being far more selective. Thats the way these apps work. If you re really attractive as a guy its a blast you get  fresh right swipes a day. If you re average to below average fuck it and go do OKCupid or whatever,Bumble,d7cr1u8,4,t5_3531l

8996223,0,t3_537t0a,Yeah every  bios mentions pizza. Now pizza is awesome however since that is a selling point most people are making you gotta have some other information to set you apart.  Youre cute you attempted a bio so that gets you a solid maybe from most women   chance of swipe right. Youre looking for the yes though.  Diverse pictures are good. Campus PD is fine.

Yes its less than ideal but it happens. Why not send another message just to remind her about you? Ive actually had to do the same with men so its not one sided. Just...dont send a message saying so you havent responded lately because that never goes over well. Ask a new question like hey I was just thinking about X and was wondering... or man its been a long week. If you could go anywhere in the world right now where would it be?,Bumble,dcd97fu,2,t5_3531l

10977635,0,t3_5wp3ne,I think people have already said but my advice is dont swipe right on girls you dont like. Thats it. They wont be able to match with you unless YOU swipe right. Once youve done your swiping be patient and wait for new connections. Im no George Clooney either and I dont have a six pack but I get consistent  dates a week from Bumble and its with girls I like and that I swiped right on. Good luck!,Bumble,decajdz,2,t5_3531l

11137611,0,t3_5yzw00,Bumble will from time to time send notifications to the effect of telling women that they have to message first. They have some wording elsewhere that tells you how much time you have left to send a message but most people dont really read things carefully. Everyone I know knows the thing with Bumble is that women message first. Could be new users who just heard of it thought it was like any other dating app and dont really get how it works maybe copied a Tinder profile. ,Bumble,deufqr3,5,t5_3531l

11287280,0,t3_6129lk,gtIm so much in the camp of if you established you are both normal and have at least a couple common things to talk about you should just meet in person.. so I end up just letting conversations die out if theyre not hinting at initiating a date after  days.Are you at least hinting on a date? If you think there might be something there who asked out who first wont matter. If the conversation is going to die anyways whats the harm in asking? gtBecause of the nature of the app being more geared towards girls initiating do you think the girls should be planning the dates as well?I feel like it is at least more flexible. You could always say Im free at X time if you want to hang outmeet up and see if they take the initiative. Or you could go full fledged and plan it yourself. But not trying anything is obviously not working so something else is in order!,Bumble,dfbear3,1,t5_3531l

My first time on bumble was pretty good but that was when I was able to get through all the swipes within a few days. Since then Bumble has grown that was about  months ago.Ive started trying to block Facebook from sending my email to bumble when resetting thinking they might be using that to keep track.

I only find a few interesting profiles within a distance I am willing to try for just casual meetups to see how things go. Even if I selected everyone within that distance and everyone selected me as well I would be meeting at most  men  but it might be a different story in the US. I do swipe further distances now but only for a few that I feel he be might my type and I would be his type as nobody seems interested in chatting more if the distance is inconvenience and there is not a strong initial attraction on both sides and just swiping right for the fun of it when you the distance is mostly likely an issue is a bit stupid and yes I have done it a bit in the beginning but now even the seemingly perfect match I wont be willing to go just meet because bumble works on instant decision to meet and greet and not forming long conversations before meeting.,Bumble,dgsggi2,1,t5_3531l
