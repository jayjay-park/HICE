106009,0,t3_1vb2y5,Stretching every day is the key to loosening up. Im assuming youre talking about the muscles running the front of your leg which would be your quadriceps and hip flexors. You can stretch your quads by standing on one foot and pulling your foot on the other leg up behind you so your heel is touching or as close as you can get it to your arse cheek. You can also stretch them by kneeling down and leaning back as far as you can go with both of your feet underneath you. A good way to get your hip flexors right at the top of your thigh is by getting down on one knee and tilting your pelvis upward. If youre really tight you should aim to hold all stretches for  seconds. Hopefully these descriptions make sense. Im on mobile so its a bit difficult to link images of what I mean. ,MuayThai,ceqi0zd,4,t5_2r60y

The mma term wasnt coined until after the ufc came along and its referring to a rule set that allows virtually all techniques and the cream rises to the top. The reason why there are such obvious deficiencies in mma techniques is because its more beneficial for the most part to focus on other parts of the game or cover up your weaknesses with your strong points. ,MuayThai,ceujo50,0,t5_2r60y

You pretty much force him to defend. If he doesnt its a free kick to the ribs. It will wear out his arms. It is expected that if you have a good training you will wear his arms out before wearing your chins out.

I usually jump around for about two minutes just to start some blood flow and get loose and I start stretching from my shoulders down.

The trainers at our gym might tailor the combosintensity depending on who shows up on that day. But even the more advanced people can benefit from the same combos by focusing on other things like footwork circling out at the end of the combo stepping forward at the start etc. Newer people usually shadowbox or work with the Kru on pads until they can comfortably throw jabs crosses and right kicks while being stable in stance. The combos may feel clunky and awkward at first especially with hooks and knees but with enough practice and listening to the tips from your partnerstrainers itll start to come naturally. ,MuayThai,chgy4d4,2,t5_2r60y

1202765,0,t3_27vx7d,Something Ive been working on in sparring is using an upper as a counter to a body hook. When youre opponent throws maybe a lead body hook at your liver assuming youre both orthodox you kinda keep your right elbow in tight over the area it will hit and turn your whole upper body to the left with their punch while kind of scrunching down a little bit. If done correctly youll deflect the punch and wind up your body to return a counter strike. In this case it would be a lead upper cut but it works on both sides. My description might be a little murky but if you keep your hands in tight dont be reaching and explode up right after their punch hits your shielding arm it works pretty well. Also try what we call a Cuban uppercut where your fist doesnt turn where your palm is facing you. The idea is to connect with the pinkyringmiddle fingers keeping your thumb pointed at your face to make the fist narrower to slip through their guard.,MuayThai,ci4xgq8,3,t5_2r60y

There are a few but one that I like to use is the lead shovel hook to the body or a jab to the body.  These punches start with a lowering of the level to get to the body shot.  First you deliver the body jabshovel hook.  See how they react. Then when you deliver the overhand you lower your body as if you are going to punch their body.  Hopefully you were watching their reaction to the set up punch and they you are fairly confident that they will try to block it.  This should give you the perfect set up to land an overhand right.

2269523,0,t3_2l7f0n,A couple of guys on this sub have trained at Tiger hopefully theyll post and give you a detailed answer about the camp itself.I can answer your other questions.  First off Phuket is one of the most expensive places in Thailand.  Fooddrink is double what it costs in BKK as is everything else.If you are looking for something nice to do outside of camp Id suggest renting a scooter and cruising between Nai Harn beach close to Tiger and Rawaiithere are bars both the traditional kind and the um notorious kind fresh bbq sea food and lots of restaurants.  Most Thai businesses owners speak English.  There also are nightclubs in Phuket town if you are in to that sort of thing.A crazy night out will run you  to K baht whereas a nice meal and drinks will only be around  baht.  You can eat cheap at some street food joints for around  baht.It all depends on your lifestyle.,MuayThai,cls8e59,8,t5_2r60y

You can just tell how much they enjoy coaching and care for their fighters. As the Dutch government also subsidise sports for poor kids its basically available for anyone. Youre better of at a gym with a coach with love for what he does than some moneywhores who will only coach you because youre paying them topdollar. And a good fighter does not make a good coach per s or vice versa. Having a nice collection of motivated fellow fighters to spar with is worth equal or even more than the marginal difference a trainer can make I feel.

The reason I started going there was the exact opposite of yours. They have lots of kids my size  lb kg. Its a Thai family gym more or less. You are probably going to have a hard time finding any Thais to clinch with you that size anywhere in Thailand. You could maybe match up with some of the larger falang. Renting apartments go about  baht a month in the Khaotalo neighborhood which is nearby  renting a motorbike would be must. There are no rooms usually available at the gym. Its a very sweet unpretentious gym and Kru Nu is the best pad holder Ive had in Thailand and Modt Ek a nd pad holder is also excellent but it isnt for everyone. It is probably best for people that want to stay a month or more can train themselves on the bag and elsewise doing their own work selfmotivated but would enjoy the lowkey atmosphere.  ,MuayThai,cnczxum,5,t5_2r60y

2921230,0,t3_2tkll0,When I finished school I knew I wanted to get into teaching. I knew that English would be one subject and I wanted sports to be my second one. However I have scoliosis and was worried that this would make it impossible for me to pass the various tests you have to do when you want to study  sports because it limits my upper body mobility.  So eventually I settled for school psychology.My doc told me that I should look fora  different sport for my healths sake was playing tennis before. Tennis  scoliosis  trouble. He mentioned boxing. So I joined a club at my university and fell in love with it. Around that time I started watching kickboxing and was really impressed with that Buakaw guy steamrolling through people. I noticed one of the guys training without shoes and asked him what he was training. He said he was training the Muay Thai club at university. I should come by if Id like to check it out.  Two weeks later I had found something I loved even more than tennis more than boxing more than any sport I had ever tried before. Soon after I joined a gym and to this day I still think that this is the best gym Im ever going to train at funny knowledgeable coaches also talk about the history of Muay Thai showed us a bit of Muay Boran every now and then brought coaches from Thailand over a few times. I could see my progress. I felt how I got stronger and how my cardio got better and better. I had always gone running but soon my crosscountry seven km route was not something Id do two times a week but a daily run. It was amazing!At this point I had studied for twoand a half years. I was now teaching the Muay Thai club and had managed to get a number of people interested in the sport and try it at the gym. My confidence and fitness was better than it had ever been in my life. When I started studying I couldnt sit through long lectures without my back starting to revolt after  minutes or so. Now I was fit enough to participate in the sacred student tradition of listening for  minutes trying to listen for another  before eventually giving up and enjoying the bittersweet experience of seeping with our eyes open long lectures suck.  Regarding studying I still liked school psychology but I was still looking back at my decision back then. I sort of felt regret for not at least trying. I could not have lived comfortably knowing that that I might have been able to study sports but never went for it because I was too afraid of failing.  So I signed up for the entry test and trained the stuff I had no experience in mostly gymnastics I still suck at that. I thought Id fail because of gymnastics but I managed to somehow get an F. Enough not to outright fail and enough to rack my grade up through swimming and track and field. It worked. That same year I left my old university and signed up at a new one to study English and Sports for teaching. It hurt like hell to leave the Muay Thai club and my old gym behind but I knew I had to do it.And now Im here. I feel good. Studying is fun I have taken up a bunch of hobbies that Im sure I wouldnt have without the confidence boost from Muay Thai most importantly ballroom dancing works pretty well with Muay Thai Ive got to know a whole lot of awesome people I found a new gym with the help of my coach great place even though it isnt as good as my first one and I know that I am where I am supposed to be. Due to the stuff I have to train for sports I cant train Muay Thai as regularly as I would like to. but I still try to go at least two times a week. I actually hope to have my first fight later this year. Nothing certain but Im now able to look at stuff like that in a more relaxed manner than before.Sorry for writing a novel. XD  This is first gym I started training at. If youre ever in the vicinity of Ingolstadt Bavaria Germany check those guys out. I dont know if the Muay Thai coach is currently there since hes recently spent a long time in Thailand but hes an absolute champ. Funniest guy I have ever seen and  great coach too... Man I want to go back there some day.Tldr Muay Thai is awesome. It has given me confidence to strive for my dreams it has made me stronger physically and mentally and it has had a tremendous positive impact on my health.

4160428,0,t3_38ccbx,Look for an organisation called Thai Fight they have a lot of pretty high level fights usually in Thailand itself and a good mix of thai vs thai amp thai vs farang fights. They also occasionally hold fights with Muay Boran style rope wraps can get pretty intense edit stuff like this video quality differs but there are a lot of really good fights under that organisation edit Both of the fighters in that video are very experienced  fights both worth a further youtube search imo. Thats the thing about the top level Nak Muay they have an incredible number of fights under their belts theyve seen and felt it all. What you see a lot in the Thai Fight matches is the farang getting demolished even though they are very good fighters in their own right. With numbers to back it up. And even then they are just not as used to a beating like the Thai especially up close. The elbows is what the Thai are really really really good at and it shows. I was at Thai Fight Koh Samui just this May and most farang were demolished.

I may have a different opinion from most others here I come from a strictly selfdefense background but I dont see this as really a bad thing.As far as learning the intricacies of the sport this probably wasnt the greatest lesson. It WAS however a great lesson in how much punishment you can take and keep throwing punches. You learned what its like to eat some mean punches and have to stay on your feet. These are good things in my limited opinion.As Ive mentioned coming from a selfdefense background and being a smaller dude Ive always seeked to spar and fight the biggest guys I could. Dudes who are double my size and weight class. I didnt always leave a winner but each time I knew I could take a little more pain and fight a little harder than everyone else.I think Winston Churchill once saidA man never knows what hes made of until hes been punched in the face.,MuayThai,cs55h3s,-9,t5_2r60y

Its hard to go into detail about it without being there but there is proper ways to shove someone while still keeping yourself relatively safe from a hook or UC. The whole thing is very situation specific sometimes the guy is just solid and he aint budging. Other times he may know how to properly circle out when you shove in which case now you have to change your angle of attack again.

His body is pretty much in one line with his kicking leg. Really cool style.I dont think theres really a way to teach this. Youll have to try and emulate it yourself. Slow the video down make screenshots of the individual parts of the movement and then try to go through those phases. Find out how they help with the momentum or if they actually help you at all. Record yourself and compare or have someone who understands the technique look at your attempts and correct you according to the video.This is something you have to drill if you want to do it.EDIT When I tried it something that helped me to get this sort of arm swing going was thinkng of doing a motion similar to putting up a high guard against a hook midswing arm against the side of the head.,MuayThai,cyigouy,1,t5_2r60y

You might optimize it a bit more if you really get down to the nitty gritty of dieting and training. Check out Mike Dolce or FitnessVTGeorge Lockhart if you want to really dive into it. They are good nutritionist that help fighters get in great shape.I would however say that the goal to look a certain way is maybe not the greatest goal. Find a way to enjoy the training.

7130541,0,t3_4d0gan,I dont know if it was a northern thing or what but most of my trainers used a chamber  almost like the beginning of a teep  and then threw the kick. They liked to lead with teeps at first to get you scooping or backing up then threw the chambered roundhouse hitting through your dropped guard or hitting you in the trailing leg as you backed up.They used non chambered rounds too but the chambered variant was very common there even without having set up the teep threat.Another odd detail was that they didnt like to pivot too much on the support foot during any version of the kick they tended more towards a  degree turn from  oclock instead of the  or so degrees thats popular here in the US.Not all trainers in the north held to this stuff but the gym I was at had a lot of old school trainers who had been in the northern scene since they were kids so Ive always assumed the differences were regional.

7774665,0,t3_4lg6iw,A couple of basic tips here.Follow them back.  Wait for the longer fighter to throw a jab  teep  cross whatever.  Parry or slip then follow the strike back as they recoil.  If you dont run into their follow up strike youll be inside.  Bang a few out then leave with a strike and on a angle.  Watch out for a guy who knees out of punches or looks to clinch up the second you get inside his guard.  If you are fighting a tall clincher with powerful knees you need to use   Feints.  This ties into the previous idea but maybe your opponent isnt trigger happy and youre having a hard time making him commit enough to follow.  Or youve tried to follow this lanky bastards jab back and met a strong right knee.  Or he just tied you the fuck up once you got inside.  Faint let him react most tall guys will jab or straight punch.  Parry or slip then follow them back.  If you the intercepting knee then let it happen step inside and bang out a few body shots with the quickness.  If hes looking to tie you up his hands with be up high hit that body hard.  Feint but without waiting for their reaction.  So if you feinted but the guy still wont bite he waits for you.  Thats fine now hes still and working his defense.  Attack.  Basic idea feint him into defense then step in and fire.Just make sure that youre entering on angles  feints and leaving on angles or at the very least enter behind your attack and leave on an angle.Some basic ideas all this works better inside a ring then on a open mat.  Im  and fight at  so I know what its like to fight a shorter guy who can negate my reach.  This isnt a strategy more just a move but many tall guys will get lazy with their jab.  They get in love with the safety a long jab can provide and love how they can frustrate with without risking much.  Eventually Im going to get complacent with that.  Use that complacency and fire a cross counter over the top of my weak jab.  Hopping in can work but going to the well with it will get you countered.  Hopping into a hard cross counter is a cheap ticket to the shadow realm.  ,MuayThai,d3px07e,1,t5_2r60y

8048440,0,t3_4pewc7,Something I did early on in Muay Thai when my gym just wasnt cutting it is that I found someone who REALLY knew what they were doing and took private lessons from them at first only once a week and trained the rest of the time on my own at home. Its not ideal but through that I really discovered my love for Muay Thai and it made all the difference. Once I realized how much I really loved it I just kept making room for more and more training whether that was driving longer distances or trying to afford more through a change in priorities. But none of this would have happened if I had just stuck it out at the gym I was really dissatisfied with. ,MuayThai,d4kpxr6,1,t5_2r60y

8095179,0,t3_4pwrrt,Ive trained there twice in three years each time staying about  weeks on site. My training partners at home goes quite frequently as well. I think the training is great and has a strong aggressive style so if you like that style it would be great. Ive was suppose to fight there twice but ended up doing it only once at MBK but it was quite the experience. The people Pornsanae Jun Kongfah Juab Dam San Pee A Mama Lek Abigail the boys are all great. Abigail is a great liaison and can help you get around the towns and will even help schedule day trips for you if you decide to do so on Sundays. Accommodations Training twice a day  meals a day wifi available air conditioned rooms scooters if you need. Dont know what more you need really. The surrounding town small shops fruit food not much else Tesco s farms small temples one coffee shop a sauna temple that is really helpful when you need to sweat it out. A few masseuses in the area. Thursday night markets. Day to day AM training breakfast then you can do whatever you want during the day pm afternoon training dinner then whatever you want. Sunday has no training but meals are still the same. If you are still hungry during the day there are a few local stops to go to. There is not a lot around but it is a quiet lifestyle so make it what you want. If you want to make friends with other foreigners do it and chat. If you want to just be on your own and readwork do it. Make what you will of it. I made friends there that I still talk to today. I have seen guys that taught some of the boys english and learned thai back from them. I have seen guys that just disappear during the days and reappear only during training and maybe a meal. Fight Nights Anytime anyone is fighting the gym will take you to the festival or Bangkok to go watch and cheer on the fighters. It is a fun experience even if the ride is long. Being legit cornerringside is always great since it is legit front row. Tourist stuff Kanchaniburi is about an hour bus ride away which is the largest town around incase you want to hangout and go visit the bridge and to larger bars. Bangkok is a three hour van ride that costs about  baht which is great for weekend visits. Tips After morning training down the road about  lanes down is a small banana grill stand if you need more protein just grab a few grilled eggs sweet potatoes grilled bananas in leaf and coconut water. Thursday night market has all the food you can think of from grilled chickens bugs thai sweets sushi so that is always a fun night and everyone goes. At night the market street has a place that sells great food and a great ginger tea if you are feeling sick. I havent stayed near by but if you are staying longer than a month it might be worth it? I would contact Abigail to see what she recommends she is pretty good at this stuff and can help. There are a few long term foreigners that does that. ,MuayThai,d4pyyva,3,t5_2r60y

8340068,0,t1_d5k19i4,Of course I dont think a man that has mastered the art of Muay Thai over a span of three decades will all of a sudden have unrealistic expectations of another sport. The most important parts of this is Saenchais passion skill and  resources vs age and learning curve. Considering that Rambaa M Dejdamrong sor amnuaysirichoke and Jomhod Kiatadsik are well past their primes but still managed to do well in MMA despite learning BJJ in their s.Rambaas latest fight was a victory last June. He would be  at that time. Jomhod only has one fight but he won it against Viva Vorn a man so popular and skilled to Cambodians that they believed he could beat Yodsanklai Fairtex. But that started to waiver once they saw he couldnt bet a  yr old Jomhod. Im not saying that Saenchai will just cakewalk this like Rambaa seemed to do but some believe that the change is going to end in disaster for Saenchai.

8376079,0,t3_4uain9,A few years ago I was out with a buddy of mine who has trained Muay thai for years and has had a couple pro fights. Some guy tried to start shit with him and he followed us outside. My buddy finally gave in to the guys shit after he pushed my buddy. One swift leg kick sat the guy down on his ass and he put his hands up in the air and said I quit. Im sorry. No more. Thats when I knew I had to learn Muay thai. When it comes to self defense you just have to be smart about what techniques carry over to the street. I would try to avoid throwing heavy punches to the head.

Be more aggressive as well. If you are the aggressor the judges will favor you more. You really dont have much time in an amateur fight so you need to throw as many strikes as you can.

This leads to auto immune diseases.Big insulin spikes identical to sugar consumption.Increased hunger and less sensitivity to over eating.Massive inflammation throughout the body.The easiest way to see that its not safe is just to watch the withdrawal symptoms of someone who stops eating wheat.  Aches hives foggy brain are common.  Even worse is to watch someone who has abstained from wheat eat it again.  They feel ill almost immediately.  I agree there has been wonky and corrupt science around wheat.  Especially the way they handled Celiacs disease.  But much of what ails America can be attributed to dwarf wheat.Just a web article but its properly cited.Not trying to stop you from eating it.  But Im not going to say its healthy in any metric.  ,MuayThai,df3fica,1,t5_2r60y

11479907,0,t1_dfwh7js,So Im still a bit confused. Is the advantage of the Dracula guard is that it offers more protection than a standard long guard? And is that why it better suits Muay Khao fighters? ,MuayThai,dfx8sw1,1,t5_2r60y
11490428,0,t1_dfw4i4u,see if anyone you train with needs anything some shorts ropes wraps etc and split the shipping between you. good way to cut that cost muaythaistuff.com has some cheap shorts that work just fine,MuayThai,dfyfstp,2,t5_2r60y

11564329,0,t3_64vya8,Yeah you just have to train  hours  days a week and do roadwork  fitness.Between a  job training and chores you will have little to no time left.Good thing is once you have a good baseline you can spend less time in the gym for maintenance and only ramp up training for your  week fight camp.,MuayThai,dg6tlib,1,t5_2r60y
11584052,0,t1_dg8zjzg,This right here is the key. I think its best to give up the first round to your equally nervous opponent so you can get the hang of fighting in a ring with lots of people watching you. Relax and breathe. That adrenaline dump is a bitch. ,MuayThai,dg9255f,1,t5_2r60y
