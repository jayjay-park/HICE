408650,0,t3_1yqi1u,Tactical game modes except maybe fire fight as it can drag on for quite a while in some cases or be lighting quick in other cases really need significantly more rounds in my opinion. Its not unusual for those rounds to end in less than two minutes and especially in those cases its not uncommon for matches to go  or . If you take out loading after roundpreround waiting etc that could be only  minutes! It means teams are always scrambling theres lots of downtime from map changes and you dont have time to really get team work going learning the other team etc. I think the match length for tactical game modes should at least be doubled perhaps switching after  rounds? or perhaps go up to best out of  or  as the default. We dont necessarily want all maps to stick around for  plus hour but I feel it should be a fair bit longer than it is now. This would also act as a bandaid until a party system comes in as itd be easier to get  people on the same team and for them to stay together for more than  minutes before the team scrambles. Its a nightmare to play tactical with two or three friends as half the time the first round youre on opposite teams and the teams scramble after  or  more rounds.,insurgency,cfn4g27,1,t5_2s4cy

1612792,0,t1_cjig8kx,Of course it is my personal opinion. Just as in my opinion the first addition of achievements to games is really caused all of this.Now we have people who cant play a game for more than a week before they get bored because there is no replayability despite the fact that the game hasnt changed at all. I was excited when I unlocked Zombie Genocidest for LD. It was a cool achievement  but I would have continued to play regardless of the achievements.Now we can take an amazing game but if it doesnt have achievements unlocks camos we wont play it. If the game isnt constantly rewarding us for playing its not good enough. And I really hate to say the younger generation but I really do believe that to be the case. I dont know anyone around my age who truly cares about those things  they may like them but its not going to make or break the game. But I know PLENTY of people far younger who have been rewarded their entire lives and they wont play a game if that game doesnt constantly hand out rewards. Theyre the same kids who were given trophies even though they didnt make it to the playoffs.Personally for me I play Insurgency because its one of those games that hasnt done any of this yet and it keeps these types of players away. The moment Insurgency caves in and offers unlocks even if its camos  Ill be done playing it. Dont get me wrong I play CoD and BF. Its not that I dont enjoy them. But I enjoy Insurgency because its different and it attracts a different crowd.The same goes for ranking. I dont have any interest in rank. I never have. As many people pointed out in the Steam comments rank ! skill. Rank is only an indicator of hours played. Even the worst player will eventually achieve a high rank.Throw in a ranking system and everyone is going to go alpha mode. Hahahaha youre such a low level gtfo noob v me. Its obnoxious on every other game.CSGO competitive is great the matchmaking is fantastic yes but you know what is terrible about it? The blatant hacking above a certain rank. If you dont believe me start watching demos of every game you play if youre above Master Guardian itll become apparent. Of course not everyone hacks but theres enough hackers to become disheartened. tldr Insurgency is great how it is. Gamers need to learn to appreciate a game for what it is and stop needing to be rewarded every couple hours for their time. The game itself is the reward not unlocks.,insurgency,cjigjnl,5,t5_2s4cy

2138869,0,t1_clbog6x,the max number of players that can be on a server at any one time is . The way that Source handles bots is by adding them as players This is why sometimes you see John  connected etc after coop roundsIn my experience on Hardcore mode servers this is still a sufficient number of bots for challenging play so dont underestimate what this means for your gameplay. Looking at your settings now I am not sure what might be causing the issue for certain. What I would suggest to normalize your configs is to adjust the servercooperative.cfg settings for mpcoopminmaxbots from  and  to a number that lies within the capacity of the server.with  being max the best blend for difficulty and friends that I have played on is playerspots and then scaling the bots from there.this means setting the lobbysize variable to  iirc its mpcooplobbysize  and then filling the rest up with bots. Max bots with  humans is  and so if you wanted a base number of bots as  then roughly  bots would join everytime another player connected.You can always adjust this too        mpcooplobbysize     mpcoopminbots     mpcoopmaxbots     would yield  players  min and  for each additional player.Also keep in mind that between bot number and difficulty there is also a botdamageratio. bots in your cfg here are going to do damage with  the amount as human players. Tweaking this beyond . can make things a bit too rough since its meant as a mechanism to counter the allknowingallseeingoneshot nature of Computer Players especially with bot difficulty maxed.What to doMake a decision on what you want to have for players within the server restrictions humanBots etc.reduce your mpcoopminmax bots under threshold to the desired amount.change the coop lobbysize to what you want.restart. test. etc.welcome to cfg troubleshootingA few things to note here. If you rented a player server from ViLayer I am not sure what that does to your botcount capacity. It shouldnt make a difference and on the servers I rented it didnt but I am not positive.Lastly I may have mentioned it before but when you load up your server pop up the console and start typing the commands you intended to set and verify that they are actually being taken. If not then you need to assess the .cfg order that the settings are being applied and then adjust them accordingly.It has also been some time since I had a working server  months but things change with active developers so there might be a new .cfg I am unaware of etc.lmk how it goes.ninja edit get both  of bot callouts below your server threshold so the ones in the checkpoint.cfg bring those down to the same  as the other.,insurgency,clbp4fp,1,t5_2s4cy

2406157,0,t3_2mzodt,Put it this way its never any one thing.  Its usually a combination of things although you never really know for sure.  For instance last night playing with some friends.  There was one guy on the other team that would always manage to shoot us at different times from out of the blue.  This went on for a few maps.  We would have a general idea of where he was because we could hear the gun fire and see friendlies die somewhere near us.  The issue was he would peak and shoot at the perfect moment when one of us would look away for a split second. It happens and happening here and there is no big deal.  It just seemed to be a bit too frequent with this guy.  So on a particular map my teammate and this guy would get to a chokepoint at the same time maybe exchange some rounds and both get to cover.  This guy would not peak until the moment my teammate would purposely look away.  He tested him  times and all  times he was miraculously lucky when he chose to peak around the corner to shoot my teammate.  ,insurgency,cm93yv4,3,t5_2s4cy

2622981,0,t3_2pxqzm,Every round i went down to D  of the  rounds ended with me at .    One round i had to go up the stairs from D to B because i was the last man standing. I encountered  enemy on the steps i then walked into B while crouching and then heard footsteps but B wasnt burning. I checked towards A nobody. I then peered around the corner and an enemy starts to peek out from the Platform above CNext to B. I then fire  rounds into him killing him and ending the round with a victory for Security.    In another round where i had my first death the enemy wised up and went behind me. This kills the Machinegunner.  So I adapted from there learning new locations etc. Some of the most hard fought rounds were when i was  having to kill  or  enemies that got into good positions at D.    Then while holding D it starts burning but I noticed something.  A sound like footsteps. So i get up by crouching and then peering behind me low and behold guess who it is?    A Lovely little Insurgent who wanted his secret gift. He didnt know what this gift would be.  Hint It was lead. Lots of Lead. In his chest.    A lot tried going down the stairs from B to D but that proved bad. I first had to suppress them but when i did i had the time to set up my bipod and i think you know how it went from there. Slight peek  Rounds  Dead Insurgents    We only lost  round and i locked the D down everyround. The hardest time is when an enemy Insurgent started shooting at me just from a general location. He Hit me once so i fired into any locations he could have been in. This Suppresses the Insurgent.    Then i wait at he shoots at the cars foam heads missing me by inches. Then The first teammate of the game started to help me. He started firing near the sound which allowed me to quick burst out into the open and kill the insurgent who was proned next to a vehicle.    The best moment i had during this was a similar fight. An enemy behind a Vehicle. I was hit once and i then fired towards the enemy who i could see he proned. This was his fatal mistake.  I could ever so slightly see him behind the car so i fired at the little head i could see and on the th or th shot i killed him.    ampnbsp    All in All i went  had  Objective caps the other  players of my team had a combined . I was MVP every round.    I cant tell you how good this feels Especially in Insurgency.    Because you can try so hard at this game. Sometimes you can be so prepared and still fail.    And every time you fail its painful it causes sadness it causes disappointment.    But No matter how great the setback or how severe the failure you never give up.    You never give up.

2639451,0,t1_cn33rzj,gt forgotten how much you have firedHeres the problem. Dont let yourself forget. Practice practice practice. Go into a practice match against AI and try sniping with an opensights AKM. Unload a magazine into the air in variois fire modes. Try clearing a room by dumping the entire magazine at once. Switch fire modes often and only reload when empty. Its not a hard skill to pick up it just takes a little practice and effort.Also for picking up weapons there is some merit to what toure saying in that instance but even  round magazines is usually plenty for most gametypes. My average shots fired per round in PvP is usually between  rounds or so so right around one magazine. Usually  If I have an AK. For coop you might be shooting more and need to scavenge a rifle but I would say then you should have gone without a sight or a pistol or something to at least get the cheap carrier. I usually use AKs in coop because I prefer the irons on them so I can save those points for something else.,insurgency,cn33x0r,3,t5_2s4cy

Just in case something might happen. I like doing that sort of stuff because its intelligent but all I get for it is  with  caps so I tend to adopt less intelligent play styles that are more exciting and rewarding.Thats why I desperately want to play a game that has no individual player stats. No kills no deaths no assists no objectives nothing. Just whether the team won the round or not.

4068713,0,t3_365uvl,When you want to modify stuff you arent supposed to ever modify the games stock files.  You should do it with your custom folder.Basically you have a insurgencyinsurgencycustom folder and anything that you want to modify make a new folder in there for your mod.  So for you you could create one called WeaponNames.  Inside of WeaponNames you mirror the folder structure of the game so it knows which file you want it to effectively replace.  I dont know where insurgencyenglish.txt file is but if it was in say... insurgencyinsurgencylanguages you would recreate that folder structure inside of the WeaponNames folder and put your new insurgencyenglish.txt file in there.  So it would look like this  insurgencyinsurgencycustomWeaponNameslanguagesinsurgencyenglish.txtThen when you load your game it loads that file instead of the default one.Thats how its done when you make sound mods and stuff so I imagine it should work for almost anything.  Servers running svpure  disable all mods though so the game will load the regular one in that case.  But for Workshopfriendly servers most of them it should work.,insurgency,crk285l,1,t5_2s4cy

Some providers dont offer it and some providers shouldnt offer it. Why wouldnt you want a  tick server always? Because some companies are cheap and their servers cant handle it. So now you get great tick rate but its laggy because the server cant handle it.Id rather have a beast ass server thats  tick than a terrible  tick server.Also CS GO matches are played on  tick servers top tier players refuse to play on  tick rate servers.,insurgency,cs8k9yl,1,t5_2s4cy

4591107,0,t1_ct9aqcj,Youve completely missed the point I was making.The everyday player doesnt give a shit about these kicks. Theyll see a vote kick going on reason player is excessively teamkilling and vote yes. Yes you are correct that if every player was invested in each vote kick it wouldnt be a problem but as I said its totally unreasonable to expect the average player to give two shits about every vote kick. Most would just vote yes on the off chance the accused was guilty.Also calling them shit for not caring about the metagame of a random server they hopped on is strange. Who actually wants to play fauxdetective every time they hop onto a random server? The game would get real boring real fast.And this is why we have admins motivated players like yourself who are responsible enough to make these kinds of decisions.

5061033,0,t3_3k9ivt,I dont feel much of a need for anything but ive been saying for over a year now that there is no real INS equivalent to the MP. MP is basically pistol sized in game has a stupid fast ROF and only really viable for CQB taking close range encounters. People like to compare the AKu but it doesnt stack up honestly not only is it bigger for people who like to corner camp this matters but its viable at pretty much any range. At the end of the day there are weapons that sec have that ins dont really have a match for and likewise the INS have weapons the SEC cant really match. Because of that its really pretty balenced and why I dont particularly care for a new gun despite seeing room for a INS high ROF sub gun.I still think it would be interesting to see like a micro uzi for INS very similar stats in terms of size ROF and caliber to the MPk but it simply isnt necessary.Also inb kciv thesis on why im wrong with graphs.,insurgency,cuw1nnw,3,t5_2s4cy

5359863,0,t3_3oagtl,I Like this so here is what I think is a good approach. Stop that god damn bleeding tourniquetbadagesRunning around with a bloodtsunami out of my arm seems.. dumb... Movementamining restrictions must be applied. Now it is possible to reload with only one hand just saying. You do not recover over time whoever said this up in the comments shoot your self in the foot and start running. See for your self.Because a we cant feel the pain irl it should be enough pain for us to have to limp around the rest of the round.. The phrone animation must be some sort of random falling animation if not we will quicly learn how the enemy fell and if I hit him or not. This is not always easy to see in realety. The jihadi could be dead for all I know so until I have confirmed if he fell because I hit him or because he died I cannot let my eyes of my sector. This is for the servers without killfeedskillmsg.Now this is a realistic approach. Please note that this may fk up the fun of the gameplay . Reload with one arm press magazine eject empty magazine falles out. Lock your gun in your poplitealinside your leg bend sit down. With your trigger hand take out and put in magazine.

5810607,0,t1_cxhcksr,gt However I can assure you not everyone runs APYeah probably not on pubs.  I know pretty much every competitive player will run AP ammo and no armour.  Its pretty useful for wallbanging.  Armour makes you fairly sluggish and while Ins is often slowpaced peaking orientated there are also a tonne of situations where its advantageous to be fast and agile.  If you have good map knowledge for example you can generally carve up on a pub running just an M pistol  suppressor  AP by making it to choke points  outflanking super early due to extra speed.  Id just that say that generally wearing armour doesnt encourage a proper play style and to forget it from the get go.  Even wearing it TTK is still low as hell and due to suppression effect youre generally done for once you take a couple of shots.gt like x  laser  suppressorGod its infuriating when your teammates are running lasers and giving your position away.  Should be removed from game.Also the optics can be super useful.

6698620,0,t1_d05g6kz,CSGOs recoil systemI have  hrs in CSGO I know how it worksCSGO does have a steeper learning curve and a higher skill cap for recoil. I couldnt agree more.Id rather not have to spend  hundreds of hours to master differentand somewhat arbitrary and clunky recoil patterns in a tactical game. It feels like an RPG or something screw your better tactics Ive got more time in gamemore practice controlling a small mechanic so Ive got higher gearslightly better spray control and you lose. CSGOs recoil does not reward tactics. Its  not even a measure of twitch skill as known in other games. It just rewards spending far too much time learning very specialized mechanics which dont even apply to other guns in CSGO much less in other games.CSGO is effectively grinding in an FPS. Insurgency anyone can jump in at roughly the same level on the basic mechanics of the game and if they can figure out tacticsstrategy and have reasonable twitch skills they are on the same level as the veterans.I like Insurgency because the simple gameplay mechanics provide a semirealistic simple way to support more complex tacticstiming and strategy. Guns in Insurgency are easy tactics are hard. They are the means by which you show other people their tactics were wrong   In CSGO both are hard... and the fact that it takes so much time to master the guns before I can reliably implement tactics discourages me.I understand what CSGO is it needs to have an insane skill cap or no skill cap in basically all of its mechanicsshooting nade throws strats AWPing economy etc its just not my kind of game. Id rather not fight long learning curves to get down to a high level of tactical play and Ive never been able to be immersed or satisfied in CSGO.

People have different preferences. With that said all weapons with AP kill in  hits against heavy armor regardless of the value of the weapon. That literally means free weapons are better than the battle rifles. The m kills in  hit has less recoil larger mags quicker scope in time and can be modified with more earlier on than the M. A pistol at close range kills in  hits with AP against heavy just like the M does. At close range a pistol is equally as deadly as a BR. At long range the starting rifle is more deadly than a BR.

He complains about not having options for maps because the current maps that are suggested and considered options such as Embassy kandagal sinjar  have too many flaws. Im pretty sure after all these months there has been enough time for everyone to take a good look at embassy. It including some other uncommon maps have actually been in the ESL map rotation for several months. However it got removed for obvious reasons Im not going to cover every single flaw of a map like embassy for competitive play. Also the map was in the ESL Versus rotation therefore people were sometimes forced to play the map.

And that they have no explosives to clear out entrenched enemies.Yet another variation of this is the calculated marksman who entirely cuts off all hostile avenues of approach only to have their excited calls for their allies to push turn to desperate typing as their requests are drowned out by TakbirSpam which then culminates at the defeat screen after nobody actually contested the point.You see gallant Ramboesque PTFOery can only go so far in a team game comrade.That all said there is cause for hope to the PTFO player Pubbie dynamics work both ways. If a state of balanced gagglefuckery levels exists between the bulk of the teams a driven player can turn the tide. Or waves rather. Of pubbies. ,insurgency,d3lj7gz,7,t5_2s4cy
7741842,0,t3_4lbkkp,You need to take more accurate ping measurements to begin with. You can try  but this isnt necessarily accurate at all times. Open command prompt and manually ping a website such as google.co.uk. Use the results here as a baseline.Next plug your laptop into the router. This will let you compare the two interfaces by pings and will either rule out or highlight wifi problems if present. PS Wifi may look like it is at full signal but can actually have a poor connection quality which can increase pings and general latency.If plugged in the issue remains you need to look at what software you have installed or UPDATED within the last couple of weeks. A consistent uploaddownload on your computer could increase pings program updates windows updates in the background torrents etc but I expect youd have noticed them already.EDIT Windows  downloads updates automatically so this is worth looking at.,insurgency,d3m6w87,1,t5_2s4cy

8912686,0,t3_52bsdx,Let me answer for you.In my experience people who do coop often are more casual players who just want to shoot shit with friends. You probably had a group of friends who vote banned you. In any case its not a big issue since its only one of several servers.In PVP you have a  teamkill limit and people tend not to vote ban for no reason. They might vote kick you if theres the  votes requried to start it. However its rare that it happens if youre not teamkilling mic spamming annoying shit although they rarely kick for this teamflashing on purpose trolling or AFK.In general the community is what youd expect in most games a mix of mature people with many immature people. For example the most often heard catchphrase is allah akhbar along with mic spamming at the end of rounds. At times you have people like ujellymcnelly who offers tons of advice if you want it but it becomes rarer as we find most people dont want advice.TLDR  Those guys were just dicks. Most of us like to think we arent.,insurgency,d7j6aj7,3,t5_2s4cy

Heh I just think its disingenuous to say the game has no regard for realism at all.

10490151,0,t1_dcw995u,Yes although note that the M is also a bit lighter than the AC. Like I mentioned earlier the AC is a good rush weapon as rushing involves running and only shooting when you have a clear target so you dont too large of a magazine size. If youre defending generally its better to shoot if you have even the slightest chance of hitting someone so having  more rounds is a large benefit due to allowing for longer sustained fire. ,insurgency,dcx6377,1,t5_2s4cy

11398954,0,t1_ddxjh6c,Well I wouldnt say they ban anyone better than them necessarily as of course there is a correlation but not necessarily causation between those who are getting high kds on the server and those who are hacking. This is coming from a person who played on lions den for over a year and even befriended the admins and got better at the game as time went on. Recently they banned me for supposed hacking though after all the time i did play on the server and did get good kill death ratios  and also voiced my disdain for hacking while also attempting to defend the server. I never believed that they banned people for simply being better  but i will say is that they definitely arent perfect and rely on circumstantial evidence to ban people. that in itself isnt bad because lots of hacks nowadays  can easily bypass VAC but it becomes a problem when they think that they can never have an error in judgement. That isnt to say they arent right alot of the time either but still. Once they banned a guy who knew how to right click throw a grenade and i couldnt fault them for that because at the time i myself didnt know you could do that so it was easy to brush it off as hacking... until you realize later the dude was in fact never hacking once u test it for yourself...  They unbanned that guy and apologized.  In my case i was banned  for a number of things apparently but one of them was because of my ability to see long distance targets that were concealed or otherwise hard to see particuarly on panj and sinjar... See i spent the time optimizing my graphic settings and my knowledge on how different FOVS can affect your ability to shift zoom on targets at a distance. Its been something i had been doing for a while and  i found out that it does make a big difference. Without that optimization and also looking at the targets carefully they are hard to see normally. I attempted to explain this to them but of course they didnt listen and i had an idea of how they could percieve some of the other things i did as hacking but at the end of the day i didnt record my gameplay nor would they listen to reason so that was the end of that. It is one thing to ban someone because you think they are hacking but another to assert that u know its absolutely true despite missing variables in the analysis. This is why i record my gameplay now and also wish  someday all first person shooters should be played in person at reputable locations like CS GO tournaments are. This protects everyone from cheaters and also misplaced cheating accusations since everyone can see your screen and computer in person.  so yeah if you were banned and know for a fact u didnt use any cheating software that is all that matters and just move on to playing on other servers.,insurgency,dfo21zv,1,t5_2s4cy
