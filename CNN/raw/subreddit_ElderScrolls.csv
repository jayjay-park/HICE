864083,0,t3_23o02z,I really do feel that Joe looked at ESO from a Skyrimplayers perspective and I think that did a lot to colour his opinion of the game. Personally I enjoyed Skyrim but for me it didnt always feel terribly like Morrowind and even Oblivion when it came to the lore that it presented Bethesda retconned or adapted a large amount of lore to be able to incorporate dragonsdragon shouts so heavily into the narrative. So far ESO has been for me a bit of a return to the feeling of the series preSkyrim especially when it comes to its treatmentportrayal of Mer and Beast races something that may be related to the jump backwards in time. The gameplay may not be groundbreaking but its certainly serviceable and it does bring some new and worthwhile innovations to both the genre and the series. For me what Ive always been most drawn to about the TES series has been the universe why else is Morrowind a game riddled with bugs so compelling even a decade on?I dunno Im not saying ESO is worth the subscription. But I do strongly disagree with Joe about it being worthy of the licence bugs for example are nothing new for an MMO release and certainly nothing new for a TES game.,ElderScrolls,ch2i2gd,2,t5_2s2ja
875755,0,t3_245i69,For questing the best tip is to read. The reason a lot of people like Morrowind is because of the depth it presents and the lack of hand holding. The journal is helpful as reminders of what you need to do but you cant get away with not reading with the characters say. Asking NPCs about directions to places if really important if you dont want to rely on the wikis for locations. You cant just rely on the journal entries and hope theyll get you where you need to go as theres no magic compass arrow. You can click on blue words in the journal entries for reminderssummaries of what NPCs said about the topic.For combat just keep playing. People only think the combat is clumsy because they dont understand it. A lot of people come in expecting hack and slash adventure combat but Morrowinds combat is a bit more old school RPGish and relies on dice rolls. When you hit a character with your weapon all youve really done is take a swing at them. If you actually hit them or not and how much damage you do is determined by your weapon skills and agilitystrength. The better your stats are the more often you hit things.,ElderScrolls,ch3tsht,7,t5_2s2ja

989269,0,t1_chgfs3n,It depends on what you mean by dumbing down.  Certainly one can take that approach that dont read text anymore follow marker and some people do really do that but there were much greater problems in earlier stages of Elder Scrolls especially before Oblivion.  Now when I say problems I say that all of the games have them and that beside all of that they are all truly amazing games.This rebuttal video of the Elder Scrolls getting dumbed down I think brings up some very good points.

1343500,0,t1_cikqf6x,A war fought outside of Dominion lands wont end the Dominion expel it certainly but theyve already been expelled from Hammerfell. High Rock was never truly invaded by the Dominion as far as we know and thus their powers and presence in High Rock would be more faint than that of Skyrim. No I spoke of overthrowing them or rather toppling their control over one of their current provinces. Its really not hard to see that the Dominion are the most pressing story that effects all of Tamriel at this time  dismissing them is both nonsensical from a lore standpoint but a slap in the face to the fans considering how the Thalmor were built up in Skyrim. As for the absurd fanfiction? That was in regards to their motives as the only theory weve been given as of yet is something too absurd to pass the laugh test out of Michael Kirkbride  a man people often forget who is no longer a Bethesda employ and whose works are noncanon unless Bethesda goes Yes this is the case. You mean the selfabsorbed side the extreme scholasticism the advanced magical focus of their society and a huge number of goingson outside of that. That said while I definitely prefer Summerset as the setting for a number of reasons Ive outlined here and on rnextelderscrolls I have little qualms with Elsweyr or Valenwood I simply hold that within the Dominion is without a doubt the most likely and sensible locale for the next game.,ElderScrolls,cikrc9r,1,t5_2s2ja

But hope alone isnt going to keep me from discussing other very realistic  possibilities. You said it yourself BGS was working on their next project during TESV. Its gonna be at least  years still. So even if they are working on TESVI during this project it still could based on recent history be  years after their next release before we see TESVI. What would that be ?I am hoping that they are going to use pretty much the same engine in both games this could dramatically reduce the time till TESVI. Maybe we could see it and Im being super optimistic in .,ElderScrolls,cowwq7w,-1,t5_2s2ja
3305383,0,t1_coyitk7,Though I wish it were true that is not a possibility as the world in which Tamriel is locaded is not actually the world of an Aedra God but actually of a Daedra so no space travelling in TES just yet but I guess they could at some point who knows. But another possibility would be to visit the other continents or just adding other continets as DLCs would be a great addition to the game.,ElderScrolls,cp51g5t,2,t5_2s2ja
3306898,0,t1_cp55n4v,well the Thalmor are really really prideful elves and elves are more directly descended from the Divines than men are. The Divines created Mundus and once were beings with a presence in Mundus and created or begat Im not sure the Elhnofey and from the Elhnofey were descended the races of elves and the races of men and the beast races but theres some mystery about how the Argonians fit in because theyre descended from sentient trees and those may or may not be related to the Elhnofey. I dont actually know what the Elhnofey are and I think Im misspelling that.Certain High Elves the Thalmor claim the purest bloodline from the Divines. They view the races of men as bad. They view the creation of Mundus their plane of existence and of men as bad. Thus they dont like Talos because he was a man once before becoming a Divine so theyre not descending from him.Essentially the Thalmor want to destroy creation because they think it was a mistake and it doesnt do the Divines justice or something.

4240000,0,t3_39hv91,Id like to see more quests and sidequests have impacts on each other and the world even if in small ways. A few ways Skyrim did this was guards making new comments about your past achievements changing that tree in White Run and changing who controlled forts and cities in the civil war. However I think there should be more lasting consequences that show up over time instead of just after the main quest. As is the quest system feels more like a modular rinserepeat without your choices mattering much once you get quest completed.Ive also noticed in Witcher  that secondary quests branch off the main quest storyline where you can rush off after the main quest or followup on loose ends that arose in one of its stages. Something like this happened in Skyrim where if you got your elf contact safely out of the Thalmor embassy you would find him later in Winterhold needing help getting out of the province. I would love to see way more of that. Thats really good stuff when it comes to questing and makes a huge difference.,ElderScrolls,cs3jvlj,15,t5_2s2ja

6577679,0,t3_45rk0k,The landscapes in Skyrim when compared to those in Oblivion and Morrowind are fairly boring and lack variety.Thats probably why there are more indoor quests in Skyrim to keep the overall play experience from becoming too visually repetitive.They also clearly had a lot more man hours to throw at interior area design with Skyrim and could craft much more interesting interiors for quest use so they tended to make use of them.Even the towns in Skyrim are quite similar to one another I get why they tried to let them be their own thing and do more quests indoors.Note that from a lore perspective the way Skyrim looks makes total sense. It probably shouldnt be made much more visually diverse.I agree that I missed the larger number of out in the open quests that Oblivion and Morrowind had but I understand why the designers went that way. It will be interesting to see how this trend progresses and what kind of balance is struck with the next release.,ElderScrolls,czzop8y,29,t5_2s2ja

Especially with things like Sims  where you could pick from a list of personality characteristics for each Sim and the personality choices would impact the ways your Sim could interact with other characters insane sims could scream to themselves mean Sims could randomly insult people etc.  Bethesda RPGs could learn a thing or two about ways to expand roleplaying ingame based on stuff like Sims.,ElderScrolls,d09lyry,3,t5_2s2ja

7400730,0,t3_4gofap,Im gonna disagree with everyone here. While I played morrowind for more hours than I like to admit back in the day its hard to go back and play it now. The game is unpolished. There is no fast travel you will be doing a LOT of walking. The combat can be pretty rough. You will get frustrated at some things and you will have to work around them and deal with it strength drain comes to mind. Managing a high number of quests is not easy  you have a single journal. If you want to go back to a quest you stopped midway several quests ago its going to take some digging or the use of one of the many wikis. There are a ton of bugs definitely get a bug fix mod. If you have a large montior gtp youll probably end up using a lower resolution due to UI scaling issues.Even with all that and more Im sure I missed it is definitely one of the best RPGs of all time. If you think you can push through the issues with it then by all means please give it a try. You will be glad you you pushed through it once you get into it.

It turns out hed toggled crouch and was sneaking the entire time he was hunting the deer which also explained why they were going down in one shot.It was incredibly funny once we realized what happened and although he never played the game again I started my own character and Ive played through Oblivion at least twice a year every year since.,ElderScrolls,d2n00uj,2,t5_2s2ja

7495853,0,t1_d2u6ob0,Let me establish Im not questioning your knowledge of the game. Im simply saying that I feel that you dont have to efficiently level to enjoy yourself which is what I feel you are saying.Ive played through it five or six times though it was a while ago and I cant exactly remember what level I usually got to though I believe I was usually between  and  before I wrapped up my play throughs. I would go through all of the questlines and end up having a magic heavy character usually conjuration blade a mix of heavy and light armor and destruction and marksman for range. Yes the enemies became sponges late game but that was never something that inhibited my enjoyment of the game. I never took the difficulty down from default because I felt that the tough enemies that you faced would hit hard and so you would have to adapt to them change your strategy. and on a side not I always found it hilarious to be followed around my a pincushion full of pretty amber arrows hahaI dont think youre a dick because you have a indepth knowledge of the game I spend a helluva lot of time on rteslore just reading about the universe this series is set in. I just feel that telling people if you dont efficiently level you wont enjoy the game at high levels is just a little bit pretentious because of the subtext of you dont know how to enjoy this game I do though.I love Oblivion it was my first TES game and I want people to try it out to see if they like it and if they want to do efficient leveling than that is a valid option. And I appreciate people like you who make these guides for people who want to do it because I know its just something that you want to do. However I just feel like telling people they must do something to get the most enjoyment out of the game is the wrong way to go about it. I never efficiently leveled as far as I know and I loved it. It was a great deal of fun for me all the way through to the end of my accounts where I stopped because I felt like I wanted to end the account having done all of the quests I wanted to.But these are just my opinions. I recognize that people are going to play RPGs like Oblivion whatever way they want to and thats part of what I love about the games.

To get to Bleakrock once you wake up in that houseroom right after the tutorial go outside and head to the right. There should be a Nord standing off by a fountain if I remember right its been a while so I could be wrong and he will give you a quest that takes you down to the docks to jump on a boat and take you over to Bleakrock Isle.

If you notice the other alliances they are lead by the most civilized race Redguards are an exception. I think for the way they portrayed the Altmer Auridon is perfect. If they make an Elder Scrolls game in Summer Set it may be different. Also remember ESO is very downsized runs off with slightly different lore and its not an Elder Scrolls game. ITS NOT. They had to take shortcuts and cut out a few things. Yes it sucks the Altmer arent portrayed the way you want. They still look alien. If they made every Alliance proper size and made everything perfect. Well the whole multiplayer aspect will be gone because the map will be so huge already and be hard to run.

It has a massive bridge facing the sea from a high vantage point and to assault from the land you have to fight an uphill battle against a castle. Based on skyrim it could seem like Solitude is an easy city to sack but they failed to acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult to get to the doors alone. Along with this there was no battering ram or anything required to get through the doors blocked by bars of steel.

8201870,0,t1_d529ulx,The skill in Skyrim is not fun yet is the most overpowered skill by far. That is really bad design especially considering how items like dragonbone armor and daedric armor are nearly impossible to get without this one single skill which is incredibly boring to grind. Daedric armor can also be gotten if you have a good enough conjuration but without either Conjuration or Smithing the only way to get either of those in the base game is by completely random placements. Which I during my hundreds of hours of gameplay only managed to find  set of gauntlets.Then once youve gotten daedric armor and enhanced it you dont need to find any other armor or weapons in the game. The fact that you must grind some shitty skill to get THE BEST ITEMS in the game is just lame as hell. gtI dont see why the character shouldnt be able to become a blacksmith of godlike abilitySure you should be able to but you just aswell should be able to get equally great gear just by adventuring you know actually doing something that deserves a great reward instead of spamming iron daggers all day. ,ElderScrolls,d52sd1r,2,t5_2s2ja

Unless youre wanting an astronomical number of NPCs dialogue options and specialized replies for every option theres no reason that they cant just go ahead and voice the NPCs.The thing about text to speech in the way that youre talking about it is that all ready its not very realistic in one tone. If an NPC is angry or sad how are you gonna get that tone without prerecording the line in that tone? Its just not a very realistic expectation for a video game. Theyll probably just stick to the normal voicing.In my opinion when Todd meant about the technology was that theyre currently still developing an engine strong enough to run a game of the expanse at which they are looking. This could potentially hint to in my opinion a huge worldmaybe multiple provincesor bug huge cities and plenty of NPCs or maybe plenty of NPCs and the most realistic AI they will ever make.

8340183,0,t3_4tlvh6,Problem is its not small changes and they are one time missteps. Its a trend that they have been dumbing down each game and removing RPG elements. gt The reviewer said that your character having a backstory as a war veteran is horrible. Seriously? It doesnt affect the gameplay of the game in anyway. You can still build your character however you like.I think this criticism is more a matter of principle. The big thing about Bethesda games is that they are historically completely open world and your character can be whoever you want. Oblivion does this the best because youre not even wrapped up in a prophecy  your guy is in jail for whatever reason hes a murderer he was framed etc...its all up to you. We all love Bethesda and we are critical because we know they could make the best RPG of all time in the eyes of their biggest fans if they wanted to. Bring back the complexities of daggerfallmorrowind and mix it with the sleeker gameplay combat and magic systems of oblivion and skyrim. Make the guild quests actually mean something they need to bring back the minimum skill requirements or it all feels shallow. I think we would all be fine with a smaller amount of sidequests and dungeons if they were more fleshed outunique instead of draugr tomb . You get the point I have a lot of feelings about this. Its just so simple! Why cant they do it?I also wanna note that I dont think its as much of an argument about them selling out its really about the overall quality of the game. If Bethesda was only about money they would have pumped out Skyrim sequels every other year for the rest of the decade. Instead its  and we have no Elder Scrolls VI in sight.

If Bethesda used a third party engine like CryEngine Unreal or Unity or even IdTechs more recent stuff theyd still have to find a way to add all of the aformentioned features into the engine to satisfy fans and find a way of doing it that wouldnt end up being a tradeoff from the advantages of starting from scratch. Putting all that aside theyd still have to retrain developers and remake the dev tools theyve been using since Morrowind which adds a whole other level of risk and all this while theyre also expanding their studio and working on new IPs.,ElderScrolls,d6hh5ky,24,t5_2s2ja

Id like to see TESVI as soon as possible too but its hard to blame them for wanting to branch out and try new stuff.At least theyre publicly acknowledging that the game is a work in progress and its actually coming.

9277267,0,t1_d8rjymt,The best part about skyrim is that you distinguish your character and your playstyle at even the start of the game by your actions and choices with your character. One way of distinguishing your character at the start of the game is by equipment but TES games generally have the different types of weapons and armor laid out for you at the very beginning. I think the only solution that TES games do not already provide is having different character origin stories like in the first Dragon Age. ,ElderScrolls,d8ryknp,1,t5_2s2ja

9478174,0,t3_5ajk7h,This gets tougher each playthrough as I learn more and more. I admit I am pretty new to the deeper lore so hopefully my thoughts arent too off! Lately I have wondered really who are more correct in the big picture  I usually go Stormcloak because freedom and all. But then I read up on Ulfric and what sort he is and now I am trying to think longer term if keeping the empire together is best to avoid a wipe by the elves or if open defiance of the White Gold Concordat in Skyrim will inspire the Imperials to step in time or if it matters if the Imperials join the fight at all. The failed Red Guard attacks and its costly price  how the Elves are just as reeling from the Great War as the Empire makes me wonder Are they in any position to invade? The elves would surely call upon Cyrodiil to aid in their invasion would the Imperials really make the decision to march against the nords? They dont mind killing Nords in the civil war so quite possible they open their borders and join the attack. Would negotiating a truce with the Season Unending quest support the Empire  or just delay the inevitable? Holds are traded hands but the open fighting stops  which I feel most directly opposes the Thalmor since they make it clear the longer and bloodier this war is the better it is for them to sweep up the pieces. But does that simply delay the inevitable and give the Thalmor time to plan and rebuild for another war? Ramble ramble ramble. TLDR Stormcloaks again for me even though I wish their leader wasnt Ulfric. ,ElderScrolls,d9he0pk,3,t5_2s2ja

9693159,0,t3_5db4jd,Man I cant pick just one. I love each of them for different reasons.

I remember playing it for the first time and just being amazed by what was possible in the world of video games. My relationship with the dark brotherhood also began with this game. I love Skyrim because it makes you feel like a fucking badass. That doesnt sound like much of a reason but sometimes its nice to be able to just put on some awesome looking armor and throw down all over the place. Also I like to play in rd person most of the time and the rd person perspective was definitely the best its been in this game. Edit The more I think about it the more Im leaning toward Skyrim. Its easily the most accessible of the three but I dont really think thats a bad thing. This game is just a damn good time. ,ElderScrolls,da7vyrn,1,t5_2s2ja

Simply having to walk to a nearby travel post hire a boat or silt strider adds so much weight to traveling.  I dont want it to be a pain to get around but concerning immersion it goes a long way to have to consult a map for travel planning once in a while.  Make the player strategize for the best route pay a hefty sum at the silt strider for convenience or make the way there on foot.And the whole dont like it dont use it angle kinda misses the point IMO.

The month they are born in can affect them in both a cultural way and also in a physical one. Their plastic physiology as a race and their relationship to the rest of the world make them pretty original in my opinion. ,ElderScrolls,ddv8zdt,1,t5_2s2ja

10972660,0,t3_5s1rst,Brilliant idea for the next game. Increase the armor slots and types!insert heckler here no shit sherlock. We all want that but the inventory management will be terrible!Ah but thats what makes my idea brilliant. Custom armor sets. You can assign different armor pieces to your armor sets so they are all kept under one nice slot in your inventory. You can select the slot to view the pieces or you can just put on a different piece that will replace the one you currently have on. Hovering over the armor set will tell you total armor weight Heavy ltgt Light it should be a spectrum! and other general details.This lets us have plenty of armor pieces and not as much inventory management as equipped items get a submenu and then you can also assign other sets to their own submenu heres my mage set and my sneaky set etc.You could even have options for just storage submenus togglable to be all the jewelry and different armor slots or maybe armor types. itd be easy enough to sort if from there.,ElderScrolls,debr3tx,11,t5_2s2ja

11330485,0,t3_61njx8,I went from Oblivion some Morrowind then Skyrim then Morrowind then Daggerfall. I adore each game. Morrowind is very special because the focus on the lore. I had a lot of fun running around and learning about the Dark Elves and their living gods. In Morrowind you are nothing an outlander that isnt wanted. You have to fight and earn your way to the top. Lots of running around trying to find the damn dungeons and where people want you to go. A complex fast travel system to go along with it. Then by the end almost everyone recognizes you as the grand hero. Fantastic. All in a strange alien world too.I have to admit there was some disapointment based on how everyone hypes the game up as the best in the series. Like there was the time an Argonian was being hassled by a few racist Elves. I spoke to these elves and they did not even comment on the fact that I was an Argonian as well.

I actually dabbled with Morrowind on the Xbox before Skyrim. It wasnt until Summer  when I had a lot of free time after College classes that I jumped in to Morrowind. Fantastic game. I did mod it up to make it a bit faster regenerating stamina. But I have now played it without with only bug fixes and graphic changes. Fantastic game and world I can get lost in.
