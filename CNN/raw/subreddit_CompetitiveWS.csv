For the refresh simply getting more games will be more useful to see if it happens. For marika being effective with  of them I think it would be useful to see how much damage sticks from marikas in each game. And winning is obvious getting more games would be better. I agree with shinkiii though. It would be better to have a bunch of decks that are grouped together based on their type. That would expand the the number of decks that you can test against as well as expand your data sets for each deck type. ,CompetitiveWS,d1jd2ob,1,t5_3brxf
