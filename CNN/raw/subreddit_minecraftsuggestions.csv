626381,0,t3_21bgk2,So a proposal to make Creeper food to being TNT?  I think gunpowder food would also do though only add to its power in smaller amounts as opposed to using TNT food.Interesting idea though the execution will make for inconsistent gameplay as all other forms of feeding currently require the food item to being active in your hotbar and then rightclicking on the desired entity to feed.  Given current properties of creepers this is obviously a risky task.  Proposing the creeper entity to pick up the dropped TNT entity would require some specialized coding similar to the villagers breadpotato tossingpickup code currently in . snapshot development  not something a coder likes to see suggested.On the other hand proposing this as part of a feature to allow ALL Mobs to be fed by appropriate dropped entities like certain foods would be more practical and featureenriching and something that Ive been wanting to see for a LONG TIME already can see this in action in limited ways with Mo creatures mod in vanilla play.

The reason youd want to find one of these Villager Cities in the first place is because of all the possible tradesitems to receive from it.Just a thought I had.

So youd just label each possible orientation  and the block would rotate to the next available rotation. Since relatively few well zero blocks have  unique faces most of them would only have a few rotations to go through.Halfblocks have  top or bottom of blockspace.

3229510,0,t1_cow2u6a,Every block with variants uses block states. The thing is resource packs change the appearance of existing ones. Cauldrons only have four different water levels. Sure you can change the model and how much water visually resides inside the pot but its still the same four different states.Adding block states that dont exist basically means creating an entirely new block which causes problems because every player on a server can use a different combination of resource packs. If you had a pack with costum blocks and placed them in the world everyone else on the server would see a block that doesnt even exist in their game. There would have to be a fallback system so that any illegal blockstate encountered would be replaced by some kind of placeholder block. In the worst case youd have a world littered with these every time you play multiplayer or change resource packs.,minecraftsuggestions,cowqsb9,1,t5_2s3oo

3623250,0,t3_31v7i7,As a pvper I have a few suggestions.. Please add block hitting back. It added many cool things in PvP and once it was removed many PvP strats died.. Faster clicking many people are starting to jitter click and it would be cool if the swing per second is higher so people jitter clicking can have an advantage over those who just click.. Add some more side weapons like the fishing rod and FnS. More weapons like that can add some pretty cool stuff to combat. Like a grappling hook.. Something to avoid is OP enchantments. Fast Drawback is too OP. Something balanced would be a double arrow shotRandomized thoughThats all that I can think of. Just hopefully dont mess up XD,minecraftsuggestions,cq59zog,1,t5_2s3oo

3624132,0,t3_31v7i7,Aside from my other post about armor mechanicsprotection tooltip I like a lot about the current system. It is hard to say exactly what it is but things like going in to attack and then running to heal maintaining your hunger and stuff like that which give it a unique feel. My favorite type of combat are survival battles against bosses and such usually with mods since vanilla bosses arent very challenging at the moment anyway... although the guardians are pretty challenging.One thing I do hate is how overpowered Strength Potions are. They are fairly cheap to make and give a ridiculous  damage I believe which can hit absurdly hard with even an unenchanted iron sword. While they may not be too powerful in PvP due to the strong armor they make most mobs and bosses a joke. I would love to see their damage scaled back  for Strength  and  for Strength ? even if pvp aspects protection enchant are tweaked to compensate.Another thing Id like to see improve is the Swords Block for the most part it is rather useless. I remember one mod added an ability that made swords block reduce the knockback you took which with the halved damage made it a lot more useful without being overpowered.Also Ive seen a few others mention this but more weapon choices would be nice. For example a longer range melee weapon like a halberd or spear that can hit foes from further away but deals less damage than swords. Instead of a block it could get a unique right click ability perhaps some form of sweep that can hit foes to the sides of your target.The last thing I can think to mention are status effects. There is currently a nice set of effects but most have limited use. Mobs have access to a small pool mainly just poison wither and mining fatigue. Players can use fire though enchantments and flint and steellava although it technically isnt a status effect. Potions allow more effects like Poison Weakness and Slowness and the only way to cure them is with milk. It would be nice to see more ways for both players through enchants and potions and mobs to access these effects like Blindness Hunger Haste Saturation and Mining Fatigue.Also it would be cool to have looting on bows...,minecraftsuggestions,cq5dm28,1,t5_2s3oo

3633663,0,t3_31v7i7,Heya Dinnerbone I am not one to say too much about PvP since I do not frequently fight other players but when I have Ive came up with several suggestions.   Skill Trees   As introduced with plugins such as mcMMO. The addition of skill trees adds a much more fun element of PvP. The more you practice the better you get. This also prevents a new comer on the server from being able to rank up very quickly by killing a lot of better players without doing any work on their own.   Better Critical Hits   As of right now the only way to get a critical hit is by jumping and hitting your enemy as you fall. In Mineshafts one can easily jump into spider webs and as they slowly fall they can get critical hits every time.   Duck and Rolls   From what I know the only way to dodge a hit is to deflect it with your sword. It would be nice to be able to dodge it other ways. Also when doing a large jump off of a high place it would be nice to be able to roll so you dont take as much damage.    Hits   Depending on where you hit a player it should effect them more or less depending on where it is. Also possible or would be cool is the edges of the screen got red as your health got lower and when you drown it goes a dark blue. ,minecraftsuggestions,cq6gr44,1,t5_2s3oo

3691804,0,t1_cqclo5q,Think about what youre saying for a moment. Youre citing a piece of gear as a reason that PvP isnt entirely gearbased.And for a matter of fact I actually am fairly good at PvP I win most equallymatched battles and several where Ive been at a disadvantage and from my experience it really is almost entirely gearbased. If you have better gear you breeze through the fight regardless of how much effort you or the opponent put into the fight like the guy you fought that couldnt use a mouse. If you have worse gear you either die or are forced to run away regardless of how much gear you have.Skill only matters in as you say equal fights but Minecrafts combat system seems to be designed if you can even call it that from the ground up to mitigate skill as much as possible. Missing doesnt matter when you can attack as fast as your mouse can click and hitting is the matter of taking a split second to look at your enemy while clicking really quickly. Dodging doesnt matter for the same reason and being evasive and strafey by staying out of your enemys range means you cant hit them either and the moment you get in range to attack them means they can attack you too. Since theres next to no variation in combat alternate playstyles exist in small amounts but are inviable compared to outgearing and theres little skill in combat to begin with virtually all success in combat comes from having better gear than the other player including potions including Strength II and from having less lag than the other player.Strength II may have made that fight skillbased and bearable but thats more because of how OP Protection IV is. Quite honestly when you have the equivalent of  health and are regenerating the equivalent of  health per four seconds all fights will be boring. Strength II with Sharp V swords are the only thing that can really get past this immense defense and would be sickeningly OP for any other purpose just like Protection IV. That doesnt change the fact that PvP has little skill in it it just means that when you completely equalize players the only actual variable left is skill hence when you fought said equallyequipped player you came out on top with Strength and drew it to a stalemate without it simple explanation in reality as well as most video games including Minecraft the victor comes down more to who gets the first few hits in since with Strength an individual hit makes much more of a difference this gave you victory in the strength battle but when those hits became far less meaningful without Strength it became a stalemate instead plus the foe had more time to catch up. Im not saying this is what happened but its a possible explanation.Im going to say it again youre citing a piece of gear as evidence that the system isnt gear based. Obviously both can both players have Strength II. If the dunderhead you mention in the OP had Strength II youd have died pretty easily unless he also had absolutely no awareness and didnt notice you stabbing him for five or so seconds after which he would have died... or some equallyunlikely scenario. The fact that he didnt have Strength II is the entire point Im making you won because of your gear more than your skill.,minecraftsuggestions,cqd38ll,0,t5_2s3oo

3734828,0,t1_cqhzi03,Swing speed is infinitely fast and swings occur the moment the game registers a click the only thing preventing you from decimating playersmobs with autoclickers or fast hands is the  millisecond mercy invincibility. This is very easy to see when fighting a group of mods just wiggle your mouse over all of them and click really quickly and youll notice that youve hitting all of them way faster than you can hit just one. The swinging animation is fluff and has nothing to do with attack speed this includes Mining Fatigue and Haste which visually make you swing slowerfaster but dont actually change your swing speed. Your swing actually connects right as the animation starts this has the effect of having the swing visually hit the opponent a quarter of a second after it actually hit.Most mods that Ive seen dont change the swing speed but rather increase or decrease the mercy invincibility this actually makes Tinkers Constructs cleavers hilariously easy to abuse their only drawback is that the  millisecond mercy invincibility is extended to ms or a full second instead of a half second since cleavers receive doubled damage boosts from Sharpness modifiers you can easily boost a cleavers damage enough to oneshot every mob in the game thereby completely ignoring the downside since a dead mob obviously doesnt receive mercy invincibility similarly also in Tinkers Construct rapiers actually have boosted attack speed not from actually attacking quicker but from shortening the mercy invincibility to almost nothing. In this way pushing multiple enemies at once would already pretty much be a mechanic of the shield if you just increase the mercy invincibility that shield hits inflict albeit in a clunky fashion. Being swarmed by mobs usually doesnt mean anything bad since fast enough fingers with the current sword knockback is enough to keep them all at bay until they die or at least break a hole in the swarm for you to run through either way a niche situation.,minecraftsuggestions,cqhzty4,1,t5_2s3oo

3827886,0,t3_31v7i7,You should add armors with different materials like stone emerald etc.. Also add shieds we could combine shield and sword to make a set. In addition why not adding combat enchants like electrism stunning slowing and poisoning? It would be awesome! Furthermore Double Axes would be awesome in fighting bosses and viking updates with chests filled with weapons would be a good idea too! Daggers would be an awesome weapon against villagers as they would drop emeralds! Nevertheless Minecraft has only got villagers as traders. Why not adding a time machine that leads you to ddle Ages? People there should have Weapons Trades. Middle Ages would be the perfect place to add new bosses and mobskillers. Also enemy bleeding! Finally Ender Dragon armorweapon drops would be amazing!

3850982,0,t3_31v7i7,new weapons are grate and all but i think that there should be new animations and different types of attacks that affect your opponent in ways specific to the attack for instance a stab may result in a over time health drain on players or non undead mobs. i also think that there should be an introduction of a new stealth system in game crouching doesnt really do much i think that it should eliminate your nameplate all together and maybe effect the lethality of some attacks one last thing bowsthere should be different types of bows and arrows and they should behave differentlya bow made of oak should be an oak bow and maybe have better damage than a pine bow but have less durability or some other flaw to make it balancedarrows should like in real life have a chance to pass through your opponent and stick in the ground or maybe a mob behind them just some ideas i think would be cool                                        ,minecraftsuggestions,cqv8wov,1,t5_2s3oo

4293006,0,t1_cs9ghnm,Fixing the games difficulty issues should not be a task left to the player. Its a problem with the core game and if the players who find the game too easy just install mods or use selfimposed challenges or whatever then the problems with difficulty will never be fixed. You cant just ignore a problem with the game like that and its sickening how significant a portion of the community thinks its acceptable.And while the game isnt aimed at hardcore players that still doesnt mean you should exclude them. Many people commend Minecrafts ability to provide something for everyone but it fails spectacularly at actually producing a meaningful survival experience its just too damn easy once you stop being a potato. Turning the current Easy into Hard isnt the way to go I agree if only because Hard is annoying for builders and newbies but thats no reason to not make Normal and Hard harder or add higher difficulties.,minecraftsuggestions,cs9jksr,1,t5_2s3oo

The more milkusers there are the less point there is in bringing potions of any sort which means there is more incentive to use milk potions.Ergo it will eventually result in everyone using only splash milk potions reducing variety in an alreadysamey combat system.

4949501,0,t3_3ildfa,Ive been thinking about this with regards to the . combat update. With some of the directional stuff the Mojangsters are doing getting behind an enemy could be an advantage in combat which could be problematic if you can run through enemies. If doing more damage by being behind an enemy is a thing I think it would be best if you have to run around the enemy not through them.  Not getting pushed off cliffs by your dog which used to happen is good and not getting pushed around by other players on large public servers is often good at least if its not a pvp server but I think for pvp in . player collision checking in some form would be good to add on top of the changes theyve already been making.,minecraftsuggestions,cuifaio,1,t5_2s3oo

My original post includes optional minmax values which I think could be helpful. Also the thing you demonstrated with chain command blocks isnt a bug. There currently is a way around it though it involves testforblock inverters and doubles the amount of commands you need. I also proposed a coordinate system for conditional command blocks which would completely fix your problem but I still think this command would be very useful. ,minecraftsuggestions,cuimmzp,2,t5_2s3oo

4959128,0,t1_cujgrcr,It also doesnt make much sense that you can currently ingame for example invert Water Breathing or Poison into Harming. I would love to hear new potion effect ideas however as I mentioned in the post I feel that making Weakness be the inverse of the Strength potion causes a huge increase in difficulty in curing Villagers as the player now has to go to the Nether first to obtain blaze powder for the Strength recipe. I know it isnt the best fit but IMO it fits way better than Water Breathing inversed to Harming. Otherwise another suggestion would be to have a Potion of Defense which you can inverse for a new sort of defense weakness potion then change the requirement of curing Villagers to the new defense weakness potion instead of a Potion of Weakness and change the Weakness recipe to be brewed from Strength potions. Another ANOTHER suggestion would be to allow both potions of Defense and Strength to invert into Weakness in the same vein that both Leaping and Swiftness when inverted produce Slowness,minecraftsuggestions,cujmymr,1,t5_2s3oo

Also still has the advantage of being way easier to obtain then soap and according to dinnerbone will probably also have the advantage of filling the hunger bar in the near future.Ice blocks are endgame for a reason if they were supposed to be obtainable early on we would be able to get them early on. Also its like packed ice which is rare for a reason its to op in early game. I wont deny that this block could be handy but your mineshaft sprint jump idea is kinda silly it would take way longer to place all those blocks then it would to just walk down your mine shaft and if your mine is so long that you need something like this you should probably make a new mine shaft or make a short cut to where you want to go.Goldiron ore are not just as useless because you can actually do something with them on their own with fat you cant do anything with it on its own.  ,minecraftsuggestions,cvk1rpg,1,t5_2s3oo

5811989,0,t1_cxhifq9,Id agree that not every mob needs to have a special ability but only if a good percentage of mobs did. Further complicating things they spawn in an area where about half of the mobs are generic and are trash because of it.Endermen are pretty unique due to their teleportation and slightly higher range I dont think theyre a very good example. A better one might be wither skeletons but theyre at least justified because there are no other hostile Nether mobs. These dont really have that excuse as in crystalline caves and strongholds if either of those variants are added zombies slimes and spiders are already meleerange and spawn in the same location and dont even have an equivalent to the mildlyinteresting witherinflicting effect.The only ability they have is not drowning but most mobs automatically swim so its not a concern for them. These dont but they sink which can make them pretty bad at pursuing a player in water as they cant reach whereas other mobs would albeit slowly and skeletons wouldnt even have a problem as they benefit from water.Its more durable than most mobs but that means very little when its a meleerange mob. Players can consistently keep them out of range while taking no damage themselves so its not like the health does anything for them.If youre going to keep the different attack speed I would at least give them a range larger than the players so they have to be goaded into attacking. That and armorshield piercing hitting multiple enemies is fairly pointless especially in singleplayer given how infrequently two players will be right behind eachother in melee combat AND how short melee range is for mobs. This keeps them fairly generic while being nottrash if that tickles your pickle.,minecraftsuggestions,cxhj60s,2,t5_2s3oo

6258277,0,t1_cz0ujku,The axe and sword so long as they are of the same material type and you are not counting certain enchantments have the same overall worth in combat.The sword has the sweep attack dealing a heart of damage to mobs that are in very close proximity to the mob you hit it also attacks slightly faster than the axe by . attacks per second it can do extra knockback through enchantment or sweep attack and can set your opponents on fire.The axe can disable shields and they do more base damage than the sword which also yields more damage from criticals than swords.The advantage of greater damage is that it reduces the effectiveness of armor per heart of damage but does not reduce past  damage reduction  armor bars.Criticals increase damage dealt from base attacks and from the strength buff but not enchantments so the highest damage possible from a sharpness  diamond swords critical while under the strength  buff is . damage . damage with fire aspect and the highest damage possible from a sharpness  diamond axes critical while under the strength  buff is . damage.I do believe that is a  damage difference so the only advantage a sword is the extra damage from fire which clearly makes up for the difference but not in armor reduction attack speed if fire is included and armor reduction is not and extra knockback through enchantment and specials best for against groups.However that advantage is why I stated that the sword is better for taking on endermen especially in groups.,minecraftsuggestions,cz0zx4p,1,t5_2s3oo

6346553,0,t3_42j4v6,Enderbound would be very annoying for PvP due to the scarcity of end cities or rather the finite nature of its loot making getting a full set of Enderbound armor highly unlikely but incredibly annoying if you happen to encounter someone that does have it. If someone gets a full suit they basically have no death penalty unless they were killed at their spawn point and nothing can be done to counter it.Also weird in that the only one of these that has a consistent benefit and the only one truly useful for PvE is Guarding the only one without a downside. Two absorption hearts is pretty weak also arent they incapable of regenerating? or am I remembering wrong? but two of the set enchants only activate when you die extremely unlikely to happen in PvE if you have the resources to enchant four pieces of armor and the only remaining one is basically an alwaysactive Fire Resistant potion that rarely ends up being relevant due to the mostlystationary nature of lava and the ability to outheal the damage of fire.,minecraftsuggestions,czb16wo,3,t5_2s3oo

Also like sand if its attracted it would break and create the Falling Block entity and when it hits something it erases the entity and places an Iron block or Magnet depending on what became that entity. Falling block entities are used all the time in commands and mods.  As far as performance its simple for blocks. Moving a magnet performs a check for iron and they step closer until they touch then they check if they should fall. Item physics may be more complex but itd just be like gravity.

7382129,0,t1_d2h9y4a,That seems a bit too small and if you were to have twenty trees with hoppers all under them that would add up to  chests  planks and  iron ingots.EDIT Wait forgot that you can use water to move them to one hopper. My bad. Maybe each tree has on average hour?And per hour... you realize how long that will take for hour just to find an applestick?  trees   an hour. Is it really worth it for time and efficiency and space about x blocks minimum?  hour gt  trees  hour. This all takes up a lot of space to farm AND a lot of space for a forest AND takes  Minecraft days to get so if you play for  straight hours youd get on average  apples and sticks from  trees assuming you pick all of them up. If a person plays on average an hour a day  is what theyre gonna get.EDIT okay maybe hour might be enough and hour is too much now that I think harder.

This suggestion does both.Furthermore for what it is made of it should have a higher blast resistance than normal glowstone but that is not likely with the parameters of your post as it is easily destroyed by mobs especially the wither which is undead and which has an explosive attack.Finally we already have a sort of glowstone lantern and it is called the redstone lantern which os made of a total of  glowstone dust in block form and  redstone dust.There are more than likely people who downvotted you for one of these reasons.,minecraftsuggestions,d49h14h,4,t5_2s3oo

8780702,0,t1_d7374ey,You have a point going into the folder doesnt matter much but still having them all in separate files in a folder gives a better overview so I still think that that is better.Sorry I dont think I made it clear enough that the name of the file totally doesnt matter. You can call them whatever you want. All information about the crafting recipe is specified inside of the file.Also I dont think I fully understood the main purpose of functions. They actually allow you to copy NBT data from items used in the crafting recipe. That is actually a pretty cool idea and maybe something like that a functions tag should be added to my format.But there are some more things in your format that I find questionable. For example your format contains multiple lists of recipes one for each type of recipe. But isnt the type of recipe more part of the recipe itself? Therefore I think it should be specified in the recipe.So instead of something like this            shapeless             ...            ...            ...                fixed             ...            ...            ...            It should be something like this            recipes             type shapeless ...            type fixed ...            etc.            Lastly you are using slotX to specify which slot you need. So it looks something like this            slot ...        slot ...        slot ...    As a programmer I have experienced that it is way easier if you put such things in a list instead            items             Slot...            Slot...            Slot...

Even if its not totally realistic is all well and good but there should be some sort of reason for it beyond just Why not? If this were a fantasy biome then sure but Mega Taigas are perfectly realistic in all other respects.TLDR Rareness for the sake of rareness doesnt always make for interesting gameplay.

9670697,0,t3_5djkwb,I love this idea and i hope it will be implemented into the game.  Maybe you should power it with the drops from mobs that you want to keep from spawning.  In the overworld you would usually use flesh bones gunpowder string slimeballs eyes of ender etc.  In the nether you would use blaze rods ghast tears wither skulls and gold nuggets.  In the end eyes of ender dragon egg and shulker shells.  You should also need to use certain blocks to determine the distance of the area that is nonspawnable.  Itd be really cool if you could control it with redstone so if someone enters your base or something without you wanting them in it turns off and mobs start to spawn.

The crafting grid would store it as player data temporarily where it looks like a bigger stack but is actually a bunch of smaller stacks of the same item.You drop the item into the crafting grid you can get each item stack to visually go beyond normal limits but when you try to grab the modified stack to put it into your inventory you will only grab a normally limited stack and the remains would stay in the crafting grid.The moment you leave the grid all of the normally limited items drop all over the ground.So a  stack of cobblestone which is  if going by OPs rules is really just  stacks one of  the other as .Does that make sense to you?,minecraftsuggestions,da7ge2q,1,t5_2s3oo

Adding food items specifically to prevent people from starving defeats the purpose of having a hunger system at all. Zombies and spiders both drop food and if you have a plantable crop carrots work well and a hoe then skeleton bones can be turned into food as well.

When I read the title I assumed this was going to be one of those typical obsidian toolsweapon ideas thats just incredibly OP because obsidian is infinite but I actually dont hate this idea! I think this could actually be balanced with the range drawback!However I do think its a little bit silly to add obsidian shards. If the shards are only used to craft arrow heads why not just use an obsidian block in the recipe? Theres no real reason for the shards to be a thing.Also it doesnt really make sense to me that obsidian arrow couldnt be tipped in potions. I understand why you chose not to allow it from a balancing perspective but obsidian is a highly magical material Nether portals Ender chests enchanting tables. Maybe instead of being able to tip them in potions you could be able to enchant them? This would be an entirely new dorection for arrows. ,minecraftsuggestions,dbu36r8,6,t5_2s3oo

Everybody would do just what you described here. But that was not the premise behind the OPs suggestion. The premise was to remove enchants from books.  ampnbsp  gt Id say let the player use two books together where one is destroyed with the enchantments and the other is returned as a plain book.  ampnbsp  Using two enchanted books returning one as unenchanted is just fine in ordinary survivalmode play. It would be better when under timeconstraints  or a lack of leather  to use lapis. For instance in a UHC competition when youre having too much lapis and not enough leather.,minecraftsuggestions,deodm7p,1,t5_2s3oo

11585399,0,t1_dg97c4i,Well here it is...The GloomThe gloom is a dark damp and depressing world.  Light level is generally low due to the constant rains and the especially common thunderstorms with clear days being as rare as thunderstorms in the Overworld.  The terrain itself has smoother features and only gets half as high above sea level as it does in the Overworld.By far the majority of the land area is covered in jungles and dark oak forests however swamps are present on the coasts.  Lava springs only appear in caves below y   while caves below y   are flooded with water rather than with lava and are swarming with a new guardian variant called the glow guardian which has a weaker beam attack than the standard guardian is more likely to swim up to you and attack with spines that can extend further than those on other guardians and as its name suggests glows like spider eyes.Because the entire terrain of this dimension is thoroughly soaked from the constant rain nothing is able to burn in this dimension and fire will go out as if the gamerule doFiretick were set to false.  Furthermore dirt and grass blocks are replaced by soggy dirt and soggy grass blocks respectively which look like normal dirt and grass blocks except for having darker textures and can only be mined with a silk touch tool both blocks just dropping normal dirt otherwise.  Despite the low light levels and thunderstorms hostile mobs mainly spawn below y   in the dark dank caves and do not spawn on the surface except for in dungeons and where monster spawners are found.Woodland mansions are found occasionally in the dark oak forests however the mansions of the Gloom are creepier and have twists that are unique to this realm for instance they have basements and most public rooms above the basement have been partially or fully cleaned out.  The few furnished rooms and the basement are host to the few and generally more powerful illagers that live in these mansions with the sole evoker in any one of these mansions being tough enough to count as a fullfledged boss as opposed to a miniboss.The jungle temples found in the jungles of the Gloom are larger more complicated and more dangerous particularly as certain rooms contain zombie and skeleton spawners.  However their loot is more rewarding.Witch huts in the swamps of the Gloom are larger having a second room with treasure chests that potentially contain potions that you cannot craft normally such as stronger potions with long duration.  However there are always three witches in the area that will not despawn.Abandoned mineshaft networks are smaller and much rarer in the Gloom than they are in the Overworld and the wood in them is jungle rather than oak.  Otherwise the abandoned mineshaft networks of the Gloom differ very little from their Overworld counterparts aside from the frequency of different loot items.The unique dungeon in the Gloom is called the Gloom Crypt and as you might expect it is found underground.  It has walls and floors made of polished granite and andesite and spacious rooms loaded with waterworks like water fountains and water pools with the lowermost rooms of this dungeon being flooded.  There are also botanical garden rooms containing dark oak trees vines and swamp oaks and while the levels of these rooms containing the gardens themselves are decently lit the balconies above as well as most other rooms in the Gloom Crypt have no light at all.  Furthermore some of the larger flooded rooms on the bottom level also contain botanical gardens in areas that are above the waters surface and these rooms are lit in a similar fashion to other botanical garden rooms.  As might be expected there are horizontal notches in some of the hallways where one might look for a corpse in a real crypt and side rooms connected to these hallways may contain zombie and skeleton spawners. The large water pools in this dungeon including in the flooded rooms are swarming with glow guardians.  The boss of the Gloom Crypt is the Nightal an undead amphibious creature that in many respects resembles a fish with legs only halfrotten in a similar fashion to zombie pigmen.  You have to defeat the Nightal order to gain the item needed to access to the Glooms equivalent of the Nether.  Fortunately the loot from the Gloom Crypt is well worth the trouble.Music tracks heard in the GloomTrack Track What do you think?,minecraftsuggestions,dg97n85,2,t5_2s3oo

11626354,0,t1_dgdqvo3,You are right about the resource packs. But yeah I was just mentioning it as a solution to the complexity it adds although I fully understand that it isnt a valid argument against any suggestion.There are multiple types of complexity including things like being confused or overwhelmed by features having to do lots of calculations per second etc.But this also includes having to discover or learn about the feature in the first place.Normally it is not an issue but once there are too many blocks and items every single one of them adds to the complexity. The word complex doesnt just mean complicated but also large or consisting of many different parts. The feature may not be complicated but the game becomes more complex.Every single feature adds complexity. All of them. In all games.To cancel out or decrease its effect we must only add things that have a lot of depth to it so theres a lot to experience or learn. I dont think this feature would add too much depth so we should rather focus on deeper features in my opinion.Youre right about the stone variants though no idea why they added those.,minecraftsuggestions,dgduy4w,1,t5_2s3oo

11789526,0,t3_684ry1,Yes. This feature is already in many mods and would fit into the vanilla game really well.,minecraftsuggestions,dgwds1b,1,t5_2s3oo

11800938,0,t1_dgxnj3e,I dont think they will. Even though they serve a tiny purpose that most people dont use there isnt a point in removing them.,minecraftsuggestions,dgxoe1s,3,t5_2s3oo

11803824,0,t3_68dmzz,In the . update they really had my hopes up. The structure would be x rarer than a normal fortress and would be constructed from red nether brick. The netherwart here would be replaced with a yellow variant that glows slightly. You can brew it into haste potions or craft it into a glowing yellow netherwart block.There would be more spawners that spawn blazes magma cubes zombie pigmen and wither skeletons. There would also be hyper blazes that drop rods for making chest bigger furnaces more efiicent and making brewing stands faster. The chests would be more packed and contain better loot.There would also be undead knights who hold tempered swords. These swords are uncraftable and can only be obtained when they drop them. The knights would drop knight bones. You could craft a x of them to get knight bone blocks. Place  of these blocks in the world surrounding a beacon to summon the grand knight. This boss would be extremely difficult much more so than the wither. It would do  hearts of damage to an unarmored player and it would have  health. If you manage to kill it you would get a knight star which could be used to craft an ultimate item but only with several shulker shells as well... so what do you guys think? Do you like the idea or not? TLDR New rare structure made of red netherbrick that is more challenging has better rewards has a new difficult boss that drops a powerful item.TEXTURE IDEASFixed grammar and formatting and added concept textures. Your welcome!,minecraftsuggestions,dgy0634,4,t5_2s3oo
