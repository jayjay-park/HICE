475073,0,t1_cfu9ans,Its so difficult to tell people thats how you feel without coming off as bitter that youre all alone  But Im right there with you. Ive been single for about ten years now and although Id be open to relationships in the future Im honestly generally the happiest Ive ever been. ,modernromantics,cfu9oe9,4,t5_30pj9
476988,0,t3_1zja0t,Several times. The first I found out a guy I was seeing had a much longer term girlfriend when I saw her text him late at night after he fell asleep. The next guy I dated let me use his computer to do some work and I saw an IM convo seeking advice from his friend on what to do about a girl from yoga who he finally chatted up several months after noticing her. He said he loved me but maybe he should keep his options open. We attempted to get past that and I later found out he had risqu photos saved on his phone of women from like  years ago. The rd time was just this week I found out that yet another guy Im seeing slept with a bridesmaid while in New Zealand for a wedding despite texting me daily how much he missed me. Im at a point where I snoop unapologetically. Are there ANY honest guys left?? ,modernromantics,cfuhim1,2,t5_30pj9
477359,0,t1_cfug1s7,So much of this stuff boils down to an increased number of options. We had an interesting talk with Barry Schwartz who wrote The Paradox of Choice and also Sheena Iyengar whos done a lot of research on choice. Taking their research and applying it to dating was very interesting. Hopefully youll read about it in the book!,modernromantics,cfuj1dk,11,t5_30pj9
477779,0,t3_1zjfsl,I have nothing to compare it to as despite the fact that Im turning  Ive only ever been single. But if you ask me yes its exhausting. Probably more so for people like me than for others. I have a lot of pent up.. frustration with little release considering the values I grew up with. Its also very lonely I have that feeling of wanting to be nice and do things for someone else in a way that you can only when youre with somebody. Romances dramas are not always your go to choices because you have no one to comfort you at the end of the movie. And seeing couples that are amazing just bring out this emotion in you that really take a tole after a while.Curiously enough that has increased my desire to be in a relationship but not enough to change my standards in any way Another thing about my values you kind of date to get married which is not a MUST for me but its also somewhat contributed to my inability to compromise with what Im looking for. Btw if you having guessed Im a woman.,modernromantics,cfukrce,2,t5_30pj9
477926,0,t3_1zkig1,No way.  The exact opposite.  Theres a paper trail for everything.  My girl knows exactly who has commented on my status or who has been liking all my instagram photos.

481378,0,t3_1zjobr,Yes and for the better by miles.I opened a myspace account  years ago so I could see the pictures of someone I contacted online and thats been about it. I refuse to be on facebook because I spend enough time behind a computer programmer and reddits front page is close enough and watching the addiction level in my friends isnt encouraging. Seeing someone interrupt their own story so they can check his phones facebook notification is just the kind of future Im not interested in. I realize Im missing out on a lot but my true friends contact me and we go do human stuff together. And thats where I meet potential dates.That said my phone is on mute if not off entirely. I long for the days when people cant reach me whenever they feel like it and the low investment of texting makes it worse. When phones were bolted to the wall and there was no expectation of instant communication the absence of a response was not the social insult it is now. Ive missed out on parties a couple drunken booty calls no thanks and several issues Im glad I wasnt made aware of until the next day. Why yes Id love to come fight someone who called you a slut outside a bar at am. Thats a normal thing to ask of someone you just started dating.To take your question a step further I havent bothered with online dating in  years. If you can spell words like piqued correctly and dont use textspeak in replying to women youre already in the top . Id push for a date in the nd mail and if she was flaky Id tell her shes blowing it. Time and time again I get I appreciate your honesty and they come to the date prewarmed their laundry lists in tatters. I retired from it because peoples profiles are like the celebrities they want to be not who they are. I counter all this social technology by going out and doing things solo about  of the time. I approach women I like in public for the purposes of dating. I know sounds crazy and rapey. But frankly I can glean more in  minutes of face time than hours of emails. Exposing myself to rejection IN PERSON has all but cured my anxiety and only made me more grounded in myself and what I want. The world seems so full of opportunity when youre not scrolling through profiles in your underwear. ,modernromantics,cfuzi1b,1,t5_30pj9

540000,0,t3_208abu,I used to just pretend I was busy but then as it persisted I just did the blunt Im not interested honesty.  Currently Im going through a weird situation with regards to that and just make myself busy.  I have a guy who asks if Im free every day.  He is in my social circle so we do see each other regularly in groups but the awkward thing is that he is about to become roommates with the guy I was most recently seeing.  I did tell him when I was drunk that I wasnt interested but I think its coming to the time where I need to tell him sober.,modernromantics,cg1nkt3,1,t5_30pj9
545991,0,t3_1zji94,I am an american living in Thailand and I went on my first date in  year in thailand with a Thai girl.  It was very different.  Thai women are always approached by Farangs for sex so the attitude of worrying about sex or not wasnt there.  In the states its like if I play my cards right Im pretty sure I can lay her down but this date it was very clear from the beginning you try something funny its over.  There is this whole idea that men have come to thailand and every women is a sex worker and they will have sex with you like  its shaking your hand.  Which I am sure is true by how some of the girls on public transportation and  in public look at you but when you live here and are not looking for just sex but real love it is different.  Thai girls like older calm rich farang so they can be taken care of and not have to worry about money and food and things of that nature so they can get the new iphone very materialistic.  I am the opposite of that Young loud poor and energetic Thai girls call me Ting tong and mind you I dont drink or smoke and I am looking for the same.  I found one and went out yesterday we met on the internet thaifriendly.com to be exact which I dont usually do but the language barrier is much harder to overcome than I expected.  Anyway She can barely understand me and I can barley understand her.  But this girl is a dime with no tan line and I usually date  or  .  She was so nervous she couldnt look at my face and talk at the same time!   That made things very hard also I am a funny guy and I usually can make girls laugh all the time on dates but a woman who cant understand my jokes or references makes things really hard.  But we went to lunch then went and hung out in Queens park and hard a goodtime then we left.  I left gave her a confident hug and really never expected to hear from her again and then she called me that night telling me what a great time she had and that she was super nervous and wanted to see me again so she could make up.  So next week she is taking me to get a fish massage and then to a crocodile show! My perfect date!  So all in all Thai dating is amazing!  Beautiful girls who are intimidated by ugly americans.,modernromantics,cg2c3hn,1,t5_30pj9
567582,0,t3_20bje4,I want to give some contrast to the folks saying that Japanese parents generally arent cool with their children dating foreigners. When I was  I had something going with a Japanese girl that I met at my college in New York. I studied abroad in Japan the following school year and got to meet her and her family a few times. They were all super enthused that I was trying to learn the language and culture and her father strongly implied that he wanted his daughter and I to be longterm. It didnt seem to bother him in the least that I was a skinny white guy. I think if you make a sincere effort to meet people halfway or more across a cultural divide theyll do the same for you. This goes for dating and everything else.,modernromantics,cg4sfdg,12,t5_30pj9

1614066,0,t3_2csqn3,At first yeah just because you miss them but need to cut off most communication in order to get over them properly. Also it can get annoying when your friends insist on telling you about things they posted when you really dont want to hear about them at that point. But after a while its more like checking up every once in a while to see how they are and actually being happy for them if theyre happy with how things are going in their lives. Strategies get away from all social media the first week or two following the breakup youre only setting yourself up for disaster by reminiscing on their fb twitter etc. Also tweeting and subtweeting about your relationship andor your new life or whatever is generally just a bad idea. For me just taking a break from social mediatech really frees my mind and actually talking it out in person with a close friend makes it a lot easier to get over. If I can get over it without resorting to the internet I dont typically find the need to block them or be bitter about it. Ive actually been able to remain civil with my exes.,modernromantics,cjimbml,0,t5_30pj9
