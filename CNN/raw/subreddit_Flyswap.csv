2738461,0,t1_cnfbm2r,We encourage new hosts to have everyone tie a fly for themselves as well.  If the host opens  packages and then starts sorting hell have to figure out which fly each package should be missing based on user names and addresses.  Its easier to throw  sets together that are all identical and send them out to everyone.,Flyswap,cnfcnlr,1,t5_2svrj
2760442,0,t1_cmzjuax,Got my flies thanks for taking care of it and all my flies look great! ,Flyswap,cnhuo09,2,t5_2svrj
2932251,0,t3_2tq9gy,I love the idea. Cool way for everyone to be creative and show some different uses of a neat tying materialmethod. Heres my only problem. FS is awesome w this stuff and he and I have talked a bit over the last year or so about its usage and pros and cons. Whats the beef? We fish very different waters and species. His spoons posted below are gorgeous but Id never use em. Heres my type of UV fly for an illfated swap back in April.. ..pretty different. Just a thought! Im still interested though. That damn FS ties up some patterns good enough for me to carry around even if I wont fish them in my waters!,Flyswap,co1eq5f,1,t5_2svrj
3036073,0,t1_cocksvo,Nah.  They only take a few minutes apiece.  Its just a matter of figuring out the right order for the materials so I dont get everything covered in goo.,Flyswap,cocosfm,1,t5_2svrj

6356706,0,t1_czbaojq,I love watching Dave tie flies. There are basically no wasted movements or extra thread wraps or anything and he looks like hes doing it all haphazardly but hes not there is method to the madness. I would love to sit in a room and watch him tie,Flyswap,czc6rew,2,t5_2svrj
