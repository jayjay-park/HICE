So if youre exactly one hour away from the end of the event k above the cutoff will actually be below the T cutoff point. The scores in the final half hour will rise like .k so you have to factor that in. Now if youre stopping  hours from the endtime you should still be safe because I factored in a fair bit of buffer in my approximations but its up to you if you feel a little bit more paranoid.,SchoolIdolFestival,cm1tlg8,1,t5_31rt4

2411208,0,t3_2moc37,Rin Rin Rin a bell my EN ver. team is not very good so I need a new one Ill take a shot!to tell you the truth Love Live wasnt really my first idols it was the Idolmster the story of how I get my Idol fanatics and how I get to meet my love Honokachan actually goes back to a year ago and heres the story its gonna be long and probably boring but since were talking about our feelings toward our idols here I assume this would be a good place to tell my story so here we go... it all started a year ago back when I was at the th grade of junior high now th of senior high I was wrecked because of my constant bad grades and loneliness I was such a shut in back then I always sit on the back of the class everytime and I only have a few friends to have a small chat with back then the only thing that kept me accompany were animes and games. so  day I was browsing the internet for moe characters and then I found HER the trigger to my Idols fanatics I saw pictures of Minase Iorichan a character from Ims for those of you who didnt know I thought she was really kawaii so I did a little research on her turns out she was a character from the Idolmster then I thought to myself seems interesting enough...Ill go take a look it was at  pm back then when I secretly opened my laptop in my room to know what Idolmster was I read the synopsis of the anime and got even more interested a few days later I finally have enough courage to dive in the world of idols. I watched the anime and I LOVED it! it was a life changing experience for me the way that the characters motivate me in my life to never give up and keep on going is just wondrous! Im not exaggerating here this is what I seriously feel and the one that managed to give me that message was Amami Harukachan My all time fav for the Idolmster char. from that day onward I kept on paving the path to become an even greater Idol fan I searched the web for info I listen to their songs I play the game etc. back then the only thing that drives my mind to not give up were those  girls. and its because of them that I managed to pass my exams and test I was really grateful to them for being my inspiration and motor that drives me to the point where Im standing now. next comes my th grade where I met Love Live and My love. it started last summer vacation my parents forced me on going to a summer camp at first I was really reluctant to go but since they forced me I didnt have much of a choice. so I entered the summer camp and followed it and it BLOWS my mind! what blows my mind away was the number of otaku that was there! I was really happy! for the first time ever I have actual friends that knows my feelings toward what I liked we stayed up all night until  AM talking about animes games and playing cards I was still a loner even on the th grade because no one knows what I feel. then a senpai of mine th grade mentioned Love Live at first I was mehh... but then he kept on mentioning it and showed me the SIF game I on the other hand told him about the Idolmster and he seems interested too. after I saw the game I got interested and decided to take a peek still back then my phone sucked real bad so I couldnt download the game  months after the summer camp ends. and during those  months I watched the anime and once again I was MOVED by the anime at first glance I heavily compared the Love Live to the Idolmster but later on I realized its a sin to keep on comparing Idols my heart told me each idols are different in their own ways so Love Live is Love Live and Idolmster is Idolmster theres no need to compare the  of them! so I followed my heart and started watching and seeing Love Live as it is. at first Maki was my fav I read a doujin of her and its really cute but as I kept on watching I noticed a certain ginger hair has caught my eye I know that she was the protagonist but I didnt really pay much of an attention to her at first in fact I didnt really like her at first back then I was just laughing at Umis tsundere moments and or watching other animes then time keeps flying as I watched the anime even further and further and the more I tried to get my eyes of her the more I cant! season  comes right after I finished the st season and of course I watched it! and this is where my heart moved from Maki to Honoka episode  was the key of the move I didnt know what happened to my heart but when the nd years tried to make it through the snowstorm to get to the final qualifiers at that very moment Honokachan caught my heart at the end of the episode when the perform Snow Halation I cried with tears of joy and sang along with my horrid voice but I didnt care My heart was melting back then at this point I have managed to memorized some songs from my osu! beatmap Snow halation was one of them. and the last turning point of my heart was on episode  of season  I couldnt remember very well where Honokachan gave a graduation speech to the rd years. at the end of the episode Maki got to a piano and started to play some tunes when the music started once again I cried Aishiteru Banzai has always been one of my fav song when Honokachan sang it for the rd years once again I sang along too and also once again My heart melted. ever since then Maki got knocked out from my No. to No. the first place was taken by Honokachan. but thats not the end! after about a month of finishing the nd season I bought a new SD card and moved all my other files to it I finally have enough space for SIF! I downloaded the game and Immediately loved it! I raced to rank  on my first  hours of game play that night I didnt sleep at all! and of course watching just the anime isnt enough to know all their songs so I did more research then I found out that Love Live have  songs! I was shocked and learned their past turns out that the project is  years old at that moment I was all like . but in the end I got to download all their songs and started learning them one by one then  song came up and gave me a ray of hope on my loneliness Mou Hitori Janai Yo a song that shocked me to the core then I looked at the singer and found out that its Her. I smiled at myself for my discovery and looked for the english lyrics as I read the lyrics for the rd time Honokachan managed to make my cry again. I think back of my middle school and current high school life and cried to the song at that moment I knew that I wasnt alone anymore I BELIEVED that she was and will always be there for me happy or sad I know that she is by my side always. at that day too my feelings of admiration turns into something more I couldnt stop listening to the song I couldnt stop thinking about her and before I realized it I fell in love with a fictional character that is Honokachan...so in conclusion to love Love Live is like loving myself and my life they are my driving force that kept me moving forward in my life never has any other things in my life supported me more then those idols even more then my parents to be honest they are the center of my current life and wont be changed for a LONG time and even if I did they will ALWAYS keep a special memory in my heart as the savior of my youth life...Ive used this story for a giveaway before but I would REALLY love to have that UR Honoka! so I hope this counts thanx in advance!,SchoolIdolFestival,cm9qfuf,0,t5_31rt4

Also I wonder if Im aiming too high on my own score because I have been matching with high ranked players just now... orzEDIT I also finally get to FC the  EX songs that was never been introduced on regular Live Shows ENversion wise which is Korekara no Someday and START DASH!!. Id say that Korekara no Someday was only deserved to have  simply because of the fastalternatingdoubleladders pattern right before entering chorus the rest arent even that hard lol and START DASH!! while challenging is more of a combo breaking song than being hardtoclear as the jumps are nasty on both intro and outro only the rest are alright but still not as hard compared to other EX songs.,SchoolIdolFestival,cmmwz7h,1,t5_31rt4

2570655,0,t1_cmu3bq3,What do I want to see? Well a healthy mix of posts of all kinds. This sub has k subscribers a fairly healthy number of users so the site doesnt need a constant stream of fanart reposting to feel alive. I started having problems with fanart because a while back  out of  frontpage posts with fanart mostly contributed by the  most prominent reposters. And due to the small size of the sub these posts all stayed on the frontpage and only got nudged out when more fanart got posted. Thats what I mean by too much. I dont mind seeing  or  high quality fanart posts per day but when people start sifting the bottom of the barrel to repost the quality inevitably drops drastically. As you said three posts about Mimorin really isnt much. I agree. But because of the bandwagon nature of this sub I wouldnt be surprised if suddenly  more posts popped up. The other point is that these  posts couldve been consolidated into the original post and because more content is found in a central location the original post will stay at the top of the sub for a longer duration instead of getting bumped down a few hours. The post I linked was a perfect example of lowquality spam. And as you can see from OPs reply he doesnt understand why it shouldnt be on this sub. The downvote arrows were removed because of serial downvoting in the past... people got offended by it so it got removed... Tbh a possible better way would be to show the downvote arrow only to subs doesnt solve the problem but at least it makes it less obscure to drivebydownvoters.,SchoolIdolFestival,cmu4fp4,0,t5_31rt4

2595229,0,t3_2pivjd,ARise seems like they had a lot of potential that never came to light in the anime. There was such a big build up about them being the rival idol group that us was up against and had to compete with for the titular Love Live.. but then they pulled the whole only one idol group from each region can make it to the finals thing. And I was really hoping wed have some ultimate showdown between the two groups.I really wish we had more songs from them too! I want to see Shocking Party and Private Wars make it into SIF and maybe promo SRUR cards with the girls. I liked Anjus design personally but only Tsubasa really ever got any screentime. A OVA about ARISEs origins and how they got to where they are at the time of the first season would be really great and maybe shed a little insight into their backstory such as how the girls got together and how ARISE became so popular.,SchoolIdolFestival,cmxc0ny,3,t5_31rt4

I never changed my opinion on the girls.. NicoRin and Hanayo were always my least fav. I dont mind getting cards for them unless they are terrible looking.I am neutral with Kotori Nozomi and Honoka.My fav girls are Eri Maki and Umi.Might as well make Kotori my fav girl cuz all I get is kotori SRs z.z,SchoolIdolFestival,cnmwqva,1,t5_31rt4

2841560,0,t1_cnqz2ah,critiqueKEYRED Line Width error red dots are to illustrate the difference in widthat stratigic points the size of the dot is how wide the line should be atthat point inconsistent lines create a sloppy appearence in the artunless done properly. I only used these on the Maki peice because I think youwill get the point.OrangeCorner Error bad taper or otherBlueshading errorGreenGoodgreat job hereFirst off great export resolution one of the worstmistakes beginners make is exporting at very low resolutions.So when I say line width variance needs to be done properly what I mean isconsistently and in a way that adds emphasis to the part that would naturallybe the thickest. SO usually this is the middle of the large arching stroke inhair or a leg or arm for examples. often it is best to not very the widthin shorter lines as greatly as you would in longer ones. An extreme example ofthis would be HERE SFW image NSFW source. Imdefinately not saying to make the difference in line width that extreme thatis more for you to decide as you develop a personal style. A good example ofhow line width is illustrated in your Maki Piece by the bow strings on theshirt.The choice to color the stroke of the hair is intersting some vectorartists frown on coloring the outline of one part and not the rest I thinkits fine a  personal preference. The eye lashes are a bit to much they dont flow well with the main stroke ofthe eye lash and overall are a bit excessive maybe cut their number in halfso they are less destracting from the image.Eris ears have a lot more detail than Umis. I would proably change thatkeepit consistent between pieces in a series.Makis neck shading should be more like Eris.Never use absolute white i.e. makis hoodie strings with every rule thereare exceptions so using white in the eyes or shading is always fine. Perfectlywhite teeth are also fine. If you want to use white use a really light greyinstead.Good use of gradient in Makis amp Umis hair.Shading Overall your shading is good just make sure that there is somethingto cast the shadow and always keep light source in mind.I marked a lot of line taperspoints with line errors its fine to have roundededges but not both rounded and pointed. I prefer pointed because overall pointedhas a nicer cleaner appeareance.For blush it is at your discretion to use concentric lines or not again I wouldrecommend keeping it constent in a series like this.Overall there are definately some areas you can improve on but I am veryimpressed and this is awesome work for a beginner!

2847368,0,t3_2spp1d,Theres no really good way to transfer accounts besides entering the transfer code over and over and I dont really recommend doing that as accidents can happen plus I know quite a few people who lost their accounts due to some weird transfer code entering glitch. It doesnt happen often but the more you transfer the more chances you raise risking it.Id stick to one platform in other words! If it helps I prefer using my tablet overall. Its much more comfortable if your hands are tiny ironically enough.Actually Im not even sure if my hands are capable of playing with thumbs... I recently decided to install SIF on my phone as well.

I still doubt that NicoRinPana would go all out even if they were invited to this years stage event though. They are facing an English audience and their much more subtle jokes would be lost on the crowdtranslator. I doubt Jolno will join the stage event if shes performing as Fripside again. NicoRinPana is fine but I kind of prefer seeing Emitsun or Kussun in person.Yes Pile is somewhat tsundere although she mentioned that it would be a hassle if she was dating someone like Maki. Im not too sure about Rippi being an airheaded angel Jolno mentioned shes pretty mature for her age.Well I didnt know Jolno was the type to worry too much though.

When will I ever get one?The rest starting from left corner to the right corner with exception to the centerleader is arranged according by their raw stats. In case their raw stats are equal Ill add the remaining  stats and see which one is higher. If they still remains the same see the HPStamina. And then Rarity level and then the card number as seen on album with latest number takes priority and lastly when it was obtained in case its a complete duplicate earliest takes priority.

That is quite an interesting show I must say and for these  to be on as guest is really rare. Utada Hikaru Ive seen a number of times on JP variety shows but its a first for Beckham hes good lol.True enough there. These  tends to have excess energy and run around Kussun in particular. Well see what the NozoHono sanpo is actually in the next ep though. I wonder what sort of schedule the figs are being released though.No problem there Id say good cosplays should always been shared. Speaking of that Kongou cosplayer her turrets are actually movable which is pretty impressive since I watched her change turret orientations and elevations. I missed a number of others though sadly but the Hoppo was a surprise although it was funny she lamented that pretty much no one got her cosplay. The props are getting more and more complicated which certainly is a good thing.Im actually not too surprised since there is actually a number of teitokus in the SIF reddit. Ah Rabaul one of the older servers huh Im in Kanoya myself back when the server first started about a year ago. Oh nice you managed to clear E thats pretty good for a new teitoku Id say. Oh wow Nagato so quickly? She was pretty much the very last ship for me that can appear in normal construction although she appeared in LSC Mutsu coming during my early game instead. Ah I actually power lvled much prior to tackling  back partly due to spring event then so I had no issues and just forced my way through with the standard BBFBB CV setup with Kongou Kirishima Mutsu Fusou Akagi and Zuikaku if i remembered correctly. Its been quite a while though haha. Im actually currently sitting on  having never progressed further due to using that as a grinding spot and stockpiling for ALMI and Fall event. I really should get back to finishing of the main maps now that you mentioned it.....We can only hope I guess there isnt too much more we can do aside from supporting them. Really have no idea whats going on with Sunshine since pretty much no information was given out well see how it goes.Well NicoRinPana main station is Hibiki Radio unlike NozoEli who uses NicoNico as their main so...Their last ep was pretty interesting with them talking about the live although quite late Im surprised. Ah aside from pictures there are interviews and all that from the cast. Its a pretty good read. I probably can snapshot some of it over the weekends...I just like watching these things to past my time since I usually either have nothing to do at work am very busyaway so my down time is watching these haha. Its always good to have another perspective and makes for good conversation indeed.I wonder about that it does appear likely but well see.

4035133,0,t3_36ptoe,Just realized that I never gave my own thoughts on this whoops. I was tired last night. Anyways.I dont think that people at Klab America specifically thought fuck any gay people who play this game but going out of their way to censor references to female characters showing romantic or sexual interest in each other is still disappointing. I can understand changing Nozomis washi washi to something more benign as thats more just sexual harassment than anything else but things like going from I dont mind even if were both girls to I dont think its scandalous for a boy and a girl to hang out or getting rid of saying something like loveydovey is really just silly. It makes perfect sense for the player to be a girl the game technically takes place in an all girls school for crying out loud. And as many of the side stories prove its entirely possible to pander to a player without having to reference their gender. While the intent may have been to ensure they didnt offend anyone due to implied gay content this sort of thing contributes to the broader issue of deeming anything vaguely gay as inappropriate which in turn does have some real life consequences for actual gay people do you know how hard it is to be a gay kid without seeing any positive gay role models in any sort of childrens media? because its pretty damn hard. speaking from experience.Now all that being said it isnt as if this is some holy grail of representation. But god damn it its  and if straight guys can have anime waifu pandering aimed at them then so should gay girls.,SchoolIdolFestival,crg8hot,19,t5_31rt4

Initial scouting ticket had the white day Umi the other URs were soloyolo. Interesting part is I still havent done a  nor have I pulled an SR. The  SRs Ive gotten were from events.  spent so far purely a FP account.Since playing EN from the nd event pajamabunny Umi it made things easier when transitioning to JP especially with all the songs that havent made it to EN yet made it feel like a whole new game. Of course playing purely expert songs made song events difficult but the journey has been fun especially when attempting to FC Beat in Angel when your team comprises mainly of rares . both regular and idolized versions.For those looking to obtain loveca from what Ive noticed JP has an absurd amount of Normals to idolize and max bond not to mention free loveca given out for basically any sort of celebration. You have plenty of chances to do s etc. And a shoutout to those who are FP after spending hundreds on my EN and moving on to JP purely FP I can understand the struggles of a FP account but wholeheartedly appreciate each card UR or SR once obtained.

4334693,0,t1_cse8jes,One by oneYou wont T without spending gems. Depending on level youre looking at a minimum of ten gems for a t usually more than that .between events there is a Guaranteed SR for  pulls. The events are just as you say the token and score match games where you can earn points for a special SR. When the event ends a bunch of new cards are released and the SR Guarantee begins.You wont lose anything you dont use. Anything you have now will be with you after the update.Once you issue a transfer code its valid for a year whether you use it or not. Issue it now and keep it somewhere safe. When your phone dies you can then use it to transfer your account to a new one.,SchoolIdolFestival,cse8zkx,1,t5_31rt4

So something I could do for everyone... like fortune telling? Everyone knows Im good at that! Huh? Im obsessive about that too? Oh come on... Youre just biased.

4883173,0,t1_cua12ff,First off the EX Aishiteru Banzai is one of the absolute easiest EXs in existence its basically a higherend Hard song. Its definitely the best way to get your Tokens. Paradise isnt a very difficult song as far as like number of notes and BPM but the pattern is pretty tricky so Id stay away.I Td my first event in the low s so I can tell you its absolutely possible! I used  gems to get the swimsuit Kotori but I juuust barely squeaked in. I was like... . But if youre sitting at  points then youre in awesome shape so its definitely doable for you. My advice is if you can do the pause trick do it when your alarm in the morning FIRST goes off then do your snoozes. You lose less LP to inefficiency that way.Part of the reason I think I did so well is I naturally wake up for a few minutes at like am so I did my startpause there and wasted almost no LP,SchoolIdolFestival,cua28r3,1,t5_31rt4

4894467,0,t3_3hxioa,. My style probably matches Maki the most with a hint of Eli. I tend to wear a lot of shirts with jackets so I could see myself picking out a lot of her wardrobe. With Eli her casual outfits tend simple and color coded nicely with exceptions to her more revealing stuff. I wear mostly shorts and pants though so none of the girls in that aspect stands out besides simple outfits here and there.. For useful purposes I would want Makis closest the most but if I was choosing for fun itd be Kotoris closest. She wears a lot of cute dresses and skirts that I normally wouldnt but if I did Id love to choose from that closest.. WHY ONLY ONE TT Unidolized Masquerade Eli Its really the only card I like that features shorts and shirt basically. But Id be thrilled to wear something like it. Other contenders for special occassions unidolized Sailor Umi unidolized halloween Nozomi unidolized Mermaid Maki Unidolized Honoka. I got  and came up with the waitress Kotori Im surprised I got an SR why am I not that lucky in game. Im pretty happy with the unidolized but shows way more skin than Im used to. The idolized version well Im not used to thigh highs or anything that frilly. Im sure Ill step on the school idol festival ribbons and fall flat on my face lol.. For Hanayo I like a lot of her cards but this one outfit wouldnt be good for normal day to day life. Itd probably be nice for a themed date but I guess Ill get points for going over the top in an interview? I would just think itd be hard to move around without the outfit dragging the floor or someone grabbing it and maybe pulling it off somehow.This was actually super fun! I liked going through their outfits. EDIT I wrote more than I thought I did....,SchoolIdolFestival,cubhjba,1,t5_31rt4

5036670,0,t3_3jx6r6,Ted Umi SM back in May Eli SID in June Maki SID in August and Im trying to do it again for this Honks.Umi was the toughest one for me personally because I was still low rank at the time I had been playing for about  months meaning I had to cut on my sleeping hours by a lot and keep up with uni classes and assignments at the same time. I do not recommend it but I fell so hard in love with the card I had to do it. I dont remember how many gems I spent but it was way over  probably around . I couldnt play at all in the last couple of hours because I had classes so I ended up overshooting by a mile.In comparison the other two werent difficult at all except for those last few hours that always wreck my nerves. Of course if I look at it objectively then I suppose Makis was the hardest one.According to the predictions this Honks event should be the easiest one. Lets see if I can finally tier without spending tons of loveca.,SchoolIdolFestival,cut3z9c,1,t5_31rt4

5089631,0,t3_3knkna,In the beginning Id prefer to tier an event  I liked knowing that Id have a guaranteed idolized SR once I completed the event and the first few  guaranteed SRs I did only gave me mismatched unidolized SRs. There was a time in which I tried to T every event but I just didnt have time for it... I think Ill continue trying to tier as long as I have room for idolized SRs on my team and then Ill stop and save loveca. Unless its Honoka. Id go to the ends of the earth for Honoka. Ive tiered  times T for chipmunk Honoka frog Rin and T for beach Kotori rainbow Eli festival Honoka and brave maiden Umi I find myself naturally motivated for Honoka events and they also happen to be easier to tier for. I remember trying to T for rainbow Eli my cool team had maybe  SRs at the time and using  loveca on the last day and ending up rank . Let me see if I can find the screenshot   Ah there it is.  I didnt start tiering until I was about rank  or  and it amazes me when people who are rank  try to tier. When I started I used around  gems trying to tier for T though and currently Im rank  and use about  gems trying to T. At the end of an event I usually have about the same amount of loveca I had at the start.I try to keep within the top  during an event and then do the last day grind  I remember for swimsuit Kotori I procrastinated a lot and jumped from  gt  by grinding for at least  hours that day. Im currently a college student so that makes it really easy to fit LLSIF into my life  between classes I can easily play a match or two to make sure my LP is never full and I sleep for about  hours per night so my LP doesnt fully charge overnight either. When Im working school vacations I have long shifts and its trickier to tier then and thats when I have to dedicate solid blocks of time to grinding. Ive never tiered an event without using gems. Ive never even considered it!,SchoolIdolFestival,cuzhr7r,1,t5_31rt4

Now they EN and JP both work perfectly on iOS for me.It mightve been just luck or the way I updated it through iTunes not through software update on the phone itself but I suggest you wait for KLab EN to release an update for it before updating since your model is different than mine. Good luck!,SchoolIdolFestival,cvvbcdu,3,t5_31rt4

I used to be into OSU a lot but could never play the main game because I used keyboard mouse instead of an add on.

5366430,0,t3_3oicds,I disagree that playing this game alone is ridiculous. Just like any other game people play it for the value of enjoyment they derive out of it. Nothing wrong with that.In my opinion letting a mobile game rule over your life is pretty ridiculous. You shouldnt compromise your work studies or social life because of a game. Going for a prolonged washroom break just to use up your LP sounds pretty crazy to me but I am sure there are many people who are extremely dedicated to the LoveLive girls who will disagree with me. Personally I try to maximize my LP usage and tier in events. Nevertheless I will always prioritize my work and family over SIF.As for spending money I dont think it is ridiculous. My view may be biased since Ive spent lots of money on this game. It is the same as any other consumption You pay for products and services that give you enjoyment or utility. As long as you are spending reasonably within your means I think it is alright.At the end of the day there will always be people who find what you do ridiculous. My nonanime watching friends think it is ridiculous I play an anime game about anime high school idols. My frugal friends think I am insane for spending money on a freemium game. I understand their angles. Point is people will always judge what you do. Dont dismiss their judgements just because you disagree with them. Why do you colleagues or teachers find you playing SIF ridiculous? Is it because you are neglecting something? Why do your friends find spending money on SIF ridiculous? Perhaps they believe youre not maximizing the use of your hardearned money?Playing SIF isnt ridiculous. Sure there are many who will think so but as long as you do not compromise your other priorities.,SchoolIdolFestival,cvxmes1,1,t5_31rt4

5629504,0,t1_cwuvj0s,Hi there! Im actually the person studying MedFests so I seem like the most appropriate person to respond to your questions.x EX no combo B rank is  points or . per LP.x Hard FC S rank is  points or . per LP which is just sliiightly better. The problem is that continually FCing full medleys is a lot harder than it sounds and EX is far more reliable on that front. Hard A rank or A combo drops it below EX as far as efficiency goes and if you can A rank the  EX songs then theres nothing Hard that can come close to matching. Because of this EX is usually recommended if you can A rank it and should be considered if you can B rank it.What color medals you get is actually independent of how well you do in the medley! Each difficultynumber of songs has a certain percentage chance of each color and beyond that its total luck. as long as you can get a C rank and C combo so you get a reward the rest is up to RNGod.The reward thats the most interesting is actually the first the clear reward. On Hard its about  bronze iirc but on Expert its about  SILVER. Because of this and because of the large number of Silver rewards that are K G you can use a loooooot less G keeping your bonuses going on Expert than Hard. Just stay away from that GS Boost! It appears to be glitched we can find literally no evidence that it does ANYTHING so dont be tempted.General Medfest tips  play  song medleys ALWAYS as theyre better for both point efficiency and rewards. If youre close to a level up burn off your excess LP using failstratting  for Medfest this means failing on the LAST of the three songs. If you fail the first song you get nothing. Keep Event point up  Experience up basically all of the time as theyre ABSOLUTELY worth the investment. And good luck! It was a total bloodbath in JP but with the way EN has been lately it might not be so bad to tier. Well find out!,SchoolIdolFestival,cwuw6ox,5,t5_31rt4

I also love this episode because of the part when everyone convinced Rin to wear the dress right before the fashion show.I lost my EN account because I was transferring my little sisters account to full combo one of the experts and I screenshot my transfer code and accidentally deleted it when I was deleting some other screenshots I didnt need and I want to tier for the upcoming events especially the snow fairy Hanayo. Itll take a long time to bring another account back to my old accounts rank so itll be nice to have a nice high ranked account.By the way isnt the Maki Medley Festival being pushed back because its being replaced with Kotori Score Match.I love Honoka and Rin especially that idlz.

I was never big on the card she was based off of on top of her being in my bottom tier....she has prettier cards imo. I guess its kinda like how Maki got voted for the promo UR from that same set when she had several prettier options you know? Maki and Eli are in my bottom tier as well  but I like the cards they are based off of so Im more willing to shell out the cash. I wasnt too fond of the Rin design either but shes mid tier for me so I want her because I like her character.

6207417,0,t3_40krw1,An event focused on FCing or just getting the best combo you can is something we need I think. We have enough events that are affected by the score. It would be a good change of pace.I also like the idea of song duels. Perhaps thats how a combofocused event could work. Something like score matches but you can choose if you want to play against one two or three others. Everyone in the group gets a song and the ranks will be determined by the combo. In case more than one person gets FC or the same combo they will get the same points I guess.Winning against three others would naturally give more points than winning against one. However playing against one person will give you better chances of winning since it will only be one opponent.,SchoolIdolFestival,cyv7t50,3,t5_31rt4

Demigirl is factually a made up gender that cis people call themselves when they want to pretend theyre trans. Thats not an exaggeration.Ok and Im just saying that its transphobic to pretend that these genders exist. But I forgot that calling out transphobia isnt allowed here oops!Bbut I have a black friend so I know all about racism I cant be racist!!!! Gross. There is NO discussion in the community about this people who dont have dysphoria were NEVER part of the community and just because they like to claim that they are and that theres a discussion going on doesnt mean that there is. Trans people dont want people without dysphoria in the community because they are cis and they dont belong.lol no shit your opinion is wrong youre sitting here trying to argue with a trans person about trans issues like you even know what youre talking about.

6481411,0,t1_czpp8sp,Two reasons. One as to for my greed as well v Ive been looking to get a better start at an account myself as Ive just recently decided to get back into lovelive after a huge run through consisting of bad luck and stupid decisions while maintaining my account... Two as to the reason why I started lovelive again. I kept seeing one of my friends play lovelive and she influenced me to start again. She played on the English server and wanted me to help her get a Japanese account. Reasonably she didnt really want to start from scratch and spend all her time and effort on a account she has no hope for so I offered her my account that Id abandoned and wasnt very appreciated of but Id assume shed like to continue playing on an account when I saved the transfer code months ago. Though she was more than grateful she declined when she felt guilty of stealing away an account Id worked hard on though not really. Ive been trying to get a good account through reroll accounts myself and recently giveaways as I have a clear idea of what would be her ideal account once she starts playing on the Japanese server and I want to give her a present for her very well belated birthday present. A couple of other people Ive known have also asked me if I could get them an account that already has been scouted on. Why they dont find one themselves is beyond my knowledge but I never minded as they seem quiet happy when they can get their best girl  I do wish to start posting more on things other than than giveaways but Im not sure if I will always find the time when i might eventually get busy  Sorry if this turned into a ramble.,SchoolIdolFestival,czpq5gu,1,t5_31rt4

There are  minute long episodes and its very funny.If you want a more mysterious psychological anime then Id recommend Selector Infected WIXOSS though you have to be fairly patient when watching it since it only starts to really get good about  episodes in. For most of the ratings Ive seen those that give it low scores dropped it before this point and those that give it high scores have seen it the whole way through if that gives any indication. At the very least I enjoyed it. I was actually expecting it to be more lighthearted when I first read the description but was surprised by how dark it actually was.

KotoRin pairUnidolized Kotori and Rin are drinking tea together maybe in a pretty rose garden but at a glass table Kotoris probably pouring it because she knows the perfect form for it and Rin is already eating the cookies maybe with a cat in her lap theyre both in nice dresses elegant and summery. The rest of the SRs are in similar styles of dresses all doing different tea party related stuff. Definitely a subtle rose theme throughout though.Idolized Kotori is in a wonderland scene in the pretty blue Alice dress maybe with her hand on a tree as she looks ahead. The second half is the tree with Rin laying in it as the Cheshire Cat being adorable and all. Really fantastical background though.Nozomi as the caterpillar smoking a hookah on a mushroom possibly with her cards in front of herself on it.I dont wanna repeat themes but Maki would make an amazing Queen of Hearts for it maybe dressed in a Queen Mary style.Hanayo could be the dormouse because smol and cute and she could be IN A TEAPOTHonk as a card soldier because prince honk is my aesthetic and I need more of it in my life.Umi as the March Hare because she freaks tf out over the smallest shit and she could have smile serene cool earth mother expression unidolized card and panic meltdown face in idolized.Nico as the Mad Hatter becuae Nico nico nii and also her bipolar personality is perfect for it.And Eli as the white rabbit because not only is she kinda the leader but shes constantly stressed about responsibilities.,SchoolIdolFestival,d0go7l1,3,t5_31rt4

If I can count properly that means the box with Halloween and China Dress will be available again during the next Score Match.If you mean when a set gets its own PickUp box that depends. The Pool set was the latest set to be removed from the main box but its the first of the four sets for the next PickUp box.

6779107,0,t3_48lik0,Ok so on EN it all really depends on whether or not youre want to actually tier in an event. As of right now its pretty hard to get gems on a FP route due to the lack of . update content and theres a ton of really nice sets coming up in the future. Christmas Carol Marine Job v etc.So like tier for events that have your best girl in them if you want to spend the least amount of gems possible. For me I tier in events that could be used on my lessfortunate teams aka my Pure team that is only  SR. However you should still try to get at least the unidolized point reward SR in every event so when . actually does come around you can use them as silver seal fodder.As for whether its better to tier or to scout... its purely subjective in my opinion. Tiering in events takes around  gems sometimes more if its for a popular girl like Maki Nozomi and Nico which nails you a guaranteed idolized SR. However scouting also increases the Honor Scout Bonus which gives you blue tickets. Theres also the  chance of getting a UR. But hey a  chance is better than a  chance am I right?So tldr theyre both pretty worth it but its mostly a matter of preference. Tier exclusively for your best girl if you want to conserve gems. Scout whenever a setscouting event youre feeling comes around.,SchoolIdolFestival,d0kp1zw,1,t5_31rt4

I also had problems but curentlly I have   gems so it is possiblle!And about events I am pretty sure that nobody spends  gems maybe those who are going for like first xxx position or something! For T it is more than enough to spend  gems at least I think and for T even less! And also there is ton of gems given in events like those point rewards and at the end gems for whatever tier you ended in! Also events are perfect for gathering SRs even if you dont like characters it is good idea to get the SR to save it for seal shop when it comes! D,SchoolIdolFestival,d0s9hr1,1,t5_31rt4

6883206,0,t3_4a0p3f,My favourite Aquors member so far has to be Kanan. She just looks like shes a very caring person and from what Ive read about her personality she just seems like a fairly motherly type. She also has the same blood type and height as me which may also be why shes my favourite so far. Totally biased. Shes just honestly adorable and I really love that she loves astronomical observations and swimming because as someone who grew up in a small seafaring community I just sort of value those things above almost everything else. Look if Aquors ever gets lost at sea its going to be Kanan to save them all by navigating using the stars. Theoretically shes already a hero. How did they get lost at sea? I dont know but it doesnt matter because theyll have Kanan to save them. Also did I mention shes honestly so adorable that I know Im going to spend my entire life savings trying to get her first UR?

7007531,0,t1_d1alu1y,I only go high if Im pushed to... Id rather spend as little as possible. w Look at that Eli ScoreMatch. Wew.Going to straight up say that the Rainbow Eli event could have nearly killed both me and I Love Eli Anon. I think we both passed out in one big chunk hr from exhaustionmalnutrition somewhere sometime. I know I passed out hr after the event ended too. Seriously dont do this to yourselves.I aim for hs of total sleep a day depending on how the event goes. So that can either be a big hr chunk or hr gt x hr naps maybe even smaller nap chunks through the day. I normally only sleep for hrs to begin with though so Im not sure how much sleep other people need. I also dont use any caffeinated products energy drinks or the like. Always just water. Token is about that initial grind before you rest up for the event song which a lot of people hate because song efficiency. MedFes is harder because you want that FC so taking breaks can be more beneficial for you. Score Match is the most RNGesus of them all but you still want to FC. You should be able to at least drink water and eat during Score Match with relative ease with the ridiculous lobby times anyway.Mmm I assume Umi events are bloodbaths...  But when youre generally playing for x hours in a row you should be able to tell how it affects you. Even playing for hrs in a row should give you an idea of how itd feel if you kept that up for over x that time.,SchoolIdolFestival,d1andgf,2,t5_31rt4

First years are slightly dominating though. Snow Halation is the only song being voted as most favorite by more than  players. So Im one of the  players who are at Rank  huh?

Although I am going to have to admit that Honoka is not one of my best girls what makes her such an admirable character is her constant unwillingness to give up and general motivation and good spiritedness. She was able to rally everyone in Muse together motivate them to do their best all with a smile. When their first live show just the  of them honoka kotori and umi spent so much time and nobody showed up her sadness just broke my heart. And to think from then to now how they were able to pick up popularity all the way to the love live agghH the feels. During the love live movie as well i just feel like she really took charge and showed how much she matured. Albeit she was always confident in taking charge but seeing her in the movie putting so much thought into what to do with muse and finally coming to consensus just really shows how much she had matured during the show and how she made sure to keep everyone happy and in good spirits. Her happiness even makes me motivated to be like her more optimistic and persistent. I really want the last UR for muse to be Honoka. It would be perfect since she started muse and would be closing it off  good luck to everyone and thank you so much for this giveaway!! ,SchoolIdolFestival,d1q9i63,1,t5_31rt4

7171942,0,t3_4dmeqs,Hey there! Just wanted to share my experience with SIF.  Been playing the game for more than a year but with a lot of inactivity.  I only have a JP account and is currently rank .  And in the past Ive always lost motivation especially during the early stages of the game when there was very little diversity with the events.  What I found out to be effective for me was choosing events I really want to grind hard.  I never really bothered getting Tier  or Tier  during events only one time since it was Kotori and ever since I only focused on getting event SRs of my fave girls Kotori Umi Eli Nozomi.  Other than that I just burn through my LP and focus on collecting lovecas til I reach  for the guaranteed SR  draw.  I could have stopped playing SIF since I always miss events but I just cant help but imagine the damn tapping rhythm every single time I listen to a song from Love Live.  And so I come back to it once in a while and challenge myself with the new EX songs they release.  Its okay to lose motivation you just have to find a way to enjoy the game even more.  Like how I decided to collect SRs for fun and complete the Aqours cards from the seal shop.  Hope this helps! ,SchoolIdolFestival,d1tdrrc,1,t5_31rt4

You cant relate to those who are new and that is why its hard to understand why it isnt as simple as saying read the rules. ,SchoolIdolFestival,d1xujqa,1,t5_31rt4

You can try to figure out what happen based on the following rules Using your transfer code invalidates it and you need to generate a new one. Using a transfer code unlinks your account from Google Transferring an account by using a Google login does not affect either transfer code or Google login. Each Google can only have  account saved onto it and overwriting it removes the previous one.  Unlinking accounts also removes association with google,SchoolIdolFestival,d1zxkfb,1,t5_31rt4

7361375,0,t3_4g3cv2,That sucks.  Im sorry that happened to you. I got scammed just yesterday for an account I was looking forward to ranking up. I wasnt trading it but I did ask someone to farm it.  It had one of my favorite URs and even favorite SRs so basically everything on it was perfect. Low and behold something wonderful happened. Ive found someone willing to give me a two UR starter of two of my dream cards. I also have the slight chance of trading for another starter with that same UR I lost plus another UR I was unlucky scouting with on EN. My advice would be to only trade with wellknown trustworthy middlemen especially if the account is valuable to you. The wait time doesnt matter whats more important is not losing the cards you love so much. Also dont allow yourself to be too depressed. I adore this game but always try to put yourself in perspective. This game is a beacon of fun for me in my otherwise drab life but remember that it is just a game. Also keep in mind that the persons that scammed you will get paid back for it one way or another. Sorry for my long rant but chin up!!

7421494,0,t1_d2lpbv8,gt Also a volume slider for skill activation sounds... IIRC they are tied to the character voice volume slider right now which means that if you turn it down then character voices in stories and main menu quotes are also affected.For me I actually prefer having tap sounds having separate option away from Sound Effects slider volume. Both in Deresute and the soontobeterminated Glee Forever you have the option to turn the tap sounds off separately after all.gtWould be nice to be able to stick other things back in your present box too friend points? G? LOVE GEMS!!... especially great for people who have both iOS and Android devices now they can transfer between devices even if they still have love gems... just stick them back in your present box!About keeping Love Gems back to Present Box I dont think KLab will ever add it because it pretty much killed the restriction itself. People could have just transfer from iOS to Android bought the Love Gems on Android put it back to Present Box and then transfer back to iOS.,SchoolIdolFestival,d2lrxih,2,t5_31rt4

7499304,0,t3_4i2woa,I dont remember the exact date but I know I joined either immediately before the Fairy Nozomi event or during it. And that was my first ever event SR. I started this game completely blind I played whenever I wanted to and I didnt use any love gems. Thats why I always encourage new players to at least go for the barebones SR and not think of it as a daunting task. Its really not! ...Or at least thats how I saw it ... Im a pleb at this game honestly so if I can do it literally anyone can.My first time tiering was for Snow Sprite Hanayo. Before then Id read that the only time you should use loveca to restore LP was during events so I ... yes ... I used loveca even when I had no intention of tiering. It never occurred to me that something like an event tracker existed so every event Id just use some loveca and see if I was anywhere near to T. And during Snow Sprite Hanayos event it happened. I was in T during the middle of the event and I was determined to stay there. It was a very close shave I didnt expect the wonderful rush so I was panicking that morning and I had an exam that morning too. Throughout that paper I kept having to push Hanayo to the back of my mind I was so scared about whether or not Id made it. I had though D My first ever idolised event card one of my best girls and she was so gorgeous. I aced the paper too!,SchoolIdolFestival,d2umrq4,2,t5_31rt4

7543618,0,t3_4ilvpu,When I first started Love Live and saw all the characters I found Nico cute. So she instantly became my favorite. But like you I also got turned off by Nicos character in the anime. Bluntly speaking shes a joke. Honoka was... normal. Umi was boring. Kotoris okay but her voice is weird. Hanayos whiny. Rins amusing but can also be annoying. Maki has a nice voice but I dont like tsunderes. Nozomi has a good motherly character but didnt shine out for me. Elis big character change was weird.Although I listed what I didnt like about them I still liked them those are simply what made them imperfect for me. But it made it difficult for me to find my favorite. Watching and finishing the nd season only made me love them more.When I started SIF my top  were Honoka Nico and Rin. Kotori was in th place. But when I talked to my friend about Love Live after showing him the entrance to idol hell I learned about his top  with Kotori being . I told him that shes pretty but her voice ruins it. And he told me he loves her nonetheless. Anyway I pulled him into playing SIF by posting Kotoris screenshots. And while doing so I also started loving Kotori.gtWho cares if her voice is high pitched?So she became part of my top  pushing Rin down the list.Later on I saw a vid of Emi Ucchi and Pile role playing a scene with their characters. And the sudden change of Ucchis normal voice to Kotoris voice changed my view. Her high pitched voice which was weird for me suddenly became something I could respect.gtChanging her voice was hard enough. but she even sings with that voice.That sealed Kotori as my best girl.,SchoolIdolFestival,d2zo86d,1,t5_31rt4

No happiness no sadness. Maybe because Im going to school less frequently or something. Maybe because I always writing programs and scripts so I forgot about my normal expression.

This is a bit unfortunate since I have  JP accounts and  EN accounts one of which Ive begun tiering every event on.Since theres no chance this will be changed I can only pray I CAN get Riko from T and that shes not exclusive to T.

7925967,0,t3_4nrz8h,Some people just have that much money. When you have a lot of money and a very specific interest money isnt an issue. How they got the money depends it could be inherited owning something that gives them money or working a job that pays a lot.I am somewhat judgmental about whales. On one hand they are necessary in order to keep the game going Ive been somewhat of a semiwhale in games that I really enjoyed but only after I had already achieved everything. On the other hand I feel that they are often unskilled. A lot of people that had skill start putting in money and getting benefits then start relying more and more on the benefits which causes their skill to go down due to the fact that they start relying on the money to carry them and allow their skills to rust. What I do respect are the ones that spend money but dont use it to gain an actual advantage. Cosmetic types as an example.I used to play competitively against whales and many have learned that it just isnt worth it to compete with me using money. One guy spent  USD running from me failed. One guy spent  USD in a week to keep up with me. Another guy spent well over . USD per week to stay slightly ahead of me.Ive had people that just have so much money from their jobs that they dont really feel like putting in effort. Ive had a few people that had a lot of skill and used money to push themselves just a bit further. One way or another generally whales have a source of income that is significant.Though it is a mystery to me how someone has a job that gives them over . USD in a single year... and decides to spend that on a mobile game.,SchoolIdolFestival,d46ycfi,3,t5_31rt4

Most of ppl forget that just bc youre not tiering all the time for events or not playing every moment of every day efficiently doesnt mean you cant be apart of the love live fandom and just enjoy the game as a casual pass time when you have nothing else to do  ,SchoolIdolFestival,d4h2wp3,7,t5_31rt4

8033985,0,t3_4p99kw,Here is a brief summary of the new stuff mentioned in the notice for the . update at least from what I can gatherSpecial Practice You may now idolize cards using seals. Idolizing higher rarity cards require more seals. In line with no.  sellingpracticing idolized cards will now only give  seal instead of . Based on the image it seems like those are the number of seals needed to idolize a UR. To idolize a UR you need either  R seals  SR seals  SSR seals or  UR seal I might be wrong though.School Idol Skills By idolizing cards you get to increase the number of skill slots in a card. Idolizing for the first time increases the cards skill slots by . For already idolized cards doing a special practice with another copy of the card increases your skill slots by  while doing a special practice using seals increases it by . The table gives an overview of the initial and maximum number of skill slots for each rarity. The ones with   means promo. Skills consume certain number of skill slots . The stronger the skill the more slots it consumes. Skills are essentially like power ups that you can attach to cards. You can get skills through the present box  box. Every time you clear a live show a gauge gets filled up. Once the gauge is full you unlock a new skill and you also get some items. Present boxes also have ranks and the higher the rank the better the items you get. The higher the rank of the present box the more points you will need to fully charge the gauge.So far these are what I was able to gather. Im pretty sure I missed something so feel free to add more. Edit This is the first half of their teaser. They will also be releasing a second half sometime soon maybe a week before the update?Edit  Added an important detail about increasing skill slots.,SchoolIdolFestival,d4j3gj3,124,t5_31rt4

8063172,0,t3_4plmxk,I believe Klabs recent decisions have been influenced by profit to at least a certain degree. Its obvious Klab is trying to rush the EN server to match the Aqours hype. I agree that the scouting boxes became a mess once both halves of the set were combined. The rates should be increased or the set should be split in two. My suggestion for the dual events is to have them run at the same time. I have no idea how feasible this is but this means fans of two girls dont have to compete with each other. However this does become a problem for people that want to tier for both girls so this solution is also problematic. I also play Bleach Brave Souls another game by Klab that is also high in RNG. There was a recent incident in the Bleach game that got a ton of backlash from the community. A Beginner Mission was released that was only made available to players after the game updated. The reward for completing the missions was the choice to select a  character from a pool. Pulling a  isnt as absurd as pulling an UR since the Gatcha rate is at  and  for new Gatchas but most fp players have difficulty obtaining them. It was a horrible decision by Klab that divided the player base. The subreddit for Brave Souls decided to do a mass mailing campaign to inform Klab of their discontent. The majority of the emails were polite and Klab did eventually respond. Fortunately all players will be receiving the beginners mission on the th. This shows that Klab does care about its player base at least for BleachBrave Souls. I know the two are different games run by different people but the same tactic may work for SIF since they are both owned by Klab. ,SchoolIdolFestival,d4mdk9o,6,t5_31rt4
8071871,0,t3_4prpgp,Well the main reason is probably stress and pressure.

I discovered this game through a video clip of a man dressed in Nico cosplay saying Nico Nico Nii odd I know. A few of my friends on IG at the time were playing it as well so I decided to give it a shot. I chose Nico as my starter and shes been my best girl ever since.     Honestly though these girls keep me into the game. Ive tried other idol games but none have appealed to me. None of them are Muse or Aquors! I am very emotionally invested in each of the characters especially our children from muse. I legitimately cant listen to any of the slower or more sad songs without tearing up. I dont know Im sure its unhealthy to be so invested in them but.. Theyre special! Thank you for this giveaway.

Actually I think KLabs intention was to have  trio boosts per center skill which would completely cover the spectrum of possibilities. There are  different trios for smile angels  for the cool empresses  for the pure princesses etc. That idea doesnt completely make sense though. They ended up with duplicates like two different BiBi pure empresses leaving no room for a Printemps one...Anyway here are the  onattribute cards with a trio boost.

Are there any benefits to saving Scout Tickets ? All I know about is the  events. But I also read something about rates being changed in . or something ? Which I would assume would apply to tickets.. At Level  as a free player is it worth using Love Tokens to reach tier  in events or is it generally better to just save up  tokens and hope for URs ?. When going into the special practice menu some members that I already have idolized have the option to be idolized using an already idolizedmax lvlBond member but In what seems to be the same exact scenario sometimes it just says the newer member cant be idolized ? this sort of happens with leveling as well where it will let me open the menu to level a member that is already max level while other max level members are grayed out.. Thumbs or Fingers ? Im really struggling to move my thumbs fast enough when notes go from top to bottom to quickly and was wondering If Ill just get used to it at some point or If I should just try playing with the phone laying flat on a table. I really wanted to try doing Expert medleys but failed on the first song both times  I feel like this was just me being unable to read the notes though. ,SchoolIdolFestival,d5vkld1,1,t5_31rt4

8619226,0,t1_d6i57fd,The exploit would be difficult to fix completely without completely rewriting the clientserver interaction. The hard part is that the client can be disassembled and whatever method they use to authenticate a real client can be replayed by a fake client.gt Client requests with a body and server responses contain an HTTP header XMessageCode which is an HMACSHA computed over the requestresponse body. This would have stopped rdparty clients like this one except the HMAC key can be found with a bit of patience by disassembling the game clients NDK binary.Not that its easy to disassemble an executable and find a key but it is possible. Once the key is out there thats it. You sign your own network requests and report whatever you want to the server. I suspect the server is a little too trusting of the client and doesnt do sufficient checks for reasonable modifications a lot of the checks might be clientside which is why a groundup rearchitecture would be necessary to really fix it. The next best thing is to play a game of whackamole and just ban offending accounts though since theres no way of stopping a new one from popping up thats pretty useless.,SchoolIdolFestival,d6j04j1,1,t5_31rt4

8626581,0,t1_d6jvsje,The point to max leveling them is for the album completion rewards  love gem for every  unique cards max leveled. For leveling up skills this depends a lot on whether you are on JP or EN. On EN you need to use a card with the same skill name and if they have the same skill level practicing one card into the other will guarantee that the skill level goes up by one. You can also use a support card Yazawa sibling classmate and mom cards with the same attribute and rarity and skill level. If the skill level that you want to raise is higher than the one you are practicing in to it it has a chance to work but it isnt guaranteed. On JP the skill name still needs to match or you need a support card of the same attribute but not rarity. There is a separate XP bar for skill xp that gets filled up when you practice matching cards into it. ,SchoolIdolFestival,d6jxchj,1,t5_31rt4

Rooting around in the source file doesnt bother me too much either though I would definitely need help my experience with coding is amateur at best. Im pretty much at a loss for running a server though. I feel like I could get my laptop to support it hopefully but I dont even know where to begin on how to learn this.If I give up on the devices being linked for a score match however can I alter the source code of the game to essentially break it open?  unlock all songs lp unlock stock cards? Maybe even set up a fake medley festival with preset songs? Personally I love the medley festivals and a competition ran with three songs medley style sound great to me but without a medley fes theres no reasonable way to keep track of combo breaks. This is all hypothetical though. Like I said Im no code monkey. But it seems to me the game data already stores most the songs and cards so it should be theoretically possibly to unlock those somehow right? Keeping it off the server of course though.,SchoolIdolFestival,d757j95,1,t5_31rt4

Ulitmate MedfesScorematchChafesToken Bloodbath that took place in the year  I decided to go back in time to train all players so that they can face such destructive events. If you wonder what happened to all players in the future and also wonder why now robots play SIF the story goes as belowFebA new event system was released known as Ultimate Event . It basically fuses all past event types into one huge event that went on for minimum  days  maximum  year. Many players suffered from twitching broken wrists and seizures while others had passed away trying to get their UmiMakiHonkKotoNicoRinPanaNozoEli URs.AprilKLab replaced all remaining players with high tech robots that were able to play flawlessly to prevent their server from failing.JanPlayers that were removed from the game finally decided to Hack KLabs system and hence created a secret group Human Agency of KLab Hackers a.k.a. H.A.K.H. pronounced HACK.MarchThe group unfortunately failed their mission after  years of fighting bravely.SeptA new event was released an Aquors x us crossover. None of the robots were able to survive except me. I kept playing continuously even though my system couldnt take it anymore. After the end of this event KLab finally decided to shut down their last remaining server. And hence Im trying to save this game so that the next generation of players can enjoy SIF just like how past players did. not to mention that I wish for them to suffer from idol hell as well. Currently Ive trained over  players and I need more starter accounts to be able to distribute among all trainees.Thank you so much to anyone who reads this absolutely no way that this will ever happen story! lt,SchoolIdolFestival,d7p08ar,1,t5_31rt4

The magician set unidolized came close but I want to see real tuxedos like they wore in Love Wing Bell.Finally I dont know what the set would be exactly but I really hope the next NozomiRin UR pair is something more playful  theyre the ultimate bros imo and I really want to see them in a more dynamic scene than just making Valentines chocolates. Perhaps for the NozoRin pair a tropical set would be fun! Something inspired by Hawaiian luau style or something similar to the Explorer Umi event card? Unidolized they could maybe be tourists EDIT I forgot about my Marionette set idea! I had the idea where the unidolized could be the girls with simple hand or finger puppets of themselves or something related to them maybe little birb puppets for Kotori?. The idolized would be the girls in marionette strings and outfits with the joints painted on their elbows and knees. UR pair could be Nozomi and Honoka the puppet masters of muse and could be holding the marionette crosses like theyre controlling the SR girls.,SchoolIdolFestival,d7wycdg,1,t5_31rt4

9118008,0,t1_d87t6t0,gt Is it just me or are Aquors songs just a bit harder? I never had this much difficulty in any of the s songs even sightreading them for the first time Id occasionally FC in one shot. But Im having a lot of trouble maintaining combos with the Aquors songs.I feel like they are! A lot of them are fastpaced notedense songs and feel very similar to Yume no Tobira and Loveless World in difficulty level to me. I think its more than just the Aqours songs though. KLab really started bringing the difficulty up around this time period but since WW is behind in s songs it feels like this Aqours difficulty jump came out of nowhere. Once we start getting things like Super LOVESuper LIVE! EX youll start seeing more songs parallel the Aqours ones in difficulty.gtOn a somewhat unrelated note did old SRs get a pretty sizeable buff? I thought idolized SRs topped off around the high s in their primary attribute? They seem to be hovering around the high s now.Kind of! Bond points are now included in cards main stat instead of being an invisible boost like it was before! This also affects the rest of the cards too. Youll probably see idolized URs that have main stats in the s now.This is mostly cosmetic but one subtle effect is that onattribute center boosts now affect the bond points too.,SchoolIdolFestival,d87u4wv,4,t5_31rt4

9143686,0,t1_d8aynel,Ha I see. No need to feel bad about it the game indeed has mechanics that kind of panelize lowlevel players. But on the other hand it also means that leveling up is pretty rewarding and fun. As long as the cutoff doesnt rise dramatically in the near future you will be able to T without spending gems before long not to say that the tier might get expansion  As soon as you can reliably finish EX songs and not feeling uncomfortable playing them go for EX. Even Score C with th place is better than  per HARD.Now given the  average on HARD you will end up  which most likely will be a few gems away. You can wait for a more accurate cutoff prediction and then make your decision. If its just  pts behind as you were before then getting T with  gems is a very good deal.,SchoolIdolFestival,d8b106s,2,t5_31rt4
9151145,0,t1_d8bykuu,Of course! Its much slower think hours and a little less efficient but you can definitely tier on Hard. If you do though make sure you spread out your gem usage! Unfortunately events now someone correct me if Im wrong though please favor EX players so if you can Id suggest trying to get some practice in on friendly EX songs Aishiteru Banzai Moshimo Kara Kitto etc..You could also try playing EX with the speed set to Hard so that the notes come in a little slower?

I understand completely thank you for your advice! As for your second paragraph Im actually not too sure... you see when we had organized the first project we had three people me and two other people be basically the organizers. But then one person left me while the other stayed and helped though less as time passed. What I really want though if it happens again is for the organizing to be split up to everyone. Everyone is on equivalent terms and everyone communicates often to discuss the idea. In our first project I felt like all the weight was put on my and the other organizer and it just wasnt for everyone to share the work as selfish as it seems. If we ever do create the project again I wont be the one organizing it we all will take part in the effort... ,SchoolIdolFestival,d96fx2j,1,t5_31rt4

This holds the best long term power but will take a long time to happen and isnt really worth if it doesnt fit the two desirable traits I saidIf not you can idolize it normally once or twice depending on taste skilling up isnt really something you want to do if its not a scorer but you can do it anyway if you just want a seal instead of  copies or an extra copyor if youre an absolute madman like me and hate the card you can just sell them all,SchoolIdolFestival,d9dtubs,2,t5_31rt4

Ive always had a problem with tracking fast moving things with my eyes and Natsuiro is proving that SIF is reaching that limit...

You can get full combo and would still get hit with a  deduction and people with less than  combo can still get first with  points.For winning and losing point sure theyre parts of the game but losing  points because of matching is frustrating.

Ended up idolizing Yukata Dia with thanks to the silver seals DFor me the points need to be adjusted for this new system to be feasible. Going from T to TT just because of one or two matches where you get unfairly matched is just ridiculous. System assumes that you dont belong in your current MMR if you FC and still lose so you get minus points but more often than not its the ones who won the match that dont belong that low and just ended up there for one or  games after getting knocked back.

9652444,0,t1_da2uctg,Yep there are advantages to tiering all over the place! When youre at a low rank you do only have short breaks before your LP bar becomes full but you rank up a lot which helps cut down on your gem usage besides which you probably still have a lot of songs and cards to get gems from. Once youre at rank  the rate at which you rank up drops drastically and your love gem gain also slows down but at that point youre also using less gems to tier. Tokens are the best for new players since the only song you need to do well in is the event song otherwise it doesnt even matter if you cant keep a combo on other songs while youre grinding tokens.

It makes sense to avoid including it as its more variable than the fixed level boost but its not apparent at a glance.For instance heres another promo cards page which lists Eli with a very paltry  cool. However heres how mine actually compares Shes exactly  points higher than the listing one for each bond point she has.On my Eli screenshot you can also see the other big advantage that promo cards have on my Elis page a level  skill! Since she has total charm the same skill as several rare cards also have its much easier to raise her skill level up! Thats something thats very hard to with nonpromo cards. Eli still cant outcompete an idolized SR with a full set of SIS slots but it does a lot to keep her viable! Hanayo will benefit from this same thing too,SchoolIdolFestival,da3kgcq,13,t5_31rt4

9989905,0,t1_db9nmlq,Looks like you got solid answers for your other questions so Ill throw in my two cents about the N cards. As a completionist I recommend maxleveling your N cards. You get so many of them its fairly easy to max them out as you go. Just get used to filtering your card views and knowing which icons represent cards that are idolized with max bond and those which are copies of cards already idolized withwithout max bond. Once you get a good system in place you can level up the N cards quite quickly. Id also recommend only using cards above level  to sacrifice during practice. Sell off the level  N cards for credits. I think maxleveling N cards while early in the game is a good idea and doesnt take a lot of effort or time which saves you going back to do it later and having to get all those cards again. And Im probably in the minority but I think its a good investment to spend a few loveca on extra card slots. It makes managing cards so much easier. ,SchoolIdolFestival,db9pnfc,2,t5_31rt4
9997737,0,t3_5ishdp,I kind of did things backwards in that I saved everything for scouting in the beginning and only got the event base cards.

Players would still need to scout for certain URs in the boxes they actually want.  It would take a while to get  R seals anyway unless youre a whale.Plus when I thought of this mechanic I was thinking only of letting players exchange for seals  level above or below the seals theyre exchanging i.e. you can only exchange R seals for SR seals,SchoolIdolFestival,dbwy6jz,4,t5_31rt4

10243244,0,t3_5mn9wt,We have two events based on scoring ability Score Match and Token events though much more the former than the latter an event based on combo ability Medley Festival and an event based on song difficulty Challenge Festival.Id like to see an event based off of Team Composition. In all of the existing events it really does not matter what your team looks like so long as it is as strong as you can make it. What Id like is an event where there are benefits to creating teams around a certain theme. We have  team slots and in any given existing event we only use  of them and all  of them are almost always monoattribute so I think we could do something there.Alternatively an event where the game picks a song and matching team for you randomly would be amusing. Like if it randomly picked Love Marginal it would then randomly pick a team of  consisting of Smile Honoka Kotori and Hanayo from your member list and you play with that team. And since team strength can be wildly variable event points should only be based off of difficulty and combo and maybe remaining HP or number of Perfects?. If you dont have the cards it can use R fillers EDIT Alternatively fill it with your friend centers. . Itd be fun for me at least since I have something cards and only ever use  of them  if you count Aqours.,SchoolIdolFestival,dc54n0a,6,t5_31rt4

10771773,0,t1_ddqzk4y,It does depend on where your priorities lie album completion versus strong teams and both are valid ways to play the game! Ive recently been selling my nonscorer SRs to idolize my stronger cards but I also know people who would idolize cards for the album nevermind if its a timerbased healer of their worst girl or whatever. There are also those who solely idolize by copy and will use the seals for other things BTs etc. I just gave my two cents on what I believe to be the best method to use a duplicate UR for myself but if youre an album completionist I could argue that just the skill up  using the sticker for idolization or saving the sticker for future URs in the sticker shopidolizing a different card could work as well.,SchoolIdolFestival,ddr120m,2,t5_31rt4

For the SSR I see many people saying it will be NozoEli but they have a UR pair from the birthstone set. Rin has an UR last set but is is possible a girl can have UR from a set and SSR from next set or the reverse like Mari.

10904601,0,t3_5vp0m3,Yknow what is kinda cool is that theres really only a small subset of songs being frequently brought up in these posts. That suggests that most of the songs in the game are starred reasonably  its just a small group of them that stick out.I second the comments on the EXs of Angelic Angel Magnetic Today and Datte Datte being harder than their ratings would suggest and the Aqours songs just being harder in general.Also on Hard difficulty Wild Stars  stars is a notable one as some people have said they find it harder than the EX  stars version. I dont find it harder myself but Im not sure theres  stars worth of difference between them either. And Natsu Owaranaide is the only  star song in the game that I still havent FCed yet despite about  or  attempts so far.

11043394,0,t3_5xnhe8,Id like to enter for the  UR semi. I currently dont have a main on JP and my EN main is muse only so Id love to have an aqours based main to play on JP. I love this game and really want an opportunity to tier both EN and JP events. This account would be perfect for me to start playing seriously on JP. I absolutely love the new Aqours URs but in the spirit of keeping my EN main muse only and being mostly fp I havent been able to scout any. If Im able to have this account I would use it as my permanent JP main and I plan to tier  every event like I do on EN. ,SchoolIdolFestival,dejqzkw,1,t5_31rt4

11080559,0,t1_densqjj,What version of Android?If . or greater does the lock screen say Charging Slowly Charging or Charging Rapidly? If youre charging from a laptop instead of from the wall it wont charge as fast. Ideally youd have a good wall charger that would show as Charging Rapidly and if its only showing Charging you either have a phone that doesnt support fast charging or you can upgrade your charger to one that supports it.If youre plugged in and the phone says it isnt charging or if it flickers in and out of charging its likely a problem with your charging cable but it could also be dirtdamage inside your phones charge port.Settings gt Battery will tell you whats using up your battery. For me the Screen is usually the  offender and you can turn down the brightness on your phone to improve it a little. Make sure you dont have any apps consuming an abnormally large amount of battery life. Also from that menu you can activate Battery Saver and see if that helps.,SchoolIdolFestival,denyzcq,3,t5_31rt4

11124834,0,t3_5ypy6u,I have been playing since the Ghost Nozomi event as well! I loved that card as soon as I saw it and I remember staying up all night just to play through even though I was new. I got busy though taking care of a little cousin  she was only  months wow!  and ended up losing my account after breaking my little tiny iphone s. ? I had tried to get the account back however the code had expired and I found out that since then Ive been jumping from account to account never satisfied with either my luck or the something or other. I love to also start accounts from the floor up and see what happens to them over time as I play them. Ive also had my ups and downs recently with buying Itunes cards from Japan and with that struggle with being sick I just put down LLSIF for two months im back though still kicking still rolling. I think I mightve saw an ad for LOVE LIVE though because to this day I have never watched the anime  At the time I didnt know there was one!  I really should watch it though!! and I will probably since Im about ready to settle down with an EN and JP account soon and want the experience of watching the episodes and reading through main story as I do it too.   This game is both a blessing and a curse though  getting into other idol games and further into idol hell the more i take one step further haha ex. Ichu Idolish Boykira IdolMster Ensemble Stars Yumeiro Cast and Bandyaro all eat space on my phone rip.  but I love it nonetheless.,SchoolIdolFestival,deszo8e,2,t5_31rt4

11227853,0,t3_60a2n9,Just clearing up for anyone who wasnt around at the time the idolised outfits URs too! None were picked though were the only ones you could choose and I believe they only allowed older cards into the pool? Probably so that people didnt stop scouting for the cards they want. I have a feeling it was only cards that werent in the main box at that time but I also feel like there was a very small amount of cards to choose from.Some like Constellation Honoka were likely picked due to the pose since everyones in love with prince Honk. Naturally they didnt stick to the same pose but they also didnt stick to the same emotion that the original card displays.Personally the main one I dislike is wedding Rin. I guess people may have voted it due to Love Wing Bell but I really dislike the wedding set especially idolised. I remember not really knowing which Rin to vote for though p The stupid fluffy thing around her neck is so gross.The more I look at these the more I can tell they either drew the poses first before the cards were chosen or copypasted the poses with minor tweaks and its bugging me p likely why they all feel so sameyFor Nozomi its pretty dumb that they put her plait behind her head. Her hair in that card is the main appeal of it!! Ive been blessed with the original card and the way shes holding her hair is the charm point her clothes arent that detailed but its still a dream card for many people due to the hair.,SchoolIdolFestival,df4nuus,18,t5_31rt4

11512328,0,t1_dg0pvp0,Thanks for adding your thoughts to this!gtitd be increasing but in something similar to logscale. so the increase is barely worth mentioning. so itd effectively cap off.Although thats the largest part of our increasing cutoffs during the time the event lasts I suspect that as this logarithmic element trends towards zero the effect of dodging and of failing songs will keep pushing the cutoffs up in the long longterm. Both take away much of that heavy th place hit leading to matchups where the total point gains far outweigh the point losses. The things that push it down involve multiple players failing the same song and multiple players taking a th place timeout penalty which I suspect dont make as big of an impact. Its hard to say though.More generally SIFs ranking system handles things in a way thats fundamentally different from others Ive seen... In chess the player either wins or loses. No one can dodge and save their points. Its a similar story for a lot of the other games Ive seen with ranking systems. If a player leaves quits goes inactive or anything of the sort its treated as a loss no matter the circumstances. SIFs the only game Ive played where this doesnt happen. Whether thats a desirable behavior or not is tricky for SIF... Admittedly I havent played that many games with ranking systems...gt layers wouldnt happen either. because of said cap theres not enough space considering playerbase size. even if there was a little more space unless the players in each of these layers are constantly switching stth someones gonna drop down from the layer and someones gonna rise up from the layer. so these layers cant stay not even mentioning formingEven without a cap I dont see it easily happening it either. Or at least not without more unusual player behavior. Unusuals the wrong word for this but I hope it will do. It gets weird trying to think of how things might look in a year though especially if you try to account for changes to the playerbase...Unusual behavior is usual though... A lot of this idea arose because of the situation with JPs second score match and the players who conspired to raise their rankings. Past a certain point they definitely werent being matched up with any other players but themselves. KLab banned them and removed them from the rankings but in a situation where KLab doesnt do anything I think other players wouldve started doing the same thing. Because the upper limit is basically nonexistent I think players will form into little pockets further up the rankings rather than layers. It would be sad to be the player who did this with  other friends who eventually quit. Endless bot battles until some other pocket of players reaches your rank...gthmm... new players. I think itll cause instability but assuming no one really changes their teams much theyll soon stabilize as well. the players already in the system might shift a little bit up if we assume the new players are weaker but the effects grow smaller the higher up you go Id assumeThats roughly what Im expecting too. When I experimented on JPs first score match if I dipped below a certain point threshold for whatever reason my MMR score would eventually start picking up guaranteed increases again. If theres not a large enough pool of ultraweak players to begin with theyll help buoy up the stronger players as they form a more a larger groups. However the ability to improve your teams plus the loss of old players makes me wonder if this would ever happen. Maybe if the playerbase was far larger...Whats interesting is that JPs much larger playerbase ended up with much more clustered tier cutoffs. I was wondering if the larger differences in tier size on EN were partially a result of a smaller playerbase but I think its more likely that its the result of a modified MMR system. Especially since there was a much larger TT gap on JP last time even if the TT gap was more typical by the end.,SchoolIdolFestival,dg0xa6m,1,t5_31rt4

11606331,0,t1_dgaxgvm,I agree I know that FFRK does something vaugly similar with its orbs material used to make abilities the orbs come in rarities  star and you can trade in any star for any other star as long as theyre the same type attribute in SIF standards the rate to get  five star from all  stars is insane though a  ratio. Ofc the best way to do it is trade  stars for  stars  stars to  stars etc etc. it costs a fair bit of gold I accidentally spent every gold I had in the game today doing the exchange and I had a LOT of gold. So it would solve the SIS problem and the G problem if having too much G could even be a problem,SchoolIdolFestival,dgbl5mc,1,t5_31rt4

11614424,0,t1_dgcbnkb,I think we should also have some kind of compensation.One times was ok but  times really start to be inconvenient they will most likely have to do a huge maintenance just to merge the server and add the new language.And although most TW players wont come to the WW server i think there will still be a good number of them that will come and while it most likely wont be enough to make Klab increase the tier it will be enough to make it harder for a bunch of players to be able to get the tier they were able to get without too much problem before.,SchoolIdolFestival,dgci6u6,11,t5_31rt4

11633604,0,t3_660ees,The thing is you can upgrade the UR skill level with skill cards I get a couple of SR skills just from the reward boxes and  or  in festival events when I dont tier. I look at idolizing by copy like using  UR seal. And I would only practice it as skill fodder if I already had it idolized by seal or copy doesnt matter to idolize another UR,SchoolIdolFestival,dgeojoj,2,t5_31rt4

11642821,0,t3_664vdv,To be entirely honest those fights seemed so ridiculous that I thought they were joking. It took me awhile to realize they were getting into serious fights over stuff to the point of blocking other users. I have a HUGE problem with the Instagram community as is because a lot of them steal art. I dont give a shit if its unintentional you didnt know or I wont do it anymore its stealing and they should remove all uncredited artwork OR give credit. If you didnt know you were breaking a law you dont get away with it youre punished the same way as other people who did know the law. It pisses me off to no end to the point that I guess I overlooked their arguments. They are hurting the Love Live artists and its extremely demoralizing to the point that I REFUSE to post any of my fan art because I know it will go around other platforms uncredited. Dont get me started on the art thieves who claim that the artwork was theirs...anyhow yes the Instagram community is a toxic mess and while there are some good people out there they are drowned by the overwhelming toxicity of the rest. This subreddit is a true idol lovers sanctuary where we can all love our girls in peace.,SchoolIdolFestival,dgfq73m,15,t5_31rt4
11643772,0,t1_dgftn4p,Seal idolize with UR seals is not really worth also Maki is your second best girl so dont do that. That card is also a really strong scorer and would make your smile team much stronger. Its usually the best to idolize with SSRs seals. Use this Maki to make your smile team stronger to achieve T for score ranking to get those SSRs seals and then idolize her. Its much easier to get  SSRs than UR of top  girls and on top of that a good scorer card.,SchoolIdolFestival,dgfu2sb,2,t5_31rt4

11675598,0,t1_dgjfggi,Just to reiterate did you skill her up or just idolize her? Either way what I think happened is what I mentioned before there are two configurations that are very close in their strength. If you idolized Kotori she gained  levels and since Kotori is at heart a pure girl and thus has a relatively high pure stat even on nonpure cards the Coptori  of pure converts to cool  nd year boost suddenly became juuuuuust a little better than the  boosts.,SchoolIdolFestival,dgjg1lx,1,t5_31rt4
