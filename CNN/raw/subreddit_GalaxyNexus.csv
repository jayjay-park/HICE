96760,0,t1_cepfvom,because the PAGapps had the full camerai like doing photospheres and everything has been working better since flashing those.  I started with the original CM Gapps and got a bunch of force stops and applications failing and noticed the camera wasnt fully featured so I found users having luck with using the PA gapps and I had the same luck however there is this one issue Im running into now.,GalaxyNexus,cepg28h,1,t5_2sypj

107793,0,t3_1vap3m,Ive flashed lots of kit kat on mine so far. Make sure youre using the latest recovery that caused some issues for me when I was first trying to get it going. I didnt like CM I had issues with SMS. Shiny had terrible battery life. FML was good for me and it was the first one out but now Im on the latest AOKP nightly  GAPPs modular mini  ART. I love AOKP.,GalaxyNexus,ceqpcrv,1,t5_2sypj
149635,0,t1_cevfuz8,The drivers are on my computer at work. Mind if I get them to you tomorrow? If you dont want to wait try searching Google for something along the lines of Samsung galaxy nexus adb drivers  bit. That should return relevant results.I also remember having to install a driver that is in the clockworksmod USB tether pack for Windows. I guess there is the correct driver in there. I think you can simply install it and try adb. If it works you can uninstall the exe and there is an option to leave the driver.,GalaxyNexus,cevh30z,2,t5_2sypj

294093,0,t1_cfb16xk,Thanks. I expected it might take longer than other builds because of the lack of official support but I was hoping things would be a little closer given the demand.,GalaxyNexus,cfb8xwj,1,t5_2sypj

446012,0,t1_cfqzog4,No way to drop Verizon for me.  I have tried Sprint TMobile and ATampT for my work or personal phones in the last few years and none of them other than Verizon has reliable access at my home and work.

602016,0,t3_211810,Nexus  through Straight Talk.  Its been awesome but I never used or do use more than GB of data a month.  I highly recommend it if ATampT has coverage in your area.  Porting was easy and it took only  minutes through their website.  Sure STs customer service blows donkey dick but Ive never needed them.  If you do this just order a SIM from ST order the Nexus  from Google Play.  When you have them both port from VZW through the website.  You pay for your service at this point.  I have auto pay set up so I dont lose service by forgetting to pay.For mo. this cut my cellphone bill less than half with Verizon and the service and call quality has been excellent!,GalaxyNexus,cg8paze,1,t5_2sypj

692793,0,t1_cgiyjxd,Very good.  I just ordered a Nexus  on Amazon.  It was only  shipped.My issues are mostly related to the CDMA radio.  It just stops working which is only resolved by power cycling.  Recently it has been getting really hot which stops when I turn off mobile data.  Luckily my WiFi is working well and I plan on using my GNex as a music server and default Chromecast remote.,GalaxyNexus,cgj0tno,1,t5_2sypj

859664,0,t3_23yfiw, AOKP seems to be causing lots of crashes for a lot of people.  I almost flashed it when I first saw it out there but had to leave for something so I waited.  Thankfully since I would have probably been having to roll back.  ,GalaxyNexus,ch1zyqf,1,t5_2sypj
922695,0,t1_ch95wp0,Hmm. Do you get two options when you hold down the mic? Cause one should be Input Languages and that will take you there. By the way if you have the little globe symbol longpressing that should do the same and open the input method selector.,GalaxyNexus,ch95zg4,1,t5_2sypj
962201,0,t1_ch7g1e8,One of the biggest reasons I have for root is the .thumbnails issue. Mine got up to GB spread across  files in  years. Next thing I did was factory wipe plug in a rom and lock down permissions on .thumbnails to keep my GB to myself,GalaxyNexus,chdntig,1,t5_2sypj

1159198,0,t1_ci00oyp,It will charge for the first  minutes while Navigating in the car dock but then will stop chargingand inspecting the phone at that phone always yields that its very warm.Ive tried Navigation at home while plugged in but the phone is on WiFi and the GPU isnt working because Im not actually moving so it doesnt reproduce the result.I have seen the phone stop charging while in use at home though while doing things like playing games or youtube. However now it appears to using Google Maps and Navigation is so taxing that my phone is getting overly hot and wont charge.,GalaxyNexus,ci010b0,2,t5_2sypj

3361508,0,t1_cpb1opf,No as far as I know from experience. Like I had the Google Camera from the Play Store but it only worked like  of the time. Snapchat no dice. I think the way Android talks to the camera hardware is just pooped out.And of course it is possible to flash back to KK. Just find the ROM you want to use and just install it the way the ROM tells you.,GalaxyNexus,cpbfqmb,1,t5_2sypj
4673217,0,t3_3ev0so,I switched to a sony t ultra first about six months ago. Loved it. Due to issues with the cell antenna and ad card slot I bought a gig ZenFone . The two gigs or random is great the CPU is nice and I have not had problems with battery life.  I liked the feel and screen on the sony better but the extra CPU performance and ram is just really nice. Also the  gigs on board memory is about a baseline imo. The  on the sony made for problems. But I digress. Battrry performance and extra ram are all great. I have issues with the UI and still trying to relearn the keyboard. Also the charger scrapped out almost immediately on me. And it charges on a strange voltage. I have been using an older charger without issue but the manual says to uses the asus charger specifically. So I dont know if I am doing long term damage to my battery. Or not.,GalaxyNexus,ctjlyw9,1,t5_2sypj
