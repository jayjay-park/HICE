2539402,0,t3_2oonnn,Ha. Well if there is an issue speak up. Lots of teams I was on met everyday and it was pointless. We finally said this is worthless and changed our schedule to every other day. Part of becoming a high performance scrum team is doing what works best for the team. Scrum masters and managers should respect that. If a manager wants to know whats going on they can ask the scrum master and no waste everyones time. Thats my  cents. ,scrum,cmq1b0l,5,t5_2qhpq

5379999,0,t3_3onofs,Scrum would suggest a prioritised backlog over a gannt chart. This could be a relatively high level ie the pieces of work being committed to by the sales team as opposed to the individual stories which may make up that. It should be ordered so there is only one  item at each priority. It would include maintenance work and new features. Using a Trello board for this means you have a single list with all the upcoming work in as cards. No two cards can live in the same spot so everyone has to agree on which is the st priority and which is the nd.Dealing with the sales team is another issue. Id suggest setting up the system mentioned above and where delivery dates have been added make sure they are on the cards. If doing it in Trello maybe plan out the coming few sprints as their own lists so people can more easily see what will get done when. Now when a sales guy comes to you with some piece of work theyve said a customer can have you pull up the Trello board and ask them where they would like it fitted in. If they put it ahead of something another person asked for it is on them to get that OKd first. Often you may then find people prioritise a bit more sensibly as they should have an idea of what other priorities there are in the business. If nothing else they then have the responsibility if something important gets delayed as a result. Possibly reinforce this by sending out an email every now and when with how much work has been added and what work has been pushed back as a result. If you are being asked to add more than  weeks worth of work every week maybe youll even get some more resources.Ive seen this or a similar approach work at a few places. All it does is make the backlog more visible and hopefully make everyone take responsibility for scheduling things sensibly. You may need to educate others in the business that you cant just squeeze one extra piece of work into that next sprint etc. but I think in time theyll hopefully get it. Especially if you are more responsive to really important things as a result of all this.If you go the Trello route Ive got some Scrum resources for teams using Trello here ,scrum,cvzcsyu,1,t5_2qhpq

8087604,0,t3_4pzjkp,One of two things is happening. The PO is obstructing progress to the detriment of all involved. Or the PO has a perfectly functional and fit for purpose system that doesnt happen to be scrum and doesnt want that changed.Is the work getting done? Do the staff know what to do at any given time?

8478282,0,t1_d5tnbpa,the user stories should look the same as development stories. you should have clear purpose impact dependencies acceptance criteria etc. all in the ticket. there really should be no difference between how the tickets look. some places i have worked at classify process improvement as technical debt. so it counts towards our arbitrary cutoff of tech debt we can accept per sprint on average. but im not sure this is what youre looking for. Continuous improvement can be handled many ways. for this kind of thing if you dont know where to start youre better off looking at more robust processes than scrumAgile. Look up the toyota production system and see how they handle continuous improvement. you might get some good ideas there. ,scrum,d61bt6u,1,t5_2qhpq

10485662,0,t1_dco0gxr,gtThis is a community about Scrum and Scrum has a value of respect. It therefore seems hypocritical for alleged experts to not show respect towards each other. There is nothing to suggest that because I am a mod I should serve as a punching bag for your insults snide comments or other abuse. So you may want to change your expectations on that front if you dont want to feel disappointed.Doesnt change the fact you are a leader of this community. you should act like it. Yes its my issue because I hold you to a higher standard. but i think youd be hard pressed to say Ive been as abusive as you claim. I also refuse to lower my standards just because you dont meet them. this community wont get better if we dont actively try to be better. You havent been reading my posts. are you really surprised I have become increasingly hostile as the conversation goes on? gtStrong choice of words. When you see two statements that you interpret as contradictory its always worth stopping to wonder if it is perhaps your interpretation that is flawed perhaps due to cognitive dissonance.Except thats not whats happening here. It only explains one of the two contradictory statements. Your example is from the wrong perspective. Its the wrong scale. and it doesnt apply to the real world. Only explained one of the two statements you havent tied your explanation into how this situation can exist and you can learn a lot. Youve pointed out that steak and lobster are fundamentally different and you cant do an exact copy paste but you didnt reconcile the fact that you also said theres a lot we can learn. I stick by my choice of words because you still havent explained anything. almost all of your explanations only consider part of the problem or consider the problem in a vacuum and ignores the place it has in the larger system. Wrong perspective Im talking about training the people who do the coaching and the training. Youre implying that restaurant two is not doing well because it is new.  but new restaurants open and dont have this problem. IE restaurant two isnt failing because they havent had time to figure it out yet. its because they entered business when they werent prepared. Wrong scale Youre comparing restaurants to industries it doesnt work like this. when a new industry is created people from other industries will follow. IE people from industry  will work at industry . maybe they are burnt out and want an easier job. Im in that boat software is way easier than manufacturing maybe they just want a change in routine. but either way industry  doesnt exist in a vacuum there is a pool of shared resources between them. it doesnt apply to the real world Lets consider Toyota. Big company many plants all over the world. There is a greater difference between building a Yaris and a Tundra than steak and lobster. Just considering the cultural and technological differences between the plants in SEA and the US is daunting. each of these plants is independently run. However Toyota spends enormous amounts of time training their leaders. This is how they are able to maintain high quality region to region and year to year. At the same time the next biggest automotive manufactures struggle just to maintain profitability let alone consistency. In addition to this you likely cant copy exact even if they were both steak restaurants. I know for a fact that the processes for the Camry in Malaysia are different than the ones in the US. Your example just doesnt apply to the real world. I understand what youre trying to say but its just not true. I remember being where you are. I didnt get it either. Luckily I had a dedicated and tenacious sensei and eventually learned these values and concepts and how to translate and apply them to software. gtCognitive dissonance again Again I disagree. I dont know what youre comparing. But What i think youre trying to say is that there are more known knowns in manufacturing and less unknown unknowns. And I agree in a sense with half of this. Theres a lot more you need to know and consider to manufacture. simply put logistics and supply chain is something we dont need to worry about in software. This adds a whole  bunch more known knowns and unknown unknowns. At the same time the Cynefin framework is not a goodrobust framework. saying you have more known knowns doesnt really make a space simpler. its counter intuitive something that requires you to know more things than something else is more complex. the only thing youre really saying is it has a higher score on a completely arbitrary scale. Which... Ok. Fine. I dont care enough about this part to continue discussing it. sure. Manufacturing scores higher in simple for Cynefin. but it also scores higher in complex chaos and complicated. in anycase what i think you really meant to say was we understand manufacturing better than software development. This statement I agree with.  gtIf indeed Toyota build each and every vehicle an empirical way then it is reasonable to expect that there is observable difference in each vehicle that they assemble some of which will be significant because they will all have been built differently. They do. Almost everything in manufacturing is done empirically. Observable differences exist in the kanban. the kanban contains the full history of the build. some of them are significant. although i guess it depends on what your definition of different is. When working the line a tech might call an engineer over if they are having difficulty troubleshooting something. the engineer will pull the kanban to see what has been done to the machine. they may then go talk to a tech at a previous station or send it back for rework. depending on what youre building and the fragility of a specific subsystem you may need to rework something multiple times. Youre underestimating the effort and data used to ensure that the end product appears to have little variation. SPC is used to help control the quality of parts processes and products. just because you dont understand doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Looking for large differences in two different camry is like looking for differences in two different instances of a website while hitting refresh. the whole point is to build it so the enduser experience is consistent. all of the variation is invisible to the customer. The only thing thats clear to me right now is you dont know lean as well as you think you do. and wherever you learned it from didnt really get it either. Which is fine. im trying to help close the gap. Im close to giving up cant help people who refuse to be helped. gtThe Socratic method dont work when you attempt to humiliate people when they provide an answer that you dont agree with. I didnt realize you felt humiliated when you couldnt answer my questions. My mistake. Told myself id spend  minutes on this. my times up. I might come back to the second half of this later. but on one of your last points you mention coaching in sports teams. what happens when a team or player suffers a significant loss? almost always they talk about returning to basics or fundamentals. there is a reason for this and im not convinced you understand that reason. Along the same lines you have to remember im talking about training the coaches not the players. theres a significant difference here and none of your examples have touched this yet. rethink your examples from the perspective of teaching teachers and not teachers teaching students. also consider the work needed before someone is fit to participate in a team sport. youve consistently used the wrong perspective and scale. perhaps you should take your own advice and look beyond statements. ,scrum,dcwnqaq,1,t5_2qhpq
11096317,0,t3_5y3cel,I take it you are not doing Continuous Delivery?CD sort of enforces scrummy things like breaking down work and theres a lot of literature on how CD avoids large integration problems.  If youre doing CD you HAVE to break things into smaller pieces to make the integration smooth and meet the regular release train.In my mind Scrum and CD are inextricable partners in software delivery. If youre doing scrum with multiple teams and they dont integrate or deliver working software for months on end youre not really doing Scrum.If CD is not on the roadmap maybe it should be? And not why not? ,scrum,depraka,2,t5_2qhpq

11191545,0,t3_5zh8bz,Understanding agile practices is very useful to a Project Manager although I wouldnt necessarily say you need clear certification in a specific role.  Scrum Master is a project team role which is often seperate from the Project Manager.  They are not managers they are facilitators.But that said if you do want agile certifiation you have three main options. PMIACP would be the most obvious certification to grab as it covers agile projects without defining a single methodology or team role.   to sit for the exam.  Roughly two years of formal experience required.  Estimated requirement of  to attain certificaiton. CSM from ScrumAlliance.org is the most well known Scrum certification.  Expensive around  has a mandatory classroom componant and requires a . to pass the certification exam. PSM I from Scrum.org is less known than CSM only costs  and uses selfstudy.  Requires . to pass the certification exam.CSM and PSM are mostly going to be checkmarks that say I know agile practices and not directly relevant to your career.  However they will help you clear resume screening bots which may be looking for Agile certifications.  If you prefer certifications that will more closely support your career as a PM then uialvarez is correct and a Product Owner certification PSPO CSPO would be more directly useful to you.PMIACP is relevant to both cases but like the PMP requires a sizable chunk of real world experience in addition to subject mastery.,scrum,df0jr4o,2,t5_2qhpq
