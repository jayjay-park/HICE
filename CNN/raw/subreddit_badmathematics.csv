The reason is that in both cases you can just sort of pretend that the population is infinite.Think of it this way. You have two urns. One has  balls in it half red and half blue. The other has   balls in it also half red and half blue.We draw  balls out of each.If what the poster suggested were true the balls coming out of the big urn should vary more while the small urns balls should be closer to .

8239044,0,t1_d57eri7,gtYes but as the post says this applies to all voting rules does it not? If it applies to all voting rules then it has no significance in a theorem thats trying to make out majority rule as being special or different from the others.I have no idea what you are saying. What applies to all voting rules? The example I gave shows how a single person can overrule everyone else. I dont see how that applies to all voting rules.gtNow this is interesting as it relates to what I am currently working through with Condition IV. What you just said directly contradicts what uamdpox and usleepswithcrazy  are saying elsewhere.From what I read in their replies I completely agree with them.gtIm not entirely sure still need to think on it and am interested to hear what others think but you might have just proven the disproof which relies on it being inappropriate for Condition IV to be included in the theorem.You cant prove anything by example so I doubt I proved anything. I merely gave you two examples of voting functions that satisfy condition IV but not conditions II or III which is what you asked for.I have no clue how you infer that Condition IV being included is inappropriate from what has been said. All  conditions have to be satisfied for a voting function to be equivalent to majority vote.Furthermore you agreed somewhere else that the theorem is mathematically correct.

8625893,0,t1_d6jtbk7,I will get to what i mean by free will. I have an idea in my mind of what it is but its hard to put into words so gimme some time. What is your definition of free will? I think its likely that your definition if  you are a compatibalist is different from mine in which case were just talking about different things and whatever im talking about is an illusion but what youre talking about isnt.I didnt say they do i think modern computers dont but future computers might. I dont think theres anything special about stuff developed through natural evolution that would have properties that its impossible to obtain by making it on purpose without using building blocks of whats already been made by evolution. I think the building blocks of the brain and the types of connections it has are not so special that we couldnt recreate it in a machine without biology. At the worst i think if we recreated a brain neuron for neuron with all of the connections it has by hand with something analogous to a neuron and with connections sufficiently analogous to connections in the brain that would have all of the same higher level properties and would count as a machine.This is obviously assuming that theres nothing special about neurons that makes it the only thing that can possibly lead to such things. This is an assumption but i think its a fairly reasonable one sort of analagous to the cosmological princple. And physicalism but i dont think compatibalists disagree with physicalism.And thats leaving behind that we might not even need to do it in the exact same way to get the same higher level phenomena qualia consciousness free will if it exists under whatever definition you think humans have it under. But the brute force method above is a proof of concept that it should be possible.So would such a computer have free will or not under your definition?.

Then I tried weighing the sun by throwing the scale at it but it fell back down. However since the Sun is a giant ball of fire I had the brilliant idea of weighing the sun by setting my scale on fire and checking the reading. I burned myself accidentally but did read that it was zero and anything times zero is zero so the Sun weighs zero. In conclusion the Earth weighs more than the Sun but not by much.,badmathematics,d7uvoyq,38,t5_2wsyp

9504297,0,t1_d9jz0ll,Just wanted to add to a point ucompletelyineffable made.gtMost mathematicians dont care too much about nailing down exactly what strength is needed to ground their work. This is why its so attractive to point to something like ZFC its more than enough and for most areas of mathematics you dont have to worry about needing more.More than this ZFC is the assumed default for pretty much all modern mathematics and it is presumed true enough by most mathematicians. It and the classical framework it lives in are in fact so pervasive that I feel absolutely no moral pangs as stating results of ZFC as de facto truth to nonmathematicians as far as the layman is concerned ZFC is what math is.So when mathematical proofs refer to a set being infinite without qualification it should be assumed that the definition they are using is not finite and again unqualified that all the equivalencies follow finite iff dedekindfinite etc. If you in particular are a constructivist recognize that you are in the minority and that the proofs and statements being made dont refer to the definitions in your framework. Saying this proof is wrong on these grounds would be like a Twilight fan telling someone that Dracula isnt a vampire because he doesnt sparkle both vampires are made up arbitrary notions that exist in completely different realms and yours is the less common interpretation.,badmathematics,d9klv79,5,t5_2wsyp

The ontological argument rests on god being the greatest in all things without being contingent on islandness or purplepigness. The most perfect its talking about is incompatible with being a pig.Thats not to say that because a most perfect purple pig doesnt make much sense a perfect conceivable being must make sense. Some more contemporary relatively speaking criticisms are that some properties of a conceivably maximally great being may be incompatible say omniscience and omnipotence that it requires us to assume a lot about how properties can be greater or worse and that you cant definitely talk about being as a property the same way that purple is a property.,badmathematics,dbpyhf3,6,t5_2wsyp

10364548,0,t1_dciu1sg,univalence can certainly be trusted on these things that we can agree on.  I on the other hand know just enough to be dangerous.gtunless constructivists give up much more than LEM and ACSome do but I think this conversation is about when only those are given up.So again what I know to be the case is that it requires LEM to go from a pair of injections to a bijection.  Im less clear about whats happening with Cantors theorem but I am pretty certain that Ive heard constructivists reject some forms of it so something is going on.That said I am starting to think it depends a lot on the exact statement.  For example you may be correct that we can constructively prove that there exists no bijection A gt PA.  However that may not be enough to prove |A| lt |PA| even if both |A| and |PA| are welldefined and of course without AC that is not a given.I am back to thinking that the issue here has something to do with trying to conclude that there is an injection from R to N.  Cantors theorem states that no set A is equinumerous with its powerset.  In the absence of AC we cannot speak of cardinality so my guess is that equinumerous with is defined as saying there exists injections in both directions.  So my suspicion is that something along these lines is what fails.Edit also this thread has reaffirmed my feeling that I want nothing to do with systems that embrace infinity but reject LEM ultrafinitism I can wrap my head around but infinite without LEM not so much.,badmathematics,dcivtdf,1,t5_2wsyp
