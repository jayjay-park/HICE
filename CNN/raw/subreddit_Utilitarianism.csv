3651230,0,t3_326ffe,Im not sure I fully understand what youre getting at. Are you suggesting that utilitarianism would not advise you to return that found money if you had the option? Maybe a different example would help?gt lets say you stumble across a  dollar bill that someone dropped out of their pocket. If you choose to spend it on yourself then if Im assuming correctly the net utility would be zero as the  from the person losing the money would cancel out the  from finding it.Money does not have the same effect on utility for all people. We dont know in this case if the net utility is positive or negative or zero. Though I suspect net utility would likely be negative due to the endowment effectgt Are there any other examples of common societal occurences that can have a very positive public impactI think the biggest impact can be made by just trying to be a successful person in an advanced society and donating some of that to the most effective charities in the developing world. Its shocking just how welloff we are compared to very many people in poorer parts of the world which presents a big opportunity for impact. But most charitable giving is not given with effectiveness toward raising utility in mind which also means that picking the right charity has a very positive impact compared to the average donation. Peter Singers TED talk covers this well.,Utilitarianism,cq8gtno,1,t5_2revn
