1186948,0,t3_24ywam,I would be happy if they at least changed the order of the expansions. Pets and Supernatural are always so late in the game cycle. I do agree that the personality based ones like Generations should be base game content or at least patched in with a different expansion like the basement feature was for Sims . Adding more personality traits or something really simple like that doesnt justify its own expansion.,Sims4Suggestions,ci35fe8,3,t5_2xo97
