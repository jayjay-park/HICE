109203,0,t3_1vbal8,My only worry is Arda is a really uncommon name for it especially in the popular vernacular.  Widening it to ImaginaryTolkien or ImaginaryMiddleEarth would make more sense to me.,ImaginaryNetwork,ceqv5i8,3,t5_2yfuq
112406,0,t1_cer144u,I was actually thinking of changing up the dropdown menu a little maybe getting rid of the very long The Imaginary Network Expanded! and replacing it with two or three categories between Technology and Friends  I want a Meta section for this subreddit a link to the main multireddit rArtistOfTheDay Im contemplating of officially bringing it into the network and then any other meta subreddits we may think of in the future. I would like a section to compile all of the fandom subreddits we are making  rImaginaryWesteros rImaginaryArda Im also in the process of making rImaginaryGallifrey for Doctor Who fans rImaginaryAzeroth for World of Warcraft fans rImaginaryHogwarts for Harry Potter fans rImaginaryRuneterra for League of Legends fans rImaginaryTamriel for Elder Scrolls fans... am I missing anything? The thing that ties them all together is they are the name of the fictional world or in the case of Harry Potter Hogwarts is the name of the school since they are on Earth and rImaginaryEarth would be stupid.I would also like to somehow split up the Landscapes section into two categories one would stay Landscapes but Im thinking the other could be Architecture it would have existing network subreddits like rImaginaryCastles rImaginaryTowers rImaginaryMonuments etc and we already reserved a bunch of others about a month ago we could open up like rImaginaryWalls I actually seeded that one already.So yeah basically thats just some shit Ive been brainstorming about recently.,ImaginaryNetwork,cer8ags,2,t5_2yfuq

2078978,0,t3_2iajnl,I have no problem with Imgur posts personally however I can see it from both sides of the argument on the one hand it would be better for us to gain more subscribers and ultimately increase the amount of activity from subscribers. But it is clear that this would be detrimental to the artists themselves and would draw attention from them which is why we started this right? to show amazing art to the masses and share our favourite artists and in return to boost their own following.However I dont feel I can talk on the point because I never look at the ImaginaryNetwork whilst out and about. I find that loading images takes way too long on the move so I stick to textbased subreddits. ,ImaginaryNetwork,cl430q2,2,t5_2yfuq

2232975,0,t1_clnnmeu,I agree with the mod stuff for sure. My point that I did not make clearly before is to try some gentle education about what we mean by imaginary before we just delete comments. I feel like a fair amount of those comments are honest mistakes that are easy to clear up with the added benefit of also educating other visitors. ,ImaginaryNetwork,clnnxls,2,t5_2yfuq

2665064,0,t1_cn65s6h,We havent really been adding new subreddits lately have we? One thing I noticed is that even though some of our subreddits are slow they are still growing. Take rImaginaryAsylums for exampleNotice the steady growth even though that subreddit gets only sporadically at best. Think about it for a second... simply because it is a part of our network there is a subreddit with almost  users devoted solely to artwork of asylums... and it is growing steadily. It appears that it continues to grow at the same rate no matter how many submissions it gets or lack thereof.Pretty interesting imo.,ImaginaryNetwork,cn6g7b3,2,t5_2yfuq
3023405,0,t1_cob0z6q,I have no objection to a second curator but my thought is that there are a wide array of fandom tabs and like you most people including myself are not familiar with all. So Id really like to get some more Jr Mods for fandom subs. Mods that have interest in the fandom. Maybe its time for another post like this ,ImaginaryNetwork,cobdfsx,2,t5_2yfuq
3045943,0,t1_codphup,Yeah but I also think having a small council of people could be beneficial. While not used a lot if something major were to happen that needed a major decision it would be handled by them. Thats just my opinion though.,ImaginaryNetwork,codpm47,2,t5_2yfuq
3294328,0,t1_cp3rynh,I thought about that but lets be honest. This is a subreddit with .k users and by April Fools this post will be a month old. Sure someone may dig back a month and find this thread and link to it in the comments section but with a good April Fools prank youre only fooled for a few moments anyway. So it doesnt really matter if they talk about it being a prank in the comments section because Im betting that  of our subscribers do not check this subreddit and will still be pranked. The  that do check here can help us plan the prank P,ImaginaryNetwork,cp3s355,2,t5_2yfuq

4708753,0,t1_cto2ip1,I dont have any volunteers for the remaining curator spots. Although I have existing curators who would like to take on more... hmmm... guess they could curate more than one tab. Although still they would only get  votes so what is the advantage for them? and do they need one?I really dont personally care so much about the VOTE weight. I feel like its a nonissue. My only thought is what can the INE do to reward these kinds of superstar posterspromoters? All I have at my disposal is a thank you a title and vote weight,ImaginaryNetwork,cto2rgl,2,t5_2yfuq
