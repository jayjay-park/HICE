686844,0,t3_2216m8,it will probably have come with a special cloth and a woodenplastic stick thing.. clean it every time you play it. use the cloth to gently wipe the insides and around the mouth piece and keyS. this is to remove residue and grime that will build up. some people recommend getting a moisture strip and leaving it inside the case it supposedly absorbs moisture to stop tarnishing. Ive never had one and my flute is fine so thats entirely your callalso when cleaning it dont use any harsh chemicals or polishing substances. you can buy special cleaning liquids if you really want. you can also use rubbing alcohol around the joints if grime builds up ONLY AROUND THE JOINTS. NEVER AROUND THE KEYSsecondly when handlingplaying your flute put it together and take it apart carefully. you should NEVER force it other wise you can end up breaking something.also some people choose to get their flute serviced on a regular basis yearly is a good shout if you dont plan on playing it for a show like every day L. this is mainly to keep the pads in check and just generally keep all the mechanisms in good shapeyou will find that older flutes screws come loose this doesnt apply to you now but might in the future. so i recommend getting some micro screwdrivers you can buy them from any hardware store just to tighten some of the major screws round by the Bb B and G keys.EDIT i forgot you can get pad paper that you use to clean the pads,Flute,cgicgau,3,t5_2s7p8

4438289,0,t3_3bv81p,Sounds like youre conflating tuning pitch and tone timber.If you dont have perfect pitch check the tuning with a tuner or with a drone.Tone is a different matter. Perhaps because of the large difference in the number of openclosed keys nd register C and D tend to sound different in tone. You might want to try st register C and D and then playing the nd register C and D keeping the st register fingering. ,Flute,csq4qfd,3,t5_2s7p8

He instructs that its better to practice standing which I agree with but for goodness sakes its not the end of the world if you cant manage it. Just make sure youre in a comfortable position and able to breathe deeply. PLEASE dont let this issue bother you in any way. Just relax and enjoy the flute you deserve it.,Flute,cz98p1b,2,t5_2s7p8
7631715,0,t3_4jt4r1,Post a video!Heres a nonexhaustive list of things you might be doing wrong youre blowing too hard. Blow softer. Try to decrease the air volume slowly and notice the change in pitch gets flatter and tone. At some point the note will suddenly go down  octave. you learned that as you blow softer and softer the note gets flatter. Instead of blowing harder again another way to control the pitch is to decrease the size of your aperture this will increase the air pressure. By combining blowing softer with decreasing aperture  you can keep air pressure while decreasing the air volume you spend. your air jet angle is too high. Aim lower. An easy way to accomplish that is to roll out the flute. Do it very slowly and listen to how the pitch changes. Then learn how to do it the Right Way aiming the air jet lower or higher without moving rolling the flute in or out.  finally you might be breathing too shallow. There are tons of videos about this. ,Flute,d39onml,2,t5_2s7p8

I apply those pressure points as you mention but I think a big problem is when i hold the flute in playing position the base of my left index finger as well as my right thumb are both slanted and my right pinky and lips can barely hold the flute from rolling.,Flute,d8mbzme,1,t5_2s7p8

Or you can go to G Maj and E Min and go that way.Do that every practice session and you will guaranteed improve but you need to do your long tones too.,Flute,dbpe1rz,2,t5_2s7p8

10455853,0,t1_dct6ly2,Its not likely that its a solid silver instrument. At the VERY most its silver plated and even I doubt that would be the case. The two most common flutes of this style student level out there are nickel with a plate head joint or in rarer case nickel with a silver head joint. This is from all appearances a student instrument because it is closed hole Cfoot unknown brand location of adjustment screws student style of case. The easiest way to test the head joint is to hold it gently by the crown between to fingers and gently flick the bottom of the joint. Silver will have a dull think. Nickel or plated head joints will ring a little bit more. If you really think the head joint is silver look for stamps. Sterling silver will mean youll have a . stamp on it. Brittanica silver will be . stamp. ,Flute,dct9xit,2,t5_2s7p8

11736375,0,t1_dgq7k8o,Always great to hear a story as this one starchild!  It makes me think of potential used where in the past I never wanted to go that route for the unknown.  But if you have a good person what can look it over as with any high value purchase you may get a great deal on something. Im sure there are people out there that do not even know what they have or had and just sell it for a low price to get rid of it.  One never knows.  Being a newer player I struggle with the price point and want to make sure I will continue with it until I wear it our or I die.  So this would be a lifetime purchase for me I hope.  Im willing to go up a bit in price if I can get something that would get me a bit longer then a less expensive model.  Again I know price is not everything.  Im also sure in some situations again with high valued items you also pat a premium for a brand name such a Powell or Haynes when they are more targeted at professional players etc.  Im all about saving money but I do not want to skimp if it makes a difference in quality and durability.  My fear and this comes more from used carsetc. is that when you go to a shop and tell them my budget range they seem to always find things right in that higherend range.  Maybe it is different for flute sales that is where Im ignorant.  It may also depend on the shop in question.I was not even aware of D or D headjoints.  now off to research another thing...,Flute,dgqcj5m,1,t5_2s7p8
11736839,0,t1_dgqd0rh,The flute I play has a Cfoot.  I read somewhere that there are only a handful of pieces that require the low B that you get with a B foot.  When I play a Bfoot flute I find I have a harder time fingering the low C so I prefer the C foot.  Some think that since a B foot flute is longer it makes some other notes easier to play.  So again personal preference.  If I was looking at something new Id order whatever I wanted but I wouldnt let C or B foot sway my decision if I was looking at something really fantastic and used.  But personally I prefer C foot.,Flute,dgqefec,2,t5_2s7p8
