9332904,0,t1_d8yz4ca,I think in the case of most behavior analytic studies prediction and control are inseperable. This is the case because of our emphasis on experimentation. We make predictions about the data based on the independent variables we are controllingmanipulating. In the case of the research by other psychologists developmental work comes to mind for me prediction and control seem to me to be distinctly separate. For example a developmental graduate student at my school is doing research on how religious and spiritual attitudes change across the lifespan. In this case they are correlating selfreported religious attitudes with demographic information e.g. age religion socioeconomic status etc.. Through the use of statistics they may very well be able to predict that a person of suchandsuch demographic probably holds suchandsuch religious attitude. However they have no real control over the independent variables they are measuring they dont have experimental control over the age of their participants. Because they do not have this control they cannot say how religiosity is functionally related to their independent variables. To me this is a case of prediction without control. TLDR  prediction and control are inseparable in experimental work but you can have prediction without control if you arent doing an experiment,TheoreticalIssuesSIG,d8z0i4g,1,t5_3g7sz
9810562,0,t1_damcvaf,The question about lesions of the brain impacting behavior is also interesting. Im not an expert on brain stuff so I cant say quite as much about that. But I imagine its kind of like Benjamins ball example. If you dont have a hand you cant throw a ball. If you dont have a Brocas area you cant speak. The biology is a requirement but that is not the same thing as saying the brain controls behavior.,TheoreticalIssuesSIG,damd1c7,2,t5_3g7sz
10370328,0,t3_5n6vdi,To add more confusion to this functional mess a function is also a word for a mathematical model describing the relation between two variables. Being on the basic experimental side of things thats usually the first meaning of the word that I think of. Although this is a bit different from how people typically use functional as an adjective it adds to how mired we can become when one word is controlled by many different variables. ,TheoreticalIssuesSIG,dcjjehk,2,t5_3g7sz
