688546,0,t1_cgica10,Its more that not everyone likes his particular graphic style. Its nice but not necessarily the type of renderings youd use either professionally or in school.

7905497,0,t3_4nk15u,Theres no such thing as an actual curve in Sketchup.  All curves are made out of edges.  However you can take a picture of it from the right angle import the picture into Sketchup and trace it with your pencil tool.  This is actually the fastest way and it gives you the most control over the final outcome.  ,Sketchup,d44nj3y,2,t5_2s3rz

10403326,0,t3_5oz4rt,Sure there is a nice plugin called Slicer by TIG. You could also do it manually group everything then just draw a rectangle bigger than your whole model and copy it along the Y axis until the whole model is covered by them like this if youre new to SketchUp you can just copy one then type in x to make  copies at once. Then select all the rectangles right click gt Intersect Faces gt With Model. When you delete the rectangles youll be left with your model and section lines,Sketchup,dcna8gz,5,t5_2s3rz

11597133,0,t1_dga53g6,Thanks I really appreciate that. It took along time.I know most firms that use Sketchup also use other programs for their D drawings but I find it easier to keep it all together. Ive been developing the D plans alongside the D model because I cant be bothered to keep switching programs. I think Sketchup is all I need with Kerkythea and Photoshop too.,Sketchup,dgajkpq,2,t5_2s3rz
