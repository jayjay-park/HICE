2054710,0,t3_2hq12j,The Power of Memory and Manipulation in AngloNorman Durham Symeon St. Cuthbert and Durham Cathedral was an English project where the student traveled to Northern England and translated illuminated manuscripts from Latin. She was searching for possible AngloNorman influence in Durham and Durhams religious aspects such as Durham Cathedral and its manuscripts. This project at first seemed too specific it deals with specific facets of English culture that many Americans are unfamiliar with such as Symeon and St. Cuthbert. I thought what made it relevant was the tiein with cultural memory specifically how much AngloNorman culture was erased from the area. The subject of cultural memory is very familiar and its interesting to apply this project to different cultures and see how they are systematically erased too.Battling Traditional Feminine Roles in the st Century was a creative project where the artist created a medieval womans gown out of chain mail and scales. The project is meant to symbolize women as warriors taking typical historical womens fashion and making it out of something typically strong and masculine. The project dealt with the strong gender dichotomy in medieval characters men as gruff soldiers and women as docile queens or peasants. She handmade the chain mail as well as the dragon scales which were handmolded out of clay and embossed with text on the back. The text was various gender stereotypes for women transformed in wording to give them strength for example one said chef playing on the assumption that women are meant to cook.,creativehumanities,cl0zyw5,1,t5_33668

I dont think with a more feminine dress it should portray a lack of strength or power rather that a women can break stereotypes without losing femininity. That is how I would approach it but I do appreciate the way she went about it ,creativehumanities,cl3078k,1,t5_33668
