4587238,0,t1_ct8t4o1,So you stopped watering it altogether a month ago? You cant water plants based on a schedule. You have to instead check the soil on a regular basis and water it when its dry.  The windowsill isnt a bad idea sun always helps bring plants back to a healthy state.  You just have to make sure the plant is acclimated to the sunlight that it receives.  Check the soil if its wet Id pull the plant out and inspect the roots.  If it smells rotten leave it out of the pot for a few days to dry out.  If roots seem healthy Id slowly acclimate it to more sunlight and water when dry.  ,succulents,ct8tilt,2,t5_2smnv

I would suggest you start removing the lower leaves so the trunk can begin to callous. Just a few leaves at a time Starting from the bottom. It will callous where you remove the leaves.  That will make the base heartier to support the top. Use supports until your trunk is thick enought to support. Dont let it get much taller. Keep the top trim until you have a thick enough base.

Chunks of peat should either be sifted out or be ground down into fines. The less sphagnum you use the better off you will be in the long term. Zero sphagnum is ideal although it can necessitate fairly frequent watering. Keep in mind almost every brand of cactus mix also contains sphagnum moss. Dont use coco coir at all  thats way worse than sphagnum.

Very happy to stumble across these two in a rather sorrylooking nursery today and have some questions about their care.Ive been reading that both would rather full sun if possible but Im running out of space on the direct sun side of my garden. Would the elephant bush be OK in a spot in the garden with morning sun only or should I really try and get him a sunnier spot if I can?As for watering I should let the yukka dry out some between waterings but it seems the elephant bush is a surprisingly waterloving succulent happily accepting a good water every few days. Will the current pot be OK for the elephant bush? We dont have any smaller ones lying around but can rehome him in a few weeks if you guys reckon its a good idea. The soil for the yukka is just potting soil but I mixed in some perlite for the elephant bush.Thanks for any and all advice!

I received this plant bareroot from Etsy roughly two months ago. It went into a  terracotta pot with a fastdraining succulent mix Black Gold succulentcactus mix it feels like its half perlite and started growing like crazy after getting some water. You can see in the first photo the marks of where the new growth is a little lower than halfway up the stems.Its been indoors under a k grow light since I got it its winter here in b and the soil dries out completely within  hours of watering it. In the last month or so it stopped its upward growth and started aggressively dropping leaves from the bottom up. The leaf drop became worse when I gave it  days between waterings so Ive been watering it every day.  It gets filtered water. Is the pot too small? Does it need soil that will hold water better? Better nutrients? Different light? Moreless water? Often the soil will be bonedry I use a moisture meter but the pot will still feel moist I try to let the pot dry before adding more water.

6514642,0,t3_44uko6,these things are tough. I had a bunch of of branches of p. afra that my friend gave me earlier this year. It ended up having spider mites so I freaked and tossed all of them in my organic bin. After two weeks I felt bad about tossing them there also I Forgot to put them on the curb so I checked and the plants actually sent out NEW leaves during the  weeks in complete darkness and extreme high temperatures in a plastic bin. So I planted in the ground in my backyard just to see what would happen. The spider mites were surely gone by then. They did great until the frost hit a couple months later and sadly that was the end of their journey. So IME these plants are tough as nails as long as its not frost. Yours look pretty IME.

7048128,0,t3_4c5ra8,Needs less organic soil for better drainage also needs a drink by the look of the wrinkled leaves.  The biggest issue is the severe etiolation from growing in a lack of light.  If you so desire and you can provide better light you can chop the top few inches off let it callous and replant it after a few days.  The lower portion can also continue to put out new growth in fact pups are beginning to form on the lower half already.  If you decide to cut the top off keep it out of direct sun while it roots can take a few weeks.  You can gradually increase the amount of direct sun the bottom half or whole plant if you choose not to cut it gets by an hour or so each day.  If you do too much at once the plants can suffer sunburn ,succulents,d1f9hfj,8,t5_2smnv

It cant control the amount of water it absorbs that if given too much it can die.If its becoming soft and mushy all over might already be too late. Remove from the wet soil and maybe you will be lucky.Use a dry mix with good aeration and very low water retention.

I like to use the Terra cotta azalea pots. They are wide and short. I like their stout shape better than a standard t.c. pot as they dont to over. Having them in pots will allow you to move them to acclimate and give them proper soil. Cactus soil will probably be the best. You could a gritty mix too but I think with the climate of Texas they would prefer something more organic. Maybe take cactus soil and mix in some perlite and some chicken grit or turface to make it gritty while still holding moisture. Find some heavy duty vinyl mesh out screen material. This has a dual use use this at the bottom of your pots so the soil stays in and stretch some over a frame to make some shade for your plants. Then you can fine tune the amount of light your plant is getting. Aloes are very light sensitive but are also adaptable if you do it the right way!,succulents,d5y7oee,4,t5_2smnv

10316824,0,t3_5npd9c,From the U.S. Customs and Border ProtectionPropagative Plant Material PlantsPlant Parts for PlantingMany plants may enter the United States from foreign countries provided they meet certain entry requirements. Entry requirements vary by plant but the following requirements universally apply If you bring back  or fewer articles of admissible plants that have no special restrictions you do not need a permit. Special restrictions may include requirements such as a permit postentry quarantine treatment or ESA or CITES documentation. Plants must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate from the country of origin showing that the plants meet entry requirements for the United States. Plants should be bare rooted no growing media attached to the roots. You should perform a basic visual inspection of plants. Look for insects or sickly looking plant parts. Wrap plants in damp newspaper or similar material to prevent them from drying out. Roots may be secured in a plastic bag.Twelve or fewer plants are inspected by CBP at the first port of entry. Thirteen or more plants will be inspected by APHIS personnel at the nearest Plant Inspection Station. If the inspector finds plant pests that could cause harm to other plants or if the plants do not meet entry requirements they will be refused entry. This means you must forfeit the plants which will either be destroyed or returned to the country of origin.Travelers are advised to consult with their nearest APHIS PPQ Plant Inspection Station to determine the admissibility of propagative plant material including live plants bulbs corms cuttings root crowns seeds etc..You can learn more about admissibility and entry requirements for certain plants by calling Permit Services at   or tollfree at   or by email at Permitsaphis.usda.gov.,succulents,dcdguve,5,t5_2smnv

Since you have a wallmounted setting and Ive never dealt with this setup before how you do this is up to you.

11441532,0,t3_63b0qx,Looks more like edema than sunburn to me. It happens when a plant takes in water faster than it can use it which causes the plant to develop lesions where the leaf cells have expanded. It could be the result of overwatering improper fertilization or high humidity inhibiting the plants ability to transpire excess moisture. Its not contagious or anything but you may want to check that youre not overwatering and make sure the air circulation around the plant is good. Adding a bit more light may help it recover as well though the damaged leaves will stay that way until theyre shed.,succulents,dfsvy0w,5,t5_2smnv

11606358,0,t3_65i04p,I think it needs more light. The one in the middle likes lowlight the other two like lots of light. Since the one on the right has lots of pups just re plant the middle one in its own pot and move the one on the right over a little. The roots look like they need to become more established too so it could be that. Over all not bad looking ,succulents,dgbl9la,1,t5_2smnv

11626366,0,t3_65x10e,If the meristem where the roots come out of is intact then it has a chance of rerooting and surviving. Its hard to tell from the picture but it looks like you have a chance. Yes just stick it into new soil.,succulents,dgduzw9,2,t5_2smnv

11638459,0,t3_662lxt,Yes it should. I have had success propagating both Aloe and Haworthia using this method. Just make sure the end dries and calluses properly plant it and water sparingly.  If the lowest leaves start wrinkling that is good it means the plant is using resources to grow roots. Try tugging very gently on the top in about a month to see if its rooted yet.,succulents,dgf8dn1,3,t5_2smnv

11722266,0,t3_675ct0,Cut its stem above where the rotting begins. Let it sit out for a day so that the end calluses over then stick it in dirt. Then wait to water until roots have had the opportunity to show. Sometimes Ill give mine a very small bit of water as I feel the humidity helps but certainly avoid it sitting in moist soil.,succulents,dgoqz3f,2,t5_2smnv

11799721,0,t1_dgxh98v,Its not about being defensive and Im sorry if it sounded this way. Its just that were human beings we have feelings. We dont know what people are struggling with. I think there are other ways to genuinely help instead of just bringing bad news that everything is going to rot and fail because thats a fact period. Once again I am deeply thankful for all the help I was given and constantly am on this amazing subreddit page. But were not here on a competition to be judged. We just want to have a good time and share our love for plants thats all. I was feeling so happy about this small terrarium when the first flower bloomed that I felt the urge to post this picture here and share my happiness with the community. I wasnt looking for technical advice although Im thankful for them. I just wanted to have a good time and share this moment of joy not really to be told this is all going to fail.
