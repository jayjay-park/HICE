3646890,0,t1_cpzc1fs,I have a question. Im a bit overwhelmed with the choices of towels. I recently purchased your platinum pro kit awesomesauce btw and was wondering which towel do you recommend to use with quick detailer on the paint? I noticed the Eagle blue edgeless tends to streak a little bit. Would a plush dual pile work better or even a waffleweave?,Microfiber,cq7z11y,1,t5_31v5d
