19164,0,t3_1uc8md,Heyo Im planning a hitchhiking adventure out of Chicago this Summer too. Maybe well run into eachother on the road.It might be hard to find some gear on your budget. But you can stalk The Clymb for sweet deals on a good bag and sleeping bag if youre patient.On The Clymb they have new deals every day on different stuff from outdoor companies. If youre really curious you could PM me your email address and I can shoot you an invite.I know in the Camp section there are some decent Alps Engineering and Lafuma bags at about  bucks  tax.The cheaper bags on there right now are smaller probably daypack size. So youd probably want to keep waiting for a sale.EDITIt should be noted that in general especially when it comes to backpacks and sleeping bags what you pay for is what you get. If youre going the cheap route with a sleeping bag youre likely to end up with something larger and heavier Ive got a cheap ass bag they weighs over  pounds and is huge even with a compression sack. You typically have to shell out some big bucks for something light and compact. If you plan on sleeping in the outdoors a lot from here on out its a good investment to spent the big bucks. If you sleep  hours a night that means youll be spending rd of your day every day in your sleeping bag. You might as well pay to make it as good of a rest as possible. The expensive ones typically last a bit longer too.,hitchhiking,cegm5bt,3,t5_2qhwl

2933564,0,t3_2tobnc,I never get to post on reddit so this is my chance because I actually know a lot about this subject. Thisll be a long one.If you already speak Spanish then you can hitch mexicocentralsouth america for years if you want as some people have. It truly is the most wonderful place in the world to hitchhike. Youll get rides from literally everyone in every type of vehicle and frequently the best is in the back of pickup trucks going down the coast. Just sit back and enjoy the most wonderful and beautiful ride of your life. I myself recently hitched from mexico to panama and then back again over the course of  months. It was extremely easy to get around as there arent really any laws against picking people up and Latinos get a kick out of picking up a gringo or whatever you are. They will talk to you and ask you all sorts of questions because theyre genuinely interested. So then some advice  cops in rural areas are your best friend but cops in central mexico in the major cities can be corrupt so just dont do anything stupid. Hitchhiking in and out of major cities can be the worst experience its easy and cheap to use the buses especially when trying to leave a city just take a bus to the next town outside that city and hitch from there so use them. Border crossings are very easy but sometimes cost a few bucks sometimes  but sometimes free. Remember there is no physical road between Panama and Columbia. Food is cheap and good! Plenty of panaderias bakery that sell the cheapest bread a few cents if youre on a pretty much non existant budget like I was. Do however bring some money so that you can eat all the ridiculously delicious food these countries make. You can eat very well for very little money. ALWAYS ask three different people for directions because a Latino will never NOT give you directions even if he doesnt know the way. All these places are safe except for in certain parts of big cities just like any big city. So like anywhere watch your back. It should be easy considering you say you speak the language. As for south america I have met travelers along the way who give even better reports of hitching down there so dont be afraid. Your best resources for some stories would be the online hitching blogs a few people have. If you have any specific questions about central america I can answer them. Otherwise safe travels and remember that mexico is just a cheap flight away. ,hitchhiking,co1k3wc,5,t5_2qhwl

3711365,0,t3_32uovu,When my lil brother and I were hitchiking Europe last winter scotland to Russia stepping across the border bw Poland and Ukraine was a major transition at the medyka foot crossing. It was immediate and obviously a different country with folks everywhere hustling etc like a cold version of india. Some ladies coming back from a polish shopping excursion saw us stopped started talking to us erratically and pushing our sign down. I kept holding the sign back up for lyviv thinking they were just being weird or maybe trying to swindle us or something. They were very insistent and resorted to pulling us with them to a bus stop around the corner. I was all like no no no but they wouldnt leave us alone til we bought a bus ticket which ended up being like a dollar a piece totally worth getting out of the cold for. My Ukraine friend had told me not to hitchhike but he is also post soviet plus mental illness kinda paranoid. Ukraine travel is soooo inexpensive that it is almost silly to hitchhike from a financial standpoint but I know that isnt why we do it. We were also over there when Kiev was on fire so I was fine with not hitchhiking. The Ukraine train from Kiev to Moscow was quite the experience. Have fun!

People just dont talk to each other spontaniously here although that is not say that they arent generous. I remember once coming home from London and having missed my last bus home from the train station. I was at a loss as I didnt know anyone as I had just moved there and had no money for cab fare. So I basically asked some random people on the train having explained my situation the first two people I asked gave me enough for a taxi. The first woman  the second man . Ive found people to be have really high moral standards here and not in a religious way meaning if they found a wallet theyd most likely give it back or if they were presented with a choice of doing something wrong but getting something of benefit for themselves theyd chose to forgo the benefit and instead choose the morally correct option.

5606436,0,t3_3rdq1z,I travel with a laptop phone and numerous other valuables no problems thus far. Sure theft is always a risk... but carrying a laptop in your pack doesnt make you more likely to be the victim of theft so long as people arent aware its in there. Keep it in your pack when its not in use and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS maintain control of your pack. Sit with it shit with it. If you can keep it in your lap when getting rides. People will already assume your pack has some stuff worth taking which is why you best defense is constant vigilance. Treat your pack like a newborn baby. You wouldnt leave a newborn in the ditch by your sign while you cross the street to use the restroom would you? Similarly dont ask someone else to watch your pack while you shop dont leave your pack in the car when you buy munchies while your ride gases up dont leave your pack in a secure hiding spot in the woods while you shop in WalMart etc. An abandoned pack is NEVER secure. Imho and in my experiencethe experience of the hoboscrusty kidstravelers Ive spoken to the chances of someone ripping your pack from your back are pretty slim. Keep it on or at your feet and youll be fine. Dont sweat what you cant control... but do control what you can. Your chances of having your pack ripped from your hands goes up if youre hanging with the wrong crowd so dont. Your chances of losing your pack go WAY up if you leave it in your rides car. So. Dont.  Keep it in your lap so you dont forget it they cant take it and you can bail with it quickly if you need to. ,hitchhiking,cws16jc,1,t5_2qhwl

Decades of research into driver psychology plus data compiled by hitchhiking races and the Russian clubs. Clothes matter. Visibility matters. Facial hair is undesirable because it obscures ones face just like wearing sunglasses or a hat is not advised.gt You can be a mainstream middleclass hitchhiker all you want but why pretend that hitchhiking isnt a counterculture activity? Its inherently counterculture.Of course but most drivers are more likely to accept the hitchhiking if one doesnt add too much other counterculture on top of it. It is best not to look like an anarchist squatter etc. while hitchhiking.gt It goes against the alltoo common obsession with money the culture of consumerism.I dont agree with that at all. Im quite happy being an ordinary middleclass person. While I do move for free while hitchhiking the gear I buy for hitchhiking journeys costs into the thousands of euro and is very much about choosing the right brands I prefer Fjllrven for clothes MSR for camping supplies. And for me and many of my fellow hitchhikers in Eastern Europe hitchhiking was great because travel actually helped us rise out of having little money and allowed us to achieve relative affluence.

9667902,0,t1_da4p0n9,gt A little warning its hard as fuck to get a ride in France.If you think that then you must have very inappropriate dress or grooming andor hitchhiking technique. France is among the easier Western European countries. Furthermore hitchhiking in France is often done from pages which means you can present to an enormous number of cars traveling at low speed where you can even chat with drivers waiting to go through and establish trust so that they will take you. Its common to get a lift within  minutes from arriving at a page and you can go quite a long distance with that lift. gt  Its hard to catch rides in Sweden Ive heard.It depends where. On most major roads no it will be quite easy if you are wellkempt although some people report that their drivers are mostly foreigners and not native Swedes. In rural Sweden you may find yourself waiting a long time but that might have more to do with the lack of cars than peoples unwillingness to take you. For my part I put a lot of effort into maintaining a reassuring appearance when hitchhiking in Sweden and Finland which I do at least a couple of times every year and Ive ended up getting a lot of rides from old ladies.

The topics displayed at the index are really superficial and there is really nothing discussed there that goes deeper into Hitchhiking and that shows a deeper and more complete and accurate understanding of what Hitchhiking means.This is a cheap attempt made by a total rookie to make easy money without providing any information that proves able to alter a persons circumstances in a substantial way when such person decides to adopt Hitchhiking as lifestyle because hitchhiking is a lifestyle or simply decides to give it a try.Dont waste your money on this. Have You ever heard of the saying if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck?  This looks like useless and sounds like useless so probably is useless.People should be able to understand by themselves when they are not in a position to do something or speak about something because otherwise they risk to make themselves ridiculous as they dont know what they are actually talking about or risk to die as they dont know what they are actually doing.Adrianowww.ClaudioAdrianoDobre.com,hitchhiking,df9z2vb,1,t5_2qhwl

It doesnt really satisfy me.This is something Ive always said myself that bad stuff only really happens to people that arent careful and that you could die and be killed just walking to the grocery store so you might as well live a little. Its how Ive justified hitching to other people for so many years and I DO know that Im an extremely cautious person and I handle potentially dangerous situations very well.BUT im still endangering myself greatly. Theres no denying that. Theres only so much one can do to protect themselves in the situation where a man picks you up with the sole intention of putting a gun to your head and raping you. That stuff CAN happen its extremely unlikely but it can. And I cant get the notion out of my head that if I keep playing this game of chance eventually Ill find myself in a similar situation. Its just this seed of doubt that has very slowly been growing over the years and its a mental hurdle I cant get over.,hitchhiking,dgldlc0,1,t5_2qhwl
