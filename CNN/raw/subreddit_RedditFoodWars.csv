5356615,0,t3_3o2lr8,So Ive done all the stuff with my dish its in the oven now but...I went past my time limit.  On account of my peeling and cutting so many vegetables and herbs.  And me cutting my finger on a mandolin.  Oops.I have a question  I cut waaaaay more vegetables than I actually needed.  Could I use my cut vegetables in the next attempt without it going into my time?  Because all that cutting took me probably half of my three hours.  Im not even kidding.On another note Im actually really confident in my dish overall.,RedditFoodWars,cvwd9ni,1,t5_3a7dk
