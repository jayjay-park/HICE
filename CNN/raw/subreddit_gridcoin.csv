3068004,0,t1_cofiikl,from the forumBut anyway I think the main issue is after we started paying the high mags the outstanding owed shot up to k.  GRC has to pay that down to zero and its down to k now so we are making progress you can see the progress in list magnitudecsv.Your cpid looks fine and should be paid as soon as a few more of the cpids in col M are paid that are still higher than yours.  I would guess  hrs or so to receive a Max por block or two.  Definitely keep it running.So I think this mightr be the issue that you are not being payed often at the moment. ,gridcoin,cofztwa,1,t5_2zk7j
4148266,0,t3_388dfo,how long has it been?  it takes  days to connect your cpid to your wallet.  based on what youve posted assuming you have GRC and your wallet is unlockedunencrypted then you just need to be patient.,gridcoin,crt48kp,1,t5_2zk7j

5052074,0,t1_cuurnbm,You are correct. The maximum block subsidy only restricts how much a single block have hold in PoR rewards.Your RSAResearch Savings AllowanceI think account is what determines what you are owed.If you type list rsa into the debug console youll see it looks back  days and gives you an average if what youve been paid and what it think you are owed based on your mag and the GRC mag unit.,gridcoin,cuuysvn,1,t5_2zk7j
5586701,0,t1_cwpkcw0,From this post  I take it Id need a few thousand to ever get paid and k for weekly. Magnitude is around  but climbing as I tweak projects. Still new to this but no payout in two weeks is discouraging. Im going to research either way but would be nice to have some grc coming in for it.Im not aware of a faucet that would get me even near k grc the economics of it wouldnt make sense.,gridcoin,cwpkz4a,1,t5_2zk7j

5775750,0,t3_3u8hqi, to get paid weekly at the current exchange rate  thats the proportional quantity of coins to secure the network at the rate of once per week.The payout window is currently  months  so any work you do today you have until  months from now to be paid for it. So you dont need to be staking once per week but its difficult to wait months to stake. If youre not wanting to secure the network you can earn via the pool currently in beta you can find it on the cryptocointalk forums.,gridcoin,cxd1atd,1,t5_2zk7j

7178448,0,t1_d1sxrl4,I was actually going to make a thread about this but I forgot.Basically I have not found a way to make the wallet run successfully in Debian and I dont remember how I managed to get it working the first time.  In the end I just made a Mint virtual machine since you dont need the wallet running in the same environment as BOINC is running in.  For Mint and Ubuntu the wallet in the repositories works.  You can sort of use Wine but it throws some weird errors.  I think that the problem it has with Debian has something to do with the default QT and Python libraries in the Debian repository being incompatible with the way that the wallet was written at least going by the error messages I was getting in the terminal.  My overall experience has been pretty decent.  I like it compared to other currencies because you have a lot more control over how much you can make since there are many different projects to pick from.  I make maybe   a week running the client on all of my various spare computers.,gridcoin,d1u4i0j,2,t5_2zk7j

7445587,0,t1_d2oh041,Thanks im reading up on any material i can find to better understand payments. If i understand corectly there are  blocks per day you can participate in payment share by staking balance. The amount of GRC you get each stake must be linked to boinc research done. So more GRC in stake more often you get small payments of your work being done. So if you have so low wallet you cant even stake once in half a year you basically dont even get a turn and your work is useless. What i dont know if you lets say have minimum amount and get a stake once you should get one payment in  months. In that time you do quite more boinc work so is the payment you get in that period any larger than those you get daily if you have tons of GRC? If not than solo mining isnt worth it if you dont have hundreads of  of GRC? ,gridcoin,d2oikz0,1,t5_2zk7j
