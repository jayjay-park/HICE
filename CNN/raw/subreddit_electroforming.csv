Those hexagons are clean did you use a stencil?If you dont mind me asking how did you get the lowered areas of copper inside the raised hexagons? Did you paint inside the hexagons once the rest had plated a bit?Ive seen that some of your older pieces have raised copper patterns as well especially your skyline domes. Do you achieve this pattern by plating over clay imprinted with the pattern? etching the copper w patterned mask?,electroforming,cldn2km,2,t5_2w0vg
