969543,0,t1_chehouv,Well industry details and sector numbers come out quarterly but they do come out just not in this report. I would link to this reporting table instead only because it includes fulltime and parttime job numbers as well. You can also also dig deeper if you want to click the tables cited on the bottom to find out the area age demo and other stats where these job numbers come from if that info interests you.Here is an example of things you can learn from this data. Table  shows the population and employment break down by ages. From last October until right now NS has lost  people from the ages of  most coming after the Liberals cutting of the Grad Retention rebate. This After McNeil spent all election hammering the NDP for not passing policies to keep young people in NS. Again not saying McNeil can do anything about this trend.

1011390,0,t3_25ojwn,I grew up all over Alberta mainly Edmonton and lived in Toronto for a year. Then we moved here to Halifax last year. In the year we have been here we love it. Within a day of being here it just felt like home. I have never had that feeling before. We lived on the west end at first in an older building.  Liked the building disliked the landlord. The thing here is the landlords can be not great. It is definitely a landlords market here. We found it very difficult to find a landlord willing to rent to us with a dog. Cats were no problem. But a dog that was a game changer.  In Toronto it was difficult as well. It was difficult to also find a place to rent in Toronto. I called over  apartments in  weeks. It was painful. Finally found one for  for a  bdrm  sq ft about a  min walk from danforth. Edmonton  was also expensive and it has gone up. We checked online recently to see what rent would be at our old place. When we left  years ago it was . Its going for  now and it was not that great in an ok neighborhood. Definitely check the bed bug registry for any place you may want to rent.We had no issues finding employment.  My SO is a red seal chef. Part of the reason we chose Halifax for our family is that he has no problem getting a job in his trade. Halifax has a large amount of restaurants and cafes for the population size. We are actually saving money here and will be able to actually afford a house. That never would have happened in Edmonton or Toronto for us. Yes some things are more expensive here but it mostly evens out. For instance our insurance was double in Toronto and about the same in Edmonton. Food budget is the same for us. There is no tax on things like vegfruitmilkbread things you NEED to live and  of our grocery list is those types of food. The bus system is not great compared to Edmonton and Toronto. Halifax is sprawled like Edmonton is and it is nice that the bus goes out to a lot of areas. Honestly there is some crappy areas like highfield over in Dartmouth certain parts of Fairview not all certain parts of spryfield again not all. But I find a lot of areas safe and decent.  Also keep in mind that if your on the peninsula you can pretty much walk it within about  mins. Less if you have a bicycle. You would probably enjoy the hydrostone  spring garden the commons downtown Dartmouth and downtown Halifax. Go on google maps and check out some areas on street view.I found it very mild for the winter. We saw snow for  weeks this season. Im used to  months of cold and snow from Alberta. It was a lovely change. Give me another year or two and I will probably be complaining about it. A good pair of rain boots will go a lot farther then snow boots here also. People have been nothing but friendly and helpful to us since moving. Easy to make friends. A funny thing I noticed here is people think anything over  mins is a long commute. Where in Edmonton or Toronto that is considered short. An average commute would be more like  mins one way. Check out Elsies used clothing on spring garden for vintage. There is also a value village and salvation army. There is the bayers lake business park which has costco superstore michaels future shop  best buy movie theater west  etc. Mic mac mall is in dartmouth and there is halifax shopping centre. Also some shopping areas downtown. There is a good variety. No ikea if you like that sort of thing or urban outfitters. But gap american eagle h amp m the bay  sears etcWe recently moved off the peninsula to clayton  park and we are enjoying it a lot. We are near the hemlock ravine where there is walking trails. Also about a  mins walk over to the bedford highway. Its a lovely area. We pay   electricity for a  bedroom  that is cat friendly.  When we lived on the west end it was  for a building with no laundry on site and a crappy landlord who cut a ton of corners. Plus electricity.  It was pet friendly though and you could hear the neighbors and everything outside on a main inersection. If you rent be careful of the utilities. Some places you have to pay for oil and that adds up quick.  Look for something that includes at least heat and water. Electricity is expensive but is not too bad. In the west end apartment we paid electricity but we heated our own hot water tank so that was about a  a month. Here the building pays for heat and hot water. Electricity is about   a month. I did not enjoy Toronto. Very expensive. Just to go grocery shopping I had to pay for parking. And traffic was painful. Not a lot of green spaces and couldnt see the stars. I love seeing the stars here. One of our favorite things to do last summer was to just drive around to different areas outside halifax. All the different beaches Annapolis valley lunenburg mahone bay peggys cove the ovens keji national park. This year we are hoping to get to Cape Breton and PEI,halifax,chj93pz,11,t5_2r77k

1812021,0,t1_ck7hsol,They didnt run a surplus. The Liberals adjusted that the first day they were in by.....  million. Then they adjusted it by another  million but that was more of an accounting nicety. The  million dollar surplus was totally bogus. But to give them some credit they cut  million worth of fat from the schools which was handed right back by the liberals. Here is their surplus.And here is reality.My guess is that they did that to try to win an election that looked really bad. I suspect the liberals will not do any better.To me the NS budget situation is like trying to get out from under  worth of debt with a part time fast food job. The reality is that it is impossible. What has to happen is that you get a trade or some other high value skilleducation and then pay of the even greater debt with the higher income. For Nova Scotia to just try to cut a little here and tax a little there is never going to work.,halifax,ck7ixvb,3,t5_2r77k

2143425,0,t1_clc7tp3,Cars preparing on entering are supposed to yield to vehicles currently in the rotary.What is strange is in the news article they mentioned the cyclist was going to Quinpool Road from Herring Cove Road. If he was doing that he didnt need to go in the roundabout part there is a lane on the far right that goes directly to Quinpool Road I drive through the rotary twice a day for work and I cycle a few times a week sometimes passing through the rotary. Ive seen a lot of questionable manoeuvres  yesterday morning I saw a car entering the rotary from the St Margarets Bay Road in the clockwise oncoming traffic direction. It looks a little overwhelming for someone who isnt quite familiar with the city and the rules especially when its a little busy.I find the best approach to mitigating risk around other drivers is to drive slowly like not gunning it through at kmh carefully and avoid driving sidebyside any vehicles instead in a staggered manner.As a cyclist I wish there was more education. I cringe every time I see a cyclist doing something dangerous. I have some slight perspective because I walk drive and cycle a lot so I can see how some manoeuvres can be risky and try to avoid those situations. It would be nice to see some kind of mandatory education program for cyclists similar to the driver license program. However I dont think the costbenefit being with Halifax being a smaller city and not many cyclists to begin with.edit  some afterthought,halifax,clc9zz4,1,t5_2r77k

The most recent military construction there is the fire command post which was opened in  or   I forget but I believe . The FCP replaced the previous fire command at Spion Kop.Spion Kop was again I believe part of the first use of telephones in Nova Scotia. Fire Command Posts coordinate the firing pattern of guns in a fortification. In the late s breechloading guns were installed in Fortress Halifax that had a range of about  miles. This range was too far for direct aiming and observation thus there were observation posts at the mouth of the harbour which telephoned their observations to the FCP.

2941237,0,t3_2tuj43,I cant get CH to work for some reason. EDIT I got it. Fuck yo paywall.Security staff dispute womans claims about incidentPolice are investigating a complaint of an alleged sexual assault at the Seahorse Tavern in Halifax early Sunday morning.It involved the alleged sexual touching of a woman who was attending the bar there Theresa Rath a Halifax Regional Police spokeswoman said in an interview Monday.However after more information came to light Sunday on social media that left the impression that the alleged victim was not happy with the police response the force recommended that she contact a supervisor to discuss her concern Rath said.During a followup call with the woman Sunday night a police sergeant was able to glean more information about the alleged incident.The file has been forwarded to our sexual assault investigative team for a followup Rath said. Its dedicated sexual assault investigators so they will be looking into the file and speaking to the victim and investigating from there.On Sunday a woman posted on Facebook that she was sexually assaulted at the Gottingen Street tavern over the weekend.A man aggressively asked to see my breast three times before putting his hands on me I said no every time and tried to walk away the woman wrote.The woman who wrote the post could not be reached for comment.She alleged that when the man put his hands on her  in front of security personnel  she punched him in the face.She also alleged that the security staff contracted for the event deemed me too drunk to remain inside the bar and aggressively drug me outside.The man who put his hands on me was allowed to stay in and continue enjoying his night the woman wrote in the post. My friend was also kicked out for defending me and trying to explain to security what had just happened they deemed her too aggressive to be in the bar and physically drug her out as well.In her post the woman also alleged that the security who drug me out told me that I had been asking to be sexually assaulted.The complainant asked others to please share this status and it was reposted numerous times on other social media sites.Christopher Griffin owner of Crimson Security the Halifax company contracted to provide security at the Seahorse disputed the the womans claims that she had been physically removed.I can tell you that she was not touched at all. She was instructed verbally to leave the establishment after she assaulted a male patron and there was no incident as far as any use of force whatsoever physically Griffin said in an interview Monday.He was at the bar earlier in the night but not when the incident occurred. No sexual assault was observed by his security staff Griffin said.Nor did she approach any of our staff prior to being asked to leave the bar. She did not approach any of our staff stating that she had been sexually assaulted stating that she had a complaint about a male patron. It wasnt until she was outside or asked to leave the bar that she brought these allegations up.The complainant has not contacted Griffin or his company. In fact in her posts she erroneously named another large security company.Griffin has not responded directly to the womans allegations. Instead the security company left that up to its client Victor Syperek who owns the Seahorse.So we provided our client with some information thus far because weve had some reports come in and we are awaiting more reports so that we have all the facts to provide to our client before any other statements are made Griffin said.Syperek said the complainant sent him a Facebook message Monday. He told her that he would contact his security staff to get their version of what happened.After he spoke with Griffin later Monday Syperek said he is quite certain his security staff would not be aggressive and they would not be manhandling or anything of that nature.,halifax,co2fjq1,12,t5_2r77k

The article brought up a good point which is just one of the things I am considering.   Just because I state one opinion at one time in the conversation doesnt mean its my ultimate conclusion.  I have noticed that in this sub people do think that a single post both convicts and sentences you but thats just not a realistic approach to judging someones complete thought process.  Its asinine.If you want me to choose black or white at this point too bad.  Yes I formulated one opinion after reading the article which I thought was interesting.   It elicited a response from you.  It doesnt mean thats firmly my perspective but what i said did indeed occur to me.Im not leaning specifically one way or another regardless of whether or not everyone else is screaming about one side of things.   I have friends affected by this but it doesnt affect me emotionally just as me losing my job probably wouldnt keep them from sleeping.  Superficially the situation sounds bad.  But it also seems like the industry has had a sweetheart deal that almost no other industry would or could get.   Im mildly interested in hearing a more thorough analysis of the situation which I havent seen so far.   Everyones made up their mind on this one because of the same  pieces of information theyve been spoonfed by the media and the film industry as if that represents the situation fully.

4032942,0,t1_crfydyc,Solid answer.You seem to be under this misunderstanding that the cross hatch areas have a legal meaning. They dont. Theyre not in the MVA or any regulations in the province. They are just there to be extra visual markers to what is a legal regulation the stop bars.Say youre driving from Tims and the light is red at the intersection in the OP you are required to stop by law at the stop bars. This is true of all intersection with painted stop bars. At most intersections then if safe to do so you may proceed after coming to a complete stop to turn right on a red light. You will notice that coming from Tims there is a no right turn on red sign therefore you can not do that and must remain behind the stop bar. Those busses leaving the terminal? they dont have a no right turn on red sign and therefore may do so legally. A right turn for them is into the cross hatch which has no legal meaning and the stop bars that apply coming from Tims do not apply to them the only have to stop before entering the intersection. Water street is the same. The old do not enter cross hatch at the Dartmouth bridge terminal was never legally binding but the stop bars here are.And those stop bars are not universal if you are there. If traffic leaving Tims through that intersection is slow and you are caught in the cross hatch as the light turns red you are not in the intersection and therefore not permitted to follow through as you would if you were in the intersection. Instead you are required to stop before the cross walk which means inside the cross hatch. Bus drivers can complain all they want but you are well within your legal right and obligation to do so. You just cant enter the cross hatch from the direction of Tims because of the legally binding signage and pavement markings. You can say nope and down vote me all you want but you are simply wrong. Its how the law works plain and simple. they could remove the cross hatch paint from that area and you would not be any more right nor would a driver be any more allowed to drive past the stop bars on a red light.,halifax,crfzim7,0,t5_2r77k

The living wage is an economic measurement of what it costs to live in a given community.In this study theyre looking at how much it would cost two employed members in a family of four to house clothe and feed that family.Thats a useful figure to know. For instance when city planners are considering how much social housing needs to be built when food banks are considering their expansion plans when unions and employers are negotiating.The CFIB stopped being the voice of small business many years ago.

The Hydrostone Market at the end of Young St. has great little shops. Hop up to Needham Park and the Halifax explosion memorial too. Get Pizza at Salvatores or Mothers while youre around there. Drink as much craft beer and apple cider as you can were going through a serious renaissance here. Id choose the Lion and Bright  on Agricola for that beer. Other cool shops  Nurtured if you have kids and Patch Halifax if you like sewing. Definitely DEFINITELY get a burger and fries at Ace Burger Co. at North and Agricola.

They are trying to reinvent way too many wheels while hanging on to a very flawed design. The quadcopter field is somewhat well developed. So why the hell are they designing there own ESCs frames and flight controllers. Take an already designed quadcopter and focus on adding sensors and making better software.The duct design is fucking stupid. Its crappy for aerodynamics and its crappy as a safety shield. Its also very heavy. Its pretty iconic so yea you kinda gota keep it but design a real safety shroud and vacuum form the ears out of the lightest material possible. For some stupid reason they are designing and manufacturing there own ESCs where there are dozens of designs available off the shelf that work great. They were also doing too much in house with the manufacturing end of the things. They should of contracted the bodyframe out to a factory in china from day one. Even doing assembly here is going to push the man hour budget.So many things that I seen in the  or  min I spent in there space. Im forgetting most of it. ,halifax,cuitjww,4,t5_2r77k

5214794,0,t3_3mf171,I would strongly encourage you to be open and honest with your GP.  Tell them that youd feel more comfortable with a GP who has more experience with EhlersDanlos patients and ask if theyd be willing to refer you to a GP that could better serve your needs.  Your GP can talk to other GPs and try to squeeze you into full clinics  which is a lot more than youll be able to do from the outside going through secretaries.Of course be very respectful when you bring up the conversation.  Thank them for everything theyve done for you so far and emphasize that its about experience and not a matter of competence.  As long as you dont come off as an asshole theyll probably be delighted with your request!  Highmaintenance patients are money losers for practices that arent equipped to deal with them.Your GP is a smart and welleducated person who works with other smart and welleducated people.  They know that they dont know everything and cant be expected to.  If theyre petty enough to be offended by your request you probably dont want them as a GP anyway.An example from my personal experienceMy original GP was my only GP for fifteen years.  When I was diagnosed with a cancer she encouraged me to transfer to a different GP who had more experience with managing cancers in young adults.  She set me up with a GP she thought Id like even though his clinic wasnt taking new patients because my file interested him.  She did this because she knew she couldnt provide as high a level of care for me as he could and that I was about to become a colossal timesink with the sheer amount of learning shed have to do to meet my continuing care needs.,halifax,cvekqr5,6,t5_2r77k

5282379,0,t1_cvmdf5x,I think that youre right in the sense that the communities should be focused more on treatment than enforcement. Theres been a social stigma surrounding drug use for a long time thats brought out the worst in the culture surrounding a lot of drugs. Pot generally doesnt hurt people unless its illegal and even then its usually not pot thats hurting people but rather someone acting on a misinformed understanding of the harm level it can cause. Conversely because alcohol is legal its not uncommon for people to assume its a safe substance to consume in more contexts than it actually is. uMakeWorldBetter has a valuable point though cokeect. hurts a much larger percentage of the people that are exposed to it than alcohol. A person who is addicted to drugs doesnt need to go to jail society in general doesnt need drug addicts to go to jail its not worth the money to lock someone up and make them pay for their crimes. Many of them want to get better and we want them to get better. The police have been able to disrupt the supply of drugs that CAN easily hurt people by arresting a few dealers I think this is a much more positive direction our law enforcement is moving in compared to the way some communities have dealt with the problem in the past.Its not perfect but were trying to move away from targeting and shaming people who have a solvable problem and going closer to the roots of the issues to try and keep harm from befalling as many people as possible. I think the future will see some very welcome advances in this direction if we hold onto these values.,halifax,cvmvvze,1,t5_2r77k

Clearly this girl chose a profession or doesnt have the peripheral skills needed for her profession isnt a viable option here. Whats wrong with that? Universities and education are a business they will teach whatever people are interested in paying to learn. There is no right to any work relevant work or even possibility of work in the world just because you are educated on it. You dont go to Manitoba to be a fisherman you dont go to PEI to build cars and you dont stay in Nova Scotia if you want to make K in the financial world.

6070699,0,t1_cyew2d7,Yeah Im pretty familiar with small engines  and  cycle.   This was a recall from Briggs due to the primer assembly basically being so aggressive that  pumps would start blowing fuel out of the vent and naturally the best place for that fuel to go was all over whomever was priming the machine edit  iirc there were some fires associated with this recall.   If the machine was used fairly recently this happened like clockwork.   If not of course the fuel had evaporated during sitting.  Then it required more than  primes but for example  halfway through the rd it would start blowing fuel out of the vent at light speed.   It was pretty finicky even for someone familiar with small engines and required a very careful touch.So logically the best decision was to put a sticker on it rather than shipping a new primer bulb assembly out with an improved design.That was the least of my problems with that heap though heh.  edit  electric starter inferior nonshearing shear pins not brittle enough bad impeller bearing impeller shaft bent due to bad shear pins auger gearbox damaged at same time impeller shaft bent crappy tack welds on the impeller auger tines made of soft steel that bent wayyyy too easily impeller drive belt tensioner problems the steering system often locked up when engaged causing the machine to want to do circles etc.  I put way too many man hours into trying to get the thing to blow snow rather than just doing it.

Have you done any research on Qatar? Slave labour deaths IOC members bribed etc.How about Russia funneling money to Putins friends via winning their Olympic bid?As for your other points respect athletes all you want I see no problem with that.

The large chunk of  options exercised and resold for  while the share prices were pumped up was just the most questionable chunk of change.Someone who worked in the office recounted how greedy everyone got during that time period and how over stressed the lower end employees because they had to deal with fielding all the investor inquiries and such.I have watched a lot of TSX venture listed junior mining and exploration companies and I have worked closely with one CEO of such a company. The vast majority are made to soak investors and enrich CEOs by promoting crappy deposits that will never materialize into profit. There is a strange shyster culture in the junior miners centered in Vancouver. Good on Brad and Fred for heading a company that eventually succeeded and processed to production. Bad on them for getting greedy lying fleecing investors and running away consequence free while the companyinvestors shouldered the fallout.I am most surprised I have never heard a shitstorm of noise from all the Haligonians who lost money on their game.

Probably better than it is now going the other direction onto the peninsula.gtActive transportation is also thrown out the window.For people in parts of Halifax perhaps. Though a new possibility of doing so would open up for people in parts of Dartmouth. Plus people in Halifax could just cycle to Dartmouth or take the ferry.

Failing that be a student at DalSMUMSVUNSCC with a UPass.    If youre taking the bus more than  times ever tickets are cheaper than cash.

That has nothing to do with the Yarmouth Ferry which ridership was down  this year. When the ridership was  the government reported a number very close to the Ferry report projections of  million in to GDP from expenditures by tourists. What do you think it is now that is half.gt Development and Tourism along with the Nova Scotia Tourism Agency determined that provincewide an estimated  million in economic activity was generated by the ferry service.

9698151,0,t1_da8gx4c,When did saying things become trolling?When did engaging issues become trolling?  Did I insult you?  Call you a cuck of somesuch?  I take issue with the automatic gainsaying of Facebook ads because facebook evil lol but yes.  I dont use adblockers because Id rather support content creators and jumping through hoops to whitelist them isnt what I want to do.  But I dont search random dark areas of the internet where ads are a concern.  I click skip ad if its not a content creator on Youtube I am a fan of or I let it play if it is and access my phone and do something else because if I like the content they create on youtube enough I am subscribed and seek out their content why would I deprive them of their livelihood and make them have to rely on sponsored content?  No most people dont use adblockers and most people barely do the types of things you should do to properly use the internet safely.  This is why DDOS attacks that rely on bots have such a huge foothold.  Its less of the case that you can find unsecured routers because most people get them from their bundle providers and Aliant and Eastlink have strong incentive to make sure they lock that shit down but beyond that most people dont care. Until their internet doesnt work and they email or call their techsavvy friendcousininlawbrothersisterwhatever to fix it for them.  I used to be married to that tech savvy lady. She worked as a sysadmin and would have to regularly clean malware off computers of people at work would tell them constantly how NOT to get malwareviruses but then inevitably two or three months later be back doing the same.The average person cant be bothered.,halifax,da8i529,1,t5_2r77k

Mirrors are typically held on with three nuts that screw into studs. For heated mirrors etc there is usually a plastic connector behind a little panel next to your feet. Gotta undo that and then carefully pull the wire out once the mirror is un bolted. If you go to a upull junkyard you can practice the dissasembling on a junk car. You can find instructions to tackle almost any repair on YouTube so always check first. Plastic clips in vehicles get brittle over time. I think the majority of the mouldings are made of pvc plastic. The bosss that screws screw into can sometimes snap off. A great permanent fix is m double sided tape. Sometimes sold as carpet tape the better tape to get its the thick grey stuff that comes with Gopros for sticking the mounts onto surfaces helmets etc. Its crazy sticky truly amazing stuff.

10320739,0,t1_dcdoyvp,This might be my last response  because youre not listening and I would guess havent worked at a large variety of work environments.If were talking about teachers nonunionized counterparts in the private sector are typically more commonly trained. I would argue that many professional or highlyskilled workers in the government are overpaid relative to the amount of work they do.I can guarantee that in my professional field the expectations for the hours of work are as many as it takes to get the work done. I bet the average engineer in my company averages  hoursyear meanwhile a teacher is contracted for about . In fact for most professionals a . hour or . hour day what they are being paid for is rare.Most professionals who are reimbursed with a salary do not receive compensation for working overtime they get to keep their jobs thats the compensation. In fact for some professionals there is no limit to the amount the need to work.Very few professionals outside of government workers again feel entitled to mandated breaks throughout the day. Most dont take them in any official capacity. Do you really think doctors lawyers and engineers stop every day at  for some magical lunchroom break the same as a laborer or somebody working at a call centre? I hate to say it but you commonly sacrifice privileges like these when you take a higher salary in a professional position.. thats the culture.,halifax,dcdwuye,1,t5_2r77k

10331038,0,t3_5nxott,I stored a vehicle at Sentinel Bedford last winter. Prices were competitive and they ran a winter storage special that lasted until if I recall April. The entire facility was amazingly clean and modern. The unit I rented was spotless. Each unit had a rat trap by the door. I was very happy with my experience there.This winter I tried to get hooked up with Sentinel again but they filled up way faster than last year. Im now renting a unit from Metro Self Storage Bedford. The prices are a bit lower than Sentinels but the facility isnt as nice. The doors are rusty and mine is difficult to lockunlock. The units have a major stepup lip between the pavement outside and the beginning of the concrete garage floor. It has to be at least  or  so if you expect to roll a dolly in there its going to be difficult. It was significant enough that I had to back my car in to avoid scraping the front bumper on it. There doesnt appear to be any pestrat traps. Each unit has a light in it which Sentinel doesnt. Security between Sentinel and Metro is identical. You drive up to a gate punch in your passcode and it lets you in. It also dearms your particular unit. If you follow someone in and dont punch in your code at the gate it will not dearm your unit and youll set off the alarm by trying to open it. You do the same to exit which then rearms your unit.Despite the slightly lower price of Metro Id go back to Sentinel if I could. However if youre looking at gtmo long term storage the lower price of Metro will likely save you a decent amount of money. ,halifax,dcf2x2z,8,t5_2r77k

10517717,0,t1_dd07ly9,Taking transit would be ideal if it was any good for anyone that lives outside of the core. I drive and park downtown despite it being a major hassle and expense because it is reliable and fast. From where I am in Clayton Park I can drive downtown in  minutes in rush hour or take a bus for an hour. Also the bus has a high chance of being significantly late overcrowded and stuck in the heaviest traffic route. Even when I lived in a central neighbourhood the busses were unreliable in rush hour because the routes started far out of the city. I did not drive downtown then however as it really isnt a beneficial option if you live on the peninsula.Garages are what I mainly use. Over the past year Ive seen the cheap options become well known and raise their prices. I have a couple cheapish ones I use now but it can be hard to get a spot on some days. Sometimes I street park and feed the meter but theres not a lot of street parking now with the construction. Basically Im just saying its a multifaceted issue.

This land was used for gardening and misc use while he was young and basically became overgrown over decades of no use however he had continue to pay taxes on it for probably the last  years.  Yet when my grandmother tried to get a deed she was unable to because she had no proof of ownership even though she had paid property taxes on the land for years after my grandfather died.  Even after two lawyers she was unable to claim the land.  She eventually stopped paying taxes on it and it got put up for public auction.

There is a huge responsibility on the drivers side and when bikers do things like cut on crosswalks while riding zooming by on the right side in intersections not taking bike lanes that are a street or two over and instead holding up traffic on a narrow street not using proper and signals etc its nerve racking.There are a ton of very good cyclists but the shitty ones really taint driver perception particularly when you consider the possible position they can put drivers in in the event of an accident.

11354777,0,t1_dfieq4m,I didnt downvote but I disagree. The counterpoint would be that courts cannot operate in secret. Criminal charges are a matter of public record and anybody can go down to the courthouse and check it out for themselves. The media acts as sort of a surrogate in for doing it yourself. The courts have found that people accused of a crime do not have the right to privacy when it comes to having their names published.I would agree that the ubiquity of the internet and the ease of google searches complicates things for people who have been accused and exonerated. However you have to balance the low number of false accusations against the public good of having a transparent system. I would hope the low number of false accusations means that they are newsworthy enough that the persons name would be cleared by a google search as easily as it is tarnished However I would agree we are not at that point yet.  As it stands the onus is really on the police and crown not to proceed on cases with little chance of conviction  and that gets us into the awful stuff that has surfaced with the Globe And Mails recent Unfounded investigation where the possibility of ruining somebodys life is used to pressure victims into not proceeding.

11373071,0,t1_dfkwlx8,On the Peninsula there are still lead pipes in the public right of way as well as on private property. In Dartmouth almost all of the publiclyowned pipes were replaced by the former City of Dartmouth before amalgamation so whats left is on private property. The problem is that most property owners didnt replace their section of pipe when Dartmouth was out digging so there is still a lot of it around. Halifax Waters new practice is that they wont replace a pipe unless both the homeowner and the utility do the whole thing because a partial replacement actually makes things worse. Its a good program thats coming and its being guided by some really great research out of Dalhousie. One thing that they identified is that its not the first litre of water when you turn on the tap in the morning that holds the lead its in the third or fourth litre which makes sense if you have new pipes in your home but an old line out under the ground. Halifax Water didnt have to do that level of research. Health Canadas guidelines are to test the first litre and be done. Other jurisdictions are also still doing partial replacements. Im fairly impressed with Halifax Waters partnership with Dalhousie the research that has gone into this that is now guiding policy decisions and their willingness to take this on.,halifax,dfl47qc,3,t5_2r77k

Why not? I want you to really think about this before you respond  You realize that the average salary in this province takes into account everyone regardless of their educational level or level of responsibility correct? So is it fair to compare the salary of someone with six years of university education at a minimum with the salary of a high school dropout? Why do you care about what people in similar occupations earn when you can look at other provinces and see what others in the SAME occupation make? Would that NOT be the most reasonable comparison?So when I see that educators here are number six or seven in the nation in terms of compensation I think thats about where they should be.
