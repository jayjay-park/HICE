4508768,0,t1_csy6jlm,Thanks for your answer. You are right. The scientist has to make sure everything is handled correctly in a biochemical sense. For some interactions this is not as easy as it seems as there are really uncommon interactions that dont seem attractive at all e.g. halogen bonds.I am sometimes doing PDB data mining scans and was just wondering if those uncommon interactions might be underrepresented because programs that are used to generaterefine crystal structures dont treat them correctly.,crystallography,csyz9mk,3,t5_2tieo
