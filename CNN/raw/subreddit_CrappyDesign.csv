Two big problems  you have to pay within  hours to avoid a ticket and you have to remember your trip which road where you got on where you got off the drivers personal information and explicitly detailed information about the car. There is no way to look any of that up. You have to fill in the form from memory and hope you got it right.In Colorado for comparison there is a toll road which is very similar that goes up to DIA. However although you have the option of paying on their website with just your plate number and state they will eventually send a bill to the address of the registered owner with no extra fee  even if its an out of state plate.The fact that CAs system was developed much later and yet is simply awful boggles the mind.,CrappyDesign,cj8azjf,3,t5_2sa3m

I think the misconception comes from american bra sizes forcing all women into AD. There are many women who are much larger who think theyre Cs and Ds when theyre not. A C literally corresponds to a  inch increase in the circumference of the chest to the circumference of the bust line. Which depending on the starting chest size could result in much smaller looking breasts on one woman and much bigger on another woman.

Some writers have proposed connections to age sex or political philosophy and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status. gtSolutions range from compromise to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other. gtgtImage from article iInteresting Toilet roll holder | Toilet paper | Toilet seat Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnjwvrt oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecnjwvrt.

2796773,0,t1_cnlouzc,A lot of HR departments want to be able to compare the diversity of applicants to the diversity of the people they end up hiring so that they can identify and respond to potential issues. If you think about it this kind of information can be really useful. You might find for example that youre not hiring as many women as youd like. Now if thats because not many are applying you might want to try outreach initiatives but if its because theyre not getting through the interview process it might be necessary to respond to potentially implicit discrimination. ,CrappyDesign,cnlze51,7,t5_2sa3m

Using the above users examples a cheap car will allow you to get from point a to point b but a more expensive car will give you a better experience while traveling between those points. A cheap pen will let you write most things but a writer or someone who does caligraphy may enjoy the better experience provided by a more expensive pen. With a computer a cheap one will get you on the internet but a more expensive one will provide you with a better Internet experience. Thats all it is really. Would I spend  on a pen? No probably not since Im not someone who would enjoy it. Same with computers if someone just wanted to get on the internet they wouldnt drop k on a computer no matter how much of a better investment it would be for someone who actually enjoys computers. ,CrappyDesign,col8to2,16,t5_2sa3m

And if you daisychain a second router off of that router then what you said kind of holds true but you also have to then reconcile the fact that you are doubleNATing and a whole host of other issues that get introduced when you connect two routers together. ,CrappyDesign,csby1ux,16,t5_2sa3m

4395486,0,t1_cskxkgb,I think were basically on the same page at this point. However having a gun makes it easier to kill yourself then any of the other items that you mentioned. This is why I linked the oven article. Many people who have contemplated suicide chose not to go through with it during the prep or during the attempt. Guns are quick and easy to load and fire.Im sorry that my phrasing implied that guns make people suicidal as that is obviously untrue. However they do make people more likely to commit suicide. If two people regularly feel a desire to die and one of them owns a gun they are statistically more likely than the other person to end up dead via gunshot. ,CrappyDesign,csl3us9,2,t5_2sa3m

After six months of complaining and waiting for a fix that never came I returned the player and bought a Panasonic which has been no trouble at all.

5387190,0,t1_cw04ee0,I think thats the truly crappy design here. The removal of the AA battery power. I have a Magic Mouse from back when I was an Apple person. It works fine with Ubuntu and I even have it hooked up as a mouse for my Nexus Player now for when I run sideloaded apps without proper TV support. Considering seeing how it plays with my Steam Link when that gets here Friday.Its fairly wellbuilt and works pretty well. The best feature though was that I already owned it didnt have to try to buy a bluetooth mouse for these kind of occasional uses. Its kind of hard to find a mouse thats actually Bluetooth and doesnt use a proprietary dongle.But being able to just change the rechargeable batteries and keep going is a feature not a bug in a mouse. Its not like they dont last for weeks on end even when its hooked up and regularly used.,CrappyDesign,cw09vfr,1,t5_2sa3m

5495154,0,t1_cwdsx1z,Ha I live in Texas and work with many foreigners. I was very puzzled when I started finding these long strips of toilet paper shoved in the hinge and hanging down the side of the door. I didnt get it. Why would someone do that? I would always take it down and flush it. Finally after finding many of these strips of toilet paper hanging like that I realized it was because someone was so afraid of being seen that they were covering the crack. Blew my mind. I mean no one is going to walk up to that crack and peep in on anyone especially not in a workplace.I figure it is one of the foreigners working there who simply comes from another culture. I knew a guy from India here on work visa and he told me the story of him and his colleagues going to a public pool and being horrified by the locker room. They do not have locker rooms in India and are extremely afraid of being seen naked. It was hilarious hearing him tell the story of him and his colleagues walking in there and seeing men walking around naked and seeing that the showers were out in the open. ,CrappyDesign,cwe23jl,5,t5_2sa3m

5635999,0,t1_cwvj87j,gt Theres one thing I really dislike android apps icon is the lack of standardisation  They come in all shapes and formThere are guidelines for how Android icons are supposed to look a lot more detailed than for iOS actually which mostly amount to pay someone to do it or use common sense they just dont have to be square.To be honest I like that they can be different shapes for instance most messaging apps have decent nonsquare icons although itd be nice if there was an option to put a square background behind them if you wanted without downloading anything. It makes it a lot quicker to find the one you want at a glance. But its all kind of a moot point since you can replace any icons you dont like which you cant do in iOS.

Just because the same two items that dont seem to make sense to you are in the same place doesnt mean it doesnt have a methodological purpose.

5996621,0,t1_cy5k2va,A welldesigned artificial flavour can be really good. They typically use materials found in nature but made in the lab as well as materials similar to natural ones but not found in nature mixed in the right ratios to give you something that tastes like the real thing but disperses better in the product and has a longer shelf life so that it doesnt taste like ass one month down the line.A badlydesigned artificial flavour usually has only the most important notes of the food youre trying to imitate for example an el cheapo banana flavour might contain mostly isoamyl acetate and not much else except carriers. Although this does occur in bananas a real banana will have thousands of other chemicals that give it a more complex taste. This is why cheap banana sweets taste like cheap banana sweets and not like bananas.  A betterdesigned flavour still wont contain all those thousands of chemicals but will have enough of them and other similar ones that it gives a much more convincing impression.In a way its a bit like sound effects in movies. Theyre all fake and badly done sound effects really pull you out of the action but welldone sound effects keep you immersed. Just recording the real sounds however wont normally work partly because they just dont survive the recording and reproduction process and partly because moviegoers expect a punch to sound a certain way. Same thing with flavours. A watermelon chewing gum that tastes like a real watermelon would be rather disappointing to our consumers and wouldnt make for a really refreshing or engaging experience.,CrappyDesign,cy5oryb,21,t5_2sa3m

Thats not how conjunctions work. BampD states that both together are true negating that only negates that connection saying that one or both are false but not necessarily both. This is the fundament of DeMorgans Law which states that BampD it is not the case that B and D are true is equivalent to BvD B is not true or D is not true. In either case at least one is false but not necessarily both. Saying both are false is BampD or BvD. The problem lies in the recursive nature of answer D which tends to break logical systems so if answer D is false then BampD or BvD or BvD which comes back around to D being true leading to a contriction. ,CrappyDesign,cyo9hkb,1,t5_2sa3m

6284474,0,t1_cz3tekl,I dont see why this reply got downvoted definitely wasnt me.Its not as much about specific fixes as about a general mindsetissue. Mobilelike design for desktops can be very powerful for websites it suits well or when mobile is your sites main target audience and you cant afford to make seperate versions for mobile and desktop for whatever reason. The problem is that a lot of webdesigners seem to use mobilelike design as their default idea of what a website looks like because everyone else does it without actually understanding why and when it is appropriate. The best advice I can give you is to change your default idea of a website from a mobilelike design to something more akin to what you would refer to as old webdesign the kind that doesnt necessarily even want to fill the full width of a widescreen because it presents its information in a more desktopfriendly condensed way  and work from there. If you can then find a legitimate path of reasoning that leads you from that starting point to a mobilelike design you have found a case where mobilelike design is legitimate.As for this specific caseI personally would just take the original and limit how far the menu can float to the left to how it looks on a  screen then have the right part content and everything get wider on wider screens up to a certain limit. So that on a widescreen you get a centered slightly wider version of the websites  look with free space left and right.If you wanted to use the horizontal space more which I personally wouldnt but I think its a valid approach based on tasteif you want to fit more content onto the same amount of space you could do pretty much what you did in your draft but have the menu always folded out. Folded menus are horrible both on desktop and mobile btw and are another thing that shouldnt be used too lightly. Then you have the content part fill the rest of the screen. This is the closest you could get to a mobilelike design while still staying true to the retro look of the site and staying desktop friendly and desktop is clearly the main audience of this site.,CrappyDesign,cz3z2j0,2,t5_2sa3m

From trying to enact laws that already exist banning automatic weapons certain types of clips background checks to passing bizarre laws banning random scary sounding guns. The equivalent of banning only Ford trucks but leaving Toyota Nissan and semitrucks legal and generally just knowing nothing about the subject.Theres also more shady stuff like the ATF scandalLots of gun owners from personal anecdotal experience approve of certain gun control but simply dont believe sane laws are possible to enact because the democrats pushing such laws are as biased uniformed and untrustworthy as Republicans pushing antiabortion laws.Both the antiabortion and pro guncontrol groups seem to view gunsabortion as an obvious moral evil and are unwilling or unable to compromise and are willing to push flawed bills and fabricated evidence.It makes actual sane methods of fixing the problems of both issues impossible.,CrappyDesign,d3doubq,17,t5_2sa3m

Do you know why a lot of baking pans arent flatbottomed? The dimples actually aid nonstick in those situations why do you think its different in a castiron pan? Even if you dont buy that because like I said the difference is negligible have you ever considered the fact that the polymerized oil coating the pan fills the tiny surface imperfections making the difference even more negligible? gtYou need that smooth surface to be truly nonstick.No you dont but enjoy paying more to jerk yourself off to a perceived difference when there isnt one.

8819164,0,t1_d77kqyo,One time when I was a teenager my buddies and I were sitting in a Giant Eagle parking lot waiting for some more people to show up to go to the movies or something. We had just come from playing airsoft so we were sitting in the far corner of the lot shooting lamp posts and signs with airsoft guns to kill time. As one might imagine teenagers sitting in a parking lot aiming fairly real looking guns in random directions is a thing that gets the cops called on you. We heard a bunch of sirens so we tossed the guns like a lot of guns in the trunk of one of the cars but it was too late. Cops rolled up we were just sitting there listening to music. We got a report about kids with guns sitting on this side of the parking lot... one of the officers says.Oh yeah we were just airsoft guns blah blah blah story above we says.The dulcet tones of The Mark Tom and Travis show are playing in the car.The officer asks to see the gun we have so my friend gives him one of the little pistols that was in the back seat. He looks at it hands it to his partner that guy looks at it feels the weight says something along the lines of Hell apart from the weight these things look pretty realistic.Officer  asks if we had any more with us. We tell him that there are a few more in the trunk. Up all night long and theres something very wrong I know it must be late been gone since yesterday...My buddy takes a step towards the car to turn down the music he knows this album. STAY WHERE YOU ARE! the first officer suggests.He stands still knowing what is imminent. Cops open the trunk theres like a stack of replica AKs mps a sniper rifle etc and   subs.SHIT PISS FUCK CUNT COCK SUCKER MOTHER FUCKER TITS FART TURD AND TWAT.The song is only  seconds long. After about  seconds the officer goes OK turn this shit off so my buddy walks over reaches in the drivers side window...I FUCKED YOUR MOMMMMM. click turns the music off.Someone sitting on the roof of one of the other cars starts laughing a little. Like that tense half giggle of we could get arrested but this is also funny as hell. DOES THIS SEEM FUNNY TO YOU? Mildly.Second officer actually cracks a smile. First guy obviously trying to hold his composure lectures us about brandishing realisticlooking firearms in public and tells us to get the fuck out of here and never do that again.,CrappyDesign,d77xyok,12,t5_2sa3m

8952081,0,t1_d7npb6u,If only stupidity were more fatal again. We could do without so much dead weight. Much of the coerciveness of our society is to help keep stupid people alive or at very least and keep family members of stupid people from suing businesses. Just look at the warning labels on hot beverages and cotton swabs for example.If you want to really look at malicious coerciveness in our society just look at the list of fees associated with your bank account or the fact that you cant default on student loans or if you stop paying your property taxes or if you get sick or if you cantwont work for a living or your manufacturing job moved to Mexico etc. The obligations we have in our society if not adequately met have serious repercussions that not only affect an individuals quality of life but also an individuals ability to survive. Whether an individual is stuck in bureaucratic hell with their bank or local government or trapped in endless welfare cliffs or wrongfully imprisoned or have a sheriff pointing a gun forcing them to leave not caring that they have nowhere to go its very easy to let our barbaric society ruin somebodys life especially if the individual cannot afford an expensive lawyer or buy off a judge.The fact that traffic signal exists the way it does at very least implies that the people who owned the house were too powerless to convince someone in town hall to do something which is vicariously malicious.You claim that stupidity is more common.

10197861,0,t1_dbzio6o,This is intentional. Its for a grandparents shower so we can assume theyre at least older if not straight up elderly. Someone who is older likely has mobility issues or at least is less spry they they used to be. Someone like that cant avoid the start of the cold water as easily as others which would introduce the opportunity for injury.By having the pressuretemperature valve outside the shower stream they can start the water then get in the warm shower. As others have said most modern shower valves other than the cheapest have a device that keeps the temperature consistent even as the water supply shifts. So unless you like to change the temperature during your shower not just keep it hot as the hot water supply drops this would work fine. I contemplated putting my pressure valve outside the custom shower I just installed but ended up moving the door so it was easy to turn on without getting wet.,CrappyDesign,dbzzfvu,4,t5_2sa3m

And previous Minivans didnt need a button to be pressed to column shift...meaning you could reach for the wiper stalk and grab the shifter instead.

11129108,0,t3_5ysy16,I think a lever in the centre console is a fucking abomination unless it is for a manual transmission. Theres absolutely no technical reason to have a shifter there if the box is electronically controlled. Of course a column mounted shifter makes more sense for an automatic than this though. However I guess if the car has shifter paddles then perhaps a column mounted shifter isnt right and mounting something on the dashboard like that makes sense. ,CrappyDesign,deth3ki,3,t5_2sa3m

11749284,0,t3_67l3q0,Someone brought it up as a joke when they were having a meeting for what the product should be called.  Probably framed it like well its a file for feet pedi is a prefix meaning feet so why not pedifile?  assuming everyone would hear the pedophile similarities.  Unfortunately nobody did.  The person who suggested it cant point out the similarities since nobody got the joke they might fear a backlash of presenting a good idea just to prove its not a good idea.  So they keep their mouth shut and hope someone down the line realizes it.  If nobody in the meeting realized it they cant get in trouble for not realizing it either.Unfortunately  everyone below the line working on the project is a good subordinate and kept their mouth shut.  How do you tell your boss their idea is bad?  So graphic designer does their job.  Printer does their job.  Packaging does their job too.  And now its on the market.  Too late to fix because a joke went over no less than  peoples heads.,CrappyDesign,dgrt71b,1,t5_2sa3m
