1968073,0,t3_2gi4nb,Hey yall. My name is Blair and I live in Oregon. I just turned  a few days ago. Im a mom to  kiddos . and  and married to my great husband. We went to burning man in  where my husband proposed to me at temple.  We went back  and has the worst experience ever I tore a tendon in the back or my foot... We were camping with about  friends that we have known for a long time.  None of them cared enough to drive us to the hospital to get checked out had they done his we could have come back to burning man... Instead I got taken to Reno via  ambulances. We had to get same day tickets out of Reno to come home... When our friends got back and we went to pick up our stuff.... Most of it was ruined some of it was stolen.... It was a terrible experience.... We have wanted to return home since but have been so worried if something happened again... We would be in the same situation. It would be amazing to document our trip back home to meet a group of people that want to care build a community and have fun!!! ,BlackRockRunaways,ckqcr2a,1,t5_33ksx
