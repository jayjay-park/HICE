9027137,0,t3_53rdza,Thoughts on idea I love the idea of integration with streamers. It benefits those learning the game veterans improving their collections and those who live off twitch greatly. Im still a little confuzzled on the themestory but thats because I just started this week.Frustrations GREEN LACKS ROCK PUNS There really isnt anything major as of yet It ran smoothly decks were balanced For Twitchcon but still! The characters were easily distinguishable from oneanother... All well and good this week.Favorites MEDFRAME TECH IS NEW WAIFU The use of cards like Precise Detonation is fascinating to me. Moreso is the prospect of high ground for ranged units. The more interaction with the environment the better.Implementations A history of moves would be nice. Oh and different card backs for abilityeffect provided cards Blessings etc. for QoL.,Shardbound,d7wx4tj,1,t5_3fnsc

10127756,0,t1_dbrmzhz,Sounds good. And I use the hp example as a super late reply to another point I think that was made last night. Theres  reason to play Nades early its much better to drop late when the board is scarier and hard removal has already been used and your hero is actually in a place where they need to start whacking stuff. But odds are late game youve already taken damage. A health cost would add some kind of preventioncounterplay. Either force them to play it early because they cant afford the cost or put them in a situation where they cant afford the cost. Obviously you dont want the cost being too much to the point theres zero reason to run it but itd be nice to have a way to play aroundprep for Nades outside of holding onto that one hard removal youd really like to use on something scarier.,Shardbound,dbrni14,2,t5_3fnsc

10763903,0,t3_5txvve,Id like to hear the reasoning for removing or considering to remove Temporal Striker from Blue. It seems like a core card needed for an out or to zip in and finish the game. Its weakly stated for the cost so all you really get is that flexibility.,Shardbound,ddq7taz,1,t5_3fnsc

10814047,0,t3_5un19c,The three player matches have definitely been for fun goofs and had some behaviour that normally would not occur. Its always good to report them though for any future content or to keep it in mind.    The Official Discord has sections especially for bugs troubleshooting feedback etc. where people post what they find. The link is in the info bar to the right of the reddit and also on the download page.,Shardbound,ddve5dm,1,t5_3fnsc

10953050,0,t3_5wedhm,AFAIK currently theres exactly  card that generates random cards and its yellow generates  but they have to cost  mana.  So yes it can pull from any color but its also the lowest tier of creatures.,Shardbound,de9q9is,3,t5_3fnsc

11339238,0,t1_dfh98h9,Yeah I never got too deep into competitive magic i wasnt sure how to word my post. I wanna build a good deck but all I can come up with is gimmicks lol. Its time I do research I figured Id start with a good stuff style deck to learn,Shardbound,dfha6zi,1,t5_3fnsc
11359591,0,t3_623t8u,You can go to the house roster or your friend list and right click your name to leave your house. In the future Id recommend asking quick questions like this in the Discord since youre likely to get a much faster response. If you need a link just PM me and Ill grab one for you.,Shardbound,dfjl7i2,2,t5_3fnsc

11536826,0,t1_dg3p0mz,yeh i dont understand your examples they have no bearing on the potential power loss of conceding enemies and do nothing but flip the table from concede being a loss for everyone compared to playing a game out effectively losing the power that wouldve been generated from actions between the concede and end of the game to concede being a win for everyone which still isnt healthy and still wouldnt be if it were only a gain for the player who didnt concede,Shardbound,dg3p9hm,1,t5_3fnsc

11539995,0,t1_dg3a5zh,What? Chess sucks?Honestly what ruined chess is its metagame. The fact that its been around for hundreds of years means my meta knowledge needs to account for all the strategy made in that time.Actually playing chess is fun IMHO.,Shardbound,dg426ox,1,t5_3fnsc
11553407,0,t1_dg5gsp3,Right now animations are entirely cosmetic as soon as you issue a command its complete and you can issue further commands as though the first was complete as long as you click where the units youre interested in will be when the animation finishes. There are a couple cases where RNG makes it so that you still probably need to wait out the animation to know where things arehow much health they have left but mechanically theres nothing preventing you from issuing every command you want as fast as you can click.,Shardbound,dg5kz1r,6,t5_3fnsc
11598780,0,t1_dgaod7o,Thank you for this! I was wondering if Orange was overpowered or if it was just because I was playing Green which Im pretty effective with against most things except Orange and occasionally Purple.,Shardbound,dgaqaum,2,t5_3fnsc

11620985,0,t3_65tjsh,When there are many people on a shard that is what allow almost everyone to get gold reward too.Also when shards with quests like win in less than X turns stack that would allow to complete many shards at once just had the case win  turns and we did more than  with  people on one game each. I guess it is OK as it is right now wasting power EDIT Another example where the game would be too much rewarding is the combo quest Play OrangeDeal DamagesDeal damages with spellsPlay spellsWin in less than X turns. This is a full combo so should be pretty rare but can happen. Plus just thought of this but is it better to waste power or and get Gold rewards twice or not wasting it and get Bronze reward and gold on multiplayer shards ?,Shardbound,dgd8zri,1,t5_3fnsc
11645672,0,t1_dgfvuq4,Thatd be good even if its just a minor additional bit of clarity.  Though obviously I think its fine as is as well.   Its really only a mistake someone would ever make once.,Shardbound,dgg1u4r,2,t5_3fnsc
11654615,0,t1_dgh05ib,This is something we are considering but the security concerns are much greater than just providing read access to this data. We have a lot of other feature work in the short term so this would be something well look at later down the road.,Shardbound,dgh2csd,4,t5_3fnsc
11685420,0,t3_66qc8g,  Yeah Grove Tender is generally considered bad times unless you build a deck around surviving Blight spread anyway. But in a deck thats built to turtle and heal through Blight it can be a good way to get more crap on the ground.  I dont honestly know if the Kovashi guards need to be MORE difficult to take down. Theyre already pretty beefy especially if you have a Lifespringenhanced Lifespark following the pack around.  Issue I have with seedlings is that they dont really feel intended to play ALL of them in one deck. Stonecaller is useless if youre playing Blightspore. And really Blightspore CANT be played safely until you have your healing established two Lifesprings or Lifespring  Voice of the Squall. So there cant ever really be a seedling deck.   You can Lifespring a Lifespark to get that effect though.  Most of the Hard Removal cards have a penalty for the power deleting a unit provides. Red feeds their enemy a buff card Purple makes them draw a card Yellow cant reliably eposition the minion that replaces that enemy. Having a attackless slow moving wall to deal with is Greens Hard Removal penalty. Its not even really that bad you an use it to Canal a stronger minion behind enemy lines or to protect against a Pillar of Judgement.,Shardbound,dgkk5wk,2,t5_3fnsc
