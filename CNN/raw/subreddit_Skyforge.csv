They have also mentioned events called invasions which randomly pop up and drop rare items and can influence the outcome of events on the server. Ive also seen someone mention that on the Russian beta there are open world zones bigger than the largest one we have now  they said  times larger taking multiple hours to complete but that could be an exaggeration.Ive not seen any post confirm the total amount of instances world zones raids invasions etc. Im assuming the  provinces on our follower mission tab will all have their own sets of content. They mentioned that the Temples we build only give bonus stats when inside those provinces. How many provinces will be unlocked... and how many zonesinstances will be in each province for launch... Im sure they dont even know yet. Maybe someone who has had access to the Russian betas can give us a rough idea?

The damage increase while burning is great to keep up all the time as its a pretty huge increase for your basic attacks to build back up your concentration.  The one that removes the fire dot for  increase on pierce is amazing wipes out basic mobs easy.I dont have any talents that persuade me to leave up the lightning buff yet so when I rotate I put up the fire dot do  aimed shots resource depending hoping to get a proc for the rapid fire pop then then finish with piercing shot before the fire dot leaves and rinse.  The ultimate seems.... lackluster.Unfortunately the bulk of talents is on the tip of the arrow the shape of the archer talent tree.

This is not going to be like EvE where the players that have been playing the longest can never be caught up to. I thought I recall them mentioning as well of the caps being retroactive. Either way they have intentions for having new players be able to catch up to older ones.

The only plus so far is it looks pretty fucking good. In attempting to make it an mmo for everyone the cut the good stuff. I do not understand any of this new and fresh talk this game is pretty much gw clone. The only things actually new are probably the class changing limits and atlas. Its like everyone is blinded by how good the game looks. All these things are the same as previous MMOs with the exception that they look better.Also the class changing for right class at right time is total bs unless you play all classes evenly they wont be decent.

4594604,0,t1_ct9qi9f,With how gear is set in skyforge i mostly meant something like actually being able to buy a certain gear with a certain passiv not just PVP focused gear as theres no PVP stats whatsoever in this game in the end its just about how you want to grind for something anyway since getting gear from pve is pretty much the same and awfully RNG based as stats vary in ranges but with how prestige works it would probably be too much of a mess to handle unless they go with prestige dependent gear or something and it would actually add somthing to do after reaching cap rather than afk on the orderville tab.Thinking back about PVP open maps and with the GvG incoming i agree it wont serv much of a purpose tho.For those executions aside from screwing up FFA into a big mess the system itself is stupid and is awfully unfair to melees Lightbinder bullshit M Exec id rather have everyone at  than put up with somthing like this. ,Skyforge,ct9qpxx,-1,t5_2ymb9

Skyforge is very nontraditional and has a plethora of things that if you read about will immediately seem extremely pay to win until you realize how the system works. For example that the fact that you can use  to get in game currency seems problematic until you realize there is no trading in skyforge and very little you can actually buy with the currency in the first place.Basically the system is designed in a such a way that there are some things that the casual can use  for to catch up to the hardcore but there is nothing the hardcore can use to get ahead of everyone else and you wont find yourself in a spending race to stay competitive.,Skyforge,ctcmm2l,9,t5_2ymb9

As a veteran of Gw i can say we dont miss your whining on the forums thanks for leaving this game does have grind dont like it please uninstall now and install the aforementioned game. dont like the UI? please get a job as a game dev and lets see your super duper awesome UI. if you cant produce HTFU sit down and enjoy if not please go to wow that is all. ,Skyforge,ctg677f,-2,t5_2ymb9

4681939,0,t1_ctklu1h,Here is an ideaEquip Volley and Grave with Shield of the Banished.Augment your Cursed land with Cyclone Augment your Grave with Cemetery.Here is the plan. Slam your enemy with DoTs and Skull Toss as normal. When they run away cast Grave. With the two talents Grave will throw them into the Cursed land and Cyclone means the first time they try to exit it they will be dragged back to the center.Use that time to pop Lich slam them with LMB until you get about  stacks then pop Volley of darkness from afar as they struggle to get away. You gain all your HP back they get a couple persistent DoTs and eventually they melt under the weight of Skulls and Walls.IMPORTANT NOTE Volley will only heal you if you have active DoTs going form Sickening Nightmare. The more you stack the better the heal.  stacks gets you back around ths of your HP stack more if you have the ability to.Or you could pop a Carrion summon and let that wail on them while their speed is reduced then when it comes close to the end of its time convert it into a shield and keep laying into them with Plague  Hellfire.Well thats my idea anywho...,Skyforge,ctkpdrw,1,t5_2ymb9

4868664,0,t3_3hjjln,I have been doing a couple of things different.  I am not as experience as you are so I would love the feedback. When I pull trash mobs I use resolute rebuff early.  Often I will do earthquake to get them closestun.  If they are all close I will then  stray attack II then resolute rebuff.  I almost always do this when soloing. Also I have been using stray attack II for dmg and to activate impulse chargeimpulse barrier.  This seems to do more dmg and gives me more shielding than doing collissionbattering ram.  I even use this when attacking a single boss.  The constant use of stray attack II activating impulse seems to recharge willpower faster than lunge even.  I also use my spear to pull mobs letting the group know which to attack first if there are  enchanterscasters.  I also use it if there are stray mobs to pull into the fighting zone. ,Skyforge,cu88d5x,1,t5_2ymb9

Everything YOU think you found out yourself was probably found out from the russians first so please  shut up     Spamming Rockets from  meters range hiding behind everyone until you can execute someone from far away isnt exactly what i would call skilled.    Well in the meantime i get  scores in vs and  in vs on my minmaxed slayer i dont make Screenshots of my scores because i dont feel like i have to show other people how awesome i am.  I played a swinging chains backstab build from the beginning never used bloodharvest ONCE.  People most man premades aswell leave the arena and stop queuing if they see the name of my mates and me.  But i guess thats just because Slayer op and not because we are good at the game and the class.  We played against multi slayer teams man premades mostly several times  we destroyed them  they started to flame us  not for playing slayer obviously they are the guys that only play slayer because bloodharvest op  but because all of us had pally symbol nothing special at k really and a perfectly min  maxed char symbol and stat wise.  You can start to flame me for playing slayer but you and your gunner will still stay bad until the class gets buffed even if you write  guides.If you read the context to my phrase games are for having fun then you would see that it was a perfectly fine argument. Someone said its okay to raise your temple ranks  i said yes it is  you said no it isnt and you screwed your character if you did screwing my character means having less fun i guess because if im useless then i have no fun  i said yes it is because it ultimately let me have more fun because i could progress faster and didnt feel weak once.    I dont even know how someone that didnt pay at all can know if or if not your character gets screwed if you boost your prestige with your order without copying what other people tested and posted.I dont even know how someone with sub k prestige knows much about the game at all most of the stuff happens past k. Everything before k is just unbalanced pvp wise. You cant just oneshot everyone at k  because most people have the pally symbol.    And sorry for my poor english.

5052243,0,t3_3k4voc,Skyforge is a good game that said there are some serious flaws and contradictions in the design of the game that if not fixed are going to mean that it will be fairly dead in the pretty near future.. The game is has grinding as a core activity but has severe caps on that activity. People who enjoy grinding like the satisfaction of spending time in games working towards and achieving goals the feeling that there is something to do or be working on the hard caps remove this kind of satisfaction. You can only play the game for about  hours a week and achieve things that feel meaningful.. The ways of playing after cap the order system is almost entirely divorced from the main game. Other than grinding for ammo or supplies which you can get through the order system anyways there is nearly no connection to the game. That means the only way to progress in the game after cap... is by not playing the game but instead playing a mediocre browser based game that offers little excitement or challenge.. The game lacks art assets. There are very few varieties of enemies. While some are extremely well designed the amount is very low and nearly all of the bosses are simply scaled up versions of monsters you have already fought before. There is a huge amount of recycling of art assets. Every class has maybe  or  weapon designs. The rest will probably be paid.. The game lacks meaningfulunique equipment. Literally every item you pick up has boring stats and no real special effects. Until raids they are all also just named RingSwordShieldetc. This feels like complete laziness. That there are no cool unique weapons or items to get along the way makes the game feel very empty. . The way the game is monetized is a bit obnoxious. Premium does nothing valuable and theres zero reason to purchase more than a day of it since you cap too quickly anyways. Pantheons basically require around  of member spending to advance and be competitive. The Order System is not fun to spend money on. The going whaling model is going to alienate everyone who is not a whale and this includes people who are willing to spend around  on the game but not more than .. Maintenance and cap reset time are in conflict. The moment you actually can play again you get gated once more by server downtime. This is completely stupid from a customer experience perspective. Since you cap in around  hours of play that means that you spend around  days with nothing to do. Then the moment you can do something the server goes down for the night. I would say that the game is good but that its flaws are crippling. If it wants to succeed it needs to figure out how to build for long term. The current model is just going to result in a lot of attrition as players lose interest.,Skyforge,cuuzj9e,0,t5_2ymb9

5089679,0,t3_3kq1gj,The cap limit makes sense if you keep in mind a few things all of which involve how badly it was executed. They dont give you enough sparks to unlock a new class within your first week of play despite giving you bonus sparks for your first week. You will always be a couple nodes short unless you do some massive minmax finangling with the reliquary bonus sparks.. The weekly limit they start you with is WAY too low. It should easily be at least . or double the amount. People who say they never cap their sparks either never fucking play the game to begin with or have accrued months of sparks and cap increases.. The cap made sense when the game first launched CBT or OBT but now that the game has had months of life new players should not be penalized by the ultra restrictive fresh start caps. New players should have no cap or much larger caps letting them do more rather than chug along the atlas for two or three days then run completely out of shit to do.. They STILL havent brought out the catch up mechanic. That comes next week and allows you to earn more sparks to close the gap between those who have been playing for months.. The caps should have been serverbound not account bound. If they were meant to limit progression and gate development releases thats fine. But how does that affect Joe Newbie who just started? Theres NO reason players who just started need to be gated. The content is already months old.The cap system is fine IF DONE RIGHT. Right now its just decent idea shit execution. Anyone who defends caps as they are either idiots long time veterans founders who are trying to keep everyone else down or barely play at all and never cap.,Skyforge,cuzhyq3,23,t5_2ymb9

5212900,0,t1_cve0on3,At my level of k prestige my impulse damage is k. Its high! But my pantheon is full of archers with around k max damage. Even with  discharge recovery and popping every  seconds strluck single shot at  per second will out damage us already.  Not to mention the talent to wipe burn and inflict  dmg is likely based on base dmg and not on impulse dmg. Sure I have  levels of Double Discharge but how much extra dmg that does isnt so clear to me. I havent come up with a formula however the relationship between strengthaccuracy and spiritDR isnt the same and dont think they are comparable.You know I cant resolutely say strluck is better than our build. But it does feel there are more strength nodes than spirit nodes on the upper atlas.  I know for sure there are not equal number of the types of node.  Do you farm blue sparks and hunt down these spirit and luck nodes? I also tale strength nodes. Thats what I do forgoing unlocking classes just to keep ahead.  That philosophy includes using Ultimate Strength and the Valour symbol just to give that extra edge as strluck archers will often take spirit symbol.  I have  symbol slots so I have plenty of space to accommodate.All I know is that our initial hit will always be stronger. Our Wildfire will wipe all mobs and Impossible dungeons can be easily speed ran. This initial hit may also be key for pvp performance as its a breeze with this archer build.One more thing. The build I use symbols and rings is exactly the same as I use for my lightbinder. He hits everytime for K on impulse in pvepvp. And can do about k DPS whilst shielding and buffing. The same as a mediocre DD. I only choose spiritluck because Im too lazy to change rings and symbols every time. And at the moment its working well for me.,Skyforge,cvecis3,1,t5_2ymb9

5271782,0,t1_cvku7ej,Well when you say weak mobs you need to know that they are not weak but a dps test of sorts. They do extremely high dmg but are very easy to cckill. Attacking a pack mob and just standing there while it kills you proves nothing. Learn to use the F key to lock on targets. It will serve you well. Open regions have really bad memory leaks so the FPS thing is true but not a big problem. PvP has many stuns and cc but there are also symbols and secondary stats that reduce cc effects. True the pvp is a bit unbalanced but the game is new and things like that need time to be fixed.The bit about paying for progression and having to pay to progress is completely untrue. You dont have to pay anything and paying gives you a small advantage but not enough to make you better than a skilled fp player.When you fought the  bar mob you go on to say how you couldnt dodge attacks while you had a dashdodge indicator on you for like  seconds.The speed increase is there exactly to prevent kiting and promote group play I guess.

5587010,0,t1_cwplmip,You are now officially the greatest contributor to this thread. However being as I literally just started playing I am unfamiliar with the actual caps and rate of obtaining the currencies for those things that are capped. I am also unfamiliar with the purposeimportance of leveling towers vectors and ring boosters. In the end I can just accept that they are all crucial to having higher stats and thats that.Thanks also for listing some of the credit sinks but in the end it just serves to slow you down a bit. For example the inventory size it doesnt directly contribute to your stats and while it is convenient and potentially even necessary later on we can assume that it is not necessary to buy a fully expanded inventory and skip this for now since it is just a situational matter of Ya know I think Ill upgrade my inventory size this week.Premium is a given and should probably just straight up be deducted from the credit cap. But it also is not awfully overpriced with the cred to argent conversion from what I can tell.What Im more interested in hearing is converting these costs into time investment when considering all available options for obtaining those currencies and considering the currency caps outside of paying money. IE How long it would take to get all  vectors to max rank and Im not even sure thats actually relevant afaik you only really need to max one vector depending on your class by only free to play. Taking into consideration the caps. Yes Im asking you to do the conversion for me but seeing as Im not familiar with the higher prestige core concepts itd be foolish to do it myself. In fact I didnt even initially understand why we were multiply the numbers you gave until I realized it was because there are  vectors and  temples.,Skyforge,cwpmcsu,-1,t5_2ymb9

I never tried to get a high prestige fast because I knew it can gimp me. Concentrate in getting talents symbols and nodes that help you right stats for starters and find a class you are comfortable with and learn to play that WELL. After that everything else follows. Your adepts and chapels are important and you should upgrade them too to get more prestige but dont accelerate the quests with cash just let them do the work at their own pace. At little over k I was in the phase where I couldnt get a new mainquest for a week because too little prestige. I didnt care I concentrated in learning how to master my favorite class. Again after getting over that prestige seems to fly to me from doors and windows. Im rarely in a situation where my prestige is too high for the rewards and I can still choose to do the easiest squads if I want to. High prestige is not everything.

6770999,0,t3_48hr51,Lucky shot is ALWAYS a wasted symbol slot. Its ALWAYS complete garbage. It might be the worst dps symbol in the game. Id rather even pick oculat because adds can sometimes aggro it instead of you. Kinetic symbol is never a wasted slot for dps.I think you meant slayer symbol instead. Having slayer symbol equipped might be better than having a natural  crit for group and raid content. Not solo not pvp Capping your crit with slayer symbol will let you swap  chapels into stats that arent crit which will increase your dps. accuracytempersolidity. Discharge recovery isnt amazing for current class meta. You will only lose slayer symbol if you get aggroed by enemies or if LB leftclicks on you... which they shouldnt be doing which means most of the time you will have slayer symbol up even if youre taking random aoe damage. For example in raid situations it should be a noticeable dps increase if you used slayer symbol and switched  of your chapels to temper  equipping the  valor symbols. In a raid support aura  injections buff all your stats equally which means youll get tens of thousands of extra valor for the cooldown block it would be a big waste not to take advantage of all those stats.,Skyforge,d0jrvgh,1,t5_2ymb9

I also tried the game again after being away for  months.You cant find any groups with group finder and if you try manually with LFG you are told to fuck off as you have too low prestige. If you try to do those open world areas for revelation purple sparks you will not find anyone there. Your only option is to do vs pvp for those and you can probably guess how good chances you have there regardless of the scale system.There is some new invasion missions but at least i could not solo them on k prestige. Once i got a group into one of them with a k guy. Scaling must have been broken in that one as i could take down them mobs faster then this k did.So yeah Skyforge is pretty much solo game currently.,Skyforge,d2qq5j9,4,t5_2ymb9

8483113,0,t3_4vvvu6,Looks like the guide focuses on one thing and one thing alone Be good at what you do. And that means minmaxing early and practising class abilitytalent mechanics. Pretty decent.Also the three beginners represent tank support and dps and therefore to use which class depends on the role you want to main in the future. There are much more dps classes in the game than the other two and also much more people focusing on dps and dps classes. Proficiency in dps enables you to solo more dungeons where as Tank and Support becomes gradually more negligible as dps increases over prestige. Thus i suggest DPS aka Cryomancer. You do need to max the other two atlases as well for their symbols and symbol slots but if youre a premium you can max them by playing cryo after youve maxed cryo by obtaining evolution sparks.,Skyforge,d61xn1r,1,t5_2ymb9

9576269,0,t1_d9sq7ll,Because population is too low. There is x  man raid x  man invasion dungeon  distortions avatar travatar all pvp maps and x  man noninvasion dungeons. Im not even counting the squads because ppl solo them. Oh and I forgot most maps have multiple difficulty lvl so lets doubletriple that. If I wanted to do OIA th gen and I used the queues system I could wait multiples hours doing no other dungeon only region work while in queues until  other players also did the same thing and queued for that particuliar dungeon. Assuming we get to that point we could still fail the dungeon because we wouldnt have a good team. There is simply not enough population for that to work. In the chat I can just ask If other ppl need OIA th gen. If multiple players show interest I create a group and run it if not I do something else and try again in chat later. It is much more efficient. ,Skyforge,d9tgycv,2,t5_2ymb9
