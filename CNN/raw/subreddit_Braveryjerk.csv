19220,0,t1_cegh0yz,Screw those medieval cunts and their medieval beliefs. Its impossible to shit with  years of christian church stuck in our butts.Humanity is constipated and the cause is religious institutions. Also Im tired of respecting church. Not long ago they set people in fire just because they wanted to. I really hope that humanity will get rid of religion as we know it the puritanism the church the old rituals and start seeing religion as an inner way for our selves to deal with the unknown. Not to kill and cut other peoples freedom just because they dont agree.Feels good to vent against religious institutions on Christmas.,Braveryjerk,cegmdlf,2,t5_2tl1h

43362,0,t3_1uknap,Let me tell this straight.No one can beat the Untied States of America in any war scenario. All our government has been doing for the last twenty years is developing a military capable of overcoming any conflict it encounters. All of this has been tuned and retuned in the last  years.No China isnt going row over on its one antique aircraft carrier. There is no way a force of any consequence could make it to our mainland. Youd be blown the fuck out of the water before you were even close.Missiles would come down with the shield that we have developed so they are out. What now?The second someone started a conflict with us that would pose a threat greater than petrol bomb we would cut all your communications with the flick of a switch. No more satellites for you. We would mobilize to the closet base and start setting up a supply chain. Yes we have a base close to you. We have bases all over the world. During this time there would be more drone activity than you thought possible with us pin pointing your government. Once the intel was complete we would behead your country and strike perceived threats and infrastructure. If this didnt cool your jets and open a line of communication of diplomatic resolution we would freeze your monetary assets globally and wait it out until you cry Uncle Sam.We won. The world is going to change radically over the next twenty years and we will be the keepers of this planet. So be prepared. The best thing you can do is try to stockpile weapons cause local guerilla warfare is all you will have left.Peace planet Earth.,Braveryjerk,cejd9e3,1,t5_2tl1h

I am trained in zorse warfare and Im the top pitfighter in the entire Meereenese armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another offering to the Red God. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Westeros mark my thrice damned words.

As we speak I am contacting mine own secret network of little birds across the Realm and your trail is being tracked with hounds right now so you better prepare for the long night crow. The long night that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You know nothing kid. I can be anywhere anytime and I can warg into over seven hundred animals and thats just with my bare thoughts. Not only am I extensively trained in Unsullied combat but I have access to much and more of the arsenal of the Westerosi Merling Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your House off the face of the Realm you little turncloak. If only you could have known what blood and fire your little clever mummers farce was about to bring down upon you mayhaps you would have held your fucking tongue.

475900,0,t3_1zjigj,summary of braveryjerk a bunch of socially awkward computer nerds who have no friends in real life and feel the need to make online friends they can hang out with. for some reason ron paul is considered god racism and bigotry is totally okay because its funny when in reality people just say things like nigger faggot asscocks because they are uncomfortable with their own hatred of negros and their own sexuality. also they just like to say vulgar things because they have the developmental minds of a  year old.everything on this subreddit is so repeated copied unoriginal forced and beaten to death there is literally no content left in it. its like a broken record repeating itself over and over and over again. for some reason everyone keeps coming back here to repeat the same garbage and come up with new garbage that isnt any more original or creative than the same shit this place has been spewing out for months now.dont even get me started about the satire. why the fuck does reddit need something that satires itself? if reddit is so bad and needs to be made fun of that much why are you people even on this website? why are you making fun of ratheism instead of doing something that actually contributes one iota of usefulness to the human race? why do over  autistic kids keep coming back here and partaking in the online circlejerk over shitty comics racist jokes ugly CSS formatting and uneducated watereddown sociopolitical commentary?because youre all addicted to the orangered. you want to see a little mail icon with a big number next to it and you want your fake name to have a big number next to it to. seeing the orangered is an instant gratification stimulus that tells you that you are part of something. it doesnt matter how mindless or downright retarded it is. as long as youre considered part of a group and are constantly being awarded for a meaningless virtue called bravery youll keep refreshing the page like a junkie.just look at the front page of the subreddit. half the posts are by users with green names. the mod team of braveryjerk makes up about  percent of all subscribersviewers but contributes something like  percent of all content. they live in their special secret club the braveryjerk modmail and only leave their jerking cave when they need to battle atheists downvote somebody on rSRS  or post a link in order to get more karma. mod mail is like a channel where mods drop links to their shitty ass effortless posts and insist that all the other mods upvote them.everyone who isnt a mod is considered pure shit and doesnt get any attention from the mods only from other nonmods. this leads to all these regular users kissing the asses of the mods day and night hoping to earn their approval and upvotes and even maybe get modded one day.if youre still reading i feel sorry for you. my point is if braveryjerk was ever worth anything it has now gone to total shit so peace bitches i wont miss any of you.

512346,0,t3_1zzvqo,Im sorry but did the Broncos already lose? Oh thats right. The game isnt even over yet. In fact its only halftime. Does not having the lead at halftime count as a loss? Is that what youre saying? Because if youre saying that I can assure you that youre wrong. Why would you make this topic when the game is still on? The Broncos are still playing right now and they have been the best team in the NFL for how many years now? Theyre playing one of the worst teams in the NFL who just happen to have a lead because theyre feeding off the energy of playing in the Superbowl. But you know what? They still fucking suck. The Broncos are one of the best fucking teams in the NFL they went  last year and would of won the Super Bowl if the kicker didnt choke. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because youre going to be embarrassed when the Broncos wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that the Seahawks just stepped out of bounds short of the st down when they needed to get one just like the Patriots did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and Im fucking serious. I almost have a feeling youre the only guy making all these antiBroncos topics because youre a faggot hater who doesnt like the team because theyre good. Fuck you be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking teams on the board like I give a fuck. Its so easy to spot out your threads now youre a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why dont you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. Thats just you youre always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.,Braveryjerk,cfyi8y3,1,t5_2tl1h

559637,0,t1_cg3rf6v,When I was in a pub in on Long Island I went to use the restrooms. When I was in the stall I saw writing on the door that said follow the arrows.I looked around but I didnt see any arrows. Whatever I didnt think about it.Then about a month after that Im back in the same place use the restroom to wash my hands before I tear into some buffalo wings.They were out of paper towels and not wanting to touch the restroom door with my hands I tried to open it with my elbows. This was a clumsy processes and resulted in my bumping a lightswitch with my elbow. The room went completely dark.Or did it?On the ceiling I notice a trail of glowinthedark arrows painted onto the ceiling. Theyre very very faded looks like theyd been there for quite a while. The lead out the door.Now I had totally forgotten about the graffiti I had read a month ago so I didnt really think about those arrows at all. I just pulled my sleeve over my wet hand used it to flip the switch back on and open the door.I went back to my table with some buddies and we chowed down on some excellent wings. It wasnt until the end of the evening when my brain out of nowhere remember the follow the arrows graffiti in the stall. I excuse myself from the table just to check that it was this stall where I saw the writing. It was. Now I had a mystery.I wanted to follow the arrows but I couldnt. After I left the restroom the ambient light was so bright that the arrows were invisible.I told my friends about the arrows and I asked the bartender about it. He knew about the graffiti but had never seen the glowinthedark arrows. After about  minutes of pouring drinks he took a minute to go check it out.He didnt seem that impressed. I asked him if we could stay after closing and turn off all the lights to see where it went. He said yes.Flash forward  hours. The bartender and some of the waitresses are all standing around in the dark of the bar looking at little faded arrows that make a trail from the restroom out to the front door.We step outside but the trail is dead. The streetlights outside make the faded glow in the dark arrows impossible to see if they were even there at all. days later Im in the Geology I at my college when I notice the display of exotic minerals that the department has in a display case. Inside the case is a small handheld black light used by rock hounds to find and observe glowinthedark minerals. After the class I ask the professor if I can borrow it. He says yes but that if I break it I owe the department .Flash forward  hours. I drag my buddies back to the bar. We have some more drinks and awesome buffalo wings. When were done gorging ourselves it is already dark outside.I went to the bathroom and tested my black light on some of the painted arrows. It worked like a charm they glowed incredibly brightly and even with the lights on they were fairly visible.I went back to the table. We pay our tab and step onto the street.My friends stood around me trying to look cool while I was geeking out with my black light searching for invisible arrows on the ground. I found one.I followed the arrow keeping my black light inches from the ground waving it back and forth...  feet away I found another arrow. Then another and another still.I was following these arrows down a side walk for about  blocks. My friends finally loosened up and started speculating on where the hell these arrows were taking us.Finally I got to an arrow pointing us in a new direction... it was a driveway leading to an empty commercial lot of some kind. The lot was surrounded by cyclone fences with aluminum siding we couldnt see what was inside.The arrows led us around the fencewall to a gate.I saw a lot of glowinthedark paint under my light and it took me a few seconds and some swinging of the light to realize we were looking at a giant arrow pointing inside the fence.I guess I should introduce you to my friends now One was Jeff one was Dave.Jeff pushed on the gate. It was locked and it rattled terribly in the dark. Dave looked uncomfortable. He took a deep breath and before he could say what Im certain he was about to hey guys lets just go home I cut him off I say we hop this baby.Jeff didnt even say anything before he leapt against the gate getting a firm handhold at the top. Ungracefully but successfully he pulled himself to an uncomfortable straddle on top of the gate.I followed suit leaping at the gate. I didnt reach the top on my first attempt. I put the black light in my pocket and took a running leap at the gate I got a firm handhold but I could fell the metal digging into my skin. I made a mental note to get a tetanus shot when this was all over.Jeff helped me up from the top while Dave pushed my legs from underneath. Dave followed next with surprising ease.From our perch on the gate we could see that the fence surrounded what looked like an old parking lot. Grass and other green things sprang up from the ancient crumbled asphalt.Immediately below us on the other side of the fence was nothing but inky blackness from the shadow cast by the gate from a nearby street lamp. I pulled my black light from my pocket but from this height it was useless.To my surprise Dave was the first one to slide down into the dark. He slide down the fence as low as possible before letting go and taking the final plunge. We heard him stumble curse quietly and the stand.Its okay he said I can see a little. Its just asphalt.,Braveryjerk,cg3vydg,2,t5_2tl1h

612634,0,t3_214hzd,The revolution is most definitely going to be televised. Theres going to be wave after wave of TV cameras all jockeying for a good angle a decent vantage point and the anchors are going to be sitting at their news desks Good evening ladies and gentlemen were bringing you live to frontlines of the revolution and all of the hippies are going to be sitting there in their plush leather recliners watching MSNBC on their sixtyseven inch plasmas holding their worn paperbacks in their hands But  but  but I thought that the revolution wasnt going to be televised. And hell look up at his bookshelf at the rest of his library his collection Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Repair nobody knows how to operate a motorcycle Steal This Book purchased for . from the sixtyfive percent off clearance rack at Barnes amp Noble Im sorry can you actually give me a different Barnes amp Noble tote bag? the memory flashes through of that particular transaction at the store Do you have any with Angela Lansburys face on it? but they didnt he had to settle for an Alex Trebek. It was probably still there somewhere buried under all of those receipts being saved the ones from Petland Discount Try shopping at Petland Discount! the circular read If you buy twelve jumbo bags of cat food the thirteethll be on us! which if you think about it thats actually a pretty significant savings what . a bag? Sure Purina is somewhat of a premium item but just think about all of they money you spend on your food on your dietary wellbeing those are the thoughts running through the heads of everybody picking out cat food and dog food. But try it try to save those receipts for a full twelve months because thats what it amounts to twelve bags twelve months roughly. And its not just the receipts its the proof of purchase its taking that giant empty catfood bag out of the giant plastic catfood bag dispenser that you bought to keep that dry catfood smell somewhat localized to one area of the kitchen. Have you seen the scissors? questioned lobbed out to no one in particular. Just dont use the kitchen scissors! the answer pointed straight back but where else upstairs? In the study? More clutter more receipts. And if you forget a month whatever thats just one month youll get to twelve months eventually youll get to twelve receipts twelve proofs of purchase you keep reassuring yourself Ill save that . eventually. But the neighbors mentioned something about Petco how they used to have a similar deal a similar means of maintaining its customer base free catfood keep coming back until they stopped. One day its twelve receipts twelve barcodes one free bag. Today not so much. How much longer until Petland Discount follows suit? So its upstairs to the study the homeoffice whatever you want to call that side room where the desktop computer sits forever turned on on top of that old desk warped in the middle from the weight of its now antique boxy monitor. Its always a challenge looking for the scissors for anything moving aside stacks of coupons for Gillette Fusion razors or free archery lessons coupons that surely must have expired by now try not to make too much more of a mess kicking up layer upon layer of old dust. Accidentally nudging that old mouse and the computer jolts awake how long was it asleep anyway? Ever since the wife bought that laptop which you were initially against and why? Why put up a fight over something that wound up making life a whole lot more convenient? You need to look something up on the computer? There it is no need to go upstairs. But why not get rid of this old machine? Sitting here eating up electricity bandwidth radiating heat sucking up time and energy. KaZaa still loaded on the screen although its unlikely that any data is being transferred to or fro. And look Steal This Album must have finished downloading sometime over the course of the past six years or so technically thats a success no money wasted on this  this music cd? Its not some sort of a revolutionary audiobook no its a heavy metal record System of a Down thats probably a little disappointing. Breaking News you can still hear from downstairs its MSNBC its Chris Matthews and hes tossing to a correspondent live from Egypt live from Tahrir Square Chris look at it this is the revolution! Its happing right now! right on TV right in front of the cameras pass the popcorn kick back and enjoy the show because the revolution is absolutely going to televised its going to be saved on our DVRs you can watch as much footage as you want on Youtube.

615823,0,t3_21724a,I live in a small valley in Monterey CA. Every house every morning has smoke chugging from chimneys and we burn wood in my house as well. As an atheist reading this article I got the feeling of an impending dread of what it would mean to change my view point on this topic I was honestly hoping he was making up points to drive an analogy home. It means the nice oak smelling mist I drive through to work every morning is  times worse than the remote puffs of smoke I try to dodge walking past smoking areas.The article probably has a specific heavy woodburning audience I doubt I would have been so impacted if I still lived in Florida. As for now living in this valley and being turned on to the danger of the cloud we live in it is fairly alarming. Especially considering my wife is the one who enjoys the fireplace the most and she is not as rational strictly speaking as I am.In the end because I do put stock in the scientific method I am forced to face that what I thought was mostly benign and pleasant is now posing a danger to my family.The analogy strikes true with me.,Braveryjerk,cga9qrs,1,t5_2tl1h

When I heard about the Rift there was this moment of oh thats right. There are still things I want out of life things Ive forgotten I loved. Ive since sobered up started teaching myself algebra and watched computer science courses and different D modeling program tutorials on Youtube. And really sincerely Im happier now than I have been in a long time because Ive been given a goal. Whatever comes of it Ill always credit Palmer Luckey for reigniting my passion for what has always been my favorite artistic medium. But this is too gross. Facebook is an organization that to me represents every negative aspect of the online experience and while I still expect Oculus will turn out a fine product Ill be debating my options much more thoroughly.,Braveryjerk,chfs3ap,2,t5_2tl1h
986396,0,t1_chgawpb,Do you think you know memes huh? You think youre some kind of meme critic? Geniuses are never recognized in their own time. Look at van Gogh. People laughed at him in his lifetime and now he is regarded as one of the greatest painters of all time. People will recognize the beauty of Blader Bobby at some point and then they will be pointing at YOU and laughing at YOU. Youll see. This meme is about a man who is deep down a blader. He doesnt care about upvotes and downvotes default subreddits or subreddit drama. He just wants to feel the concrete as it rushes beneath his blades. He wants to feel the wind through his hair. Feel the sweat accumulate beneath his custom kneepads. He just wants to blade. I guess the meme is truly about a mans devotion to his craft and through this theme the meme investigates the materialism of our society. Ugh Im sick of PC gamers and their stupid attitude. Just because youre a  year old virgin who likes playing stupid games alone in your moms basement doesnt make you better than me it makes you worse. Im only  and I get more pussy in a week than you have your entire lives. Im also a real gamer you fags I have ps and xbox  and Im ranked in ghosts and blops . Seriously stop this fucking bullshit.

1085561,0,t3_26j6lx,This will probably get buried but here goes nothing.I went clubbing with a friend last night. This club wasnt your ordinary club this one was different. As we entered men with the crispest neck beards and astonishing fedoras were everywhere. Woman with MLP shirts were treating the men like gods notice gods and not God since he doesnt exist? and to our left a sign stating no friend zoning allowed. Our hearts began to race and I knew it was time to show the madams of the beautiful palace what a gentlemen I am.Walking in with my Bill Murray shirt euphoric fedora and newly trimmed neckbeard everyone was looking at me breathlessly as if I was about to slay the dragon of whom was keeping my lover prisoner inside her castle. I saw a dim lighting stage as the music of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin played through my ears. I got on stage to where I shouted I am a god hater gay supporter and a science lover. The club filled with cheering and claps that could be heard at the Liberal Activist building across the street.I proceeded to walk down from the stage where beautiful woman attached on to me like fish do to sharks. They begged to come home with me to my moms basement. I felt like a warrior shining through is armor standing on top of the dragon I have slayed I was a dragon slayer.I called my mom to pick my friend and I up with an astonishing amount of ladies. I cooked up some hot pockets and served us all a pint of Mountain Dew. After consuming the meal of champions we all got our groovyness on. While this room was getting heated and I have finally lost my virginity I wanted to get kinky and do a favor for one of mladys. One of the girls suggested I lick her fece hole. I took it into consideration and started. Licking away she moaned louder than a thousand ponies on a castle. Unfortunately since we had recently consumed hot pockets our stomachs werent at out best support. The lady whom I was tongue tickling released molten lava of left over hot pocket niblets on my face. I backed up from the lava and figured out a strategy to overcome this obstacle. I equipped my armor and great sword to slay the lava beast. The women began to get embarrass of what had happen to where I said dont worry mlady I will survive through the struggles of this battle. Surprisingly enough she was erotically turned on from what I had said and let me lick it all up clean.This is the story of how I got my username.,Braveryjerk,chroia5,5,t5_2tl1h

1161386,0,t3_27evgm,I am a yearold single mom. My son turns  in February. I fantasize about eating him cooked or raw almost every day. In all my life Ive never had a more satisfying more intense more arousing recurring fantasy. The thought of my teeth piercing his flesh or the smell of him roasting over an open flame or imagining the look in his eyes as I bite into one of his thighs ... these things absolutely drive me wild. I think about eating my son to help me masturbate and to have better sex with other people though I cant say I blame you for making that assumption. Eating my son is my goto fantasy my guaranteedtogetmeoff piece of makebelieve. That said I have absolutely no intention of butchering and devouring him in his sleep or anything like that. For one my fantasies are often more involved. But more than that eating him is my fantasy and I can distinguish fantasy from reality. Still if my son came up to me right now and said Mom I know this sounds weird but I want to be your next meal would you please cook and eat me? I absolutely would. My son doesnt know that I fantasize about eating him. He doesnt know that my mouth literally waters when I look at photos of him at the beach or see him by the pool. He doesnt know how turned on he makes me when we watch The Walking Dead together and he rests his head on my belly. I want to tell him but I also want him to feel safe around me not be afraid that I only see him as meat. Ive worked hard to give him as comfortable supportive and even boring a life as I can and knowing that your mom gets off thinking about eating you would ruin that for almost anyone. And part of me still wants to tell him just so he knows everything. And so that maybe however unlikely he could be interested and might ask. For now I dont plan on telling him until hes at least  or he asks directly. I want him to go off to college and have his own experiences and life before I introduce any sexual elements into our relationship. Id be lying if I said I didnt hope he brought them up on his own however ...,Braveryjerk,ci09w0k,3,t5_2tl1h

As a murican I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin I know that feel bro and while that was a risky click this post was a  would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. Youre doing Gods work son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You  I like you. You magnificent bastard you sir are so brave a gentleman and a scholar and seeing how you are a redditor for  years this checks out so Ill allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story bro. CTRLF about tree fiddy was not disappointed. Wait why do I have you tagged as NOPE NOPE NOPE? Nice try you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as YOU HAD ONE JOB. I cant fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit so Ill see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science so thats enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little manpeach  would not bang. What is this I dont even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it theyll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism.

2142938,0,t3_2jgasz,rbraveryjerk is actually a very complex place if you truly look at it. At first when you come to rbraveryjerk it comes across as extremely autistic and retarded filled with nothing but shitty unfunny repeated forced memes. However if you actually try to look into the culture of the subreddit stay around for a while you will find that there is actually a very subtle and complex language between the users and it the pattern of the sub as a whole. Try to participate in the culture of these supposedly shitty and repetitive posts and then observe the comments you recieve. If you look deeply enough into what at first appears to only be a stream of mindless Ks Nice memes and stale copypastas you may notice that they form a deeper more sophisticated atmosphere of a unique brand of humor. If you truly participate in the subs culture try to learn it immerse yourself in it understand the complex subtleties of the unique humor you will find that it is a thousand times more autistic and unfunny that you initially believed.,Braveryjerk,clc7rmx,1,t5_2tl1h

4399938,0,t3_3bf8hv,The whole euphoric fedoraclad neckbeard thing has become a way of saying A redditor with whom I disagree or An atheist who announces himself as such.Its a caricature of hopelessly nerdy and cynical basement dwellers who spend their days either engaging in internet debate or playing MMOs. They are described as unhygienic lazy angry insufferable narcissistic pedants who have no idea how to dress themselves thus often appearing in public wearing cargo shorts a tshirt referencing Schrodingers Cat and of course..the ubiquitous Fedora which is actually a Trilby but we stick with fedora so the insufferable narcissistic pedants on this website will have something to chew on. They also have trouble shaving their neck either because of persistent acne or because they just dont care.The caricature also pits them as having a massive illusorysuperiority complex. They are the type of person who describes themselves as genius but has never actually achieved anything. The excuse is either Lack of motivation or if they are utterly incapable of internalizing failure Lack of stimulation.But as with any joke its outgrown the caricature and is now thrown around to the point at which it has no more meaning that the colloquial use of the word retard. Its an insult to be sure but what it actually means will always vary by the context of the usage.That said if youre like to summon this insult simply describe yourself as not believing in a god or question the logic of religious people anywhere outside of ratheism. Within  minutes you will have no less than  references to your fedora your neckbeard and your euphoria.,Braveryjerk,csllvpk,3,t5_2tl1h

7862750,0,t1_d3zu7xr,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d3zuepm,1,t5_2tl1h

For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d3zxrv2,1,t5_2tl1h

7865278,0,t1_d404neq,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d404o7d,1,t5_2tl1h

7866581,0,t1_d409w5k,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far.

7868034,0,t1_d40fpcr,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that.

In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist.

Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d40lx5q,1,t5_2tl1h
7869556,0,t1_d40lx5q,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness.

I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d40mzy3,1,t5_2tl1h
7869833,0,t1_d40n427,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d40o5ar,1,t5_2tl1h

In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech.

Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him.

Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d40or7y,1,t5_2tl1h

7870267,0,t1_d40ov61,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things.

I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d40pz9b,1,t5_2tl1h

7870823,0,t1_d40qzsj,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories.

And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d41l9jl,1,t5_2tl1h
7878446,0,t1_d41lvoc,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there.

Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d41r8ib,1,t5_2tl1h
7879811,0,t1_d41rh0t,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far.

7880624,0,t1_d41unza,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist.

And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

7880732,0,t1_d41v56a,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community.

At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d41vpi3,1,t5_2tl1h

In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ.

Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things.

I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,Braveryjerk,d41vvhm,1,t5_2tl1h

Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things.

That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

7881030,0,t1_d41wfja,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities.
