11585746,0,t3_65bvlr,Ive heard of this issue. Theres a bunch of solutions to this problem.One solution is to create a file named player.ini in your Syberia folder with the contents        BaseCMO.cmo Another solution is to disable Steam Community for Syberia and run it in Windows XP mode.I cant tell you why it happens. I played the game on Windows XP Windows  and just recently Windows  all without any problems. Hopefully the solutions above will solve the problem for you.,syberia,dg992ao,2,t5_2zcwk
11690534,0,t1_dgl468q,I got stuck in the ground later in the game which forced me to load the last checkpoint. I got stuck at the start of the game where one of those move the items to the side to find the item which lies under them puzzles and  of the big items clipped in the walls. Also the only option to load the last save point. The missing inventory item was the most frustrating thing because i knew what i needed for the puzzle and that i took it already. It was neither at the puzzle itself already nor at the place where you have to take it. So i had to load the last checkpoint. The problem i just have is that many parts take so much walking later on in the game that loading a checkpoint means at least  minutes of walking to get the puzzle pieces back again. Manual saving would have been a great feature but would have made a few conversations even more simple. ,syberia,dgl51sd,1,t5_2zcwk
