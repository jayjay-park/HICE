Generally the Dothraki costume is the most recognizable and pretty simple and inexpensive to sew. You can get a Targaryen sigil pin here If its in your budget violet contacts are true to the book. You could either DIY or buy a dragon egg to carry or buy one of these Hope this helps!,costumeideas,cvq0x9o,2,t5_2sv47
