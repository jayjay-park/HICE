2488469,0,t3_2o35vg,Are you using end papers? If you havent taken your Cosmo test get the end paper dispenser. Its like a mini kleenax box and saves so much time. . Are you matching the size of the rod with the size of your part?. Are you spritzing the hair? . You may may want to experiment with different end wrap techniques. Ive had better luck with the double end paper or as I call it the sandwich with the bottom paper just sticking out a little. Is it just the smallness of the rods? I used to joke with my fellow students clients and tell them to ask for the red rods which are the diameter of  toothpicks put together. That is going to come back to haunt me one day. ,Cosmetology,cmjdqap,2,t5_2stk8
4428211,0,t3_39mdoo,If at all possible try and ask the students how they feel about the school. Im a PM alumna and I absolutely HATED my school and majority of the staff. Most of them didnt know what they were talking about and had their heads so far up their asses. They brainwashed the new students CoreampampampProtege to LOVE PM and allow you to ask them how they like the school on your tour but most of them didnt understand that when you go to the floor shit hit the fan. Also I didnt learn jack shit from that school. But I went to Caper which is an event in Vegas for all PM schools and apparently a bunch of other students loved their school. So maybe it was just mine. TLDR Ask students who are working on the floor how they feel about the school to get the real inside scoop on it. ,Cosmetology,csov7ez,2,t5_2stk8

11775893,0,t3_6805xc,Getting a cosmetology license is the way to go in my opinion. Regardless of which statecountry youre in it really shouldnt take long at all. Maybe  years at most. Having that certification will give you an edge over other makeup artists. It will be hard work and cosmetology is mostly focused on hair yes but not only will you have a great certification but youll also be able to fall back on your license if makeup doesnt work outyou decide you like doing hair better. Look into ROP programs now and see what you can do while still in high school. Even if you cant start until after high school keep in mind that its one of the shortest programs you can graduate from and make a decent living off of. Additionally if you want to add a makeup course many cosmetology schools offer such classes. Becoming an esthetician may work better for you however its really up to your discretion. Deciding whether you would like to fall back on skincare and facials or hair plus deciding how long you want to be in school will help you make that decision.   On a personal note I started out just like you wanting to focus almost solely on makeup. I had no idea how to blow dry someones hair let alone color bleach or cut it. Now Im about to have a job interview tomorrow at a great hair salon. While I love makeup just as much as I did before school I know now how profitable and enjoyable cosmetology as a whole can be. I graduate cosmetology school in just a few weeks. I would honestly encourage you to see where this career takes you. Youll meet great people and experience a lot of cool things! I think its totally worth it both money and time. Good luck!! ,Cosmetology,dguu0ni,3,t5_2stk8
