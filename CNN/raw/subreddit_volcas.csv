5792939,0,t3_3uipno,Given the success of the series I would be surprised if they didnt add to the family or start a Volca  line.Or maybe a combo unit thats all the Volcas rolled into one Electribe style? That could be really cool.,volcas,cxf6340,6,t5_2ypvb
6045331,0,t1_cybq9wd,And if having dangling wires bothers you as much as it bothers me maybe try grab a behringer micro mix.   bucks and youll get separate level controls and a much cleaner setup not to mention its the kind of thing thats just good to have around.,volcas,cyc1sqe,1,t5_2ypvb
6221918,0,t1_cywusdz,Youre not really asking for reviews though. Youre asking can x do y is this synth better than another or how do I do xyz. The best way to get a feel for a synth before you purchase it is to watch youtube videos and see what other people are doing with it. That said I did check out one of your recent pieces and it was nice. Keep up the good work. But a big part of being a musicianartist is to experiment with things. If you get a piece of gear and decide you dont like it or that it doesnt suit you you can always flip it and get something else.,volcas,cywv52r,1,t5_2ypvb

6396275,0,t1_czgnhil,For the Volcas here are what they are and do. From what youve said it sounds like this is going to be a big kids toy at first at least! so Ive written about them from that angle.Beats Drum machine. Some analogue parts and some digital parts the analogue parts can be tweaked a lot but the digital parts can only have their speed altered. Stutter can be used to add a delay like effect.Sonic Lab Bass Focuses on bass sounds but works perfectly well in the higher notes too. Three separate oscillators means you can play chords with it or sequence three different note sequences to play at the same time. You can also group voices together. Each oscillator can be tuned separately so you can create cool harmony and unison effects. The filter is bad ass and sounds great.Sonic Lab Sample Only one Ive not used personally. This machine lets you import your own audio clips for use in your projects. It comes loaded with samples too so you can use it as a drum machine with some extra effects right out of the box.Sonic Lab Keys This is focused on lead and chord sounds higher than bass sounds basically It does a lot of stuff and you get a lot of synth for your money. For this one youre better off watching the video as while it doesnt do anything remarkable it does everything youd reasonably expect for a machine more than twice its price. Its just a really good synthesizer.Sonic Lab ,volcas,czgovir,2,t5_2ypvb
6403606,0,t1_czhirxo,The details are here Notably you also get access to a step sequence on the synth part. The Sample and Hold takes the cake for me though I barely use other LFO shapes anymore actually.,volcas,czhiwmo,1,t5_2ypvb

8846884,0,t3_51d0mf,Check what other programs you have running on your laptop. I had this same problem and it turned out it was because Spotify was running in the background. Make sure you shut down everything thats running and can potentially disrupt the audio.,volcas,d7b9q7f,2,t5_2ypvb

10332744,0,t3_5nytha,Yeah it is a bit of an eyesore being the OKGO one but for  dollars and free  day shipping for prime members now seems to be the right time to try a Volca! This will be my first Volca and piece of hardware I ever owned. Coming in tomorrow im very excited,volcas,dcf9vjv,1,t5_2ypvb
10426937,0,t1_dcpe388,because now the cable has a d printed end to house the processor maybe they miscalculated maybe they find that this is a more adecuate price tag or maybe they only want to get rich thing that I doubt no hard feelingsyeah dont worry we are talking Im not taking this personal for being a buyer or something hehe I can perfectly understand your way of thinkingyes look this source a midi traductor is a relative eaasy thing not that compact like rk but eh good for most people with a home studio.this is a example of a diy midi traductor  I dont even know if this is the correct name haha this is designed to do in the kaossilator pro the same thing that rk possibly less functionality since this is not mantained much but it works,volcas,dcpyn4d,2,t5_2ypvb

11044140,0,t1_dej66h2,trigger box is an ios app yes. it can send independent leftampright channel sync so with the right cable you can feed different signals to the Volcas. I think a korg sq might be able to do the same via AB channel,volcas,deju18a,1,t5_2ypvb

11447300,0,t1_dfsra5i,Try makinglayering your own kicks. That way you dont have to search a lot. You just make the kicks you like. The Sample can be pretty punchy sounding I think. And it is also really cool for looping endless decay trick and for making crazy fx. Try loading up some white noise vocalsample or foley recording loop it and tweak automate some knobs. Thats what it does best I think.,volcas,dftji7t,1,t5_2ypvb
