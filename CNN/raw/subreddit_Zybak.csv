Whichever you like best. You could get the ryno and stuff get some sweet weapons and armor etc...,Zybak,cf1ben8,2,t5_2zd1r
262720,0,t3_1x317x,You cant tell if someone is anorexic by their weight. I think this woman is now underweight depending on what charts you follow but shes not dangerously thin and Im pretty sure the show although I dont watch it so I may be wrong tried to teach healthy eating rather than starvation. If shes getting the nutrients she needs to survive and is maintaining this body weight then good on her. Anorexia is an eating disorder and whether you believe it is a disorder or just a behavior pattern or whatever else it is still classified by a set of behaviors and not by a persons body type. Again I believe this to me true...  minutes of research may be able to prove me completely wrong... But Im pretty sure you can have a lb woman who is anorexic because it is a behavior. Im not saying shed be lbs for long but you know...,Zybak,cf7zne6,2,t5_2zd1r
