7834082,0,t1_d3wm6yu,I think there are more than  maf  look at how many unsuccessful kills there were on ks spreadsheet.There are no townspeople. The roles were all made up and given a percentage of possibility to kill so no one suspected anything. Thats also why roles arent being revealed.All of us died because people thought we were innocent. Thats the weirdest part. There wasnt a single vote yesterday where the person thought they were voting against someone guilty.This is great. All hail marxr.,HogwartsGhosts,d3wma8u,3,t5_3cm1u
7837587,0,t1_d3x00hu,If there are  deaths again tomorrow  probably pretty soon. A lot of people have already started wondering why there were so many victims and some were making jokes that everyone is Mafia. The idea is already there they just have to put two and two together. I am curious what would happen then  will they say something on the main thread? Will they figure out that other people are Sideshow Bob as well? Will everyone just keep their suspicion to themselves hoping the others havent realized whats happening? It will be so much fun to watch if we end up with a group of  people all pretending they dont know whats going on ,HogwartsGhosts,d3x0gcs,4,t5_3cm1u

7946086,0,t1_d48z9fs,If she claims an important role the Mafias will kill her for sure. She might stand a better chance if she claims normal villager except there is no such role on the list or better  nothing. I guess it depends on how many people have already voted  if almost everyone has already cast their vote for someone else she might live long enough to be killed by a Mafia tomorrow...,HogwartsGhosts,d497qf8,6,t5_3cm1u
7948256,0,t1_d49gbp3,I have to think that all of the conversations are happening in the private sub. If not everyone must be playing very boring or individualized games which could be the case due to the fact that everyone is Bob. The last game went  cycles or something like that so this seems on track with that. I want a new game to start but I wont be playing next month! I have to wait until August.... Im trying to show a little selfcontrol considering the bar exam is at the end of July!,HogwartsGhosts,d49giz6,4,t5_3cm1u

10219219,0,t1_dc2edtg,Most unfortunate. I feel like you myself and uohmamori would have made a solid leadership core and I certainly cant fault the villains for taking us out. But yeah without direction its not gonna go to well for the regular castaways. But if everyone stays quiet it might make it harder for the villains to pick their targets. Im interested to see how its going to pan out.,HogwartsGhosts,dc2emmp,11,t5_3cm1u

10251876,0,t1_dc63o57,Yeah we did. They almost split the vote to try and get out mimosas as a backup but I pointed out that it could lead to me getting voted off by the villains so was a terrible idea. Hopefully theyll make a sensible choice tonight but going by their previous track record it doesnt look likely.,HogwartsGhosts,dc63ucf,5,t5_3cm1u

10705369,0,t1_ddk6a59,I actually dont think town voted for me. I realized a bit too late that with the KorsolaIcetoa thing people would all be voting for Korsola. Im like  certain shes actually Jessica so Trevor would use his ability on her. If raccoons and librarians voted for me I would then be the person with the highest vote total. I said something to that effect in one of my last posts but with uMathy dead it wouldnt really matter. There wouldnt be a way to convey that info to the main sub. ,HogwartsGhosts,ddk6ggv,3,t5_3cm1u
