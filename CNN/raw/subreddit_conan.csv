7939500,0,t3_4nzh40,I personally felt Conan expressed what most of us feel. I mean I get it. Everyone believes that they are moral and just and therefore should have the right to own these types of weapons and that it is a fundamental right. It is not. These weapons are built for one purpose. If any of those people killed were your neighbour your friend or a family member would you consider giving up that right if it meant saving their life? No? Probably because you believe having such a weapon could save them if you were there. A valid argument but has anyone ever been saved by a fully automatic weapon owned by a civilian? It doesnt change anything because these things happen fast and they end fast. Its the same type of thinking that puts powerful weapons in everyones hands and hope for the best.,conan,d48h39h,12,t5_2qzg7
7948049,0,t1_d48mcre,A tool is any instrument of manual operation. A computer vacuum pencil car phone gun sword chainsaw chair rope math lightbulbs rocks etc... are all tools. Weapons are tools. ,conan,d49fos9,1,t5_2qzg7

11001968,0,t1_deegzou,In general I enjoy travel shows and the format combined with humor has worked for bits of Jackass the entirety of Wildboyz An Idiot Abroad that one show with Sean Locke and Jon Richardson and Stephen Frys travel shows. Everyone loves travel or vacation and messing around. Watching other people do it on TV is the next best thing.,conan,def1hdw,3,t5_2qzg7

Conan and Jordan went there separately on vacation although this isnt the first time Jordan has run into Conan on vacation so maybe Jordan has a crush on the ol bossman. Not sure where were going for our next travel show but there are a few possibilities floating around and they all sound exciting! Staaaay tuuuuned...,conan,dfpjilu,42,t5_2qzg7
