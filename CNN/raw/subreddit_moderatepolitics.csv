The greater prominencepowerdeciding nature of primaries is coming at the expense of the actual elections.  Adding more voters to the primary adds to the problem by encouraging either or voting.

If you look at things like GDP per capita Russia is terrible compared to a typical Western European country. China does worse on GDP per capita. Mind you China makes stuff and exports it. It imports a lot of stuff too. Its developing a middle class. Nothing Putin has done has moved Russia in that direction. In fact he seems to be moving towards hostility with the West and protectionism. Also Putins regime is authoritarian and nationalist and controls the media. Its cheaper to feed people propaganda on state TV than to work out how to do well timed subsidies. Of course economically this sort of thing is disastrous.gt its not like this is a permanent protective tariff.Right now it wouldnt surprise me if the long term effect of the annexation of Crimea is that Russia moves off to  its own version economic autarky If Putin decides to invade Eastern Ukraine  and Im not convinced hes that dumb  then its pretty much the only option he has. ,moderatepolitics,cjk6012,1,t5_2s6h3

That is kind of an entertaining side bonus.gtSo then the fault of the insurance company and not the ACA. Not really. The relevant portion of the article that answers your question is heregtBut other problems may be related to the process by which the plans are created. Under the Affordable Care Act each state was asked to select a benchmark plan as its standard. It had to cover certain essential health benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs it had to have a defined actuarial value depending on the level of plan. Silver plans for example had to cover  percent of charges leaving consumers with  percent. But within those parameters competing insurers had leeway to set premiums copayments and deductibles and to create networks by negotiating with doctors and hospitals. Naturally they created policies that met the core criteria while minimizing their financial risk.gtSuddenly there were hundreds of new insurance products that had never been tested in real time.

I dont pay much attention to people who talk like this and I dont think its fair to equate some peoples view of the party as the driving force behind not attracting minority support.gtWhat kind of drastic change do you think would appeal?I think if the GOP were to drop their stance on social issues theyd be a lot more popular with the youth. I also think their strategy of appeasing the religious right by denying scientific consensus global warming evolution etc is only driving away people who arent religious conservatives.

Fiorina is very fiscally conservative she offers no diversity to his campaign to try to attract different voters..  She is not well liked.  She has a terrible record with HP but that not withstanding she did not do well in the primaries... when she got out she had been polling around  for a while and near the end she was around .  She really doesnt bring much of a following..  She has no delegates.  At all.  Unlike Rubio Cruz Carson... all who are possibly good choices shes bringing absolutely no delegates with her..  She eliminates a lot of his bargaining power at the convention.  In order to pick up delegates or a following one of his big bargaining chips will be to offer someone a running mate situation that possibility is now gone.Other than the fact that he shows diversity by bringing on a female running mate there are virtually no upsides to this move.Trump loves this.  If things get tight he will end up making a deal with Marco Rubio remember... delegates this is all about delegates at this point.  Now he doesnt have to worry that Cruz will beat him to it.  Trump will not be following suit.. there is no point for him to do that at this time.I couldnt think of a stupider thing for Cruz to do or a worse time.

Its not just the GOP.  An independent federal audit by the Inspector General corroborates info in the article.  It might be hurting ourselves if we simply generalize that all news is tainted.  We  have to decide how reliable each source is on its own merits.  For instance the independent audit is allowed full access to research and document what transpired giving it more credibility than a news piece from a small local station.  In regards to the audit the Inspector General concludes the following gtThe page analysis a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press says Clinton ignored clear directives. She never sought approval to conduct government business over private email and never demonstrated the server or the Blackberry she used while in office met minimum information security requirements.gtTwice in  information management staff at the State Department raised concerns that Clintons email practices failed to meet federal recordskeeping requirements. The staffs director responded that Clintons personal email system had been reviewed and approved by legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further.gtThe audit found no evidence of a legal staff review or approval. It said any such request would have been denied by senior information officers because of security risks.,moderatepolitics,d4dviz9,0,t5_2s6h3

10744743,0,t3_5tmpt1,Its not short but heres the upshot of this great articlegt The fundamental liberal philosophical underpinning of viewpoint neutrality which Altman failed to observe in dismantling it was that of the infallibility of humanity. By attempting to pick up the impossibly heavy reins of absolute truth and label some ideas hateful and therefore worthy of censorship he unwittingly departs from the recognition of his own infallibility. gt The salient point here is that even if he happens to be righteven if those ideologies are all fundamentally flawed and terriblehe was still wrong in trying to censor them. He was wrong in thinking that he could draw boundaries around the marketplace of ideas.   The marketplace only works because there are no boundaries and any outlier will inevitably be brought back towards the mean in the aggregate. gt To censor the speech of those with hateful ideologies might be a tangible proposal but to censor their thoughts is fundamentally impossible. For that reason to censor them only serves to kick them out of the marketplace altogether and the marketplaces integrity is dependent upon universal participation. If those who hate are forced out of the common market and relegated to some other space eventually they will find their own markets in which they will fester and reproduce spawning new and evolved forms of hatred possible only as the result of an artificial incubation.   gt In the meantime the original marketplace will have become philosophically hollowed out as a result of not having had to refute aberrant hateful ideologies and therefore hone its own best understanding of truth in a neverending pluralistic exchange of information. Eventually those incubated hateful ideologies will inevitably clash with the dead dogma and corrupted remains of the original marketplace resulting in their inevitable reconciliation however ugly the clash might be. That is the true danger ignored by the wellintentioned selfrighteous academics who fail to see just how selfdefeating such censorship can be in the long term.,moderatepolitics,ddo8ls2,8,t5_2s6h3
