1946686,0,t1_cknrmmq,I downloaded Aptoide APK from here Version ... works without crashing!Bad news I dont think an installer INSIDE the VM is going to work. I think Google did not include this functionality.  There is something previously unknown about how the outside APK can be run directly by the launcher without any extra code to unpack and use it.,chromeapks,ckns0lk,1,t5_33lso
