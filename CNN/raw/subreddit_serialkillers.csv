87723,0,t1_ceoanq3,The abdominal walls were divided in the middle line to within a quarter of an inch of the navel. The cut then took a horizontal course for two inches and a half towards the right side. It then divided round the navel on the left side and made a parallel incision to the former horizontal incision leaving the navel on a tongue of skin. Attached to the navel was two and a half inches of the lower part of the rectus muscle on the left side of the abdomen. The incision then took an oblique direction to the right and was shelving. The incision went down the right side of the vagina and rectum for half an inch behind the rectum.

Perhaps she never truly felt SHE was a real part of the family yet she could see the pets were and so she hurt and killed them out of rage and jealousy with the added bonus of hurting the people who adopted her by hurting their real family?  Then again maybe the family pets were chosen just because they were around at the time she had the impulse trusted her and made an easy target?   Or maybe she DID love the family pets and it terrified her on some level because everything she had loved up to that point had rejected her?  First her birth parents rejected her and now even her adopted parents reject her...she must feel so alone angry and misunderstood.

4947718,0,t1_cui5e9k,I would agree. Serial killers are supposed to be extremely calculating and exact. If this killer was so obsessed with documenting his victims I doubt he would want to miss out on getting pictures of them when they were alive. Unless they didnt really care about it at all which would not really fit. That just leads me to believe that this is a load of crap just some role playing game with a player or players that are simply desperate to be a part of something and have attention. While extremely disconcerting at first view I think the person who created this is likely not a killer at all. Just some sick idiot that got ahold of pictures of horrible things that happened to other peoples loved ones.

A group of  year olds were arrested after using a sling shot to shoot rocks at cars when the whole thing was happening.  No one died thankfully but it was still unnerving the few times I had to use the freeway during that two week span. Im still worried about copy cats but nothing has happened since the guy was caught. Edit and yes it is absolutely horrifying when its happening in basically your backyard. It adds a whole new level to it.

I took pains to develop a plausible story that enabled me to simply walk away from the k tax fraud k student loans wiped have no assets seized reduce my child support to  per week retain  care of my children not have to work for the entire period of bankruptcyHalfway through i have state funded compensation of  per week  and have k which i have tucked away. There is zero evidence of any drug related crime fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud. I have never been arrested or charged with any crime ever and aside from the one time  min questioning i have never been investigated for any financial wrong doing or criminal behaviour.  My partner was able walk away from the relationship with no effect financially keep two houses and have k cash. She still thinks I only owed  and was an occasional pot smoker. The story has not come without complications but are so inconsequential that they are irrelevant. It was based around using specific legal mechanisms and state policy that required zero evidence and filling out two forms and no involvement of a third partyexcept a visit to a doctortotal time developing it was about  hours  and approximate time from initiation to completion will be about  hours of follow up over a three year period.The monetary benefit for all my actions is quite small but i have money to establish myself post bankruptcy no debt  i live alone in a two bedroom apartment i will be available for my kids entire childhood i dont have to work the state absorbed all debt and pay me to live i spend my time gardening reading about psychology criminology profiling and volunteer occasionally on a suicide hotline.

Most of them have a common history of some sort of abuse lots have have head trauma accidents earlier in life so that can be interesting to see what abuses correlate with which offenses. Then there are the big cases like Dahmer Bundy and Gacy that are so incredibly twisted beyond just murdering some people. With those cases the entire everything is interesting to me. There are cases that are very psychologically interesting and there really isnt much of an investigation to read about like Dean Corll.

6566303,0,t3_45hn75,The Zodiac Killer was a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan and referenced their opera The Mikado in his letters to the cops amp SF newspapers. And the Zodiac was inspired by the character of Count Zaroff in the short story and film The Most Dangerous Game which features a mad genius type  highcultured posh but lusting for blood. Those are just two popular cultural images associated with serial killing that have endured.  I think thats honestly part of where that particular trope comes from. Also for a long time there have been depictions of evil genius murderers in literature movies etc. think for instance of the image of Ming the Merciless in the old Flash Gordon serials bald mustachioed brilliant has a British accent. Because of decades  even centuries  of being told that evil is going to look and speak a certain way we internalize those tropes and begin to expect brutal sociopathic  serial killers to be brilliant twisted scheming geniuses.

Now does the DNA evidence exonerate him of all the murders hes been accused of? Well no. The dog hair mitochondrial dna found on one adult victim was very similar to his dogs and human hair dna found on another victim dont rule him out for that one either. I believe  from what Ive read in the Internet that he was involved in murders of several young men and because of that he was simply assumed to be the killer of all those boys simply because it was convenient.

8876181,0,t3_51raqm,Cool another thread where there are probably lots of good answers but one clear winner  Israel Keyes.The FBI openly admits it has no firm estimate of the number of Keyes victims. His victims were random unknown to him often out of state were often transported across state lines to be killed and then often buried in another state entirely or at least an unknown location in relation to the murder.Keyes would fly from the PNW USA to other parts of the country rent a car with unlimited miles and drive multiple states over to find a vulnerable victim. We dont know but highly suspect that he did this with a woman from NJ. He likely killed her in NY and buried her in a reservoir in upstate NY. He would take the battery out of his phone and pay cash the entire trip. The FBI can only give vague geographic areas for the times he was active. Most of his victims arent known by him and will never be found by police. He stated in his jailhouse interviews that one of his previous victims had been discovered and the death ruled an accident by authorities. He only was caught because he got extremely sloppy with his final victim police were not even aware that a serial killer existed in his case. Not a single one of his murders had been solved had any leads or was ever connected to another. ,serialkillers,d7esikj,7,t5_2s9td

9771468,0,t3_5f36oz,Oh for sure it did. Heres a personal story I dont get murdered in it. It was my boyfriends rd birthday week. He was going out every night which I mostly didnt join in because I was working two jobs but it was all cool. Well one night he comes home only hes black out drunk. Usually when he comes home drunk which isnt really all that often he just wakes me up and tells me he loves me and is just kind of sweetly annoying. Well this time he was black out drunk. He comes home and does his usual thing what ever I go back to bed. He goes down stairs and then comes back up and drags me out of bed and starts wailing on me after he throws me across the room and over a chair. He is screaming saying I fucked up his radio and it just all goes down hill pretty bad. So Im doing a fairly decent job of fending him off but then he starts breaking mirrors and vases and plates and is just a human fucking hurricane. He starts throwing stainless steal puts and pans at me as hard as he can so I run outside and call . Hes also throwing out my stuff computer clothes guitar. So the cops get there and I tell them what happened. They go inside to talk to him. When they come back they ask to see my arms and legs. Im a little dischevelled but not really many visible marks. Apparent she cut himself by accident when he was breaking all that stuff. They looked at me I was  at the time looked at the nice house and all the damage and told me they thought I was the aggressors because of the cuts and apparently he said I had beaten him up. I spent the weekend in jail and the next month sleeping on friends floors until I got my own place. Oh and I found out later that the cops were asking my ex things like does he pick fights with you a lot? Is he aggressive? Who is he in relation to you? Has he maybe been over staying his welcome? We had been together for  years but yeah Im feeling very unwelcome. Cops are dicks. And the amount of antagonism from them is insane while youre in jail.

10697201,0,t3_5rs3rs,The Weather Underground Bill Ayers amp pals were domestic terrorists who declared war on the US government and committed murders amp various other violent crimes in conjunction with the Black Liberation Army which was an avowed racist group. There was a lot of political rhetoric involved plus its tough to present WU as racially motivated murders since they were mostly white folk. But since WU joined forces with a minority group that was outspoken about hating whites to kill people I think both groups technically qualify. Even if a black person decides that someone is an uncle Tom or a white person hates someone because they think heshe has white privilege its still a racially motivated hate crime to kill those victims.,serialkillers,ddjc4qo,1,t5_2s9td

10879682,0,t3_5vh631,I remember being a child and watching every scary movie I could find online or on OnDemand.. Was basically raised by the internet with much emotional coldness from my parents not a lot of attention. Good home life as far as finances but not much going as far as emotion or support. I feel sometimes as though I was raised partially by these killers through my screen. Truly feels like something I have loved and been interested in my entire life as long as I can remember. I am  now and more passionate about my curiosities than ever and it just keeps growing. I would say for me this started around age  though I remember being interested in various things of darker nature at even younger ages.,serialkillers,de25tvu,3,t5_2s9td

In Kingston Pen about five years ago Richard Wills had to be moved to a new prison because of behavior that was disturbing and depressing those were the words news articles at the time used to fellow inmates Paul Bernardo and Russell Williams. I have never found a news source that said exactly what he didsay.I know it is somewhat like an opposite answer to what your asking but I felt like it fit anyway.

He reminds me of the east coast version of Patrick Kearney.Two gay friends of mine were living in and around Los Angeles as young adults when the Bonin Kraft and Kearney murders were happening and they remember being extremely scared and cautious and very picky who they would go places with and they did not get in strangers cars or have a lot of hook ups or one night stands with anyone and everyone who they met in bars or public places even though that was extremely common in the midlate s and very early s before HIVAIDS were known about.,serialkillers,dep1szg,2,t5_2s9td
