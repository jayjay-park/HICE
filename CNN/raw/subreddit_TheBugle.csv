7225240,0,t1_d1zf1mt,Im biased because Im not a fan of John but I think the last point is very debatable. I dont know what the numbers were but around episode  mark I think it was pretty popular and Im guessing it was largely a UK fanbase at that time a time at which John was still no more famous than Andy in the UK.,TheBugle,d1zgfca,2,t5_2s4h1

9747276,0,t1_daedo9a,Yep. If taking a few minutes to listen to a few ads is what I need to do to in order to enjoy the Bugle Im all for it. Plus  happy that the guys are getting some revenue for their efforts.,TheBugle,daekbi9,8,t5_2s4h1
10356187,0,t1_dchfney,Well thats shitty thing to do. Of they need to add ads for future episodes fine. But to add them to past episodes financed thanks to fans.Its a shame they are doing that. Maybe they didnt add any ads on the SoundCloud because thats what on thebuglepodcast.com ? They havent update the website either BTW.,TheBugle,dchxmzo,1,t5_2s4h1
