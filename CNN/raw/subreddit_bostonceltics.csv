Playing Sully with an obviously injured hand seemed unnecessarily  risky but if we look at it as Ainge showcasing Sully it makes a little sense. Unfortunately without giving up  or  more picks that kind of package wont garner much of a haul. Frankly I have little grasp on what the teams plans are going forward and Im not going to pull my hair out worrying Ill let that shnts guy write a k word post about the direction of the franchise instead. That said out of the trio of Sully Green and Bradley Avery is probably the hardest to move right now. His play suggests a M per year player while hes asking for M and that was before we knew he could shoot.

447258,0,t1_cfr42wg,Its a gray area and not clearly defined in the CBA. There are lots of things like this the most famous being the Stepien Rule that says you cant trade first round picks two years in a  row. Thats not in the CBA but the league enforces it using their veto power over trades. Every trade ends with both teams conference calling the league office to register their trade and have it approved. The league will not approve trades that are conditional on other moves because that would allow for CBA circumvention.In this case youre not allowed to combine exceptions. A team cant package a TPE with another player because that is a combination of exceptions a trade exception and a traded player exception so simply splitting it into two conditional trades would not be allowed by the league office. If they were making two trades that could each stand on their own or be combined together it wouldnt be an issue. If they made one trade and just kept it quiet and then made the other one later they would probably get it through but thats shaky ground and the TWolves would have no recourse if we backed out.,bostonceltics,cfr4g54,3,t5_2qmkf

There may be a contender willing to make an MLE offer but what team is going to spend above that in cap space to make a lucrative offer? That team would need to make that offer knowing that the cap space is then tied up for a few days while we decide if well match. If we do that team lost out on the chance to sign alternatives. This is why teams dont make offers to midrange RFAs. The SG market will play out and AB will either get an MLE offer resign on our terms or be left with little leverage in  a market where everyone who needs a SG has already gotten one. Thats how RFA plays out for players in Averys class most of the time.Beyond that the three players you compared him to all signed for teams that are or thought they wee contending. Rebuilding teams should never pay for role players. The cap in increasing faster than expected. Were going to have max cap space in two seasons. Even the slight chance that a star wants to sign in Boston is better than eating up the cap with someone who turns a  win team into a  win team. Its not worth it.All we should do is make a qualifying offer extend him a token contract offer like .M that hell reject but that we can just leave out there and wait for the market to play out.

1134888,0,t1_chx9dlq,The traded player exception part of the CBA applies to a bunch of stuff but generally when people talk about a TPE they are talking about the one year credit.Yes a cap hold is applied for all credits. Exceptions are exceptions to the cap so a team under the cap cant use or even have any. Thats why a cap hold is also applied for the MLE and a team that goes under the salary cap can only use the smaller room midlevel and even then only once theyve gone back above the cap.None of the TPEcredits can be used in any trade for Kevin Love unless the argument is to try some cap circumvention and use a TPE to eat a salary like Buddingers in a separate trade but the league would probably nix the whole thing if we did try to get that through. The numbers just dont add up.If we trade for Kevin Love it will most likely be. Choice of Sullinger or Olynyk. Choice of BassBogans AnthonyJohnsonBabbBogans or Jeff Green. Whatever picks are necessaryFrom there wed have to see if Minnesota is trying to dump an additional salary on us and adjust the details from there to create the closest possible salary match andor a trade exception from the Wolves.The Pierce TPE continues to be the best home for Omer Asik either in s straight swap or in a multiteam move to eat salary to facilitate a Houston move on someone like Melo or Monroe example Melo to Houston for Lin to NYK and Asik to us with picks moving around.Im not planning on updating this for next season but heres my cap tool where you can see how exceptions impact our cap position.,bostonceltics,chxa9iz,1,t5_2qmkf

2007736,0,t3_2hnute,The figures you are seeing are not their salaries but their Cap Holds. Heres a decent explanation of what they are Heres the long and extremely detailed answerIn short when a player becomes a free agent they are assigned a cap hold. This is an amount of money that counts against the salary cap calculation. The reason for them is that you can resign your own free agents without needing to be under the cap due to Bird rights. If you didnt have cap holds then you could have all of your FAs not count against the cap then sign a bunch of other teams FAs and then resign your own. Cap holds prevent this.Why do we still have cap holds for players like Shaq etc? Well weve not been under the salary cap since any of these guys played so weve not needed to renounce their cap holds. Its basically just no one has done the paperwork. When we finally dip below the cap they will be quickly renounced.,bostonceltics,ckv4ohn,9,t5_2qmkf

2397594,0,t1_cm80yn2,Theres no doubt Sullinger has been our best player. Rajon is the most talented and  in a single game against a good opponent hes our best chance to win but Sully has clearly outperformed him to this point. All of the team stats with Sullinger onoff the court are ridiculous. Were as good as TorontoChicago when hes on the court and as bad as the Knicks when hes off it.On Olynyk I dont think counting foul assists would change anything but I do wish someone had been counting them for the past  years. Sullinger draws fouls for teammates with his draw help on the upfake shovel pass move. Kelly is still a very good passer but Brad has intelligently changed the scheme. Olynyk should take more threes and that means bringing Sullinger inside the arc as the passer in set plays. Hes probably picked up  assists just on the play where Rondo feeds him at the top of the key and he makes the quick onehanded pass to the cutter out of the right corner. Kelly could make that pass but it works better if hes the screener because his shot has to be respected AND its usually his man we want to move out of position.gtWhen youve got a point guard who chases League assist leader two quality passing bigs a forward who runs the point and good passing system well fam you end up league leader in Assists and Assist Ratio. Even if you throw in our cataclysmic amount of turnovers were still top ten in ASTTO ratio.We start a SG and SF who are TERRIBLE passers for their position!

Not that thats always a bad thing as passing up a good shot for a great shot is what you want out of a team but I feel like he defers to passing it away a bit much. But hopefully hell start taking more shots when he gets better at figuring out if he truly is passing up a good shot for a great shot and adds a few more moves to his arsenal. Just because of his lack of defense if we can draft a good defensive center Im fairly interested in Myles Turner if we drop low enough to draft him Id be interested to see Kelly eventually coming off the bench and splitting time at PF and C.

2596116,0,t3_2ph19m,Around here uchrisforsberg is definitely number one based on number of links posted to their stuff. Thats been the case for a while and may have been helped by his AMA. Reddit loves an insider as Ty Lawson has shown. Scott Souza and Gary Washburn tweets show up sometimes especially for news on roster or injury stuff. The same for Steve Bulpett and Jay King. I dont think people on here particularly care who broke the daily news on things. No matter who you follow you get that news within a few minutes. Big news is all broken by the national guys. Forsberg produces a lot of content for ESPN so more of his nontwitter stuff naturally gets posted than for anyone else.Reddit skews young so among the broader audience media its . Bill Simmons . Jackie MacMullan . Bob Ryan . Shaughnessy just like he likes it.If a team can have a media story of the year its the rise of CelticsBlog. With all their new writers I think theyve moved way ahead of all the other indysemiindy blogs. My guess is that they account for  of link volume for blogs that arent direct extensions of ESPNGlobeHerald. Their content is much more reliable and well researched than everyone elses. If theres anyone in the world who really cares about the meta media news of a single team it will be interesting to see if being that much bigger than the rest is a good thing.Weve spent years trying to promote self posts with original content on here so none of the reporters or blogs make up a particularly large portion of the content that gets put up.

2730430,0,t1_cneedt8,He might be but  year old players are expected to have shown their ceiling by that age. Jeff Green is  by his age season he had already showed he can be a  player against the best competition in the world all of whom had NBA bodies many who had more experience and many who had more talent. Imagine instead if  year old Jeff Green played against players who were to a man almost all at least  years younger than him with less experience and talent than the most below average of professionals and youll get to why there are concerns about his age.This guy might very well be the diamond in the rough who fell through the cracks but age is a much bigger factor. Would you rather bet millions and a draft pick on a guy who put those numbers up against similar competition or the guy who did it as literally a man grown playing against teenagers.

2735025,0,t1_cnev1p9,correct me if Im wrong but havent the kings been trying to build around cousins? I know were probably more capable of doing the job but giving up all those draft picks to risk trying to pull in two more stars during free agency? Trying to do what the kinda have been trying to do? It just seems like a huge risk. I figured we got the picks because star players are necessity now a days while also hard to accumulate through trades because they play for successful teams that arent interested in picks or are in free agency and not interested when you have no pull. I figured we draft the guys like the Thunder Wizards Raptors Blazers Warriors all have and like the magic are doing currently. I dont think hes gonna give us the pull were looking for but he definately is a player Id grab if given the chance. I think its a good idea to go after him just not at the expense of our own draft pick.,bostonceltics,cneykzx,3,t5_2qmkf

They can always become faster stronger etc. but they will always be limited by their natural cap. Meanwhile stuff like shooting is simply muscle memory. You do it enough times and you will get better at it guaranteed though you do need correct form of course. Plus I would say good defense is more valuable than good offense in the NBA where scorers are a dime a dozen because it seems like most players grow up wanting to be the number  option.

2780983,0,t3_2rxdw7,While Turner had a Rondoesque statline it would have been nice to see Smart start driving in on pick amp rolls other than just giving it to Bass or Olynyk. He started  from three and chucked up  bad ones after. If he exhibited some aggression maybe Stevens can give Young some of Turners minutes as he had a very poor shooting night as did Thornton our other  point shooter. Granted that is asking a lot from our rookie point guard. On the other end we could not stop Hibbert luckily he faded away as he usually does in crunch time. Our defense could use a lot of work but we stepped it up in the second half. We severely lack a big time rebounder or a lock down post player. Overall I was pleased with Crowder and Bass with Smart showing some glimmers of being able to run an offense. ,bostonceltics,cnk6si5,1,t5_2qmkf

2818584,0,t3_2scwkt,I enjoyed reading what youve written.  You provide a very thorough analysis of multiple parts of Turner from his basic stats to his contract. One thing that has always bothered me is the way Turner handles the ball which could contribute to his proneness to turning the ball over.  It never looks like he has complete control of the ball at all times but other times makes some nifty passes to a cutting man like he did with Sullinger last night. ,bostonceltics,cnogsii,2,t5_2qmkf
2829548,0,t1_cnplesj,gtTanking is stripping all the talent out of your organization and putting replacement level players on the court every night. yeah thats what theyve done.  say all you want about talent or potential but there isnt a player on the team currently whos worthy of starting on a contender outside of maybe bass.  gtTanking is shutting down your veteran players for prolonged periods with vague injuries.this is pretty specific.  it seems plain the goal is to have a worse record and by correlation a worse draft pick this year.  those trades could have been made later inafter the season and are not much different from shutting down your vets so you win fewer games. ,bostonceltics,cnppqgv,-1,t5_2qmkf

2845946,0,t3_2socmj,This is awesome! Tremendous work and a really cool diagram. Its a really strong testament to what Dannys doing. My favorite move of his in the past few years and part of its on the chart is that at the  Trade Deadline Danny turned Leandro Barbosa Torn ACL at the time and Jason Collins averaging under  MPG  multiple DNPs in his last  games with the Celtics into Jordan Crawford Eastern Conference Player of the Week that one time!!.He then flipped Crawford for that Philly protected first which will likely become  high second rounders...So to backtrack with the transitive property An injured Barbosa  Jason Collins gt  likely very high second round picks.Not the flashiest of Dannys moves but to me it really illustrates what I think his philosophy is at this point which is to benefit in a tangible way from each and every trade even if its just a little bit. One last analogy while Im feeling it... For those of you whove seen Any Given Sunday if you havent seen it at least take a look at this clip NSFW language  Danny like Al Pacinos Tony DAmato realizes where the Celtics are at but also knows that if he can gain even just a little bit with each move he makes hes accumulating inches and getting incrementally better. At some point the Celtics are going to add up and cash in on all those inches in the form of a big deal. I have no idea whowhatwhen the move will be but at some point were going to add up all those inches weve gained in the last few years to cash in and with Dannys track record Im willing to bet itll be something special. ,bostonceltics,cnrl0gg,6,t5_2qmkf
2879246,0,t1_cnvc2ni,I think part of the reason for ABs decline on defense has to do with the change in coaching.  Stevens focuses a lot more on team defense and ices the pick a majority of the time.  Its kind of forced Bradley to play more conservative.  He was heralded for his defense mostly because of his incredibly high motor.  He would pick up players full court and basically hawk them for a steal the entire time they had the ball.  Hes still a good defender and is incredibly quick with his feet but hes just doing things differently in Stevens system.  It could also have to do with the fact that hes been trying to focus on his offensive game a lot more the past  years.Marcus Smart is the same height but is a lot stronger which helps him guard bigger players and has a longer wingspan which makes it easier to block shots and get steals.  He also has great balance and incredibly good instincts.  Hes well disciplined on pump fakes and knows when its the right time to reach in for a steal.  His instincts length and strength give him the advantage over AB despite AB being slightly quicker.,bostonceltics,cnvder6,11,t5_2qmkf

I wouldnt be surprised to see Ainge try and go after him.  He has a lot of similarities to Olynyk except slightly better defensive potential because of his length and fundamentals.  Id probably prefer someone with more rim protecting potential someone like TownsTurnerPorzingis but obviously those guys might be harder to get now that were not in the lottery.  I think youre giving up WAY too much tho.  Were projected to get the  pick in the draft and Kaminski is being projected between  so I dont think it would make sense to trade Sully whose only a year older than Kaminski and still has plenty of upside and a very valuable Brooklyn pick that has a lot of potential to be a high lottery pick.  Remember when we traded up for Olynyk which was kind of the same spot we were able to do it by swapping picks and giving up  second rounders. ,bostonceltics,cpqfobp,8,t5_2qmkf

3755453,0,t3_33fbo6,Couple of thoughtsWe defended the three a little better this game but they also missed a ton of open looks. There were a few possesions where we closed on the wrong guys mozgov played too tight on Shump when there are more dangerous threats and had some awful communications on rotations Bradley and Smart closing on same guys. However we also defended the PnR a shitload better leading to fewer open looks. Very few open rim rolls as our hedges and recoveries were much smoother. Defensive end held water...until Lebron realized we have one player on our team who can even slightly bother him and proceeded to eat our lunch.On offense I honestly thought we were stellar besides the first ish minutes of the rd No IT. We seemed to get good looks whenever we wanted they just werent fallingMozgov Mozgoved us. ShumpDellyMoz actually contained IT really well kept him out of the paint and forced him into some tough looksTOs. Besides that we kept it moving and got pretty much wherever we wanted. If we move the ball like that in Game  and hit open looks we can take it.ET played very well despite the efficency. Moved the rock penerated and defended the position.Covered IT earlier he still takes some boneheaded shots and makes some bad passes I even thought he couldve been more aggressive at some points instead of pulling up. He needs to be a better passer in the PnRour bigs have to be better options.AB was stellar on D until the refs hamstrung him. Ive sincerely never seen someone bother Kyrie that much. His offense has been shite but he needs to be on the floor.I dont really see where Smart belongs in this series. He can obviously defend JR but he cant check Lebron or Kyrie and doesnt bring enough off the dribble to take advantage on O. He had some nice drives today but if he cant hit shots were better off with an IT Bradley backcourt in crunch time.Bass  needs to show up on offense to win.Zeller has been our best two way player so far along with Crowder.Sully and Olynyk showed life if they can keep giving us a good ish minutes each thats hugeI think we can honestly take the next  games,bostonceltics,cqkcksm,3,t5_2qmkf

Remember game in the playoffs vs the Heat a few years ago. Or that whole series against the Bulls I believe during Roses rookie season.The guy had so much potential. But he is a diva. The problem is he is not good enough to get away with it anymore. I dont care what system you are in. If you are elite you find a way to at least perform. Rondo isnt doing that.

There are plenty of reasons that he didnt take Minny to the postseason hes had injury concerns hes played in an extremely competitive West and hes by far not the only star on a bad team that failed to make the playoffs. Kyrie failed to do so in the East for example but hes looking pretty good now. Love would need to be paired with another star talent as Kyrie was with LeBron in order to win it all some day. But getting him is a great great start. Its worth noting by the way that the Cs are already a playoff team without Love.Finally building on another point of yours I feel compelled to emphasize that I think WCS would be an ideal compliment for Love in the front court.

Theyre better off trading an expiring Lee and the newly drafted Looney or a future first to get where they want to be. I get the hesitation with another lowish value first round pick. However GS was the healthiest by far team this past season in a longish time. Im not saying that I necessarily predict that they have some huge fall from grace but should they suffer injury woes this season its not infeasible that they fall off a little. Falling to the  to  pick in the West would help the pick a little.The Warriors also traded future firsts to Utah in order to salary dump Biedrins and Jefferson to sign Iggy. Its quite likely that should they trade us a pick it wouldnt be til  or  around where the Memphis pick we own is. A lot can change in that time and its unclear where that pick could be.To me thatd be a better asset than a guy in Terrence Jones. I like Jones but hes just another young swing to quote Stevens position literature. The idea of having him Sully and Kelly together can be tempting but it does introduce the risk that in trying to divvy up minutes to all three of them to develop them that none may develop. Thats all Im trying to say here.

4611936,0,t1_ctbti28,I went and checked and here are the resultsI took the first five professional seasons for every top draft pick since the lottery began . I then counted for each pick slot how many players made an all star team in those first five years and then put a logarithmic trend line through that sample to determine the odds that a player selected at each pick slot would make an All Star team during the five years that a team has guaranteed contract control its fewer for nd round picks but it makes more sense to stay consistent on this. The problem is that All Star appearances dont produce a very good trend line probably because of how the All Star team is determined. Ill show the odds below but they skew low on top picks because of a poor line fit.As an alternative I also ran the count of players who have at least one  win share season in their first five years. Eight win shares is about the top  players each season so its good shorthand for who should have been a full season All Star. If a player has an eight win share season in their first five years you would probably consider them a building block player there have been  such players in all the drafts from .Pick Slot|Odds of being an All Star in lt Years|Odds of gt  WS Season in lt Years||||||.|.|.|.|.|.||.|.|.|.||.|.|.|.||.|.|.|.|.||.|.|||.|.|.|.|.|.|lt.|lt.|lt.|lt.|lt.|lt.Your odds of getting at least one literal All Star picking at    and  is higher than picking at  where Winslow went and about the same as at  where we were trying to move to.Your odds of getting at least one statistical All Star picking at    and  is higher than picking at  where Winslow went and about the same as at . between Mudiay and Johnson.There are lots of other factors at play here. You might say that this draft was deeper than normal and then has a steeper dropoff but thats just conjecture. I suspect you could find experts to give you just about every possible predraft assessment on most draft classes. You can say that Winslow is better than his draft slot but again opinions differ and he went where he went.The other thing is that when you have four picks theres some slim possibility that you actually get multiple All Star performers out of it. If you try to value every pick on expected production which assumes you have the playing time to give all four players a shot which isnt really the case you can use the method I did and find that the four picks are worth  more than  or Kevin Peltons method that says theyre worth almost  more.Whether youre star hunting or collecting value  is better than  or . If you add in the Mavs pick next season which probably projects to the  range right now plus what will likely be around the th pick in  and the th pick in  and you get a massive imbalance by all measures. You basically have to think that Winslow was really a top five pick to justify giving  for him and at least a top three pick to add in the Mavs and TWolves picks. All Star Trend Line .

His defensive ability will keep him on the floor and theres nothing more important than real playing time for a guys development.

5409295,0,t3_3p4nrt,Does anyone else see the sneaky brilliance of what Danny is doing? Sullys minutes look like theyre going to suffer mightily but Zeller wont play as much as he did last year either. When restricted free agency rolls around neither Zeller nor Sullinger will be armed with the numbers they would have put up had Danny not signed Amir and traded for Lee. Whether Danny resigns them or matches an offer sheet it will undoubtedly be cheaper because their numbers will suffer due simply to a minutes crunch. Sure with the cap bonanza to come someone might throw money at Zeller for the hell of it or to force Dannys hand but I dont see that happening with Sully.Basically my point is this now is not the time to trade Sully. Danny can resign him next year on the cheap when his numbers take a hit and when Lee and Amir move on in a year or two his numbers will rise again  hell be on a great contract hypothetically of course and his trade value will be ten times what it is now especially if he handles the minutes crunch like a pro. Obviously none of that is a guarantee  but its a smarter strategy than dumping him now for next to nothing. If it doesnt work out and he gains a bunch of weight or starts pouting Danny and Brad will give him the Bogans treatment and the Celtics move on no harm done.,bostonceltics,cw33iwn,4,t5_2qmkf

5643116,0,t3_3sefy9,So I was thinking of doing a post on this but heres as good a place as any to works this out. I pulled the two defensive possessions from last nights game that I think best encapsulate how Kelly Olynyk plays effective defense. RES recommended.They can be found here and hereIn the first clip we can see the type of blown coverage that can stem from playing as hyperactive and swarming defense as the Celtics do. It starts here with Jerebko also closing out on a kickout for the Greek Freak even though hes Crowders man and hes even with him. This is a pretty acceptable reason to blow a coverage but my point is its not pristine defense. This means Johnny OBryant gets cut loose to go stand under the basket.This leaves Jerebko scrambling back to his man while Olynyk has to cover two men under the basket. This series may not look sexy or catch any top  plays but what Olynyk does next is very important. Watch him shove Greg Monroe further out than he wants to be to work out of the post but then hes also ready to rotate to JOB the second the entry pass is bulleted in there. Recovering from blown coverages are about delaying the bucket as long as possible and forcing more passes so while this isnt sexy what happens next is tremendously important.When the entry pass gets there Olynyk is already turned and showing making JOB realized hes going to need to get more vertical in order to shoot over Olynyk whos going to be between him and the rim. This changes his shot enough for Jerebko to come and loudly block the dunk.Again a sexy play for someone else when actually Jerebko might have been the scapegoat for a blown defensive possession had KO not covered for him.In the second clip a breakdown again is going to come from Jerebko playing hyperaggressive defense. Also again its not a breakdown I have a tremendous problem with. When you mix trapping and doubling what happens in this clip into your defense youre going to get burned by guys splitting you and passing out of it every once in a while. Our offense has struggled at times so I think the chance of steals it presents to ignite fast break opportunities is worth it.Anyway here Jerebko doubles onto Middleton to help Hunter leaving JOB with a lane to the rim Kelly notices the rolling JOB and positions himself accordingly so that when Middleton manages to pass out of the double Olynyk has already established challenging position in front of the hoopIts important to note that Olynyk cant take a charge because hes in the restricted area. Rotating from the weakside big assignment in Henson took time and now he cant get between JOBs roll and clear the restricted area in time. This means hell just have to use verticality and challenge as best he can.And holy shit does he swallow up JOB OBryant realizes hes not going to get the shot off in time so you can see him looking to make the right play and find the open Henson. In the clip you can already see Crowder coming to rotate and hell eventually fluster Henson enough zooming in that hell leave ball unguarded long enough for Turner to poke the ball away.Again the perimeter guys get the cooler plays but the table is set with Olynyk just positionally being in the right place at the right time and understanding what he needs to do.,bostonceltics,cwwkzzs,37,t5_2qmkf

5837982,0,t3_3v6ren,Smart seriously does so many good things. Maybe hell never be a star but he is almost certain to be an elite glueguy on a championship contender. Evan Turner Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley are three very different types of guards. But Smart can fill whatever gap needs to be filled be it spotting up in the corner running the offense playing D on or off ball...he just does what needs to be done.    Hes also more of a leader than I think any of us are aware of. Certainly he talks a lot on defense and his tenacity sets the tone all over the floor. But I think he really is an off the court leader for this team. He can still be that when injured but a lot of leading is leading by example. Obviously he cant lead by example in a boot.     The numbers may not always show it but Marcus makes this team work. Sometimes things are clunky without him.,bostonceltics,cxkvx91,10,t5_2qmkf

6317742,0,t3_424m05,The ideas I have been playing around with lately have been the Celtics facilitating a  way trade. Something likeCeltics get Love.Cavs get Melo.Knicks get Lee Sully I figure Love is just a better version of what Sully could ever be and up to something like  first round nonNets draft picks and a handful of second round picks over the next several years. My theory being that Melo would be a slightly better fit in Cleveland than Love and the Knicks basically have no one on their team that would be on their future Kristaps centric contender they can use some of the picks to get role players and some of the picks to sweeten a future trade deal. I think a team like Houston could replace the Knicks in this way as well.If it were just a straight up trade for Love then I would make Smart Crowder and Thomas untouchable. I believe if Love were to play for the Celtics he could get back to being the force he was in Minnesota but if we cant maintain our defensive identity I am not sure I see the point of adding Love. If Sully with all of his physical limitations can be th of a good defensive unit then I think Love could learn to do the same though I realize I might unfairly be selling Sully short on his defensive ability and IQ The point here is playing Love with Smart and Crowder should still be a good defensive unit. So besides simply draft picks the players of significant value I would make available would be Bradley Sully Olynyk and Johnson. Sully I think would be super redundant with Love though the Cavs probably value him the least. Johnson is super valuable to us right now but he is not going to last much longer beyond his contract. If the Cavs were to take Olynyk or Bradley they can have  maybe  first round picks. The key here though should be that the Celtics are not desperate the Cavs are. There is no reason if a trade were to happen that they get  cents on the dollar but if that is what the Cavs are demanding then we wait.,bostonceltics,cz7r944,1,t5_2qmkf

I was trying to say the Celts have consistently competed with the best and rarely been blown out but so far have lost most of the close last minute winnable games to experienced teams like Warriors Spurs and Cavs. Part of it is needing more consistent closers other than IT part of it seems to just be bad luck so far with the other team going off at the end.Theyd be nd at  if they went  versus . teams. From a team that hustled their way to the playoffs in a weak ECF last year to currently th place and one game back from rd Ive been more than happy with their progress.

He took a leap this year but I dont see Crowder getting any better than he is now. Thats fine because hes very good. He was in AllStart talk. I think people especially us here in the sub overrate his defense but the real reason Crowder is so valuble isnt the raw stats or even the teeny tiny long contract. ITs that he plays on the wing and there simply arent a lot of good wing players in the NBA. Every good wing player ends up being an AllStar because when you are a good wing player you are that much better than every other player.My issue with trading Crowder for someone like Blake is that its going to be difficult to replace that wing depth.

Hes even got a bit of a go to move going where he gives to hard quick dribbles with the right hand and crosses it back over left creating space for him to drive lefty usually just one lefty dribble leading to a pull up though. ,bostonceltics,czsoyvc,2,t5_2qmkf

6556475,0,t1_czxhkui,Word thats a good point. On the bright side for the Celtics a competitive rebuild involves pretty much the same process for them that failed last time i.e. overpay free agents. They dont really have any other options. Worse for them and better for Cs they have less allure than last time. They are still in Brooklyn which is an advantage but the franchises reputation has taken such a dive and I cant imagine too many free agents are really going to want to end up there especially in a year where lots of teams have big cap space.,bostonceltics,czxhrpu,3,t5_2qmkf

6574055,0,t1_czzam1l,Its a separate issue youre discussing is all. With that said Id be wary of Bartons improvement from the outside. He could regress to his mean and become below average. I also dont think he brings everything else Turner does. Barton has had some games with higher assist numbers and I know he was a fantastic rebounder for a guard in college so I know its in there somewhere. But if were talking about the spot behind Crowder theres no reason for Barton to take Turners minutes since Turner is more suited to guard s. Im admittedly high on Turner and think he does more for this team than most fans do and Im firmly in the camp of folks who dont think we need another  guard. ,bostonceltics,czzb8ig,1,t5_2qmkf

6594443,0,t1_d01elh4,They would be in a much better position in  if they start getting assets now. Even if they get some nice young role players out of the those midround picks that will fit there timeline much better than Brook and Thad in . Also it gives you the chance of finding a real keeper in the mid to late part of the first. I also take issue with your position that they will find guys in free agency that will make them playoff contenders. Who? The East is deep and good now. Every team in the East outside of Philly has better and younger players than Brooklyn. Not only that almost every single team has cap space and a bunch have max space! Who the fuck is gonna sign with Brooklyn if you could literally pick ANYWHERE ELSE? They might be able to lure some below average veterans with huge overpayments but that leaves them at ground zero of the rebuild in . Greg Monroe and LeMarcus Aldridge were evidence that players want good situations and localities dont matter to these guys as much. I dont understand at all why that is the better path. Its shortsighted and certainly doesnt guarantee a first round playoff exit which is a pretty useless goal anyway. ,bostonceltics,d01f443,0,t5_2qmkf

6641634,0,t3_46m1a9,I stream most Celtics games and you can find them in game threads here. Watch those. As far as players heres a little breakdown of a few of my favorites.  Isaiah Thomas Dubbed THE LITTLE GUY by Tommy hes our  foot  All Star point guard. Hes the best scorer on the team and he does it in volume. Hes super quick great finishing at the rim and a great free throw shooter. Awesome to watch.  Evan Turner My personal favorite on the team. Hes our second unit guy. Hes a  foot  point forward. Hes real fancy with the dribble and pass and a true wildcard. Hes got a funny voice and has awesomely hilarious quotes all the time. His midrange game is money and he takes it to the rim pretty frequently. Youll almost never see him take an outside shot because hes terrible at them so he has that real oldschool vibe. Watch out for this guy in crunch time. He likes to take over and he does so pretty frequently this year.  Marcus Smart Our defensive specialist. Hes our th overall pick from two years ago. He can lock down most perimeter guys including small forwards. Hes pretty raw offensively but hes quickly blossoming into someone we can rely on for  or so points a game.  Avery Bradley Our andD guard. Hes small maybe  feet but he LOCKS DOWN guards. Hes probably one of the best Curry stoppers in the league. Insane lateral and general quickness. Great hands and vision for passing lanes. Hes started shooting the  ball pretty consistently. Hes also been pretty clutch. Hit a game winning buzzer beating  pointer to beat the Cavs a few weeks ago.  Kelly Olynyk Another favorite of mine. Hes a goober for sure but a  footer who can shoot is awesome. He was a guard in high school and it really shows in the NBA. Hes got good passing good handles decent footwork and great shooting. Hes shooting well over  from deep this season. Having him on the court is instant offense just because he brings a lot of spacing and due to that it allows Evan Turner to get to the rim easier. As far as rivals we dont really have any right now. You could say the Cavs because of LeBron but theyre better than we are so its not really a true one. ,bostonceltics,d06awfi,9,t5_2qmkf

6826502,0,t3_4976o5,Wrote a post on rbostonceltics advocating the unloading of a number of players and picks for Melo at the start of the  season. After seeing the Cs play Melo and the Knicks in person and watching the majority of the Celtics season I have done a full  and would strongly oppose adding Melo on the basis of chemistry and timeline fit. The new era Celtics are a team full of players who have been looked down on and unfairly maligned their whole careers. Melo would add tremendous skill and scoring ability to the Cs. He also undeniably would bring the weight of championship expectations and the baggage of multiple failed endeavors along with him. I mean just look at the clothing line the man just put out.  I appreciate Melos game as much as the next guy but sadly he just doesnt fit the young teams identity nor their nobody believes in us attitude and likely winds up taking more off the table than he brings to it. Trade Zeller Jerebko Young along with DAL  and BKN  pick rights with cash for Cousins after the Kings miss the playoffs for the tenth straight year and the Boogie Sacramento relationship becomes completely and hopelessly untenable.,bostonceltics,d0q30m8,5,t5_2qmkf

Right now he plays defense across  positions is our nd best playmaker and one of our clutch players. Personally I think you can never have enough of these guys. I could absolutely see him as our shawn livingston  a valuable bench presence whos versatile and reliable. However theres a price to that role as well. With the increasing cap if guys like batum are gonna make  mil Im afraid Evan Turner is going to get at least  mil and Im not sure his production which will not be fully replaced by our younger players unless we get simmons lol is worth that kind of investment. I think this subreddit has kinda convinced me that even though we have a ton of cap space theres no reason to go ahead and overpay guys just to get incrementally better. I would rather wait have KD leave OKC and then we go after Serge Ibaka in . We have shown we can survive without a rim protector for now.

He proceeded to throw his body around with reckless abandon in fiveonfive action. Maccabis staff urged him to take it easy but Bender simply doesnt know how to do that at this point in his career.His work ethic sounds exciting. His jumper used to suck but then he spent a summer on it and it came back looking silky.

Bender is way ahead in terms of how polished he is creativity versatility and his body.

In aggregate age is a huge factor in predicting NBA success.Dont believe me? Well heres Scientific American on the topicgtIn fact the only variables that predicted NBA success were youth college performance and college quality. These variables predicted NBA performance better than draft order. Whats more while younger players were more productive in the NBA than older players consistent with this study younger players were not on average better in college than older players.So what does that mean? It means that Buddy Hield certainly might succeed. His college performance is predictive and the fact that he goes to a relatively major college program means that he has been on the basketball radar for a long time which is good but hes missing the  predictive factor for NBA success being identified as a pro prospect at a young age.The age at which a player is identified as an NBAlevel talent is actually more predictive than the players performance in college. This is why Jamal Murray who was both productive in college and an NBA prospect at  years old should be ranked above someone like Hield. Jaylen Browns profile kicks up a ton of bust flags so Im not sure where hell place but when DX does their statistical projections I would bet that young players like Ellenson Chriss Davis and Rabb will place higher than Hield in some boards purely based on the fact that theyve been identified as lottery talents at  years old instead of .Theres obviously a spot at which Hield becomes a smart pick. Should he be going in the top or maybe even the top? Probably not.,bostonceltics,d1s0vhn,32,t5_2qmkf

Doesnt always mean that there was a lack of confidence or even that anything could have been done differently. Obviously I dont think coaches do nothing during games but theres only so much of an effect they can have. I feel pretty confident that they dont have the ability to make a  point difference on the outcome of a game assuming theyre actively trying to win. Id also say momentum and confidence are pretty low on the list of ways they can effect the game compared to play calls late game clock management overall game planstrategy and lineups. ,bostonceltics,d2iz0i3,2,t5_2qmkf

How many teams of quality would you have to go through in the west to get to the finals vs the east? Thats how OKCs road is harder. We can say they most likely have to go through cavs and GS to win a championship. I dont see a team comparable to the Spurs or clippers in the east they could also face. Besides the cavs everyone in the east is a pretender. So going through the west could lead you through  great teams. Going through the east will be . I think your way overrating OKC as well. I know regular season is hard to judge when there was only two games. OKC with durant won without him the lost. To try and say without durant OKC still kills us I find to be not true. With the Celtics game being Defense first adding KD to that for the load of offense I think would make the D even better. Sign a FA center trade picks for another star.

Where Marcus is now he was better than Bradley at that point. You are acting as if Avery was always this great scorer and you could rely on him whenever for points. His whole problem was that he couldnt score and people were outraged by his contract extension because of this exact flaw.  years in Marcus is far beyond Avery offensively.

7875466,0,t3_4n6omv,I dont have a throbbing hard on for Cousins. Are you a Kings fan? I ask this because there are clearly trades that benefit you because Demarcus Cousins is not going to stay with Sacremento you are not a title contender you are not even a playoff team. We have the rd pick in this draft   nds the  BKN pick rights for what should be a top  realistic potential to be top  pick in a stacked draft the  BKN st rounder  Memphis st rounder. In addition to  year old all defensive NBA team aboveaverage three point shooter Avery Bradley on a good contract  year old Smart on a great contract IT on a great contract value wise Jae Crowder on a great contract. There are plenty of hypothetical trade scenarios in which the Kings can benefit. If Boston offered the rd overall th overall and either the  or  BKN st for Cousins straight up the Kings would benefit from that in my opinion. Not that they would do that trade thats not what I am saying but Cousins isnt going to stay there and they arent going to compete for a title or even a playoff run in the West thats a fact. So why not maximize the assets you have now? The Kings are an inept organization though so they probably wont trade Cousins and he will just end up walking in FA for nothing. ,bostonceltics,d419wpo,5,t5_2qmkf

7884877,0,t3_4n6s4v,Since this is the Celtics sub Ill assume you are only interested in the better NBA Coach.I think for this past season Brad has to have a big lead in this fuzzy metric.  This was Donovans first season in the NBA and while I think he performed admirably I think he still has a ways to go to really get the hang of the professional game.  Brad has had  seasons now in the league and seems to have been better in each successive season.  Donovan had superstar talent on OKC and they were certainly a juggernaut at times this season.  But OKCs problem for the last several seasons has been one of coaching and thats why I wasnt crazy about them bringing in a college coach with no prolevel coaching experience as their ultimate push to prove to Durant that OKC was his best place longterm.I think it might be too early to say who has more potential as a longterm NBA head coach.  Like I mentioned above it has only been a single season with Donovan in this role.  I think he did a good job of working with that roster.  But until the challenge presents itself I have no idea of what to expect from Donovan as a coach with a dearth of professional talent on his team.  Brad has excelled in this role thus far but we dont know how he would manage a team laden with OKCs talent.  Hopefully well all get to see both scenarios eventually throughout their coaching careers. ,bostonceltics,d42bzyx,1,t5_2qmkf

So the players most recent season is weighted two times the season before that if available three times and two seasons before that five times.

8105375,0,t3_4q85aa,If Coach Stevens continues his policy of earning your minutes and playing to win additional veteran players will detract from developing young players. Clearly Brad has good reasons for his methods given his success with them and asking him to go away from what works may be met with some justifiable resistance. The older players themselves would surely not be pleased with a rookiesfirst policy. Deviating from earning your minutes could have a negative impact on motivation and the locker room gestalt we treasure. Who would want to train their replacement when the trainer is staying in the league? Who wants to watch someone else play the minutes you earned?If PBS remains inflexible in his policy then the only way Danny has to get court minutes for the young players is to clear away crutch players like ET and avoid hiring more such as Jared Dudley. That will have a negative impact on the record and cause endless bellyaching from pundits and fans but it might be the best approach protecting Brad from being put in an difficult position with his players and deflecting the heat to Danny.TLDR The teams development andor culture could be harmed by adding free agents.

I only mentioned him for  reasons I believe he denied the Warriors  year deal for M Im  sure He is affordable as we could easily get rid of Amir Jonas and Sully sign Barnes and make Jaylen his backup  The Warriors want to clear space for Durant should he choose to go there.

8121247,0,t3_4qdxri,From the insider section about potentially overpaid free agents this summer. Mr. HowardDwight HowardHoward recently opted out of his  million player option for the  season. Apparently he believes he can land another longterm max offer.The problem is that Howard has declined significantly from his Orlando days when he truly was among the NBA elite. Between  and  Howard was consistently a topthree player in real plusminus impact. Last season he didnt even crack the top  with an RPM value right at the league average of ..Howards apex game was based on a freakish athleticism he no longer possesses. And although hes only  years old Howard has already logged nearly  minutes in his  NBA seasons and postseasons which is a lot of career mileage for a footer. Even worse He has never looked the same since his herniated disc surgery four years ago.In fact Ds scoring has steadily declined throughout the past five seasons culminating in a pedestrian average of just . points per game last season. He actually set a career best in point field goal percentage last season but hes also getting fewer attempts than ever. He also set a career low . percent from the free throw line keeping him firmly entrenched among the leagues worst in that departmentAnd despite having blocked an impressive . shots per  minutes back in his prime Dwights block rate is now down to a hohum .. He just led the league in goaltending calls despite his more earthbound game.Judging from his most recent years of play  and considering the typical aging curve of players on the wrong side of   Howard will likely continue his slow decline on his next contract. Perhaps for some team with a great passfirst point guard who could provide Howard with lots of easy looks inside it might make sense to sign him to a shortterm deal at a price considerably south of the max. Otherwise it looks inevitable that D is about to be vastly overpaid especially near the end of any longterm deal.,bostonceltics,d4swg1k,1,t5_2qmkf

Youre insane my friend.Then I said Basically saying if being NbaReady was considered in who to cut between Young and Hunter. That whatever level they evaluated Hunter to be wasnt enough to outweigh whatever level Young is considered to be.Implying that if the whole being Nbaready was being considered that it would be part of whatever is used to evaluate the two. Then you had trouble understanding me due to my confusing wording and said I was speaking gibberish.Also your comment was No reason could cause Young to become a good NBA starter are you saying theres no chance of him being a good one?

9707162,0,t1_da9lqpj,I agree that completely writing off any  year old he turns  in two weeks is a silly proposition.However like we saw with Big Al the past two seasons and Greg Monroe guys who are offensively minded lowpost players that cant defend are no longer startercaliber players in the NBA. And Monroe and Big Al are both excellent rebounders  which again is my primary problem with Okafor. The inside scoring is gorgeous and I love it but his inability to rebound on a team without a lot of good rebounders is fucking astounding. Jonas Jerebko has a higher career REB than Okafor. Jonas Jerebko!I think there is a flipside to the hes in the worst possible situation card sometimes those guys go to those places and learn bad habits that plague them throughout their career. Okafor has loafed through his first . seasons in the NBA and hes showing even less effort this year than he did last year. Im a fully believer in the effort is a skill line of thinking and I wonder if his time in Philly has effectively ruined him for every other team. Its easy to say hed be better with better teammates but are the bad habits he learned in Philly going to be able to be broken? Brad isnt going to play him if he doesnt hustle and doesnt rebound is it worth paying assets for a player that may not make it off the end of the bench?,bostonceltics,da9m6jl,2,t5_2qmkf

WashingtonMiami have more talent than the nets but more incentive to tank I think Phoenix will probably be worse but hard to say. Orlandos kind of a mess but I wouldnt say theyre worse than the nets. The Wolves should improve the Pelicans look better with Jrue back. The kings could implode especially if Boogie actually gets traded but for no theyre probably better than Brooklyn. The Lakers have already banked  wins. I guess my rambling argument is that the nets could easily be one of the three worst teams in the league but it is probably to early to say for sure. ,bostonceltics,dafbjj7,2,t5_2qmkf

Hes played the position for a long time in the league and is more than successful at it. Hes REALLY friggin good at it. Matt Moore as pointed this out a number of times to the people that constantly say Al Horford is not a natural center yet still he plays Center.Well done btw do you think trading for a Center is what is needed?

An while we do talk about a Gordon Hayward and Demarcus Cousins on here a whole lot theyre still the two who in my opinion who could be available Cousins more so than Hayward. Jazz I like this year many compared them to us and say that they are the Celtics of the west or we are the jazz of the east. While it would appear Hayward would leave a nice chunk of change on the table were he to leave Utah I still would love to see what someone like him and or Cousins could do in Boston. People keep fleeing to the west because they dont want to deal with Lebron so maybe someone next year decides Im going to take it right to him.

10225202,0,t1_dc317t3,I disagree with you that our traditional notions of positions are complete nonsense.  They are based on a lot of history and examples of how a players size and skillset fits a particular position.  A players own preferences and comfort level playing a particular position are also very important. Horford is  the prototypical PF height. He is a bit undersized against traditional centers. He can both stretch the floor and bang inside also a traditional skillset of a power forward.He himself has said that his natural position is PF and while he can play center he feels more comfortable at the .I know the game is changing with small ball but there can be consequences to playing a player out of their natural position.,bostonceltics,dc3313a,1,t5_2qmkf

But why in the world would we trade our best young player? If were going to trade a guard Bradley is the super obvious guy we send. People are too hung up on calling everyone a point guard but both Fultz and Monk are just as easily going to be offball guards and IT often plays better offball too. Smart can easily be the starting guard next to ITas hes shown in Bradleys absenceand the Celtics actually do marginally better with IT and Smart on the floor than IT and Bradley. I dont put much stock into  but the point is that IT has played approximately half of his minutes with Smart on the floor and hes done it effectively.Smart is also by far our most versatile guard meaning that if we do have a logjam at the position hes the guy that makes various lineups work. I could not possibly understand why anyone would want to trade our  year old guard whos one of our best players and still getting better every season and then talk about building for the future in the same sentence. As for dont make a trade to make a trade  we wont get much for him uh yeah you dont make a trade just to make a trade especially if the value we get back isnt close to his value on our team. Youre talking about trading our best young player and you dont care what we get in return? So are you cool with cutting him?

10615422,0,t3_5rsjj5,Demarcus Cousins would be the ideal player for the Celtics to trade for imo. With that being said its unlikely the Kings trade him.My trade targets this season would be Nerlens Noel and Jusuf Nurkic. Starting with the Celtics needs and leaving the money aspect out of it a solid big who can ultimately help on the rebounds and play Center with Al Horford on the floor. Avery Bradley leading the team in rebounds per game is not a recipe for playoff success.Ideally the Celtics wouldnt have to give up a ton in return for either Noel or Nurkic. Which means they can add to the rotation without trading away any of the Celtics key role players.With a ton of assets across the board from Draft picks young talent on the team and talent not on the rosterZizicYabusele I think a relatively cheap deal for the Celtics with a hugereturn potential could be made.Would like to know everybodys thoughts on what would be a realistic but ideal trade package in return for either playerNerlens NoelOrJusuf Nurkic,bostonceltics,ddawffq,3,t5_2qmkf

Hes had to carry the team through the entire season that has to be tiring. There were plays yesterday where his guys who drive to the basket and  literally fall flat on their face and all Fultz can do is just try not to lose his cool. Again hes been dealing with that crap through the entire season. Another thing that feeds into thay mentality of him playing halfhearted is how quiet he is. Guys like Kawhi and Jeremy Lamb.

Pacers vs Cavs CAVS WIN.  Wanted a Pacers win but alas it was not meant to be. Would have liked to close the gap for  but its not the end of the world.  Raptors  Minesota MINESTOA WINS Fake  seed loss is always funny. This is so good. Hawks vs Nuggets HAWKS WIN. Needed a Nuggets win Hawks are still rolling and are only close enough for us to keep an eye out. Any losses for them were welcomed. Still they arent breathing down our necks. Suns  Grizz GRIZZ WINSuns are our direct competitors for the  pick theres breathing room but still a win for them would have been welcomed. Bucks vs Heat HEAT WINReally funny to see Heat not tanking still the  Winstreak is impressive another win for them cant hurt. Spurs  ers SPURS WIN. Great for us if ers did win. It didnt happen still they are far ahead of BKN so no biggie.  Lakers  Pistons PISTONS WIN .HMM Lakers win would have been nice anything to stop them from having better lottery odds. Lmao. Damn it. Jazz  Norleans JAZZ WINA Pelicans win would be nice maybe its time to start caring about our record in comparison with the whole league if we want to push IT into a legit MVP candidate.  Clippers  Knicks CLIPPERS WIN A Knicks win would have been good it could have further screwed up Clippers seeding and who knows maybe the tough Playoff road can make CP and Blake want to actually test free agency. Bulls  GSW Um a GSW loss is always a good time.All in all  of the  games directly affect our standings only thing we need to worry about are the Cavs Raptors Wizards and Hawks.,bostonceltics,ddijtc3,4,t5_2qmkf

10696096,0,t1_ddj7pzf,We just have to look for him and find him in his spots. I hate how we had him offensively. We basically ask him to force his way to a bucket by playing bully ball down low. Thats not what his game is. Hes not the guy that posts up bigs and scores over them. He needs to get the ball in the right spots to score like the midrange the  open looks under the basket generated by dribble penetration which the Hawks did a lot. Hes a lot of things but a goto scorer he is not. Its the wrong offensive strategy to ask him to shoot a post fadeaway and once he misses it dont go back to him for the rest of the quarter. ,bostonceltics,ddj80zj,13,t5_2qmkf

Worst case scenario you can trade down for a lower pick and a bench piece or future pick. There will also need to be an honest discussion on if the Celtics want to give Isaiah superstar money. Im not saying he doesnt deserve it but you could potentially draft a franchise PG have him run the bench for a year and develop him. Butler or PG are absolutely enticing and Im not completely opposed to trading for them but I dont want to lose the option of drafting a potential superstar PG that could be a staple on the team for  years,bostonceltics,de2ons8,1,t5_2qmkf

I would think Jaylen the Nets pick one of the Euro Stash guys a contract to make the deal work and maybe a filler guy like D Jax or Mickey may work.  Then they can tank and get a lotto pick of their own. Bradley probably wont work for them because he only has a year left before his contract is up and would probaly leave.  Crowder may be someone they want since he has a friendly contract for the next  years but thats also why the Celtics probably wont trade him.,bostonceltics,de30d4o,1,t5_2qmkf

Yes hes got a good instinct for the ball and is damn strong so hell get what  per game? But hell open a lot of space for Crowder Avery Isaiah to go for the ball. I think it all depends on how the team plays around Bogut if we do sign him. I mean Horford might end up averaging  rebounds a game if Bogut boxes out or vice versa but its not as if Andrew will just plant a flag in our paint and claim every single ball. Takes team effort for that..Because it seems like Al is always chasing somebody. If hes covering opposing Center they play through the PF or PG if he covers the PF they play through the paint. Hes always somewhere in between guarding players and protecting the paint. With Bogut he wont have to worry about doing everything.

You made me look at some of the numbers though and I think I agree. While the name of an allstar is great Hayward statistically isnt a giant leap over Crowder. Theyre very similar except in advanced stats where Hayward has BPM over Crowder.Realistically though he also probably doesnt sign here. Having Stevens is great but hed probably have to play quite a few minutes out of position with our glut of smallwings and lack of bigs. Is he okay with being a second banana?

Marcus is a bulldog and I LOVE his style and intensity but that much money would be too much for someone who cant provide something at an elite level.If Marcus wanted somewhere in the realm of mil a year and IT still wanted a max I feel like wed be able to use the extra cap space to find some extra offensive firepower to replace IT.

There are  players this season who Thomas has zero argument over what someone does with their th place vote doesnt matter.Okay but anyone wouldnt have as strong of a case as IT. I mean I think you can admit if hes the  player on your list hes in the conversation. By extension we shouldnt consider the  player either because they wont win. gt If we are going to look at value added by a singular player Thomas does even worse as we would start considering players who are better but stuck on worse teams as well as bring Curry and Durant back into the conversation.But thats not the MVP award. The MVP award is most valuable player not most stuck on a worse team player or might be most valuable if they didnt have other integral teammates making huge contributions. Its MOST VALUABLE player period. By the strict definition yeah you could make an argument. Again I wouldnt give him the trophy but Im not gonna sit here and act like because hes not Lebron James or Russell Westbrook level talent he isnt arguably just as VALUABLE to his team. He is close.

Whether a shot is a make or miss isnt simply about having good mechanics if it were that simple then the people with the best mechanics would rarely miss. Even Ray Allen probably one of the best and most consistent shooting forms the league has ever seen missed all the time.

There are a million other things Marcus needs to work on in his game and THAT was the one thing he chose to talk about working on this offseason? Really? It makes you wonder if he truly worked on anything at all.To me Smart is like a combination of Sully and Rondo. Sully in that he bust his ass on the court but I question his maturity conditioning and work effort off the court. Sully never improved. What areas has Marcus improved on year to year? Hes like Rondo in that hes a passfirst PG who thinks hes better than he is offensively and takes too many shots. Especially when holding the ball for the last shot at the end of quarters. Never understood why Rondo one of our worst shooters did it and now Smart does it constantly. Its frustrating. Also the attitude stuff like yellingfighting with coaches and players. Sorry maybe this isnt the place to post this but Ive been holding back for a while on Marcus. Especially lately he seems lethargic out there.

11595212,0,t1_dgab0mx,I agree that Porzingis isnt the ideal pairing next to Horford but he is  Im looking past Horford and am dreaming of a future with Porzingis and guys like Smart Brown and whoever else we can draft with the Brooklyn picks after having made a trade. Horfords advantage in defense is his quickness at the  position which holds up against anyone. At the  Horford isnt quick enough to play against a good modern offense. I wouldnt call Horford a plodder because he isnt quick enough to play down a position against teams like the Cavs Warriors and Rockets and I reject the characterization of Porzingis being a plodder on the defensive end.While Porzingis isnt Draymond Green at the  position he is quick enough to use his length and size to great effect on the defensive end.,bostonceltics,dgabqj8,1,t5_2qmkf

Fuck sake I knew it would piss me off and it did. gtNow this year Brad has achieved the one seed with lets be perfectly honest a roster that has no business getting there and now the narrative has flipped. Im seeing coaches ahead of Stevens spoelstra Snyder etc. that overachieved despite not making the playoffs or finishing as a four seed or lower. If thats the case than why the hell was stevens not on ballots the past two years?!?OH BUT SEE HE HAD A PLAYOFF TEAM AND HE CANT DEFEAT ANY TEAMS IN TOP ???? fuck all those cunts who dont include Stevens in COTY right behind Pop. Not to mention that when the Cs played this year you could count on them grinding games out almost any night. Whenever the Spurs played you had to worry if Pop would rest all of his starters or just  of them. Hes got one of the top  players in the league on the most important position in the NBA AND Aldridge AND Gasol AND a team that has been carefully built for DECADES. Stevens got Isaiah. This topic pisses me off more than anything. I dont even understand why DAntoni is in this list hes got a guy averaging  for fuck sake. Stan Van Gundy could win the NBA with Harden. What did he achieve? Hes known as a pure offensive coach so what is his praise? He got the team to shoot threes? He got Harden to try on defense? What? Where does this amazing feat of his lie?Edit we have SCRAPS LITERALLY FUCKING SCRAPS and were  in East. th guard on the bottomfeeding Suns benchwarmer in Dallas who had no SF at the time Amir Injury Johnson and Bradley.

Not a lot of people watch NBA here its growing and not many are Celtics fans with the Raptors being relevant for once. The few Celtics fans I do meet are extreme casuals. Regardless on game days Im always sporting some kind of Celtics gear. Working in TV animation I dont have to wear a suit or anything to work. Im often wearing Celtics gear at work and then changing into different Celtics gear at the gym after work. That is unless Im lazy about doing laundry...gtOne of these days happened a few weeks ago. I was at the gym doing my thing when this guy asked for help with his bench press. I helped him out and we chatted a bit. Ive met the guy a few times nice enough dude but he really just wants to say what he has to say and doesnt really listen to whomever hes talking to. I thought it was a little strange how he selfishly barreled through conversations. Anyway were doing our individual workouts but I keep helping him out for a few more sets. He finishes up and thanks me.gtThats when he put his Los Angeles Lakers hat back on..The moral of the story is always do your laundry ALWAYS REP.

11654278,0,t3_667j6b,Brad deserves some of the blame. Here are some schematic things that didnt work that he was to blame for.. Playing two bigs when the Mirotic is playing the  for the Bulls. Having Horford in there to guard a perimeter player doesnt help the rebounding. We arent going to make up for our lack of size at the  with more size and less quickness at the .. Switching too often. Brads defensive scheme for the playoffs has been too switch heavy. The Bulls are dictating every match up when they have the ball.. Poor rotations. He had an entire season to figure out what the best lineups are still tinkering in the playoffs is not going to work.. Lack of plays to combat teams blitzingtrapping the Isaiah pick and roll. Atlanta rolled out this strategy a year ago and Brad still hasnt found a way to combat it.Now I love Brad but absolving him of blame is not accurate.,bostonceltics,dgh0z9u,2,t5_2qmkf
11654497,0,t3_66b0g6,Id say completely the opposite.  The strength of the Celtics all season was its ability to have its bench come in and provide quality minutes .  Now in the playoffs the strategy has completely changed. The lineups are different. Rozier doesnt even get in the game for game . Green and Jerebko dont see the floor in game .  Jaylen Jerebko Green Rozier playing significant less minutes.   The starters with their additional minutes have looked careless and lethargic through the first two game.
