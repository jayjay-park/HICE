He mocked the concept of having food rotting in cars waiting until someone orders it.  Kalanicks wooden and repetitive blunt answers were if anything selfroasting.  The idea of just in time food delivery could have been far better explained by someone with communication skills.  And it appears you dont seem to understand that driverless cars would be a threat to the drivers I cant help make the obvious any more Uberobvious.  The hype about autonomous cars will mirror the hype about D pettiness and how theyd be printing out diamonds and filet mignon.

5694769,0,t1_cx2zel1,They dont like each other and he knew what he was getting in to.Their acts are like diametric opposites of each other. Maher likes to be brutally honest and doesnt dance around subjects. Hes raw and unrefined in his take on things. His show is unscripted and he loves the hot political discourse that ensues in a semichaotic atmosphere.Colbert is more calculated and uses satire and sardonicism to make his points. Hes polished and hes definitely more quickwitted than Maher. But my problem with Colberts interview style is probably the same thing that gets under Mahers skin. Colbert can sweep the rug out from under you in the middle of a sentence. Hes sort of like a magician and if he feels the conversation taking a direction he doesnt like hell throw some misdirection out there to change the topic or turn the conversation back on the person whos talking.Maher was more subdued than usual if you ask me. He tried to sit and get through a thought and it looked like he was getting tired of Colberts constant interference in the middle of an idea. And since its not his show he doesnt have the same freedoms he does in his own studio and cant steer the ship because Colbert has a more boisterous and animated personality and can take over a room with his style. Its like two captains trying to steer the same ship from opposite ends. ,LateShow,cx2zorz,78,t5_31ar3

8451254,0,t1_d5wp2cp,Colbert is the intellectual of the bunch. Hes into politics science and literature. He can deliver a mean monologue and make references beyond the other hosts. Its a debate whether hes the funniest or has the best executed show but damn it if he isnt smart.He has stated that he has a lot of fun jumping into pop culture and being more silly and trivial. Its been a tough balancing act because hes trying to have it all it seems. Everyone has different expectations for him and its impossible to please everyone but that seems to be his goal so far. Ive enjoyed the show and I feel like with time hell just get better and people need to stop blasting him for not being precisely this or that off the bat.,LateShow,d5xxyrw,7,t5_31ar3

Just makes you think how goofy he must be with his own kids.  I love being a fan of this show. Its getting better and better each day!
