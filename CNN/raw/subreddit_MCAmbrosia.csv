3443590,0,t3_2zmxwh,gt Id like to open the land near the old farm for developmentBut youre leaving the farm there right? I mean I know its just a crappy little farm but I always like to leave the base camp in a city.gt Wyndy has introduced a bunch of Ambrosians to Varjs Fally Death GameIt is fun shame about the death message spam   I did open a simple modreq and have a very quick word with Scherp  theres a history of death messages being considered chat spam and theres no way to selectively turnoff death messages so unfortunately Ill be staying away from varjs Shaft from now on or only be on it when theres a very few people about.  Fun though the whole thing is I dont want to annoy people or give other people an opening to generate phoney outrage.gt UnderbrosiaAll I have to say about this is just as we are not exactly rocket scientists we are not exactly normal either.My own addition to this post is that unfortunately the four things Ive currently got on my todo list stupid machinery Ambrosia suburb zombie villager curing hospital work on the waterways do something with archery I dont know what are currently stuck in the mud.  Ive a mountain of things to do IRL and exams in a few months time but I dont want to drop P at all its one of the few things that keeps me relatively sane.That having been said Im going to have to start rationing my  time a little and not just popping on derping around then leaving again.

6111612,0,t1_cyjxw4r,oAs far as lag goes the first few days of a new Rev the lag is always a bit bananas purely because of the number of people on.  As for the lag specific to Rev  Im not entirely in the know on this but as far as Im aware the root causes lay in certain plugins and these have now been corrected.
