2645468,0,t3_2q3m2e,I know that this may violate the rules of this contest however I am nominating a part epic that I shall refer to as the Rum Ham Saga. In these episodes of Space Engineers Coes ship is set adrift and Millbee and Guude depart to save it. Will they succeed? Will they fail? Will they themselves need saving in the end?Simply put the events that unfold across these  episodes are some of the most compelling and entertaining content I have ever seen a Mindcracker produce.
