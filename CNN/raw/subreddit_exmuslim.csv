54218,0,t1_cekjlx1,I think Maliks point was that racial science was irrational as well but not from a scientific but rather a philosophical humanist point of view. It was science tainted with the prejudices of the time. Meaning for example that there for sure are genetic differences among different population groups also obviously between male and female but those dont constitute a reason for one group having no rights or having a certain place in social hierarchies race in that sense is not a biological concept. Maliks point is as far as I understood  and here he differs strongly from Sam Harris  that science itself is not moral or immoral but that we need moral philosophy to make that difference. So on the one hand there is the scientific method that corrects itself but there must also be normative criticism concerning the methods and results of scientific inquiry and what they mean for society how do we know after all if we dont again became victims of prejudices.  About Ibn Khaldun I think there is no problem to view him as a great man of his time that he was racist cannot be denied one could argue though that this must be seen in context of his other achievements and the times just like with Thomas Jefferson. As long as people are aware of this and dont try to revive those ideas of his like taking him as an authoritive source to institute racial discrimination I dont see the problem with having a statue of him in downtown Tunis or Cairo. Its much more important that the real racist stereotypes that are around today are combated. ,exmuslim,ceklphv,1,t5_2s7k2

Causality has been implanted in our lizard brain and everything needs to have a reason. Feeling depressed without any real life cause is very distressing and causes you to make up reasons.

It wasnt proper for a lady to be running around in the street like that. And what if my hymen broke? I was ten.I hide my tampons from my mom but not very well honestly. I would definitely snap if she tried lecturing me about them. I feel as if I was lied to my entire life.

Moving to Pune in  he established an ashram which attracted a growing number of Westerners.

However Muhammads SAW role in this world was not just to be a nice guy to everyone.  There were establishments of law and also their enactments.  So when laws were violated punishments were given out.  Additionally Islam values the right of the victim to retribution far more than it does the criminals right to mercy.  Yes the Quran does say if one was to pardon a criminal it is what God loves but the right to punish is not taken away.  Additionally I want you to keep in mind that the crime was also highway banditry.  I would argue this is the modern day equivalent of terrorism.

They do however penalize sexual acts between men as extramarital sex.Guys guys theyre totally okay with gays. As long as they dont act gay or be gay or do anything gay or that kind of thing but thats totally not the same as being against them okay?gtBrunei already punishes homosexual acts with  years imprisonment under its colonialera law. Probably as in Pakistan which also formally embraced Sharia years ago most gay cases will be tried under that provision because proof is easier. The Syariah code will be a looming threat but not an imminent danger.Its ok that there are super antigay laws because theyre nothing new! Stop getting so worked up people have been bigoted douchebags for ages already! gtBut it will be different for women as the law controls even their appearance and movements.

Theyre hating on women much more than they hate on gays! Why cant people just complain about just one group thats being fucked over instead of ALL of them?gtHere then is the question. Why are gay bloggers Tweeters and groups like Human Rights Campaign hyping this as an antigay law? Obviously because they havent talked to anybody in Brunei or elsewhere in the region. They especially havent consulted feminist groups in South and Southeast Asia who could clue them in on the impact of these laws..............So yeah Im from Southeast Asia the impact is that nothing changes for the better and everyone is as fucked as always.

Let us not forget that there are people who fall into this category.gtIndifference to the broader issues at stake to the fate of women in Brunei and to the work of feminists throughout the region is disgraceful. It endangers LGBT Bruneians by turning the dispute over the Syariah code into a battle solely of the Sultan vs. the gays. It damages regional womens movements by relegating their campaigns again to silence.

1239893,0,t3_28adeo,Well he didnt really know that many stories at all. And of the stories that he knew the details were often very vague far vaguer than the bible. The bible tended to give names dates locations years etc. which are pretty much entirely missing from the quran. Its important to understand that the society Muhammad grew up in and traveled within to places like Damascus was very oral in tradition. There was an abundance of story tellers and people learned and retained information from others instead of from books. This lead the way for story variation and the inclusion of apocrypha such as the Samaritan and Moses Alexander romance seven sleepers etc. that seems to be exhibited in the quran.I was never really impressed with the stories because they were always light on details and very short. I never thought it was outside Muhammads capabilities to recount what he recounted because it seems like what biblical myth would sound like if put through a th century oral tradition blender.I guess its also interesting that the people of mecca supposedly them never really stated outright in quran are recounted in the Q as having some knowledge of what he was talking about.... Even when they come to you arguing with you those who disbelieve say This is not but legends of the former peoples.

CE  Arabic  transliteration ishah aia also transcribed as Aishah Aisyah Ayesha Aisha Aishat Aishah or Aisha was one of Muhammad wives.  In Islamic writings her name is thus often prefixed by the title Mother of the Believers Arabic   umm almumin per the description of Muhammads wives in the Quran   gtTraditional Hadith sources state that Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six but she stayed in her parents home until the age of nine when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad then  in Medina    alTabari born in Persia two hundred years after Muhammads death wrote that she was ten years old. gtAccording to Sunni views Aisha had an important role in early Islamic history both during Muhammads life and after his death. She was an active figure in numerous events and an important witness to many more. Aisha contributed to the growth development and understanding of Islam. Being a role model to a significant amount of others added to her attributions as a consultant regarding Muhammads prayer and practices soon introducing herself into a world of politics. gtAfter Muhammad Aisha was readily involved in continuing his message. She was present through the reigns of at least the first four caliphs Her father Abu Bakr became the first caliph to succeed Muhammad. The second caliph Umar succeeded Ab Bakr. During the time of the third caliphs reign Aisha rebelled. She did not fully approve of Uthman ibn Affan practices on many occasions. During the reign of Ali the fourth caliph she wanted to avenge Uthmans death which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel She participated in the battle by giving speeches and leading troops on the back of her camel. She ended up losing the battle but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression. gtgtImage iInteresting Aisha  film | Aisha Campbell | Aisha name | Aisha reggae singer Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcihcfcn oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecihcfcn.

Its the remaining  of common humanity that we love yet which each religion claims to be the gate keeper of.My own pride doesnt let me convert to this shittiest of religions.

There were also times when I got pretty depressed due to reallife circumstances and it was in those moments when I realized that good Muslims around the world who had done nothing wrong in their lives my family included were suffering for no reason. It was in these moments that I truly started to lose faith in Islam.At times you will be depressed and many other times you will clash heads with family and friends. But in the end depending on which way you go you may end up getting the feeling of liberation. Thats how I view it. Sure I still have to pray and fast forced by family but at least I feel I dont have to chain myself to Islam and that I can for example avoid drinking and smoking because I personally feel that its bad for me or that I can be nice to people and do good deeds because I think its the right thing to do for humanity.TLDR you may feel depressed and worried at times but in time youll feel free as a bird. ,exmuslim,ciw2m27,1,t5_2s7k2

Fasting in Islam means you give up ALL food ALL drinkincluding water and also youre not allowed to smoke take medicines use inhalers and have injections. If you do  however have a condition which requires regular meds or if e.g. youre pregnant then you are technically exempt from fasting.. I remember some elders telling me that in the olden days people ued to refrain from speaking or smelling strong smells e.g. a rose. The point of Ramadan is to focus on religion and not other aspects of life which you have the rest of the  months for and taking part in dancingmusic during ramadan is looked down on during Ramadan. Also disneyland can wait after ramadanmusic is actually not allowed by more strict muslims maybe on Eid BIG celebration marking the end of ramadan.Orthodox Islam itself actually does mandate something similar to a burka as the dress of females in public however in most parts of the Islamic world this has become reduntand when not enforced and the clothing of women in islamic societiesfamilies is highly influenced by culture which includes religion and the social class the woman comes from. It is hard to generalise but best to think of the head covering as a symbolic religious item which you cant change but there is leniency in changing everything else depending on the two factors mentioned above However dont expect to see a woman in a short skirt with scarf.

In phenomenological language it may still be acceptable to speak of the place where the sun sets when it is done from the view point of someone who is far away from this place. For example a traveler could say that he was moving in direction of where the sun is setting. However the Quran goes beyond what is possible in phenomenological language when it states that ZulQarnain reached the place where the sun sets i.e. the Quran is speaking of a human being who traveled to the place of the setting of the sun. Such a statement is wrong in any kind of language since such a place does not exist on this earth. This is a serious error that was introduced into the Quran because the author mistook a legend to be literal and historical truth.,exmuslim,cj3b0pk,2,t5_2s7k2

Muslims are human beings just like you and me. Most of the ones that have GROWN UP in the west have a respect for basic human rights. Those that dont have that respect are likely the ones that are going to push for power when they gain a majority. The good news however is that regardless of the popularization of the Islam is the fastest growing religion trend according to rates atheism is the fastest growing in the West both NA and Europe. The reason Islam is said to be the fastest growing is because the countries with big populations are just getting bigger in population. So the good news is by  it is far more likely that atheists are going to be predominantly running the world than radical muslims.,exmuslim,cjefhbt,1,t5_2s7k2

1763187,0,t1_ck1d7c4,gtInterestingly you havent addressed the actual verse and my comment. Claiming its a contradiction doesnt make it so. Please feel free to actually address the comment directly.I have already said why its a contradiction. It says the law isnt in effect but that the law wont go away. You commentary on this hasnt clarified it at all. So I dont know what youd like me to address you havent given me any reason to believe this scripture is anything other then saying the law is gone but its not gone. which is a contradiction.gtSo youre now saying that Christ did teach differently to what was taught in the Old Testament?I have always said this do you not understand what a contradiction is? This is exactly what a contradiction is. gtThis is not contradictory to what I have claimed throughout. The Law and the Prophets are to be eternally appreciated in substance but their application as indicated in scripture Jeremiah  Hebrews  Matthew  Luke  is no longer a necessity. eternally appreciated but no longer a necessity. How does this not alarm you? Youre endorsing the old testament but saying its no longer necessary how is this not a contradiction in and of itself?I have addressed the verses over and over and over again. I feel like we are either talking past each other or you just arent reading what Im saying. They are contradictions because they do not agree with one another. Either the law is gone or its not youre verses havent clarified it one iota.gtLuke  I highlight the context which you do not address.Did you not read what I said? I did address it. If you read it its clearly a command. A command is when someone give a direct order. This is a direct order. You just said it was metaphoric. How do you know which scriptures are metaphoric vs literal or commands? Normally when someones day bring them here and kill them in front of me Thats a command and a very specific one. The fact that he gave this command shows that every peace thing he said is a direct contradiction. This isnt the only violence verse but all it takes is ONE violent verse to make all the peaceful verses contradictions. gtNot exactly particularly when youre not addressing anything directly.I guess Im not addressing anything? I think we are talking past one another. There seems to be some misunderstanding in our communication. Definition of contradiction a combination of statements ideas or features of a situation that are opposed to one another. Are you thinking of some other definition on contradiction? Is there something Im missing I really dont understand why you arent understanding my points.gtFeel free to post them.Just skip down to the new testament where you think that the law starts to apply. gtAbsolutely youre right. Although Christ didnt wed that doesnt mean we cant. But thats not what I said. Instead it was His ministry that did not engage in stoning. This ministry did things that Christ didnt necessarily do such as marry and have children but they did not once stone.I dont understand how this addresses my point. He very specifically says let him die the death for not honouring they father and mother. This is a specific violent teaching. Youre context didnt make it any better I dont see anything that indicates this is not the meaning of what hes saying. You then stated that since he didnt do it he didnt mean it that way. I noted he doesnt do things that he endorsers such as marriage that in no way invalidates what he endorses. Your counter arguement that he didnt do it seem logically inconsistent. So my point still stands that he said that children dying is an acceptable outcome of not honouring your parents. Which is a violent teaching and as such contradicts his peaceful teachings.gtgtIf you love me keep my commands.John  You should really be killing nonbelievers.gtThis has been addressed. Until you directly tackle the verse I suggest you look at my previous comment on Luke .I dont see how you addressed it beside saying its not a commandment or that its metaphorical which I dont accept either as being true since its a pretty specific command. Which Ive talked about above.gtIts quite obvious that Im not ignoring scripture when Im elaborating on them. Once again blanket comments dont mean much. Feel free to quote scripture. Also I think it would be best to transfer this to PM.I guess its not ignoring you simply have a personal elaboration that makes it okay in your mind. Im trying to understand why you think they arent contradiction. Please spend more time thinking about Luke . Can you understand how that looks like a contradiction? Can you see why Im confused by your use of that verse? I gave specific examples of contradictions the command to kill a nonbeliever and you seem to respond to me with more contradictions peaceful verses to emphasize your original contradiction. It kind of feels like a blanket statement because you keep doing it. You do understanding if you give me  verses that are evidence that Jesus taught peacefulness so giving me more peaceful verses doesnt make your point only continues to prove it that if he teaches one single verse that is violent all  verses become contradictions so if you want to show that there isnt a contradiction you need to make a compelling argument for why they arent violent every single violent verse Must believers in Abrahamic religions just rely on divine commend as evidence that its good but thats not good from a secular perspective. I dont know what difference it would make to transfer it but Id rather not if we have to I prefer to allow other to see discussion because you rarely if ever convince someone that strongly disagree with you so I just wouldnt find it  as valuable a discussion. ,exmuslim,ck1emxb,1,t5_2s7k2

That way you basically only have to interact with your parents from around  to  pm. Instead of being silent you can also contribute to the conversation. Sometimes parents just want to feel connected to their kids so theyll start some boring azz topic and when their kids are not into it they feel more lonely and try to put even more restrictions to keep you close.

In fact in Jordan even the tech illiterate and those with meager incomes will generally have an Android phone and they will at least be using Whatsapp and Facebook.Edit Dont forget that this map plots devices connected rather than people connected thus you are going to see a massive difference between economically well off countries and poorer countries as those in the more prosperous countries will have multiple devices connected to the internet compared to a poorer nation where the majority may only have  or  devices at most.,exmuslim,ckkhf6o,2,t5_2s7k2

Many people do because its easier for them.Addressing those many people it doesnt make what theyre believing in any more or less true just because its easier for them. If thats truly one of their reasons then we are in a sad state if people are perfectly content with mental stasis.gtBut the thing is in this paragraph it seems your really starting to commit a logical sin which is Ad Hominem. Could you put a quote on exactly where I committed Ad Hominem? I tried to look through what I wrote but wasnt sure on what you were referencing. Also I would never purposely counteract an argument by attacking the debater personally. It is one of the weakest things someone could do in a debate. Its used to deflect what the opponent is saying by stirring up an irrelevant personal observation which is ludicrous. Perhaps I did that on accident or was misunderstood? Again I hope you understand and point out to me where I may have done that. However I might try and take a guess at what youre thinking is Ad Hominem. Maybe youre referencing the entire paragraph with the sheikh? If so then that isnt anything like Ad Hominem. For one thing I never made any personal attack against anyone in that paragraph. And secondly the purpose of that paragraph was to provide an anecdote to provide more context for the larger point that I was leading up to. For example when I said His command at the English language and his strong rhetoric could convince anyone of anything my intention in writing this was to illustrate how despite his strong rhetoric and his ability to convince Muslims in strengthening their iman his argument still fell short for me and nothing about the way he could string his words together was able to mask the faults I perceived in Islam. So if this is what you were saying was bordering on Ad Hominem then know that the paragraph was anecdotal and contextual certainly not deflective.gtNow what I meant by social norms is...Really will put things into perspective for you. Quoting this whole paragraphI read through the page and listened to the transcript. One of the only things it put into perspective for me was that you could apply your line of argument where you said What I am trying to get at is compare present day society with what is bad in Islam... by substituting Islam with Christianity. It would barely make a difference. And no I dont point this out just because Paul Harveys speech was based upon Christianity. But you can see that many Christians especially of the fundamentalist strain say similar things to what you said in that paragraph   to compare what the Bible says is wrong to whats taking place today. Yes you did add Im not saying that this proves Islam but should def be taken into consideration. Give Christianity a chance then. The Christians definitely think you should.gtIn terms of the nonduality thing I think your misunderstanding the idea of good loving merciful etc. Ill explain using the characteristic of good. Basically anything is good in Islam only because God said its good.You think Im misunderstanding but I think you missed my point  that its incredulous for an omnipotent being to have any characteristics even good ones. It does not matter how appealing the characteristics of good merciful loving caring etc. are. People may find it convincing enough because it may appeal to what is pleasant in any sane human being. But the fact is that its impossible for a deity to be so high and so ultimate yet presumably separate from our world of matter yet at the same time possessing very human characteristics no matter which way we spin it. I remember how as a Muslim and still now since I interact with them every day where the Muslims would get a bit of a kick out of mentioning the flaws of Christianity ultimately leading up to why Islam is the true religion. Doing things like attacking the concept of the trinity and pointing out how irrational it is and such. One thing I know the Muslims around me like to point out is how the Islamic conception of god is superior to the Christian conception of it because in Islam Allah has no human attributes. He is never drawn nor portrayed. He is beyond the simplistic notions that the Christians hold of him and so on.As humans ourselves though its easy to unintentionally overlook human qualities in any thing or object in the same way how it is easy for an English speaker to forget that not everyone conceives of the world within English thoughts. And this is why I think its easy for Muslims to not notice that something like the fact that Allah has  names. Please think about that why a being who is supposedly beyond humanity has  attributes. Heres something  the st and nd names of Allah AdDarr and AnNafi  the creator of the harmful and the creator of the good. Allah is supposed to be the ultimate of all the attributes of him he supposedly gives to us. How can he be the ultimate of all things harmful and yet the ultimate of all things good and beneficial? Some people may not see any logical problem in this but if Allah is supposed to be the ultimate of his attributes possessing an infinite amount of such qualities then this would have to meanA. The two qualities cancel each other out amounting to Allah being neither orB. Allah is not monodeistic there is more than one deity...it just isnt possible for Allah to be the ultimate of two very opposite things yet still be one entity. A possible rebuttal to that point would be the assertion that human beings are fallible and do not have the ability to understand everything. Allah is incredibly complex and beyond our conception. However according to Islam Allah creates human beings to test them to see whether they will believe in him or not. So its essential that mankind must reason their way to Islam since thats the test...yet Allah does not give you all the materials youll need but still expects you to figure it out. If you agree with the rebuttal I predicted you would have to admit that its devious. To understand what Im getting at better Ill provide the example of a math class. The teacher says that at the end of the term there will be a large exam. The students will be tested on their knowledge of the topics taught throughout the term. They must choose the correct answers.  But the teacher only instructs them on chapters  but the tests covers questions from chapters ! So saying that its impossible for humans to completely understand Allah in this life the test would also be to admit that Allah is deceptive he purposely deprived us of all the materials we needed. He only gave us up to chapter  but punishes harshly when we obviously failed on chapter . Indeed he is truly alBatin.,exmuslim,ckpvwj7,1,t5_2s7k2

2022762,0,t3_2hoydl,The reason science cant answer how the universe started is that we do not have sufficient evidence at this time. Since people of various religions are scientists but do not submit hypotheses derived from their scriptures to peerreviewed journals it would seem that scriptures are not sufficient evidence either. Although to be fair I dont really see the necessary conflict between religion in its broad sense and science. Science is a method of amassing knowledge. Religion is a method of making meaning. Science can disprove specific religious claims but meaning making as a process is something everyone does all the time even when they dont associate it with gods or scriptures or institutions or labels. Even before the scientific method was elaborated there were apostates and atheists making pretty good arguments. Creationism is dumb though. You dont even need modern science to realize that. Augustine and Jerome were early Christians who rejected literal readings of Genesis. To wit AugustineETA Sorry for the giant quote. Editing...Usually even a nonChristian knows something about the earth the heavens and the other elements of this world... Now it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture talking nonsense on these topics and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. ...If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead the hope of eternal life and the kingdom of heaven when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.,exmuslim,ckwxtwv,1,t5_2s7k2

So not Islam!You cant just pick which culture is Islamic or not. And then bail out look the other way claim its not Islam when its bad.If Hadith is unnecessary then praying is just a culture.That guy claiming not to be a muslim really?Good god not the zakat and jizya again!

2120395,0,t3_2j86gj,I am sorry for your pain and suffering over these years. One thing you must realize is that you were indoctrinated. You were force fed dogma from the day you were born. It is difficult to let go of the ideas of religions because they are constantly referred to as Good.With this in mind you can easily see that the greatest weapon on individual scale is SHAME.Look around you feel shame for being who you are girls are shamed from an early age to feel submissive boys are shamed as well and often time they are burdened with their own shame and the shame of their families.  I could go on and on but you must see the shame for what it is. It is a tactic used to make people feel worthless and to give up their individual power and rights to holy men. They want you to cower in their presence and give them benefits and privileges for doing nothing but judging and spouting bullshit.When you see it for what it is you may feel bad for believing it for so long and disliking yourself so much. But dont. I mean really what other information were you given to compare?As for the peace that everyone else seems to have it is that they traded their own thought and mind in exchange for a little peace of mind. I would say they have become robots. They have stopped questioning because everyone else has. It is a mob mentality and any who have legitimate questions are  told shut up and submit! Sometimes with a few beatings for good measure. Look at the rexmuslim sub and you will see how many people fear for their lives or for losing their homes or their relations to brothers and sister. And why? Because they dont BELIEVE a far fetched story with zero evidence or even logical cohesiveness. Or they are gay through no direct choice of their own or they dont want to be forced into a box without their own sovereignty.I hope you are safe. Do not put yourself in danger. I dont know where you live but in some places coming out is dangerous.Dont let them make you feel shame you for being who you are.Oh and one last thing. Often people will say you want to leave the faith only to commit sin. But I believe that you want only to be the best person you can be. You seem to be seeking truth so keep seeking. The path may lead away from familiar territory though because much of what you have been told will not hold up to scrutiny. Once again. Be safe. Good luck,exmuslim,cl9cju3,6,t5_2s7k2

2440031,0,t1_cmdakci,andImmorality in IslamWomenif Misogyny had a religion then itd be muslim. What does islam teach men when it comes to women? Quran  Men are in charge of women by right of what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend for maintenance from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in the husbands absence what Allah would have them guard. But those wives from whom you fear arrogance  first advise them then if they persist forsake them in bed and finally strike them. But if they obey you once more seek no means against them. Indeed Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.what if a woman is the one that is providing wealth and is spending from her money to support her family? can a muslim man still beat her? according to Islam the answer is YES! the above verse shows the impotence of an almighty creator that does not know that at sometime in the future women will actually lead invent provide wealth teach and change the world. it is living proof of an immoral code for life and also proof that the quran is manmade. Quran  Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have more right to take them back in this period if they want reconciliation. And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them in responsibility and authority. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.a pretty clear and forward verse in the Quran women are commanded to obey without any questions. Women according to this verse CANNOT reconcile its the mans decision to make. A woman is not only divorced and left to deal with her life as she should be especially in our present day but she has to be waiting for  periods in idle status just in case there is a child in her womb. read it in arabic and youll feel the harsh tone of this verse. Quran  ..And call to witness from among your men two witnesses. And if two men be not found then a man and two women..do the math and then tell me if this is a moral treatment of women why would a woman that has  eyes  ears a mouth and a brain be considered as half a human being? Islam regards women as less of a human being than men. according to the above verse an intelligent well educated respected woman would still be counted as half a testimony at court as an illiterate bedouin immoral savage man. Muhammad said Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man? They replied in the affirmative. He said This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Bukhari  Quran  Indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels female namesand Quran  And they have made the angels who are servants of the Most Merciful females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be questionedAngels are pure heavenly perfect clean and supreme beings so they HAVE to have Male names. People who think angels are females will be questioned severely in the afterlife. Is this really a crime? a humanbeing would risk going to hell for naming an angel with a female name. how moral is that? Quran  O you men who have believed when you rise to perform prayer wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of janabah then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.let this verse detonate in your brain read it again and again. Muslim men are told brainwashed from a young age that TOUCHING women is a form of impurity and would require you to wash or worse find clean earth dirt before praying. Again read it yes touching women.a notable Hadith Aisha said to Muhammad You have made us equal to the dogs and the asses Muslim there are many more verses and hundreds of Hadiths that demean women and promote their misery. From stoning to proving rape and from adultery to divorce. Islam is bankrupt of any moral values.Homosexualityhow does Islam regard the affectional or romantic attractions between two humans of the same gender? Islam fails as a religion that came from an almighty allknowing deity at morality and science yet again on the matter of homosexuality. according to Quran  homosexuals are transgressing criminals that did an action that no one has preceded you with from among the worlds?according to scientific evidence Homosexuality occurs in many other creatures behavior and even before Kaum Lot the way the quran describes as the historic beginning of homosexuality historically the story of Lot and Sodom is considered fictitious. The historical existence of Sodom and Gomorrah is still in dispute by archaeologists no evidence of its existence whatsoever.HeavenHeaven in Islam is like a New York city strip club. Limitless sex with unreal virgins lust for handsome boys Quran    and all other sorts of tempting debauchery. glamourous couches  fruit lust wine sex and pleasure of the Vegas standard just for whomever muhammed approves of. Jannah and the description of Jannah for the bedouin arabs at the time was a main factor that had those bedouins head over heels for wine water sex virgins boys and gardens the quran was tailored to their lusts thats how it worked.Women on the other hand are promised none of the above in the after life.Heaven for me personally made me doubt Islam. a manmade story that appealed to the mindset of an arab  years ago from gardens to rivers of water and wine to sex with boys virgins and gold couches.SlaveryQuran  O you who have believed prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered  the free for the free the slave for the slave and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother anything then there should be a suitable followup and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.clear and straightforward the almighty muhammeds imagination wouldve never mentioned slave if he didnt mean it or if slavery didnt exist. slavery and islam are fond of one another some slaves were freed in mecca by muhammed at a time when muhammed needed as many followers and bodyguards as possible but as soon as his armies grew he acquired more slaves from prisoners of war than the number of slaves he freed in the beginning of Islam.Quran  So consume what you have taken of war booty as being lawful and good and fear Allah . Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful indeed he is merciful but not on the poor women children and men of the invaded land. slavery and marriage by force is found in abundance throughout islams history.and from the hadithMuhammads own pulpit  from which he preached Islam  was built with slave labor on his command. Bukhari The Apostle of Allah may peace be upon him sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allah may peace be upon him were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers. So Allah the Exalted sent down the Quranic verse Quran  And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hands possess. Abu Dawud This is the story of verse  in the Quran.allah allowed women to be raped and enslaved infront of their husbands noble indeed.I can go on and on and discuss the immoral islamic teachings of Torture Justifying Murder in the name of allah Religious Freedom Freedom of Speech Apostasy Adultery Proving Rape and many more.and when it comes to Science and how Islam contradicts with modern Scientific facts and how muhammed borrowed from the already existing scientific mindset of his time in Greece Persia and Egypt Islam doesnt stand a chance.Muhammeds real history is full of immoral actions and instructions to his followers. Islam and Allah are just a manifestation of Muhammeds super immoral ego and his lust for power and pleasure.That was just scratching the surface my friend.,exmuslim,cmdakgg,3,t5_2s7k2

Worldly activities were not worth my mosque communities time and many young people were alienated as a result. You will need to make your own community essentially it sucks that you missed out something that others seemed to be given just because you didnt fit in but you need to forge your own trail. A lot of things could have been great if they had all worked out the way youd liked them to but you cant dwell on them. If you havent moved out on your own and you can that would be a first step. If you are in college or have a job find some roommates and move somewhere preferably near or in a big city. Just living with new people exposes you to so many new people and things you wouldnt ordinarily see especially in a city. Start going to the gym find a social sports league to join. Find some nice spots to hike go for a bike riderun get a pet go to concertsfestivals travel etc etc. Just find things you like to do and fill your free time with them. Youre not going to stumble upon a huge supportive group of people overnight.

Maybe western born imams are better at hiding this hate in Islam I still go with my family to mosque with older or foreign imams and the one time I listen to a young imam I found it much better and more tamed.

They turn from great people in  situation to terrifyingly cold bigots the next. People notice these small things and it builds resentment in addition to the attacks. They dont see us as equals when the cards are down. is the best way I can quote how several people feel about Muslims. It feels like if they had the opportunity any nonbelievers of their religion would be eliminated and a very high  of Muslims would be happy for the genocide. I could go on and on with examples but honestly its how I feel too... you can feel the condescension towards nonMuslims strongly at times. I dont want it to happen but if one day massive civil wars break out between Europeans and Muslims... I would not be surprised. It would likely lead to a world war against Muslim countries.There is already a lot of hatred for Muslims across the world. The religion of peace that has people living by standards of the dark ages needs to change especially if they are going to immigrate to first world countries and bring their horrible culture with them or it will be the reason for the rd world war and no one wants that.Anyway I dont want to rant doom and gloom too much and I know its hyperbole but I am honestly worried for the next  years of humanity.

2865591,0,t1_cntmxk1,This is actually the same thing I thought up in college! If youre a theist or even a strict idealogue its extremely difficult for you to think outside that frame of logic. When I was a religious Muslim everything existed within the frame of Islam and therefore the existence of God and miracles. As evidence was provided to me that was contrary to my beliefs I tried squeezing that into that same framework. Eventually my argument used to end up with a mulligan since God can theoretically do anything.I think it takes an inquisitive mind and a real search for truth in order for logic to work through assumptions. I used to be very religious but I was also raised with science on both sides of my family. One thing that really helped me become nonreligoous was this game my dad would have. He would ask my brother me and my sister how random things worked. We would have to look it up or try and figure it out using the most logical process. I think that really helped shape my line of thinking. Unfortunately my dad and mom are still religious but they accept me as someone whos not. Your English is awesome!,exmuslim,cnttgzd,2,t5_2s7k2

2889065,0,t1_cnwf4r8,. Anybody can call things nonsensical few can give legitimate reasons why it is such. . No neither God nor Muhammad would have included information in the QuranHadith that was transparently ahead of its time as that would result in nearly everybody in modern times flocking to Islam due to such obvious scientific miracles. This goes against what God says in the Quran. Below is a copy of something Ive previously written on the subject.I dont believe there are any scientific miracles in the Quran not the cheap kind anyway and that such a concept goes against the basis of Islam.God discussed that if he wanted everyone to believe in him with ease he would have just made humans like angels who always obey God or revealed himself to humanity.Instead however he wants humans to repudiate the Devils claims and prove that when given the choice we will choose to believe in God and his principles faith.A blatantly obvious scientific miracle in the Quran would be tantamount to God simply revealing himself to humanity as only the incredibly stupid wouldnt believe in that situation. Gods made it clear that he doesnt operate that way and we Muslims shouldnt waste our time trying to trap people into believing in God.. A quick breakdown on why I reject Hadith. The method of their collection is laughably unreliable. We Muslims like to make fun of ChristiansJews because their holybooks were preservedtransmitted in an obviously unscrupulous manner yet Hadith are far worse. Hadith contradict each other as well as the Quran.  The only guaranteed source of truth that is good for all timeswithout flaw complete and all humans need according to God is the Quran. No such assurances are given to Hadith. A lot of superstitious nonsense and tribal customs come from Hadith but little in the way of Islam. Salah prayer is described in the Quran. Any extra formulationaddition is by definition unnecessary. Theres also the fact that Salah along with a few other customs is something that was practiced so often by Muslims everywhere since Islams inception that its preservation isnt due to Hadith but to people doing the same thing older Muslims did in a chain back to Muhammad. I apologize for the long comment. ,exmuslim,cnwhnde,1,t5_2s7k2

2895392,0,t3_2tagec,Ive always disliked Islam always ridiculed it and scoffed at the stupidity of Muslims my mother included as a child.The Rushdie affair was the first time I became aware of the widespread stupidity of Muslims and their inability to reason. I decided it was just a class thing none of my family involved themselves in that shit I was fine ...I only began hating it when I got to college. Before then I just thought Muslims were stupid but no more so than the other religious types.At my mostly desi college Hizbies got hold of the student union and began setting up their atrocious bullshit political lectures every fucking week which meant that the fuckwits were always polluting my campus.It got better at uni less of the fuckers though still present. So I basically didnt even think of Muslims until friends of mine began to try and revert me by taking me along to the dog shit that they mistook for intelligent religious argumentation.Once I became reacquainted with the intellectual Muslim I just became thoroughly contemptuous of the entire culture.I mean I can forgive people like my mother they literally know no better they werent educated in the case of my mother because her father was too busy travelling the world and spunking up his portion of the family inheritance and so she was left neglected and marginalised they were psychologically weak and they just needed something to mediate the strange world they faced.Yet educated engineers medical students physicists and computer scientists failing to even register the incoherences and flawedpartial logic of Islamist arguments just seemed bewildering.Still life was good and I was never hampered by the stupidities of Muslims. I kept away from them and became a Left wing activist though not a Socialist or anything that extreme.I rediscovered my loathing for Islam and Muslim culture shortly after . Not because of the attacks but the reaction within Muslim communities and the rise of Muslim Identity bullshit.I believe my hate is only a reactionary phenomena it requires Muslims to dosay stupid shit for me to feel hate.I guess I dont even count myself as an exMuslim because I never identified as a Muslim and I see no point in identifying myself with respect to something that has as much relevance to my selfimage as crocheting.,exmuslim,cnx7kjy,7,t5_2s7k2

Also it is mandatory to pray  times a day in the manner of the prophet. Also slavery is banned as each human has rights and freedoms. Pork and alcohol are also forbidden because I want obedience and you need a clear mind. Also dont have sex slaves or concubines because women are your equals. Take care of the poor. Dont steal or murder or violate another person or their property.  Christians and Jews are close to the truth but they corrupted their holy books. Other religions are further from the truth but you should let them practice in peace... Do all these and you will have heaven with all its pleasures. Disobey them and you risk hellfire.

3078678,0,t1_coh29c4,Youre fun. Have you ever stopped to consider how immoral your sense of morality is? You are basically saying that morality comes from authority not from thinking. Hence if God tells you to not murder then you wont murder. If he tells you to murder then you would murder. This is obviously wrong and doesnt help advance the morality of humans. Lets answer your questions one by one. gt if you dont believe in a god that tells you these things are wrong then there is no base for morality there is no constantMorality is not constant to begin with. Different cultures in different times around the world have had a different sense of morality. Morality is differentiation of actions based on them being good or bad. This is subjective and based on the scenario at hand. There is not one statement that can tell you when something is good or bad but the golden rule be nice and dont do to others what you wouldnt want done to you comes very close. How do we know killing is wrong? As a modern society we have come together and realized that in order to prosper as a society we need certain rules of law to keep order. For example we cant kill steal or rape since that would break down society and not let us continue in a civilized manner. Clearly from the objective of keeping society civil we cannot do those things. Sometimes humans are wrong. We are humans and can make mistakes of course. The Nazis were clearly wrong and it doesnt take a genius to figure that out. Dropping a nuclear bomb was clearly wrong as well. Its not black and white and you need to analyze each situation individually. gt are people who fuck animals wrongwhy?Animals cant give informed consent so fucking an animal means raping them. Clearly this is wrong. Had you thought about this question for one second you would have realized that. gt is killing animals for meat wrong why?See now this is a tough one. This is one that isnt black or white. I think killing animals to eat them is wrong but I cant do anything about it. At this point in time humans require domesticated animals in order to survive as a species. So we dont have a choice really. Though in the future there will probably be a time when we will no longer need to kill other animals anymore because we will be able to make synthetic meat nutrient pills or whatever the future holds that has escaped my imagination. My main point is that you need to think about things to come up with whether they are moral or not. Morality that is based on our own reasoning is superior to the morality one can obtain from any authority. ,exmuslim,coh3pcr,1,t5_2s7k2

3080776,0,t1_cohamn4,It does contradict Islam in some very i think important places which make a significant difference to the quality of life for people.Also when you look at it Islamic society wouldnt suffer by removing those arbitrary prohibitions for women for gays even about eating pork. So the net good of society is NOT served by prescriptive rules that become redundant as the social structures evolve. e.g. Technology makes it possible for women to partake equally in the work force and society with men.Clearly then these rules are not for all time.Further the basis on advancing these philosophies didnt come out of the Quran  but out of the diligent secular hard work of human thinking and discussion.I think the entire concept of Halal amp Haram is fatally flawed. Since Ive stayed up all night responding  and youve seen some of my thought processes  I ask you why do you think that I think they are fatally flawed My degree is in Mathematics amp Computer Science Im interested in cognition and how the human mind evolved and formed and how computer systems at their most basic solve the same problems that life has needed to.Ive actually spent last  years doing startup companies in Silicon Valley Shanghai amp Sydney. I just happen to read a lot of history and philosophy books amongst many others. I wish id advanced my Mathematics so I could better understand some of the advanced formulations of quantum loop theory alas life is too short !!I hope to see the hard cognition problem solved in my life time These are all reasons for living.If I was forced to formalise it .... I know there was a time that I did not exist and could not experience it except through stories and as luck would have it I live in an age where I can see the past in movies.. Im alive now and experiencing the world. At some point I will be dead and no longer able to experience the world.. It then follows that I wish to extend my experiencing of the world for as long as I can for inevitably it will come to an end.. But that doesnt always hold. Imagine that im a cancer victim in excruciating pain  then the burden of experience may be worse than oblivion.. Though I hate the thought of death it should no more scare me than the time before i was born.Its within that experiencing of life VS non experiencing that one finds greater value. The nature of the experience is really up to that individual  BECAUSE  its up to that individual to determine what they value in life. Philosophical value is yet another huge discussion  But let me again quote Socrates ...The unexamined life is not worth living OR as ive adapted it to The unexamined relgion is not worth believingThat may seem harsh but it just means look at your life and see what you value within it and of what values and things of value you would wish to pursue.,exmuslim,cohbjp7,1,t5_2s7k2

With or without Islam theres still strong traditional forces holding girls back. Islam certainly isnt helping but even when the person is nonMuslim the parents still have these strong gender roles treat girls with more suspicion and control than boys.These people may be moderate in their secularism or even religion but its clear that they are still sexist. I wish they werent and I will challenge them given the right opportunity. They might remain silent about domestic violence and child abuse but I know thats different than actually doing those things. Im not going to tar them all as cancerous sexistsdishonest people who dont deserve to have children or spouses. I mean I might feel that way but its toxic to indulge those reactionary feelings.

3217518,0,t1_covh9ce,Hmmm. You sound like you might be in your s. That is kind of a tough time to be online dating. The girls online in their s are under a lot of pressure from guys in their s and the guys in their s are more wealthy confident and experienced. I would not discard online dating entirely however. Especially if you have not tried eHarmony in particular. That site specifically matches people up in a way which prevents girls just using it as a way to get lots of attention they mostly intend to ignore. Try that site specifically before giving up and set your age and geographic targets to wider than you would if you were just looking for a wife...make them wide  enough so you have lots of women to talk to older women women far away etc. Then make some female friends and talk to them intimately and sincerely as close friends even if you do not end up dating them. Your claim that attempting to get compliments is in their nature is not just true of women. It is true of all people. Coming from a traditional family you have not had the opportunity to spend time with female Canadian friends. This is your biggest problem right now. You still see women as very different from yourself. This is not how Canadian girls think. They might dress a little differently than men but they see themselves as equal with men and not very different from men in many fundamental ways. This is the biggest cultural transition that you are going to have to make. You are going to get nowhere with Canadian girls until you get very good at being their friend. You are never going to get good at being a girls friend until you become really close friends with a whole bunch of girls and grind away the cultural barriers which prevent women and men from hanging out as friends in your parents culture.  Until you do this you are well and truly fucked in the dating scene. Canadian girls will smell your lack of familiarity and distrust a mile away. Take this course preferably with some female online friends and talk with them extensively about what they the women think about love sex gender equality men doing housework and especially feminism in general. Alternately take a similar course at university and have lots of indepth conversations with your female classmates.Finding the right girl in your situation right now is a far lower priority than rethinking your ideas about women female friendship and the way men and women should ideally relate. Fortunately for you the process of doing this sincerely will undoubtedly result in lots of relationships with women and more than one of them will fall in love with you. When I was your age I facilitated the mens discussion group for a University Womens studies class. I got laid constantly and met lots of women who would have married me. If you look around on line and otherwise for women to sincerely discuss feminist issues with you and you keep an open mind and use the opportunity to really rethink your own assumptions you will do for your love life what dumping Islam has done for your intellectual life. But you will enhance your intellectual life as well and become a far wiser man.,exmuslim,covhx1n,1,t5_2s7k2

3248856,0,t1_cowjdvn,Well boys Now I am actually worried about you. The bar scene is not the answer.I have some news that is not really bad but it does require a lot of action of your part and a significant change in expectations to avoid some very unpleasant long term failure. As it stands you both are going to have a bad time with the bar scene. Worse you are both at risk for blaming white women for your impending failures. You guys have got to understand that growing up in an environment where ...all nonMuslim girls are sluts... has fucked with your heads and left you with a perspective and a number of assumptions about women which can  and will  ruin your life in the Western dating world if you do not take this problem seriously.The fact that you have already summed up young women on line as either fat girls or whores confirms this. Of course white girls dont really care about you you are both walking talking sexist dickheads. Just to let you know how much Western women will hate your current attitudes toward women  years ago women literally would have referred to your type as a  male chauvinist pig. Fortunately for you there is a cure. But your future dating and romantic success hinges solely on your willingness to realize that you are carrying around way more sexist baggage from your upbringing  and porn than you realize. For another shocker the fact is that fat girls are your only way out of this initially. On line or elsewhere you must stop limiting your interaction with white women to models who meet your physical expectations. You not only need to realize that ugly girls and whores are people just like you but also that all women especially fat girls and whores are the potential friends that you disparately fucking need right now. I have no idea how physically attractive either of you are but even if you guys are over foot benching twice your body weight with less than  body fat and both with faces cuter than fuck you are still both heading for a series of lifethreatening disappointments with women that will either drive you to suicide or turn you into bitter lonely assholes. Incidentally if you really do want a super hot chick that bad and they can be a liability let me tell you from experience you had better be in the gym on a superheavy weight training program and eating right from tomorrow if you are not doing this now you are probably not as good looking as you think you are.For both of you guys seriously dating white women to find a wife is suicidaly premature. Before you do that you have to neutralize your fuckedup family values and assumptions by exposing yourselves to Western feminism Feminism is going to drag you both through a critical look at both your own and societys fucked up standards for physical attractiveness age and weight for women and help you more than anything else to overcome the fuckedup cocktail of attitudes you have absorbed from the combination of watching porn and the medieval world view of your parents. You guys need to find some girls that are appropriate for you right now. Obviously by that I do not mean girls to marry. Like a kid learning to ride a bike you need women with training wheels for a while. You need to learn to be nice respectful kind and supportive friends to women who are almost certainly relatively fat ugly whores or old by your current utterly fucked and unrealistic standards. Thats right chaps you need to learn to love fat ugly whores as cherished friends before you will have the remotest fucking change with pretty white chicks. If you are hot enough yourself the fat ugly whores will one day introduce you to your attractive life partner wife. The world has a way of balancing shit out in this regard. But your current attitudes are a liability far worse than being fat. Befriending loving and maybe if you are nice and do what I tell you even fucking a herd of fat ugly whores is what you two guys need more than all the hot chicks on planet Earth.The social process of learning to be real  friends with less than perfect women is inextricable from fixing your philosophical problems with sexism. If I was you I would go directly to rfeminism and ask for help. Tell them you are the young men equivalent of grandmas laptop badly infected riddled with sexist viruses and malware and that you are badly in need of some feminist mentoring to help you identify and quarantine all of that bad thinking and become better people. We have fullon Canadian guys in Canada who think they are better than women that women should do all the housework etc....and we call them divorced lonely redneck idiots. Do not puss out on me here boys. Manup and talk to the feminists...they do not bite. If you chicken out of this you are pussies and deserve what you get. Try to make friends with people at rfeminism and talk to them about making friends with real women who do not look like porn stars. Talk to the real women you make friends with elsewhere about the things your rfeminism mentors have got you thinking about. In this context lovingly and respectfully fuck  or so lessthanperfect chicks remember the fat ugly. whores you were on about...you better hope they are whores or you two morons will be virgins till you buy a wife from Bangladesh. After you fuck them remain kind honest and close friends with them so they will talk to their hot friends about what a sweet honest progressive READ AS Western understanding guy you are then call me in the morning.I realize I have told you this before. But your later comments have confirmed that things are worse than I first thought. You guys are doomed to a life of real shit unless you . take a crash course in feminism . learn to see women as human beings like yourselves and . take a whole lot of time to catch up on the process of being friends with the girl next door that you missed out on because of your parents . Fuck an army of the girls appropriate for you to be fucking now. Chop chop. Accept that you are virgin idiots and gratefully fuck anything willing to enter into a trusting respectful honest relationship with you. If you hook up on line nobody ever has to know. There is an ocean of female imperfection out there commensurate with your own appalling sexual and social inexperience and backward ideas about women. Your competitors have been fucking imperfect girls since they were  and they still fuck them for old times sake. Lower your standards. Dive in and swim for your fucking lives...and your children and grandchildrens lives. Good luck. Im rootin for ya and Im here to help.

3261129,0,t1_cozzo82,Hey Arisax Ive just been thinking a lot lately. Ive been thinking for my fellow sufferers those who have it MUCH worse than I. Ive been thinking for myself. Will any of us every be able to live happy lives? I mean you can be happy to an extent. I am. Then I remember that there are thousands if not millions of people being persecuted for their choice of faith or lack thereof. Its just not fair. Moving away from my own petty problems such as not being able to not have a night out with my friends to those who literally have to fear for their lives every day stuck in a society that refuses to acknowledge them as people with feelings emotions... pain. Yet we in this amazing day and age still have families who are willing to physically abuse mentally torture or threaten to remove you based on what should be free will. Maybe because Ive grown up in the west that I cannot begin to fathom this attitude due to my humanistic nature. The issues of Islam are poignant in the lives of people like myself. Oh how Id love to be free. But the deafening silence of the lack of common ground on anything to talk about in my household is strong with my father at least. There is  communication because underneath he knows that Im not religious yet he most likely believes that I do not actually refuse Islam. Part of me doesnt want to disappoint and send him into depression part of me fears his reaction physical or mental and part of me worries about my own mental health.I think one of the big things to talk about when referring to lives such as mine in the west is the immense loneliness that can overcome you as you get older. Most of my friends are nonmuslim and it is hard to balance a life of excuses of why you cannot go there or do that out of fear. Not to mention that sexual frustration that comes along with growing up in Islam which I think is an aspect not nearly talked about enough. I realise that this subreddit is for discussing Islam or recovering exmoose and that my vent might be a little bit off but I probably speak for many when I say my piece. Yet it doesnt go away.

If they specifically targeted civilians they wouldnt be dropping leaflets for people to get out of the city. what theyre targeting is industrial infrastructure that supports the war effort.

Ive been drinking amp occasionally smoking for three or so years and I havent been caught. Depending on how much they trust you your parents probably dont think youre out getting high or drunk as much as you think they are. Just some tips Dont get completely wasted.  Only go home when your near sober or if everyone else is asleep.  Find a damn good place to hide your weed or drinks or if you live in a nonMuslim country keep it with a friend who lives alone or whos parents dont care Make sure you smell good when you get home.  Unless they catch you with your hand in the cookie jar always deny everything. Careful with your lighters and other paraphernalia keep everything accounted for. If you smoke at home or go out for walks to smoke which is riskier make sure you have a purpose for leaving the house thats not just Im going for a walk. Good luck ,exmuslim,cphcl3b,3,t5_2s7k2

Have you heard about the recent succession controversy in the dawoodi bohra community? Heres the wikigtThe  death of Mohammed Burhanuddin who was the nd D alMutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra  a sect within Shia Islam sparked a succession crisis where two rival claimants emerged for the title of rd D alMutlaq his son Mufaddal Saifuddin and his halfbrother Khuzaima Qutbuddin who was previously mazoon Associate next to the D of the Dawoodi Bohra. After Burhanuddin suffered a stroke in June  in London a ceremony was conducted to declare Mufaddal Saifuddin as his successor while the Syedna suffered cerebral stroke and was not in position to speak nor move on his own. The Dawoodi Bohra community was reported about the succession by Mufaddals brothers a group formed in  in support of Burhanuddins halfbrother Khuzaima Qutbuddin who was Mazoon serving second under Dai al Mutlaq. Khuzaima has denied formation of any separate sect by publishing a public affidavit.After the Syednas death in January  Mufaddal took up the office claiming to have been appointed successor after the D alMutlaq had suffered a stroke in . Khuzaima Qutubuddin also took office as the rd D of Dawoodi Bohras with two headquarters the primary being in Darus Sakina in Thane and the other in Saifee Mahal where Mufaddal resides. Qutbuddin claiming to have been appointed heir  years earlier in secrecy challenged Mufaddals right to be Dai in court.The faction belonging to Mufaddal Saifuddin supports Mufaddal Saifuddin as the Dbetter source needed whose faction have excommunicated Qutbuddin and his followers. However there is no official confirmation from Dawoodi Bohra community on the alleged excommunication and the progressive members have called a ban on this practice citing it as illegal.,exmuslim,cq9c25t,2,t5_2s7k2

3726963,0,t3_33212d,Im a Christian and I live in a Muslim country. I dont think its particularly effective or valid to compare the two sets of believers in this way. Its too simple if anything. Christian intolerance and violence manifests differently nowadays. Firstly the western media will be quick to point out that a perpetrator is a Muslim but how often do you even hear about attacks against Muslims in mainstream media and there are many? Let alone whether the attacker Christian. Secondly Christianity has had more time to mellow and mature so to speak. Vitriol which uses Christianity as its basis is now verbal rather than physical. Think of the hate speech and picketing by the Westboro Baptist Twats or American politicians who spew rubbish about abstinence and abortion. Thirdly Islam is in the very interesting position of being in an age of communication which other mainstream movements didnt have. Some vague examples The crusaders womens rights and racial movements didnt have such access to social networking and the arms trade during the height of their  movements and rallies. Who knows how different their outcomes could have been if they has access to the same methods that some Islamic groups have.Im not arguing that the Quran etc. doesnt have some truly awful violent justifications that I wholeheartedly disagree with. Rather that comparison to another religion in this way isnt the most effective argument.Anyway I think this is a really interesting topic and Im interested in other peoples opinions about what I wrote. ,exmuslim,cqh3kix,2,t5_2s7k2

3958772,0,t1_cr7gkvi,In my country most Muslims are Sufis. I think the problem with radicalization started when young Russians mostly Caucasian people started traveling abroad to study Islam. This happened because authorities were beginning to crack down on fundamentalist Islam after the Chechen war in the early s. These students probably attended madrassas that taught Wahhabism. When they returned back home they radicalized their friends. I dont know what percentage of Muslims in Russia are fundamentalists but theres enough of them that they have caused real fear in this country. Five years ago ordinary Russians in Moscow were afraid of being blown up on subways. I was one of those ordinary Russians. Although the authorities officially banned Wahhabism the fundamentalists just call themselves Salafi now which is legal. The reason the Salafis are so popular with young Muslims is that the Sufis the Russian Council of Muftis are allied with the government. The Salafis also hate our foreign policy. So the fundamentalists started declaring Sufis apostates and began killing them. Still were lucky most people around here call themselves murids not jihadists. Sufism has longer and richer tradition in this country. ,exmuslim,cr7j7zo,3,t5_2s7k2

Dat is meteen het verschil met sommige moslims die je meteen willen afknallen als je met wat humor hun religie en profeet op de hak neemt. Apart diezelfde zorgen heb ik niet met andere religies ...   gt gelukkig denken niet veel Nederlanders zo over haar. Dat is een claim en dan moet je met bewijs komen. Dat zijn de spelregels. gt Keek even naar je post geschiedenis en wow er is iemand even over obsessed met de IslamNou niet zoveel als de mensen die  keer per dag op de knietjes gaan elke week de moskee in duiken en dadelijk een hele maand voor de Ramadan de dag door niet gaan eten vanwege hun imaginaire vriendje in de lucht. Niet zoveel als de duizenden Europese moslims die een psychopaten club als ISIS meehelpen om hele gebieden te zuiveren. Niet zoveel als al die moslims die in polls hun als helden zien ipv de zieke geesten die het zijn. Als jullie die troep niet hadden meegenomen naar dit land dan had me het heel veel tijd gescheeld om links islam knuffelend Nederland uit te leggen dat ze flirten met een gevaarlijke totalitaire ideologie die vrijheid en gelijkheid mijn waarden overal weet te verdringen waar het voet aan de grond krijgt. Lees dit maar om te begrijpen waar ik vandaan kom  Freedomhouse map   Morocco does not impose the death penalty against apostates under the provisions of its Penal Code.  However in April  the Supreme Council of Religious Scholars issued a religious decree fatwa that Moroccan Muslims who leave Islam must be sentenced to death. Religious decrees are significant because Islam is the official state religion under article  of the Moroccan Constitution of . Additionally under article  of the Constitution the Supreme Council of Religious Scholars is the sole instance enabled habilite to comment prononcer on religious consultations Fatwas.Ik ben niet eens tegen de islam sec. Ik ben voor vrijheid gelijkheid en tolerantie. Maar deze waarden en de bescherming ervan dwingen mij om voor hun natuurlijke vijand te waarschuwen de supremacistische kuffaar hatende islam  The Muslim should feel in his heart that he hates the kuffaar and the way they look and behave. This hatred will motivate him to avoid looking like them at all in the way he dresses or in other ways. Do you not see that a person who despises a people or tribe or people from a certain country will hate to dress like them especially if they are poor. As Shaykh alIslam Ibn Taymiyah said Looking like them in external appearance indicates that one loves them in ones heart and vice versa. And Allaah knows best.Islam QampA Sheikh Muhammed Salih AlMunajjidWeet je wat obsessief is? Een religie die constant af zit te geven en te haten op mensen die geen vlieg kwaad doen. De hele tijd maar diegenen zwart maken die niet in hetzelfde debiele boekje geloven. Vers na vers over anderen hebben die niet geloven en ze dan ook nog eens beloofd voor altijd te gaan martelen in het hiernamaals. Dat is obsessief en bovendien compleet gestoord op de koop toe. Om in het hier en nu nog niet te spreken over homos lesbos afvalligen die het naar het leven staat. Ik wil best met je gaan bespreken in welke moslimlanden deze mensen buitengesloten en zelfs gecriminaliseerd worden. Misschien kun je begrijpen dat ik met mijn Nederlandse achtergrond en het feit dat ze hier allang volledig geaccepteerd en verrijking van onze maatschappij zijn het onacceptabel vind dat we een ideologie aan het importeren zijn die alles op het spel kan gaan zetten op termijn.

And do you think those atheist parents are going to give their kids a fair chance at picking different religions? Will you tell your kids that you honestly dont know if a god exists or not and that it is up to them to choose a religion? Many people say they would do this but so far I havent met any atheists with the widespread contact between major religious faiths that I have had due to my Hindu upbringing. A lack of fanaticism and strict adherence to a hard rule set meant I was more likely to listen to other religious groups and formulate my own ideas. Are you seriously telling me your children will learn the nuances of Sikh culture and religion in the name of balance? Give over mate you know as well as I do that to most atheists the idea of religion is Christianity and Judaism followed by Islam and we rarely speak or see any atheist from any other faith and if we do they are sidelined. Hell? Do you know what happened the last time I spoke about being a Hindu? A discussion about Sati and How Indians treat Women. Never mind the fact that bans on Sati predate British Arrival and that the biggest driving force in India at the time was a bunch of Hindus. Or the fact that Sati was anathema to most South Indians who considered it really stupid. Thats the level of knowledge we as atheists have about religion. We are often ignorant. We have bashed it for so long we know precious little about actual religion bar the one we were brought up in.

4303808,0,t3_39x430,Hoooo boy.Such a loaded question. I could write a book!Instead of that allow me to offer you the example of a late professor of mine who was a devout christian who believed in Jesus as the son of God.She lived breathed and loved God with all of her heart. Love permeated with every interaction and she was in such peace that I would stop stare and wish that I believed in god myself.One thing that never seems to be discussed often is that Atheism is kind of lonely. Its just you. Theres no supreme loving being thats going to always watch over you and take care of you and shower you with love. And when something happens in life that you cant explain or reconcile instead of falling back on God you just have to bitterly accept the unknown.She got cancer two years ago. She died very recently. I believe that her faith was what kept her alive for as long as she was. She was a light to her family her congregation and to her students me included.She is going to hell according to Islam. My parents who loved her as well said shes a person of the book so she neither need fear nor grieve. I was quick to point out however that her belief in Jesus as the son of god and other christian beliefs that directly conflicted with Islams teachings disqualified her as a person of the book. They had to acknowledge that she would be going to hell but itd be a very light punishment ahem who are they to judge?. Given that the lightest punishment is still pretty damn badalBukhaari reports from alNumaan ibn Basheer who saidI heard the Messenger of Allaah Sallallaahu Alaihi WaSalaam say The person who will have the least punishment among the people of Hell on the Day of Resurrection will be a man under the arch of whose feet will be placed a smouldering ember and his brains will boil because of it.So according to Islam this beautiful person who touched my life the lives of my parents and the lives of many others will still have to undergo this type of torture in hell just because she isnt muslim and doesnt qualify as a person of the book. Where is the justice in that?I ask my parents no more to stay safe. I dont need to really. They avoid thinking about her even now because they cant reconcile it.,exmuslim,csarinv,2,t5_2s7k2

4325889,0,t1_csd87q6,gt Look up Quran abrogation some scholars think verse  was abrogated with the sword verse. Oh nice you just hit at one of my favorite subjects. Lets begin by Looking at the most authoritative amp authentic reference on exegesis namely Tafsir AlTabari Jamii AlBayan An Taweel Ayaa AlQuran. When he explains  he first mentions a lot of narrations from the companions and tabeen and then he mentions that some say that  was abrogated by the sword verse and then he saysgt                            .               So a verse cannot abrogate another until it completely negates the other one this isnt the case with  vs  concludes AlTabari.Shaykh Jamal AlDin Zarabozo words it in a similar mannergt  AlDausiri rejects this statement because of the following A verse cannot abrogate another verse unless it completely removes the ruling of the earlier verse and there is no way to reconcile the contradictory meanings of the verses. I may refer you to Yusuf AlQaradawis book The Verse of The Sword which refutes the claim that this verse of the sword abrogated all previous verses of peace and tolerance. Theres also a master treatise by     titled             which analyses the claim that this sword verse abrogated all the previous verses of tolerance.gtWe as socalled native Muslims had no choice of our religion before we left it and are not willing to fight or harm Muslims how is that we should be killed just for disagreeing with some Islamic teachings ? were is verse  where is verse  ?Here they aregtAccording to all the theories of language elaborated by Muslim legal scholars the Quranic proclamation that There is no compulsion in religion.The right path has been distinguished from error is as absolute and universal a statement as one finds. The truth had been made clear and nowWhoever wants let him believe and whoever wants let him disbelievethe holy book continues   Why then do all four Sunni schools of law agree that a Muslim manwho leaves Islam is killed if he refuses to recant the Hanafis only punish awoman with imprisonment? gt  ... Both scholars Ali Gomaa and Yusuf AlQaradawi arrived at the same conclusions regarding apostasyand both took the legal custom of Muslims as more determinative ofthe Prophets teachings than Hadiths themselves. Gomaa and Qaradawiaffirmed that at the level of personal conscience and private religion thefreedom of belief was absolute. The Quran had clearly mandated this.... The two scholars bypassedthe Hadiths by subordinating them to the actual casebycase rulings ofMuhammad and the early caliphs on apostates. Gomaa provides a lengthylist of instances in which the Prophet overlooked blatant unbelief amongthe Medinan Hypocrites and even pardoned such career reprobates as IbnAbi Sarh a Meccan who had converted to Islam and joined Muhammadas one of his scribes in Medina only to cast off the new faith and seek fortune anew back in Mecca as a satirist insulting the Prophet in poetry.Both Gomaa and Qaradawi cite the ruling made by Umar who as caliphstated his preference for offering apostates another chance to believebefore imprisoning them if they refused. The legal custom of the Prophetand early caliphs therefore prove that the Hadiths ordering execution forapostasy cannot be taken as definitive. It must be understood within somespecified context.Gomaa compares the apostasy condemned by the Hadiths as closer tohigh treason namely a betrayal of the Muslim state and polity. Qaradawidistinguishes this severe form of apostasy which he labels Apostasy ofTransgression from the lesser apostasy of an individual making the personal choice to privately change his or her religious beliefs. This lesser formwas not punishable under the Shariah. Transgressive apostasy such aspublic ridicule of Islam or calling others to apostatize however amountedto an attack on the religious structures of society and was indeed punishableby death. Furthermore Qaradawi interprets Umars lenient statement onapostasy as evidence that the gruff second caliph understood the Prophetssevere condemnations of leaving Islam as a ceiling of punishment and nota strict rule.

Would any Protestant accept that they arent representing Christianity? Similarly Mormons think theyre Christians and some denominations think they arent. Same with Jehovahs witnesses Baptists Calvinists etc. Some groups think theyre the only true Christians and everyone else isnt. Its called the No True Scotsman Fallacy look it up.So are ISIS Muslims? They use the Quran and prophetic tradition of Islam to justify their actions and will point to verses that show theyre right. Theyll say theyre following the true Islam. Other Muslims will use the Quran and prophetic tradition to justify their viewpoints and point to verses that show ISIS is wrong. Theyll claim that in fact they are the true Muslims and ISIS are not.So who are the true Muslims? All of them and none of them. Like with Christianity. There is no one true interpretation.

4554092,0,t3_3dcy0c,There is this entity who made you just so that you could worship said entity. That entity created trillions upon trillions of planets and star and galaxies but is only interested in  of x of its creation and virtually knows nothing about the rest of the universe. This entity cares about what you eat who you sleep with if you masturbate or what you consume as food and the direction in which you worship it. This entity also let . of all the species it created go extinct and purposefully created disease bacterias viruses and fungal infections to decimate its most intelligent species. That entity apparently also answers prayers but is unable to communicate directly with its own creations and must use intermediaries and pick remote uneducated and illiterate people in the worst times in its creations history to spread its knowledge and wisdom. Knowing the future this entity knows very well that the st century would be a perfect time to show itself but instead prefers to wait for . years of its creation living in misery disease and child death and show itself in the bronze age to uneducated and illitereate middle eastern desert sheep herders...instead of waiting for the st century and speak with the Nobel prize commission to name a few.Nevermind the fact that this entity could have spoken during antiquity to the egyptians or the Chinese civilizations which already had print and were much advanced than a desert sheep herders of the middle east during the th century. Even the Romans would have been a better choice than someone with epilepsy who took  years to learn what he was told.This entity also conveniently borrowed almost all its material from previous manmade religions including the names of the main figures and the numerous myths without knowing anything about physics and science. This entity also was confused about the earth not being flat and forgot that man lived to be  years old and could fly to a mythical place on a winged horse that this entity never created. That entity also forgot that its creation apparently could cut celestial bodies in half with a man made sword.Finally this entity decided to make all its worshipers OCD by forcing them to partake in a ritual  times a day and forcing them to face a certain direction but that entity forgot to remember that the universe is vast and that when its creations will move to the other side of the galaxy it will be impossible to find said direction...or that when the local star will explode due to losing its fuel the earth will be destroyed removing the direction where his worshipers are supposed to face.Come to think of it this entity sounds a lot like a th century uneducated person,exmuslim,ct4nxnl,1,t5_2s7k2

He always carried these two kiwis so he could demonstrate to the people the genius of why Allah ordered us to shave our nether regions. Whenever someone would ask the man Why would Allah give us hair down there if he wants us to shave it off anyway? the man would share his wisdom. The man would pull out the kiwis from his sweaty pockets and ask the person Would you rather suck on the kiwi with or without the hairy skin? Subhanallah it was a perfect way to get the truth to a womens inferior mind through her personal experiences.

You are mistaking the  American politicians barking in behalf of defense industry that always needs an enemy to have US and stupid Eastern Europeans to buy  toys  from them. America isnt some sort of God that westernised people followI think it is you who is obsessing too much with USA America. I suggest you and those who thin along this line need to evaluate their own psyches.  I believe most Western media and western culture is trash especially AmericanWhat constitute a culture for you?  I get the feeling that You have decided what is American culture based on TV shows or movies or things you have seen in media.American value hard work generally are not too hung up on their clothingdress.  Generally much more friendlier than say Europeans.  There is lot of trash but it is visible and not  hidden so easy to pick on. There is nothing worse than eastern culture of hiding their worse excesses and pretend that they dont exist. Compare for example the way extra marital affairs in US and in Japan.   In US it is acknowledged  as part of life and dealt with. Whereas in Japan it  is known to be wide spread but  it is rarely discussed or acknowledged.  Another claim that is often made is that American are materialistic. What  that American dont look down on it. By contrast I met Asians and Middle eastern who would accuse the Americans of being materialistic and yet were obsessed with getting the latest or that gadget record player car sun glasses. Americans simply havent mastered the art of hypocrisy of the old world.  guys just have the worst music and the worst food and the worst trends and the worst media.

At this stage Im in my thirties and sitting on the fence. That asshole Hamza Tzortzis did more to make me leave Islam than anyone else a few years ago when I started watching Islam vs. Atheism debates. His sly sneaky and bullshit arguments made me question everything even things that I was comfortable in just accepting without looking deeper into it. I was also a huge fan of Ahmed Deedat and loved listening to the guy.. until I found out how he died which shook me to my very core. For those who dont know who he is Ahmed Deedat appeared in many debates but some of the more interesting ones related to Muhammad being foretold in the Bible. Thats all well and good but he had a massive stroke soon after ripping into the story of the crucifixion and died painfully years after that. I still feel like crying while typing this because this single event started my journey into the deeper parts of Islam and placed doubts in my head.Life is a journey and no avenue should be closed off to you even if it is a former religion.

The ego will not be rewarded for anything it did in this life. As it dies with the body. And its only the ego which worries about death rewards etc. Maybe some other parts of the human being will survive who knows... but the ego will die for sure. Many people with spiritual experiences got a glimpse at what ego deathego loss feels like its not that bad really. Sufis call this fana which is most likely considered shirk by most Muslims as it proclaims fundamental unity between individual creation and creator. Many feel that they are one with the universe or with god after their ego dies. And this is what I believe may happen. As a pantheist not as a Sufi. The notego part of our existence may become reunited with the source. Anyway you should believe in life before death rather than in life after death. And dont fear what comes after it.

One classmate went on an antifascist march as there were some antimuslim nationalists marching nearby  I figured fair enough with that as they seem a shitty shouty bunch.Thing is he was happy to admit that the people he was marching with were around  lefties and around  fundamentalists who were antidemocracy.  He did not see marching with these people as a problem so long as it was recognised they had a common enemy.  My suggestion that it was not progressive to march against apparent bigots but march with backwards fundamentalists who oppose democracy instead was met with confusion.I have a friend who remains a Muslim who is part of a group in the states promoting democracy in the MiddleEast.

5396153,0,t3_3oxssw,Interesting. Im a US ex muslim. Did you know that during the Zanj slave rebellion in BasraIraq  black slaves rebelled against their muslim owners? Most were killed. This was just one muslim city. There were millions of black slaves back then. Compare this number to the number of the African slaves brought to the US additional source here and you will see that the number of slaves alone in Basra is equal to the number of all slaves brought to the US i.e. . Of the total transatlantic slavetrade only . went to the US the rest over  Islamic slavery was waaay bigger than Western slavery. In addition to that most slaves brought to the US were bought from muslim slave traders Around  million Africans were enslaved and at least  of those captured by Muslim slave traders died before they even reached the slave markets. The death toll from the  centuries of Muslim slave raids into Africa has been estimated to be over  million source sourceFurthermore most slaves were castrated and over  didnt survive that procedure. Muslims buried them alive in the hot desert sand with just their heads sticking out in order to immobilize them so that the wound wouldnt break open. The high price brought by few surviving eunuchs on the market made the practice profitable. Some muslim scholars differentiated between the two types of castration If the testicles were only cut off then the slave is a eunuch if only his penis is cut off then he is emasculated. They castrated them because they didnt want their offspring to contaminate Arab societies which were seen as superior. This is the reason Iraq isnt black today because they were all castrated. Same for Saudi Arabia where you could buy black slaves all the way to the mid ies. Many purchased them during haj and brought them home as a souvenir heres a video Saudi Sheikh Saleh AlFawzan a member of the Senior Council of Clerics had said in  those who argue that slavery is abolished are ignorant not scholars. They are merely writers. Whoever says such things is an infidel source Slavery being legal in islam was also confirmed by Al Azhar University. In Basra for example the black slaves outnumbered Arabs yet Basra is not black today because they had no offspring. Unlike in the US which didnt castrate their slaves and now has a large black population. Slavery in the US was bad but slavery in the muslim world was way worse than that. So much for  Americas idea of slavery. Moreover muslim slave traders also traded European and Indian Hindus slaves. You are probably also aware of the fact that abd in arabic means black as well as slave.Also Mohammed was a slave trader himself. Considering that islamic scripture says that muslims need to follow his example to be good muslims theres no way slavery is not closely associated with islam even if one ignores the hadiths.gthow detrimental it is for Blacks to worship a White Jesus.Thats pure BS because a theres plenty of black Christians as a matter of fact they are the fastest growing christian group b Jesus wasnt racist so he doesnt care what your color is and c this antiblack racism has got nothing to do with christian teachings in contrast to islamic teachings but rather with a general dislike of white people by some not all black people which has historical and not religious roots. So if black muslims dont want to be christians just because Jesus was white then who is the racist here?. And BTW Jesus was from todays Israel so the color of his skin was most likely the same as mohammeds who came not far from there brown. However Mohammeds skin color was actually described as WHITE So perhaps you should inform the black muslims who hate white people about that fact and watch their heads pop.Anyway you dont need to believe in a specific god in order to have a good happy and fulfilled life and be a good person. Esp. not an islamic god who says you are inferior just because you are a woman and that you can be beaten and abused just because you are a woman.  Its just so disgusting and you deserve better than that.

I dont expect Muslim apologists with a vested interest in Islam and presupposition as the perfect ideology thats flaw free to perceive the reality of their ideology.

I think they wanted reasonable people who are on a lot and have at least a year of history.  It was an honor  like being invited to the cool kids table at lunch. I think its something most people do for  years and then step down.  I joined a good group and its been mostly painless so far.  I have heard that one mod was harassed IRL by believers but for the most part its a chill sub and Mormon culture is more passive aggressive than confrontational. I guess a lot of us like having an online community to replace the one we gave up and to share those feelings people who were never religious dont understand. There are a couple of online support groups and I think people pick by the tone that suits them.  The more strident angry one attracts angrier people  theres a couple more positive than ours that draw people trying to stay in.  I am betting that there must be a lot of small online exMuslim or doubting Muslim groups.

Taste things. Travel if you can. Read. Reddit comics philosophy whatever. In different times of your life people strangers even will throw you a lifeline. This lifeline can come in different forms as a mentor a love a book whatever.. but try to take it and better yourself. Also failure is always an option. You can learn a lot from failure. You will be stronger for it. Dont be afraid to fail. Be selfish! Learn to say NO. Fucking practice saying NO. Say it out loud when you are alone. Make it a mantra. Saying NO is not a fucking crime. Everyone should say it more often. Stop feeling guilty. Loneliness is hard I know. We all can sympathize as human beings. OP you know everyone goes through it. Everyone feels it. Loneliness is part of life. I hope you are able overcome it. Maybe that is not the right word but you know what I mean. Hate and blame is easy. It comes natural to us. But try to forgive yourself and others nobody is perfect. Forgiveness and letting go is good for YOUR mental health. Im definitely not forgiving people who fucked me over so they can feel better bout themselves. Hell no! Forgiveness helps me to move on. It dissolves whatever power they had over me. Dont cling onto hate and victimhood it will eat you up inside. Its fucking poison. Let go.And most importantly you should have your own bank account always. Nobody has to know about it. Its nobodys business. I hope everyone can experience more of the good in life.,exmuslim,cx0pnsy,1,t5_2s7k2

Youre sort of blowing it out of proportion. Your first drink will probably just be bitter shortterm regret  it will not turn you into an alcoholic . in fact youd be on the contrary lol. Alcohol will make you ugly as long as youre under the influence. After youve woken up drank some water and take a long hot steaming bath though youll be normal again. There is really no reason to drink not to drink. Its a preference and dont let others pressure you into what you dont want to do. When it comes to alcohol or really any intoxicant  take them with the ones who lovecare for you and vice versa  not alone. Thats the only way I can see consuming intoxicants can make you happier  if you have those you care about around you that make the experience more enjoyable.

This belief could stem of his past loyalties or his dislike for egyptian dictatorship but this does not make him a jihadist.By the article other lie is that he says sunnis has not clergy. This is false. I think that he is using a very restrictive view of what a clergy is and probably this falsehood stems of his desire of saving face for this faith.

The Roman World Was Covered in Dicks    .      Romans put penises everywhere. Everywhere. On childrens jewellery on the walls    on pendants and earrings they had statues of penises they made them into wind    chimes and comedy gifts. My favourite object in the history of the world is in an    obscure case in the British Museum. Its a pendant of two anthropomorphised    penises  with faces and hands  holding a double ended saw cutting in half an eye.    I want to steal it and own it and show it to everyone I encounter forever.   .    The reason Roman babies had little tiny rings with cocks on them is that penises     were considered a good luck charm and to ward off curses. This is also why the    Romans never told a good dick joke. But imagine that ladies a world quite literally     covered in dick pics.   ,exmuslim,cyh8wic,1,t5_2s7k2

There are innumerable quranic verses which fail to correspond with reality andor make no logical sense.in the quran the earth contains physical places into which the sun sets into and rises from Quran  Quran   talking hands and feet thatll bear witness against you Quran  a mathematical error in the hereditary laws Quran . the error is that the fractions each member of the family is to get totals to more than one. thanks to the absoluteness of maths this error can never be reconciled. there was a first man and woman which contradicts the evidence of evolution the sun is folded by allah  Quran  which suggests that it is a flat disk. the sun appears as a flat disk from the perspective of a person on earth but the sun is in fact a nearperfect sphere the moon emits its own light Quran  the sky is seen as some sort of solid when allah talks about pieces of sky falling Quran  or states that the sky can be rolled up Quran  the earth is never mentioned to be a sphere yet is countless times suggested to be flat. it is described as spread out Quran  like a couch for people to lay upon Quran  like a carpet Quran  Quran  like a wide plane or expanse Quran  and smooth and level with no curvature had it not been for mountains Quran  Quran . semen originates from a spot between the backbone and ribs Quran . today we know sperm comes from the testicles and semen from the pelvic region which is not between the spine and ribs.  in fetuses the bones are formed first. then it is covered in flesh Quran  Quran . this is obviously not the case and at no stage in embryology is the fetus a skeleton. modern embryology reveals that the bones form INSIDE the flesh  weeks into pregnancy.  at one point in embryology fetuses are a mere clot of blood. Quran  Sahih Bukhari .  theres never a stage in embryonic development where humans are formed into a clot of blood. the description is likely influenced by a primitive understanding of human reproduction based on observations from an earlyterm miscarriage and a womans menstrual cycle.  the earth is stationary and does not move Quran  which is obviously not the case as it orbits around the sunagain there are many things ive left out the moon splitting mo riding off on a winged horse geocentricism nonexistent  atmospherical layers humans are made from clay etc.. immoralities of islam the concept of allah. an egotistical sadist who will torture you for ETERNITY if you do not worship him. muhammad had sex with a  year old a fact which is accepted by muslim scholars and the majority of muslims. it is recorded in plenty of hadith Sahih Bukhari  Sahih Bukhari  Sahih Bukhari  Sahih Bukhari  Sahih Muslim  Sahih Muslim  Sahih Muslim  Abu Dawud  Abu Dawud  all of which are regarded as authentic. apostates such as ourselves are to be killed according to islams founder muhammad.

6482989,0,t3_44f73n,Hey! First of all welcome to the haven of infidelity and the endless heresy! Here take your seat enjoy your Heineken and Bacon sandwich!Just saw this which Id like to addressgt  but I keep thinking  what if were wrong? We all understand as scientists the limitations of human abilities. Limitations in our perceptions and understandings of the complexities of the universe. What we got this one wrong?Atheist here. Whenever people tell me exactly this I tell them that there are two different discussions Could there be a god a deity with super high intelligence which arranges everything?  Could Islam be the truth?Now I myself see no chance of truth in either of these. First of all Islam. Logically speaking there cannot be one book of morals andlaws which can guide the world society from th century to the end of the world. Simply because as humans change due to their inventions cultural exchanges and etc. so do their morals and laws. And when you try to live with a book which was written in th century you just dont fit in the progressive society. Well this is natural. If you live exactly as Bible tells you you end up the same. Same goes for Torah. All written in ancient times and their points references all go back in time to those eras. Hence the backwardness. Hence the woman modesty comes first kind of thoughts in all of these. Therefore I dont believe that a book let that be Quran Bible Torah Vedas Avesta whatsoever can guide humans through their entire journey on earth. It is logically not possible. And I am not going to dive into ridiculous mythological concepts of angels why would a god need servants if he is almighty and all that? or other creatures. For me the point was that I cannot follow a book of th century to live my life in st one. It doesnt make sense. Secondly the god question. What if there is a god and we are all wrong? Well let us think about it. A god a deity which creates us humans. Why? Now a religious person directly inputs the answer of god works in mysterious ways we dont know everything and we are not supposed to you should quit questioning too much otherwise youll end up in heresy. However as we are people who can reason unlike them let us continue. Imagine a god who is capable of doing everything he wants. Why would there be a need for creating humans? Is he bored? No boredom is a humanly feeling. Is he having fun? No fun is humane as well. Then why? Why would he even attempt to create a so called test at all as religious books tell? Doesnt he already know the result? Yes he does. He is able to see the future anytime. Why does he play this game? Or why would he? Does he feel lonely? No loneliness is humane. A possible god should be beyond such primitive humanly feelings. He should be an absolute logic robot which does every bit with a reason. He should have no needs or weaknesses. And when you think of such a god only then that deity could be called god you just realize that there is no logical reason to create anything. You are a god and you dont need anything you dont need worshiping you dont need any judgement day. You simply wouldnt do these.This is how I think. Do not go harsh on yourself though this is a process and it takes time. Question yourself and find out the truth within your reality. Sure read the stuff in exMuslim reddit as well maybe you can see something from us which you missed. Or vice versa. ,exmuslim,czpw0yg,3,t5_2s7k2
6483643,0,t3_44g7xw,I understand their concerns. I also dont like how some of the MiddleEasterners behave in Europe or in Germany to be specific in this thread since we are talking about PEGIDA which stands for Patriots against Islamization. However their motives are sometimes a bit off the limit. I watched the documentary on VICE One can say Well this wasnt PEGIDA this is just Hooligans but we all know these people are mostly in both of the organizations. It is not like PEGIDA has none of these guys in the video more or less the same crowd exists in PEGIDA as well. In any case  I saw that there was a girl with a shirt which was Auschwitz University written on it. Now this is too far. As long as they stay away from Nazi referencing racism and etc. I am fine with them. However the question to raise here is.. Do they stay away from that really? I see a lot of skinheads hanging around in the demonstrations in the video also some kebap shops were attacked why? so I am concerned about PEGIDA using Islamization to justify antiimmigrant rhetoric. As long as they stay as AntiIslam I am fine but if they cross the limit to AntiImmigrant which means regardless of what an immigrant thinksbelieves then it is just plain racism decorated with some fancy words.,exmuslim,czpyge0,11,t5_2s7k2

The truth is the whole thing is very subjective.

Ive linked to the source below which includes hadith and Quranic sourcesgtIn the Massacre of Banu Quraiza Muhammad order the beheading of  to  adult men determined by pubichair growth and he himself chopped off a few heads. He enslaved all the women and children of the Jewish tribe. The women were kept as sexslaves with Muhammad himself taking a beautiful Jewish woman as his own sexslave and sold the rest of the captives into slavery. He also looted the property of the murdered Jews and took possession of all their wealth and properties. Allah like a godfather and mafia chieftain of the Muhammads criminal gang rejoiced this barbarous and heinous acts of slaughtering the Jews and enslavement of their women and children by creating  teachings in the Koran as the Eternal Laws of God.gtAt the Massacre of Khaybar Muhammad brutally tortured a Jewish chieftain for extracting information about where he had hidden his treasures. When the treasure was uncovered the chieftain was beheaded. This chieftain was the husband of the most beautiful Jewish woman of Khaybar the yearold Safiyaah. Safiyaahs family members had been annihilated by Muhammad at the Banu Qurayza massacre. Now having beheaded her husband the Prophet took Safiyah as his sexslave and copulated on the same night.gtIn the massacre of the Jewish Settlement of Bani Mustaliq Muhammad captured their women and took twentyyearold Jewish girl Juwayriya as his sexslave.gt,exmuslim,d0405tl,3,t5_2s7k2

Christians on the other hand have wiggle room to believe in their religion as well as evolution.  For instance the Pope recently recognized the fact of evolution and incorporated it into the Catholic doctrine so now other Catholics have to recognize it as well.  Islam has no equivalent to a Pope who can just reinterpret or nullify parts of the religion to adjust it for evolving sentiments in different ages.  gtPope says evolution Big Bang are realgtThat is I think the reason why many educated Muslims are leaving the faith they are only given a choice between ignorance and atheism and they would rather not choose to remain ignorant just to maintain the communal aspect of the religion which in my view is the only positive aspect of Islam.

Seriously though Muslims today are far more religious than there parents generation. With Arab petrodollars Islams influence is only increasing. gtBut its a paradox since like I said Islam doesnt encourage the spread of science and technology since those are things of this world it just encourages dumb rules and rituals and punishing people who violate the rules of Islam.Yeah. Many Muslims think just because were not stoning people to death anymore or amputating hands were suffering. I know folks at rIslam say that when Muslims say they want Shariah theyre mostly talking about things like compulsory zakat or enforcing a personal dress code. But Ive lived in a Muslim country and when Muslims say they want Shariah they are very much talking about reviving those brutal stone age punishments not all that personal stuff. Why? because Islam says that it offers the best legal system known to mankind. So to many Muslims jailingfiningbanning etc. will always remain inferior to floggingbeheadingamputating. Theyll always demand for the latter thinking itll eliminate all the corruption in their society and lead to prosperity. I dont even blame them because they think theyre just doing what God commands them to. gtThe only plan that Muhammad came up with for bringing more prosperity to Muslims is to invade nonMuslim territories and make them pay the jizya or slaughter them and take their lands and resources as war booty.This is probably why the Islamic empire expanded so much. Also dont forget slaves. Slave trade contributed a lot to the early Islamic empire esp. female slave trade.  Not to forget Muhammad left us with a big problem by banning interest. Now how is a modern day society going to survive wo interest? Even ISIS has a hard time getting around Islamic finance rules. They are smuggling oil and artifacts.

A crazed individual in the asylum has every faith that he is the Lord Commander of the Vaticans army but his faith isnt enough to make it true. Nor is only our faith that he isnt enough to damn him.

When liberals push for gay marriage rights Muslims go up in arms because theyre offended by two consenting adults males holding hands and getting married but will happily worship a th century warlord who married a  year old child and had sex with her when she turned .Muslims have NO morals! Theres no fucking way you can call two consenting adult males evil and dirty prevent them from loving each other and marrying kill them for being gay while rallying behind a fucking pedophile warlord Muhammad pigshitbeuponhim.My mother was forced into an arranged marriage at the age of .

Getting rid of Islam altogether would be nice but it isnt realistic at least not for several generations and if rushed would more than likely create new problems. Were witnessing the slow death of one major religion Christianity. The extinction of Christianity has absolutely nothing to do with new age atheist movements or critics like Hitchens or Dawkins its dying simply as a byproduct of reforms made during the Enlightenment the separation of church and state and other baby steps. Had atheists back then opposed any reformation of the church wed still be stuck in the dark ages with the inquisition.

Show than that theyre nowhere good enough to give it to you and I even play the card of If Im horrible then youre the reason for that cause Im a genetical copy of yourself with the person you chose to get married. In your case itll be since she called you a whore give it back saying that even if hypothetically its true that youve whorish characteristics that she thats your mother is the reason for passing on those characteristics. Fight back dont think of extremes such as leaving the family unless it gets to a point of harassment eventually theyll get the fact that you have an independent mind you can hope of people turning wiser as they age or give up. I for one have still not informed them about my atheism for me harassment isnt the issue the problem with my parents is that theyll end up blaming themselves for how I turned out and end up fighting with each other Im planning on putting off informing them for as long as possible.

Look at Ataturk what a great guy everyone loved him. But thanks to too moderate stance of current Ataturkists on Kurdish issue you have these Grey Wolves idiots voting for Erdogan but secular otherwise their emprasis in on Turkism not religion per se religion is perceived as a part of national culture Turkishness i should say. In Islamic worldWe have leftwing Islamists e.g. Hassan alBanna ideasWe have rightwing Islamists e.g. extreme SalafistsWe have leftwing secularists e.g. panArabists or current AtaturkistsBut we lack rightwing secular secularists a problem we should address. You know websites like Atheist Conservative? Thats smth needed in Muslim world today. You can just say let them accept samesex marriage decriminalization of drugs stop treatment of ethnic minorities like shit like Saudis e.g. treat South Asian slave workers etc. This is smth society GROWS UP to accept you just DONT PUSH it upon the population. That may suck for you as a left liberal but for a transitional period of time its necessary to let them get away with it. Why do you think theres a penalty for homosexual sex in Tunisia?

To repeat again Brown is a popular western Muslim apologist who has a habit of obscurity and sugar coating thus I felt his thoughts are very much relevant to this discussion.Also this lack of a clarification of consent in the Quran is a great example of how the Quran the infallible word of God should have included a verse clarifying consent.

But even then slavery and sex slavery is still viewed as reprehensible so much Islam is in conflict with accepted international laws.gtbtw read the full q and a to see his perspective.His perspective as a Muslim apologist is clear he approves of slavery and sex slavery just like you and just like Islamic scripture.Whats clear is international law the UN prohibition of slavery and the Geneva conventions prohibit slavery and sex with females captives of war viewing it as war crimesrape. Thats what matters. Given these laws and conventions override Islams rulings and your apologetics and are accepted by the vast majority of the countries in the world including muslim majority countries.You are great example of how Islamic superstition can create one irrational disturbed reprehensible and deluded individual far from the reality of the effects of his superstition upon his fellow humanity.,exmuslim,d1lv80g,1,t5_2s7k2

Most baseball fans in Boston dislike the Yankees. The list goes on. Still its right to say that conservatives believe in gay marriage or liberals believe in gun control.Islam is against homosexuality and most Muslims do not like them. This dislike spans from hating them to the point of wishing death to being fine with them if they dont have sex which is still wrong as having sex is quite important.

This process is called natural selection. He gave us a very clear mechanism through which evolution occurs. He was the first man to do this.He wasnt actually the first man to do this. There were other hypotheses out there before Darwin. For example JeanBaptiste Chevalier de Lamarck thought that as creatures repeatedly did a task their bodies would become better at doing the task and over generations the creature would change into something new e.g. If a deer was to eat leaves from the top of a tree its neck would gradually get longer. It would pass its long neck down to its offspring which would then repeat the process untill after generations you would end up with a giraffe.

Some people were confused about the words of the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until there is nothing between him and it but a cubit then the decree overtakes him and he does a deed of the people of Hell and enters it. And one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until there is nothing between him and it but a cubit then the decree overtakes him and he does a deed of the people of Paradise and enters it. This is an example of what Ibn alQayyim may Allaah have mercy on him tried to point out of saheeh reports which are not understood properly. The answer to this is that it applies to the one who does not do deeds with sincerity and faith rather he does deeds of the people of Paradise as it appears to people only as is explained in another version of the hadeeth that was narrated by alBukhaari  and Muslim  from Sahl who said The Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him and the mushrikeen met in battle and fought. When the Messenger of Allaah peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him went back to his camp and the others went back to their camp there was among the companions of the Messenger of Allaah peace and blessings of Allaah be upon hima man who killed anyone of the enemy who got in his way. They said No one has done better today than So and so. The Messenger of Allaah peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him said Rather he is one of the people of Hell. A man said I am going to follow him. So he went out with him every time that man stopped he stopped with him and when he hastened he hastened with him. He said The man was badly wounded so he sought to hasten his death. He put the handle of his sword on the ground and its tip in the middle of his chest then he leaned on his sword and killed himself. The man went to the Messenger of Allaah peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him and said I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allaah S. He said Why is that? He said The man who you said was one of the people of Hell and the people were astounded by that. I said I will find out about him for you. So I followed him until he was badly wounded then he sought to hasten his death.  He put the handle of his sword on the ground and its tip in the middle of his chest then he leaned on it and killed himself. The Messenger of Allaah peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him said A man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise or so it seems to the people although he is one of the people of Hell and a man may do the deeds of the people of Hell or so it seems to the people although he is one of the people of Paradise. ,exmuslim,d3eees7,1,t5_2s7k2

7760152,0,t1_d3nyfz3,Europe and America made mistakes but the misery of the Arab world is caused mainly by its own failuresMay th  | From the print editionTimekeeper WHEN Sir Mark Sykes and Franois GeorgesPicot secretly drew their lines on the map of the Levant to carve up the Ottoman empire in May  at the height of the first world war they could scarcely have imagined the mess they would set in train a century of imperial betrayal and Arab resentment instability and coups wars displacement occupation and failed peacemaking in Palestine and almost everywhere oppression radicalism and terrorism.In the euphoria of the uprisings in  when one awful Arab autocrat after another was toppled it seemed as if the Arabs were at last turning towards democracy. Instead their condition is more benighted than ever. Under AbdelFattah alSisi Egypt is even more wretched than under the ousted dictator Hosni Mubarak. The state has broken down in Iraq Syria Libya and Yemen. Civil wars rage and sectarianism is rampant fed by the contest between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The jihadist caliphate of Islamic State IS the grotesque outgrowth of Sunni rage is metastasising to other parts of the Arab world.In this sectionThe war withinThe dangers of Duterte HarryA preventable tragedyStay awayThe rule of flawReprintsRelated topicsBashar AssadIsraelUnited StatesEuropeIraqBleak as all this may seem it could become worse still. If the Lebanese civil war of  is any gauge the Syrian one has many years to run. Other places may turn ugly. Algeria faces a leadership crisis the insurgency in Sinai could spread to Egypt proper chaos threatens to overwhelm Jordan Israel could be drawn into the fights on its borders low oil prices are destabilising Gulf states and the proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran might lead to direct fighting.All this is not so much a clash of civilisations as a war within Arab civilisation. Outsiders cannot fix itthough their actions could help make things a bit better or a lot worse. First and foremost a settlement must come from Arabs themselves.Beware of easy answersArab states are suffering a crisis of legitimacy. In a way they have never got over the fall of the Ottoman empire. The prominent ideologiesArabism Islamism and now jihadismhave all sought some greater statehood beyond the frontiers left by the colonisers. Now that states are collapsing Arabs are reverting to ethnic and religious identities. To some the bloodletting resembles the wars of the former Yugoslavia in the s. Others find parallels with the religious strife of Europes Thirty Years War in the th century. Whatever the comparison the crisis of the Arab world is deep and complex. Facile solutions are dangerous. Four ideas in particular need to be repudiated.First many blame the mayhem on Western powersfrom SykesPicot to the creation of Israel the FrancoBritish takeover of the Suez Canal in  and repeated American interventions. Foreigners have often made things worse Americas invasion of Iraq in  released its sectarian demons. But the idea that America should turn away from the regionwhich Barack Obama seems to embracecan be as destabilising as intervention as the catastrophe in Syria shows.Lots of countries have blossomed despite traumatic histories South Korea and Polandnot to mention Israel. As our special report see article sets out the Arab world has suffered from many failures of its own making. Many leaders were despots who masked their autocracy with the rhetoric of Arab unity and the liberation of Palestine and realised neither. Oil money and other rents allowed rulers to buy loyalty pay for oppressive security agencies and preserve failing stateled economic models long abandoned by the rest of the world.A second wrongheaded notion is that redrawing the borders of Arab countries will create more stable states that match the ethnic and religious contours of the population. Not so there are no neat lines in a region where ethnic groups and sects can change from one village or one street to the next. A new SykesPicot risks creating as many injustices as it resolves and may provoke more bloodshed as all try to grab land and expel rivals. Perhaps the Kurds in Iraq and Syria will go their own way denied statehood by the colonisers and oppressed by later regimes they have proved doughty fighters against IS. For the most part though decentralisation and federalism offer better answers and might convince the Kurds to remain within the Arab system. Reducing the powers of the central government should not be seen as further dividing a land that has been unjustly divided. It should instead be seen as the means to reunite states that have already been splintered the alternative to a looser structure is permanent breakup.A third illadvised idea is that Arab autocracy is the way to hold back extremism and chaos. In Egypt Mr Sisis rule is proving as oppressive as it is arbitrary and economically incompetent. Popular discontent is growing. In Syria Bashar alAssad and his allies would like to portray his regime as the only force that can control disorder. The contrary is true Mr Assads violence is the primary cause of the turmoil. Arab authoritarianism is no basis for stability. That much at least should have become clear from the uprisings of .The fourth bad argument is that the disarray is the fault of Islam. Naming the problem as Islam as Donald Trump and some American conservatives seek to do is akin to naming Christianity as the cause of Europes wars and murderous antiSemitism partly true but of little practical help. Which Islam would that be? The headchopping sort espoused by IS the revolutionarystate variety that is decaying in Iran or the political version advocated by the besuited leaders of Ennahda in Tunisia who now call themselves Muslim democrats? To demonise Islam is to strengthen the Manichean vision of IS. The world should instead recognise the variety of thought within Islam support moderate trends and challenge extremists. Without Islam no solution is likely to endure.Reform or perishAll this means that resolving the crisis of the Arab world will be slow and hard. Efforts to contain and bring wars to an end are important. This will require the defeat of IS a political settlement to enfranchise Sunnis in Iraq and Syria and an accommodation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It is just as vital to promote reform in countries that have survived the uprisings. Their rulers must change or risk being cast aside. The old tools of power are weaker oil will remain cheap for a long time and secret policemen cannot stop dissent in a networked world.Kings and presidents thus have to regain the trust of their people. They will need input legitimacy giving space to critics whether liberals or Islamists and ultimately establishing democracy. And they need more of the output variety too strengthening the rule of law and building productive economies able to thrive in a globalised world. That means getting away from the rentier system and keeping cronies at bay.America and Europe cannot impose such a transformation. But the West has influence. It can cajole and encourage Arab rulers to enact reforms. And it can help contain the worst forces such as IS. It should start by supporting the new democracy of Tunisia and political reforms in Moroccothe European Union should for example open its markets to north African products. It is important too that Saudi Arabia opens its society and succeeds in its reforms to wean itself off oil. The big prize is Egypt. Right now Mr Sisi is leading the country to disaster which would be felt across the Arab world and beyond by contrast successful liberalisation would lift the whole region.Without reform the next backlash is only a matter of time. But there is also a great opportunity. The Arabs could flourish again they have great rivers oil beaches archaeology youthful populations a position astride trade routes and near European markets and rich intellectual and scientific traditions. If only their leaders and militiamen would see it.From the print edition Leaders,exmuslim,d3o9phw,1,t5_2s7k2

Yesterday this subreddit was filled with calls echoing the views of Trump of banning Muslims. If we are to analyze it lets assume you put a ban on new Muslims from coming to this country. Thats the easy part. No trade business ties with any Muslims. Now imagine enforcing it through customs and immigration control. Even Pakistan has Christians with Muslim sounding names. Second part of this ban is to deport noncitizen nonresident Muslims. Thats going to cause disruption in the economy and even if it is accomplished many would go underground or change religion underpersecution or attempt to change religion for public purposes. How would you know whether someone has changed hisher religion truly? Would the state impose requirements to visit a church weekly for those who purport to convert? How would Muslim looking exMuslims do? How do you check their exMuslimness? Also there is this pesky thing called the US Constitution. How would you enforce it given the First Amendment. Now you are forcing people to change religion if they want to live in the US.gt Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.Last part of this is what to do with the US citizens and legal residents who are Muslims. Where do you send these US citizens to? Which country would take them?  This guy was a born citizen. If this were to happen how would it impact other minorities? This is a slippery slope that has no end. At this point wouldnt the white supremacists want to deport the blacks back to Africa and Latinos back to South America.

Christians cannot refuse or cherrypick the OT. Christian prophets are all derived from the OT. David Solomon name it. Given that saying that Well OT is violent but we dont give a damn about it anyways is not very true. Jesus himself says he came to fulfill the Law not abolish it. The Law being Torah.gt Instead you are commanded to pray for them and to love them as you love yourself which doesnt imply that you have to excuse their behavior or that you cannot under any circumstances punish them but you must always forgive them and want the best for them.This is there however I dont have to remind you I guess about the verses related to homosexuals.,exmuslim,d4miiv8,1,t5_2s7k2

8067825,0,t3_4po7ot,I think the main challenge when it comes to this question is that we are assuming that th century Arabs understood consent in the same way that we do today.It seems from a lot of evidence that a woman did not always have to give explicit consent and it was often assumed. For example a woman could give her consent to getting married by silence if a shy virgin. Also explains why female children can get married off at any age although consummation is restricted to  according to shias and when her body is ready according to sunnis even though a year old cannot give meaningful consent.The Prophet may have very well been against rape and Im sure he was but because consent was not well understood forms of rape may have occurred that wouldnt have fallen under the thendefinition of rape. So for example say your slave did not actively resist you and you had sex with her. In those times that wouldnt have been deemed as rape. However given the power dynamic of a master and slave even if consent would have been explicitly given Id argue that is not meaningful consent. Would the woman have acted differently if she knew she was free to leave? If her family had not been captured or killed? If she had a support system to fall back on? The only way to verify that a woman is truly consenting is to ensure that her decisions are completely free of these considerations e.g. she is a free person and not a slave. Or else Id argue that her decisions are made under coercion.,exmuslim,d4mwekp,5,t5_2s7k2

Our civilization just owes so much to those regions which were by far the most advanced in early antiquity but today they have some of the most backwards cultures in humanity. I always wonder what those places would be like if Islam was never created.During the th century it was trendy among European aristocrats to imitate Ottoman habits and styles. Nowadays? Not so much. The Islamic world was host to a wide variety of interesting exotic and beautiful cultural curiosities until modern fundamentalisms attempts to purge and reform Islam of foreign nonArab and heretical influences. Of course this doesnt account for the several quasifundamentalist movements that did occur during premodern IslamThe modern day common sense notion of Islam being barbaric primitive and devoid of a prestigious high culture is what I am fighting against in my writings in this thread.Maybe its true that Im giving too much credit to Islam in some of these arguments.

But if our country as a whole become secular the religion will be more laxtamed like Christian in the western world today. what comes in my mind is literally worship whatever you like. heck you can even worship rocks if you want.

8160594,0,t1_d4xlw5a,gt My dad says this. Muslims dont really interact with NonMuslims even on the internet. They just isolate themselves in their faith. When they do interact with a freethinker they go watch a Islamic miracle video to strengthen their faith.My mother also likes to do that. She would also send me videos of animals howling or growling and tells me theyre saying Allah. When I would ask for a real miracle she would get angry Look around you. ALL of this is Allahs work. WE are Allahs work. He is so powerful he created the world created us from clay and lifted prophet Muhammad to the seven heavens!I would state How do you know that actually happened? Just because its written down?Why are you asking this? she asked. Do you question him? Youre   acting like those ATHEISTS who wont believe anything until they see it. DONT ask such things.

Now I know that many people fear this sort of thing because they know that even after conflicts settle down surveillance will still continue indefinitely most likelyBut remember that we shouldnt get sidetracked we should focus on whats actually important and in this case Japan knows theres a threat and Japan doesnt have that many Muslims and knows that the threat has a strong link to the same religion so in order to protect the lives of its people you should know that its actually doing a good thing now is it doing the right thing ? who knows because everyone has their own definition of right.

8169604,0,t1_d4ybgx2,Idk I kinda disagree. The repetition is what made me think that this was real. Even with liberal left wing muslimsyour average conservative what tends to happen is that you can get to a certain point in the dialogue but once you start pointing at holes in core beliefs the show me proof thing that took up a lot of this convo  OP kept pushing theyll inevitably cycle back to the same core ideas the answers are all in the quran lol. Ive been in the same scenario when I was in my early teens its not that your unwilling to question or that youre unable  its almost as if you kind of know without even thinking about it that following the line of questioning  is going to lead to spotting a massive hole in your belief so you kind of avoid it reflexively to keep your world view intact as an unconscious process. And so when someone keeps pushing that line of questioning you keep dodging and swerving and handing out the same lines that were passed down to you. Like I had a convo about hellfire with my mum and when I kept pushing her answer would change itself to remain consistent with her idea of a merciful god not big inconsistencies shed start with you must be a muslim and then say but we all get in jannah through allahs mercy anyway who are we humans to say who gets in and who doesnt and after pushing against it she just fell back on the quran is a divine perfectly preserved copy of the truth. Same repetitious line avoids further convo because it puts the onus on the questioner to commit a specific act before convo continues. And the way this guy structured his responses the inability to elaborate the way he picks and chooses OPs questions to answer the way he fixates on gender at the end  almost as if if OP had admitted they didnt identify as male the validity of their points would be lost and that it was tantamount to a flaw in their logic and thinking. He pushed at it the same way OP pushed at the theological questions  because he sees it as a weakness that he can exploit to show his side is more correct. Idk.

8175328,0,t3_4r9ynl,Haha I never thought of the munafiqeen and apologists as takfiris but technically they are.I would also point out the the moderates and Salafis themselves are themselves a coincidence of opposites. The Salafis would not exist in any substantial numbers without the moderates following a very liberal interpretation of Islam and thus making religion acceptable to most people. The moderates are also required to provide a source of recruits religious people who are radicalized as they study the deen. At the same time the Salafis keep the religion alive preventing any progressive movement from moving the Ummah too far away from the Islam of the Sahaba. If Islam become too liberal such as freely allowing apostasy and criticism it would began to fade away like Christianity in Europe. Salafism while restraining progressive Muslims also enables them giving them a drive to reform Islam so as to dissociate themselves from groups like ISIS.,exmuslim,d4zgrxn,2,t5_2s7k2

This motif is found in the texts of many ancient Mediterranean and NearEastern religions.

For example the Akkadians believed that a man named Adapa the son of Ea attempted to ascend to heaven in order to obtain eternal life but was thrown back down to earth by the gods. An ancient Sumerian story is told of a man named Etana a ruler of the dynasty of Kish who faced a similar fate.

He said Yes I heard the Messenger of Allah  say The first of people for whom judgment will be passed on the Day of Resurrection are three. A man who was martyred. He will be brought and Allah will remind him of His blessings and he will acknowledge them. He will say What did you do with them? He will say I fought for Your sake until I was martyred. He will say You are lying. You fought so that it would be said that soandso is brave and it was said. Then He will order that he be dragged on his face and thrown into the Fire. And the second will be a man who acquired knowledge and taught othersand read Quran. He will be brought and Allah will remind him of His blessings and he will acknowledge them. He will say What did you do with them? He will say I acquired knowledge and taught others and read the Quran for Your sake. He will say You are lying. You acquired knowledge so that it would be said that you were a scholar and you read Quran so that it would be said that you were a reciter and it was said. Then He will order that he be dragged on his face and thrown into the Fire. And the third will be a man whom Allah made rich and gave him all kinds of wealth. He will be brought and Allah will remind him of His blessings and he will acknowledge them. he will say What did you do with them? He will say I did not leave any way that You like wealth to be spent  Abu AbdurRahman AnNasai said I did not understand what You like as I wanted to   but I spent it. He will say You are lying. You spent it so that it would be said that he was generous and it was said. Then he will order that he be dragged on his face and thrown into the Fire.  That is he did not hear or understand what came after it as well as he wanted to but it was similar to what follows regarding the spending.

8437445,0,t1_d5w6qsq,gt Does your knowledge of evolution include the origins of life?The theory of evolution does not cover the origin of life. Thats a big misconception even among supporters. It only deals with the idea that all life can be traced to a common ancestor. Where that ancestor came from is a whole other question. This is called Abiogenesis and remains one of the great unsolved questions in science.gt how can life come out of non living matter? Its not as far fetched as you might think. Life at its simplest form is just a molecule that can replicate itself. All the complexity of having organs or consciousness came later. The line between dead and alive is very vague. You are alive but a rock is dead. Thats easy but when we dig deeper it becomes harder to define where dead ends and alive begins. Is a cell alive? Dig deeper. Is the DNA alive? Dig deeper. Is a protein alive? Dig even deeper. Is a molecule alive?So what Im trying to say here is that life is just a combination of dead things. It is complexity from simplicity. And that has been proven to happen. So yeah living organisms can definitely arise from nonliving matter.gt If life first began at sea how did the first animal to crawl outof the sea breathe? It didnt just happen. It probably took hundreds of generations and mutations for the transition to occur. It was also a gradual process so it wasnt like one day a fish gave birth to a land animal. Most likely they were fish that lived near the coast. Since all animals at this time were fish they were all competing for food inside the water. But food plants outside of water was unclaimed. So a fish that had a mutation that allowed it to survive outside of water for a few seconds would have found a lot of food that no one was competing for. So this fish reproduces a lot. One of its descendants gets better at living outside of water so it has the advantage and it reproduces more. And this keeps going for hundreds and hundreds of generations until you finally have a fish that can live in both land and water at the same time. Essentially the first amphibians.In  a team of paleontologists uncovered a fossil of a creature they called the Tiktaalik This fascinating creature had features of both fish and tetrapods the first animals with four legs. It had fins gills and scales just like fish. But it also had skeletal features that we would see later in land animals such as a flat skull with eyes on top distinct shoulder and neck bones a rib cage that suggests an early form of lungs ... etc.,exmuslim,d5w7xml,14,t5_2s7k2

8482226,0,t3_4vvnrx,gtno contradiction in the QuranOh come on first off even if this was true this doesnt prove that the quran wasnt the work of Muhammad. Plenty of works lack verifiable inconsistencies. According to this line of thinking are they considered beyond human authorship as well? This argument boils down to Muhammad is too stupid on his own to produce something without contradictions let alone over the course of  decades therefore Islam is true. That is a ridiculously bad argument.Second I argue that there are contradictions in the quran. They come in numerous forms. Some theological such as free will vs. predestination others in describing events or attributes such below to even comparing how dialogue differs in the retelling of the same stories over multiple places in the quran. Heres one for instance... The Quran is explicit in multiple verses that sinning is only on the individual who sinned that each person is held accountable only for what they themselves have done. This is sensible as assuming people have free will to choose for themselves it makes little sense for someone to suffer divine retribution for anothers wrongdoing. For each person is a burden consisting of the evil that theyve done of what theyve earned and they will be made to suffer this evil on the day of judgement. A man is alone with what hes done for what is justice but punishment for the works of his own hands? Below are verses that assert such ideasgt Say Is it other than Allah I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? And every soul earns not except against itself and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.gt And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls to its load nothing of it will be carried even if he should be a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for his soul. And to Allah is the destination.gt And whoever commits a sin only earns it against himself. And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.gt Whoever is guided is only guided for his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And never would We punish until We sent a messenger.Yet for all this talk of justice there is a crack within the Quran as demonstrated belowVs.gt That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they misguide without knowledge. Unquestionably evil is that which they bear.So according to various verses none bearer of burden will bear the burden of another yet the quran also claims that some will have to bear the burden of others. In addition this contradicts the notion that you only earn sin upon yourself as given by  because there are those who will suffer that which others have earned according to .gtthe historical impossibility to being from Muhammad because it is was illiterate and with no specific inclination neither poetry nor philosophy he was oppressed and he havent the time to rule Medina and at the same time being inspired to produce by itself the Verses nor he have the time to deal with Meccans and producing the Verses I dont know what the argument is here. He couldnt have produced a religious work because he was a backwater dumb bell? This is kind of similar to your first point of no contradictions. As for not having the time Muhammads career was supposedly over the course of a very long time.  something years is plenty long to compose a bunch of quasi religious sermons from a cult leader. gtan amazing amount of scientific facts as the  deep ways in the sea I dont understand is this the internal wave thing? If so gtif Muhammad was a selfdeluded guy why the rivals couldnt bring similar Verses when he ask about their veracity?What is the criteria of the challenge? What does it mean to produce something like the quran? I think thats the main problem its a test without win conditions. Additionally even if something is unique their are numerous works that have the unique touch of their creators. A work like Shakespeare isnt divine because its unique. And neither would the quran. ,exmuslim,d61tmll,8,t5_2s7k2

You have this persistant image of the good West selflessly helping the backward East its almost childish in its simplicity. The alliance we agreed on was with EU not with Muslim countries. We would help any member if they were stricken by war or similar catastrophe as we agreed to give money to help Greece. If individual countries especially Germany that has a lot to atone for want to take on the refugies that is their choice. So we are cynical and selfserving? Oh yes please! We totally are. Finally we can be. In the beginning of the Ukranian war our government extended invitation to the affected regions and several dozens families took us on the offer that might not seem like much but we are a really small country. Flats paid for for few years language and job assistance not that they really needed it. Because their second generation will be just us Czechs and that is the point.Also in EU  work market is open because it profits the members not because it is a nice thing to do. My cousin is a nurse she was approached by a UK recruiter almost all jobs are contracted in here nobody just travels and trusts hisher luck who got her contacts through her classmate. She refused and in a few months she got another even better offer and accepted. It was a shitty job but comparably wellpaid. The patients were really condescending towards her as to an Eastern European but such was their prerogative. In three years she completely lost her accent and got a better job now there is nothing to differentiate her from an Englishwoman. In few years she got married when I was visiting her she was raving about UK tv shows and cooking me their cuisine. Should she have a child I have no doubt that it will be raised English.

8756637,0,t1_d704has,Thats a claim by NGOs which were the beneficiaries of the foreign funds I mentioned earlier. Not the official stats. Here are some official stats. In any case those claims were made just around the time of Delhi elections where the media favorite party was fighting for its comeback. For example one case of Church vandalism in Delhi was found to be a robbery. In another highly publicized case of a gangrape of a nun in the West Bengal district the perps were found to be Muslim migrants from Bangladesh even before the arrests were made some Muslim apologist journalists declared that Hindu rightwing elements were behind that incident. And then there was the Mangalore Church attack where the perps were found to be members of the Church itself.In any case all these Christian persecution that you talk about was highlighted only around the Delhi elections and when the Indian home ministry was targeting NGOs for their dubious sources of funds.While I do agree that India does have a few fringe fundie Hindu elements those would engage in attacks against minorities to claim that they have the backing of the govt. or to even say that the govt. does nothing against them is just plain ignorant. Police in every state act against these fringe elements like the VHP and in fact just last week Modi accused their members of engaging in criminal activities under the cover of fighting for the Hindu cause.To compare Trump and Modi is again ignorance. When did Modi ever say that MuslimsChristians do not belong in India? If anything Modis idea of secularism is India first.

8806061,0,t1_d754e7k,gtIt seems like special pleading to say infinity does not exist and then say except for this one thing....Ive never claimed God is a quantitative infinity.  gtI have no problem with infinity Inflation predicts that it exists in at least one direction maybe two.Yes but there is a difference between a potential infinity and an actual infinity.  One is exists in math the other doesnt exist in reality.  If you want we can have a discussion on the nature of infinity but please only if you are actually interested.  I wasnt wanting a big debate when I posted my original commentjust trying to stop the fingernails on the chalkboard when someone asks Who created God?.gtThey dont hand wave it they violate it. Thats something that quantum mechanics can do  violate the classical laws. Yes they violate it and no they cannot do that just cause and Vilenkin calls them on it in his lectures.  To be fair we do not yet know if the second law holds at the quantum level but Aron Wall has argued that it likely will because the second law is based on statistical configurations.  Again if we can discard the laws whenever we want then why is a YEC wrong for saying the laws of physics may have changed over time?  If we have no standard for doing science anything and everything is up for grabs no matter how ridiculous.  We must have an open mind and examine all possibilities but not so open that our brains fall out.gtEternal inflation violates the nd law in both directions unless you think that an infinite and exponentially increasing in rate number of big bangs coheres with the nd law somehow.Eternal inflation is only eternal into the future and it does not violate the nd law going into the future.  gtI dont see why you object to infinity in one direction but not in the other when the same objection based on inapplicable classical mechanics applies to both.When one applies infinity to reality it leads to logical absurdities.  Heading towards infinity in one direction is not a true infinity.  It is a potential infinity but any time from the beginning to the current time is a finite distance thus it never becomes actual.  If there was an infinite past then even after an infinite amount of time we still would never reach the present because there would always be more time between the infinite past and now.  Philosophers figured this out thousands of years ago science has finally caught up.gtDo you agree that the leading theory of cosmic origins inflation implies infinity does exist contrary to your claim?It is a potential infinity that goes into the future not an actual or real infinity from the infinite past.  As Vilenkin says around minute I described the picture of the universe which expands without bound and with this eternal inflation and new big bangs occurring all the time.  So this universe doesnt have an end and a natural question to ask here is it possible that it also has no beginning?  Many people find this possibility very attractive because a beginning of course has many perplexing problems associated with it.  In particular what caused the beginning of the universe?  What sets the initial conditions of the beginning of the universe?  So this universe without a beginning was an attractive possibility but there is an unexpected obstacle towards constructing such a picture.Even though inflation is eternal to the future it cannot be eternal to the past.gtIf we are allowed to discard the laws of physics at will then there is no such thing as empiricism.gtgtYou seem to me to be making a category error applying the laws of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.I simply recognizing the high probability that we will continue to build on the evidence we have not discard it as our knowledge grows.gtQuantum energy fluctuations virtual particles they violate the nd law. Their cause is the basic structure and nature of the cosmos which may itself be uncaused. may. No they do not violate the nd law.  As I said above we really dont know if the nd law applies at the quantum level or not but it is likely to.  gtArent you steelmanning our knowledge of physics to say our current knowledge is complete and accurate to reality?Im not saying our knowledge is complete I do not think the evidence we have can be discarded just because an unwanted answer is reached.  It would be like me saying that we dont know everything about evolution so we shouldnt believe it because something else may come along and replace it.  The reality is we will improve our knowledge of evolution but it will never be entirely discarded.

Theology was an inevitable thing in the past and Islam was in no way a negligible factor in the foundation of this Golden Age. Islam in its fluid form back then was a virtue and not a vice.

My friends always tell me how much they love me and how I always made them feel better when things are going down. After that I gave up on those Arabs and decided they were not worth my time.

I was told that it was absolutely imperative to have something to eat before you start your fast like it was a RULE and if you didnt do so  your fast doesnt count.... well thats a load of horseshit  the prophet said something like before your fast glass of water and some dates if you dont have dates then a glass of water  who practices this??? no muslim that i know of.anyway there is proven benefits to fasting. ,exmuslim,d7y72k6,3,t5_2s7k2

Parents are told that they will go to hell if they dont raise Muslim children.I love my parents too but it took me a while to realise that their love is conditional. Islam comes first and family later. I bought my own house and moved out a year later. There was a lot of grief and arguments but Ive held out on my own. Its been about  years since then. I have different relationships with my family now and I accept them on my own terms. There was more hassle when the issue of marriage comes up and Ive had more grief when my GF started to live with me and even more grief and pressure to have a nikkah we are both atheists. There has been no end to the emotional abuse from my mother. My family too cares about reputation but this is in their own heads. Its only perceived reputation. Ive been an exmoose openly and was not incloset during any part of it. Something Ive figured out by doing it all in the open is that a lot of the extended family doesnt really care about it all.

9219021,0,t3_56lbbn,For me it took a long process of moving from being heavily devouted to slowly moving out of it. So basically I come from an American Lebanese background. My parents were more of the liberal and open type of Muslims who didnt force Islam on me when I was young but nudged on it from time to time telling me to read the Quran and how to pray learning the most important verses etc.. That was until I became  did I believe it was my duty as a Muslim to start taking my religion seriously and I did at the beginning. Until my parents took me back to lebanon and enlisted me in a secular school My parents never wanted to put me in a Islamic school since they were never as good. So as you can tell the pressure began there almost all my friends where athiests agnostics laxed Muslims or exmuslims. The first few years I saw changes in how I saw Islam. From stopping reading the fatiha when I start a test to cursing and saying perverted jokes from time to time. Along with all of this was the internet which really helped me going especially homosexuality. Since the internet basically shits on religion it was hard for me to keep up with my religious beliefs around this pressure. I stayed true to praying fasting reading the quran and keep my thoughts and mouth clean but it was slowly deprecating away from me. I couldnt focus at all when I prayed or read the Quran I just felt it was a waste when I could just study My tolerance toward liberal ways of thinking started to grow. I got bored of the conservative lifestyle that Islam gave me and all the rules I had to follow and the ignorant and sexist verses from the Quran that I had to defend but still doubted internally. I was your basic muslim apologist and thought about my internal arguments pretty well.But at the end... I got fed up. Fed up of all this boring bullshit. There isnt anything fun about Islam comparing what the liberal west has to offer. When I asked my parents what happens to people who are born and die as atheists they say we dont know and immediatly after that I kept telling myself how much I wish I was born in an atheist family and imagning me hanging out with my friends and having drinks getting a girlfriend and having sex. So I decided one day that I had to find out if Islam was really worth this boring life of mine. So I went to research about it for a month and through that time found this place and then it just went down hill I had to say it to myself but I left Islam. I only told my secular friends and they were all happy and proud for what I have done. I never told any of my family members but I probably will when I become financially independent. Im not sure what theyll do but I dont want to live my self rotated around a lie. ,exmuslim,d8kkty3,3,t5_2s7k2

Also the Muslim lobbies are neither that powerful nor do the have the same level of clout as the Israeli lobby. Further they fight with each other as they hate each other and undermine each other. And Muslim lobbies also are ideologically not really aligned with American interest which is the main tool for intervention so their ability to affect things is limited by that.

Arab lobbies i.e. Gulf nations spend way more money and have way more influence than Jewish lobbies. Jewish lobbies just seem successful because a lot of Americans are sympathetic to them. Its also a fact that the Saudi lobby is aligned in its interests with Israel. Arabs exercise a huge amount of control in both the UN where they make up the largest group in the nonaligned movement and redirect the UN to constantly condemn Israel while ignoring Muslim crimes and the USA where they dominate think tanks in Washington through bribe sorry donations and own tons of politicians like Clinton and Bush. A Saudi prince even holds the largest share in Twitter and helped save the company is it a coincidence that theyre also very hostile to exmuslims criticism of Islam in general Christian conservatives etc? This is called soft power and the Saudis are great at it thanks to their endless supply of oil money in contrast to the USA who project soft power through their culture.Here is Obama discussing Arab Occupied Territory at Washington DCgtA widely held sentiment inside the White House is that many of the most prominent foreignpolicy think tanks in Washington are doing the bidding of their Arab and proIsrael funders. Ive heard one administration official refer to Massachusetts Avenue the home of many of these think tanks as Araboccupied territory. ,exmuslim,d8pga9g,2,t5_2s7k2

A perfect religion that supposes everything will be taken care of by Allah almighty yet people still deny him. They will react it with hostility at first since cognitive bias has engulf their very minds but sooner or later these things will start to land inside their heads and haunt them. I just cant wait till we can all just exist in peace without the need to confirm our ideological differences. Without having to bring up myth in every part of life to affirm our behaviors. Many religious folks are living through fear of hell and reward in heaven. Just feelings and not reality. The supposed hope they have is what motivates their lives everyday if not supplements it. Why cant we all just look into ourselves not gods or angels. There is no need to refer to supernatural claims without any referent to reality.Just live life live with other humans such as yourself. Actions of others and of yours combined to form the society we live in. Nothing more than that. No god no prophet. Just us and our lives. I may just be too optimistic but whatever. ,exmuslim,d8rqxzp,4,t5_2s7k2

Not everyone is on this sub to Meetup with other exmuslims I for one could care less if people had meetups here and am not looking for any exmuslim friends. If we meet in real life randomly and you become my friend and are an exmuslim then great! Ill treat you like I treat my other friends.  . Just because people are from the area you are from does not necessarily mean that they would be interested in meeting up with you.   . Meeting up with other exmuslims does not necessarily improve your life lol. The person who is in that area will still leave their religionfamily if they family disowns them when they are financially stable. Meeting other exmuslims does nothing to improve their life. They can have discussions and friendships with people online and later on meetup with them but meeting up with someone you dont really know isnt something many people are interested in.   .  gtHow can you expect yourself to change or improve your life if you continue to ignore or avoid meeting people that might have similar views with you.  What change will that create? How will you be able to help them? Are you going to be giving them a place to stay? Are you going to be there for them for emotional support? not like they might not already have friends irl who are able to emotionally support them.     . Honestly dude if you are looking just for friends with similar views look for a hobby you like and find people who like that hobby as well. Meetup.com is a good way to meet people who have similar hobbies as yours.  If youre looking for someone just to talk about being exmuslim with then just make a post on here looking for a friend to talk to.   gtGo burn in whatever unholy place you guys believe in or believe muslims believe in.  Youre as shitty as the followers of such religions if you truly wish for people to burn for eternity p.s. hell isnt real just because they dont want to be your friend then you need to work on your anger problems .,exmuslim,d8tw1jf,5,t5_2s7k2

QED he is not entirely Merciful as defined by the Quran.gt Reductio ad absurdumYes I am using the nd form referred to in your quote the form that can demonstrate that a statement is false by showing false untenable or absurd results follow from accepting the statement.gt Here is a question for you. If Allah SWT didnt create the universe then the universe created itself out of nothing. Do you disagree?You have presented a false dichotomy there thats a logical fallacy so I disagree.Just sticking with supernatural means which youre fond of the universe could have been created by an eternal omnipotent being that was not omniscient indeed it could have created the universe unconsciously without knowing it created the universe. It was just existing for eternity occasionally doing unconscious things according to its base characteristics such as making trillions of universes each one with different attributes.Once our universe was existing this unconscious creator doesnt need to continue existing either  this conceptual reality setup is contingent on the Creator for the First Cause but it is not continually contingent.And so the unconscious Creator could have existed eternally in the past Has no beginning like Allah is conceived to be but now be dead and no longer existing. A car does not cease to exist when the car mechanic dies after all.So there you go Ive given you an alternative option The Eternal Omnipotent Yet Unconscious Creator Who Later Died.Lets call him The UC for short.I do happen to think that there are other nonsupernatural options that dont require a creation exnihilo but I neednt raise them yet all you asked for was a single point of disagreement on the AllahNothing dichotomy.I also think that its logically invalid according to the rules of logic to say that nothing can come from nothing which I assume you were heading toward which Ill elaborate on if you like even though I dont actually actively believe the universe came from nothing.,exmuslim,d90duhv,1,t5_2s7k2

Im required to just accept everything islam tells me without questioning it but if islam was real Id come to the conclusion that its the truth. I have never in my life been religious and I have always considered religion to be a private matter between the individual and God. I was secular from a young age and I found the idea of the state enforcing religion to be sickening. The existence of thousands of religious sects proves religion is made up. Muslims really make me angry with their intolerance and how they insult other religions.  All religions are equally ridiculous and were written down and invented by con men that wanted power.  As someone that grew up a muslim I can tell you first hand just how much of a threat islam is. It is the worst religion by far and is a direct threat to global human civilisation.  Islam is the cancer of religions and words cannot describe how much I hate this th century arab bedouin desert cult that inspires normal humans to commit heinous crime by promising  virgins in some made up heaven that they heard from Persian tales during this era.

Just ask them to present you with reasons that you should in fact wear it and then tell them why those arent valid.In addition to that it might help you to do some research into the history of Hijab in Islam and why it was prescribed in the first place because as far as I know one of the reasons it came about was to distinguish free women from slave women. But these are extra stuff that you dont need to get into in order to have an honest conversation with your family and friends.Hope everything goes well Edit As for the not looking good when you take it off this is completely normal since youve worn it for a very long time I assume.

9957306,0,t3_5i537n,Historically the location has been accounted as being between the borders of Iraq and modern day Saudi Arabia. This is in accordance to Najd Qarnu ashShaytaan the definition of Najd depends on ones own location and from Madina Najd would be Iraq. The area is indicated by various scholars of hadith as to be in accordance with this.Ibn Hajar alAsqalani said after quoting the words of alKhattaabee explaining the meaning of Qarn horn and others have said that the People of the East were disbelievers at that time and the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam informed us that the trials and tribulations would arise from that direction and it was as he said. And the first of the trials that arose arose from the direction of the east and they were the reason for the splitting of the Muslim ranks and this is what Satan loves and delights in. Likewise the innovations appeared from that direction. Ibn Hajr quoted alKhattabi as sayingThe najd is in the direction of the east and for the one who is in Madeenah then his Najd would be the desert of Iraaq and its regions for this is to the east of the People of Madeenah. The basic meaning of Najd is that which is raisedelevated from the earth in contravention to alGawr for that is what is lower than it. Tihaamah the coastal plain along the southwestern and southern shores of the Arabian Peninsula is entirely alGawr and Mecca is in Tihaamah.... by this saying of alKhattaabee the weakness of the saying of adDaawodee is understood that Najd is in the direction of Iraq min Nahiya alIraq for he suggests that Najd is a specific place. This is not the case rather everything that is elevated with respect to what adjoins it is called Najd and the lower area called Gawr.The celebrated th century historian Ali ibn alAthir who had frequently traveled to Iraq during the era of Saladin and had written his monumental work alKamil fi atTarikh The Complete History writes in his work alNihyah Najd is the highland region. This name is given to area beyond the Hijz towards IraqIt mentions Iraq and says najd is iraq and we see what is happening in iraq.,exmuslim,db5gnk6,1,t5_2s7k2

9976077,0,t1_db7v363,gtThe fact that we have FreeWill has been proven repeatedly through multiple philosophical models. Determinism is as dead as doornail.Im not a philosopher Im actually in science. Scientifically speaking determinism is a very strong contender. Why do you say its dead?gtIf my will is incorporeal how could it be programmed by chance?By incorporeal Im assuming you mean non material. If the mind is non material it is still tied in heavily with the brain and genetics and thus preprogrammed. Your will is a combination of your environment your genetic makeup your neural architecture and the general chaos of the brain. The experience of your will might be incorporeal but its still heavily tied in to physical factors.gt In a sense He does not know your action till you have done it but then the moment at which you have done it is already Now for HimThen how is God omniscient? If he doesnt know what I will do till I do it that nullifies his omniscience. gtGod does not foresee anything because that implies that He views time in a linear fashion as we do rather than knowing it all immediately which is what Omniscience is.If God is omniscient then he knows it all which still basically means he will know what we will do and when. Our universe runs on physical laws which would be created by an omnipotent god and still have deterministic principles to it. Thus God understands determinism and knows that we are slaves to it. If you say God introduces chance into the universe through quantum mechanics then God must not know what the outcome of the universe is nullifying his own omniscience. For an omniscient God to exist the universe has to be deterministic.Now if God is omniscient and operating on a non linear idea of time it still doesnt explain how he can judge beings that live in a universe that runs on linear time. He knows we are bound to physical laws and he knows that our brains are bound to these laws as well. We may experience subjective things differently but our overall actions are heavily guided by deterministic action. If God knows everything then God will know that we will sin. If God knows we will sin and punishes us after creating us as slaves to a deterministic universe then that God is evil. ,exmuslim,db7wsjn,1,t5_2s7k2

Now the question Do you think that these new religious texts would look ANYTHING like what we have today in the old and new testaments and the koran?Would there be a story of a Mohammed? No because that was wiped from our memories. Would there be a story of a prophet that brought the word of the deity to earth? Would it be posted onto reddit or tweeted on twitter?Jesus? Moses? Abraham? Circumcision? None of it.All of these things are manmade stories that claim to be derived from a deity.The best example of this is when it happened most recently with the Mormons and Joseph Smith. South Park does an amazing parody of the events that led to the creation of the Mormon church and all the miracles that led to it.As incredulous as that story sounds so too do the stories of Abraham Moses Jesus  Saul Paul of Tarsus and Mohammed sound.

Forget no true scotsman for a second lets deal with reality.gt because you will never call something a real Islamic country unless its  perfect which is statistically impossible so youll deflect any criticism by saying that they dont rule with True Islam.Thats not true. Umayyad Abbasid and Ottoman Caliphates werent perfect at all times. But you cant critisize Islam when Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia are ruling by man made laws. That makes no sense.gt so most of the people use Islamic morality and practices to combat Issues on a social level which has also proven to be a complete failure. Either they rule by Islam or they dont. And they dont. You are like trying to find ways to blame Islam. Its ridiculous.gt Anyway my criticisms are rooted in Islamic theology not whether country X is  Islamic or not because in my opinion they would be a hell of a lot worse if they decided to follow Islam like Mohammed did. Youd get something really close to ISIS if that was the case.Was the Rashidun Caliphate like ISIS? Theres a trend on this subreddit of just pure ignorance on Islam. Which is not surprising.

10535433,0,t1_dd203kd,Im a never moose. I changed my flair to avoid confusion since it didnt specifically say before.Look... Nobody outside of country X who isnt a citizen of X has some sort of inherent right to enter country X. With that said I personally would like to grant the privilege for people such as exMuslims or anyone who is unfairly persecuted under Islamic doctrine or communist doctrine in North Korea etc to escape to the US. But I dont want people who chant death to America being allowed in.I think people deserve the right to freedom wherever they are as long as they reciprocate that freedom to others. Ideally that would be possible everywhere and people wouldnt be having to escape to somewhere else all the time but this idea hasnt exactly caught on everywhere.I dont think in terms of a single issue. You cant for example ignore all security precautions just because exMuslims or others minding their own business would be unfairly subjected to them. If you did then wed end up with no security precautions because it would be impossible otherwise.It is certainly arguable whether this recent restriction is helpful or not regarding security and diplomacy but I can tell you that part of why it is happening is because all training regarding Islamist jihad ideology was removed from federal manuals and training programs for the sake of not offending Muslims or something by suggesting that there might be anything Islamic about terrorist jihad.In other words the strategy has been to avoid the issue rather than force people especially Muslims to come to terms with the ideological problems in Islam.This created a lot of suspicion that vetting was being rendered ineffective as it was with the San Bernardino shooters by political correctness. Therefore you get a temporary ban until procedures and training can be reviewed.,exmuslim,dd2b33w,1,t5_2s7k2

It was Obama who considered these countries a threat first. Trump banned seven countries for  days using Obamas list.gtWhat he didnt dogtBase it on religiongtDo it out of the blueIm actually flabbergasted at the stupidity displayed here.Trumps ban isnt based on religion. It currently bans everyone including nonMuslims. Hes said minorities will be given priority later but its not in effect yet.How can it target Muslims if the vast majority of Muslims states are not on the list? Only a fraction are banned and they all except Iran happen to be failed states that have produced terrorists whove attacked the West multiple times. As for out of the blue  Is this brain dead article writer seriously expecting me to believe that Islamic terrorism in EuropeUSA hasnt been a trigger for this thing? That ISIS openly saying theyll exploit the refugee crisis to sneak in operatives isnt a trigger?

10718745,0,t3_5t9b89,not iranian but my take is that many iranians outside iran arent raised in the same cutthroat way that many sunnis are. as far as i know a lot of the shia islam in iran is more spiritual than practical meaning that they dont worry about silly hadiths that tell them how to walk inside a room or even focus on making all of their prayers so much as simply having faith comparing sunnism in which people are constantly told by backwater imams that the slightest mistake will result in  snakes biting them in the afterlife or something. an iranian atheist kid henceforth probably wouldnt have the same burning hatred for islam as a typical lower middle class pakistani kid who used to get beaten for listening to music or not praying  times a day simply because in the way things are done in their respective countries culture. as a result youd be less likely to see them on places like this.many of the western ones have attitudes like muslim? oh yeah im one of those while getting wasted in a club or smoking weed because they simply were raised in such a liberal and more relaxed way by their parents that they are able to do so. i feel like im generalizing a whole lot by saying this but just my take. theyre not as seriously exmuslim because they simply have enough mental freedom to push their islam into the background and keep it there while living a secular lifestyle. most arabs and south asians would struggle with that whereas almost seems expected from iranians. however i have noticed that iranian women tend to hold onto their islamic identity a heck of a lot stronger than the men do for whatever reason. but all of them as a whole are clinging onto their muslim identity stronger with this whole trump BS thing going on theyve started sharing im muslim and proud images right after posting about getting drunk or high as ridiculous as that seems well at least the ones on my social media are.,exmuslim,ddlk4zt,6,t5_2s7k2

10825826,0,t1_ddwlimz,Im quite confused with your comments. First of all the main reason why this sub even exists is because weve all been tired of not being able to do as we please. We had no choice until we left this religion. Second the first thing someone does in any case is not always talking to that person. Im not sure where you are coming from but Im sure even you have had trouble talking to someone about a certain subject and instead tried getting advice first? If not then well kudos to you. Sometimes people just want someone elses perspective and that is absolutely ok to do. And last yeah for the sake of the truth I cant know for sure. But again do you realise which sub this is? I guarantee you a lot of girls who are stuck with this religion are indeed virgins. Not everyone goes out of their way to have that experience. Most wait until they get married. Some do it sure but its the minority. And I believe my sister is not in that minority. I think your comments are kind of not helpful in any way and you should rethink commenting until you are sure you are not wasting your time. Obviously its not easy to figure out the tone of a comment because its text but I do feel like you are not even trying to be helpful. If your intentions are well meant then Im sorry. ,exmuslim,ddwlvwh,1,t5_2s7k2

Later clerics wrote them anyway and considered that as acceptable heresy. However the quranistanti hadith people are also considered heretics by mainstream muslim clerics.

11063176,0,t1_dekrn4e,I find that most of the time Islamonauts only like to claim that Islam is a feminist religion simply because feminism like slavery is a progressive political movement built on enlightened ideals and Muslims like claiming everything thats progressive as theirs.The reason is that Islam retards development and progress. It is ultraconservative regressive and totalitarian. It is inimical to new ideas and concepts as these are naturally competitive to Islams domination of the intellect.When Islamonauts claim Islam is feminist and gave women rights before feminism ask What rights did Islam give women that they didnt have before?Some will talk about the burial of infant daughters but that is female infanticide a form of ritual murder which is wrong because it is murder but there are rationales why it exists. Again ask specifically what rights did Islam give women that they didnt have before Islam.At this point Islamonauts flounder and answer with something like Islam is a feminist religion and if you dont like it youre a poopoo head or something similar. This is tacky ad hominem. It means they dont know.Some might speak of Khadija a strong independent and wealthy woman a feminist paragon to be sure but she was independent and wealthy long before she married Muhammad.Some might speak of Aisha and she indeed had a an independent spirit cunning wit and intelligence but she used that cunning wit and intelligence to openly disparage Muhammads prophethood and the verses he claimed were revealed to him from Allah by the angel Jibreel. Muhammad also violently assaulted Aisha when she expressed her independence but not asking permission to move out of the house or even doing so without an escort. But if she angered or insulted Muhammad which part of Islam gave her the rights to insult the Korans verses and leave the house alone but be beaten by Muhammad for doing so? Is the beating she suffered also a right given to women by the feminist religion of Islam?,exmuslim,delzr98,1,t5_2s7k2

I am no republican but Ive read enough of their editorials to know that France is a very popular topic of discussion.Sweden actually does have some problems that are worth noting. First of all they dont have a history of colonizing Muslim countries so theres no reason why Muslims should feel resentful or bitter about being in Sweden in the first place. Some were pushed to France because of colonial pressures but anyone who went to Sweden elected to go.So why have the ramifications been so god awful? Many have contempt for the native Swedes are way overrepresented in crime underrepresented in positive contributions in society cost more to the tax system than they pay in and Sweden exports more jihadists than other countries. Why is this? The Swedes did everything they were supposed to do to make Muslim immigrants feel warmly to them. They met all their needs even set up sharia funds at their national bank which nobody bought and just generally bent over backwards. They took in far more migrants than other countries so families could stay together. So why hasnt it turned out to be like regressive academics promised? We could dissect other countries like France and point out how they were truly assholes. But not Sweden. They followed leftist directions as well as they could. Yes some snaky privateers got involved but migrants went from being unfed homeless and with no medicine to having all their physical needs met and more.Theres no conspiracy of all Muslims to crush Europe to set up a caliphate. There IS a cultural problem that is ubiquitous enough that they are harming Europeans the same way they harmed themselves. There IS a risk that the coming backlash will harm Muslims in Europe.

We have this strange feeling that we owe them but we dont really they should just accept us but we try to keep them happy.Your boyfriend wont tell them he doesnt give a famp as he unfortunately needs their approvallike me. Truth is there needs to be some compromise He cant stay with his parents all the time he could visit them but you have to know his parents if  you are going to be a part of his life then you have to know if his parents will accept youas he is not going to give them up.

11457383,0,t1_dfuo2vk,To elaborate on my point the reason I think Christianity was easier to reform is by the nature of how Christians view the text.

Since Jesus himself admitted that the old book isnt always right and that being kind and forgiving is more important than anything else even more important than the word of the Old Testament! that opens all kinds of doors for interpreting the Bible in the most inclusive prohuman rights way possible. The fact that Christians cherrypick with the Bible is actually a good thing imo.I dont see how Islam can be reformed until the idea that the Quran is literally divine stops being mainstream.Also you misinterpreted that poll.

And when you see two persons falling into dispute amongst themselves for the space of a brick than get out of that. He Abu Dharr said I saw Abd alRahman b. Shurahbil b.
