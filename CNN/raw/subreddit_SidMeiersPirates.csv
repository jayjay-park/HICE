7043807,0,t3_4c3q7m,Update I have discovered that I am married to the Governor of Caracass daughter. So thats why I cant capture the city.Maracaibo however remains an oddity. I captured two other cities and instead gave them to the Dutch hoping maybe if I attacked and took them back itd get Maracaibos anger back up at me. Turns out I cant take either of those either nor get them to attack. So now there are three damned Dutch cities and one Spanish one. My glorious Empire weeps for my failures. ,SidMeiersPirates,d1eru6c,2,t5_379gf
