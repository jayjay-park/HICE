408429,0,t3_1yqool,Okay its originally a panel manga writtenillustrated by Tachi.According to Wikipedia the manga is still running and has been since March . BUT also according to Wikipedia the anime version is only scheduled for  episodes this season. A bit more digging may turn up plans for more seasons but I havent looked yet. I would say however if the show becomes bigger that it could potentially run for multiple seasons.I sincerely hope it isnt fated to run the way too many good anime have and die after one season.,SakuraTrick,cfn3mf2,4,t5_2zsqc

3452564,0,t1_cplt8x7,Oh still have the last  episodes left so at least I can die from cuteness for a bit longer. P Also Im very happy to go over to the Yuri side. Hard to say whether I should love or hate PMMM and this anime for getting me addicted to Yuri but for now... I definitely love them both. ,SakuraTrick,cplti1l,2,t5_2zsqc

5430934,0,t1_cw5tu8k,Minor correction but Im pretty sure Tachis female. Still I definitely agree we need to support her work for more Sakura Trick goodness! Also when I looked up Tachi to make sure I wasnt making an idiot out of myself I found out that shes working on another yuri manga for Kirara Soukaku Kankei! I cant find any info on it besides the fact that there are apparently twins in a love triangle but has anyone else heard about this? Is anyone translating it?,SakuraTrick,cw5uvc9,2,t5_2zsqc
6773036,0,t1_d0jyt20,Not reallyFirst if you pay attention youll notice that over half the anime in the form of manga is nowhere to be found in the vol  chapters included in the vol  you claim to exist in that site.Secondly heres SHiN explicitly saying that they havent translated Vol nor most of Vol  In case you dont know SHiN is from lazylily the one group that translated the manga and anime and that is their official site.Plus here is SHiN saying that they will translate the last  chapters of volume  And finally if you go to the last page of what that site claims to be chapter  which it is youll see this It says Chapter But if you go to what that site claims to be chapter  which it isnt and go to the last page youll find this There it says Chapter   s Yes it also says Volume  chapter  but that means that it is the th chapter of volume  not the th chapter of the manga overall.So based on all that Im pretty sure that Vol  and most of  havent been translated yet.Good day.,SakuraTrick,d0k0859,1,t5_2zsqc
