425964,0,t1_cfe0tfj,Im convinced your system is worse. There are things I might change beause I have yet to use my timeline for...anything...except notifications I ignored but I think yours is a big step in the wrong direction. I dont mind live cards bt home and settings because its still just  motion to get bt home and settings...just  big fast swipe. You dont have to do them individually. Having too many live cards is a bit of a problem but IMHO its a better solution to a run fewer livecard apps b have finergrained controls about what gets a tile Google Now takes like  when its in give you everything mode time to next location itenerary weather and nearby places on mine or c both. The big thing that your system seems to miss is that Immersive Experiences are supposed to be...immersive. If Im using mapss guidance a hypotehtical correct carplanebike HUD or an augmentedreality app....I want it to be there when I glance up or tap. It should take over the home screen. If thats not the behavior I want then the app shouldnt be immersive or I should quit it. I sure as  dont want to do anything but glance up if Im getting Maps guidance on a motorcycle because I cant touch Glass even if I wanted to.That being said it makes a bit more sense if you think of the home screen as the lowestpriority immersive app which I think is the right call. I really dont want to sound like Im bashing you...but if Glass worked the way you describe I would have returned it. ,Glass,cfowzys,1,t5_2r95f
923834,0,t3_24jpdl,well i think we all knew it didnt have top end specs so the estimate isnt really that surprising.what id like to see is someone create an alternate set of glass and squeeze into a slim glass form factor. non glass owners will flaunt the article. glass owners will argue it.,Glass,ch9an73,1,t5_2r95f
