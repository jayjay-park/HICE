8706525,0,t3_4y3rqp,Awesome article TY for posting I was already anxious for the game but two points in the article really spiked my interest even more Talking about how killing even the most insignificantseeming person will have repercussions on the London ecosystem.Also the part where you get to research and learn about potential victims. To learn clues and I guess decide if one person or another is worth killing?Sounds like theyre doing an excellent job making the game world interconnected and realistic.Also makes me think that the same kind of player that tried to run through Life is Strange without slowing down and taking the time to look everywhere and talk to everyone is going to have a very hard time in Vampyr.It sounds like its going to be an amazing game Im stoked!,Vampyr,d6ty86j,1,t5_36afi
