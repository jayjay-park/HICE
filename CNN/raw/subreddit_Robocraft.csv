1595287,0,t1_cjfo0fq,Heres the thing. When youre flying you have almost  options to being effective. Your plasma cannons are crazy inaccurate at extremely long range so what do you have to do? You have to get in to get in near  the width of the map to actually hit people at that range. So being that close SMGs can easily get you with  or  shots before they become too inaccurate. Let me give you a scenario. The box with  SMGs sees me I then have to flip sideways to turn away then guess what? I now put my broad side to them more area to hit more of my ass thats going to get chewed up. Then a wing gets hit and Im dead in the water crash into the ground and stay there the rest of the map. How about if I stay low and fly around the outside of the map above the rim? Every map that has that option available for you to hit the major lanes where people are fighting gives almost every other enemy ship a chance to shoot at you. As for evasive maneuvers you must either be bad at this game or stupid to think thats possible in here. You absolutely  cannot dodge someone with good aim whore using SMGs or railguns. Thats because theyre both hitscan weapons.Heres what hitscan means A projectile weapon which uses unmodified hitscan information to dictate whether or not it has hit its target is often called a hitscan weapon. Deploying the weapon calls the hitscan function and if an object is detected in the path of the projectile a hit is registered. Since the effect is immediate the projectiles effectively travel at infinite speed and have a linear or otherwise simple trajectorySince SMGs first shot unmoving and unmoving railgun shots are  accurate all they have to do is pretend its a point and click adventure and slaughter you. No chance for evasion since the projectiles have INFINITE speed. Unless the person is sitting back there spraying or you have barely peaked above the mountain and saw them before they saw you youre going to get hit,Robocraft,cjg97vx,1,t5_2ygr4

1729234,0,t3_2e8p6o,The simplest way I can think to explain is just like youd put wheels on bottom of your bot put the blades on top. If you have them too far down on your bot it will be top heavy and flip over and youll spend the match upside down. Also do your best to armour them as much or even more than your pilot seat. If you lose a vital blade you might as well just give up since youll be useless. Going along with that comment try to add extra blades in the same general area so that if you do happen to lose an important blade you can still hopefully fly around and be productive.Other than that youll just have to experiment with them. Figure out how they like to make your specific bot behave flip over weight placement etc. Good luck with your build!,Robocraft,cjx4v1f,3,t5_2ygr4

1854008,0,t3_2ftcif,I loved it until later tiers. Now its tedious to play and only the troll builds survive. Most of the people alive at the end are plasma bombers and rail campers. You cant build anything for fun. It has to be these certain designs or you get one shot killed. I played it every day for a while but its not fun anymore. Someone playing in the same tier as me shouldnt be able to kill me in one shot when Im  health. My design isnt THAT crappy. Ive looked at the build guides. Fliers can fly so high that you cant mark them or hit them consistently with anything but a rail gun. SMG fire wont hit them enough at that height to do anything but help them gauge their aim at you.

Im not saying there are no smart medics but I am saying there are a lot that dont really pay too much attention to what theyre doing.If I am playing with a good medic however I will do whatever I can to keep them alive. In fact one game a really good medic was keeping our outgunned team alive well until it came down to the last guy on the enemy teamwho was a bomber and we were starting to cap the last bar of the enemy base. The medic was unfortunately hit with a disabling volley and I really felt that he should share in the victory bonus so I preceded to hover over top of his husk with my bot. Unfortunately I was destroyed about  of way into the cap and the next volley finished him off.

If they take damage and being large and a single object they WILL take damage that damage will be transferred to the cubes they are attached to. Thats why a lowtier EP can be more dangerous than no EP at all its like a damage magnet and less cubes means less HP. So where theres space to use higher tier cubes use the cubes. Especially in your case youve just entered T with Real Monster and should be starting to replace blueyellow cubes with red cubes.Still if youve got the CPU to spare and secure placement then sure they have their places.I love the design of the Stinger in particular it looks like something I would design. Thats all the more reason I worry about it however. For survivability the pilot should be closer to the rear and the weapons closer to the front. Also T EPs arent going to take much punishment on T and although they look cool and protect your hover blades well Ts would be a lot safer in my mind. The Ts are fine so long as they arent connected directly to the pilot seat. I used them in a similar place to great effect back when my Lionfish hovertank was T.EDIT Realized Real Monster should be T.,Robocraft,clquila,6,t5_2ygr4

I go for guns first and try and dodge the first few shots and sometimes I get  easy kills and take almost no damage. it should be noted that with so few guns I lose in a v straight duel in close range vs. gunbeds and plasmas which is why I USUALLY try to stay at rangemy strategy against snipers is to keep up a barrage of bullets on them and move back and forth to keep them from being able to aim at the individual parts of my bot and to hopefully dodge a few snipers main thing is to stay out of rythym so they cant predict where you will bemy bots primary use is an aa gun though I tear through anything flying through the air and they dont stand a chance matches with  or  flyers suddently have  flyers about  seconds into the matchwhen I notice my team has less medics than enemies I lead a charge into the enemy while things are even and take down whoever I can since I am EXTREMELY heavily armored I can usually take down a medic or two and sometimes I can completely demolish the entire enemy team with a little help. My strength is ranged combat however so I only do that when I know we are losing a war of attritionso yes when flanking at close range or when in a close range duel I do indeed hold right click but part of the finesse of being an smg is knowing when to hold and when to send out short accurate bursts. there is lots of skill and strategy involved in smgs and if there wasnt I wouldnt be beating so many people so consistantlyI currently am running in t with only  armor blocks into t... when I get enough for my t medic Im going to keep my smg in t and then start playing as a medic for the last  tiers.the fact I end matches with multiple kills and usually in the top  on my team while BARELY being in tier shows that skill does make a differenceHope you enjoyed my strategic guide to being an smg Dtldr yes smgs are easy to play at an elementary level but so are all the different bot types more advanced smg strategies are quite fun and skilful however pps I saw your tag btw p but you asked me to teach you how so here is your guide D,Robocraft,cmvulk9,5,t5_2ygr4

2870523,0,t3_2szgxb,That was beautiful.  Ive been on both sides of that heh.  You have the teams where someone says GL HF and then your SMGs play bumper cars with each other while randomly firing.  As you move out to try to get to position you have some idiot with a plasma cannon shooting you announcing your presence with huge red flashes for the enemy to see.In contrast there are games in which everyone is silent and gets the damn job done.  Everyone is moving at once staying together aside from the aircraft and flankers.  Before your army even fully rolls out of the base youre getting spots from your highspeed fliers who have successfully scouted enough to point out where the enemy has split into groups and you know which group your army is going to intercept and kill first.I have a tier  interceptor I have fun with and so in those games I am one of the fast attack spotters.  If my team is quiet I can hear where the enemy is doing their own random firing.  It is rare that both teams are good or both teams are morons.

Only rails would be hard to use with the current way damage spreads other weapon users could still aim in the general direction of a vital part and take it out.and plasma players would have no trouble anywayThe controller is also superior on manuevering so there is also that.War thunder as I said is cross platform and has both plane and tank combat with high realism. Tank turret spin times allow me to aim wherever I want before my turret gets there and be as effective as a PC. Planeswell hard hitting slow firing ones do take a bit of a hit but you can still reliably hit your targets just not fine tune much.Robocraft would give a slight mobility advantage to any craft with wheels and or flight when using a controller since you would get to angle your rudders and use your thrusters not fully to better maneuver instead of having to tap the buttons.,Robocraft,cofzgg2,1,t5_2ygr4

But it does really nicely in keeping my wheels alive slightly longer! Plus its connected to a lot other points on the tank and the wheels them self.The worst thing that could happen to me is getting most my guns shot off or losing both tracks on a single side Or taking rearshots since it has the least armor and some important bits back there both only happen until ive slugged it out with  or more other players.This thing seems to never lose a good  on  except when a rail gunner climbs a cliff i cant reach.

I used to sit in the middle of the zerg and plink at whatever I could see or snipe flyers from across the map. It was easy. I had a lot of success. But it was boring.Now? Im zipping all over the map. Flanking enemies nailing medics and their patients in their back. Get in anyones face and destroy them v. I hunt down snipers. My playstyle changed drastically and Im enjoying it so much more with no less success but games are more hit or miss. Of course thats on me and could be done before too. But Im still thankful for the nudge it gave me.But not all is well. There are so much more flyers now and most matches are still lacking enough rails to properly counter them.

3155551,0,t3_2wajcy,Number  and  kinda contradict each other. Fair enough. Depends entirely on what builds youre facing. My lump of a medic will quite happily tank shots instead of a MegaSMG stick. If youre going allin then you should be hitting their glass cannons to drop their damage output which may be the medic anyway whereas if youre in an extended trade at a distance  then by all means plink the medic if hes silly enough to expose himself.  Depends on enemy placement and how well you can read a fight.  Sometimes breaking off and slipping around the back of the enemy blob can turn the battle around. Just make sure you have an escape route and dont just YOLO in. Also depends on the build  if you can get them to tunnel vision in on your tanky ass whole your team does naughty things to them  then thats just fantastic.  Eh killing people is fun yo.  Also you need to get all  cap segments for it to be worth the same as one kill or assist. Depends on where and what the guy is I guess.  You get the same for a kill or an assist so if youve done  damage or more  you can move on to the next poor sod without losing RP gains.,Robocraft,cop2k1i,2,t5_2ygr4
3155848,0,t3_2wajcy,Considering kills and assists give you the same reward the only advantage to actually getting the kill is the extra  CPU damage you will deal which isnt exactly worth it IMO.

Held off building one because I dont like megabots  they are slow and SMG screen vibration gives me cancer.I gave in after accruing  million RP and wanting a bigger garage. I decided on  wheels so if  get shot off you are still somewhat mobile.

3499002,0,t3_307nic,Id be happy with bogus patch notes.Fixed a bug that allowed SMG weapons to be placed on the sides of blocks.Fixed a bug where plasma weapons all fired at the same time. They now fire in sequence with the usual cooldown time between shots.The hitbox on walker legs was not representative of their size. Legs now cannot be placed within  blocks of another leg.We felt that rotors were too difficult to destroy. Armor rating on rotors has been halved at all tiers.Tesla blade damage has been doubled. Twice. We determined that they were not effective as a weapon type.The battle matching system has been changed to incorporate a minimum of three  scouts per team. Maybe now people will use the spotting system.The spotting system has been removed.Fixed an issue where SMG shots were being stopped by the environment. This was never intended.

3511248,0,t3_30hpxm,Agreed. In fact Id even go so far as to say theyre worse than T launchers. Theyre massively huge same armour and higher chance to lose damage cause of the second volley. And they also have a massive increase in CPU cost much more than the Mega SMG.,Robocraft,cpsi8b0,14,t5_2ygr4
3513666,0,t3_30hpxm,What Ive heard people say is that the second fire means it can rip through triforcing better since the damage is being spread out between multiple hits with allot of damage behind them.The megaSMG might do the same damage but it takes more hits to do so and the damage is more directed at one pointmaking it more effective at disabling robots. By having two big burst of damage the MegaLauncher can rip a hole in the outer armor and the second volley can hit the triforcing underneath finishing it off. This means shields will become more useful for blocking plasma damage while triforcing loses that strength and focuses on blocking SMG damage.,Robocraft,cpss7p3,1,t5_2ygr4

It doesnt happen often but it happens sometimes.  When you feel like youve done all you can while your team doesnt play like a team and continually gets its butt wooped over and over youre left alone as an immobile unit that cant get anywhere...For how this game generally goes punishing players for leaving a bad match would be absolutely terrible. Punished for leaving games where teamates troll megabots despite being asked not to. Teams that split up to every corner on the face of the earth despite you being the only medic and being unable to get around to keep them all safe and being blamed for the inability for keeping them that way. I dont do it often and when I do self destruct I generally do it because I just dont feel like putting up with the frustration of whatevers really biting on my nerves.  I still try and suck it up and let people have their kills.

3678568,0,t1_cqbivn6,They arent just bending over and giving the players what they wanted either though. Theres a fair amount of deliberation and points going back and fourth. They are testing these things as they progress and players may make some way out predictions but they might actually hold water and somewhat reflect a bit in the testing yes? At the end of the day they need a game that can keep customers around. Keep the people happy... Find the best middle ground solution they can that most can settle down with. Its a balancing act of listening to community feedback and knowing when to stick to your guns for the sake of it. Stick to your guns too much and you risk becoming blind to the faults in your art and craft and never improve.Too much wavering and it becomes a mess forever stuck in planning as you said.The team is doing fine right now... They might need to scrap earlier works but its in the name of making something stronger.  Most of these ideas sound like they still Cary the original thoughts on these upcoming changes from before. Hovers are still getting hit somewhat but will not be hindered by the size of the build anymore which is nice given how much artbots hinged on hovers.  Finding a zone where both devs and players can agree is the sign of good development. To make themselves happy whilst retaining most of the interest the fanbase has.There will always be someone who leaves due to change. Due to things not working like they once did... But controlling that amount is the most important. This is a rework of robocraft not a completely new game. Its taking many of robocraft simpler concepts and expanding on them a great deal and thus they need to add more depth to match this new lengthy gameplay. It still needs to have the familiarity of the old game whilst enhancing it. And right now the developers and players need to work hand in hand. While the players may simplify and lack the understanding of this cycle the devs can get a glimpse into what it is the players are looking for. What it is that bothers them.... Neither side can continue on without the other. Without the game the customers have nothing to play without the players the devs have no funding to work on their game.  And for a competitive multiplayer game with the concepts that robocraft brings to the table it has a fair amount of potential. Hell Id say the games pritty danm fantastic as it is now.But what good is it to simply invest your time and effort into a whole new game mode you made that monumentally changes up the game and a grand majority of your fanbase simply dislikes it. Getting the confusion and OMG NO THIS CHANGE IS SHIIIIIT out before it becomes permenant and involves a complete rework. Imagine if the devs had stuck to their guns that they were to make this game mode and were to never agree on keeping the old game modes... They dont have a fallback they dont have anyone anymore... Or at the very least operating on fumes. With what they have now currently in progress they have the old gamemode to appease the current audiance... They are working on balances that will be beneficial to current and old.. Balancing on overclocking and without it. For those short on time playing the old game mode Im guessing that those ones speaking up were the whales so to speak. The ones spending the cash the ones purchasing galaxy credits given the lack of time they have to vest in the game and make up for it through IRL cash to get the most out of the experience.  The customers that spend the most gone. Poof. No more time to invest in robocraft due to thirty minute games. Part of game development is guessing predicting and assuming what will happen. Assume how players will react and use what they have available. Do you honestly think anyone foresaw minecrafts spawning mechanics abused to the point where it eventually became something that became a huge backbone in the games success?I very much doubt it and it was the playerbase that made that happen. That understood how certian mechanics worked picking them apart and examining them. For every ten players making a repost or talking about some issue that never exists there will always be one player smart as a whip finding every flaw every nook and cranny they can to abuse break and point out the flaw in your system. ,Robocraft,cqbkxem,3,t5_2ygr4

Most games I overclock the fastest and just force any flying unit to sit in their shield or be shredded alive by my rails. Recently I have been playing as an SMG copter and rails just eat me alive. They shoot off my rotor blades and I go spiraling out of control. I have also seen bombers getting killed from across the map barely in render distance. Hell I have done it before myself as a railer. I think rails are fine now because at higher overclock levels  shots is probably enough to kill unless you keep moving or have a medic behind you. With that and the fusion shield heal buff its just gonna be one big turtle war with rails hitting everyone from across the map and anyone who dares go for a tower will just die once they step into a railers range. ,Robocraft,cr1hhg0,1,t5_2ygr4

3960767,0,t1_cr7m7h4,Youre entire response was basically deal with it Im sorry but that simply is not argument. It clearly shows that you understand that these are the problems well face all of which are unfriendly and will create toxicity in the community. These changes are supposed to fix current problems and no create a plethora of new ones.gt Then you loose plain and simple.Ok? but right now I wont simply lose its not as black and white as that. Its a little bit more diverse and a little more challenging. As Ive said you can still win v but with this idea you can lose v with just one team member having a bad bot.gt  Its impossible to account for every single bad decision a player makes just to troll a game.Yes I understand but right now thats not an issue. Right now one bad player doesnt mean the end of the match. With this system in place it will be. This isnt a problem now and I see no reason why I should accept this problem and deal with it is not a defence. Especially if it means that I can have a fun time being dominating with a team of  really good players and  bad player Vs  good players.gt Like this isnt the case already? A bad bot is simply something we shouldnt be seeing in T.Again there is no defence against my argument and this system will only increase an already hostile environment. People cant make innovationsnew designsbetter bots if there is no breathing room for it. The Pit will slightly fix this but the real test will always be in the field. Right now it seems fairly decent. Again you can win with a shitty bot on your team as it stands. Everyone makes designs that end up not working as planned its literately part of the game.  I just won a  minute game where we carried a bad a plasma and had no air support. With this system that would be  minutes down the drain but instead we worked together as a team and overcame this complication fairly easily. Like a proper team we banded together and won instead of some skewered system to  make bad bots have more of a cripple on a team then they already are. Bad bots will always be around and while T is end game its not a proper competitive circuit.gt Im so tired of teamates that cant back me up in a fight as air support... OH LOOK AT ALL THE SMGS SHOOTING AT ME BECAUSE NONE OF MY GROUND UNITS CAN SURVIVE A SINGLE FUCKING HIT.This idea wont help that much if at all. In theory there should be less bad bots in T but it also forces players to play defencively and most likely in lemmings packs again.  I like to be tanky and take intuitive in those situations right now but if my death will hurt my team a lot I will take that into account. If I see two bots attacking a flyer I wont charge in blindly like I do now. As soon as flyers get hit they are already working on an escape strategy so most of the time I wont get support from them. So in this situation if its just one bot attack a flyer that is fine but as soon as its two Im not going to run out and be reckless. I may ping them a little but as soon as I get there attention Im leaving as well and if I see the flyer is going to die anyway there is no sense in trying to defend. The smarter play will usually be to avoid confrontation until I have team members with me to deal with the threat.In the end Im going to be more cautious and avoid fights I cant win instead of trying to do as much damage as I can and hopefully help a little. Again if its v situations is anyones game but v will be a waste of a respawn. If a flyer is caught in a bad spot there is no reason to waste two respawns. gt Im tired of thirty minute struggles of futilitysThats fine I hate those long matches to that just drive on and on and on. There is a problem where it seems the entire match is nothing more than waiting for that  minutes to kick in. This is a problem but I dont think the solution should be for a team to lose faster. Even the Devs wish to have a  minute game weather you lose or win. If anything the better solution would be more team coordination. Right after curse voice popped up you can tell when a team is actively using it and it completely sucks when youre on the other side of the coin. gt Its a game loosing happens build a bridge and get over it.. Bots will dieOf course but again as it stands this isnt a big problem but in this new system it will be. Im not saying this system will not work but what I am saying is at the moment it wont. Big changes would have to be made in order for it to work more than just a winning or losing a game faster. The developers are going to balance it around their ideals and one of them is match time.Those  minute matches is somewhat the developers goal. Theyve mentioned over and over about they want the mode to be around  minutes. While theyve changed their mind in the past its only reasonable to count their goals into the equation as well. gt gt Its a game loosing happens build a bridge and get over it.. Bots will die it will have to happen eventually. You dont win by sniveling in a corner worrying about wasting resources and you dont do well just throwing yourself into shit situations and contributing nothing to a match. If team members make poor decisions you loose as a team. Now with all that said I can use your exact words and why not just build a bridge and get over it? This applies at the moment. While baserushing is a thing its nothing against a good team. This fix will diminish any hope of a pug team with a slight cripple being able to pull through. Instead of simply trying to make teams win or lose faster I think it would be better to find a solution that makes the games generally more fun to play even if you are losing. ,Robocraft,cr7reht,1,t5_2ygr4
3965631,0,t1_cr8ajkf,plasma is no where near weak lol its just balanced for the new meta. A lot of people complaining about plasma because of the old plasma paradigm which is Plasma either kill you first or they will kill you. This was changed by the new meta. Plasma in its base state is utterly garbage probably weaker than nano right now so they sucks pretty hard in classic. But once you rack up the overclock the reload gets pretty insane and you start tearing people apart like butter.  So basically rail have shifted into the kill them first before they kill you role and plasma shifted into take as many dump at the enemy as possible role.  Needless to say I feel like ground plasma kinda suboptimal right now cuz a tanky smg close its gap and youre dead. I have tore my fair share of ground plasma bot myself.   ,Robocraft,cr8bdlv,0,t5_2ygr4

Also more weight might make the mega blade work better. I heard that it scales up lift with increased weight...and this bot could certainly use extra mobility.

4105574,0,t3_37mggu,For me this is the only way mega plasmas will ever be a viable weapon. Considering a few volleys will miss because the shots spread out and the fact that plasmas are not hitscan and do not travel in a straight line means it takes a little skill to aim and hit your target. Only  guns firing is simply not enough damage. Hell  mega plasmas point blank will not even kill a well made somewhat tanky bot. And with  mega plasma youre going to have a wire frame mega with the pilot seat area easily identifiable. Also most practically built and partially tanky megas will have maybe  to  guns at most. Freejam if youre reading this please leave mega plasmas as they are now. Its the only way that they can be practically used in battle.

4324700,0,t3_3af3oq,Has everyone at FJ forgotten that they caused the trend towards gunbeds with the antigunbrella code and later barrier protectionresistivity?The theory went by causing incoming damage to guns from plasma and rail to transmit a large percentage of damage straight to the guns base block the guns relatively high amount of HP is mitigated where previously the huge hitbox of guns which we still have! would cause them to absorb a lot of damage rather than the body of the vehicle taking damage.For some numbers the current xmittance values for rail damage is  and  for plasma damage. In other words a T plasma with .k base damage can instagib any gun even with a t block as its base. Used to be readily observed in boss battles.So the anti gunbed produced the exact opposite effect  pro gunbed encouraging them further because the only way to maintain functionality under fire was by  you guessed it  more guns!  Theres no apparent indication that anyone at FJ realizes it to be part of the problem.This isnt to say that the gunbrella effect did not need dealing with but instead of doing something reasonable  such as reducing the hitbox for guns  Mark went off halfcocked with a halfbaked solution just as hes getting ready to do now.

Even if it were relevant I would only feel it necessary to doubt someones claim if it were noteworthy in the first place.  hours in Robocraft is not special...ltltBack on topic...I dont like megabots at all. In fact despite having over  million RP in the bank I still havent even bothered to make my own megabot. You cant platoon with them which makes using a megabot less fun since you cant take advantage of the social aspect of the game that makes it fun. And the presence of megabots in battle leads to games that are basically ball vs. ball type of battles. Everyone follows the megabot and the red team and blue team face off in one huge battle somewhere on the map all at once. Theres less opportunities for those smaller skirmishes where youre trying to gain an advantage by going  vs  or  vs  or something.The other issue with megabots is that there arent enough strict entry requirements to be a megabot. You get matches where some clown decided that T white armor and  TX mega SMGs was more than enough. Having so much power placed in the hands of one random individual can really hurt a team if that one person is atrocious. ,Robocraft,csd9ipj,0,t5_2ygr4

I use this for smaller bots mostly that cant tank shots by HP alone.The other method sues a central core of blocks that zigzag thier way towards the outside to maximise the amount of HP it takes to get tho the seat mainly. Then most of the central section of the bot surrounds the seat withoiut being connected to it. Finally some sort of damage routing using the shell of the bot itself to move damage around the bot as desired or using aero rods to link  bulky sections together. With the aero rods the damage kind of leaps to a different section of the bot before it can do critical damage to a single area.This is a pretty simple example of a bot built in  seperate parts both functioning well on thier own. Here is a simple example of using the aero rods to move damage around the bot. It has some routing damage bottom to top and from back to the front. Its not the best example but its easy to see as its on the outside of the bot.  or  direct hit rail shots to the back can be diverted to the bulky front section before the wings and pilot are in much danger. ,Robocraft,csyjmb5,2,t5_2ygr4
4507824,0,t1_csyutq9,yes that is true. But we listened to the community and kept it. We would like to get more new users to play it now  as there arent enough  so was asking for ideas. We will be making the Classic and Battle buttons the same size so new users are more likely to click it. And were thinking of renaming it so that new users tried it more often like Team Deathmatch all to get more new users to play it. At the moment x as many users play the Battle Mode to Classic so we thought these may help the improve numbers in Classic?,Robocraft,csyv089,11,t5_2ygr4

4852115,0,t3_3hcept,uAnormalcat suggested that Tsticks are super easy build. Describing the process as Thrusters in ALL directions  Naturally I took this as a challenge. Since no tier was specified I bought  of each tier of thruster and started with the biggest thrusters working my way down.  I pretty much spammed the thrusters occasionally rotating. But I did cheat slightly in that all the vertical thrusters are in the front half of the craft.  I soon realised something I already knew. Rudderless t sticks are incredibly unstable. So I picked up whatever rudders and Aerofoils I had sitting in my inventory and placed them in both orientations.  Turns out flat horizontal back mounted wings can stabilise the turning of even the most uneven of crafts.  I even managed to fit  SMGs    Now for the real question... Does it fly?  The answer is yes. With  wings stabilising it. Yes it flies.    HOWEVER flight is not the only thing that makes a thruster stick a thruster stick. It needs to be OP in battle and while I didnt go into battle for fear my laptop would melt. I can safely say that this craft would not survive too long its manaeuverability is incredibly sluggish it uses many thrusters far lower than T and the SMGs are badly placed. ,Robocraft,cu658kh,2,t5_2ygr4

5233264,0,t1_cvgrjht,gt Thats my point? The extra guns are handles you might not notice them.Yeah Im gonna notice them since they are  of your firepower. I will also notice them since they contradict being a gun bed. That was the whole argument.gt No. But if you have roses covering a bed and there are a few on the side does this suddenly alter the bed of roses in to a normal mattress of roses? Thats weird.They cannot stay on the side. My cheap satin sheets are clean enough for gravity to make the roses fall down the sides if they leave the top. I know this from first hand experience. Show me some side mounted roses. Dgt Like are you saying that while laying on your bed your hand has never been on the side?Yes this is what Im saying. Are you saying you cling to the sides of your bed while sleeping? Are you sleeping on an a child sized air mattress or something? If I would roll so my hand is outside the bed it is outside the bed not side mounted. If I leave the top side of my bed I am damn sure I wont stick to the side of the bed thats not how beds work with our gravity.gt I havent even seen your bot yetThis all started because you looked at my bot and said Not really a gun bed. Just a plain old SMG hover. The  side mounted SMGs prove my point.No you are taking this out of context again because you dont what I was referring too. I will paste it again for youYOU My SMG HoverGunbed has  SMG on topfront.ME Yeah thats shitty bot. Enjoy getting your guns shut off unless you have some really cool design to keep them alive. Rods sure as hell wont save you.YOU Now youre just being a dick. ME A bot with a single caterpillar track would also be shitty. Its just facts I havent even seen your bot yet so how could you take it personal? But you are right my way of discussing can certainly be called being a dick.YOU This all started because you looked at my bot and said Not really a gun bed. Just a plain old SMG hover. The  side mounted SMGs prove my point.Can you follow this? I said I havent seen your  SMG hover. I still havent.gt Which sparked my confusion in what constitutes as a Gunbed. You start by saying its an okay build then moved to say it was shitty. Which is why it seemed like a personal attack?Is this a personal attack for you? Both of us anonymous arguing about how to build robots in a game? Dont go playing the victim you coward. It adds nothing.gt Turning in a snakelike motion can help you keep your weapons alive. As noted above this is personal. I did not say i was a legend and your DPS isnt taking that large of a hit. if you do hit the right momentum you can somewhat time what you are trying to do.If your weapons cant be shot by the enemy they are very unlikely to be able to shoot the enemy and that is clearly the point of weapons especially SMGs! I have taken a long look at your bot and I will with  certainty say that your top side mounted guns will fire first then some of the top mounted then the bottom  side mounted. That means you have to wiggle back and forth  times during one  shot volley to not have shots firing to the sides like a disco laser. I wanna see that wiggle.gt You are using rods for damage mitigation but they have less hp than cubes. You are using them in the bot this whole thread is about. I think its relevant.No Im not? Now Im even more confused. I never even mentioned AeroRods.I have literally  aerorod on here and its for the pilot seat.This is my bad sorry. I mixed the discussions up. I was arguing against these rods  in this thread I need to start writing one reply at a time.gt Why is it so surprising that other people have different experiences?We are playing the same game we are facing the same problems and we have access to the same solutions. I am baffled how some people solve these problems. Like trying to defend themselves from having people under you in the pit. Instead of pressing shift you arrange your guns to shoot them downwards when they highly likely have a real gun bed with perfect clearance if that happened. Please show me the bottom of your hover and see what happens. D,Robocraft,cvgsrhn,1,t5_2ygr4

5497408,0,t3_3qdu63,Currently G.I got through bronze with my zippy  msmg hover. Its a risky choice but against poor players it wins games fast and makes for a short stay in bronze. Once decently through silver i switched to the GrapeDigger a super rugged gunship. Its much more useful for handling air which I started encountering more of and could boast the same repositionability at my hover. If you want to carry you have to do a ton of soloengaging so a hybrid armorEP bot gives you the extra armorcpu to win vs and survive under heals.Platoon. Win rate goes through the roof like . At least one of us was a medic. The rd played medic or a rental of my msmg bot. One medic needs to travel at moderate speeds to be able to escape death or get back into battle after it. The other medic can be slow and tanky ensuring the front line never falls. Alternatively the ground msmg works around the front line flanking targeting air whatever isnt being done. The copter secures objectives far away from the front line like taking down incoming bombers thwarting backdoors defending towers or stealing them when unattended. The copter should also show up to stalemated team fights to tip the scales. There are other good combos for a platoon but its most important that between any two members any task can be dealt with. Tasks can include rapid repositioning antiair tower capture team fighting out of heals team fighting under heals v stalling battles etc.. When playing alone your bot needs to be able to do all of these things well.Also dont rent my MSMG hover its built specifically for how I like to control my bots the piece of crap has rudders.A few things that are crap for the solo queuerTeslas relies on enemies not paying attention or another attentive healer. Too much luck.Ground Plasma you cant handle air units you want to minimize reliance on the team. Rails too much of a support role to directly influence the tide unless playing against enemies made of wet paper.Heals cant deal with air alone or any other bot for that matter. Dont rely on match making to give you teammates that press left mouse button. Anything slow cant carry the team from the back lines! Youre needed all across the map be there.Anything that cant always survive a plasma or rail salvo.

5557811,0,t3_3r8lss,If one would illustrate the direction changes in which Robocraft was supposed to go wed need a spiral.Freedom buildingampfighting game? This seems like a MOBA. Oh wait maybe competetive game would be better. Or no lets go with freedom building gameampfighting game anyway.This begs for yelling get your shit together. And the first concept of free game was simply best because in this everyone can find something for themselves and no direction changes needs to be done because it all can be connected. I doubt that Robocraft will ever find its place on competetive or MOBA scene.I dont get why the heck they force us to play only the gamemodes they want on robot ranked at level they want. Or why suddenly all Battle Mode fights are ranked. As a person who uses Battle mode only to clear first win Im forced to be some bronze even if I dont give a fuck about any sort of rankings and shiz like this. Theres no place to be creative in it.Old Robocraft didnt had any of these things every gamemode was free to every robot everyone could choose when they play ranked pretty much this didnt gave anything. And that was perfect for me.Id like to see a gamemode that can give players RP but without fighting. Like the mentioned racing. Or something like you can experience on Minecraft minigames fighting the build battle mode where players showcase their builds and get rated by community which gives them points and currency. This is true freedom.

Removing the seat means you no longer have a core that needs to be protected nor the ability to gut a vulnerable opponents and that you will die regardless of how capable the remaining  of your bot may have been designed to be.  Regeneration means redundancy part protection and the ability to retain function while taking damage are far less important as is the ability to disable bots in general.  Mech legs are massive damagesoak bricks that cant be built around can only be somewhat tweaked by hovers and... walker legs? and function absurdly well no matter how few there are or where they are or whats placed upon them.  Soon rails are going to penetrate through blocks which is blatantly antibuilding and theres murmers of explosions doing similar with actual AOE damage and missile drilling was intended have similar results.  And its impossible to forget chapter  when we somehow narrowly averted having every bot replaced by a computergenerated parade balloon.

And the nature of it is brutal for the flyer that have nowhere to go so I understand the frustration specially if youve got used to flying an untouchable bomber back when they dominated with tesseracts being the pinnacle.But I really dont think it is that bad. In a game where there arent many fliers but mostly smg cruisers and the like a flying flak copter is pretty useless and is easily shot down and cant hold a siege. Being able to hunt someone down happens maybe  in  at most most of the time if you try you die. the enemy have flak tooI feel strong AA adds more then it takes away and I feel we see more variation in viable bot builds now then we did before.

7092030,0,t1_d1jdfmx,And the continuing problem will be that developers that have this mindset will never really be done with a game like this. Its been changing for years and will continue to change usually until something horrible happens like the game becomes unplayable or the company has a huge financial setback and goes under.A year from now the game will most likely barely resemble what it is now and all traces of what it was will be gone. A year later... who knows if it will even be around but it will probably be even more different. Like I said in my OP Ive seen this before. Its unfortunate but it happens. They had a solid concept and a great game. It wasnt entirely original but it was executed so well that they might as well have come up with it. But rather than polish the concept and run with what worked they went from free combat to some sort of Moba hybrid crap and now they are talking about League of Legends also a Moba but also really really complex and frigging Hearthstone... a card game. Admittedly a fun card game but a card game nonetheless. They are trying to morph a robot crafting combat game into the same asset earning system as a card game. Its completely jumped the shark at this point. Best of luck to them. Im sure they have a vision and criticism like this will just make them solidify their resolve to go on with their plans. As Im generally on the side of all game companies I hope they pull it off. I doubt they will though. ,Robocraft,d1k90uv,3,t5_2ygr4

Also platoons with voice communication will very likely decide this as well. I hate to say this but it is teamwork.

They DO take more shots to knock off if theyre attached directly to mech legs due to either Barrier Protection or Resistivity depending on what type of weapons youre shooting with. Because the mech legs have so much health they can absorb the damage that passes through the Barrier Protection or Resistivity of the rails youre targeting without being destroyed themselves and thus the rail survives.When rails are placed on armor cubes rather than mech legs they get destroyed with fewer hits because the armor cubes cant absorb  or  assuming these stats that are no longer on tooltips are still accurate of the damage youre putting on the rails that passes directly through.,Robocraft,d2kd4ms,1,t5_2ygr4

7453718,0,t1_d2pfpnj,Overclocking is automatic. Its the number next to players names. Your overclocking level is displayed in the lower left corner. It grows with healing causing damage destroying protonium. If you team holds the majority of towers it will constantly rise for your whole team.So theres a strong incentive to hold at least  towers because itll make your team stronger over time. If you capture all three towers the shield around the enemy base will collapse and it will be much easier to attack it. The shield is feared more than it should be. Many players dont dare to attack the base as long as its up  which is a shame because most of the time the base is unguarded while everyone is at the front trying to make points.So yeah for every useful contribution to the common goal of your team your bot will earn overclocking points and with every higher overclocking level your bot will perform better.,Robocraft,d2pfv4y,3,t5_2ygr4

Putting even  low level rail on your boot really helps to take out planes and helicopters. Aim for the connection points on towers and the reactor the towers have little tabs that stick out and connect with the crystals only on two points break the crystals that touch the tabs on both sides and the rest will fall off. Use the Q button when scoped in on an enemy to have their name tag show up through walls for a short time. As a medic try to find the iteration who has done the most dangerous on your team and follow them around. As a sniper spam the Q button on everyone all the time. With plasmas they most effective from the air since you dont have to think about how the shots fall. With smgs make sure you bring lots of guns and dont go alone unless you are guaranteed to take a tower. Use ctrlampclick to ping objectives to make people know what you have in mind.

Personally I think when antigunbrella dies triforcing will be much more important and powerful especially when defending external component mounts. Without antigunbrella the only way you would randomly lose component left is damage radiating through the shell into your gun mount. If you can prevent that from happening your guns will be far more resilient.

Had platclan reports where theyve watched someone go invisible while still shooting and with nametag showing without blinking though so Im not sure theyre directly related.As far as blink in general goes Ive seen all the described symptoms and will add that if I blink while dying sometimes itll actually animate sideways like in an L shape veering  degrees in a random direction halfway through the jump and I splode at the end of the blink.That brings up another blink bug that I dont think is new. Maybe its not a bug it could be intentional but seems to relate to the bugs. How am I exploding upon destination of a blink assuming Im only even visible to an enemy before blinking? Is it carrying a death I incurred through the blink? Is it landing a lagged hit late and counting it midwarp? Whats going on there? I kind of think I shouldnt be dying midblink in any way in the first place though which if implemented may avoid some of these blinkdeath bugs altogether. Also will add that blinkinganddying can also seemingly cause the cooldown icon and even other icons to turn red despite still being present andor charging up. It can cause them to freeze so it shows cooled down and ready full power bar but wont fire. So its like I DID hit the blink before dying because its cooling down but its showing me its full and ready or destroyed and affecting other module icons similarly. It can do a bunch of really odd stuff. Blinking again after the respawn regardless of the symptom seems to fix it though. So Im just sparkly however long it takes to cool down or if it even lets me know its IN cooldown. ,Robocraft,d7emi7s,1,t5_2ygr4

Of course tweaking will still need to be done after that but seeing as weapon balance is as good as it is I remain optimistic about the future of movement balance.,Robocraft,d8r9nv9,6,t5_2ygr4

Im just saying that Ive asked clanmates about why people go on about how great things were before crates and they admitted that it was just as if not more grindy than crates at their worst. Its just that the grind was fun for them.My main beef with the old implementation of RP conceptually has to do with how to take it out of circulation so that you can have a reduction in loss or increase in gain w premium which corresponds both to poor newbies and rich veterans. If you have it be based on repair costs then that ruins bot variety. That works for most games because the only concern is making people more competitive but its different in RC.

10521809,0,t1_dd0oc3q,There are no tricks in building except placing flak at top plasma at bottom common sense stuff but if you skim the edges of the terrain groundcliffcraterbuildingwhatever youll get solid accuracy while at that precariously low height. Not a lot do it though because one attacking and trying not to crash to the ground is hard and two any decent player would just bomb the hell out of you as a result. I heard some people used hovers for hybrid builds but they cause drag that slows planes down so theres that.The thing here is that flying flak will always try and cut close to you. They wont get on your nose but theyll cruise along a close distance while pinging you. Depending on their build theyll either attack you from the bottom or top. At that rate even the wide cone doesnt matter. All it needs is to get a few shots out at you and let the stacks do its thing.Basically when youre going as a flak flyer dont expect to get people from far away you REALLY have to get close to really devastate a bot or two. You could scare a few people off by lobbing flak at their direction but decent players would shake it off. Youll get a few good kills if you choose your target A plane busy lobbing plasma on your ground units an LOML chopper just done releasing a full payload maybe even one headed your direction but hasnt seen you yet. Unless the player is fairly new or has no way of defending itself in the air youre going to rely a lot on surprising the enemy. Those few seconds of bewilderment and shock following their screen basically exploding with giant blasts from seemingly nowhere will buy you time to deal substantial damage before they pinpoint you and hopefully when that happens theyll already be crashing down to the ground. Just be careful of any flyer with SMGs them attacking your flak isnt a good time.,Robocraft,dd0rea0,1,t5_2ygr4
10524239,0,t3_5qnms3, man drone platoons are only best for pubstomping. A mix of  drones and  good railers is best. In a v Id go with  drones  rails and a tower capper with lasers as well as AA as a secondary. If using AA as a secondary Id go with a blink sprinter with wasps and x small Flak cannons for arms. Let the drones bomb any ground rails keep air and ground suppressed while the capper moves on with wasps for capping. Flak arms would help out against heavy bombers that rails have trouble downing easily. With wasps and small Flak the capper could probably rock a DSM for cover while capping too  being quite energy efficient with its weapons.That said I may be posting a video soon where I found myself flying a low CPU plasma copter against a team of flak and rail equipped Platoon mates. Most of my team was air. We still won though it was a hell of a fight. Air being able to hit towers and disappear until its clear for another hit and run lends to air dominance n BA currently. If it were more of a Koth mode with a reactor to destroy it may give ground better standing. Unfortunately that also makes ground an easy target for bombers as they have to sit in one area to cap. I suppose its like that already at least now they dont have to be distracted by shooting crystals.,Robocraft,dd11bwg,3,t5_2ygr4

Flak was the only thing that challenged either of them.,Robocraft,delr831,1,t5_2ygr4
11079668,0,t3_5y7tkc,Never ever use EPs on a bot instead of cubes as a replacement UNLESS you understand why you are using them.  EPs shields separate from their health have a recharge time which cant be healed.EPs are attached to one cube except some EpicsEPs provide less HP Value per CPU expended the larger you useetc...So why use EPs?  Weight and size restrictions is usually the st reason. Rail Gun protection is usually the nd takes more than  shot to take off a EP. Some bots that are fast moving have used EP spam and its unique properties to make very tough smaller bots some famous EP drones out there.There are more reasons for and against but as a general rule spamming EPs are not optimal on a bot and its better to use them to solve a specific problem or simply as a cosmetic alternative to cubes.And it feels to me the new patch has nerfed EPs especially the shield on mech legs,Robocraft,denvccs,6,t5_2ygr4
