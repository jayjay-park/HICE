464462,0,t3_1zerd3,I could see there being trouble getting new US astronauts up to the ISS. But there is no way that the Russian government would or even could stop astronauts from returning on Soyuz. Im quite sure that even if the Russian government ordered the cosmonauts to stop astronauts from returning the cosmonauts would tell them to fuck off and bring the astronauts back anyway. Nearly every person who has ever gone to space comes back thinking not about their county but about the world. This happened even at the height of the cold war. For examplegt Orbiting Earth in the spaceship I saw how beautiful our planet is. People let us preserve and increase this beauty not destroy it!

464803,0,t3_1zf08s,While reading through the wiki page for the space shuttle. It mentions that the Johnson Space Centers Mission Control Center would take control after the shuttle clears the tower. While that doesnt answer the question specifically the article does talk about the shuttles gimbling engines. While I have no proof I would imagine the engines SRBs and Mains would overpower the small control surfaces and thus I would believe the engines would be used. I have no proof of this just something I thought I remembered.TIL that the shuttles nose would pitch  meters from the thrust of the main engines seconds before launch.EDIT Found the info! Orbiter Vehicle section has a line about using the main engines as the controls during launch and the control surfaces during descent and landing.

5573457,0,t1_cwnvv77,Yeah but like its all relative right? Time stopping is only your perception or ability to percept time stopping or at best entering a state of physics different to our own like a post light speed quantum physics? Perhaps you can actually move faster than your own perception how would we know? While I do not at all think you are wrong I like to ponder. Is the mere constraining of space and time to two spatial coordinates part of the problem? Doesnt your x axis assume that light speed is instantaneous? Or at least that perception or measurement of it is?It might be a theoretical implication that it is impossible but what I was saying is that what if the practical application tells us something different...wouldnt be the first time experiments exposed problems with our theories. But it is clearly obvious that from an outside perspective you could track an object moving faster than light if you could see it like if you saw a light source move from Mars to Alpha Centauri in a few minutes. Is that truly impossible? You could say it is theoretically impossible but the fact is a set of light particleswaves could arrive at Earth depicting those events what then?

Yeah I like Star Wars I am too mainstream hipsters are gonna kill meFrom space exploration I liked the apollo  logo like here but I saw a different one this one has just the logo on it the one I saw had the figure  slanted to the side and drawn in a perspective. Also it wasnt framed by the triangle shape.From minimalist tshirt designs there was a series of tshirt prints that used names of scientists but they were written in a way that implied their achievement. Like Newton was written with a red o that fell to the ground I cant find the pictures anywhere but I think there was Kepler and Galileo there with space related stuff.This one here is not really a picture but just form of a background.

Though with some googling of their signatures I can say that Neils looks to be fairly genuine and the closest I could find to Edwin Aldrin looks to have been written on a piece of card but looks identical. There is a VERY good chance that these were part of the collection of signed autographs meant to be released to families if the mission wasnt successful. They would have signed a few hundred of them before going out to space. Which is why they arent signed Buzz Aldrin when he later changed his name. Possibly making it worth a bit more.

You couldnt do so on a flat earth. Then there is the star constellations. It varies from north to south. You can see more of tall buildings the higher you are. Because of the earths curve you cannot see a building when you are at a distance but when you are moving upwards or away from the earth you can start to see the top.If the earth was flat and he believes the sun is a spotlight then you would be able to see the light from the sun either the sun rays or the light at other objects.

11285136,0,t3_60x577,Slight nitpick the Falcon family has a completely different payload range than SLS. Falcon  can do t to Trans Mars Injection t for Falcon Heavy. SLS as it will exist for the first crewed flight will be capable of t and evolvable to t. Not saying there isnt a place in spaceflight for those vehicles but theyre not a dropin replacement for SLS. SpaceX and NASA do combine efforts on many things. Key features of the Merlin engine are derived from a NASA program. NASA is providing advice and communicationstracking services for Red Dragon. SpaceX is sharing its retropropulsion data with NASA. And of course theres commercial crewcargo. The big debate in the space industry is if NASA should be in the business of designing and developing a heavy lift rocket at all and its Congress that has the final word.,nasa,dfb5jdu,2,t5_2qk6m
11305509,0,t3_61cev0,Short answer yes long answer yesish. There have been a few standards and versions of those standards that are compatible with each other and some there are malefemale versions and androgynous versions. The Wikipedia article has the whole list. I think the international docking standard is finally clearing it all up but Im not sure. The ISS has all sorts of adapters and stuff and Russian and US sides have different ports. And I dont actually know what the Chinese are using Im pretty sure they went ahead and made their own possibly? as a slight middle finger to the US for refusing to include them.,nasa,dfdgnrw,4,t5_2qk6m
11323513,0,t1_dffh0l4,Sameish thing. At the time these were being built it was still unclear how their station plans would proceed. Several of the design concepts involved building it off of the existing Mir base then discarding those modules as they became unnecessaryunusable. There was also talk of keeping Mir entirely and just adding new permanent modules. The Americans went through a similar process after Freedom gained Russian involvement original plan there was also to build off from Mir then discard the old modules,nasa,dffi2cq,11,t5_2qk6m

11676847,0,t1_dgje897,Youre totally right! The entire vehicle is green its just the cryogenic oxygen that creates ice on the outside. The Soyuz burns RP and LOX. RP is a type of kerosene which is liquid at room temperature. In pics like this you can see exactly where the O tanks end and the RP tanks begin. Theres a great gif Ive spent the past twenty minutes looking for where you can see the ice begin to condense as they begin fueling. Hopefully someone else can find it ,nasa,dgjl57q,4,t5_2qk6m
