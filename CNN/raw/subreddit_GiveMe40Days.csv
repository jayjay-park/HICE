1611089,0,t3_2ce62k,Day Today I also wrote  scenes! It was a lot better day I had a ton more energy despite a harder work day. I realized while running today that I really appreciate this challenge because its forced me to do stuff despite not having a ton of energy for extra activities. Instead of sitting and watching Netflix Ive chosen to create and practice instead.Good day overall. ,GiveMe40Days,cji8twr,2,t5_2skxv

4832487,0,t3_3fivow,Day fourteen  August thI went to group today. We decided we will probably keep me like two more weeks so that I can ensure progress continues and such. I felt really spacey during group today though. I dont know why. I took my Adderall and everything but I was still on a super space odessy.I finally got my student ID number from one of the community colleges so I could register for classes only to discover they dont have pole dancing or belly.dancing this term. This saddens me.... Plus side they have life drawing. Hopefully its not full.Girlfriend still isnt speaking to me. Boyfriend told me to give her space and see if she comes to me when she cools down.I am a bit too focused on the others right now. I feel like I have to fix things with them and cant really and doing this at their pace is so difficult for me. As for school mom and I agreed to a PE class and to a regular class but I feel like I have to jump in hard and go full time and do all this other shit and mom wont let me because I will freak out and drop out again and shes funding me. She told me this is something I need to take baby steps with and perhaps shes right. Maybe I should do some journaling tonight.... this might be good...,GiveMe40Days,cu3oakl,1,t5_2skxv
