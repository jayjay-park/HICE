210626,0,t1_cf2bb7e,Thanks for the info. Im eating an unprocessed diet based on starches and  lbs of vegetables per day cookedraw. It improved my health in every way but there is still this joint problem developing. I changed my diet about  years ago. I used to be sick with coldssore throats  cold sores multiple times per year. I havent actually been sick now since before I changed my diet over  years ago. My immune function is pretty good at least against the typical tbacteria and viruses so I dont know wtf is going on. Regarding neurological symptoms I sometimes experience tingling in my hands and feet but Im also a bulimic so that is more likely from transient electrolyte imbalance primarily from hypokalemia but that would also have nothing to do with twisting painful and swelling joints bulimia.

263590,0,t3_1vk8ww,Your doctor DOES sound a little shady that vaccine thing.That being said I dont think many doctors willing to treat Lyme take insurance. Mine doesntOn the Vitamin D thing. People will persistent illness tend to have low Vitamin D. I think there was a recent study implying that low D might be the result of and not the cause of Chronic Illness. B tends to be low in patients with Lyme. Magnesium too. So this checks out.A quick google search shows that curcumin is the primary thing in enhansa. Ive seen this recommended many times for Lyme but you can probably save money buy using regular curcumin not whatever magic stuff your doctor sell.Your symptoms sound like Lyme or CFS Fibro..etc. What have your tests shown? Have you had them done by Igenix?I too have Lyme and am skeptical. Its hard not to be with all the conflicting information out there. According to the CDCFDA etc I dont have Lyme they only care about the Western Blot test for which I was negative not the PCR test which directly detects Lyme DNA for which I was positiveGet multiple opinions and dont trust any of them.

4246419,0,t3_39h6do, Im sorry that this is getting such negative responses. I havent been to the West Clinic and cant attest to its success but throughout years of treatment the only thing that has helped me has been a combination of alternative medicine and conventional western medicine. Part of what makes lyme so difficult to treat is that it disrupts many systems in the body immune endocrine etc and so recovering can require support for these damaged systems. This is in my opinion why conventional therapies alone failed me for the time I was exclusively on them they may prevent more damage from being done by killing the bacteria but they do not promote healing of the damaged cells and systems. The prevailing belief is that the body is meant to do this on its own but after many years of sickness this process needs to be facilitated even if only to merely accelerate healing. What makes the issue more complicated is that antibiotics and medications often arent even effective in killing all of the harmful infections present in ones body. This is for a number of reasons. One is that there are dozens of possible coinfections that ticks carry and transmit along with lyme that are not targeted by the common antibiotics given for lyme babesia is one example the common medication given even to kill off babesia is an antimalarial agent the best available option and it is often not effective. Another reason is that the lyme spirochetes have multiple different forms and some forms cannot be targeted by the antibiotic there are four forms I believe and each needs to be targeted in a different way. The cyst form is what is meant when a person says the bacteria goes into hiding and I dont know whether there are effective antibiotics for killing off this form. There was recently an article posted about a pulse protocol that describes this posted in this sub. One additional reason is that the bacteria create biofilms which protect them from the action of the medications. Furthermore arent we all aware of the failings of the scientific community at least in relation to Lyme? So then why all the negativity toward anecdotal evidence? A lot of what conventional doctors are doing to help lyme patients would also be considered anecdotal and unscientific by the larger medical community dont forget that many have lost their licenses for trying to treat chronic lyme!. There will hopefully come a time when the treatments that are effective come to be grounded and supported by science but until then why allow the failings of the medicalscientific establishment to prevent you from being open to effective treatments? I get that people want  complete confidence in their treatments but if you can trust the source why not listen to anecdotal evidence if it can help you? Not everything that isnt supported by science is wrong or ineffective science has limitations and is constantly growing to overcome them. All Im saying is that you have to weigh the risk and reward of alternative treatments and not dismiss them out of hand. There are promising avenues of medicine that are either new to or unexplored by western medicine. Furthermore the guy is indeed not a medical doctor but he has an ND naturopathic doctorate along with many other certifications. Its a different branch of medicine sure but though many of you would claim otherwise its not unscientific. The philosophy of naturopathic doctors goes against much of the current status quo in medicine but that doesnt make it wrong. My personal belief is that in the coming years naturopathic medicine will gradually displace the drug model of managing symptoms without addressing the underlying causes though to say it will be an uphill battle is an enormous understatement.,Lyme,cs4a6h9,2,t5_2rzlq

4766934,0,t1_ctvbfut,This was very elucidating. Thank you. Im not interested in homeopathic remedies or chemtrails. So this is valuable knowledge. Is LLMD some kind of code for a doctor who practices well off the beaten path? I was totally unaware of this. I was told to look into LLMDs by the people in my POTS support group but some of them also think that crystals and essential oils help their condition. Im not here to say that it doesnt work for them but I dont ever see it working for me. Also Im not sure if the woo aspect of that group is the same who are referring me to LLMDs but I was just shocked to receive a message from someone saying that a doctor could lose their license for treating Lyme which seems much farther into left field than Im willing to tread. It would appear that I need to change primary care physicians. She has mentioned nothing about a followup test in  days. Her response to the negative was to shrug. Shes been utterly out of her depth with regard to the rest of my illness so this isnt a huge surprise. Its clear that I need to be seeking more educated primary care. I really appreciate your letting me know about the protocol. She wasnt saying my insurance didnt cover it. She was saying that genetic testing of any kind wasnt available within her hospital system and so she wouldnt be able to help me with regard to doing an iGeniX test. Im fairly certain that they might require their own paperwork I used to work at a testing lab but shes never balked at doing paperwork before  I think in this case its a bit of Hanlons razor. Shes fumbled in the clutch on a number of occasions and Im afraid this is just one more time. Ive been thinking about getting a new PCP for months but have been frankly overwhelmed by medical procedures and testing.

I suffered from severe pain and swelling in my urinary tract testicle and groin area lymph nodes.  I found blood in my semen on several occasions.  I visited multiple urologists and took probably  different rounds of STD blood tests and yet the labs always came back negative for standard STDs.  The doctors were convinced I had some bacterial UTItype infection due to my symptoms even though I had no positive tests.  So they prescribed me  days of oral cipro or doxy on probably  different occasions. My symptoms would improve after five days but then would come back.  Eventually I learned to just deal with the symptoms.  I didnt get diagnosed with Lyme until many years later when I developed a slew of other symptoms that spiraled out of control.Im no scientist but if I think the fact that Lyme can produce blood in my semen and severe pain in my urinary tract suggests that it may be transmitted sexually.

I myself started getting sick when i was living in South America and although i understood the language the doctors were quick to dismiss me thinking that i was just an oversensitive white guy.  I was prescribed antidepressants and muscle relaxers and told to just dont think about being sick...lol.  I didnt touch the meds though.Reading your experience there were several points that really stood out to me as being eerily familiargtfeels like my body is shutting down to a total halt.gtoverwhelming feeling of brain foggtmuscle pain and joint paingttrouble with digestion and often have a bloated stomach and crampsgtpalpitations and a heavy heart beatgtThe symptoms are constant but all seem to rally together at various points in what really feel like flare upsSince lyme is really complicated and can express itself in many ways i think it certainly could be lyme.  But living in a foreign country opens up many other options also and doesnt have to be instead of Lyme but can be in addition to.  With me it was lots of different kinds of parasites that had migrated all over my body in addition to lyme.  I can send you a PM with more details but wanted to make this public for anyone else in a similar situation to know that especially if you are living in a foreign country then theres a lot of things that the locals are immune to but we arent.  Also theres nothing that says it is just ONE thing that is making us sick it can be far more complicated than that.  But this shouldnt scare anyone im still living in a foreign country and would never move back to my home country even though its a st world country.  But its super important to always remember that when we get sick we are not a standard patient we can have bits and pieces from many different places and its important to find a doctor that understands that. ,Lyme,d1m24e4,2,t5_2rzlq

Many of these patients seem to be suffering from stressburnoutdepression. The problem is that instead of pointing the patients towards this diagnosis instead some doctors keep looking for other things that might be causing the symptoms. Then if they dont find anything they throw up their hands and say I dont know whats wrong or even worse they say theres nothing wrong with you.You can still be a caring useful evidencebased doctor while still pointing patients towards correct treatments.

10816218,0,t3_5u53o6,Well the first step in Rife is wading through all the disinformation out there online about it.  Talk to someone that has actually used one not someone who halted their research after reading the Rife entry at Quackwatch is there a more obviously biased site on the internet?.  Theres another group of people who dont understand how it works so they immediately discount it.  And then theres people who are paid to spread lies about it online as the pharmaceutical industry considers anything that isnt drugbased medicine competition.  Several routinely post on this subreddit.  I have experimented with Rife Machines now for over  hours.  The technology works but it is a bit too effective with certain frequencies.  Youll have to be extremely careful the first few runs as the resulting herxheimer reaction can last days.  Some of the coinfections like Babesia have immediate herxes but a herx from Borrelia burgdorferi sets in anywhere from  to  hours after you treat with Rife.  It can be severe too nausea vomiting diarrhea.  I recommend you start with no more than  seconds the first time if you plan on going after Bb.  My suggestion would be address common coinfection viruses first.  It seems the size of the microbe determines your herx severity so by the logic one would work smallest to largest.  Small microbes like viruses are not so bad mycoplasma is worse bacteria is bad parasites which are huge comparatively result in a severe herx.  Common viruses with chronic illness are HHV Epstein Barr Cytomeglovirus Herpes Simplex Varicella Zoster etc.  All of these can be hit with a Rife machine.  Then move onto Mycoplasma and do Mycoplasma pneumonia Mycoplasma fermentans Mycoplasma hominis etc.  Then bacteria like Babesia Erlichia Borrelia.  I wasnt able to address Babesia that quickly but people online claim it can be taken care of in a weekend.  Leave Bartonella for last that is the one people struggle with the most.  So much so that I almost would recommend taking pharmaceutical drugs to address it.  Some strains are extremely fast growing so you end up Rifing every day for weeks to get rid of it.   There are a lot better frequency lists out there than this one but its a good start all in HzBorellia burgforderi  Hz      Higher harmonic of Bartonella    Higher harmonic of Bartonella Quintana Babesia       Mycoplasma Borrelia afzelii .Borrelia garinii .Anaplasma Erlichia Epstein Barr Virus XMRV Final advice is go slow in the beginning until you figure out what your body can handle and what is too much.  The limiting factor with Rife as it is with antibiotics or herbal medicine is your bodys detoxification ability.  If you still have a headache from your previous session wait and do NOT do another Rife session.  It will get worse.  I wish you luck.  Any questions please ask away!,Lyme,ddvm7i7,1,t5_2rzlq
10831539,0,t3_5usvpv,I was just ordered off abx by my llmd recently after being on them for a year.

Also did   lb. Romanian deadlifts last Friday no straps without my cheteplagued joints rebelling like they usually do with those.Weve also figured out how to make Bicillin shots hurt as little as possible which is a relief.

Ive had to take these to stop the pain. Im also on a couple psych drugs mainly because my system is wrecked and it will take awhile to heal.
