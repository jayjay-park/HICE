4627716,0,t1_ctds98w,gtgt  the native population is not unique in this regardgtYeah they kind of are. They are the only population forced into residential schools where they suffered this abuse.There were plenty of ethnicities that were systematically abused. The Chineese who built the railroad? the Japanese WW internment camps and loss of assets and Im sure there are others that I dont recall. You dont see those ethnic groups complaining or clamoring for special treatment. There are other countries who have had the equivalent of residential schools see USSR. Your aboriginal culture isnt unique in this regard. Many ethnicities have suffered. Most moved on. Yours is the only one that continues to blame its existing condition on everyone else. All this while having an unprecedented access to many opportunities should it choose to make an effort.Lets look at other countries. There were massive casualties wartorn families after WW. In China under Maos regime millions lost their lives and identities. Mao literally had instituted cultural genocide. Reforms made under Stalin caused missive deaths migrations suffering in USSR. Massive loss of identity homes lives culture etc permeate just about every country. Yet everyone seemed to have moved on in those parts. Perhaps instead of giving incentives and appeasing a certain fraction of population we just make a level playing field. You want better life gt work for it. The field isnt level it benefits the native population but they just dont take advantage of it but some do so more power to them. gtWhy would the government give refugees from another country treaty benefits? They have no treaty with these refugees. Thats pretty easy to grasp I imagine. All these extra benefits you list are extra benefits our government agreed to. They are getting what they were promised and nothing more  in fact they arent even getting everything they were promised. You sound really butthurt about this but you cant just ignore a signed treaty because its no longer convenient for you to honour it. Is government not upholding the treaties? Is the land being taken away? What specific clauses of the treaties are being violated? Have the government stopped paying treaty payments? I dont recall original treaties mandating reserved spots in schools guaranteed job placement or university scholarships for native population. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Id say government went above and beyond to reconcile the atrocities they conducted in the past. As far as refugees go govnt made a social contract with refugees to provide them with citizenship and all the benefits that entails. Why shouldnt govnt provide extra benefits for ALL  citizens in need? gtIm not a social worker psychiatrist psychologist nor am I a program coordinator. Im also not in a position to be able to enact any of these programs so Im not going to waste my time to come up with detailed descriptions of what these programs encompass to satisfy a random person already cranky about what he does or doesnt get from the government on the internet.You dont have to be any of it to promote participate in and plan for positive change. Your response sounds like shirking responsibility. You want things to change in your benefit yet unwilling to get off your ass. You want others to solved YOUR problems.You dont need to provide these details to me. Bring these up to your community leaders. Why do you elect them if they cant lead? gtYou clearly dont understand what the point of the residential schools was and how effective they were at achieving that goal. I was going to tell you to look it up and come back to this but youre clearly a spoon feed me everything type of person so  the goal was to strip away the Native American culture. Strip them of their languages their beliefs convert them to Christianity and tame the savages. The leaders and Chiefs were part of that Native American culture  you know the one the Canadian government had worked so hard to strip them of. Do you still not understand why relying on the leaders alone isnt enough as many no longer look towards them as a guide or a leader anymore  those same ones also happen to be the ones that are most in need of helpIm very well aware of history. Thank you for the lesson s.Ive asked you why cant your leaders lead? All I heard was waaaaa residential schools. Yes Im aware last one closed in s. However their influence started to diminish a few decades before that. And according to stats only approximately  of aboriginal children attended them. You make it sound like the ENTIRETY of native children were forced in to the residential schools. Yes the schools were bad and should have never existed. So residential schools is the ultimate excuse now for you culture?Yes relying on leaders isnt enough. The people need to put in effort to for positive change. Stop waiting for govnt or others to wave their magic wands and bring on the reign of unicorns.Your own people not looking up to their cultural leaders is entirely the governments fault too? Let me guess? Residential schools. Perhaps majority of your culture has moved on and found leaders in others good or bad. The bottom line things change countries and cultures evolve. You can continue singing the oftrepeated song and blame everyone while doing nothing to improve yourself and your culture.gtIts unclear as to whether you are referring to the programs I was talking about the government creating to help them or the ones already in place. If youre referring to the former theres no reason why they couldnt. If youre referring to the latter it probably has something to do with the fact that nonNative Americans never signed a treaty with the Canadian government promising access to said programs.Huh? Whaaaaat? You are sounding incoherent. There are already programs in place and many more being proposed. All you have to do as Canadian citizen is show is apply and qualify. Above and beyond treaty agreements.Please show me which treaties signed that specifically guaranteed job placement reserved educational spots university scholarships  and businesseconomic development funding. Most treaties are about fishinghunting rights territories boundries sovereignty selfgoverning on reservations policing and oversight of natural resources. You know the stuff that was of most concern to the native population when these were signed. You seem to be confusing government programs and incentives for businesses that were enacted on much later to help the native population vs. actual signed treaties. So the govnt went beyond just what the signed treaties had said.I dont expect you to change your entitled view even when facts are right in front of you.gtAgain youre blaming this on cultural problems when its literally the opposite. As Ive said this whole time these problems stem from the Residential schools  the same schools whose primary goal was cultural genocide. If this was a cultural problem the residential schools wouldve fixed that. This is more of a lack of culture problem compounded by the historic trauma caused by the residential schools.Waaaaaaa residential schools are at the root of everything that is wrong with native culture. No. Stop this. The blame isnt one sided like you want to make it. Both the govnt and the culture are responsible.What govnt did was wrong and atrocious but there are plenty of opportunity for aboriginals if they want out and improve themselves. However certain elements of aboriginal culture are like the proverbial crabbucket. They force you to conform and continue the cycle where blame is placed entirely on govnt for your own shitty conditions.  And when someone wants to improve gt they are white now and betrayed own people. The culture is to blame for prolonging its own suffering. gtI imagine if you had suffered through what many in the native community suffered youd be whining even louder than they ever have. You havent even suffered through anything and youre already whining plenty. Maybe youre right residential schools are the fault of First Nations people and not the government. Get your head out of your ass.You are now just perverting the argument now. And waaaaawaaaaa residential schools again. Let alone you are unable to comprehend what Im saying. In any case. I can go living in the past blaming my ancestral suffering under StalinMaoGenghis Khan for the situation I might be in. Or I take control of my life and better myself and perhaps my culture.Im not whining. WTF? You are the one whining and projecting it on me. I gave you examples where aboriginals have plenty of opportunities. Im a proponent of such opportunities. I merely asked you why given such an uneven playing field that benefits the aboriginal population with many economic incentives the said population remains unmotivated to change which results with low education level high crime rate substance abuse problems high incarceration rates etc etc?Its culture issue. No more excuses. Change starts within. Change the culture everything else will follow.,regina,ctdw8gd,2,t5_2rbqo

Maybe Im just prone to bad luck but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. The electrical outlets have no ground which is not up to code and therefore illegal.

10341563,0,t1_dcg9w03,We are long time regular customers since this place opened but it has done nothing but run down hill over the last couple of years. With the kitchen change things got worse and since November the service is some of the worst Ive experienced. Yesterday Sat Jan  was the last straw though. AllYouCanEat Taco night  but it wasnt really because it took an hour or more to get each plate. Drinks were equally slow and one of our party had to wait  mins before he found out what he ordered wasnt being made that night. The worst I got the wrong order and spat it out when I realised it because I dont eat what they served me. They took the plate away but then brought it back up and served it to another of us and told us it was freshly made!  complete with the chunk Id spat out right where I left it! Absolutely apalling. They gave us a free pizza  that I couldnt eat  to compensate but what a joke they shouldve given us the meal for free after that.Slow Pub you served us well for many years but we wont be returning. Not after that horribly mishandled debacle. And no dont just blame your servers and replace them the place has been mismanaged for a while now and your food is nowhere near the quality it used to be.

If that is your background be ready to downshift your expectations as to museums restaurants parks etc.  Also people can be very curious of outsiders which can manifest in staring.  This happens to me and my family a lot in restaurants at the mall etc.  Also people dont really walk anywhere here  it is a very drivingoriented city  and drivers arent used to pedestrians.  There are also very few places to go outside the city so get ready for long drives.  However the UofR is a friendly and supportive institution and can make up for other things.
