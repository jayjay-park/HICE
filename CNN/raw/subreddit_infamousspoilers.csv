668613,0,t3_21jqx1,The way I see it was like he said he wasnt gonna let anyone get in his way of helping them. In the process of trying to help them he lost his brother. To be told that he went through everything that happened and that he lost his brother for nothing really hurt him. He put up with everything and risked his life for them and the thanks he gets is being told he disgraced his brother and that they didnt want him to help them. Like it is mentioned in the game a normal person has a bad day they punch a wall or break something a conduit has a bad day the body count is in the double digits.In his anger he probably thought something along the lines of Fine you want to die? Then let me help you. He was angry and hurt and he lashed out. Im not saying he was right in what he did. Im saying I understand his reasons and cant say if I was in his position that I wouldnt do the same.,infamousspoilers,cgg9qyw,1,t5_30ybg
