4557988,0,t3_3dh0cv,Im hoping that the talents of Art Bell will inspire CC staff to try harder to not suck so much... and perhaps stop doing lowquality shows about angels and numerology and predictions and for the love of Jesus stop that tedious UFO report!Im hoping that Art will inspire Noory to pay attention to what his guests are saying and perhaps ask a few intelligent questions occasionally...Im not sure if there is any way to tell if the CC audience numbers has declined over the last few years or if Arts new show Midnight in the Desert... staring on July  will impact those numbers.Id never consider paying for CC however I became an early Midnight in the Desert subscriber over a month ago in excited anticipation of some good paranormal talkback radio! ,coasttocoastam,ct55j8b,3,t5_2shlp
