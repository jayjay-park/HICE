7265474,0,t1_d240jig,Oh definitely. Ive noticed that Ive been paying more attention everywhere I go. Unfortunately I live in a downtown area and theres the occasional person asking for money. Theyre not aggressive yet but theres one who will walk right up to people at an ATM thats nearby. Is there a good site to look up training courses? I know a couple of the bigger ranges offer them but that doesnt necessarily mean theyre any good. Thanks for looking out stay safe out there friend. ,FLGuns,d2417f8,1,t5_353ab
