8158095,0,t3_4r0fjc,gtOkay. First off Im a Habs fan. Born in MTL Ive always stuck with the team.gtgtAlso lets have a real discussion here this is better than vegetable and sandwich posts IMO.gtgtSo FAF is over. gtI realize Im late to the show but I created an account and this wouldnt post.gtI tried to post this early on Friday morning but it didnt post.gtgtLong time lurkerdeleted user here. Wednesday was an incredibly disappointing day for Habs fans not because of who we acquired but because we lost one of the most personable hockey players out there and we all feel like management lied to us about it. So  was a good season for us. Price was a god carrying the team on his shoulders. But EVERY GODDAMN FAN I KNOW complained about Price having shoddy defence and not having the backup he needed. Dont get me wrong but PK never was and never will be a top defensive defenseman in the league. He didnt back up Price the way Weber has backed up Rinne and as mad as you all are you cant tell me Im wrong. How many games have you cursed at your TV because PK hung Price out to dry on a shit turnover that he made because he was trying to emulate Patrick Kane? Forget the stats. Forget all the bullshit rumours. Forget the  games where he was actually a playoff force and remember the  other playoff games hes had. Remember the games where the Rangers FUCKED US INSIDE OUT and tell me you loved PKs style off the ice and thought he should be captain and was better than anyone else out there. If our whole team has gone to shit because we lost a good personality then maybe it was time for him to go. Hockey is everything on and off the ice but the game of hockey isnt donations and smiling for fans and being trendy and a comedian. COMEDIANS DONT WIN HOCKEY GAMES heh Bryz could and would vouch for that. Hockey spirit isnt about being pissy that you didnt get the C or even an A you think he wasnt? Think again its ultimately about performing well or poorly when your team expects you to carry your team. Lets be fuckin real if Subban was out all season and Price started playing . GAA and . then he would be on the next plane out of town and we would be the ones calling for it. Subban was expected to play better than he did and support our FUCKING ROOKIE goalie. Dont blame Condon for his soft goals. You all saw where the shots were coming from and we all know those could have been easily avoided by a more solid defensive core. IM NOT JUST BLAMING PK BUT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR CAREY PRICE THIS YEAR. Theyre our two biggest players and if youre being honest PK let you down last season. Karlssons team didnt do a whole lot better than ours but guess what he still stepped up every fucking game. I just think you should reevaluate how you all thought of PK as much as we will all miss him and wonder is Weber gonna be that bad? FUCK NO. Maybe hes older than Subban but hes a proven leader on ice which Subban cant say. Shea is also not a cocky bastard dont lie youve thought it about Subban at least once. Is Weber what we maybe all asked for? Guess well find out but I for one think we all asked for this to happen.gt,sports_undelete,d4xb6ad,1,t5_3erse

Have we not mined from its depths the entirety of its hidden riches squeezed it dry of its divine bounties?

Last season was The Season of Tears. For seven months as we lost celebrities as the world reeled from terror and upheaval as America redefined itself in frightening and unprecedented ways baseball came through like it had never done before. In a year of frenzy and uncertainty baseball comforted us distracted us and showed us the best we could dream of the best we could hope for from the game from ourselves and from this life.gtgtWe said goodbye to a slugger in Boston who always seemed to come through for us when we needed him and who left us with the feeling we could have seen so much more.

We gnashed our teeth at the commissioner and spent our summer catching pokmon behind the safety net as the pitch clock wound down. The two greatest home runs of the season involved a yearold pitcher from the Dominican Republic. He hit the first and we cheered and cried. He surrendered the second and we cheered and cried. Tears.gtgtAnd in a year where anything is possible continually proved true Americas Team  the team that embodied the little guy the everyman the underdog the team that endured as a centurylong joke and broke the hearts of doughboys and their greatgrandchildren alike  proved that every once in a while you get your day in the sun. We asked for a story of redemption and triumph in a year of turmoil and they gave us something for which poets will never come close to articulating in crude human language. A comeback of exquisite and valorous beauty against an opponent equally worthy of song culminating in one final game one game of legend which by all feeling and instinct should be the last game ever played. gtgtAnd yet here we are again. Isnt this selfish? Wasnt all that enough? Do we have any tears left? What do you get the fan who has everything?gtgtWere here because we still need baseball. Were still alive and kicking through thick and thin and now more than ever we need something comforting and familiar. There is nothing more comforting and familiar than baseball. It has always been there as long as we have been here scientists claim the universe is old but we know that on opening day God breathed life into Abner Doubleday and fashioned from his rib a bat of mighty ash and sent us a savior in the Babe to forgive our sins. This is our religion and though all prophecies have now come to pass and all curses have now been lifted we the latterday flock will still congregate at our thirty altars take the sacrament of hot dog and Budweiser and sing a hymn about our flag standing high no matter what happens because there will always be new stories to tell and new curses to break and always every day a new miracle never before witnessed.gtgtIn Americas greatest novel which described our game as the faith of fifty million people Fitzgerald represented the American dream as a green light beckoning through the darkness close enough to see but never within our reach. It seems to me that there is indeed an American dream and it is green...but it is not a light. It is a field an irregularlyshaped expanse patched idiosyncratically into the grid of the city walled off from the anguish of national politics and personal misery. We gather around its hearth and take in the sunlight and watch grown men play a childs game. In the spring we hope and the standings are tied and all have a fair shake. In the summer we fight and sweat and do what we can with what we have. In the fall we resign ourselves to the reality of the scoreboard. Thats life in the perfect metaphor of the American equation. Effort over time. Maybe next year. Next year we will run faster stretch out our arms farther and one fine morning....gtgtThat is the ritual which begins today with the jet flyovers and the eagle handlers and the grandstand bunting. The celebration of the struggle. Because this year could be next year. After all last season was the ultimate next year. It was the Season of Tears. What will we call this season?gtgtWho are we kidding. It will also be the Season of Tears. They all are.,sports_undelete,dfqaebf,1,t5_3erse

11786835,0,t3_686kjg,gtDue to his decent form and a good combination with Pearce people have been suggesting both on here and in the media that he would be a good choice for the Blues. I think theyll pick Maloney but lets just discuss even entertaining the idea of picking Keary. gtgtgtThis article here shows Mal Meninga saying that Keary should be eligible Queensland and makes mention of the appeal Keary lodged with tha NRL to be allowed to play for Queensland. gtgtAt what point do our selectors just have to rule him out all together. I know it must suck for the bloke not being allowed to play for the side that he is passionate about but I dont think that he should then be considered for the side that he most likely hates. gtgtOrigin is the fiercest rivalry in the game. You can hold your own opinion about whether Test matches should be a bigger deal than Origin but the reality is that they arent. Theres no passion anywhere fiercer than Origin and selecting someone who would rather be showing that passion for the other side just isnt something that the Blues can afford to do. gtgtKeary should never play Origin unless he somehow convinces the NRL to let him play for Queensland. ,sports_undelete,dgw2s51,1,t5_3erse
