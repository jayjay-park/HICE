1256152,0,t1_cianyge,It really isnt a change so much.  We have been using android apps for a long time now.  Those that loaded their own OSes even longer.  Even the official android support has been around for a  long time.  BB at launch even supported android with basically a BB wrapper on it.  This just makes it easier for people to make choices.  Honestly there are enough bb apps for most of what you would want.  Netflix has gone html and I suspect many others will be going that way so apps wont matter in  years anyway... they will but there wont be the big hype like there is now...

1341326,0,t1_cikfzv1,It is idiot proof. They discard anything that could confuse the user regardless of the benefit to said user. Live icons? Nope. Swappable memory  battery? Nope. USB ? Nope. True multitasking? Nope. They are FINALLY getting overlays with text messaging. Finally. I know that part of that is to funnel money into them which is a con in its own right but some of it is just ridiculous. You honestly think people cant handle their own multitasking? Not lacking in specs. Hardware reliability. I have warrantied out more Ss and Note s than any phone that has ever launched. Many within the first  days. Just flimsy. You cant compare Apples to Apples on CPU speed crossplatform. If you ran Android . on a Z it would crawl. Running .. or newer on it is instantaneous everything. BlackBerry resets take longer because they are more indepth. It isnt just trashing the pointers. It is writing false data over the old data to prevent recovery. All phones get warrantied out through the carrier. That way you can get the replacement before you have to send in the old. In most cases BB Link from one to the other and go...

Fits into pockets easier than a Note or  Plus would because its shorter had a Note  before the Z. But if you do want a smaller phone I would personally take a Classic over Z just because it will keep you on track. I find myself browsing Redditplaying simple gameswatching YouTube more with the Z because of the form factor.One thing I will say for the  Passport as well is Google Maps function infinitely better as well. The default maps app is good but it doesnt keep up to date as well as Google Maps does. Missed a turn because of a closed road a few weeks back that Google saw but BlackBerry Maps didnt.

The curved screen also increases the possibility for damage to the screen drastically as a curved screen is inherently weaker than a normal one  not to mention the increased surface area increases the possibility that the phone will land on its screen when it falls.Then theres the questionable quality control for the phone. Quite a few people seem to complain about the phone creaking whilst its in use and feeling quite unsolid.All in all the Priv seems to me like a huge step backwards for build quality compared to any of the BB devices.

Some are completely defunct and others are hobbled including popular apps like Facebook.  Modern apps work with backend server technology so if the app developer isnt updating the apps they will eventually cease to function properly.  The reason Blackberry Classic is dead is because it had no developer support to begin with I doubt youll see developers support any kind of updates for this dead platform.,blackberry,d4tns5z,4,t5_2qnpz

8600972,0,t1_d6glvk8,Thanks but setting hub email to work every  minutes just wont work for me. I am using Corporate Exchange and I definitely need my email pushed to me instantly sometimes  minutes would cost me thousands in resulting costs or losing an account. As example the other day at  we got an email I noticed that client said the given info was inaccurate I reached out to my operation team and they realized there was a typo on given information which prevented customer from doing something that if not done would cost huge expense over the weekend. So  minutes or even  minutes might be too late for me. When I was trying android I used Touchdown email client it was extremely efficient the only downside was it worked with only  account and it was slow to sync multiple folders. As for contacts as of this post I have  Items in my Contact List in Outlook. Will Priv be OK with that many contacts? My PP never cared how many I have and never slowed down when I searched through thousands of contacts reading their notes which I constantly update I use my Contacts as CRM.Datawise I have no issues I have unlimited data.,blackberry,d6gpqy0,2,t5_2qnpz

10962459,0,t1_de9x56p,As I said this phone isnt meant for an average consumer. Companies prefer security over a common phone because a breach of privacy can lead to competitive disadvantage lawsuits and much more in losses.

11071827,0,t3_5y270n,I came to ask the same question.  As of yet they indicate iOS and Android were susceptible towards hacking.  That said if proven true this could be a huge boost towards blackberry sales.  No wonder so many in the state justice etc departments still rock s.
