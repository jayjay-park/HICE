199823,0,t3_1we7jv,You may want to build a smeltery early for the upgraded tools. Thats part of tinkers construct.After that I go to IC for early ore processing.Then I usually go to Forestry Multi Farms and get a sapling farm going using IC power.The saplings are later used to Biofuel production with a Fermenter and a still.I transfer the Biofuel into Railcraft Iron Tanks using Fluiducts these are WAY better than waterproof pipes but typically I used waterproof pipes first and then upgrade that later.Typically at this point I venture into the nether and construct an electric jetpack for transportation. I use a Generator to charge it early on until I get more power production.Typically from here I start working on power generation now that I have a fuel source. Any enginesgenerators that use Biofuel are fair game. Gregtech is a great place to start once you have the infrastructure setup. GT is also really complex compared to a lot of other mods and usually requires stupid amount of materials but thats part of the charm.I just find Biofuel production to be very easy early game. Later I like to upgrade to nuclear as its crazy crazy efficient and easy to maintain. I dont know if energy converters are in this mod but if they are then you can just use biofuel and make huge lines of combustion engines and convert MJ to EU. Thats what I liked to do in ultimate but idk if thats still a possibility. If you know DW well then start there. It really doesnt matter a whole lot. If you arent sure then just gather ores and get a macerator or a pulverizer and some a furnace to match. It takes several weeks to acclimate to a massive pack at least for me and I usually take baby steps and try to enjoy it. ,TestPackPleaseIgnore,cf17a5s,1,t5_2zeqd

663000,0,t3_21p5el,EDIT Most of the problems here were fixed in ...Im sorry guys but this update is an absolute disaster.MFFS and tesseracts are broken again At least I think its the tesseracts the Force Manipulater deleted two vacuum hoppers and the MFFS energy generation and storage blocks plus a few itemducts.Theres something funky going on with chunkloading and tesseracts as the two chunks containing my tesseract and my chunkloader reset completely deleting most of my base. I decided to start up a new world maybe try botania maybe try some new stuff.The botania plants ignore particle settings so since I have to put particles on minimal for my laptop to run TPPI in reasonable fashion and they spawn in excessive amounts they utterly destroy my FPS and cause my world to work extremely slowly something that is absolutely lethal when the zombies start running whatever it is they do to make all zombies nearby attack because botania  zombies  nearly frozen computer. I could consistently run at about  fps on .. dipping to  when zombies were swarming with a x MFR treefarm cobblegen and a golem Magical Crops farm. Now Im consistently at  and it goes to  when zombies attack and I have the basic TiC stuff and a couple of furnaces no machines or anything.Oh and the graves youre supposed to leave behind with your stuff in now get blown up with you and destroy everything in your inventory if you die to a creeper. Even if any of your stuff gets left behind it now disappears in about a minute because it dropped from a block not from a player.So this update destroys worlds ruins your framerate and makes the earlygame an endless cycle of remaking all your tools to try and get anywhere.

That includes any health that you add through Tinkers Construct heart canisters. You will because I know that just turned off a lot of you and youre going to complain because its a permanent debuff. You will be able to craft that health pack. It will either cost you a dragon egg which you can either only get one of you can only get one of. If youre going to craft it with the dragon egg you cant reset the End. We dont have magic bees though do we? Isnt that working? Yeah once you get magic bees youll be able to craft the egg. Right now you cannot craft another egg. For those of you saying Oh Hardcore Ender Expansion lets you reset the End.  You need the dragon egg for that. So yeah. Alternatively you know those enhanced Galgadorian blocks that nobody ever makes because theyre not worth it? Is  of your health worth it? Because thats what you get. Yeah thats how you get it back.   Q What kind of load times are you guys experiencing?   Thirtyeight minutes? Are you serious with that eskaay? I thought you were joking. Yeah yeah Im completely joking. I think I loaded it in  minutes  seconds. I load on a MacBook Pro with GB of RAM and it loads in about  minutes I think. Yeah thats on the highend. My PC is probably more like  minutes but I have a really fast PC so it will vary between there. Its probably about the same as in . honestly. On a highend processor it will take much less to load than your general standard PC that you would buy in a store. It also depends on the speed of your RAM and what DDR you have. Not meaning Dance Dance Revolution here. If you need faster removing Gregtech reduces that by so much.  Q Why do you think the Mo Creatures dev wont allow his mod to be included in modpacks?   We have talked about this before. Were actually going to turn that into just a general question of Why do some people not allow their mods in packs?   Version control  there is none when you let modpacks use your mod   You will always receive bug reports of old versions of your mod which will usually include things that you have fixed months ago.  Q How important will Greg Tech be in TPPI?   The same as TPPI. It will not be required for any other mods. You can still go through IC without touching Greg Tech at all. Yeah. Hopefully. Hopefully yeah. If we can beat Greg into submission enough it will be the same as TPPI. If not youll have to kind of deal with the small little places where he sticks his fingers.  Q With all the oregen changes GregTech makes it seems almost impossible to ignore it. Is there going there going to be an option for me to play tech in TPPI and ignore it?   Yes. Yes.   Q Will TPPI include extra configs like in TPPI?   No. We included that because we needed to comply with the Feed The Beast universal configs. That is the only reason. There is no reason to anymore because theres no item IDs which is what the universal configs were for. If we did it now We would just be supplying default config files that would get generated if we didnt supply them. So yeah. And were not going to spend time balancing around mods that were not officially supporting. So yeah. Pretty much it will work but the only problems youre going to have is stuff when world generation gets in the way because a lot different mods have their own copper and stuff like that. Its just going to generate on their own. And theres nothing you can do about it unless you turn it off yourself. So thats pretty much it. Thats pretty much the only incompatibility youll find.   Q You mentioned youre interested in adding mods    No we didnt. Reread the OP.   Q What sorts of reasoning are used when deciding upon the relative costs of items and ore distribution in the pack?   Playability. Yeah just play it and see how it feels. If this is too easy or this is too hard then change it. Yeah. Yeah.  Q Why are you not going with GregTech ore gen? Personally I think its the best part of Greg Tech and it seems like a total assache to redo all of it in COFH.   Its not a total assache because we only had to add seven ores? I think? Uhh I believe it was eight but yeah. Eight okay.  So its not that bad. Its just JSON files so its not that difficult. We cant do GregTech ore gen because it really doesnt fit the pack. And every other pack that includes Greg Tech uses that ore gen. So yeah. Yeah its just We have this whole custom ore gen going that we already have our own style and then its just like this completely undoes it so eh!   Q What is going to be about the prettymuchrequired Mekanism fork?    Were going to fork it. Were going to fix it. And youre going to like it. Its going to keep going on.   Q When can we expect a new release of TPPI Tweaks?    Once we get the libraries to build again because they dont build right now. Dont know why but they dont. Blame tterrag yep. I dont know ugh! Its your job to know.   Q Either start answering questions or give us the video or the date for the video youre so keen on making.    No.  Q Given that most peoples experiences with individual mods is through YouTube videos for better or worse Is it a good idea to balance the pack through NEI recipes that will only serve to confuse a player that is new to a mod pack?   No because every single recipe that we change through well at least through TPPI Tweaks which is most of them Well it has a tooltip description of why we changed it. And unless you know the recipe by heart you will see that. Yeah. So yeah. I mean were nowhere near as bad as Agrarian Skies where a blood altar takes flux electrum ingots? I dunno. I dunno anyways theres things in there that dont make any sense at all but people are fine with it.   Q What is the most difficult thing youve had to deal with in the update to ..?   Mod updates. But now that were so late into ..  Greg Tech. It just It Everything was working fine and then we install GregTech and everything broke. Everything. E v e r y t h i n g. And real life really also gets in the way. All of us have real lives. Yeah theres this terrible thing called college which pretty much all of us are involved in some way or another. Im involved in it by not doing it. Hey there you go. Thats a good solution for me.   Q Will there be Ancient Warfare? If not I highly suggest Ancient Warfare.    No. And since you asked never.,TestPackPleaseIgnore,cop15rt,1,t5_2zeqd

3896193,0,t1_cpzgxec,For rotarycraft while you can not modify things with Minetweaker you can make a request to include those balances in his config.If you can make a valid argument for he might make the change.gtWhat You Can DogtIf you do need to be able to change something in how RotaryCraft behaves and you do not currently have the ability to do this without using a thirdparty modification come to me.gtIf you can present a valid use case and the change does not cause significant side effects your request may be added as a config option which you are then free to modify. Several config options that currently exist are examples of this including the ability gtto disable block damage the ability to disable several noncore machines the ability to make the Borer and Extractor require maintenance the ability to disable automining and the ability to disable flight with the jetpacks.gtUnder no circumstances am I obligated to include anything suggested. If I do reject your idea I will explain my reasons for doing so but do not get aggressive or pushy. Suggestions which go against the four main tenets of the RC mod design  realism extremely powerful endgame advanced rendering and learning over grinding  are almost certainly going to be rejected without your providing a very good justification. Again however you will be informed of this.gtAny request with no real purpose I want an option for engines to play music soundsPlease add an option to make the blast furnace also craftable from diamond blocks or whose effects are crippling such as by making progression impossible I want an option to turn off all the required worldgenCan I have an option to disable engines? have no chance of being implemented. ,TestPackPleaseIgnore,cr0ef30,1,t5_2zeqd
