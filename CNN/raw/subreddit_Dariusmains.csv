8085497,0,t3_4pz3ig,The item is meant for sticking power which Darius already has enough of in his kit with his W being a  slow and his E having a pretty heavy slow as well Darius doesnt need to stick to them he can already do that he just needs the damage to kill them with the tank stats to help before they kill you Your money is better spent on a titanic hydra if you really want to stack your passive quicker and have more damage and some decent tank stats Overall its a good item I guess but there are clearly better options being Titanic and Steraks If you want more dmg and some tank stats,Dariusmains,d4ovtqr,1,t5_390gk
8266060,0,t3_4snky1,Personally I pick Teemo. Majority of the time Darius is unable to fight back unless he gets the lvl  cheese kill.With Ignite and lvl  Darius just gets prevented from any real engage onto Teemo unless Teemo wastes the blind.Also Trundle is a good pick as was said earlier. ,Dariusmains,d5atcqn,3,t5_390gk

9107911,0,t3_54vwd3,While I do enjoy Darius old kit and how I could win a lot of lanes because not many people knew how he worked due to unpopularity I think hes in a perfectly fine spot. He hasnt had a nerf in what around  patches? He has consistently been a popular and strong top laner but only recently has he gotten the top ban rates for top lane. The clear reason is something Im unsure of since mostly everything has been the same in top lane besides Ekko being constantly rebalanced one way or another but he is perfectly fine balancewise in my opinion.If they wanted to do a small change to nerf him Id say just tone down either Base HPHP growth not both HP regen Mana Mana growth or Mana regen slightly. If one or two of those got nerfed itd make laning suck more for Darius if base HP regen got nerfed where he usually snowballs from in favorable matchups or if played right or gets cucked in because camping. Or just rebalance his power. Shift some early game to late game or vice versa but the rest of his stats AD Armor AS MS Range Scalings Cooldowns are all fine in my opinion.That being said Id be fine with a small nerf like aforementioned to make him more unpopular but I prefer Darius to be untouched by Riot as it stands.,Dariusmains,d86mhkp,1,t5_390gk

10701907,0,t1_ddjmqns,The only juggernaut I can think of that would build both steraks and tri force is yorick.Nasus never gets steraks because it gives no cdr and its stats suck ass for him.Darius doesnt build sheen items unless hes trying to get cheesy.Illaoi maybe though most illaois go cleaver gt deaths dance gt tankmordekaiser is another one who pulls off the combo but hes just ass in general and has way more problemsvolibear doesnt use it. Olaf doesnt get sheen items normally. Shyvana doesnt do sheen items. Udyr doesnt usually want steraks at all because it doesnt give cdr and its stats suck for him. Trundle can probably pull off the combo with his chomp but I doubt any trundle gets that stuff.,Dariusmains,ddjtm1g,2,t5_390gk

Both of you on equal health and with ultimate is heavily in Tryns favor.But as soon as you gain a health advantage the matchup tips heavily in your favor.The entire laning phase revolves around keeping a health advantage and deny fury.Your powerspike items against heavy AA attackers are ninja tabi and dorans shield.

Murder them right after they push back due to TP as you run them down from the river using ghost ofc.
