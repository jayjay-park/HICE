9886278,0,t1_dathz9l,Mr. Speaker the new government under the leadership of the Prime Minister is fully committed towards safeguarding India and its borders and our North Western frontier is no different. In the recent past we have signed many defense contracts and have pushed for local manufacturing of weapons and military equipment which are slowly starting to bear fruit. The Armed Forces have been allowed more teeth to tackle cross border infiltration and ceasefire violations and the results are starting to show. After tackling the military part its only natural and we flex the diplomatic muscle as well and revoking the Most Favored Nation is only the start.,imls,daw7eci,1,t5_3hb5j
