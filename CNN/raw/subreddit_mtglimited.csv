67878,0,t1_cem5byf,I would love to start drafting on MTGO. This sealed league is nice because I can schedule  my matches for whenever  but I find FNM drafts harder and harder to make it out to with a baby at home. MTGO seems like it could be the ticket for me. How much money should I put in to start?,mtglimited,cem5okf,1,t5_2vhwb
638328,0,t3_21g43x,didnt play during that period but watching streams it seems artifact hate is very good.Also any creature with evasion and infectblighted agent is very good then you prioritize pump spells to push through infect damage.,mtglimited,cgctu55,1,t5_2vhwb
1005984,0,t1_chileui,If you might be having issues I recommend listening to Limited Resources Eps  and . They are basic but very helpful. I do agree that your deck may need a fatty that can swing safely but it is drafting and you cant get everything you need. ,mtglimited,chimzh7,2,t5_2vhwb
1298340,0,t3_28j21g,In theros Id pick cockatrice only if second place meant the same thing as last place for me. Its a high variance pick you get a shot at an amazing deck with it but have a very high chance of wasting a bunch of important picks trying to get that deck until you notice youre being cut.,mtglimited,cifohop,1,t5_2vhwb

1398969,0,t3_2a5cnp,Dude are you serious Nightfire Giant as dead last? Id put him as first. Repeatable effects are HUGE in limited and Nightfires has an application all the time. The other kirds require other creatures for the most part to maximize value. Nightfire does not. You can ALWAYS ping them for  if you had the mana to do so which is a lot of the time in limited. Also his body is nothing to scoff at. And Nightfire fits into what is arguably the strongest m limited archetype right now. Also Escort is amazing in UW I have no idea how you reached these conclusions.,mtglimited,cirn3lr,10,t5_2vhwb

1676094,0,t1_cjqas7o,Couldnt say it any better myself. Beginners are going to have to learn from experience more than anything. This is why Magic is so awesome different players can approach a draft in different ways and have success.I almost want to edit my post and remove the Bread part because I just added that at the end as an additional suggestion. Really the other stuff I said should be followed more than anything. If you really want to learn how to play limited watch good streamers and listenread limited players articlespodcasts. Then play as much as you can. Thats going to be the best way to find out a card is good or bad.,mtglimited,cjqfmpa,2,t5_2vhwb
1681907,0,t1_cjqh56n,The thing is if youre the control and your blockers have been killed rather than successfully setting up your board stall congregate is just buying a little time.  Riot control in comparison buys a LOT of time is cheaper and has an incredibly strong potential upside if you can leverage the populate.  It had a good win on MTGO because its EXTREMELY good when its good while congregates best case is that its sometimes playable.,mtglimited,cjr615f,1,t5_2vhwb
1683653,0,t3_2do53x,You need a win condition.  You only really have Genesis Hydra and thats not really a win condition unless your opponent is sitting there with just nothing.  Try to be aware during the draft of when you have enough of cards like Zof Shade Acursed Spirit Chub Toad etc... and can take some more exotic cards.  It is really easy to load up on way too many mediocre creatures in this color pair.  This deck actually looks really reasonable.  Its possible you just didnt read the draft properly and thus were not passed bombs in these colors.  Burning Anger is good enough to splash even if you have no Boonweaver GiantsEvolving Wilds.  You still have a Metiorite.  Also I think Rotfeaster Maggot is good enough to start.  Some decks will fold to the lifegain if they didnt factor it and go all in.  I also disagree with  because you have  Black  drops and a Flesh to Dust,mtglimited,cjrdyfn,2,t5_2vhwb
1699613,0,t3_2duhtc,Wow. Stopped watching after PP. It almost seems like you were picking a completely arbitrary card in the hopes that it would work out for you.Watch some draft videos of other players pro or not and listen to their reasoning.,mtglimited,cjtedjz,-1,t5_2vhwb
2127351,0,t3_2jb4lb,Yes. And if you had picked up these cards early then you would have hopefully picked up some WR or UR duals to help with this. But even if not those two are very splashable.Like I really like playing Jeskai. But it feels like a lot of the Jeskai decks I draft are primarily UW with only a few R cards. But even with a little fixing this turns out okay.,mtglimited,cla8e50,1,t5_2vhwb
2267560,0,t3_2l6nil,Well I dont know why you are playing Cranial Plating in a mardu creature deck.  I would definitely play at the Take up Arms and the Ainok bondKin and probably the leaping master and bloodfire expert.  All are better than the Hateblade and  kill shots is a lot for a tokens deck.  Also its hard to think you arent trolling when there is a High Sentinels of Arashin just chilling in your sideboard...,mtglimited,clrznms,-1,t5_2vhwb
2295036,0,t3_2l3vrx,I dont get it. It says that Im queued for a draft but it also says that theres once waiting for players that I cant join. Im also not big on the fact that the app waits until the last possible moment to tell you that eventually youre going to be charging people for this which seems dishonest to me. ,mtglimited,clvds68,1,t5_2vhwb

4954991,0,t1_cuiqxqm,I think for a new drafter trying to do a Sphinxs Tutelage deck would be a mistake. Stick with creatures that pass the vanilla test.,mtglimited,cuj47ps,1,t5_2vhwb

5201372,0,t1_cvcq2dv,Im new to XMAGE. How do I import BFZ so it shows as a set within the application? I found the card images and copied them into the pluginsimages folder. What else do I need to do?,mtglimited,cvcyikz,2,t5_2vhwb
5645824,0,t1_cwwupu4,I have paid this format a lot like more than I should be and of the twenty or so matches I have seen a Gideon attempt to resolve the player casting won about  per cent of the time. Anecdotal sure but I know I was Disappointed with the performance and am not horribly scared of him like like chase rares in other recent formats. Removal for him is bad stasis snare and spell snare are probably the only options. But I feel he is very weak to Ux flyers any scion based strategy and gets blocked by basically all colorless Eldrazi.That said always snap pick him it is just not worth forcing yourself into white for. ,mtglimited,cwwx3dg,2,t5_2vhwb
5857069,0,t1_cxn2xge,With  packs between you two you shouldnt have a problem getting playable cards. I would argue that the chance of getting some overpowered commons and uncommons will be worth it considering that you will find unplayable cards in any set regardless. Those unplayable cards are just slightly more unplayable.,mtglimited,cxne1zv,2,t5_2vhwb

7948083,0,t3_4o2mdf,Id avoid the second and the third sets because they were not designed to be drafted without the first set of their block. Drafting from a core set alone should be fine.So that leaves all Core sets and Theros. I believe M has the most of cards that feel good to open. ,mtglimited,d49ftqp,1,t5_2vhwb
