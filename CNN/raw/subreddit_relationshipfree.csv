6828443,0,t3_4975zq,Yes! Freedom. It is the number one reason I am relationship free. I dont have to ask permission or align schedules when I want to go do something I want to do. I dont have to compromise on whats for dinner or which movie to watch on Netflix. My budget is my budget and if I ruin my credit or blow my discretionary fund in one place neither of which will ever happen because I am so careful with my money thats my own damn fault and not some irresponsible partners faults. I can vacation where I want when I want. I can get another cat if I want I can get a third dog without having to negotiate whether or not this is a thing thats good for our household. I can landscape my yard how I want. The list goes on.But one of the things I love the most is that I am not obligated to talk to anyone. Im not obligated to listen to anyone. If I sit down to eat dinner and dont feel like talking no one is going to ask me whats wrong or think that theyve done something wrong or think that Im mad. If I drive somewhere or take the bus or train I can do so in silence looking out the window and absorbing the scenery. And no one will try to coax me into conversation with chatter and small talk. I dont have to fill space with meaningless conversation. I dont have to pay attention while someone else talks. I can have glorious beautiful silence without having to worry about another persons feelings or whether Im withdrawing and not being present. I can read a book without guilt I can work on projects and not say a word I can walk my dogs in absolute silence. I have peace and freedom in my life.,relationshipfree,d0qayi5,4,t5_2ys9h
7013039,0,t3_4975zq,I didnt choose to be relationship free and in fact I spent a lot of time feeling sad to be single in my s. But as more time goes on I find myself feeling incredibly HAPPY. I have so much more energy now that Im not being drained by the constant DRAMA that any guy seems to bring into my world. Ive even started some new hobbies that are bringing so much joy into my life. I would be open to the right relationship in the future but I dont want this peace and freedom to end anytime soon. ,relationshipfree,d1b9xtb,3,t5_2ys9h
9750942,0,t1_d8nonpx,The first thing that I would say is that I have time to do whatever I want after a long day of studying and projects. Exactly this is the ultimate benefit for me too.  My time is my own and I dont have to ask or check in with a partner to see if whatever I want to do gives him a problem.  Enjoying the benefits of being RF works for women just as well as it does for men.  ,relationshipfree,daf0pbp,1,t5_2ys9h
