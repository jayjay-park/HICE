9627255,0,t3_5cacqt,Hey all I joined this server a few weeks ago and tried to get a few players across to join but to no avail....it seems after the paid dlc came out majority of my friends who played this got pissed off with them for doing that and stopped playing.I still enjoy the game but it seems after the fiasco of the paid dlc that a lot of servers are dying...Wildcard made a huge mistake on that and I have been tracking server populations and all I can say is that this server is not the only one in trouble..Far Fewer players on all unofficial servers as for official servers they still sort of busy not to the extent they where pre scorched earth but I assume those are just the alpha tribes logging in each day to check on their bases and such.Even the Scorched earth servers are somewhat dead I looked into buying it myself thinking thats where all the players went but when I tracked them over a few days even those showed little promise with low populationdead serversAll my friends who played ark have now moved onto other games another consequence for scorched earth...they couldnt be asked buying it and decided to leave instead and invest their time and money in other projects where they said they didnt feel screwed over by the wildcard.Ah wellThanks all for the fun...think I will finally go buy newest warcraft and go back to raiding in that.Peace out and cyas aroundGood luck all and thanks for your efforts in this server and past ones.Freakazoid from Dino Killers!,EnDArk,d9zr9nu,1,t5_3g0ft
