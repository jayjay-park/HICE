3422639,0,t3_2zboz7,I think part of the issue is many people generally speaking not only feel uncomfortable but dont know how to have discussions of race and privilege. It is much easier to say the past is the past or that individual acts can only be racist name calling violence etc.. The larger problem of course is that racism is more institutionalized and people still harbor hidden biases towards people of other races. Its tough to actually look in the mirror and identify our own hidden biases misperceptions and generalizations about other races. Then its a monumental leap to discuss those issues with others. Its by no means surprising but it saddens me to think in  we are still struggling with issues of race. More work must be done.,Chicano,cpiemha,1,t5_2teru
