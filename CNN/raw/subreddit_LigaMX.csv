321285,0,t3_1xn0v9,Y apenas este domingo El Ruso Garcia Aspe y El Chelis hablaban en su programa La Ultima Palabra de Fox Sports junto con Andre Marin de que Luna el que hasta entonces todavia era tecnico del Veracruz habia dado a entender que se podria ir porque segun Marin Luna dijo algo asi como que el solo era responsable de armar el cuadro pero que los jugadores eran los que jugaban.Entonces El Ruso eso lo intepreto como que Luna se estaba excusando por si lo corrian y que quiza Luna ya sabia que asi seria y que cuando el equipo va mal el tecnico se da cuenta cuando ya estan hablando con otros tecnicos en eso volteo a ver hacia El Chelis. Que quiza no podrian saber con cuales tecnicos hablaban para poder reemplazarlos pero que los tecnicos que estan en aprietos saben cuando la directiva anda buscando repuesto.El Chelis no dijo nada porque si era cierto lo que El Ruso decia pues el ya sabia que se hiria al Veracruz.Bueno en ese entonces no pense en eso pero ahora que El Chelis es el nuevo D.T. de Veracruz si se me hizo curioso. Hasta eso que cuando hablaban en otros programas de que algunos tecnicos estaban en riesgo de ser cedados El Chelis se me vino a la mente porque siempre lo contratan como el rescataequipos.,LigaMX,cfe2kt3,1,t5_2uh0l

2579781,0,t3_2pc0eh,AMRICA played to win  Tigres played not to lose.  Arroyo scores a gooddeserving gol and so does Aguilar. Its now .  Layun is brought down and it being the last defender its HAS to be a red card. Dont forget that in  Am vs Cruz Azusa a player from America was expelled for the same foul. The second red was a huge mistake by Tigres the player lost his head. No reason to swing at a player. Even if there is no contact on the punch. HE THE PLAYER made a mistake which he later apologized after the game. The third red was another dumb ass mistake by Tigres the ball was out of play and the goalie tried to take out Arroyo. Tigres lost this game and America took advantage. I wish it didnt turn out the way it did but hey Tigres fucked up. Like they did against Pachuca years ago getting three red cards in a final.

The rise of extreme politicians eg Trump or Farage in the UK is worrying but Im still hopeful.B I personally cannot accept the birthright argument. Where youre born is pure luck youve done nothing to decide where youre born. Therefore nothing should be judged upon it. You should be judged upon your skill your talent the things that youve worked so hard on. This refers to football and all jobs.

On the other hand Gignac made a great pair with Sobis and even if Sobis lacks finishing he compensated well with great assisting but its a total enigma how Gignac is gonna work with someone with a more score oriented focus if that means Aquino and Jurgen having a slightly less offensive role. The ideal formation seemed to be  Gignac alone and if Tuca plans on converting to a real  then all bets are off on whats gonna happen I hope there is no friction if Sosa starts playing alongside Gignac I would rather see Zelarayan simply substitute Sobis on the  but thats just me being risk averse heh I mean its not like we won the league.,LigaMX,d5d13yy,2,t5_2uh0l

11629601,0,t3_65y5fo,I would say mexican teams do invest a lot on academies or at least enough on them. But their purpose is to produce  or  players per year out of hundreds of players. I think what is lost is everything else thats not about money like coaching teaching systems education diet etc. There are probably a lot of people down there just going through the motions and not really adding anything to the players like it happens in big government schools.The u and u tournaments are all they have besides this kind of tournaments but it takes a lot of supervision to run a good academy because its more about the daily routines and keeping morale and intensity high than just winning matches. Also judging them by winning tournaments is kind of subjective some teams may be using younger players as a strategy to make them better not winning which would be fine by me as an owner.,LigaMX,dge87ni,2,t5_2uh0l

11742647,0,t3_67jj39,Well its a combination of things that have always given the league problems. In my opinion all teams still involved have reasons to get relegated. Puebla has ownership issues and policies that make it hard to connect to the team. Their stadium was recently upgraded yet the quality the field is just lacking. Jaguares well they should be relegated because the team is not self sufficient. If I recall there were rules to relegate teams that didnt fill their operational requirements such as paying players. Morelia has been decimated to a second fiddle team. That tv azteca owns them and took their resources to atlas is certainly not fair but it has made them into the mediocre team. Remember ho tv azteca complained so much about televisa owing necaxa and america. How necaxa was gutted just about every season to improve america. It sucked and it shouldnt happen at morelia but its obvious tv azteca just doesnt care about the team anymore. Veracruz has ownership issues that should have been solved by simply a desafiliation. People dont forget that this team has bought it way back so many times. That la piedad thing was just wrong. ,LigaMX,dgr24rf,3,t5_2uh0l

11758343,0,t3_67qmu0,Is this a good U squad? or is it one of those which the coach selected a few from his alma mater and his friends coachees? I cant find anything about where the players come from. This loss is meaningless but if the selection process is compromised I hope they deal with it now rather than after the real world cup.,LigaMX,dgsu6h4,1,t5_2uh0l
