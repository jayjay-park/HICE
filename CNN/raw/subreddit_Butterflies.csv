7904689,0,t3_4nhf1l,Baseline its a Tiger Swallowtail.... However which subspecies...? Just like uLeptotes saidYou cant see the markings  color on the hindwings well in the image because the wings are not fully open. states that for the Appalachian Tiger SwallowtailBoth forms with markedly reduced iridescent blue wash on topside of hindwings.I can see wash on the hindwing and it appears dark instead of blue like on the Eastern Tiger. Also Hindwings of males triangular.  which these appear to be in my eye.So possibly P. appalachiensis?,Butterflies,d44k9g0,1,t5_2sp0f
