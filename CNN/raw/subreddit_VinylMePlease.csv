9403864,0,t1_d9803zi,hmm looks like its only the black one.  If i remember correctly they did have the gold version up for a while so it must be gone now.  You could email someone at vinylmeplease support to know for certain tho.,VinylMePlease,d9808qe,1,t5_32c4j
10685094,0,t3_5svdec,FAQ I clicked the link but it just redirects me to the VMP homepage. Did I do something wrong?No you did not. The referral links are admittedly pretty confusing. When you click the referral link it will automatically redirect you to the homepage of their website and nothing will look different. However if the link looks something like this dont worry you did it right! Click on the join the club link at the top right of the page and then just sign up as you normally would and you will have successfully used the referral code! When signing up it asks for a referral code not a link. What is the referral code?If you signed up via a referral link you wont need a referral code to input there Im about to finish signing up but the  isnt subtracted from my total. When will that happen?The  credit to your account takes a couple days to fully process. It should be credited to your account in  to  days!,VinylMePlease,ddi34v7,1,t5_32c4j
11169376,0,t3_5yisct,Hey so Ive heard about VMP in the past and wanted to sign up but havent really had the money. Now Im thinking of doing just the  album MarchTennis but then figured it would just be cheaper to sign up for the  month membership rather than pay more later on. So if it charges  all together then why does it say itll be  a month? ,VinylMePlease,dey1cc4,1,t5_32c4j
11176195,0,t3_5ypdth,Anyone know if the Fight Club OST will be on the Pink Soap colored wax? Mondo mentioned theyd be doing a repress on their site so Im wondering if this will be part of that. ,VinylMePlease,deyt51l,1,t5_32c4j

The only other additional billing is if you wind up being lured in by their memberstore exclusives.,VinylMePlease,df67xtx,3,t5_32c4j
