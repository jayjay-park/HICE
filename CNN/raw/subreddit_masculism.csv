If you want to put rmensrights in perspective just switch the genders  all of the sudden the problems people see suddenly disappear.,masculism,cfxqrxy,2,t5_2rb6c

1635568,0,t3_2ce7oq,The article starts off saying something unsurprising sport is gendered in a male fashion. National pride and manliness and worthiness are interconnected concepts at least in the psyches of many. All agreed and no new ground is being tread.But THEN the article just gets it completely wrong. The trainwreck begins heregtIn his book on gender and sports Michael Messner writes Sport was a malecreated homosocial cultural sphere that provided men with psychological separation from the perceived feminisation of society while also providing dramatic symbolic proof of the natural superiority of men over women.gtThus football language plays on notions of masculinity and femininity activity and passivity conquest and defeat domination and submission.gtIn the World Cup with national teams playing against each other football masculinity is articulated through a sense of national identity and prowess as in the case of the BrazilGermany game. Thus the victorious German team dominated raped or overwhelmed the Brazilian one and was clearly the masculine power on the field.gtThe World Cup has come to symbolise a battlefield for nations a space where nations can play out their fantasies of domination. Therefore a defeat is so much more than just the loss in a game. As we saw in the reactions to the BrazilGermany game a loss can dismantle a nations pride and humiliate it in front of the whole world by symbolically castrating it.Just like Messner did the article conflates emasculation with feminization. As Messner conceded sport is homosocial thus both sports teams are coded as male. The castration which occurs is a loss in masculinity but this is most emphatically not equivalent to a gain in femininity. Yet again we see the traditional femmecentric dialectical pseudomonism at play femininity is presumed to be the default state which masculinity acts to differentiate itself from. This is how the article implicitly sees the gender system but does the gender system truly operate this way? Does society equate a socially castrated male with a female?Did the players on Brazils team find themselves able to use their misery to get free drinks from sympathetic men after the game?Did the players on Brazils team have their loss explained away as a product of something other than their own inadequacy?Did the players on Brazils team suddenly become protected by the injunction to never hit a girl?The symbolic rape of Brazil was not a heterosexual rape it was an homosexual rape did I just make my first attempt at Queer Theory there?. ,masculism,cjlbttq,1,t5_2rb6c

2455430,0,t1_cllcnf4,This is nonsense. Men dont kill themselves because they cant express their emotions. They kill themselves because they face incredible pressure and no one around them is sympathetic to there expression of emotions. Its not because men cant cry its because of what happens to them when they do cry. A crying woman is viewed with sympathy and support. A crying man is viewed with loathing and contempt.,masculism,cmf6yrw,0,t5_2rb6c
