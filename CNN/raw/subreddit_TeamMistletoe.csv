5663977,0,t3_3sotnl,Im a bit shorter than you but I never get hungry at  which is my current calorie intake. It also helps that I tend to eat more fat and protein  Im definitely not doing lowcarb but I would say that Im a lot more discriminating when it comes to them these days because I just dont find them as filling.But if you dont start seeing the scale go down heck even if you do you will definitely want to invest in a kitchen scale if you dont have one already to accurately measure your food. Eyeballing portion sizes is extremely difficult and even if you are using dry measurements theres still the chance of it being pretty off. ,TeamMistletoe,cwz66kw,1,t5_3afwe

5850903,0,t3_3v58uy,November had me really stressed out. I was so worried about Thanksgiving and having a lot of parties to go too. Ended up not doing much at all so I stressed myself over nothing. I made no progress. I ended November right where I started. It was rough. Just means moving forward now and not getting caught up in my own head. ,TeamMistletoe,cxmky8v,1,t5_3afwe
