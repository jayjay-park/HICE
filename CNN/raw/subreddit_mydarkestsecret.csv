2434421,0,t1_cmcldfw,Sadly many docters here also think its an STD for some reason I have asked nurses and docters I know and had to resort to the internet to find out it isnt. I have told her but she thinks Ill leave her and that I just want to have sex with her and dont respect her. I think its all excuses really. Ive been making female friends and unless she changes in the next few months not just about sex but other factors. Ill probably leave her. Not to sound mean or crazy but one of the main reasons I stick around is that Ive never been in a relationship and being with her has helped me learn a lot about being in one. ,mydarkestsecret,cmclml7,1,t5_2wuvl

Im on mobile so I cant easily link sources but you can google it.  Check out your brain on porn.  of the time it has nothing to do with men finding their partner unattractive just that their brain has been rewired to find pleasure elsewhere. ,mydarkestsecret,da4n9rh,1,t5_2wuvl
