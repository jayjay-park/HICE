11529456,0,t1_dg0ydhz,Its not just  days its up to a year if the most likely anti gun judge decides to extend it. It is based of an ACCUSATION so the accused is forced to go before that judge to try to prove themselves innocent of the accusation. And of course there is no potential for abuse here its not like an angry spouse or relative would ever lie just to screw someone.    Why just the guns? I mean why not allow someones drivers license to get yanked for  days just because some family member accused them of being mentally unstable?
