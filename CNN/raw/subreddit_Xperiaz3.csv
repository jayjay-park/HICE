2248949,0,t1_clpbkmx,I can see what youre talking about from my p desktop monitor. Thats totally normal for indoor shots taken on a smartphone. The Z uses relatively small pixels so it has to rely on algorithms to manage noise. ,Xperiaz3,clpoxqb,1,t5_30led
2268345,0,t1_cls2sfn,Ok that makes sense. Am I right in saying you can configure your phone to have a whole screen dedicated to Google Now instead of a page of apps? Ill take your word for the last bit. It seems strange to me however that even though Android is hailed for being customisable you all insist on customising it even further! ,Xperiaz3,cls35j0,1,t5_30led
2302417,0,t1_clw99mv,Honestly I got lucky..Im not even sure how I found out the sources like I did. I have been searching for the past week to see if others had the same issue. Your post was what made me dig deeper and go through the exchange. Thanks! Glad you got yours replaced. TMobile just processed my replacement.,Xperiaz3,clwanbo,1,t5_30led

2483884,0,t3_2nro18,use the  days return period and then order a new one  its the fastest wayIf you use the official sony way you might have to wait until your device is repaired,Xperiaz3,cmis5lj,2,t5_30led
2537742,0,t3_2ohpne,Just FYI I have the casemate barely there and front and back tempered glass. The case does fit but the buttons are roughly half a millimetre off centre and there isnt as much of a lip around the screen. These things cause me absolutely no issues buttons are still easily pressable and I dont really care about the lip.,Xperiaz3,cmpthuy,2,t5_30led
2556854,0,t3_2p0pb2,Yup ordered one for my Z on the th. Still havent gotten it yet. I live in Washington State. The back of my Z looks like shit now. Hella pissed off. Next time Im getting a slickwrap instead. ,Xperiaz3,cmsbh2q,7,t5_30led

2659079,0,t3_2qf76n,If you have a blotchy corner of course get it exchanged.But you should look at this sub and search battery. We get ridiculous battery life regularly. I can go two days no charge without a sweat. Stamina mode is a beast.,Xperiaz3,cn5o4ya,6,t5_30led
2802029,0,t1_cnm21hh,I have the nillkin smooth  touch or silk touch? case and I can definitely use the magnetic port. This case is great. I would highly recommend it. It makes the phone not slippery and barely adds any thickness. ,Xperiaz3,cnmkwpc,1,t5_30led

3272457,0,t1_cp0l36t,I have the TMobile one and starting to get more and more crashes. Just two days ago I received a phone call and right as I was gonna answer it bugged out and i couldnt do anything it just kept ringing until I turned it off.,Xperiaz3,cp1aca8,1,t5_30led

4101073,0,t3_37jzb8,I love root on this phone heres a list of what Ive been able to do so far Block all ads this is the best part IMO worth rooting just for this Allow full resolution on Superior Auto MP Popup videos of Twitch and YouTube multiwindow Expand all notifications Force full screen on any app I want immersive mode YouTube background playback works with screen off and in the background Move volume bar to the status bar area and make it expandable to change different volumes easily Change flashing notification LED color for different apps Clean up the lock screen remove all text and icons except widgets Change DPI to show more content on screen Use GLTools to trick my phone into thinking its Nvidia Shield to play Halflife  and Portal Remove bloat obvious Enable both speakers on incoming call And most of that is done with Xposed. Overunderclocking isnt really a thing anymore since the phone has great battery life without underclocking and overclocking doesnt help the phone become any smoother than it already is.Also you dont need root to pirate apps just FYI. If you think rooting is only good for removing bloatware and underoverclocking CPU then you are missing out. ,Xperiaz3,crnqxak,1,t5_30led

4425184,0,t1_csohbai,Yes supposedly. Not sure how you reflashed KitKat but maybe something to do with the cell radio modem not sure if you can downgrade the modem firmware. Could be wrong however.. Jus a suggestion.,Xperiaz3,csohjea,1,t5_30led

7234211,0,t1_d20emsw,It is in fact true. Period.  One thread worked for you? Good for you. You happened to be a default or expected state case. The only one the guide writer anticipated or cared about.  Id say spending hours of reading multiple threads comparing the information between them googling the differences between model variants and still softbricking my device because it was the one subvariant that fell outside the instructions qualifies me as patient. And proves my point.  Furthermore Ive had similar problems following XDA guides for my Nexus  from way back too certain prerequisites were left unstated simply assumed that the only people reading the guide would surely have known from some other source that there was some other vitally important step between  and .  ,Xperiaz3,d20h6ox,1,t5_30led

7987575,0,t1_d4ddgb3,Sure you can use the SD for as much as possible. Id recommend using it for your default storage with Marshmallow you can go in to Apps and choose to save them to the SD card. That way if your glass screen cracks and you cant do anything with the phone you will at least have most of your info backed up to the SD and can transfer it to another device. SD cards are reasonably priced I have a  GB which I find more than enough for loads of pictures and videos as well as other media. The K video wants to save to the phone itself but you can manually override that. Feel free to ask away but there are many helpful videos on YouTube. Just type in Z and the playlist will be more than enough. Enjoy!,Xperiaz3,d4dvody,1,t5_30led
