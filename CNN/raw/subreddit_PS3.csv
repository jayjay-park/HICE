21282,0,t1_cegl768,It largely depends on the game.  The biggest gains will come from games that stream a lot of data off the drive that stuff will load faster because the drive can find it quicker. think texture and object pop in This is the case in games like Final Fantasy XIV and to some extent GTAV.Most games though just do a big load at the beginning and theres not much of a difference between an SSD and a good normal hard drive.,PS3,cegutvb,1,t5_2qhhw

141877,0,t1_ceukvpk,I actually played it on PC and it was incredibly pretty on there. Ran at  fps with no issues for the entire time which is pretty impressive. I was also really impressed when I realized that there was going to be a hell of a lot more to the combat than just Ebony amp Ivory and Rebellion. It felt like the first time I played Bayonetta which I desperately wish for on PC where the complex combo system was replaced with an equally complex weapon system. I just hope that Capcom doesnt kill the reboot. Id love some more DmC maybe as Vergil this time.,PS3,ceul8x6,4,t5_2qhhw
146141,0,t3_1vpy3w,It all depends. Some people get spoiled by playing the sequel of a game before the first one and just cant bring themselves to enjoy it. I tend to keep in mind when a game was released and how many if any similar games were out at that time. I can almost always get into an older game that way. Its the reason I liked Assassins Creed  as much as I did. I didnt play the others first and I imagined what it was like playing it in    when it was released. It was repetitive but even two or three years after it came out I didnt have a game in my library that allowed me to stab so many people and jump on so many things until I played ACII that is.BL was a very big step up from  as all sequels should be. But dont go back to play the first if youre expecting a game of equal caliber. Expect the game that made the better one a possibility.,PS3,cev2ri3,2,t5_2qhhw

221851,0,t3_1wnno3,Its actually the super slim if you just picked it up. Also it plays games and Blurays. It connects to your tv with cables. And it plays PSone games. Nearly all of them. So if you have any PSone discs lying around try them out before buying the PSN equivalent because the quality is nearly identical. Also PlayStation is a musthave. If youre in NA get it now or set up the trial if your console came with it download this months games so you dont miss them and then stick around for next month and beyond. Also The Last of Us and the Uncharted series are two of my favorite exclusives but others can give you a dozen other recommendations. ,PS3,cf3pq0g,4,t5_2qhhw

I have owned a DFGT for awhile and still pull it out occasionally for Gran Turismo. I also own A Logitech G for PC Sims. I dont know how well it works on the PS Presumably fine but it is a damn good peripheral. The build quality on the wheel and pedals is very good. The Shifter isnt too shabby either. Both of Logitechs wheels are excellent and well worth the money in my opinion. It just depends how much you really want to spend.

Its not the cables its the actual insides of the PS.If it DOES work on the other Television then the issue is within the firmware of either the original TV or the PS. Though this would only happen if you had faulty custom firmware in your PS or you performed a faultybuggy firmware update on your TV if its a smartTV and made it incompatible with the PS but this is a stretch even more so since your Xbox  does work.

I did the same thing a while ago because I entered phony answersquestions to identify myself a long time ago but managed to recover the account a long time later.Im not sure for the deleting the new psn account though because I believe there must be a check between the account that bought it and the PSN Store to check if you legitimately downloaded the game to prevent piracy. Id say that you should leave the other account active and not use it if you want to keep playing Bioshock and get trophies on your main account in order to avoid content being blocked. It changes nothing whether you have one or  system accounts on the console btw just select the main one as default login when the system boots up and you wont see a difference.TLDR recover your password on your main account for future purchases and keep the newer account active to make sure the Bioshock content isnt blocked due to drm.,PS3,ch1y9q8,1,t5_2qhhw

Thats only for the GB Model that doesnt come with an HDD your PS already has one.As for backing up your data you should Copy your Saves to the Cloud with PS. Use the Backup Utility to backup all data from the PS Hard Disk Drive to an external storage device. Here are the instructions Upgrade your HDD Use the Restore Utility to restore the data to your new HDD. Delete the Backup Data on the external storage device using Delete Backup Data Utility.

The fans are probably cutting on to cool it off and when that fails it shuts down as a precaution instead of overheating to damage.  You may want to open it up and make sure the heat sink is seated properly perhaps reapply some thermal paste and make sure all if your ducts are clear for proper airflow.Again Im only speculating.

1024868,0,t1_chkrnhg,Go to the game bar and click on game data utility. Scroll down until you see Skyrim. It should be about  gigs. Dont worry it wont affect your save data. Delete it and Id delete the update as well. Boot up the game and it should install the update and the mandatory install. If that doesnt work delete both of them again and boot your PS into safe mode you should be able to find a guide easily over Google. Restore the file system and database and then boot up the game again and download the update and the install again and you should be good to go.

If its a launch model you COULD swap the mechanical part of the drives. the board on the bottom of the drive MUST STAY WITH THE ORIGINAL ps.However Id look into a slim with CFW... Notice how ps classics are available for nonBC pss? All pss have the horsepower to emulate a ps and run MOST games. Sony locks this ability so they can sell classics  the emulation software is fairly robust if you can gain access to it.Either option requires a good bit of technical knowledge though. Hopefully youll find a solution.CFW will get you banned if you play online though. I know its a sucky situation.,PS3,cn68u7m,1,t5_2qhhw

2786266,0,t1_cnks7n8,I wasnt speaking about the quality of the software Im talking about when Nintendo wasnt king and they were living in the shadows of the PS and PS regular Nintendo fans stuck with them. But the moment they got a new crowd of nongamers Nintendo dumped all their chip into the fad and left everyone burned out with the later half of Wiis life cycle. Even Nintendo wasnt winning the N or PS console wars they were still golden in the eyes of the fans.Sony is riding on the strength of people who change sides its going to bite them the minute that fanbase leaves for the next shinyshiny fad. PS is a hypebox with no games at the moment Sonys only covering their bases by regurgitating the same shit from lastgeneration and acting like this is a gift to PS owners who bought that software previously. Theres nothing good about Remasters or ports its holding nextgen back. The biggest insult how high and mighty Sony and Microsoft  were after removing backwards compatibility they downplayed its importance then immediately revert to last generation to cover their the software droughts. Look at how Sony is marketing Ultra Street Fighter  and FF ports as PS exclusives. My fucking ass they are.,PS3,cnkse90,1,t5_2qhhw
2805296,0,t3_2s7503,The original PS backward compatible PSs are getting hard to find and that original design didnt seem to hold up terribly well. I would shoot for a slim or a super slim which are still PS backwards compatible. You may even still be able to find a supper slim gb new in a store somewhere. The PS HDD should work but if you purchase a PS that did not come with a HDD then you will need to place something under the drive to support it since the caddy will not be included not an issue I did this with mine. Lastly as far as modding goes If you would like to use it online I wouldnt.

Only way to get save data is to fix the console you have. Possibly if your lucky you can insert a usb stick formatted properly and find a video of someone backing up save files and follow the exact button presses they do hopefully the menus are the same between your firmware and the video then maybe if that works your save files will be backed up to the usb stick.

4532939,0,t1_ct1z6la,not too many games from the PS era will ever truly be lost at least not anything decent. First of all most PS games are available on other platforms. The Xbox  may not be much better in terms of downloaded games but PC games are covered pretty well for future generations. Second all the good exclusives seem to get ported forward sooner or later. The Last of Us came out on PS pretty quickly and the Uncharted series is on the way. Of course this means you will have to rebuy your games but this is nothing new. People have been rebuying media for new platforms since the dawn of analog recording.

The graphics look great the characters are interesting and the storyline is very good not corny at all.  Yeah there are corny bits but unlike most a lot of RPGs given the world the story sets up it actually makes sense.  Definitely give it a go the game draws the player in pretty quickly too.

City does a great job at expanding on the first and adding new gameplay elements.  City also has a more refined combat system which if you go back and play Asylum after you might get annoyed with its initial combat system.  With that said though I personally still liked Asylum better because it just seemed to flow together a lot better and City seemed to be a cluttered story line where they couldnt decide on which villains they wanted to use so they just threw in everybody at some point though that idea does go with what the definition of Arkham City is supposed to be as a place.,PS3,cvcl8zq,8,t5_2qhhw

Personally I hate everything pokemon but still enjoyed this game.If you like oneonone fighting games BlazBlue is a beautiful and completely hand drawn but Id say pretty hard to master. More cartoony style youll find in the LEGO titles which seem pretty good and obviously dont have a  rating. The Mass Effect trilogy is also amazing and I believe those are around the  age rating despite having some romance dialoguecutscenes but these are easily avoided.

The only possibility you have is if you took out your initial harddrive. There may be some way to get it transferred to an external harddrive at a local computer shop not even sure that would work. Then reload it after you have a new hard drive in the playstation itself. If you did take out the harddrive with all your info on it DO NOT PUT IT BACK INTO THE PLAYSTATION. IT WILL BE REFORMATTED AND YOULL LOSE EVERYTHING FOR GOOD. The backup and restore of data is actually pretty easy. It will take forever if you have a full drive tho.

6199615,0,t3_40i0ju,Is this really the full list? If so that would suck if they dont even have all their exclusives on it. Since you like creative games I am going to recommend some Sony exclusives and you can see if they have them Little Big Planet Series Puppeteer Flower Flw Journey Ratchet amp Clank seriesAnd even though you may not really care for Shooters you should take a look at Uncharted and Last of US.Hope there is something that is also available on playstation now.Also as someone who plays since the Atari days if you like what you see on PS Now a PS would be a great investement. I ofc dont know how your family situation is and if you only get h playtime a week in I understand not picking up another console but you really shouldnt limit yourself to just Nintendo anymore.  Dont get me wrong I love my Wii U and also DS but the PS has so many weird quirky and creative games that its really a great console to pick up now considering how cheap most games are basically all the great games are around  bucks. Sony gives studios really a lot of freedom when it comes to being creative and the few games I just mentionend show that probably especially Journey. But also indie games like Brothers A tales of two Sons or games from rd parties like Valiant Hearts or Child of light from Ubisoft for example are great and creative games. Also if you like JRPGs there are a ton of them available as well which is a genre basically non existent on the Xbox  for example The PS has really a lot to offer and still much more than the PS currently has for example so if you ever think of adding another console the PS is a great idea considering how many exclusives it has.,PS3,cyubvx2,3,t5_2qhhw

7390682,0,t3_4ginbk,Im not saying its impossible but this is going to be orders of magnitude more work than even a PS emulator. You have to realize that the PS is to oversimplify it basically a PC with cores for computing game data and then an th core devoted to just UI. The way it delegates tasks to each core isnt consistent and so youre not just looking at translating the language or instruction set the instructions for the CPU are written in for a single core chip youre talking about having to do that whole making all  cores work in sync to accurately emulate the code running in a stable manner. So even if you have an core PC theres still the overhead of having to translate instructions from the PowerPC instructions to xIntel. ,PS3,d2i9qkn,10,t5_2qhhw

The combat is kinda like Dark Souls but certain attacks use stamina and basic attacks dont. Huge open world.

9972452,0,t1_db79lv7,Component can do p but the signal is analog instead of digital like with the hdmi. Like what was said before analog signals can very depending on the cord quality and length plus hardware. Hdmi cables either work or dont with  a small margin where you get white speckles from a bad signal. If your tv has a slow analog converter then you may have more input lag vs digital. Thats why framemeister box is touted. It takes that analog signal cleans it up upscales it and can set it to the resolution the tv can natively take. Doing that cuts down on the tv having to process the signal very much and reduces input lag on newer tvs. Hope that helps. ,PS3,db7frf9,6,t5_2qhhw

Tools of Destruction and A Crack in Time are also fantastic games and must have titles.If you like platformers theres a ton on Sony systems.  Sly Cooper Collection Spyro the Dragon PS Original Trilogy Puppeteer  LittleBigPlanet  Ape Escape Jak amp Daxter Collection people are pretty split down the middle about Jak II but everybody seems to unanimously love the first game and agree  is better than II.Id say hold off on Crash until the PS remaster.My other favorite recommendation to give is the Yakuza series. Very overlooked but its getting a lot of attention with the recent release of Yakuza . A great place to start but the bulk of the series is on PS. Gran Turismo  is my favorite racing game on the system worth picking up for sure if you have any interest in racing sims.But really the PS just destroys the  in terms of exclusive library size. A ton of gems to be found on PS its incredible and I urge you to explore the depths of the library to find interesting experiences. Plus as others have said the games are very reasonably priced right now for the most part. ,PS3,dd2a153,1,t5_2qhhw

10583158,0,t1_dd77273,Vue?  Do you mean PS Now?  Anyway I dont see how either are related to this months games.LBP has been cheap for a while but at least on the surface they can say This is a full first party AAA title.  Personally Im happy with the choice because I have the first two games on PS and I wasnt going to buy LBP anytime soon.  PS players also have four other games offered if you consider cross buy.  Thats like a dollar per game whereas PS is . per game.  Im not really one to complain about PS though.  I play enough online games to make it worth it.,PS3,dd7kkk6,6,t5_2qhhw

10849468,0,t3_5v3pkn,Theres no real way to tell. The reviews are not specific about this either but very vague and kind of unconvincing. The price seems to be lower than Ive seen them go for used and its claiming theyre sealed which could mean they are new or just resealed used. I just picked up a DS used from a gaming shop for  a couple weeks ago and Ive seen them online for that price or even as low as  brand new occasionally so Im wary of the  price tag. Also I cant even tell from the site or listed model  if these are later revision models or the lower battery capacity original DSs. Assuming they are real it could be random whether you get a revision or original. The gaming shop I got my current DS offered me an low capacity one first and I had to ask specifically for a revision as thats what I was attempting to replace. Truthfully its a gamble with this site. If you do decide to risk it take pics of it make sure to get the information on the back of the controller that contains modelrevision info for us and we should be able to tell you either way then. ,PS3,ddz1nxg,2,t5_2qhhw

11163805,0,t3_5zdury,All the Ratchet and Clank games that a few people have mentioned particularly Crack in Time but Tools of Destruction and Quest for Booty were good too though they didnt have trophies. You can also get the original RampC   and  games remastered for PS now.The first two inFAMOUS games.Arkham Asylum. Personally I didnt like Arkham City much and havent really played Arkham Knight but the first game was really fun.Little Big Planet.Just Cause . The story was boring but the open world gameplay was great way better than  in my opinion. Just dont try to platinum it unless you have a lot of time on your hands.Red Dead Redemption I dont think this has been remastered but Im not sure.Edit just read the whole description and realised you wanted PS exclusives.

11188848,0,t1_df02qom,Dont get me wrong Im a huge metal gear fan and having played the rest of the games I would obviously never skip them myself. But if youre just looking for a good PS game and know absolutely nothing about MGS then I cant imagine how confusing a lot of the story related ones would be especially with Big Mama and the very very end at the graveyard. But if OP wants to watch then they certainly should. ,PS3,df08qwc,2,t5_2qhhw

11307559,0,t1_dfdk2x1,Its great for family play. Most of the games involve drawing or filling in blanks so its definitely suitable for all ages because the game only gets as dirty as you wanna make it.

Then when I get to the title screen of a game it turns off again does it like  times before I can actually play. Then like sometimes when Im playing a long session it just turns off again.
