2794477,0,t3_2s16v9,All you can do is continue to tune into who youre attracted to. I was the same way always had crushes on guys. Didnt totally recognize that at the time but later when I accepted my sexuality I understood it clearlyI liked guys. I also had experiences with women over the years but guys are what I was and am drawn to. In the end it really doesnt matter what you are... it only matters that youre happy. And you will only be happy if you allow your heart to take you where it wants to go without denying yourself of your desires. Be who you want to be. Present yourself however youd like people to see you. Date someone who accepts you just the way you are and loves everything about you. That is the recipe for happiness.I know thats hard to do in high school but the sooner you follow that the better off youll be. Dont worry about serious relationships right now focus on yourself and find people to date and have fun with. Find people who will shed light on who you are and allow you to understand yourself better. Try to enjoy your journey of discoverydont be stressed out by it. Most people dont have the option of experiencing this so consider yourself lucky. In time and through experience you will find out what moves you and you will understand who you are more and more as the years go by.,questioning,cnlpzha,1,t5_2rt8z

4327375,0,t3_35paum,This is so weird because your post literally sound like I could have written it. Down to the father saying that all gays should be shot and just wanting someone to goddamn decide because Im just so tired about thinking about it and just want to move on with my life without the burden of uncertainty about my identity weighing down on me.Since Im in the same quandary right now as Im typing this I dont have much advice to give. I am writing to let you know that you are not alone at all.,questioning,csdfa9l,1,t5_2rt8z

5122914,0,t1_cv38zal,Thank you Yes I guess telling someone doesnt need for me to marry or girl or anything like that. It doesnt make me obligated to do anything.I just feel telling that to my family would be kind of hard for them to understand after me dating men for years and never bringing anything about that to them.Thank you really its just small simple answers for you but it really helps,questioning,cv3i4eo,1,t5_2rt8z
5496784,0,t3_3qdgbs,Howdy! Im a trans lady who started out her questioning with this NOPE. FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS DUDE SHIT feeling and anything else would suffice. That was two years ago and Im still only  sure that Im outwardly representing how I feel inside. My advice is simple but difficult to follow. Try everything that you can. Try absolutely anything. If you think about it and it isnt going to kill you do it. If you dislike it stop. Everyone is different and you should find you. theres a million resources I could give you if youd like. ,questioning,cwe9lix,2,t5_2rt8z

6992842,0,t3_48do59,Not an expert but Ill try my best to give you my view on it. Basically you can call yourself whatever the hell you want and if androgynous seems good to you then go for it. Youre happy with your boyfriend and thats all that matters there really. I expect that he would be supportive and accepting if you spoke to him about it. If you dont feel comfortable in womens clothing  dont wear it! If you dont feel comfortable with the term woman dont use it! Speak to your boyfriend about him not calling you beautiful or anything thats uncomfortable for you. If hes supportive of that then great if not then you deserve someone better so it wouldnt matter that he didnt take it well.  Other than that you seem to have this pretty well under control. You know what you like and what you dont and so just stick with that. Im guessing most of your relatives would call you a tomboy if they had to describe you as androgynous isnt too common of a word outside of the LGTBetc I apologise if I missed any letters but you all know what I mean community but that doesnt matter too much as long as your comfortable and happy with how you describe yourself if that makes sense?.Hopefully this was somewhat helpful and Im terribly sorry it took so long. Normally this site has far quicker responses but I havent been able to get on much recently and not everyone feels comfortable answering these questions I think Im guessing mainly because they dont feel qualified to do so same!. But if there is anything else direct message me dont even know if thats a thing not been on here enough and such or reply to this and Ill get back to you eventually!,questioning,d18zby4,1,t5_2rt8z
8668987,0,t3_4yjtiv,F I would not expect someone of your age to feel much down there in response to anything I did not in response to normal sexual imagery and I wouldnt today.I was also very confused about my sexuality when I was around . Ever since I was a very little kid I have had a very weird and intense sexual fantasy involving other women and I mean REALLY weird but Im not going to go into details because youre a minor!. But other than that I regard myself as interested in men. Its funny that Im not otherwise interested in doing sexual things with women at all. I have had strong romantic feelings for a few women in the past and learnt through that that it is possible to feel romantic love for somebody without being at all interested in having sex with them. Because of those weird exceptions to my straightness I dont call myself either straight bisexual or anything else and Ive come to feel fine about that. Theres a great quote from Walt Whitman with regard to these things Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. I am large I contain multitudes.I would strongly recommend however keeping away from porn until youre at least . Being exposed to a lot of porn from the age of about  only made me worry and preoccupy about my sexuality so much more and put other peoples overthetop stereotypical and violent images of what sex is or should be like in my head rather than letting me use my own imagination and explore my own unique feelings. Written stuff like fanfiction is OK because you can visualise it yourself and because it typically explores relationships at least a little bit realistically but I found visual pornography to be harmful to me.Best wishes.,questioning,d6p8s4f,1,t5_2rt8z
9063747,0,t1_d80wqjj,Not a problem Im glad the post is long. My crossdressing also started somewhat early after wearing a long blue dress that was hanging in my room at my dads house out of curiosity what it would be like. Im sorry you had to experience such an empty feeling. I know I have wondered what it would be like but I couldnt imagine wishing every day to wake up different. Im glad you are feeling better about it. Its possible that mine started as a mild curiosity and only escalated to this point later on but Im not sure if it would be possible to separate the two unless I was able to dress for long periods of time and even then I suspect the urges wouldnt go away just by separating them if they are a part of my sexuality and not just a result of regular use of that type of porn. ,questioning,d81bdvx,1,t5_2rt8z
11155487,0,t3_5z9tq4,I just read over this and realized how insane I sound. Im sorry Ive calmed down a bit but I hope you can read through the despair. I dont know if this is all depression as most people in my life say Im experiencing but it feels like despair to the point that I dont want to breathe sometimes. I just want to be free and not feel all of the panic and disgust Ive recently started feeling with myself since this panic stage of my life began.,questioning,dewgo2x,1,t5_2rt8z
