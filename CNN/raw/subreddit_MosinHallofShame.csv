3787599,0,t1_cqnzv4g,I bought it. Im currently planning to either put it into M configuration  The only qualm I have about that is I only have the sellers word about the original configuration and I dont want to make something that was never an M into an M. Also M stocks are very hard to find. The other option Im considering is to try configuring it similarly to either the M or the . Tkiv . I doubt Ill be able to match either gun but I might be able to get something comparable. EDIT Im normally something of a purist but with an already destroyed gun Im willing to experiment a little.,MosinHallofShame,cqo0loo,2,t5_353z7
