This is due to the fact that I just discovered it TODAY. I discovered TDH when Act III was released and fell in love with their sound. But since I listen to SO much music on Spotify I just forgot to follow them since Migrant was released. I was just notified by a friend that they had one of the best albums of the year and I couldnt believe I had let it slip thru the cracks.

8047845,0,t3_4pbnoy,Long time theory Ive had since about  and its looking very possible. So as we all know the flame is gone the fire remains as used in act  represents the boys father leaving him and Ms Terry him being the flame the boy being the fire. Now I predict that the Boys life will begin to mirror his fathers and that before he left for the war Ms Leading got pregnant with his child. Then the boy leaves he becomes the Flame and his son is now the Fire. They meet again in act V after an untimely demise of Ms Leading and I think the Boys son will eventually lead to his death the same way the Boy killed his own father,TheDearHunter,d4knj66,3,t5_2st9u

9383366,0,t1_d91vyd0,Ive been listening to Closure in Moscow after your recommendation and they are spectacular. They sound a lot like Circa Survive which I love because they are one of my favorites. All of the others Ill listen to soon because you named a bunch haha.The funny thing about Art By Numbers is that I just found them out the day before this post and I really like their stuff too. Their album says that its a musical but I havent figured out the story yet if there is even one.Okay I dont know what youve already reviewedlistened to but here are some suggestions anyway no particular order Dear and the Headlights  I love them to death and they probably are in my top . In the only two albums theyve made I have yet to find a song with a flaw. The lyrics are great and the acoustic feel makes it accessible to everyone imo. If you liked Yellow and Green from TCS you would definitely like them. Dont expect any more from them though they broke up years ago sadly The Decemberists  Youve probably heard of them by now if you constantly go on this sub and for good reason. Their music has such a unique feel from most folk artists today due to the singers voice and the musical accompaniment of accordions strings and brass. Most of their songs contain their own uncorrelated story which you would enjoy if you like story driven songs like from TDH. Take a gander at Picaresque my fav album from them Picturesque  If you like ABN you might enjoy these guys. Picturesque has a Pierce the VeilSleeping With Sirens vibe but I find the singer more pleasing. Paper Rival SelfTitled Album  A combo of DATH and As Tall As Lions. Their selftitled album is probably my favorite from them. Panic! At the Disco A Fever You Cant Sweat Out  This recommendation might be a stretch because of the genre change. These guys are fairly poppunk but their first album had a very burlesques Victorian vibe to it which I found amazing. They are also very theatrical much like Act II in a way. Theyre one of my favorites but I dont know if you would like their most recent stuff because it is fairly popy. If you like it I would also recommend their next album Pretty. Odd. Beatles vibes from this one. Death Cab for Cutie  Pretty solid moody sound. Great for long car rides whilst staring out the window. Modest Mouse  Dont know how to describe them. They mustve been on drugs but most of their stuff I found to be pretty good. Try listening to The Best Room one of my favorites from them. Portugal. The Man  Psyyychadeliiicc. Theyre basically really mellow and I mean really mellow. Popy but enjoyable I believe.Really sorry about that I cant really condense my thoughts well haha! Hope you find some enjoyment from these and thanks for your suggestions. ,TheDearHunter,d95eoou,1,t5_2st9u

9533651,0,t3_5b3dp1,I think it represents an existential crisis it first appears in the end of A Night on the Town in which he drinks with the halfbrothers friends  and they think he is the half brother and after having some issues not recognizing them he sees Ms. Leading again. He realises that becoming the halfbrother and dismissing his past life would be harder than he thought.The second time the theme appears of course is Wait which is Hunter and Ms. Leading pretty much saying we are awful people.The third time is between The Haves Have Naught and Light this is the time Hunter decides to send his wife and son back to the lake because he is concerned for their safety after meeting Mr. Usher.The fourth time the theme appears is in The March The Pimp and Priest sends everyone after Hunter and he has to decide whether he would give in to the Pimp and Priest and the crowd or just end it all which he does by killing the Pimp and Priest and then himself.Its just my opinion based mostly on the info released from the story time answers hope you like it.,TheDearHunter,d9o8032,3,t5_2st9u

10502457,0,t1_dcyjz9w,Not enough considering how this is by far the most info on the EP in existence. XD I really loved all three songs. Isabella has a lot more power than Is There Anybody Here? to me seeing as how it feels like youve sung the chorus with an amazing amount of angst for the lack of a better word. And I actually like Owls in a silly but in keeping company sort of way. Its funny but so is King of Swords Reversed and both arent halfbad at all. So long to those other tracks I suppose. Though those crowds you played for werent the greatest I do encourage you to revisit the EP. Like a diamond in the rough. And if something similar happens in this Neverender tour just remember that Claudio can use his helicopterhair to fly down next to you and take a swing or two at the audience with his Welcome Home guitar. I do encourage you to revisit the songs that youve met similar ire with so you can overcome such memories. Believe it or not this EP has actually been praised in this sub in your absence. Those are the fans whom you shouldve played B. Linus for. Thanks for the EP even if it wasnt intended for the rest of us. Ill still listen to it. Sorry for talking too much.
