10142762,0,t1_dbtdeu8,There was no bashing. It was only offered that people DO suffer from this and it involves very extreme behavior. If this wasnt a grand conspiracy for profit and you have to explain Sherris willingness to harm herself in order to gain attention and have power over her family read this description from the National Institutes of Health and see that there are conditions that explain such a willingness. It was merely being offered as one possible explanation if Sherri started this alone or inflicted her own wounds by people who have had experience with people who exhibit this behavior which does not stem from normal thinking.,thepapinis,dbtltz1,4,t5_3i7pf

Shipley basically verifies that CGs certificates arent forged while Shipley just asks what the certificates mean rather than actually verify that those certificates mean what CG says they mean. For instance CG claims that based on his certificates that hes a subject matter expert on all things captivity including negotiations but Shipley apparently did nothing to verify that CG is actually a qualified ransom negotiator.,thepapinis,dc8pnsn,5,t5_3i7pf

In addition we informed them that if the thread was deleted and they later found verification we would open a new one for them. After stating they would look for something we never heard back. If we had not handled it that way each moderator would have spent many more hours glued to the screen incessantly refreshing to make sure no one steps out of line not referring to our regulars who are absolutely lovely.

10654671,0,t3_5s7wd6,As expected CG reinforced the narrative that he formulated with Don Shipley YTs.   He said in the DS tapes that neither him nor his wife had ever had communication with the Ps before November .  On the video he plays a message purported to be LJs initial request of him.He is either telling the truth or he is telling the big lie and reinforcing it by repeating his well developed narrative over and over.  He might be gambling that that KPs narrative and his narrative will stick if they repeat it enough through enough media outlets and the Sheriff will just let the whole thing wither rather than press a conspiracy case.  I still suspect he could be in this thing up to his eyeballs.I think its still just one hell of a coincidence that the SP abduction was just like Project Taken  with even KP using the word taken instead of abducted.  He just happens to live in the same town.  He injected himself into this and is really trying to play the hero.Perhaps Project Taken which he had spent quite a lot of money producing had gone nowhere since .  Although CG made money through the Bethelites and some money through his trainings doesnt it cost a lot to rent a ranch and doesnt he have  kids.  And he was being sued and didnt seem to have insurance and the settlement could run into the  figures.  Just saying that there might have been a strong money motivation to capitalize on the original Project Taken by taking it from the virtual world into the real world.One thing that I took out of the Shipley YTs was when he wanted to up the reward to k he ask KP if he could use the k GFM money to add to the AD k and KP agreed.  Didnt RR say that they had already spent a good deal of that money on PIs?  Didnt CG say in the past that the AD had agreed to up the ransom to k.  I suspect CG was playing fast and loose with that ransom money if there ever was any.  KP has a close friend who could have been the friendly banker.   ,thepapinis,ddey46z,2,t5_3i7pf

I was obsessed with the siege of East Aleppo and all of the propaganda in the Western press against the Syrian government and their allies taking back that city.  The battle for Aleppo was over at the end of December so I had an opening for a new obsession.   From all of the photos of the Ps released I just see them as posers and believe the reality of their life is far from the fairy tale they try to project.  I get a vibe from her that she is a wack job and him that he is a rube although it may be unfair because its just from the pictures of them and reading about them.I also am a serious skeptic and usually dont believe the official narrative for anything.  That includes Boston Marathon Bombing the Orlando nightclub shootings and the San Bernardino mass murder.

Drinking martinis smoking MJ to relax after their hard day of success laughing and enjoying the late afternoon. Eventually and without doubt turns into an angry argument. Adult arguments...yelling screaming banging kitchen cabinet doors and pots amp pans all to make a point...scary shit. Dinner half ass served parents pissed off SP being yelled at for no other reason other than shes in the way of their anger. She learns to retreat away from their anger and lives her teen years on egg shells around them. She learns to become sneaky. Not that she is doing anything wrong but afraid she may become their focus of anger. So...she becomes perfect and sneaky. She cant be relaxed and genuine because she simply doesnt no what that is.
