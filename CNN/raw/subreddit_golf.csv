30701,0,t3_1ugtn4,Ive always used a soft case and have never had a problem even though it always makes me nervous. My apartment doesnt have much storage space so the soft shell is a plus because it can be folded up when I dont need it. Obviously the hard case provides more protection but Ive never used one so I cant say whether its more of a hassle when dealing with the airport. For example is a hard case potentially too big to fit into the trunk of a car like a bag of clubs typically would? Thats happened to me a couple of times with the soft shell but its not hard to just take my bag out of the shell and fold the shell up next to it. ,golf,cehxe2o,3,t5_2qhcs

161491,0,t3_1vwn1d,There are a few problems there but you really have some potential. First thing I would say is youre a little disconnected in your takeaway and back swing. You want to take the club away with the turning of your upper body then fold in naturally. Also your grip is very very strong ie your hands are more underneath the shaft which is going to greatly affect how you take the club back. Youre a little steep at the top and come down slightly across the line which is probably a result of the previous comments plus the impulse to hit at the ball. Its very hard to give you constructive advice without being there with you. All I would say is try to bring your hands up on top of the club a little more so you can see  to   knuckles on your left hand at address. Take the club back nice and smooth and the most important thing is dont jerk the club down from the top of your swing. Let your arms fall naturally as you turn back to the ball once your hands get in front of your right hip you should still have a  degree angle between the club and your hands. If you do this you will hit it loooong and straight. This is the hardest thing to do to resist the impulse to hit at the ball. Trust me gravity will give you all the power you need. Talk to some local golfers and get them to recommend a good instructor you will save years of hacking balls on the range trying to do it yourself. ,golf,cewtruw,1,t5_2qhcs

179801,0,t3_1w5nqz,First off youve got to understand why you pull. Could be a few things. Are you aimed that way unknowingly? Maybe you actually dont need to change your swing?Assuming youre aimed squarely you pull the ball because your clubface is closed at impact relative to the target. The ball starts its initial launch about  where the face is pointed. So its enough without getting to technical that we can just say it starts where the face is pointed. The ball will curve based on the path of your club head. A straight pull means face and path matches each other. ,golf,ceywy0b,2,t5_2qhcs

Its just not something that I agree with and will not be teaching my students. I teach having the same width stance throughout the irons and the ball stays in the middle.

The grind on the bottom means a lot more and you should get one to fit your swing style. As always lie is important as well. Check out Scratch Golf and read up under their tech talk for everything and more you wanted to know about wedges. Somewhere on their sit you can go through a few questions and have it give you a best guess as to what would fit you for a grind.

The good thing about Myrtle is that theres golf to be had no matter where youre staying. . .you dont NEED to drive  minutes to the other end of town if you dont want.My course recommendations would be the Barefoot courses in the north favorites are Dye and Love Pine Lakes in central MB and TPC or Caledonia or True Blue in the south.  There are plenty of other great courses though but these are my favorites from what Ive played.,golf,cfibyea,1,t5_2qhcs

392356,0,t1_cflfgt0,Basically to score in match play you have to complete a hole with a lower score than your opponent. Unlike skins where a tie is added to the value of the next win in match play you just keep going until the round is over and someone has a higher score. So a tied hole means nothing youre just one closer to the end.So what happened in this scene is that on a previous hole Sergio had spent a lot of time with a rules official about relief with his chip because bees were swarming around his ball. He felt bad about that and decided to just concede the long putt to Rickie since Sergio was already up  holes on him and that putt could easily end up costing Rickie another hole. Rickie in return conceded Sergios for the gesture. Since both players were lying the same no harm done Rickie gets the better end of the deal move on to the next hole.,golf,cflfmhb,12,t5_2qhcs

415423,0,t3_1yu36z,One of the most iconic and copied par threes of all time the Redan was originally build to be played with a long iron or fairway wood. Currently today the original Redan at North Berwick plays at  yards.During the golden age it was relatively common to have a wide range of par three lengths from short irons and wedge shots up to long irons and fairway woods. Shots of either length were designed to test the players accuracy at hitting the appropriate shot into the green. Over time holes like the ones youve listed as well as holes like the th at Merion th at troon th at Cypress Point etc have been able to play the same as they still demand a precisely hit short iron or wedge. But with the distance gain in the long game the long par threes of yesterday have not been able to keep their teeth as players are no longer forced to hit long irons and fairway woods into them. This has changed the strategy of the holes and long par threes of the Redan and Biarritz design rarely play as intended.As the average player began to hit the ball farther and farther the very long par three was nearly eliminated from new course construction due to the amount of extra land needed to build it as well as its loss of strategic intent. As the ability for the average golfer to hit a precise fairway wood has as well diminished. To match many of the early  yard long par threes from the golden age a modern course would require a par three of between  and  yards. ,golf,cfntop0,4,t5_2qhcs

587617,0,t1_cg6wsbc,i agree with this I started in December with some lessons and i am already shooting under   did a   today for  holes. Lessons help out a ton. I started with my PW and  iron. learned how to create lag and worked my way back.  I have played a lot of courses around my town and still havent used my woods or drivers. I stick to my  iron and still am shooting very well.  so it seems  I did buy a  degree wedge tho. Im a sucker for high loft when im next to the green.,golf,cg72e3f,1,t5_2qhcs

591711,0,t1_cg7gm4b,Yeah Im realizing I need more range time. With two young kids at home and a working wife I rarely take the time to leave my kids for golf maybe  rounds of  holes last year. So when I do take an hour or two away from home I usually play  instead of hitting the range. I didnt play my driver for  months last year because of how inconsistent I was. I finally went to the range last month and took time to try to fix my drive and was able to straighten it out pretty nicely still only about yrds.  I think if I do some more range time I can certainly work on my lag and getting more power. Im just too afraid to try to fix it on course which is where I spend all of my golfrelated time. ,golf,cg7j4x1,1,t5_2qhcs

618977,0,t3_218kph,Having played WeKoPa and the TPC courses on a prior visit WeKoPa is gorgeous but HARD. A  handicap there which I was at the time likely wont break . However it may remain the most beautiful course Ive ever played so I cant recommend against it!The TPC layouts are more staid affairs. Theyre not particularly visually stunning theyre to be played so you can say you played where the pros play. Theyre also not all that brutal which is why the pros eat the Stadium course alive and not entirely inappropriate for a handicap.I would really recommend a trip to Troon North. The course is also beautiful but not as brutal as WeKoPa. Its also an interesting tour of desert architecture WeKoPa has no homes but Troon has a light speckling of lovely estates alongside the fairways and greens. Troon was probably the best balance of difficulty and grandeur.,golf,cgammwa,1,t5_2qhcs

Since you are not compressing the ball yet get lessons first. Dont even waste time on new irons until you are.

There are people of all types at the golf course. You cant really teach people to be more sociable.

927187,0,t3_24qc6y,I dont know England but I live in Seattle and Im under the impression that the weather is similar. The most important rain gear is your attitude. If you have it in your head that a steady rain means you should stay inside then you are going to play a lot less golf.I probably play  of my rounds with some amount of rain and I will say that most of the time I dont bother with any rain gear. It just doesnt make a large enough difference.Beyond that I recommend the following    One fully waterproof rain jacket. Water resistant isnt good enough where I live.    One rain resistant rain jacket with removable sleeves.    One pair of rain pants.    Several pairs of woolwoolblend hiking socks.    Two pairs of waterproof golf shoes.    One waterproof bucket hat.    One pair of allweather gloves.The other thing I would recommend is getting halfadozen dish towels and a couple large ziploc bags. Leave half of them at the clubhouse and pick them up at the turn so that you have some dry towels for the back nine.

1153616,0,t3_27c50q,You have a very active body during the takeaway and backswing. If you pause at  you can see your left heel off the ground your left knee way inside and the left arm collapsing. From that position it is going to be really hard to return the club face to impact position in a powerful and efficient manner.Try to lead the backswing with your handsarms while keeping your lower body fairly quiet. The hips will eventually rotate and reach an angle of  degrees while the shoulders keep turning til your back faces the target. Ideally you do not want your heels to come off the ground as this is where power comes from. You build it from the ground up in that sequence handsarms shoulders hips knees feet. The opposite sequence starts the downswing.Also hard to tell from the video but you could be coming over the top easier to determine with your ball flight.

1163765,0,t3_27eq79,I can somewhat understand why so many people are in such a rush on the course but they definitely shouldnt be. Most people are very concerned with whatever they have to do after or they feel the need to be playing at a certain speed. So many golfers are so concerned with pace of play that they will happily not play the game by the rules or they will leave a ball searching golferfriend behind. If people were more concerned with playing the game by the rules or enjoying each others company and less concerned with leaving the course in a timely fashion Id bet that there would be a lot more single digit handicappers in this world. I try to enjoy being on the course every time... Fast play slow play whatever. Pace concerned people all seem to love to complain about things. People also love to have an excuse of why they played so poorly. What most people who concern themselves with pace on course have a hard time realizing is that their actionsattitude only compounds the problem. An angryupsetrushed golfer usually plays worse and takes longer. It also effects the people around themI know a lot of you have felt the arms folded gaze of the group behind and rushed a shot or two because of it. If you cannot commit a half of a day to the game you probably shouldnt play that day. Golf is a long game enjoy it regardless of how fast you play and one last thing...putt everything out.

Stretches using a golf club or yard stick to move the left arm around in all directions with the stick powered by the right arm helped me to feel like it was healing faster and properly.  Eventually the pain subsided but crept back up this February keeping me from playing in early spring.  When I finally bucked up and went to the doc he said its arthritis now probably caused by it never healing fully because it was not treated properly.  Ill need an antiinflammatory and PT but it will never be  again.Learn from my mistake.  Go and get proper treatment from the start.

1405979,0,t3_2a8d28,So I am a stickler on score.  I want to know where I stand.  ALWAYS. So knowing that here is a good lesson for you at my expense.I played a course down the road from me.  Lived here for  years never played it.  My neighbors and I have talked about going golfing together for years and never have.  Finally  we both pulled in drive ways at same time started talking set plans to go at  next morning.  Me  my buddyneighbor  and other neighbor mid s and his friend mid sWe get there tee off and I am lining up nicely I am a  or so handicap.  I have a  yard chip onto the green.  Well I burn it long and hard and is clearly going off the other side of the green.  My neighbors friend sticks his foot out and stops my ball.  I yell  NOOOOO!  Not mean but basically indicating I wanted him to let it go.  He felt really bad and we dont really know each other yet.  Now I am used to playing everything as it is.  I dont want easy way out.  How do you get better at chipping?  By chipping?  His way of playing is he is retired goes out casually and just has fun.  I quickly realized no body was keeping score.  This is the first time I didnt.  Everyone got along great but you have to try and read who your golfing with.  I also think this is why people suggest going with different people but the dynamics really change and it seems like a whole new game again.  It was a lot of fun and stress free.  just not for me ,golf,cisipmc,1,t5_2qhcs

If youre stopping at a  iron probably  depending on brand then a  degree hybrid will be perfect for you. you probably dont need a  degree especially if you have a  wood which is probably in the  degree range.Edit One thing Id strongly recommend is that before you go out and spend money on new clubs is to find out exactly what you have. Create a google doc spreadsheet that has the club loft and shaft flex so you know what are the gaps youre trying to fill. Id also review your existing clubs and make sure youre using stuff that fits your game.,golf,ciyamd3,1,t5_2qhcs

1521163,0,t3_2bm6u0,Are you talking about full shots or are you talking about like  yard shots?  The key to these type of shots is to do whatever is easiest.  Youd be amazed how easy  yard bunker shots are when you stop trying to hit a sand wedge and instead go for a Pitching wedge or  iron and just bump it out like a long chip.  Obviously you have to give yourself room for the ball to roll out but this shot will be your goto shot when you need a lowrisk option.  On a shot that is closer to the green dont be afraid to club up to hit longer explosions.  Ill go all the way up to like a  iron so that I dont have to carry the ball all the way to the hole.  If you learn how to hit  explosion shot you can just replicate it with all your wedges and irons to get many different shots.  This is also much lower risk than trying to fly a  to the hole from every distance and has about the same reward.  You obviously need good bunker technique to pull any of this off though which is up to you to learn. I play all of these shots about the middle of my stance mayber a tad back if Im trying to clip the ball and let it run to the green.   ,golf,cj6ye4e,1,t5_2qhcs

1525051,0,t3_2bouhc,You need to get to the course  minutes prior to the first tee time. Watch the guys on the range. Watch the first group tee off and walk to their shots. Watch them hit from the fairway and then wait and watch the second group tee off hitting it basically at you because you are still beside the fairway. Then watch their approach and watch their putt. Continue this. The key isnt walking everywhere to catch up its letting them hit to you. If its the weekend doing this should result in seeing the last groups last  holes but you get to see everyone. We usually stop at a par  around hole  and eat because there is a lot of action. Another great thing to do is stand behind the green on a par  with them hitting straight at you. Avoid the tiger crowd. Just let them go through.,golf,cj7fxfz,2,t5_2qhcs

1536281,0,t1_cj8rwlu,The putter choice was a pretty bad one.  Like the commentators Im at a loss as to why more pros dont bump with a mid iron.  I love to grip way down on a  or  iron and give it a putter stroke.  Its almost impossible to miss hit and getting a feel for the weight doesnt take much practice.  Its almost always  air  skip and  roll and is highly repeatable.  In this case it would have needed a bit more due to the large uphill but not nearly as much as the putter needed.  Its much easier to control distance than a huge putter stroke since you dont have to swing so wildly.,golf,cj8ujzp,2,t5_2qhcs

1551357,0,t3_2c0amn,I really dont think that has as much to do with quality as you think. An  year old grip is done for no matter how well taken care of it is and the effort used in taking it off shouldnt be a huge factor in your opinion of the quality of the clubs either. Chances are the older Pings were put on with thicker double sided tape with some sort of solvent while the TM clubs were put on with thinner double sided tape and an air hose. Both methods work great. And an easier to peel off grip could just render itself to a more supple dampening type of rubber that a grip company chose to go with.Not saying that TM is better than Ping or vice versa but they both are very good makers of golf clubs. ,golf,cjaqigb,9,t5_2qhcs

Theyd probably feelsound different at impact but Im not sure its worth the investment over what youve already got.  You can certainly orderplay a combo set that has MP style clubs down to a  iron then go with GI clubs for the longer irons.  Its apparently pretty popular for people to order MPH long irons and MP etc for shorter irons for instance.  Another consideration for you if you want to stay in the Mizuno line they also have the MP line I play MPs currently that has the clubhead size and limited offset of the MP line but a cavity back for forgiveness in the longer irons.  They are made to be small workable but forgiving and to get the ball in the air.  They are pretty easy to hit.  I own Ping G irons as well and feel they are a toss up for ease of use even though the heads are smaller player type on the MPs.  If the ball is in the rough give me the MPs all day as they cut right through it compared to the G.See if you can find a demo day or someplace to hit the clubs near you then youll be able to tell if you can get along with the clubs.  Any authorized retailer should be able to order you anything from a single club to a full set so really its up to you to find the combination that youre happy with.,golf,cjp3itv,3,t5_2qhcs

I actually played well and played off and earned a second alternate position with a  under .  They took  and two alts from my field of . The course I played wasnt that long at  but the back nine was very tough target golf and destroyed lots of people who didnt have control over their ball. If you have options on your local go for a tight and difficult course. It will separate the field and play to your advantage of you can hit it straight. That year I just went and golfed. Second time out I expected myself to make it out and played very poor. I posted up an . The course rating was . and you get  shots berth from there. Needless to say I scraped by. The  shot from the course rating not sure if true to card or if its harder because its a us open local is true and you have to demonstrate elite golf in tournament to regain entry. I think the  shot rule keeps people honest. They know that bad golf happens and if youre open material you can redeem yourself with other scores. Not sure if a club championship would count but other state or usga events or qualifiers would be events where a few rounds at par or better would get you back in. As for finding out more information us local sites are changed yearly and usually announced in February of each year. One more tip if a qualifying site is within  miles of a university the competition may be a little stiff with college players!Hope this helps.  If you end up playing have some fun and something special might happen!,golf,cjro81n,1,t5_2qhcs

Keep your hips back and knees straighter.I also think your takeaway is too flat amp inside.  This also makes it hard not to come over the top.

1706856,0,t1_cjuarol,The problem with your weak long irons is probably due to your swing style.  An outsidein swing is going to require a flipping of the wrist to hit it straight.  Its very unforgiving in terms of timing and probably more so with your long irons.  I would check first if your swingpath is outsidein. If you can record yourself from behind you might be able to see where your path is going.  If you dont have that readily you can also just put a shoe box slightly above your practice ball.  If your swing crashes into the box then you have an outside swing path.  Correct this  and the rest will follow.Just one note if you play decently now this will take a bit longer to learn than someone who is new.  Youve developed habits that help your outsidein path which will make you hit some really shitty shots with a correct swing path.,golf,cjub7np,2,t5_2qhcs

But there is ONLY downside if you are a person of influence and openly conservative.  See the IRS targeting of conservative groups the alleged insider trading of Phil Mickelson only months removed of speaking out against the tax code etc.  If you are an enemy of liberalism you have a target on your back.  The rich all know this and the smart ones keep their mouth shut.    Golfers are also the leastprotected athletes.  They have no union and most tour players are a few bad tournaments away from going back to the minor leagues.  Opposed to Football players or Baseball players who sign multiyear contracts and have a union.  It only makes sense to be conservative in this situation because nobody is out to help you.

My normal partner is a big guy he isnt great so he hits it offcenter or pops up or tops a lot so the majority of his drives end up around  yds or so but when he gets all of it man watch out. So I tend to have the attitude that what if you get all of it and err on the side of caution unless it is going painfully slow already. Then again Ive had people complain to me about waiting on situations like that when if you hit that shot right away it doesnt matter anyways because then you are just waiting again on the next tee. There isnt much you can do if it is the scheduling is that tight to where you have  groups basically on on hole. Id guess that more often that not it is the course scheduling tee times right ontop of each other that cause the issues and a par  is where it is most apparent. ,golf,ckvmiap,2,t5_2qhcs

2125791,0,t3_2jak3e,With a well connected swing the last action of the club head is to swing in a tight arc down around the hands.  Ideally that action is completed with the club face back to square and wrists flexed down with ulnar deviation  adduction as far as they can comfortably go.  The actually squaring of the face is a combination of that action in the hands and the front arm sweeping the now once again fully extended as at address club through the ball.  As the front arm sweeps down is is also rotating the armclub unit at the shoulder.  In other words there are a lot of variables which much occur perfectly before the face strikes the ball.Because the club is hinging around the front shoulder and is angled down the club sweeps from the inside down in the swing arc then inside and up.  It never actually crosses the target line is what is called an insideout swing path.  Calling it that is confusing in terms of the actual cause and effect and understanding things like divot direction.The club arc is like a helicopter rotor tilted forward until the tip hits the ground and takes a divot.  The divot will actually have a slightly curved shape the same as the swing arc if the point of rotation is fixed relative to the ground.  But in the golf swing the front shoulder joint sweeps in arc also and the net effect is that the club plows a divot which usually has such a large radius it looks straight and angles in the direction of the swing path straight for a straight shot to the right for a draw and to the left for a fade.How much the divot slants to the straight balltarget line varies with how much the golfer changes the stance from their normal straight shot baseline.  That straight baseline might be having both toes parallel with the target line or the stance slightly open or closes.  Hogan for example kept the ball position constant relative to his front foot for all clubs and moved his back foot in and out for shorter and longer clubs.Due to the way the swing arcs of arm and hand close the face before impact golfers with consistent well connected mechanics will tend to put a bit of draw spin on the ball even when trying to hit it dead straight.  That the case with my swing so rather than trying to hit the ball dead straight and risk missing left I will instead set up for a straight shot facing slightly right to intentionally tilt the spin axis and curve the ball with a draw unless need to shape or a high trajectory dictates the use of a fade.So as a result my divots are almost never dead straight at the target because Im never trying to hit the ball dead straight.,golf,cla18yr,0,t5_2qhcs

2156124,0,t1_cldtt5q,Well if your handicap is still that high I would prioritize your posture and tempo and balance over pretty much anything else.  Ask your instructor what drills you can do that will help you with these areas.  Im not sure how old you are but just having an instructor sometimes isnt enough.  I have observed a lot of lessons between pros and adult students and the pro realizes that the player isnt really invested mentally and emotionally invested in the game and their own improvement and will react poorly to anything that is too difficult.  But the teacher still wants the lesson fees so they just kind of stroke their ego and have them work on stuff that is easy and wont really help the player in the long run.  If you are a legit  handicap and have been taking lessons for a while you are very far behind the learning curve and this may be what is happening.  If I were a teacher I would only pay minimal attention to the small details of your swing and focus more more heavily on things like balance and tempo drills for a while.  Many adult students dont like to be aught this kind of stuff but in reality if you cant keep your balance and tempo together it doesnt matter what you swing like because you wont hit the ball in the middle of the club face.As for short game Ive never needed lessons in this area but instead I have hit tens of thousands of chips and pitches in my yard growing up.  I did it after school pretty much any day there wasnt snow on the ground.  Maybe lessons can work too but really there is no replacement for sheer repetition and the tiniest little details will become apparent only after you have hit countless chips and pitches. Its good that you want to optimize your time though.  I believe that minimal range time and maximum course time with a lot of reflection and evaluation is the way to go.  Golf is an emotionalpsychological experience as much as a physical one and it takes extreme focus to replicate that on the range.  This is why a lot of people complain that they are great on the range and cant take it to the course.  If you only practice under range conditions and all of a sudden have to deal with actual PLAYING conditions you will struggle.  Ive recently started taking golf somewhat seriously again was competitive then quit for  years in college and the main thing I have been working on is eliminating all the nonessential habits from my game and only focusing on what will result in a lower score.  I have a lot of physical problems too ie sucking at golf so well see how much it helps.  Out of probably  rounds this summer Half were  or under and the other were pretty high due to a serious inability to detect my bad swing habits.  ,golf,cldw59q,3,t5_2qhcs

2375965,0,t3_2mj683,Retired  with a  day membership at a local   hole exective par  course and Ive played nearly every day weather permitting since . Most days I play  holes which at midday when its not crowded only takes about  hours.  But on occasion I have played  or .I kept track of things over my last membership period midJuly  to mid July  and played  out of the  days and logged a total of  ninehole rounds or about  regulation  hole rounds.   I live in Northern VA and we normaly dont get much snow and temps are above  F most days in the winter so what we get melts in a few days usually.  But this past one was pretty brutal due to the Polar Vortex and I only played  days in Jan and  in Feb.  The course was closed about  days due to snow or flooding.  My longest stretch of consecutive days played was . Most weeks Id take Saturday off because of the crowds. Thats a lot of golf but since I play alone most of the time know every inch of the layout and keep most shots on the short grass dont pull pins when putting or grind over them I get around pretty quick playing  in a little over an hour.  My record is  min. with out really rushing just a totally empty course and no delays.  I typically par more than half the holes rarely have anthing over a double on the others.  A couple are difficult to par.  When grinding for score Ill usually shoot around  or  over par for nine holes.  More important to me is that  I manage to hit shots as planned tee to green.  Putting? Thats a different story.Endurance wise its not a problem for me because I did long distance biking and swimming and would spend hours on the bike or in the pool swimming laps.  Golf is much easier by comparison. Im more stiff and sore playing after a weather imposed layoff than when playing every day.  I havent been on the range in about  years I just swing a practice club at home in the morning before heading the course which is  min. away and start off on the first few holes with irons off the tee until warmed up.

I really liked the drag feature to see yardage which you lose with Arccos. But by far the statistical data that you get with Arccos is sick. Ive golfed  rounds with Arccos and have immediately saw an impact. In the  rounds Id golfed before Arccos the best score Id had was a . After just a few round with Arccos Id noticed a trend already. I was coming up short! On everything! Along with a couple other decisions off the tee Ive since had three rounds under . I typically see  or  misreads per  holes but I just correct them when it happens. Most of the time its the putter. Which brings me to my next point. The customer service has been awesome. I finished a round where my putter wasnt reading very well. I kept having to put in putts manually. Literally within  minutes after my round I got an email from Arccos support saying that my round was flagged because my putter wasnt registering putts. I was floored. After a short email convo with support I fixed the issue. I could go on and on. I like seeing all my yardage without having to manually lock in my position. The app is easy to use. The stats the stats the stats! So if you cant tell by now Id definitely recommend it.,golf,cmctylj,2,t5_2qhcs

2523937,0,t3_2ojuws,Put ball and hold club on table at eye level and you will realize lead edge must be under ball when face strikes back of ball.     The greater the loft of the club the more you need to aim impact of lead edge to ground forward under the ball.  This is a fundamental of ball striking which should be taught by an instructor in the first lesson with irons.For shots on tee the concept is the same lead edge under ball at impact.  Even with Driver lead edge is slightly under ball at impact what changes is where on club swing arc ball is placed.Also worth remembering when shaping shots  visualize  aim impact on outside of ball for fade inside for draw.  If you aim at center spin axis will not tilt as planned.,golf,cmo0kxf,3,t5_2qhcs

2694997,0,t1_cn9cf2w,I cant believe idiots are actually upvoting your completely incorrect comment. The lack of knowledge about clubs in this thread is hilarious. Club fitting became a thing? in ? Are you joking? Im sorry but fitting became a thing long before that. You apparently know nothing about fitting and golf history. Learn your shit before you talk out of your ass. Ill give you a lesson. Back before clubs became mass produced lets say the s ALL fucking clubs were fitted. The pro at your course would build and modify your clubs for you. Hickory shafts were shaved in different areas to produce a different kick point. Your irons were bent to different lie angles and lofts to suit your game. Fitting was not a thing it was a standard and understood part of the game.  Through the s one of the pro shops responsibilities was to tweak the clubs of the members. Lie angle loft shaft length flex bounce  weighting w lead tape etc. It was all the club pro that did that.  As golf became more popular public courses became more plentiful and clubs became mass produced and sold in stores like Sears and other department and chain sporting goods stores they made clubs to fit the average person realizing fitting wouldnt be profitable. Starting at this time clubs were set up for a  guy which was around average. Still at private courses and specialty stores clubs were still fit. When the Ping Eye came out in the early s it started a new revolution of fitting with their dot system of clubfitting mass producing cast heads with different characteristics that could be assembled based on the golfers physical characteristics. This was  not  by the way. Ping brought fitting back to the masses in the s although it never really disappeared. Now every major producer offers fitted clubs.  Frankly if you are spending over  on clubs have more than a passing interest in golf and dont get fit you are being stupid. TLDR Fitting has been around forever you are stupid if you dont take advantage of fitting.,golf,cnacsdo,2,t5_2qhcs

You need to focus on getting better. You are wasting brain power on counting scores and day dreaming about outcomes good or bad. Let it go score is just a number. The more you focus  of your game on the current shot at at hand and not your current shot counter the faster your score will drop. Next time you play play every shot one shot at a time regardless of how or how many you got there. When you finish the hole quickly write down the score or any stats and do not keep any running totals. Now this will take all your will power at first but do not keep a running tally in your head. Do not add up your score till the very end of your round. I promise you will surprise yourself and start shooting consistently lower rounds. ,golf,cobr4hw,9,t5_2qhcs
3027975,0,t3_2urulg,always write at least one stroke less than I actually take. all kidding aside... its just making sure im swinging under control. My biggest mistake is over swinging which results in either a slice or a duck hook and you cant break  if you cant keep a ball in play. as far as the greens are concerned I am not trying to make a lot of putts I am trying to lag it as close as possible without coming up short or ramming it too far by. if I can do that then some putts will drop on the first eventually. Chipping can be complicated but again there I am just trying to assess the lie and not pick too risky a shot. if you arent looking to see which way the grass is going underneath your ball you are going to flub some chips just by default. It is important to notice what lie you are playing off of and how the ball has a tendency to react from said lie. it makes all the difference. sorry if this is too poorly structured... im a golfer not an englisher.,golf,cobuios,3,t5_2qhcs

Because if a  handicap was consistently shooting  he wouldnt be a  handicapper hed be at  or even higher. A  handicapper would be a  handicapper if he was just more consistent. Consistency is part of a handicap. Consistently better golf leads to a better handicap. It is the nature of the handicap system.

Usually my tee game gets me in trouble and Im able to save pars by having a good short game. Id say..... Par  rd hole on my home course. Hit a solid drive down the middle and was  out on the fairway. Stuck my  wood within  feet and made the eagle putt.. A shorter par  th hole at my home course. Drive was okay just off the fairway in the rough on the right.  out and chunk the nd shot  feet in front of me. Hit that shot from  out and land it on the front of the green front pin and it rolls in for my birdie. Would like to not have that nd shot.,golf,cp6ed1g,1,t5_2qhcs

3342677,0,t1_cp97lct,those distances are skewed slightly same for the men. The average driving distance is taken on two par s in each round one on the front nine and one on the back nine.  Id be extremely interested to see the actual swing speed of the ladies getting  yards Yani Tseng is  and getting that distance Rory has  inches on her and is bombing it  but has significantly more muscle. I assume the numbers are total driving distance with the regular hard fairways most tournaments are played on now.  edit looking at the LPGA numbers again Michelle Wie is ranked th. She pretty often takes less than driver off of tees and she generates one of the highest club head speeds on the LPGA with her massive advantage of being . She was taking a hybridwood onto a driveable  yard par  at the US open last year when many of these women were not reaching it with their drivers. That said when DJ can bomb a drive yards over the water on the th for a  yard shot into the green on the final hole for a win is stupidly impressive. ,golf,cp9ag69,2,t5_2qhcs

3421792,0,t3_2zejqe,That is the technically best way to swing.  You feel like there is no weight transfer but thats just compared to what you are used to.  A TON of people get good and add distance by learning to play a pronunced draw.  I am one of them.  We load up on our right side then approach the ball through the inside path.  It kills your extension and is also very inconsistent.  My handicap is about a  when I am in practice.  But here is the thing.  I KNOW I am a terrible player.  I cannot control my shots.  I have FAKE distance.  My draw now is about only  yards but I cannot hit straight shots or fades while still compressing the ball fully.  When I do hit it straight it feels like a glancing blow.  I can get around the course but not how I want to.  Im trapped in a cage that is my golf swing.I have tried very hard to get out of it for the last  years or so but without spending a TON of time with lessons and dedicated practice to break down all the muscle memory I learned to fall back on it isnt going to happen.  This is why its important to get lessons and STICK WITH THEM if you want to be a good golfer.  Left to your own devices you WILL get stuck.  Whether thats shooting   or even lowmid s like me you will still plateau out and feel very frusterated.  ,golf,cpib594,2,t5_2qhcs

Finally always put the same amount of effort and time into taking care of a patron regardless of whether or not they tipped.

I mean if you say it after a bad shot it sounds like the worst excuse ever but its really not an excuse. Its real for me too. I think about it on my way to the course. I think about what holes the sun is going to affect me. When Im playing I even turn around and do practice swings the other way to get a good shadowless swing feel before a shot. I notice it when Im watching golf on TV. I love to play when its overcast because I know I wont have to deal with it. Really early in the morning and late in the evening are also good times because my shadow will stretch out so far it wont distract me.I wish I could help you man but sadly I cant figure it out either. I just keep on playing and try to grind out the holes with the sun behind me. I agree with uavitar. I try to really feel the start of my swing and get into the mental picture of my desired shot.

3693543,0,t3_32p3u1,I think of it more in terms of stance at address.  A closed stance back foot slightly back at address promotes a flat swing with an inside out swing path promoting a drawhook.  An open stance back foot slightly forward promotes a more upright swing with an outside to in swing path to promote fadeslice.  I also will generally strengthen my grip ie move hands to the right if I want to work it right or weaken it to work it left. In terms of squaring to the target I assume they mean your immediate flight path.  If you are trying to hook the ball around a tree to land it in on the green your clubface would be square to a target right of the tree rather than the green.  That severe hook youve produced can come in handy.  Your clubface just needs to be aimed well right of the obstacle.   It also helps to practice these shots with a slightly shortened swing at first and really concentrate on swing path  insideout for draws and outsidein for hooks.  In time youll get a feel for which swing paths create more subtle ball movement and how much to strengthen or weaken the grip to get the desired result. ,golf,cqdae2p,2,t5_2qhcs

3851386,0,t3_34iq70,Just a few words of caution.  Be careful when looking for swing advice  while all of us here are well meaning we all have some gaps in our golf knowledge certainly including myself.  There are a lot of different components to hitting a golf ball solidly with good distance and on the proper trajectory  some work together and others do not.For example you have the clubface in a closed position at the top of your backswing  this necessitates a hard drive of the lower body to prevent the clubface from turning over too much through impact which would produce a hook. Shut clubface  good lower body action can work as a swing style see Lee Trevino Dustin Johnson amp Paul Azinger etc..  Unless you change your gripclubface position changing your lower body action to be less aggressive as prescribed in some of the comments will result in some big hooks.Could you possible upload a video from behind you preferably at chest level aimed down your target line?

4111054,0,t3_37q7cm,The only  concerns Id think would be etiquette and pace of play. If you ask Im sure youre father in law will be glad to coach you on etiquette  the basics are just dont bother or hurt other peoples games. For pace of play just try to keep up. If youre struggling just pick up your ball and drop it with your father in law. But if you can advance the ball  yards and dont take  practice swings before every shot youre probably fine.gt What should my expectations be on a par  course?A lot of par  courses are short like each hole is a par . If thats the case then youre extra good to go because keeping up will be a lot easier.gt Should I pick up the ball if I hit double par to keep from holding up others?Nah I would focus on speed not score for when to pickup. Heres the scenario where you pickup  yd hole you hit your drive  yards sideways. Maybe try to advance the ball one more time and if you mishit it severely again just pick it up and drop a couple hundred yards up in the fairway with your father in law. The goal is just to keep up with your playing partners.,golf,crovvy7,4,t5_2qhcs
4111205,0,t3_37qa7n,Hey! Glad youre enjoying yourself out there.Im a competitive if not always serious golfer myself and I play with a set I bought used from ebay. Got a great deal on irons and metals and have been pleased with them over the last few seasons. My only concern for you would be your height. Chances are that whatever you buy online will be too short and youll need to have them reshafted.  Thats not terribly expensive  depending on your choice of shafts recommend steel for irons and graphite for metalswoods but could run around  bucks. There are plenty of decent knockoff brands Big Burners instead of Big Berthas etc. that feel good without being quite as forgiving get what you pay for to some extent and you can usually get complete sets for under . If youre really trying to stay under  I recommend going to ebay and trying to by the set you want for a good price from the tallest seller you can find. Even if the shafts are a little bit short you can still play with them perfectly well until which time.you can have them fitted.Callaways and Taylor Mades are great for novice golfers as they have huge sweet spots for more forgiveness. Whatever you end up getting youll be looking for cavity  backed irons as opposed to forged irons which will make them a lot easier to hit consistently. Hit em straight!,golf,crowie2,3,t5_2qhcs
4111990,0,t1_croykoh,I recently got a driver from Bombtech with a  shaft stiff flex and for the life of me couldnt hit it well. Mainly sliced or big fades with it and the occasional big hook. Once in a while Id get lucky and catch it just right. Got an  lobbed off and it made the world of difference got rid of the whippy feeling. But your shaft is standard length cutting an inch or so from it will change the swing weight and make it stiffer.Before doing anything as drastic as cutting the shaft try playing around with your setup a little bit. From the video it looks like you have the ball quite forward in your stance try moving it back a little to nearer the middle. Try standing a little closer to the ball you appear to be reaching just a bit too much. ,golf,crozqgh,2,t5_2qhcs

Perfect tempo wouldnt save you if you were falling backward trying to hit the ball as many bad players do.

4137617,0,t3_3813ir,I started playing a few years ago and decided to get a lesson or  after my first trip to the driving range. Im a  hdcp atm but it has been dropping steadily from  at the beginning of the year. I am shooting in the low to upper s consistently.The club pro wasnt a pga pro but I wasnt sure if that mattered. They focused more on the mental aspects of the game rather than the technical or fundamentals that go into making a decent amp consistent swing. Maybe they saw a decent enough swing that I didnt need much adjustment I  dont know but at this point Im looking for validation that the swing I have will work. My swing is definitely homemade and I recently videoed myself ugh...at first I was like wtf but now I use it to find any hard flaws. I feel like Ive watched enough videos and read enough books and articles that I can tweak my own swing well enough. My biggest fault at the moment is fear. Ive learned that when I have some doubt or fear when Im over the ball bad things are inevitable. Coincidently that ties in to what the pro was trying to teach. He made the assumption that I think too much. I couldnt agree more I find myself going over a check list while hovering over the ball. Big mistake. He said I should do all my thinking behind the ball while visualizing the shot and then get over the ball and execute the shot. Bottom line do a little research and find a good teacher in your area but be forewarned itll take a few lessons. I seriously doubt that one lesson will fix anything. Find someone who will teach you the fundamentals as well as coaching the mental aspect of the game. Remember even the best players in the world have swing coaches and teachers.,golf,crrwnud,1,t5_2qhcs

4147513,0,t3_38814m,Have you been playing for a while before you took the lesson?The reason I ask is because a lot of times the first couple of lessons are about unlearning the bad habits or compensating moves you might have developed while learningplaying on your own. When your instructor makes an alignment or a grip change it throws everything off in terms of the way you used to be able to hit the ball consistently. It sounds like when he is there hes able to make an adjustment see how you respond and then give you further instruction. When youre on your own a small change even just a grip change can have a huge effect on every other part of the golf swing and you just may not be aware of it.I say stick it out with the lessons so long as hes a reputable instructor. That way youll become more in tune with the right way for you to swing and be able to better make adjustments on your own.,golf,crt15s8,1,t5_2qhcs

You and I are identical builds    lbs. and I found when I added an inch and a half to my clubs everything came in a lot smoother. My posture was better and easier to obtain and it helped to groove my swing considerably because I wasnt reaching or leaning for the ball.There are several factors that go into club building and design but for the most part clubs are made to accommodate someone between   and  with midlength arms so its not surprising that youre not going to fit offtherack clubs. Just dont expect making the first adjustments to magically change you game. Youll still have to groove your swing and there will be more changes to be made to your custom fitting before you get your clubs just right but adding a little length and loft will definitely make it a little easier for someone built like us to at least work on the correct functions and see the correct results.,golf,cs8s93f,1,t5_2qhcs

They are forged but much easier to hit then the  forged.I have been gaming my JPX  Pros  what the  forged is the replacement for  for a few years now and even tho I can play blades and played around with the thought of getting mps I just love my clubs too damn much.If you are spending that much on irons Mizunos aint cheap make sure you get fit for them.  Any store selling Mizunos has a little gadget they can put on the club and you hit a few balls and it spits out some numbers that tells you basically what set of irons and shafts would work for you.  Mizuno really presses this on all their retailers and if you are serious about buying them do this.For instance i had to get different shafts from the stock ones KBS C tapers because I would never be able to play with the stock Mizunos off the shelf as I hit them way too high.  They cost about k the shafts are free upgrades from the factory make sure you get fit or you have just thrown k down the drain.,golf,cslab35,1,t5_2qhcs

Next range session queue the shit show for the first  balls.  In my stupidity I would just swing away thinking I was picking up right where I left off at the end of my last session at the range.  Then I would step back think about my last range session and over exaggerate those swing fixes.  My driver swing was too steep and outside to inside.  I straightened out my driver earlier this year and I still start off my range sessions by swinging uncomfortably flat and inside to out.  Ive learned that feeling doesnt stay with you.  Those last  balls are eclipsed by the feeling and muscle memory of the  balls you hit before that last  balls.  Perfect practice makes perfect.  It takes time.,golf,csmgti3,5,t5_2qhcs

Anytime you see a set with AW chances are youre looking at a set with new lofts.  If you test out both youre going to hit the Callaway longer.  If you dont know that the lofts arent the same chances are youre going to buy the set with the stronger loft because youre hitting it farther.

4531475,0,t3_3d3hdk,Hit less on the range.  If youre hitting more than  balls youre hitting too many before a round and youre fading because youre either tired or out of energy.  I generally dont hit at all before I play at my home course if Im not at my home course Ill hit a few irons and a few drivers under  shots and then Ill hit some putts on the putting green but thats about it.Otherwise I just make sure I eat before I go or get a hotdog between the front and back and I always bring a couple gatorades to stay hydrated.  Then its just golf conditioning and stretching to make sure youre staying loose and relaxed.  Mental fatigue is also a real thing if you are losing focus or getting frustrated then you wont swing as well and thats just as bad as getting physically tired.  So make sure youre relaxed and focusing on the shot ahead and not stewing over the score or poor shot from the previous hole.I generally play better on the back nine partly because it takes me a few holes to warm up but partly because by then Ive long since figured out my ball flight for the day and Ive compensated based on how Im hitting. You may also just be trying too hard if youre swinging with everything you have and you cant maintain that then youre overswinging.  People forget that loose and relaxed with a smooth tempo is faster than trying to crush the ball.  If youre not staying balanced and loose during the swing try thinking of taking a  shot at  and see if you get better results.  A smoother swing results in better contact better contact  more distance and youll be less tired.,golf,ct1tsus,2,t5_2qhcs

Even though chance of leaving a mark or standing up some grass is minimal if you do actually leave a mark you cannot repair it and neither can the other player.  It would be very unfortunate to miss a putt because your playing partner dragged his foot across your line and stood up some grass.  If he repairs it he gets two strokes and you get one if you let him.  If you repair it you get stroked and he gets away scottfree.

Golf is a difficult game but you can save yourself a lot of headache if you get a professional to show you some fundamentals of the full swing. So get a lesson figure out what you need to work on for the time being get some practice in. Then as your progress get another lesson work on another part of your game practice so on and so forth. To make practicing on your own worthwhile you need to at least get to a point to where you understand what you are trying to accomplish.On the short game side putting and chipping I think you can learn a lot from watching a few videos and just putting in the practice time.

4610285,0,t1_ctbl4tz,There was Vijay and Els and a good number of other international players in the s. Speith went on a massive run Zach kept steady in the open and allowed the others to just get destroyed on the greens. Rory is out and injured. Its shaping up to look like an all American sweep  a lot of american players are looking hot and coming off a hot streak Rickie has two wins DJ just seems to always be at the top until he decides he made a bad bogey and lets it get to him something might click at the players. The internationals though are not to be discount as much as it looks like the US is unstoppable Matsuyama could do something special he has been threatening for a long time in the majors but seems to falter Day has a similar issue he can never close it out. Outside of those two in the top  the only non americans are Scott who cant putt and has been fighting putting until he went back to the long stick Garcia who just loses his mind in the majors Rose who is having a pretty average year for but keeps hanging around leader boards and Stenson who just seems to be explosive the first few days and then disappear on Sunday.

4785249,0,t3_3gefsl,Just yesterday I was playing a military course with my brother. We were walking off the th green and a shot lands in the five feet between us. We look out at the fairway and see three carts  people and not a collared shirt among them all acting as if nothing happened no fore no apologies no eye contact. so I took my  degree wedge and hit it back at them. Since it was the turn and a particularly slow round on a crowded course they hung out at the snack bar and let another group get between us as I stood on the tee box fuming and staring at them. Im not a huge guy but my bother is even with that  on  would not have been smart for me to pursue. I get that youre marines out trying to do golf today and youre used to ducking bullets or not who knows but thats no excuse to act like retards making my military friends embarrassed to have you among their ranks. An acknowledgment and apology is all it takes a fucking wave I hate to think if they shirk that responsibility that we are arming these cowards and sending them overseas. The vets I play with would never let a mistake like that go without addressing it at least a wave a sorry from the fairway.

A lot of times they are significantly shorter than they state.For example the driving range facility in my area has distances off of up to  yards  yard marker but I zap  yards with my rangefinder.It could also be the opposite where the yardages are fine but the range balls are so beat up that a lot of distance is lost.Try to get your real distances on the golf course where youre playing with your ball and can get more accurate measurements.

5044622,1,t1_cuu1wpp,Downvotes dont bother me.  In fact I dont take it personally in terms of my own golf game.  But it makes this subreddit annoying to browse when I go to the comments and people are making fun of people and jokes about hitting their lay up sand wedge  yards.  I understand that a lot of people over exaggerate their yardages.  And I also understand that people probably lie about their golf game to look better online.  I dont think that is the issue.  I think the issue is the way most of the people on this subreddit respond to it.  I had a situtation where people were getting on my case about my estimated average drive distance.  I told them I can drive the ball anywhere between  yards to  yards.  I can promise you that  of my drives go between those two distances unless I misshit am hitting uphill or into the wind.  I gave these numbers simply because somebody asked and then I got a bunch of shit for answering honestly.  And for the record I have never tried to accurately measure my yardages.  I just base it on what I think I hit and what various course GPSs and the results of my drive.  For instance today I golfed at a course that had builtin GPS and it was  yards to carry a bunker left of the fairway on a dogleg left par  I carried the bunker with my drive and the ball was easily  yards beyond the bunker.  So my  yards feels right.  Sorry for a continued rant but I just want to contribute to this subreddit without getting shit on!  Also I have never seen anybody on this subreddit say they can hit the ball over  yards on average.  I also dont know anybody personally who can hit the ball  yards regularly but I do know dozens of people who could drive the ball  yards more than once a round.  Its not that crazy and it is also only  of what it takes to be a great golfer.  So when people say that puts you top  on tour that doesnt really mean much to me.  I could probably drive as far as some tour players but I cant drive nearly as accurate or with as much control.  Rant over!,golf,cuu2h8s,0,t5_2qhcs

I mean I never see anyone post swing videos of Inbee Park or Lizette Salas. But as soon as its a hot woman they all flock like its the best swing ever. I mean an attractive woman must inherently be bad at everything and thus its so surprising that one might have a good golf swing that we need to fawn all over.

5081112,0,t1_cuyf8ps,. You do not get relief from the rock unpleasant lies are common and the player must accept them.  You may always take an unplayable lie if you dont want to play it. Artificially surfaced cart paths you do get relief.  One club length from the nearest point of relief no nearer the hole.  If the path is not artificially surfaced there is no relief.  Nets are immovable obstructions and like an artificially surface cart path you get relief unless the net defines out of bounds.  The definition of obstruction excludes items marking out of bounds.  In this case I suspect they define out of bounds so you would not be entitled to relief.. The answer may depend on whether the stakes were yellow or red.  If the stakes were yellow he must keep the point where the ball last crossed the margin of the hazard in line with the hole and go back and drop on that line.  Penalty is one stroke and he can go back as far as he likes.  He may also return to the spot from which the last stroke was made and play the shot again under penalty of one stoke.  If the stakes were red he could drop within two club lengths of where the ball last crossed the margin of the hazard OR at a point equidistant on the opposite margin of the hazard.  From your description it sounds like he dropped much nearer the hole than any of those options would allow.  Penalty is loss of hole in match play or twostrokes in stroke play.  However if he received a significant advantage fromplaying in a wrong place and it appears he may have the penalty is disqualification.,golf,cuygt82,2,t5_2qhcs

5091535,0,t3_3kqjm7,Its a bit hard to tell from that angle but I noticed a couple things. Overall you have a solid swing. I like how you keep the clubhead low during takeaway your position at the top seems good hard to tell without a DTL video and your lag is honestly not bad. Here are my recommendations. Your grip seems a little strong. The V formed between your right hand thumb and pointer finger should point between your right shoulder and chin. Your left hand seems a bit strong as well again a little hard to tell. At address when looking down you should be able to see  knuckles on your left hand. Stance posture and grip are the ABCs of a good golf swing. Its hard to make a good swing when . Your arms get disconnected from your body very early on during your backswing. Just remember that your body should move as a unit during the swing. To fix this you can try the triangle drill during takeaway try and maintain the triangle formed between your arms and shoulders. You can also try this setup normally place the club on your right shoulder make as full a shoulder turn as you can and push your arms out. Thats the position at the top you should be in. So now its just a matter of practicing and getting a feel of where the club should be at that point.. You appear to cast the club ever so slightly. This is what kills your lag. On the downswing try and focus on letting your arms and the club drop swinging from in to out. That will help you maintain lag. . You need to lead with your lower body more on the downswing. Really focus on driving forward with your legs making sure to unwind your hips before your shoulders. Every pro regardless of how weird their backswing is does this exact move.Now theres something I need to say. Focusing on lag is IMO a poor way to practice or swing the club. Lag will come naturally if you unwind your hips before your shoulders. If the club gets slotted into the right in to out plane you will create all the lag you need. My advice is to focus on starting down with your hips pushing your weight forward and then unwind the shoulders. If you do this the club will slot right into place with enough lag. Make sure to keep your arms lose you cant maintain lag if youre tight or stiff. But overall good swing keep working on it! You could also post a down the line video to make sure I havent made a mistake or overlooked something. Cheers!BTW this is a move seen in many sports. An example I give my friends is a tennis forehand. Look at Federer or Wawrinkas forehand. They unwind their hips first then their shoulders creating lag. At the last second right as they hit the ball they snap their wrist releasing all that power. They dont swing with the intention of creating lag their motion creates it!,golf,cuzpzu1,3,t5_2qhcs

I played it last summer and it was a a great day and Im glad I played and b it made me feel like I needed to putt through the clowns nose the greens were so tricked up.  The course was very easy but the greens were basically impossible to read.  That said it was a good day.  Birdied number one   But I wouldnt go back.  I might add that the TV criticism was not fair its a far nicer course than came across in the commentary.  The USGA basically killed the course by not watering it in the month it was closed before the tournament.  I walked around there the day they closed it in late May and it looked perfect then...and then the drought hit.I have not played Trophy Lake or the Home Course but they have great reviews normally.  The other one people used to like was The Classic in Spanaway.Gold Mountain Olympic is a steal for how little they charge and if you like oldstyle courses play their Cascade course too.  Very affordable.  McCormick Woods was very nice too but its been many years since I played either.  Both places took nice care of us.Druids Glen was not pleasant at all for me but I played it when it was set up for a tournament the following day and we lost many balls within a club length of the fairway.  Overrated. Overpriced.  Lousy greens but again its been a number of yearsPumpkin Ridge near PDX was nice but it was to me just another country club like experience albeit one with a nice practice facility.The one I want to play is Gamble Sands in northcentral WA.

You have to be aggressive and make sure you contact the ball first this means being aggressive and trusting the loft of the club and hitting down on the ball will get the ball in the air.

Every player is free to individualize every aspect of their equipment within regulations from their skates to their helmets to their stick which you could compare to a golfers club. But the puck the thing that actually determines the points in a game is standardized. Each player is free to decide which length material flex lie etc in a stick optimizes their ability to interact with the puck but it is the same puck every time.In golf if you standardize the ball players would still be able to customize their clubs to optimize their performance with that particular ball  you wouldnt be asking them to use the exact same club youre just asking them to score points with the same ball essentially,golf,cvjeg4v,2,t5_2qhcs

There is definitely some power there that is bottlenecked. Try to rotate around your spine. Your head looks like it is staying on one spot which is good. Right should drop looks over done. A really good point is that I think you have the right foot braced very well to store energy. I mean it looks like you really have it right like you want to launch. Perhaps its this move that may keep your right hip from opening to clear them both. I think this a good thing for some serious power.

5790266,0,t1_cxet517,Appendix  Part A covers local rules.  Section  allows assisting the preservation of the course by defining some areas such as turf nurseries young plantings and other parts of the course under cultivation as ground under repair.  If the course decides to do this they should make a local rule prohibiting play from these areas otherwise players would have the option of taking relief or playing the ball as it lies.  This is a perfectly acceptable practice and it is not at all uncommon for flower beds to be treated as ground under repair from which play is prohibited.Staking lateral woods as ground under repair seems to have no support in the rules.  Unless the trees are newly planted they are just trees for which no relief should be given.  If the area is environmentally sensitive the area should be marked as an environmentally sensitive area and a local rule clearly describing how to take relief should be made.  For an area to be environmentally sensitive it must be declared environmentally sensitive by an appropriate authority which means a local state or regional governmental agency must designate it as sensitive.  Courses often abuse this option marking large areas as environmentally sensitive to speed play.Marking an area as environmentally sensitive is insufficient any area of the course or adjacent to the course may be deemed environmentally sensitive including hazards bunkers etc.  For example at a course near me there is an endangered species of terrapin that lays eggs in the bunkers.  This makes areas of the bunkers environmentally sensitive but they are still bunkers.  An environmentally sensitive area should be marked as such by using greentipped stakes but the other markings should also be included.  So if a lateral water hazard is environmentally sensitive it should be marked with red stakes topped with green paint.  Guidance should be given on how to proceed.  It simply means that entry and play from is prohibited and the only options are to proceed under the other relief options of Rule  all of which carry a one shot penalty.Im amazed that clubs just put up a sign that says environmentally sensitive and automatically assume players will know how to proceed.So to answer your question was conceding the hole the right decision we have to consider a lot of things.  The committee marked the area with blue stakes which signifies the area should be treated as ground under repair.  You were entitled to relief and should not have conceded the hole.  That said the player is not entitled to benefit from committee error so if the committee erred in marking the course and you knew they erred because you are now more rulessavvy than the committee  you should call them on their error and play the ball as it lies.  Committee error often occurs when stakes are used in marking water hazards.  They place stakes carelessly and some portion of the water ends up outside of the stake.  Do you get relief as casual water if your ball finds the water outside of the line made by the stakes?  Nope you are still in the hazard.,golf,cxeu5lc,1,t5_2qhcs

6044705,0,t1_cybvn6k,Based on OPs concerns Im guessing that hes implying that he thinks some of the players might be sandbagging. Or that they play a game where the occasional blow up hole has caused a high cap but they may dominate in match play where cumulative strokes do not count. I know my cap is high due to the odd  or  but theres enough pars in there to scare someone in match play.Unless you know all of the players well enough either to assign a temporary handicap cap the higher cappers at a cut off or get everyone to agree to take  of handicap youre stuck.A game that Ive found works a bit better in this situation is a tombstone type game where every player gets  of their official handicap strokes  i.e.  for a  handicap making his total stroke limit  on a par . Each player has to plant his tombstone where his stroke limit shot landed so if his th shot landed on the th fairway it would be planted there. Last survivor wins. Ive found the lower cappers come out on top but the higher cappers still have a good battle. Obviously taking the same stroke percentage off everyones handicap favors the better players.,golf,cybyv1x,1,t5_2qhcs

6150417,0,t3_3zktyb,Personally the first place I would put my money is lessons.  You cant figure out what you need in clubs unless you have a repeatable swing.  And perhaps regripping your clubs if the grips have started to get hard or slick.After that maybe filling out the set.  Get a sand wedge and lob wedge if you dont have one  the wedges are the most important for scoring because no matter how good you are youre going to miss greens and youre going to want a variety of shots to recover.  Then a driver.  Choose a putter that youre really confident with.  Then get some newer fairway woods and perhaps a hybrid.  Id replace the irons last.Modern technology has definitely done the most with drivers followed by fairways and hybrids.  The newer materials and design techniques are better employed in the hollowbodied clubs.  Irons have definitely changed much less.  I have a set of s Hogans s Ping Eyes and modern Titleist  oversize irons.  The newer ones are definitely more forgiving but the s pings are almost as good and I can still hit decent shots with the s irons.  The difference is maybe a couple strokes per round if that.  The iron on up will be pretty much the same on any set of irons.Heres a discussion of the Palmer PhD irons  apparently they were pretty good forgiving irons for their time.  Eventually youll want to get a set fit for you.  You can still save money by buying used and getting them adjusted.I also agree with the advice about hitting with a wood until you can get consistent with it.  A driver has less loft and a longer shaft so its harder to hit.,golf,cyoqkzp,1,t5_2qhcs

6169662,0,t3_3zt3tf,st thing I notice has already been mentioned here your head. Seems to move a lot less so from the DTL video but in both videos there is a definite drop in the head on the back swing and a rise in the head on the downswing. You dont see any tour players heads moving around this much but please correct me if I am wrong I just cannot think of any. I have played with many good golfers that move their head a little and your movement is small but could be something to work on if you find you are having fat or thin shots with this type of movement. You also have a tiny bit of that hip sway stuff that everyone talks about but I am convinced that doesnt really matter. Your lower body in general seems more active than most. Again I wouldnt consider this a flaw unless your strike is suffering. Definitely dont sacrifice any of that silky sweet tempo you have just to quiet your lower body. That being said you do have a great drive overall with the lower body and hips. It is not as exaggerated as some but you do seem to get some good power this way and I am less concerned with the rotational aspect as some others that have posted since the drive is nice. One thing I definitely notice here is you feet during this drive. You are literally jumping at impact. If you freeze frame at point of impact both of your heels are really high off the ground with all of your weight on your toes. This could be for many reasons but I would suspect that it gives you some power and since you play at such a high level you are clearly coordinated enough to trade balance for power in this way and still strike the ball. I would guess that this might also be a way to compensate for the head dip by raising the lower body to compensate for the drop in the upper. Again I see no need to change as a lot of good players do this as long as your strike is not suffering. Great swing overall would love to see some slowmo if you have an iPhone or capable camera.Thanks,golf,cyqxdei,1,t5_2qhcs

6275529,0,t3_41jrc4,To answer your question seriously Scotty Cameron is half good marketing and half quality product. Once you get to the top tier putter makers the quality is negligible  Cameron Odyssey Ping Taylormade Bettinardi Byron Morgan Machine Yes etc. I would truly say the most innovative putting company out there is Ping and those were from designs way back in the day  the Anser and Anser  designs which are probably the most used on the PGA Tour. There just isnt much tech you can put into putters. You either have the ability to read greens and make a controlled stroke or you dont. Scotty has basically taken these old school designs and created modern variations of them using precision machines   newport newport  timeless tour rat variations etc.Also in terms of manufacturing these days not many companies sell  piece milled putters anymore. Its cheaper to produce putters the way Odyssey does by using an insert. If you cant tell the feel difference between putters it wont matter but for certain people distance control is much better using a milled  piece putter  more feedback than what an insert putter can give is sometimes helpful.So why are Camerons expensive? Because they get heavy use on tour and average golfers want to use the same stuff as the best in the game. Tiger Rory Spieth Phil Adam Scott Fowler DJ Sergio and pretty much most of the top guys on Tour have used a Cameron at some point or another. Its simple as this and its why golf companies pay pros on tour tons of money to play their stuff. Also this r really needs a Scotty Cameron FAQ stickied to the top.

Not to mention my game off the tee isnt what hurts me I hit the ball fast and long because my swing allows for a lot of power to be generated due to the abnormal moves i make according to my pro and to be honest I hit the fairway a good percentage of the time and almost never hit tee shots OB. I really posted this video to see if there is anything completely wrong with my swing and to see if there were any small things i could work on before my next tournament.

6454929,0,t3_441kiv,From the descriptionTK WEDGES  They could redefine the entire category.Modern wedges bear a puzzling similarity to those dating all the way back to the s the ones Ben Hogan said should not be hit over  yards. This from a man who was known to hit his driver . What Mr. Hogan knew was that the heavy bottom and thin upper face caused very inconsistent distances with full swings.That insight inspired us to completely reengineer the design of wedges to make them much better at full shots than any other wedge you can play. And we built in even more innovations to make sure they were more versatile around the greens than the wedges currently in your bag.The new Hogan TK wedges will show you that you are a much better wedge player than you might have thought.,golf,czmzczz,1,t5_2qhcs

I have had that bare bones Nike for so long that looking at the newer Ogio amp Sun Mountain bags I seem to think I dont need that  feature. When I bought the Nike in  or  it probably ran somewhere in the  range anyhow. Just sucks having to buy a new bag. The guys at the golf stores have been asking what I need  out of a bag. My answer has been I dont know that it holds  clubs and the all zippers work I guess. It seems a lot of the newer stand bags look like cargo shorts with zippers and pockets everywhere. I would honestly prefer something simpler. I found a nice Top Flight bag at Dicks the other day but my buddy laughed at me when I was seriously considering it.

6863942,0,t3_49osbq,The question Id have is if you are in the s whats keeping you from the s? Is your distance control using your current preferences generally on or off? How many greens in reg? By how much are you missing when you do? Are you able to see a target pick a club and be confident in your approach to that target? If you are simply a crappy putter then the question is moot. But I agree with the general consensus that a normal gapping between clubs and using all your clubs should yield better results.I practice at home now highly recommended if you have the room to do so but if I was to go to a range Id do it the same way. Today Ill hit PW i i and either my h w  driver. Next time out Ill hit GW i i etc. Next time LW i i etc. It makes me not have a favorite anymore.

It is not particularly strong fasttwitch or precise. Its purpose is to manipulate spine angle. In a golf sense that means its trying to be a stable bridge between your hips and your shoulders.Doing some area specific work to strengthen core is a good idea. When youre fatiguing or when your technique is failing your back gets put to work to replace some combination of hip flexors hamstrings or glutes. Usually this results in decreased performance and increased risk of injury for most activities.I would do some core work some hamstring stretching very important back pain can in fact be displaced hamstring pain and try to make sure that youre maintaining spine angle on your swing.

I actually prefer having two completely different finished wedge for my sand and lob wedge  and  degrees.Instead of the traditional setup of   and  i personally suggest a  wedge system of  and  or if you can manage to find it a  hard to find and  combo this frees up a club once you start reaching the limit of  clubs a bag. Not sure where you are from but most places do not allow you to test hit a club without having duct tape covering all over the face which depletes the meaning of testing a wedge as you are looking for feel spin and durability of the face.if a combination of spin feel and durability is what you want...then i suggest look for something in a satin finishif spin is what you are looking for as main priority...look for something that is oil canned and rustic finish...it will rust over time creating more surface area for spin as the wedge agesa black finish is great for feel but not as durable  aesthetically.make sure you like the look of the club...the weight of the club...and how the club sits different sole grinds.a high bounce grind is great for softer fairways but may bounce more on harder fairways causing skulled shots and digs more into the sand vice versa for a low bounce. get a standard bounce if you aint sure what you want.other than that...open mind and dont let brand dictate you!try all name brands...and japanese spec brands...see what feels good in your hands and inspires confidence in you!happy shopping!i was told vokeys was the best commercial wedges...but i ended up playing Nickent DX forged wedges...back in ...now I play wilson staff fg tour wedge in my  and a cleveland in my ...,golf,d11or8e,5,t5_2qhcs

When I first teed off this guy hereafter referred to as Weirdo asked me if I wanted to group up with his threesome since I was a single. Normally I would but I told them that it was wide open in front and my wife wanted to meet me for dinner so I declined. Weirdo looked a little put off the other two guys laughed like they knew what I was talking about and off I went. I zoomed through most of the front  until I ran into a traffic jam on hole . The first group I met asked if I wanted to join up to make a foursome since I wasnt going anywhere so I agreed. I finished out the front  with them and then  guys quit.So now Im waiting on the th tee with one other guy a senior named Ernie. Weirdo and his group pull up behind us. Weirdo looks at me with an unmistakable expression of anger and he says So you joined up with this guy but didnt want to play with us!? I dont know this guy at all but I said Well I was moving along pretty good until I got slowed down. Is that a problem? ... No not a problem.Ernie and I played  or  holes then we come to a standstill. Then a twosome father and son come zooming by us they see theres nowhere to go and they come right back to my group and ask if they could fill out our foursome. Ernie and I agree and we begin to tee off.Again Weirdo from Teebox  rolls up and this time he is OUTRAGED. NOW YOURE A FOURSOME?! ARE YOU SERIOUS? I was about to explain AGAIN but the son pipes up and says Yeah so what? Weirdo explodes in rage. He starts cussing up a storm kid starts giving it right back and I start walking towards Ernie on the senior tees and say QUITE FACETIOUSLY Dont look now Ernie but theres gonna be a fist fight.As soon as the words leave me mouth I hear a coughing hack and I turn around to see Weirdo with his hands around the sons throat. Hes got him up against the cart choking and shaking him.The dad hops out of the cart shoves Weirdo away and he and the son just decide to leave the course. Weirdo drove past us  minutes later probably to leave as well.,golf,d1ertfw,10,t5_2qhcs

7160510,0,t3_4dll48,I have owned Game Golf but sold it and recently bought the Zepp attachment but probably will sell it too. Dont be put off though. They just arent for me. Game Golf. I liked the interface and the tagging was no problem. It was the accuracy that got to me. I know it a averages out over time but after every round I couldnt help adjusting every single position a little to where is actually was. In the end I have moved to a strokes gained system with an excel doc. I prefer the insights.Zepp. The main offerings are immediate visibility of swing plane hand path tempo and hip movement if your phone is in your pocket. I use my iPad because getting my phone in and out of my pocket was getting annoying. The tempo isnt an issue for me at the moment but the swing plane is very helpful. Sometimes I used to think that I was leaving the face open with a correct plane for certain shots but it was actually a slight out to in path that was also to blame. My recommendation would be to get a lesson whereby you then know a problem you need to fix and see if these help before buying. With game golf pay attention to your course management  especially your distance accuracy per group of clubs e.g. Short irons. Game golf will probably make the awareness of issues like these easier to identify and monitor but I doubt that it identifies anything you cant figure out on your own. Hope this helps. I need to stop impulse buying and take my own advice. Much easier to give it than apply it as they say...,golf,d1s2x3u,2,t5_2qhcs

The optishot is accurate enough to have fun playing and get a general sense of where your ball is going but it really is just guessing with your speed and face angle to determine the flight so it can be very hit and miss still a lot of fun though and gets your swinging. ,golf,d2087ag,1,t5_2qhcs

7237520,0,t3_4ek94j,My go to drill is to find a flatish surface at your range or club and set your putter at address and put a tee just off the toe and just off the heel so your putter fits between the two. Hit balls repeatedly so you know that when you address a putt your stroke is true. Start with light power and work your way up from there. Also I like to put my putter in the hole so the shaft is the longest point away and place a tee. Do this around the home four times so you have  tees. Take putts from there. ,golf,d20uqqi,1,t5_2qhcs

Instead people should be playing more forward tees.I hit the ball about  on drives but I am not very consistent. When I am playing a par  thats north of  yards if I dont hit a clean drive Im screwed.

Probably had something to do with the slow group ahead. I know I hate playing into a slow group...usually puts me on tilt. Let me give you a tip...find a pro golfer who is about your size and youtube a video of their swing. Set up your phone and take video of your swing while you are out on the course I use a headcover or something to prop it up...or the gf. Try to emulate it as close as possible and work on little details of their positions at certain points in the swing. You will improve just by mimicking the swing! I promise!

If they are keeping up without badgering then it shoukdnt matter much is they follow basic politeness like not hitting into people etc. The time of your round is not ideal for absolute beginners but at the same time even those guys that play early tend to have a shotty golfer or  in their some so it kind of evens out. I guess what i am trying to say is that as long as you have some nice eye candy and the partners are pleasant and are keeping pace i would not worry too much unless you just hate  giving advice on the course never met a golfer that fell into this category.

7549236,0,t3_4ipy5q,I would not be concerned about only taking a  minute lesson. That is plenty of time to get good instruction on a couple of areas. And frankly its pretty tough to make several adjustments all at once.If youre stuck working on a particular skill and you seem to lose the technique you are looking for as your range session progresses or you just cant quite get it there is nothing wrong with having an instructor spend more time with you and effectively watch a full practice session but thats not necessary for valuable instruction. Certainly depends on where you and your game are at but I like to go to a lesson with one or two primary things to work on and not really take on much more than that. With a good instructor youll get additional instruction and feedback but I like to keep the primary focus pretty narrow and really work on a particular lesson or two.Like almost everything else in golf best way to go is with whatever feels comfortable.

7679694,1,t1_d3excmy,Yeah Im going to go ahead and say that if people arent playing golf because they have to tuck their shirt in wear a collared shirt and something other than jeans... thats their own fucking issue and frankly I dont want them out there.I think dressing decent gets you better treatment and not only that you are at least attempting to follow the guidelines of the course and probably are more likely to follow all the guidelines. I watched a foursome of tee shirts and jeans tee off yesterday. Three of them left a trench from topping the ball with no repair. The other hit his ball on the adjacent fairway at a cart and never yelled fore. This isnt anecdotal but an observation.To me its like the rule that you have to have your own clubsbag. Shows you are a golfer and understand the risks of the golf course and general etiquette. At least thats how the bagclubs is looked at legally. You can call it elitism or what have you but theres plenty of things that keep people that dont give a fuck out of businesses and norms that exist everywhere.

Also  your shoulders at setup are pretty much parallel . Get that right shoulder a bit lower. This will also help put more weight on your rear foot. With regards to your hip turn.  Try to get your rear hip up and away as far away from the ball on your backswing as possible.  Now do the exact same thing with your front hip through impact.

If money is a concern fossil trace is  dollars after  and the other two I got reasonably off of teeoff.com. I probly wouldnt recommend city park but it wasnt bad either. Rough was really long and thick,golf,d3r508j,2,t5_2qhcs

Range time of just nailing balls down range isnt helpful.  Work on figuring out your short game distances how well can you control the ball inside yards?.Also dont restrict your practice to the range you can get work in every day.  Dry swings for minutes a day focusing on a controlled backswing through the hip turn can help reinforce the proper body control.  Putting also is easy to fit into a quick daily routine.Besides that there is course management.  Have you tracked your fairways off the tee?  How about greens in regulation?  Lastly how many putts in a round?  That can narrow down where you need to focus your practice time.,golf,d45alrm,2,t5_2qhcs

7929794,0,t1_d47dh1a,This is true for match play. The away player always has the honor. Generally when a player hits a putt close the put is either given or the player may ask if his opponent wants him to mark it or finish it in. Usually it its close but they dont want to give it theyll let them finish or theyll tell them to mark it but give it to them eventually if they make their putt. He is correct in saying that if you putt when you are closer without asking your opponent can make you mark and replay the putt this goes for any shot whether its on the green or not really. ,golf,d47dtez,1,t5_2qhcs

I keep my grip nice and even and keep the pressure through my hands and elbows really easy. Then just turn the shoulders. You dont want to twist just imagine turning a corkscrew spine stays the same angle just twist the shoulders on top. Itll be weird but will make sure your hands are really quiet. Should help ease the anxiety and hands in the stroke. Hope this helps! Yips are grim. ,golf,d48p015,1,t5_2qhcs

8011738,0,t3_4ox6ot,I gotta disagree with them handling it correctly. If Lowry doesnt have a meltdown and this ends up tied at the end of  before the penalty they just destroyed the image of the win for Lowry and it doesnt look like he worked his ass off for the win it looks like the USGA picked a winner. As for requiring review they had plenty of time to review it so much time that they were willing to put a guy on national television and discuss it instead of having the official continue to review. So they wanted to talk to Dustin about it before assessing the penalty im sure the discussion didnt go much farther than it did on the tee box. Officials arent expected to get everything perfect and hindsight yada yada but this was disgusting to watch play out a lot of which as you said can be blamed on Fox and their band of jocks commentating but a completely avoidable situation. ,golf,d4gle3h,1,t5_2qhcs

Thats why I went pull.The band aid fix is to flatten out your left wrist. Will shallow the swing some keep the clubhead behind longer and close the face a bit to help straighten out the slice.  Then work on the flip and arm stall. That is probably causing the chicken wing too.   ,golf,d4n2jng,0,t5_2qhcs

Heres from a Team Titleist employee I found on their site Hi guysHere is a little more detail on the differences between practice balls and xouts.  Pro V Practice golf balls are conforming products that differ only due  to a cosmetic blemish such as paint ink or registration of stamping.  Pro V Practice golf balls do not have any construction or performance  deficiencies. Pro V XOut golf balls are also conforming  products. However they usually have a cosmetic blemish andor  occasionally have a minor physical defect that should not significantly  affect its performance. More often than not the physical condition  causing the ball to be stamped as an XOut is so minute that it is not  recognizable by the player.Both products may be used in the  casual round of golf including those with scores posted for handicaps  and most competitions with the possible exception of high level  competitions invoking the Local Rule requiring balls to be on the List  of Conforming Golf Balls.,golf,d4sqgd8,2,t5_2qhcs

8133362,0,t1_d4u7svt,Totally agree. That said the process of swinging freely based upon sound preswing fundamentals and without thinking about body mechanics while swinging will allow you to identify anything that might be a consistent errorflaw for you particularly through the use of video analysis and working with a pro. Im not saying at all that working on technicalities should be completely ignored. The key is that you have to find what it is that you might be doing wrong and what it is that fixes it if you are doing something wrong and the only way to do that is to learn the fundamentals of preshot setup and routine and then just swing. So many folks really only have one or two BIG things that can or do go wrong in their swing but the only way to identify them is to just swing and learn whats causing it when the result is poor. If you setup to the ball and then throughout your swing are thinking hinge wrists onepiece takeaway shoulder turn dont go past parallel with arms at the top now fire hips first turn upper body through the ball finish high keep front foot in place etc. etc. etc. then when the result is poor you really have no idea why.,golf,d4u9hml,1,t5_2qhcs

8135116,0,t3_4qml2t,I have always been told the general rule is based off of your driving average. I tend to think of it as both distance and your handicap. I play with plenty of guys who can hit the driver pretty consistently  but its way left way right etc. I would never recommend them to move to the blues just on their distance especially driver distance. Driver is one of the easier clubs to hit. I average about  off the tee for my gamer shot and still play from the whites. Until I start shooting par on the whites I dont see any reason to hit the blue tees. Have I played them? Yea sure I recently played with some friends who were adamant we play blues. Luckily I have the distance with both the driver and my irons however after about  holes they decided whites were best.Basically what my rambling is trying to say is leave the ego at the door. Too many times i see people trying to play blues or blacks and they should really be on whites or even the ladies tees but their ego wont let them.,golf,d4uglmu,2,t5_2qhcs

8315704,0,t1_d5gz0ku,Totally agree.  Breaking  is really that first threshold where if you have a moderately consistent golf swing you can start to think about lowering your scores.  To do this you have to start thinking strategically on each hole and each shot as you work your way through the course.  It is probably the most overlooked aspect of the game for both high and mid handicappers like myself.  But like everything else in golf is something that you have to develop as a skill because it becomes even more important as you try to reach all of those milestones of improvement.  If you step up to the tee and just try to blast your driver as far as possible every time youre probably doing it wrong.  For example if youre playing a shortish par  and you know your intent is to just get a GIR in three shots ask yourself if you even need to hit driver when you could hit a  iron straighter off the tee.  Two four irons and youre probably going to be  yards out and youve eliminated the risk of putting your tee shot OB.  A low risk strategy and being  yards out is a much better plan than being  yards out in two when your tee shot may be in the rough or worse.  These type of scenarios are the stuff you have to think of as your scores improve and as you get better is just becomes about executing your plan tee to green and then sinking putts.Also developing a good putting stroke is critical.  It wasnt until I started to strike putts purely that I started sinking putts with any sort of reliability.  The best exercise for putting I ever did was to just practice putting balls with my eyes closed.  You start to develop feel and eventually you will start to pure your putts.  Until that happens you will never out the putt on your planned line.  ,golf,d5h0ph9,2,t5_2qhcs

8328553,0,t1_d5iljcx,It really is a great course! Theres not many members either so it can be pretty quiet at times. I had the course to myself for the most part yesterday. I didnt see another person during my whole round.    Club Technology is probably the biggest difference followed by ball technology. I remember the first time I hit my SLDR driver a few months back and I was shocked. Both of those technology improvements combined is huge! Course setup is tougher now as well. The introduction of hybrid clubs seems to help people a lot. I dont have any hybrid clubs. I tried them and found them strange to hit so I got SLDR irons   SW. I have a driver  wood  wood  wood as well. The  wood is a life saver huge loft on it. I can knock it around  or so.  Tempo and being fluid are key man. Sounds like youre on the right path for sure.  My goals? I want to be a scratch golfer. My grandfather was a scratch golfer he helped design my home course back in Ireland too and was the mayor of our town. He was well respected. Id like to follow in his footsteps and get down to scratch. Once I do that who knows haha. Well see if Im good enough. Id love to play in some Amateur tournaments once I can get my drives up to around   if I can do that at all. Im ft  so the distance might be limited although Ian Woosnam seemed to make it work and he was only ft  too but courses were not Tiger Proofed when he was playing. I think his average driving distance was  so it is possible!  I have to admit there is a part of me that would love to go all the way and get paid for golfing. Thats the dream we all have right? I dont care if it takes me until the senior tour to be able to do it haha. Imagine getting paid for golfing while retired? Amazing. Well see what happens. When I started playing again I jokingly said it to my wife that I was gonna either go pro or get down to scratch in the next five years. It looks like I have the chance to get down to scratch a lot sooner. I think the next handicap revision at the end of the year should have me down to . or thereabouts. Im making progress way faster than I imagined. I didnt plan on being there until at least .   Shooting in the s is interesting. It feels great. I have to tell myself Im going to go around and par every hole. That was my attitude yesterday when I played. I was walking up to the first tee which was hole  as I started on the back  yesterday... anyway walking up to the tee box thinking to myself Im going to do this. Its easy. I have it in me. No problem at all... and I got under my drive a bit too much. It went around  yards but was dead center of the fairway. I took out my  wood hit it perfectly it landed exactly where I was hoping it would which was to the right of the green just over the ridge and ran right up to the hole. Missed the hole by about a foot and ended up about  feet passed it. I missed the put and got a par but that set me on my way. It just feels amazing. It is the kind of game that when youre playing good youre on top of the world but when youre playing bad it sucks. I have to get better mentally and learn how to stop the rot. On July th I started badly and it just went from bad to worse so fast. I was disappointed in myself but my swing was off that day as I said and I was shattered. I still get nervous playing in front of people too. Something I need to work on. ,golf,d5imhh2,1,t5_2qhcs

A better feeling for good weight transfer is to feel like Im stepping down on something with my left foot before I start to swing down. If I bump my hip forward I have a tendency to spin my hips open too fast and risk leaving the face wide open or even worse a shank.What kind of hand path difference are you seeing in your swings?

8385140,0,t3_4ufzkf,Example first hole holeGet to the first tee grab your driver and tees and have  golf balls two in your pocket and one ready to tee up. You let the other people figure out who hits first. When its your turn you tee up the ball. You then stand back  feet behind the ball and look where youre aiming. Imagine railroad tracks going through the ball and to the target. Walk up and take your stance by standing parallel to the railroad tracks. Take your grip place the club behind the ball and aim the club face down the railroad tracks too. Golf ball should be sitting in line with your left arm pit or chest. Slight knee flex. Look at your target one last time and then go for it. Naturally you miss completely. Laugh it off and regroup. From now on you dont make a big deal about missing. Try again and top the ball  feet in front of you. Go get it and look at the group and ask if you can try one more time. You top it again. Go pick it up and put the ball in your pocket and put the club in your bag. Walk or ride in the cart and drop a ball next to your partner or whoever hit the best shot. Wait for your turn to hit. Ask someone if its your turn. Line it up like the first one. Railroad tracks and all that. Probably top it again or hit it in water. Go pick it up or leave it in the lake if you cant get it. Get to the green and grab your putter. Have a quarter or a ball mark in your pocket. Wait for people to mark their balls and fix their divots. Drop the ball on the green either next to someone or like  ft from the hole as long as youre not in front of someones ball. Ask if that spot is cool. Take aim and hit. Probably hit it way too hard or way too short. Walk up and try one more time if youre still the farthest away. If not wait until youre the farthest. Have someone show you how to mark it. Everyone putts out and you tap your ball into the hole. Enjoy the sound. Woohoo! You finished your first hole! Congrats! Now do it  more times while drinking and laughing and making sure you dont accidentally get hit by other peoples golf balls! Equipment  clubs max. Just take out  of the woods in the bag. Keep a driver and a  wood and  wood. The rest should be good. Get as many of the crappiest and cheapest golf balls you can find. Like ... Or more. Wear a glove on your lead hand. That means if you swing from right to left it will be your left hand. Get a bag of tees at the pro shop. Wear sunscreen and prepare for a long day outside. Collared shirt tucked in and shorts. No jeans. Etiquette This is most important. Wait your turn to hit. Youll be teeing off last on probably every hole. Better players should hit before you off the tee box. After that whoever is farthest from the hole hits first. The other players should help give you directions if youre unsure so just ask.Youre going to suck. Really bad. Probably worse than anything youve ever done. That means you may swing and miss completely. Or top it every time. Or chunk it into the ground. This is to be expected. Everyone has experienced it with golf. Dont be upset or embarrassed. Laugh it off and after a few crappy swings youll start connecting more and more. If all goes well youll connect a few times and maybe more depending on your hand eye coordination. But be ready to pick up. Take a swing and if you connect and launch it down the fairway or onto the green woohoo! Most likely youll top it and it will go a few feet in front of you. Or into a bush. Or into water. Pick it up if you can get to it quickly and maybe try one more time if the group is cool with it. After that no matter what happens you go pick the ball up and hit your next shot near whoever hit it the best. Shut up when people are hitting. Dont stand directly behind them or too close. Be mindful of your shadow and get it out of their line of sight while theyre hitting. On the greens try not to walk in between someones golf ball and the hole. If youre the farthest out you should be lining up your shot and getting ready to hit. People will quiet down for you and wait for you to hit. If youre unsure whos turn it is again just ask. Just be aware of where people are hitting. You dont want to walk in front of someone who doesnt see you as they swing. That could really hurt. If people were playing darts you wouldnt accidently walk in front of them while they throw. Think of it like really far darts. Swing Before you hit you need to aim. Stand  feet behind the ball and imagine a line drawn between the ball and your target. As you address the ball you try and stand with your feet knees and shoulders parallel to that imaginary line. As you swing its more of a big body turn. Weight shifts to the back foot in the back swing then shifts to the front as you hit the ball. Try to relax and turn your torso and let the arms be pulled through by your body. Imagine any physical move towards hitting a ball or punching something or even kicking something. You would never throw your arms or legs at something without first turning your body and clearing your hips. Arms follow the body turn onto your front foot. Get your weight through it. You should feel a pull through lead shoulder as it turns through dragging your arm with it. Back of your lead hand should be facing your target at impact. Dont think about any if this shit while hitting the ball... ,golf,d5povok,2,t5_2qhcs

In theory theres only  or at most  foursomes a day of those and theyre basically the price courses have to pay to have GolfNow do their online booking system. Ive had a course treat me what I would consider to be worse after purchasing a Hot Deal but never after obtaining a regular tee time through GN.

The thing that makes them pros is their amazing ability to make great recovery shots that still put them in a position to score.

8638343,0,t3_4y5ubp,Counterpoint yes. I grew up playing with a beautiful  Hogan set that belonged to my late Grandpa a scratch golfer. I played quite a bit every summer and thought I could someday become a scratch golfer  without every taking a lesson  with far inferior clubs to my friends because my gpa was so why not me.This obviously didnt work. I consistently shot in the s while only breaking  once. It was so embarrassing during a work outing last year that I almost hung up the clubs for good. But this summer I got the itch again and decided that if I got new clubs I would feel the need to work on my game more.It worked! I still havent taken a single lesson at least in person but after dropping dough on some new irons driver wedges and one I hybrid I was motivated enough to not let them go to waste. I learned how to swing these things like any responsible millennial would YouTube. There are a ton of great channels and instructors it can be a little overwhelming. But I suggest you find a guy you like and stick with him. Record your swing compare it to the YouTube videos tweak repeat.Long story longer.  year ago I shot a  courtesy of SwingbySwing with my old Hogans at a local favorite course.  days ago I shot an  at the same course. I have a mens league event tonight with all my buds and Im currently the summer points leader! So my argument is to get new clubs!

I dont go full Miguel but I stretch and then Ill take a few good practice swings to ramp up the speed.  I am picky about my driving ranges.  Most places I play at have pretty worn down ranges.  By that I mean grassturf that hasnt really grown in that you would experience on the course.

Ping which are used by many on Tour tend to make cast clubs and they have a couple of major winners gaming them. The issue with cast clubs is that they can sometimes lead to hot spots on getting club face where the ball will fly off a little further than wanted. You can Google the differences between cast and forged and there are plenty of articles discussing it. Also forged are more expensive as its a more labour intense process to create them.

However one of my points was that being big does not mean you are going to be a long hitter. There are plenty of smaller or averagesized players that kill the ball and there are plenty of greats that are not noticeable freaks of nature in size.Ignoring all of this the average height of South Korean males   . is barely smaller than that of the US    or the UK   . Average weight is a bit bigger of a gap but I would be very surprised if the weight gap isnt partially due to higher rates of obesity or being overweight for the general population of the UK and US and Asian eating habits and diet or at least what Ive known of it. I dont think the weight difference is due to Koreans naturally having less muscle or something. And for the sake of this argument athletes at a competitive level in any country for the most part are going to be in good shape.And Im an American without a bit of Korean in me  I dont think I have any biases in this.Edit I can tell you for sure an average  American MLB player is definitely above average height in the US.

8997713,0,t1_d7t8ji3,Im no pro but Ive seen a pro to fix some similar things and have watched a lot of videos on getting stuck and pushing shotssliding. So keep seeing a pro obviously but you can pick at some stuff Ill write hereSome slight early extension which can make you unintentionally work a little more to avoid coming in over the top. Also can lead to a lot of heel contact. I liked I think it was this video  of  where ggswingtips Instagram account shows a lesson with one of his students on stopping sliding. I followed this some getting a little more upright in my stance while still avoiding moving my weight on to my heels which helped me feel a little less cramped and slightly higher up at the top of my backswing helping stop my occasional wrist cupping and actually made swinging feel a lot smoother. I didnt and the pro Ive gone to didnt think my stancespine angle was off at address but just following that helped much more than other early extension drills like an alignment stick behind my butt or one in front of my back knee.Clubface looks open at contact relative to both target and Im pretty certain your swing path so unless you toed this shot its a pushslice. One of the frames near  shows just after impact but also could be a result of twisting due to missing the sweet spot  its tough to tell but the frame before it maybe a foot and a half behind the ball still makes it look like you left it open. Im guessing when you get low hooks its because you get handsy and turn the club over early sometimes.Your takeaway is pretty far on the inside which can lead to you getting stuck too  definitely hard to get to the positions GG was working on in that video coming back like that. In the past Ive had to make sure I checked out my back foot to make sure my feet and hips didnt want to start and finish coming too far on the inside by being a little open toes to the right a bit so I made sure I squared off that back foot. Im sure keeping your feet aiming right a little can help some players that get over the top too much get back on plane or under plane but it definitely hurts me. I didnt realize I had that back toe habit in baseball early in college and I was really confused for a while on why I lost some pull power but was getting a lot of hits spraying to opposite field.Outside of that obviously try to take the clubhead back straight initially and check that parallel position in your backswing.

9178254,0,t3_560am0,I find the number one issue with high handicappers is course management. Never attempt the risky or hero shot. Chip back into the fairway and avoid those big numbers. If the pin is behind a hazard aim away from the trouble. On the green  feet away is much better than in the bunker  or worse. Plot your play for each hole trying to make bogey or double bogey if your shooting in the hundreds. Put your ball in playable locations with clubs youre confident with. w i i i is a perfectly acceptable way to reach a par  if you have trouble breaking  Usually those big scores are because you take a risky shot or make a boneheaded play. Trying to have a reasonable putt at par within  feet should be your goal.Another issue I see a lot is trying to kill the ball instead of just making solid contact. Who cares if the other guy out drives you by  yds every hole if hes in the heavy rough or worse all the time? Making solid contact smooth even swing eye on the ball keeps it in play and out of trouble. Many years ago I played a lot with a guy that couldnt hit it farther than  yds but was always in the fairway and usually putting for par. He shot in the mid to low s EVERYTIME!The other stuff here i.e. short game are also good points. That is were even the single digit handicappers make their scores. Instead of belting driver from the practice range for  minutes spend  minutes at the practice green chipping and putting. When you can consistently chip to within  feet youll make a lot more pars.Good luck and keep at it.,golf,d8fespy,2,t5_2qhcs

9199399,0,t3_56cagh,My goal was to get down to a  by the end of the season but it doesnt look like thats happening. I shot even par on  for the first time this year twice. Once was when I had a holeinone and a birdie making it tough to not go even the other was when I went  on  during a th hole shotgun start where I didnt know when I was technically playing the frontback . Even par is tough.Im right there with you on the difficulty of birdies. Its amazing how much they help lower your score but Im also lucky to get any in a round. There are many ways to get pars but the only real ways to get birdies aside from holing out is to knock approaches very tight or make long putts you dont have any business draining.Come to think of it birdies is probably one of the bigger differences between low and high single digit handicaps. At a  most doubles and blow up holes are eliminated and you just shoot a bunch of pars with a decent amount of well scrambled or just hohum missed one shot bogeys.

9377851,0,t3_590jyh,I dont know what you play regularly and I also dont know if your range imposes limits on ball flight and compression.That being said I highly doubt you are getting enough compression or height on a  yard shot that the limitations on the range ball would come into play.That said a new golf ball will likely go further than a range ball. It will likely also have more spin as the cover of the ball will have less wear and tear and its possible that your regular balls will be softer.You also have to assume that the practice chipping areas greens will be much more firmer than the rest of the courses actual greens.Focus on technique and get creative. Use multiple wedges for all sorts of shots. Find spots where your stance will change from above your feet to below your feet. Hit low shots and high shots.The reality is that this practice feel and experience will be what you rely on for the actual course.Dont worry about the end results on the practice range or chipping green.....and if you are still worried then you should practice with what you play with. Thats what the pros do. For most of us it wont make that much of a difference.I dont play Top Flight or Pinnacle most range balls Ive seen so Im not worried about stopping one from the sand around the chipping green.Focus on technique your swing and impact. Fat or thin will likely be your biggest foes when chipping around the green. ,golf,d94pj8u,5,t5_2qhcs

The reason is they usually arent as athletic as a Jason Day.  They already dont have the flexibility to make a full backswing or throughswing and keeping the head still can make it worse.  When they keep their head still they tend to restrict their swing usually but not always by burying their chin into their chest in an effort to really stay over the ball.  It isnt just a distancekiller but sometimes can bring on accuracy issues because the swing can get out of sequence.There are some good golfers that move their head laterally.  Rocco Mediate is one of them video  Im not a big fan of copying someone elses swing but for the majority of golfers his is more of a swing to emulate than someone like Day or McIlroy.But this also shows that that old saying theres more than one way to skin a cat is kinda true.,golf,d9kte1w,1,t5_2qhcs

Was playing his round with his prosthetic like normal and both were very open about it and we were having fun. Slow day we were coming off a green and saw the group on the next tee also had an amputee except this dude was just playing onelegged and using crutches between shots. He piped one pretty good dead center so while were watching him hit his next shot the kids dad goes look at you cheating with your prosthetic so as soon as they clear the kid tees up rips his leg off hops into position and absolutely stripes one.  easy with perfect balance.

I think the only thing that matters after a pure center hit is the magnitude and direction of the momentum vector imparted to the ball from the club with that vector being perpendicular to the club face. The path of the club face prior to the moment of impact is irrelevant. It is this quantity that determines the flight path of the ball. Assuming both the blade and the perimeter weighted club have the same grooves  I dont see why one would be any better than the other with the exception of factoring in off center hits......,golf,das0yq0,1,t5_2qhcs

9878875,0,t1_dauu0i7, correct. Very steep in the downswing and delivering the handle high at contact to save it. Couple different ways to go at it. Most simple first. hit the inside of the ball. Practice swings with your right foot back to get the feel then step up and hit the inside of the ball. Your body will do the rest. If that doesnt resonate with you or a more complex way of thinking about it follows. You need to flatten out your club shaft in the transition. Instead of your hands moving out towards the ball let them drop straight down without steepening the club shaft. From there you can just rotate  turn your body through the hit letting your club swing out and through the ball. The goal is a shallow inside to our path through the ball. ,golf,dav8oam,2,t5_2qhcs

It was hard to get a photo of the green last night so I made a quick Photoshop of what it looks like right now. I cut my own holes and put little solo cups cut down to size to create a small backboard so the putts dont roll out. This way I didnt have to spend money on an entire platform for a hundred dollars. Now it is completely free to move around if needed. Besides spray painting lines at  increments for speedfeel are there any other cool ideas to mark this thing up for games and other good ways to practice?

10537818,0,t1_dd2j3bx,Maybe Im totally wrong on this but it seems like its near impossible to use a single example to explain this. A course just moving a few bunkers and adding  total yards can completely change the way it plays but there are so many other variables in golf its not easy to statistically measure how those changes affect scoring. That said consider driving distance  years ago only John Daly averaged  and Tiger was  at . Today there are  players topping . When courses try to combat this by lengthening holes it exposes different strengths and weakness of a players game. Essentially what Im trying to get at is that Tiger was great but he was able to be great by performing a decade ahead of the curve. ,golf,dd2ktxb,1,t5_2qhcs

Make sure that wherever you buy them will adjust the lie for free after you take them home and hit them for a bit.

Thats not how the youtube timeline works at all so it makes zero sense that youd think youtube is a better place for swing video analyzing.  Also ububbler youre stupid why would only the downswing and transition be important in a swing video? If you want to be a swing video producer then achieve your dreams but id much rather the entire swing be in slow motion but edited so the swing starts at the very beginning of the video and doesnt linger too long after the swing is completed.  I use slow motion for improving and analyzing my faults not making a slow motion swing video to get likes on social media.

And if you want to actually go into the non forged heads as well they are the game improvement irons which are all either exactly identical or within  deg with their marketplace counter parts not sure where you are getting your numbers... the numbers are all listed and released to the public. i deg i deg etc. Theyre exactly in line with other players clubs. As for club head speeds youre partially on point here. The club head being slightly heavier should not reduce the club head speed at all. In fact as I have said both times it is undetectable. Then through thousands of testers Cobra and numerous testers on youtube and in stores have shown that it has not effected their club speed or club head speeds at all. What it has done is increased ball speed with the heavier club. So my slightly raise the clubhead speed comment verbatim does not make sense you are correct. It should have read slightly increase ball speed which is factually accurate and is what allows for proper gapping. ,golf,ddt1uif,1,t5_2qhcs

11178562,0,t1_deyzoz1,Grooves having a huge impact on your balls spin rate is a common misnomer. They are really there to improve contact when grassdirtwhatever gets between the ball and the club face. Your contact and angle of attackswing speedclub loft is really what drives the spin rate and any losses due to club wear will be in my experience nearly nonexistant unless you are a scratch or better golfer who has near perfect ball striking. I took a look at their life expectancy stuff you were referring to on their website and in the video they having a robot doing their testing. Needless to say the ball striking of a robot will be a bit more consistent than any human and certainly better than someone newish to the game.They say you should consider getting a new wedge after  rounds of play thats a round every  days over the course of a year! due to the difference in performance of the robot mind you  not taking into account that for one youre not a robot and two you have the ability to alter your shots to account for any slight changes in launch angle and spin rate and were talking some hair splitting changes here especially for the new golfer.To me all of this is marketing bullshit meant to trick the consumer into purchasing new product sooner than necessary because a robot proves there is a difference when in reality there is far more at play that will impact your wedge game than slightly worn grooves. I gamed the same set of Vokeys for nearly a decade as a teenager and I know for damn certain my grooves being worn out in those later years were the least of my problems. Dont stress about wear too much and really only look to get your clubs replaced when your game gets to the point where you can actually notice a difference between freshworn grooves.

If you were able to push on both ends of a shaft at the same time with quite a bit of force it would bend under the load. Because the shaft is tapered it would bend at a point closer to the smallerdiameter tip end than to the largerdiameter butt end. A lowkickpoint shaft has this flex point closer to the tip and produces a higher launch angle a highkickpoint shaft has this bend point only about  inches from the low kick point closer to the butt end of the shaft and produces a lower launch angle.I know bend profiles are far more complex that a single point where the shaft kicks but Im not entirely sure what you mean. ,golf,dfhun7f,1,t5_2qhcs

Im not American so Im not versed in the interstices of American commercial law but in a general sense I dont really see any merit in this argument. The USGA is a NGO so they arent an official governing body. The are the government body for golf in the US because people and other organisations accept that they are. Just as we accept that Golf Australia is the governing body here in Australia and the RampA is the governing body in the UK. Nothing is stopping another organisation from competing with them. You could go and make your own rules for golf and set up your own handicap system under a different name if you wanted to. Its more a case that it wouldnt worth trying and compete with them at that scale. That being said there are plenty of organization the offer nonUSGA approved handicap services that effectively serve the same purpose. If youre running an independent golf club you dont necessary have to have a USGA handicap unless you are playing in events held by other organisations or clubs that require you to do so.,golf,dfkdrw1,1,t5_2qhcs

11441138,0,t1_dfslx0n,You hit driver how many times a round why take a really interesting hole and turn it into another hole that you have to hit driver? Most people are more accurate with their ironshybrids. So you say okay this is a par  i need to go for the green but then you have to hit driver? Makes the hole a lot tougher and a lot less playable for the average golfer. I am longer than I am accurate so I wouldnt have a huge issue with a  yard par  but the guy who averages  off the tee they arent going to enjoy the round or the hole as much. Or they should hit from a more forward tee box. I think a course should have a mix of short medium and long par s that test a players iron play. Now things have changed and okay maybe the long par s test hybridwoods but with driver it seems to me personally that you should save that for par s and s. So besides that I think either extend the hole  yards and make it a short par  or shorten the hole to max out at  from the back tees. I played a course last week that was  from the back tees which werent set up that day anyway but played  from the next tees up. It was more enjoyable while also being challenging from that distance than say  yards back.Golf has this sense about par for each hole that cause people to play shots they shouldnt. For your hole a long par  should not have an obstruction in front of it if someone cant get it all the way there they are going to be doubly penalized? If there was a collection area or a bailout area I would be fine with that. That same par  I mentioned had a bailout to the left that you could go for if you didnt want to carry the bunker on the right. Just seems that really good courses balance strategy and design and playability.,golf,dfsuc5p,1,t5_2qhcs

Thats a great private course giving Golfzing members access.  Check out some of the other private courses giving access there too. If you want a hole par  I would head down to play the Terranea links course in Rancho Palos Verdes. I like Rustic Canyon and Angeles National but they are a bit of a drive from you.

Do not underestimate the wind affecting putts.I mainly keep the ball low and look for opportunities to roll the ball where it needs to be.  out?

11752993,0,t1_dgs6te3,gt Spectators who are not at the event should not be able to affect a players score.HOW?!?!?! How? How? How?How would you change the rules of golf?So far youre saying well it would be nice if dickheads at home didnt act like dickheads.Cool story. How are you going to prevent someone from finding a rules violation on TV posting it to Twitter or Facebook or calling event staff at the course and somehow the evidence coming to the attention of an official and then the official ruling on it.How should the rules of golf be updated to fix that? This entire thread started with someone saying they havent changed the rules enough and me saying how should they change them more?.And nobody has answered the question. Theyve just circle jerked about how the rules are bullshit.

11769602,0,t1_dgu3ik9,If I follow you correctly even though your ball starts to the right a good deal that doesnt mean it wont also then hook. Your face could still be very closed relative to your path. You could also just be aimed way right and the ball is starting pretty straight and just hooking badly from there which means your face is fairly square but your path is way insideout,golf,dgu45yn,1,t5_2qhcs

Unfortunately in FL it seems between the heat size of courses many have a pretty long drive between holes and the fact that they stack the shit out of tee times almost forcing you to use carts to keep up its just not conducive to walking. Except my little local  hole that is where carts go to handicapped only. ,golf,dgxh9u9,2,t5_2qhcs
