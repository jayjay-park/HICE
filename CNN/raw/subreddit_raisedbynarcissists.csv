Take only the courses you need for a degree for a grade for the rest audit the class take it for passno pass or self study using the textwebsite unless theres a lab component youre interested in. You want to get optimal grades while really focusing on learning. This will make you ready to ship for your full time job after graduation where the big bucks are made. GET INTERNSHIPS during the summer! This makes getting jobs a whole lot easier. And you learn so much at internships can get some decent pay have fun meet people.If your parents are nice enough to actually support you dont fight that fight the manipulation. I highly recommend that you dont go home for the holidays  youll have tons of excuses bonding with new cliques catching up on reading save money explore town learn to cook too tired sick from finals etc..Also this is up to you but a car isnt always necessary and can be a huge hassle.Learn to feed yourself budget.

39207,0,t3_1ujkmw,I remember feeling like this at a similar stage in my own parental tale.  The thing that I found the most helpful was finally understanding that asking why my parent was being so abusive and undermining was not as important as finally seeing that they were doing it. Id been undermined as a person for years in a form of learned helplessness.  Its the learned helplessness you yourself currently stepped back into by picking up the phone but dont be too hard on yourself  he had to trick and scare you into doing so.Its a good list youve made.  You can rationally objectively see how hes systematically attacked you.  It is good that you can see what has been done to you.  Once there was a time when you would not have seen the emotional abuse for what it is.  It often takes a burn of contact to help revalidate your initial Low Contact decision.  The issue now however is if the FLEAS will pull you down or you will remain yourself.  Be strong.  The personality your parent wants back would never be capable of the list you so eloquently created.As a fellow tea drinker I salute you and wish you well!,raisedbynarcissists,ceiw7pz,6,t5_2we9n

39616,0,t1_ceices2,I actually had to par down what Id written by a half because reddit deemed it too long.  There were a lot more personal accounts in there.  It was really gruesome and even getting the little I have off my chest has been unbelieveably therapeutic since I have never had a real outlet for this.  The only outlet Ive ever had has been family therapy sessions where she dictates everything and everyone screams at each other.  We stopped doing this over a decade ago simply because we got dropped by THREE therapists in one year for literally disturbing the neighbors.  So this is the first time Ive actually had a name for it and people who understand to talk to about it who really listen and even ask questions that are actually relevant.I am planning on going LC and perhaps eventually a more drastic NC in the future.  Right now my mother lives  states away  staying away from her isnt difficult.  It sucks extra because we used to be really close and talk on the phone a lot but she  with this most recent attack  I just realize she hasnt gotten better at all.  Shes gotten worse.  I cant handle it.  Its just too much to hear her tell me its my fault for not telling on him that Im a bully for making her inadvertently feel bad denying any involvement denying any responsibility etc...  Its sickening.  But last year was such a horrible year for me.  I lost my job got black balled in my industry lost a baby late term went through a terrible break up got back together etc...  I mean it was a literally nightmare.  This year I have a wedding and a MUCH anticipated honeymoon in Europe to look forward to and I just dont want any drama.

So the door flew open and I was half shocked didnt expect him to actually do shit. Guess I underestimated the drunkenness. I dipped out into my room and cried for a few minutes in shock and disbelief really never felt safe no wonder I have always been anxious??. This happened maybe  years ago?

I was a skinny kid I just had a typical littlekid tummy.At age  I got You should have been an abortion!At age  For someone like YOU to marry a man who makes less than  per year is SUICIDE!  I have ADD so I am apparently too crippled to contribute anything to a relationship she believes I need a maid a cook and if I have children a nanny.  At age  when I broke it off with the fianc but chose to stay in CO where I had moved to be with him If you choose to stay in CO you will go down the tubes one of her FAVORITE phrases BTW.  The only way for you to be successful is to move back home literally my parents home not the one I OWN and get a job with the Federal Government.  You know because ADD renders you so mentally incompetent you need a job where you basically cant be fired.  Funny Ive never BEEN fired...I could go on but those are my favorites.ETA  I just remembered another SUPER gem I was in my midtwenties and one of my friends well call her D was always on the hunt for the one.  She had met some guy in a local hangout of ours and had a really long intense conversation for hours!  She had given him her number unsolicited and he hadnt given her his.  A few days later she was telling me how she was sure he was the one and though he hadnt called she was POSITIVE it was because he lost her number.  So since she knew his full name and that he owned a construction business in town she looked up the business CALLED HIM AT HIS OFFICE.  The next weekend we saw him at the same restaurant with his wife.  After telling Nmother this story she told me with a very serious OhofcourseIknowwhatsgoingon look on her face Oh.

112943,0,t1_cepnans,I dont know for sure but its possible his lack of trust and accusing you of cheating is projection. I notice myself doing this sometimes with my SO if I feel insecure about my feelings in our relationship I ask him if he loves me or will be with me forever or sarcastically accuse him of wanting to leave me when I know he doesnt. Perhaps he still has desires to have an affair especially given the difficult nature of your relationship at this point for good reason and feels guilty for these thoughts and feelings so hes projecting them on you instead.It does sound like his reactions are having a strong negative impact on you and he certainly seems to be to blame for some of it. Playing devils advocate perhaps you should reach out to a friend or therapist to help you deal with some of your feelings about the affair. Yes he betrayed you but in choosing to work things out you need to be in a process to move forward and forgive. From his perspective it probably feels like youll hold it over him forever and things will never be okay again. I think its perfectly normal to still have a hard time and difficult feelings but being able to confide some of them in someone who is not your husband may help your relationship.,raisedbynarcissists,cerahgr,2,t5_2we9n

125434,0,t3_1vijt2,Thank you for sharing your story. Im so sorry that you had to go through this experience. I wasnt able to talk about this with anyone for years. I just recently opened up to my husband about it for the first time. When I was a kid my Nstepmother HATED my mom and moms sister and mother. She didnt know them but she was constantly telling me they were whores bitches idiots they were all going to hell etc. Nstepmom had also given he the awkward inappropriate sex ed book. I was a shy kid to begin with and super uncomfortable talking about stuff like this. I got my first period when I was  and I committed the mortal sin of being at my aunts house when it happened. She handled it appropriately. Like a loving aunt or mother would. When I got home from my aunts house and told Nstepmom. She was livid. She was pissed at me and told me to go take a shower. She made me show her what they gave me for it. She had to supervise and make sure they gave me pads because only whores use tampons. Nstepmom of course used tampons but she kept them hidden so I guess that made her not a whore. She treated me like crap for days. I was being punished for something that was entirely out of my control. The experience itself is already mortifying enough for a  year old without being bullied about it. From then on she would never buy enough pads. And I too embarrassed to ask. Id always run out and have to ask at the front desk at school because I was to ashamed to ask Nmom. When I was at friends houses Id take a few from their bathrooms and slip them into my purse. She also announced to me in front of my dad and brother that they stink and Im not allowed to throw them in the inside trash any more. So I had to wrap them up and carry them through the house and out to the garage every time. ,raisedbynarcissists,cespre7,10,t5_2we9n

155516,0,t3_1vun3c,I too have noticed in people that used to make me cringe when they mentioned they wanted a baby but the kids and pets too they already had were borderline neglected and abused remember the public appearance here. I never knew why but maybe deep down I sensed these people were Ns like my mother who would only want the pet or child for the attention as well as the added benefit of that living being not questioning it. I see it in my own Nmother in many different formats all depending on the needs she has at the time.When I was growing up Nmother got pets for me. I was the reason she only got the animal and this was the game she would play when I would not know how to take care of the animal no one taught me. Then as I got older the animals slowly became hers. Once I got the eff out of the house and got married Nmother immediately went out and bought a puppy. I knew it was a replacement for me and especially a nasty kick in the teeth at the time since I was pregnant too. It was as if she was in competition with me over my baby so she had to get a puppy to have a baby too. However she gave me such shit about how you have to change your ways and not be so selfish while she locked the dog in my old room while she was at work justifying how she didnt see that as animal abuse since she had to work so hard and such long hours and no one would help her out ever blah blah blah blah. Now here I am as a  year old adult getting compared to a dog. Yup I have become the official SG and the dog has become the GC for it wont argue back with her or worse tell her to her face that she is wrong or being racist. Its all about the dog now and you know what I am so fucking glad. I see her for what she is and I dont want anything else from her ever again. She can have her dog that once again is left to being taken care of by HER own mother. I guess I see her even more for what she is my own Nmother and really find that it does still hurt to see her do this to me or to my son. ,raisedbynarcissists,cew5834,2,t5_2we9n

164562,0,t3_1vxfgs,Im pretty sure my mom isnt an N maybe with N tendencies or afflicted with fleas? as her stepmother treated all the stepkids pretty poorly favoring her own kids much more grandfather had two wives which was culturally accepted at the time in Hong Kong... I think.  My moms mom is the second wife which culturally is the lesser of the two.Anyway a few instances really stand out.When I was in my late teens my uncle dads younger brother who my mom did not like for some reason asked if we could record some Disney movies for his young kids since we had a rather extensive collection.  Mom was in a kinda bad mood at the time so I sent my youngest sister probably like a GC to go up and retrieve the tapes while I watched from the stairs.  She apparently knocked a fan over in the process and when my mom found out what she was doing mom balled her fists up with arms rigidly at her side shook head stomped her feet and screamed at us that we werent allowed to record any tapes for him.  I think my sister beat a hasty retreat and I followed in her wake but that was the epitome of a childs tantrum.  Maybe that of a  year old except it was from a woman in her late s.More recently I went on a trip to Hong Kong with my family.  A friend suggested I go to this shopping center in Mong Kok to buy cheap film for instant camera.  I mentioned it to my dad since I have no idea where things are in Hong Kong and he said sure lets go.  So one of our first days in Hong Kong we are in the general area and have about an hour and a half to kill before dinner.  My dad suggested we stop by Mong Kok to look for the film.  I declined but my dad kept insisting since we really had nothing else to do except wander around.After maybe  minutes of him asking me if I wanted to go to Mong Kok I said OK just to shut him up. Except Hong Kong is like a clusterfuck Times Squares lined back to back for miles and its not like I knew exactly where to look so we walked around trying to find the shopping center.  Found what might be it and went in but it was super crowded.  Mom started getting a little antsy and asked why were there.  My dad told her its because I wanted to go there and look for film.  This pissed me off because now my dad was redirecting my moms anger at me even though he was the one who insisted we all make this stupid trip to look for some stupid film.  Anyway I told them they can just wait and Ill go look.  Little sister comes but she clearly thinks we should go back.  So we do and Im without my film.  Mom says something about how it was a waste of time.  Wanting to diffuse the rage I tell them Im not hungry and am going to go back to the hotel early and they can go have dinner.  Dad seemed a little upset but I insisted and left.Fast forward two weeks later on our last day in Hong Kong I have a free day of wandering around Hong Kong while my parents did their own thing with the plan of meeting up for dinner.  I saw some girls  playing around with the same kind of instant camera so I asked them where they got their film.  They marked the spot on a map I had so I felt pretty good about finally being successful then head out to meet up with my parents.  Told them about the girls and the film and that I wanted to give another try.  Went to two shopping buildings taking maybe  minutes tops and didnt find the film.  Came down empty handed and my mom very angrily said that if I cant find the goddamn film then the camera is useless and I should just throw it out.For some reason that really set me off.  I first got generally upset then pissed then I started crying.  I really wanted to leave but my dad would be SO SAD about not having dinner together as a family.  So Im sitting at the fucking table very clearly crying and everyone ignored this except my other sister whos kinda like the SG who gave me packets of tissues.  After a few minutes my dad asked is something wrong?  Jesus fucking christ.  After dinner I tell them Im going to go back to the hotel myself.  My dad simply either doesnt get why I would want to do that even after I explain to him why Im upset.  His reason You know mom is like this so just accept it and dont let it bother you.  Fuck man YOU can be her doormat of a husband but Im not going to just take her completely unprecedented verbal tantrums.  Mom looked like she understood why but was holding her ground and not saying anything while I was trying to get away.Since then my mom has not once acknowledged that she overreacted probably because she doesnt think she has.  She might be trying to make things up to me by buying me groceries when shes at Costco but that still doesnt change the fact that I really dont want to spend much time with her or my dad.  And my dad is still flabbergasted as to why Im not keen on going on another family vacation.Holy shit that was a lot longer than I had intended to type.,raisedbynarcissists,cex6cjq,3,t5_2we9n

The fact that one thing is worse than another doesnt mean the other thing is good the fact that one thing is better than another doesnt mean the other thing is bad.Second that generalization is not valid.

184094,0,t1_cezef8k,Hi Im the wife of an ACON. I grew up in a loving household. I had to learn the hard way about his father because he never told me anything and after a few years his dad started getting jealous of me and acting out.I never knew anything was wrong before that because his dad was on his best behavior near me and my now husband would never say anything about that stuff. I wish I had known earlier because I had been pushing him to stay in contact with his father because I hadnt the slightest idea of what was going on there or even wrap my head around it for the longest time.I found out when his dad almost hit me because I was tidying up the kitchen and dropped a cup.I wish I had more warning about what was going on there.EDIT As it is now I still dont know everything that is going on because I dont ever ask him to tell me anything. We just have natural conversations while watching TV movies or reading and he reacts in a certain way and we have a discussion about it. I dont know the reasoning behind most of what he thinks or does and I probably will never know because he isnt the kind of person to open up about things. But saying my parents are abusive and toxic will now hold MUCH more weight because of how they have acted towards her finally. I have been with my husband for almost  years now.

Whether its a  year old or an  year old portraitist people can feel particularly raw amp sensitive right after sharing an artistic creation of their own. Having it shat on is the kind of thing that can just stick with you and it might take a lot of consistent support to heal that particular hurt feeling.Also be careful not to lay it on so thick that it sounds like youre just placating her. Keep it sincere. Tell her you loved her performance and tell her why you loved it. Every time try to find out a new aspect or two that you particularly liked.

216469,0,t3_1wlf1l,Yes individuals with NPD are often in therapy. But usually for secondary issues such as depression anxiety not having satisfactory lives etc. It can be extremely difficult to diagnose however as all they hear are patients side of stories. A lot of times though the relationship between patient and therapist becomes a proxy for what happens in the patients real life. Thus if a narcissist has a hard time hiding their tendencies from others there is a good chance they wont be able to hide that from a fairly welltrained therapist. Depending on how dominant the patient is andor how prepared the therapist is the therapeutic relationship can devolve into a Youre here to tell me what I want to hear because Im paying you type of situation. The question however is the benefit of telling such a patient that you believe they have NPD. In many cases that would shatter rapport and ruin the therapeutic relationship. In many other cases it may be the only way to help them see their extremely maladaptive and abusive behavior. In any case it needs to be a very careful conversation given that a narcissist has their own ideas about what is going on with them. People with NPD often rebel against and quit therapy when they perceive their therapist to be critical of their behavior. Timing and rapport are key.,raisedbynarcissists,cf33mcy,30,t5_2we9n

217675,0,t3_1wltq0,Your theory is bangon. Perfectionism is basically a form of obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD. And OCD is really about control. It typically develops in people who feel that they have very little control in their lives and is a form of overcompensation. To counter overwhelming feelings of lack of control and the tremendous anxiety this generates these people endeavour to have as much control as possible over various situations or behaviors in their lives. This may be simply to experience a sense of control in some aspect of their life when they otherwise have none or more often to also protect themselves from threats ie from previous traumatic experiences occurring again. Even things like eating disorders eg anorexia fall under this control dynamic. Many young people who struggle with anorexia are also struggling with a general sense of powerlessness in their lives. Their ability to restrict their food intake as tremendously unhealthy as it is actually gives them a rare sense of control and empowerment when their lives are otherwise lacking these qualities. As an aside eating disorders dont just occur out of the blue. There is often dysfunction in these peoples families.I should be clear that perfectionism exists on a sliding scale and it doesnt necessarily indicate fullblown OCD. Regardless its easy to see how these tendencies would develop in people like us. As kids we got burned and traumatized so many times and each experience caused us to try harder and go to greater lengths to prevent them from happening again. Of course they happened again anyway. And so we then went to even greater lengths after that eventually trying to cover every base and anticipate everything possible in order to protect ourselves.Lastly to answer your question YES I have struggled bigtime with perfectionism myself. Its less of a problem for me now than it used to be. I also have fullblown OCD.Best wishesEDIT typo,raisedbynarcissists,cf38kxf,3,t5_2we9n

I made lego dogs bulldogs labradors shepherds daschunds. They were all relative in size to each other. My three special dogs were replicas of our dog who had died our current dog who my mom would later kill and an almost lifesize terrier I had made from using every last grey brick. I was also especially proud of some realistic trophies I had madeproportional cups with bases and again scaled to each other gold silver and bronze. The gold one even had minihandles. I remember showing them to my mom and she was unimpressed. They were just legos. No big deal. She could do that. Disappointed I worked on reinforcing the bulldog getting the thick shoulders with a proportional neck had resulted in a flimsy base. Maybe once she saw I made it sturdy then maybe shed approve. I spent all night trying to work out a design. Aha! Finally found one!! I put my collection side by side satisfied. No matter what my mom thought I was proud. The next day after coming in from playing outside I went to my room. My entire collection was gone removed from the corner of my room. I ran downstairs to ask my mom what happened. She said she had vacuumed my room and the legos were in her way. She put them in a bin in the closet. So I go check my closet thinking she had stored them safely away. Nope. Every single one of my creations had been destroyed. Crushed pulled apart gone beyond recognition. While sifting through Id notice two clumped together that had probably been a leg or the thin square that represented a collar pressed against what used to be a neck. Otherwise it was total destruction. I asked why she did that. She said legos were meant to be taken apart. I said I had built them and wanted to keep them. She said they had been ugly and she did me a favor.I dont understand how Ns get off from being cruel. It amazes me how casually browsing this sub brings in so many stories I can relate to.

For reasons unbeknownst to me my Nmom flipped a shit and kicked us both out of the house in the middle of the night claiming that he was trying to ruin my life with marriage. The only way I was able to get back in was if I promised to break up with him and cut off all contact.After that night she made my life a miserable hell for the six months that I stayed there. The tamest things she called  me were an ingrate and a hateful child. As if this wasnt bad enough I was dealing with depression and bullying at my school and turned to self harming as a way to cope. My Nmom openly mocked me for it called me weak and got the rest of the family to do so as well. She threatened to sue the school who had tried to intervene and cut me off from the world by taking away the phone my boyfriend had bought me the phone my grandmother had given me and my computer. I was stuck there until I moved out for college.,raisedbynarcissists,cf4kosa,1,t5_2we9n

235379,0,t1_cf550dw,For the most part yes and no the rules were written for him but were to be respected by everything.  He has insane periods of lashing out with my parents and at one point last year he lied about locking the door on the way to the dentist with my mother and my dog got out because the door doesnt latch properly.  He tried to arrange to hang out with friends who arrived at our house before we did and they saw my dog running out and helped her back inside.  My dog couldve been hurt and his response to that was Shes gonna die soon anyways look at her shes old! and its been several months since that happened now and shes still a hearty dog.After that incident when they got home from the dentist my mom said to have his friends wait and he could hang out with them at our house supposedly they needed to pick up their brother in a town  minutes away.  Well when they get home and my mom goes to the bathroom my brother sneaks out and these people were supposedly waiting for him in close proximity to the house and my mom calls him and within three minutes hes magically on the other side of that minuteaway town already.  After calling and calling him telling him hes grounded and needs to come home he turns his phone off the next time he turned his phone on he tried bribing my mom with dinner and he ultimately came home shortly after midnight and they got into this huge argument.  He said that my parents suffocate him and he went into the city where he was there for some eight hours or something.  I have no idea what he was doing nor do my parents but they didnt know who he was with or whether he was safe so take that with a grain of salt.  Maybe they care but they could be a bit more lax in enforcing these rules on everyone.  I dont like feeling like Im watched especially since Im a legal adult I shouldnt have to be checking in with mom every hour.

I was a parking lot attendant retail clerk and student temp in a finance office. Of course to her these were terrible choices. I helped referee the local youth soccer and hockey clubs to which she said I cant understand for the life of me why you do that!After college and now ever further away  miles I worked in hospitality for a few years had a second job for awhile at a grocery store moved to the next town over was in hotels retail railway even a jail guard for a year!... none of these were real jobs...Then I decided about . years ago to do what I always wanted to try since I was a kid. I always said nothing for fear of the backlash and imminent humiliation... so I applied passed the entry requirements and on a nice fall day got the call I had been accepted. I told my friends I told my employer who was very supportive of the entire process and finally  days before moving to my new job across the country I called me NM to say I am starting a new career. I report to basic training in  days.Granted I never gave them much time to process it... but it was too late. My papers were signed travel orders given apartment packed up and everything cleared. She sighed said Well Im not so sure about that. My friends kid is in the Army and they dont like it... and she gave a few more examples of how bad it was. Screw her she wasnt raining on my parade.

I could not face another day in my old life. Could not take it anymore. I dont want to hurt their feelings by going seriously LC of course in their eyes Im already LC because my new boyfriend isolates me. They cant stand not having complete control of my life. What sucks is I used to have such a fighter spirit.  When I was in high school I remember standing up for myself and my autonomy. I would tell my friends My dad cant stand me because he tries to control me with fear and Im not afraid of him!

262858,0,t3_1x3j9s,The straw that broke this camels back with my nM as it relates to our wedding was her behaviour during the sample meal.Picture this you have just sampled each of the SIX courses that will be served at the wedding. You have tasted a sampled antipasto buffet gnocchi in two different sauces a white alla vodka and a red top sirloin chicken cordon bleu mussels in a white wine sauce arugula salad strawberry shortcake lemon gelato and espresso.She begins by saying that the gnocchi being served side by side is too boring and that for more flair it should be served with a swirl in the middle for some sort of yin and yang effect or some shit. She then complains that her steak is undercooked. While everyone else was fine with a medium rare to medium well steak I had asked in advance for her steak do be cooked well done. It was. It has never mattered how well done her steak has been cooked when she has eaten out she always demands it be cooked further to encourage more attention be shown to her. Today is no different. Fine whatever enjoy your piece of charcoal. She then complains that some of the mussels were only partially open yes that means theyre cooked sufficiently you imbecile. Finally she makes the comment to end all comments about the espresso. This was the comment that I felt absolutely mortified and embarrassed by especially in front of my inlaws...She complains that the espresso beans were overroasted and tasted burnt okay fine they can roast a new bag even though this is a figment of your imagination. Her second espresso also tastes burnt. She calls over the server and after making sure we were all listening she says to himThis espresso is still burnt! I would be embarrased to serve that to my guestsKeep in mind one important fact the only people paying for this wedding were my wife me and my inlaws. She hadnt put up one thin dime. This entire elaborate meal though it was a good price because I know how to haggle and bargain hunt was done to placate her demands for a big Italian wedding my inlaws are not Italian and are as waspy as they are awesome.My father in law was visibly being restrained by my MIL from tearing her a new asshole verbally. I kind of wished he had. It was a long drive back to drop her back off at her house a house I would never drive to again. She saw I was fuming on the inside and had the audacity to ask why. I decided to turn her own mindfucks on her by saying simply if you cant figure out why thats an even bigger problem.As I was living with my inlaws at the time yes before the wedding since they decided I wasnt allowed to be abused anymore...seriously theyre awesome I saw my FIL and MIL the next morning along with some aunts and uncles of my wifes who had started to trickle in for the week before the wedding to make a vacation out of it. My MIL waits until Im alone and says dont worry about last night its on her not you. Shes not allowed to hurt you anymore because youre one of us now and gives me a teary hug. My FIL similarly says that he really wanted to tell her off for her classless words and while she wasnt worth holding back I was.Im getting a little glossy eyed typing this at my desk but since then Ive come to think of my nM in the context of this quote from the first Terminator movie when Kyle Reese is trying to explain the gravity of what The Terminator is to Sarah ConnorIt cant be bargained with.

If hes been continually putting himself at risk by associating with drug addicts hed be better in a more formallysupervised setting. That said you may also be able to get help supervising him by contacting APS and asking what the options are. Some may be able to provide you with a subsidy to compensate you for staying there and keeping him independent some may bring a trained nurse or aide to assist you or live in with him.

I do not have that ability and should try and save myself first before others.But I will be leaving her in a few months and moving over five thousand miles away from all of them and hope that maybe with the distance and time I will be able to form a better relationship with my siblings and possibly even father though I doubt it will happen,raisedbynarcissists,cf946rr,2,t5_2we9n

I mean I was aware of it somewhat vaguely but she really blew me away with that.And its okay to say that you dont want medication! I told my therapist that the first thing I saw her and she said that was fine. The people Im going to right now primarily use CBT which IIRC has been said is one of the better methods to treat children of narcissists. The purpose of therapy isnt to spill your guts and have the therapists sympathize with you although if you need validation about my experiences like I do than it is a part of it but its also about working together to create methods to deal with your FLEAS and other things left over from your childhood.Either way I wish the best for you.

I wish I could give you a lot of hope for the future but this situation has been the hardest mental health situation Ive ever been in and my family and I have gone through supporting my dad through  serious hospitalizations while he has had to get his bipolar meds adjusted. Basically my boyfriend is just starting to come to terms with his Nmoms behaviors and he has been in therapy for a year now. Weve been together for  years and my bf and I have only been fully aware of his moms NPD for about  years now. But there were warning signs and major issues from the very start. I have soooo many stories. It is such a tough place to be in and the more my bf goes to therapy and tries to put up boundaries with his mom the more push back we get from her amp the enabling family members. Again I wish I could offer more cheery advice but based on what you said it seems your suspicions are correct about her. If there is any way you can get your bf to start therapy I think that might be a good move. If you can encourage him to talk to his sisterinlaw and his brother that might help open his eyes. My advice to you is to document EVERYTHING. If you can present your bf with a few months worth of odd behavior he may notice a patternbe willing to see there is a problem. My bfs Nmom has tried to tear my bf and I apart almost from day one. All holidays are a nightmare his Nmom resents me and calls me every name in the book his Nmom resents my entire family just bc my bf spends time with them amp doesnt run back to her saying that he hates my family. His Nmom also engages heavily in gaslighting both me and my bf trying to make us feel crazy for remembering things she says or does. My bf even jokes that he must just be a filthy rememberer bc of how much she belittles him for bringing up anything from the past. My bf is definitely a trooper though! He is soldiering through all this amp is being vigilant with his therapy. I hope you can experience a similar outcome. Best of luck!

Ive always felt compelled to fix things that were broken toys I had as a kid electronics etc.. I just recently realized thats kind of what Ive been doing with this situation. In a way I think I was trying to figure out why she acts in such a bizarre way and trying to rationalize her actions to determine her motivation. In the end I might as well be banging my head against a wall because its no use. I kept trying to salvage my relationship with her but getting nowhere.I really appreciate the advice I will try to take it to heart. I feel paralyzed by a lot of selfdoubt when it comes to making big decisions so its nice to have some sort of starting point. I honestly felt overwhelmed at the time I posted this but I really feel like I can do this now! I just need to get motivated.Im feeling a lot better now.

487528,0,t1_cfv7mwm,My mother would do something sort of similar when I was in my midlate teens.  It was the amount and frequency rather than the content.  Shed comment on how healthy whatever I was eating was and scold me for having multiple servings of carbohydrates a day etc.  Every time I tried to get food from the kitchen if she heardsaw shed show up and make some comment on it.  Every night a dinner shed stare at me while I ate and comment on my food the order I ate it in take more servings of broccoli no you cant have another of rice etc.  When I wasnt eating shed get after me about it every time she saw me  what did I eat when did I eat why didnt I eat betterevery doctor told me my diet was extremely healthy for a teenager but nothing satisfies NM etc.  Shed get after me about sneaking food avoiding her forbid me to take food out of the kitchen etc.  Eventually I developed an such anxiety response to her and food together that I became incapable of eating around her.  My appetite would vanish completely even if I hadnt eaten for six hours.  Id try to swallow food but couldnt  it was like my throat had become to small for food to fit when she was watching me seriously she never believed me but swallowing would just not work anymore some sort of psychosomaticanxiety thing.  She was furious with me of course but her staring and me and demanding over and over that I eat that I swallow the food successfully none of that did anything but make it worse.  So I ended up barely eating unless I could sneak food away and not get caught by her because I could physically not eat in front of the woman anymore.  Eventually she did relent somewhat and let me eat on my own but to this day I lose my appetite if I so much as hear her voice and I have very little appetite to begin with.  I still go long amounts of time without eating.  Worst of all I have a lot of trouble eating healthily because I look at vegetables and I think of my mother.  I know every one of her opinions on every damn vegetable.  I hear her telling me to eat this other one instead of that one why dont you eat more of this one and demanding that I eat this one before I start on the rest of my meal.  I look at fruit and I hear her tell me it has too much sugarcarbs.  I look at a salad and hear all her problems with iceberg lettuce.  I think I should geteat some vegetables and I hear her berating me about ever daring to eat anything else.  So now I cant eat healthily and have trouble eating at all.

495434,0,t1_cfwknyo,Ive been going to a therapist on campus to see if I could get some help there but her services have been just worthless. She always acts annoyed to deal with me cuts our sessions short every time and really doesnt do anything but listen to me talk. Id go to another therapist but I go to school in a super small town so I figure theres not much of a selection and I cant afford to go to a place outside of school. I want to go to an actual doctor and see if I can be prescribed medication for my anxiety and depression but again I just figure Ill call the wrong place or ask for the wrong thing. But yeah I totally get what you mean about feeling inadequate and figuring you only got some things because they randomly had lower expectations for you. I worked the same job for over two years in high school and I never got promoted. I worked my ass off and did more for my workplace than some of the managers did and I bitched about not being promoted all the time because I knew in my head I deserved a promotion. Most of my coworkers agreed that I should have been promoted too and they told me I should ask or store manager if he was willing to promote me. that was an acceptable thing at my workplace it was pretty chill I never did because I just figured I wasnt actually good enough and that Id just get laughed at if I asked. The manager threw an absolute fit when I quit too so I know he most likely would have given me a promotion if I had just asked. But again why do I deserve recognition for my work? Im not perfect I dont deserve to be rewarded. So I just never bothered.,raisedbynarcissists,cfwl22t,1,t5_2we9n

531687,0,t3_207jk2,Your mother sounds really nasty and she sounds like she really wants to disapprove of you no matter what you do.  I dont think that changing your schedule is going to fix this because your mother is deeply broken in such a way that nothing you do is going to change anything in the longterm for her.  My advice is to do what you need to do.  Dont change your schedule for a person who is just going to keep complaining and either pretend you did nothing to accomodate her or just flip to complaining about something else.  Parents like this keep moving the bar so that you can never get to where they think you are supposed to be.  But even if she was a nice mother should you change your whole schedule to accomodate her?  I dont think a normal mother would ask this of you.  In healthy relationships both parties work to meet eachother in the middle.  Your mother on the other hand seems to just want to poke at you and make you feel bad for her own sick pleasure.  This is not the kind of person you should be turning your life upsidedown for.

When she found out my dad had cheated on her before their marriage and divorced him she went crazy.

574648,0,t3_20p08x,Yeah this shit is terrible please dont dance around the word mom and think she deserves any breaks here. What she did wasnt just abuse it was illegal. A lot of us cant get justice for emotional abuse or past physical abuse. But you can get justice for what your mom did to you.Im not sure how old you are now but I really hope shes old enough not to be able to have any more kids. Either way please go to the police about this. There might not be enough evidence to prosecute your mom and all these other sick fucks sleeping with an underage girl. But there will be enough cause to maybe set you up in an independent living program.If she doesnt already do this to your sister if you leave the situation entirely you risk your sister being made to do the same things as you bc thats what selfish manipulative bitches do. This is something big and something more than you can handle. Just walk into any police station and say youre caught up in a mess you cant handle with your mom request a female officer to speak to and go from there. Itll be a step toward the justice and peace you deserve.They will also probably set you up with a counselor to speak to. After all the shit youve been put through I would use that resource. Itll give you a way to deal with the anger shame which you shouldnt be feeling but I understand if you are and other terrible feelings youre enduring because of this.Lastly Im most sad to hear about the cycle of do thiswait now Im pissed off even though you did it and Im going to yell and throw you out in my personal cycle it was beaten for hours but I think the psychological effect is the same on a kid  sense of fear feeling worthless etcokay now Ill apologize and make you feel safe againYeah...that kind of cycle done to a kid for years is really really shitty. One it caters to a borderline personality later hot and cold overwhelming good feelings overwhelming bad feelings bipolar is another option to come out of it. You might feel anxious when someone isnt angry with you because youve had this cycle in your head for so long that you arent sure what its supposed to be like otherwise. Conversely you might take someones small amount of anger at you to extreme levels because youre just used to people being mad at you. My dad had two modes. Rage and disappointment. Or love. And the only way he showed his love was crawling into my bed at night.Ive learned as an adult that when a child has every single aspect of their life turned into some kind of negativity except one in this case when you hand your mom money or agree to do these terrible sexual things its going to severely mess with your sexuality and personal relationships later unless you seek counseling. Im not saying this to scare you or hurt some already terrible wounds. Im saying it because I went through something similar and know what it did to me as an adult. And because I know the way our healthcare system is set up in the US anyway its way easier to get help as a kid than as an adult.So please. Go to the police and then insist on some counseling.

Should I kill the farmer in town who planted two different crops side by side or should I report it to the police? Then I would tell her to keep her damn nose out of other peoples business. But then again Im a really petty bitchy person to people I dislike so dont do that.Seriously best bet would be to just politely tell her that youll talk to him when youre ready and ask her to stay out of your business. ,raisedbynarcissists,cgf8prc,6,t5_2we9n

Plus its kind of hard for me to openly empathize when Im hyperaware of the fact that my mom is hearing everything I say.I guess Im used to operating on one set of fairly strict rules and its weird when Im home with her and its a whole different thing. That kind of stuff usually doesnt come up because frankly I dont have much of a social life when Im home with her.

672692,0,t3_21tdox,No. God fucking hell no. I didnt get beat or physically abused as much as my sister though I still did  she used to beat me with a yard stick until the yard stick broke and throw chairs at me but all of my NMoms energy was focused on me. My sister got hours and days were she was left alone to watch TV and hang out with friends while my mom drilled classes into me and drove me to every single after school she could. My sister had no expectations I had to do everything. I had to be perfect or shell whale on me. I had to be smart play the piano perfect I had to be pretty. I was constantly told I was too dumb too lazy too fat.  By high school I was a neurotic mess. I hated my mom I hated my life. I wanted to jump out a window I was anorexic for a year. All throughout childhood I would lock myself in the bathroom and silently weep. I got out as soon as I could and never looked back. My sister didnt have an easier time. She was constantly belittled she used to be told she would never amount to anything punished much much worse than I was and I always got the clothes parties and nice stuff while she got nothing. But it was different not necessarily better or worse. I use to resent my SG sister but that was partly because she bullied me partly because my mom pit use against each other and partly because she would not stop provoking my mom and challenging her while I just rolled over like a kicked puppy. Our relationship has gotten better now that weve both matured and gone to college.Oddly enough my sisters gotten the GC treatment now that Ive left and gone LC and refused to accept more than a  minute a week phone call from her.

I can sympathize with re learning to be an adult after being away from your FOO it takes time but then you realize e normalcy of so many things you were lead to believe were crazy. Anyway... For your own good Id look into becoming a little more zen over not letting people use your things.. As despite it being conditioned behavior and likely not your fault it is still a really damaging trait. Its the type of stuff Nmoms do and they just want minimes to follow in their footsteps. In time you may find it even turns into a bit of N in your own relationships... It is damaging and as ACoN we need to be the ones to break the cycle. The first step is realizing..

No one thought she was doing anything wrong and that still scares me. Someone gave me the name of this super old man lawyer and I took one look at his picture and was just like fuck no. Old men love her and think she can do no harm she loves old men. Pretty much any other kind of person would be better. Old man lawyers have been thinking shes been doing the right thing all along.

I wriggled into the top of this silo expecting it to be swarming with black widow spiders and scorpions but it was dry as a bone with a little bit of rust and dust.  I settled myself in listening to the sound of the rain as it battered the old metal container.  I stayed in there long after the rain had passed.  I returned many times over the next few years.  It became my very favorite place to read.

702143,0,t3_2275lm,It takes a while after being away from the direct influence of N parents and after time to go over bad experiences with other people to figure out where it went wrong to have smart intuition about who is potentially a psychopath or NPD. It takes even longer to know what to do with that intuition once it is more accurate. First identifying a potential psychopath or someone with NPD or other PD early on. . They want to get close very quickly. They want to know personal stuff about you especially your pain. And they will tell you personal stuff about them. Its a way to get close quickly and to have something on you they can manipulate. Not all people who get close quickly are Ns or psychopaths they could be codependent or just really nosey but its an early indicator. . They dont like or respect boundaries. If they ask something and you tell them you dont want to talk about it or you try to deflect yet they keep trying to get you to open up they dont respect your boundaries. They tell you things that really only close family should know and are surprised if you are uncomfortable and expect you to be very comfortable with them from the get go. . They make you feel guilty. Ns and psychopaths rely on other peoples sense of guilt to control them. They dont feel guilt themselves for different reasons but they both know that other people do and its something they can get from someone. Ns dont know they know this  its instinctual psychopaths know exactly what they are doing.. They act like they know you well when they dont. They say things like I can tell you are really smart. or I can tell that you dont get along with your parents. They are using a reading technique thats similar to what fortune tellers do as a way to weasel in and get information from you and get close without you knowing. . They talk badly about other people especially to create closeness with a common dislike for someone else. This is particularly true for Ns but psychopaths will do this too if they sense that it will work with you. Codependents which most ACoNs are grab on to this quickly usually because its the primary way that Ns communicate. ACoNs are comfortable with this kind of closeness its familiar from their parents doing it so psychopaths will use it as they can tell when someone likes something. . They do not listen or validate or they overly listen and validate. Ns either dont let you talk or dont listen to you when you do. They change the subject to themselves often.  When you explicitly try to bring the topic to what you want to talk about they may even get irritated and annoyed. Psychopaths are a little different in that they will talk about you in order to seem interested and get you talking about yourself so they can suck you in and get info on you. Ns are in the conversation to feel good psychopaths are in the conversation to see how they can use it to their advantage and to feel you out.. They dont like it when you disagree or they are overly gushing about your opinion. Ns do not like to be wrong. They do not like. At all. Psychopaths dont care if they are told they are wrong so long as they get to keep manipulating. Psychopaths only get angry when they cant manipulate anymore. Early on they will say you are right and gush on you in order to suck you in. Try disagreeing nicely with your new person and see what happens. Healthy people hold on to their own opinions while at the same time allowing others to have theirs.Id say none of these are instant indicators of either N or psychoapthy but they are clues. The more a person has the more likely they are one or the other  or at least something is not safe about this person even if they arent fully psychopath or fully N. Everyone has N traits and everyone can exhibit behavior that is not right from time to time. A oneoff is not a conclusive indicator of a disorder. But if there are multiple indicators and it happens each time you talk to them odds are something is up. So now what do you do if your spidey senses go off and you think a person might not be a safe person to be around?. Keep up your boundaries. Know your boundaries with anyone what you are willing to be OK with what you arent and defend them from minute . Defend them lightly at first of course but definitely make them clear. . Get rid of the idea that everyone has to like you. Or that you have to like everyone. Consider the first dozen or so interactions as a kind of probation period for all new people. Be yourself be respectful but keep up new person boundaries for a while until you see them interact in many different situations with different people and have had a chance to disagree with them a couple of times. . Its OK to excuse yourself and say no to an invite. Learn ways to excuse yourself from a conversation if you start to feel uncomfortable as a way to create some space. Also its OK to say no to an invite once in a while if you dont have the energy to keep up the boundaries you need with that person. BTW if they dont like that you are doing this that is a huge red flag that this person isnt safe. Stay farther away.. Seek out other peoples opinion of the person. Odds are if you arent comfortable likely others arent either. Also you can get a sense of how other people handle it and what the limits of the persons behavior might be based on stories that people tell about them. . Have people you do trust in your life and think often about why you trust them. . Realize that nobody has perfect spidey sense. Youll be wrong sometimes and a really cool person will set off the red flags at the beginning and someone really terrible was able to slip past your boundaries. It happens. Dont beat yourself up about it. Once you realize it happened set the boundaries again create space and be clear about where it was that they crossed the line so next time youll be smarter about it. Im very good at reading people now ACoNs actually are but often we dont know what to do once weve read someone. We most often have the opposite reaction that what we should do  try to fix them get close to be safe open up because someone finally wants to know about us etc. and Im good at handling people who are clearly unsafe but it took a while. You can do it too.,raisedbynarcissists,cgk3450,9,t5_2we9n

Did you ever confront your mother about it  either then or now as an adult?I know this is no conciliation but it might keep you from becoming too bitter to think about what Meowminx wrote that Plenty of people do first teenage experiences in their thirties and also the fact that many people more than you may realize feel that they didnt have a normal childhoodteenage experience due to serious family issues to being bullied to being gay to being different in any way...

Looking back Im starting to question more and more whether I was mentally ill at all or if I was simply a scared teenager who didnt understand that how I was living wasnt normal. They did such an effective job raising me to have no skills to cope having no trust in myself or my memories forcing emotional repression from pure fear causing disassociation and suicidal tendencies. Im only just now realizing that my life may not have been a story of poor depressed teen goes to the psych ward because she tried to kill herself and instead is a story of ongoing mental and emotional manipulation by the very people I should have been able to trust most. Since going off most of my medicine down from  pills a day to one and  half and getting on hormonal birth control I have had moments of happiness that Id never experienced before and their manipulation is becoming more and more apparent to me since Ive come out of my pharmaceuticalinduced fog. Long story short they have control and at  years old with no license no car and no job Im struggling to find my way out of this pit that theyve dug for me.

It really sucked having to wrap up my first microscope and give it some other kid in my class that I got invited to his birthday...I dont even remember that kids name thats how close we were as friends. When I got older and stopped recieving birthdayholiday gifts my mom would take me along on her shopping sprees.

I figure Im hacking my own desire for food.I wonder if such a thing might be helpful for you  you seem to be already treating the plate as your serving buffet serving yourself onto a smaller plate.

I realize I need to just do it buy a bunch of cheap crappy wood and make some small thing. Part of my problem is lack of money but part is just the fear that I wont do it right and Ill be unhappy with the results. I believe much of this comes from the ridicule I was subjected to while growing up. And if I brought this to Nmoms attention shed insist that whatever she said was encouragement to do better or some BS like that. But last week I started a project Ive been putting off for some time making a platform to use at the top of my stairs to extend the landing so I can use my stepstool to reach the light that is directly over the second step from the top. I bought the materials about a year ago and have done nothing with them until last week.I remember one time I was staying at her house for a vacation most of my vacations have been spent at her place because she believes that she is entitled to all of my time off  Im  BTW I asked her how to set her microwave to so something specific  use a lower level of power or something. Her reply was something along the lines of Oh as smart as you are I thought youd know how. I got angry because you know every microwave is different and how the hell would I know how to set hers...

897266,0,t1_ch4uvwf,You are in the middle of whatsounds alarmingly similar to things Ive experienced over the last  years. The description of your mother sounds so much like my DHs mother its a little frightening. I find it interesting to track my NMils subtle shifts in GC and Scapegoat placement. For some reason at some time during our NC years NMil shifted the weight of her worst burden from my DH on to me. I became the scapegoat then. Whats worse is she subscapegoated her sons and my child her own grandson whom she had not sen since he was  months old but did not scapegoat my DHs first child though he had been out of her life during those years as well. My own single rage with allof this is she became very wealthy when her second husband died then she hooked up with an even wealthier man while she lived in a board amp care with her second husband he had Alzheimers and other illnesses and needed  care. No a full week after her second husband the love of her life died she was buying a house with the guy from the Board amp Care while they traveled to Europe to buy antiques with which to furnish the new place. In all the years preceeding my Dhs attempt at reconciliation she never so much as sent our son a birthday or Christmas card let alone anything else. When we moved to a town mearby her new home she told us that she had set up college funds for use at either a reputible trade school or at University but not for Jr. College courses and had amassed K for DHs sisters son K for DHs sisters daughter neither had ever finished high school K for my DHs first son with whom he had been in touch until he mysteriously disappeared a few onths prior to all this and whom had inherited several million dollars cash plus much land and business equity and had all of K saved for our son.Had our kid been an infant at this time I would have understood a certain amount of money into the college fund each year the youngers are going to have less on the books. But no she and the second husband had begun this savings years back but did not include our son because and she said this out loud to my DH she did not know if he amp I were still otgether and as such did not want to do anything that might allow me to get my hands on a penny of her money if I had custody of our son and her DH amp I had been apart.So there sits all that dough. My son is in college had a . GPA last semester four classes and maintains a . GPA so far. He has been cited as one of the most talented naturally gifted students in his field of study and has atleast five very highlevel professionals in the field acting as mentors for him. He will go far in this careerbut hell struggle to get through the required BA he needs before he may sit for the Certification Boards. He could do some work without certification but that work pays just about minimum wage. Once he is certified he canmake six figures in a profession that is starving for talented certified people.All of this just makes me sick and I spend an inodinate amount of time keeping this out of my mindsince there is nothing I can do. My DH andI are both disabled fairly well broke but we WILL help him get through school no matter what. The biggest hurt in my son is not thathe has no money for college but is in the rejection by his grandmother. I do not for a second understand Narc and I guess I never will. If I could change a thing I would do whatever I could to just single me out as scapegoat and let her GC my DH and our son. Hell Id sign away any rights whatsoever to anything left to either of them including money if she would just show a tiny smidge of love the real kind to my DH and our son. Sorry I get a little carried away on this stuff too and feel guilty since my DH and son are now sufering because the NMil chose to move her chessmen around and make me into the Evil One. Ive even though if I left just disappeared from their lives my DH and kid might have some funds to live on but then realize thats crazy talk as she would just find another excuse most likely to scapegoat my DH again.Sigh. NCis the only option in our case but in so many ways it breaks my heart. Sorry for the Wall of Text reply. I guess Ive been bottling things up for a while. Thanks for reading if you got through this And hugs to all of you out there dealing with any Narc people in your lives.

916417,0,t3_24lpbw,I always knew that my dad was a heavy drinker but within the last ten years or so it has come out that my dad was is? into heavier stuff like coke and meth. When I lived in San Francisco for  years there was a three year period in which I would do MDMA about once a month. During that time I had also tried coke but didnt like it too much and really didnt get into it. I was NC with my dad the entire time I was up in SF save for two occasions. First occasion was my stepsisters wedding in which a woman there asked me if I was gay. I just laughed it off and told my brother after it happened. My dad overheard this conversation pulled my brother aside and asked home where this woman was so that he could kick her ass. My brother told him to back off and let it go. From what my brother said he stewed about this for some time and said something to the effect that since I dont have any honor that it was up to him to stand up for mine. He didnt come up to ask me about her probably because I would have let him know that he was acting like an asshole again and honestly I dont think that being mistaken for a gay man is any reason to rage... I just laughed it off and that was that.Second time was my brothers wedding and this was more in line with the subject. By this time I slowed down my consumption to the point in which I was probably drinking or doing MDMA about once a year as it just wasnt important to me anymore. Regardless I had opened up to my family about my experiences in San Francisco and had been honest about my drug use. My dad heard about it from someone and basically decided to walk around d the restaurant telling me about his experiences with coke and meth... I dont remember word for word the conversation but I remember telling him that my use was in the past and although I didnt have any really bad horror stories about the drugs  Im just not interested in partying like that any more. I also remember him telling me how much fun coke was and that meth really wasnt as bad as other people make it out to be. This struck me as odd as he must have known that meth did a pretty good job of destroying my moms side of the family ten years earlier but I remember the conversation getting to the point where I honestly thought that my dad was going to ask me if I could get him some drugs. It was really awkward.Again I have been NC with my dad for the better part of the last  years so a lot of what I hear about is second hand information from my brother who only just recently cut contact with him over the past year. I tried reestablishing contact with him right after my son was born but he burned through his three strikes within the first six months of my sons life. The last straw being that my wife son and I were supposed to visit him but he didnt return our calls that weekend. A few weeks go by with no contact and my brother calls me up and tells me that during that weekend my dad thought that quitting his job going to an Indian casino to gamble get high and not tell anyone including his wife and myself who had these plans set over a month in advance.... That was a better idea than seeing his grandson. That was just the final straw for me.

I asked her to buy healthier food she bought more junk. I got a job and bought my own food she would let my sisters eat it and raged at me for being selfish when I complained that it was mine and I had bought it with my money.When I finally did drop the weight she vacillated between proudly parading me before her friends like a zoo animal and then making snotty comments about how I hadnt lost that much or saying how sad it was that losing weight was the only achievement Ive had in my pathetic life.I think it boils down to jealousy that the spotlights on someone who isnt them.,raisedbynarcissists,chbpuom,2,t5_2we9n

He seems to say these mean things along with asking me twice throwaway...when you were little I wasnt mean to you was I? With me somehow saying no to justify his actions like they werent a big deal. The real problem is that he always has the upper hand he got back to his old self one time so I simply told him I would stop contacting him until he got his shit together well Im more dependent on him than the other way around so that didnt work out...All in all he has gotten better although I still suspect its a longcon since he is realizing he will become a lonely old man and wants to prevent that his Nfather didnt get many visits from his kids strangely. So when he uses the nicknames Im not sure whether to feel pity for him since his actions or lack of them in recent years seem to signify some regret. Ive been seeing a therapist thats helping me to focus on myself instead of him.

Good on you for finding a way to still do it safely.  I imagine that must help a little bit.My issue is mainly how hard I find it to establish friendships. I am so mistrusting of everyone and still have that voice in my ear saying You think they like you? Theyre laughing behind your back! No one likes you. Why would they? Whats so special about you? I get so anxious around new people  I guess thats why Ive always gravitated towards the people that actively sought friendships with me. I know logically I am not unlikeable. Since my son started school there have been so many school moms Ive met and connected with. I just find reasons to not let them in  my house is inferior to theirs they will judge it. Theyll think Im lazy if one thing is out of place and theyll gossip behind my back. I cant go out on the nights out with them because Ill wear the wrong thing say the wrong thing theyll realise how useless I am if they talk to me for too long etc etc etc. Its safer to save the money it would cost for a babysitter and stay home. Im my own worst enemy really. Thats the part that infuriates me the most  even though I cut her out shes still there in my head. I think my biggest issue is how safe I feel at home with just my son. Its my safe haven after feeling so completely unsafe when I lived with other people. The thought of inviting people in  even children my son wants to have over to play etc scares me.

968107,0,t3_256kvd,First I am sorry you are going through this during your pregnancy. I would strongly suggest you make a police report concerning the threatening message you received. They should have technology to record and save the message so that you dont have to worry about it being available when needed. You seriously need to ensure this is saved elsewhere than just your phone immediately. Just tell the cops you just want this on record in case anything happens.Next you and your spouse need to see a lawyer to draw up documents should anything happen to the two of you. While grandparents may not be able to force visitation but might still be allowed to claim the children to raise if the two of you die.I would also like to suggest you get a prepaid phone with a number your family does not have access to and use it temporarily. A week of peace can be really helpful in clearing your head and calming the mind. You can let your SO or a friend check your phone for important messages if you really think you need to do that but honestly a week isnt that long. I did this years ago and ended up choosing to change my phone number permanently at the end of the week.Good luck!,raisedbynarcissists,chec0po,21,t5_2we9n

I changed my cell phone number and told my Ns Id stopped using a cell phone. That way they could only contact me on my home phone so mentally I declared my cell phone safe.  If the cell rang there was no chance it was a dangerous call from an N only the home phone was dangerous..  I let the ansaphone pick up all calls to the home phone if its an N calling I decide when to call them back if at all.  It takes the heat out of the OMGitsthemringingIhavetoanswerwhatdoIsayIhatethis situation..  As for ending the call ifwhen its gets nasty I have two ways  both took time for me to feel comfortable with.  I either let a moment of silence hang then feign an upbeat demeanor and say Oh well been good talking to you talk again soon bye.  Or I just feign sudden disaster Oh sorry Ive got a pot boiling over!  Ill call you back in half an hour or so.For what its worth Ive been with my SO for more than  years and it took me a looooooooooooong time not to see him as the enemy every time I cried over my Ns. The cycle was  They hurt me I lay wounded he cleaned my wounds and begged me to stop getting hurt I screamed at him that noone loves me like my Ns and he shouldnt try to control me!  Its ridiculous but it was like that for a long time.Since then and in small measures Ive become more and more enlightened over the damage my Ns did to me and Ive come to trust my SOs opinion of them more and more.

996326,0,t3_25i5hf,I am a pastor.And yes its been difficult. My mother hasnt ever seen me in my craft I literally preach every Sunday and also am involved in preaching festivals throughout the year and its one of her favorite insults to go to I dont know how that congregation puts up with you. I bet none of them like you. My parents used to cut out articles and mail them to me about how stupid going to graduate school was and they couldnt understand seminary as a professional school. They wereare super against it. I get mocked for my career. Even though Im the only female senior pastor who started as a seminarian in my seminary of  people and achieved that at the age of . Academically and professionally its been a tough journey.  languages to master history and praxis a bachelors a  hour masters a congregation willing to call you my denomination is not exactly super woman friendly. I was in college the first time a church in my state called a woman as senior pastor and there are maybe a dozen now. Im very aware that if I mess up I close the door for women beyond just myself. I am always on call involved in some heavily emotional situations and always under moral scrutiny.The way my Nmom reacts is pretty painful. I was the SG seriously. . valedictorian who finished high school in  years and enrolled in college literally the day I turned  while also working IT at a private equity firm. I finally learned I could be an astronaut and my mother would complain about how much gas I used going to the moon.Im sometimes weird about women in my mother age range. Im still learning what healthy relationships with that particular gap look like. Intimacy is sometimes hard for me and as a pastor Im involved in plenty of intimate moments. Ive had parishioners ask me to stay in the room while doctors give them diagnosis Ive done funerals and weddings and very little gets into the family dynamics of others than shepherding them through those moments. Its still weird to be asked to do such things though a huge honor. it also sometimes puts me in situations where I have to mourn what I lost because I didnt even know I never had it.After doing this hugely crowded funeral yesterday for a man in my congregation I dearly loved his family trying to pay me extra like  times the church does I wont take their money while theyre mourning! I still find myself sweeping the fellowship hall with one other of my church grandmothers because thats definitely where I feel my role is like I should be cleaning a church not leading one. Its a FLEA. People pleasing is definitely an issue and sometimes an inability to stand up to aggression. But I do it well Im learning balance without burnout. And my church loves me and I love them. I was actually a supply preacher and they extended me the offer so I didnt even apply. In every sense they called me to their church and I am so grateful. It fits.

1005099,0,t3_1wnity,When I moved out of home to live with my dad during a divorce i was basically on the streets with dad and asked the RSPCA to take my pet rats.Nmom of course tells them she would take care of themHow ominous that was.So RSPCA do nothing I TOLD THEM what would happen. months later I finally go to get property back and I go to the cage and theyre all dead except one.He survived by cannibalizing the others I had hand raised him and he was completely feral. The cage had not been cleaned either.and Nmom claimed my year old sister was supposed to be taking care of them.and they didnt know how to take care of them and couldnt find any information despite having pet mice and rats and guinea pigs since i was  years old and they STILL had guinea pigs birds and mice! and the RSPCA BOUGHT IT. I cried for weeks not even exaggerating i couldnt get out of bed I cry when I even remember it by accident.  AND shes a Hindu.When I reported this to the RSPCA they blamed me and said theyre only ratsI called the police and they laughed over the phone at me then the officer called to her work mates and told them the reason for the call then they laughed too.Months later I find a phamplet for a program called DVconnect that has been in place for years and not the police or anyone told me about it.I havent been able to take care of animals properly since then.Borderline cant handle it.Do not trust your Nparent with your animals and do not trust the RSPCA to do anything either.I am sorry for your loss and I hope she gets better.And I hope your other pets are safe.,raisedbynarcissists,chijd34,1,t5_2we9n

1022607,0,t3_25t5kz,Well see for me theres a difference on keeping loving people in your life and not cutting them out and then there is keeping toxic people in your life and not cutting them out.Not wanting to be with people who hurt you is completely normal and healthy. It is my opinion actually that Ns make us doubt our instinct to leave toxic relationships because they need people to hurt. They need to feel power over others they need to be exalted. No one in their right mind would stay around someone like that! Its not healthy for EITHER PARTY!A child though who is already supposed to love and depend on their parent who has no choice but to look up to their parents is an easy easy target. There is nothing wrong with cutting toxic people out of your life. Honestly it will probably benefit the toxic person in the long run too. And imagine if your parents werent so sick. If they saw you getting hurt by someone like your nparents are hurting you they would not hesitate to support you in loving yourself and getting away from them.THERE IS NO GUILT OR SHAME in getting away from people who hurt you shamelessly and unrelenting. In fact you would be loving your parents and yourself by leaving. Love isnt subject to what we do love is a feeling. You can love someone and walk away from them just as you can love someone who has died. Love is your own love isnt subject to what your parents say they feel.Also it should be noted that what your parents say they feel doesnt mean it is what they feel. NParents are manipulative and will do anything to keep their false reality protected.You have unending support here. You are not alone you are not unlovable. You do NOT have to sacrifice yourself for anything or anyone of you do not want to.  ,raisedbynarcissists,chkiza5,6,t5_2we9n

How close you are to the branch locations and nofee ATMs can be an important factor. Some ATM fees when its not an ATM affiliated with your bank are  just to withdraw !Other than transaction fees another fee to look out for is the minimum balance fee. People choose the account type based on how much of a balance they expect to keep in the account.Example some people intend to build up savings and are sure theyll never get below . So they pick an account with a  minimum balance and avoid a monthly fee that might be a couple dollars a month.Some people need checking.

Their job is to help you they can talk to you about your rights get you a card and so on. If the account is not in your name but you have evidence that it is your money maybe still call the bank and talk to them about it see what they say. I am no where near qualified to tell you about the legal requirements on bank accounts and such. Also there is the whole consequences part of doing anything. Think through carefully first. If it is just your father trying to help you may very well upset him and cause a problem by just taking the money especially if you waste it after. I would first find out all the details such as whos name it is evidence of whos money it is and such. THEN talk to the bank. After I would have a good think about what you want to do run the conversation over in your head of what you will say to your dad what he will do. If it is yours.

If a spoon is left on the kitchen table they might say looks like the house was hit by a hurricane.Take a few steps back and just observe.  While you see humor in the new bike thing if you can try to objectively observe the behaviors they can be quite entertaining and sometimes pathetic.  Congratulations!  Youre now a parent of a  year old.  KIDDING!But maybe ask yourself how your therapist would observe and react to your father.  Most narcissists cannot look inward very far.  So when he says youre a loser!  You can respond youre saying I am a loser.  Whatever he sneers back just repeat it.  I completely understand.. Youre saying I....  Does he then back off?Or try parroting back what he says.  Im a loser.  But dont believe it of course.  This is just sensing out what buttons YOU can push that will get him off your back. Narcissists typically dont know what to do in response to echoed responses and will contradict themselves.  i.e. Stop saying that!  No child of MINE is a loser!  To which youd say I understand.

1129821,0,t3_271yvu,I have PTSD from sexual assault and rape. Also from a couple experiences I had in the military. This is in addition to the childhood PTSD stuff. I was locked in a closet by other kids for  hours when I was  and when I was in the Navy I was nearly shut in the baggage hold of an aircraft accidentally. I clawed my way through luggage and cargo injuring myself in the process and I kicked the door open as they were trying to latch it. Planes engines were running it was ready to taxi. Id have died horribly of depressurization. No one even apologized they just laughed it off. I was bleeding and had a sprained ankle and a dislocated knee. I was... upset. If someone say closes a closet door on me as a joke I am ready to hurt them... I become blindingly furious and have a huge adrenaline rush and have to lock myself down to remain outwardly semi calm.

I come to find out that my mother and father were taking these photos to Walmart printing them out and then physically sending them to cousins aunts and uncles and great grandparents.  The crappy grainy ones.  And they were sending these pictures to people that had not had any contact with me really ever.  Now if THEY had taken the photos that would be one thing. They would be photos of their visit with their grandkids.  But those were MY photographs my parents werent even around.  And they were going to people I didnt know.  Grainy and crappy.  I said I didnt like this at all.  It also made it difficult for me to interact with my grandparents.  Id send them a photo and theyd say Oh I dont need this.  Your mother already sent me one.

If your parents taught you that you arent allowed to have boundaries this may have taught you that you arent allowed to say NO because NO is a very basic boundary.  When I was younger I used to be a target for these people too.  I think in my case this was because I was desperate for validation and good attention.  These people smelled it on me and would swoop in.  It was exhausting.  But I grew into a person that these people almost never approach.  I have no qualms about shutting these people down right away and they seem to recognize this in my posture or whatever so I am not often messed with.

As such the man who works with me sees my mother at family events on a regular basis.  She routinely makes a point to talk to this man and tell him that she loves me but that I just lie all the time  thereby attempting to implant the idea that any discussion about why Im not around her is a lie.Ironically this man has an nmom too  and by our discussions he is starting to come out from under her manipulations at a much younger age than I was.My nmom goes around our small town to anyone that we still have a mutual relationship with which is fewer and fewer people to say things like this.

Second going NC puts you in a better place emotionally  and as the parent of your children if youre in a better place you can do a better job of raising your children. Even if you want to put your childrens needs above your own the best way to do that is to meet the easier needs.

1225008,0,t3_284n1a,I totally relate to your post.  HUGE relating feels over here.  I just started a new job about a month ago.  With my professional eyes I can see that my resume and skills exactly dovetail with the new position and its perfectly aligned with a step up from what Ive been doing but I have the foundation to do the new job.With my DONM eyes I am dooooomed!  DOOMED!At least once every day my eyes glaze over and I think Self what the hell were you thinking?  This is insane!  And I let my eyes glaze over a bit for about thirty seconds.  Then I pick up a new piece of paper and start digging in again.You Dotdotbludot have the perfect situation to start working on your anxiety.  Your boss believes in you.  Youre not in fear for your job or your life like my childhood was.  You have a safety net that can help sustain you through these tough moments at work.  I promise that you dont have to feel confident to do a good job.  As you get things done and get more comfortable in your job your confidence will grow.  Heres how I cope  When I notice that Im freaking out I stop what Im doing.  I take a deep breath.  I let out the deep breath.  I remember that were all just little teensy creatures on a big rock hurtling through space and that none of this business stuff will matter a bit if theres a natural disaster or big dinosaurs start stomping through my building.  I think about the people and pets that I love.  I pick the one thing Im going to work on next.  I move everything else out of the way.  Then I gather myself up and start working on that thing.Being a newb is hard because you have to admit that you dont know things and you have to ask lots of questions.  Narcissists will make you feel like a jerk for even asking a question so this is naturally a tough thing for folks like us.  Remember this  how someone responds to a question tells you more about THEM than it does about YOU.  If someone is nice and kind and answers thats a normal response.  If theyre a jerk and treat you badly you just learned a lot about them and you can use that information for the next time.  Treat it like an experiment.  Lets see how Subject A responds to normal stimuli.  Remember  Youre the one with the clipboard.One thing Ive done in the past is written a list of projects that are on my plate and handed it to my boss.  Sorry but I cant figure out which one to work on.  Ive listed the deadlines but I need you to prioritize these for me so I know Im working on the right things.  This helps me immensely.  Do you have something like a touchstone that you could keep at your desk?  I once worked with a woman who loved the color purple and she was helping me with a stressful project so I knitted her a tiny square of purple angora.  She used it as a stress reliever and stroked the soft yarn whenever she was overloaded.  Are you a fan of a tv show or celebrity or someone you think is awesome?  Put up a picture of them and use that connection to build your confidence when youre stressed.Make sure you take breaks and get up and move around a little bit in between work chunks.  Its amazing how easily I forget that I have a body when Im working in databases and using my brain at a zillion percent capacity.  Your body needs to move around at least a little bit every hour.  Even if you just get up and go use the restroom its a physical reminder  You exist.  Your body functions.  You are not your job just a good performer of your job.Eat awesome food that you love.  If you have a treat that you like reward yourself with it.  Make goals within your day and have treats lined up.  If I finish X goal I get a cookie!  If you have friends that you can have lunch with in the middle of your day sometimes make those plans and keep them.  Youre a human being and you deserve a lunch break and time with other human beings.I honestly feel like you and I are in the exact same place right now.  My boss recently admitted to me that this is the worst possible time to bring someone new on and theres no way for me to do this job effectively while learning it.  Hearing that really helped me acknowledge that these are superhuman feats we are trying to do and doing them even adequately without trying for awesomeness is a great achievement.  Your feeling that its healthy for you to be challenged is spot on.  Its not easy but this is how we come out of our shells and find strength we didnt know we had.You can pm me any time.  I am right there with you.  And Im an overachieving scapegoat daughter of an NMOM.  Coincidence?  I think not!  I grew up where a B is the end of the world and an A is not worth praising unless she was bragging to her friends and that never happened when I was around.  Ye gods.  Lets give ourselves a break and allow ourselves to be humans first and good workers second.,raisedbynarcissists,ci7fjsi,2,t5_2we9n

1300646,0,t3_28x6ax,no dont do it. I had a roommate that wanted the phone in my name because she had some neighbors who ruined her with the phone company. That should have been a sign. So after living with her for a year or so the phone bill is now late all the time because shes not paying her share. Not only that they wanted a  deposit to turn long distance back on using it ran up the bill. She was meeting guys online and spending all night in deep conversations all over the world and offered  if I gave the other . I told her I was good with it not on since I never used it. People like that are full of shit giving out ridiculous promises to turn it all around this time if only youll help them out. Bullshit. Every time someone helps them out they are enabling that behavior and there is nothing to stop them doing it again. So heres what theyre going to do get payments caught up immediately with empty promises to pay it back and never use it again which will be immediately forgotten the next time they want to go shopping instead of saving money. Youre looking at subsidizing them while you live there and when you leave theyll be dependent on that free money. Which by then youll still be giving them thats how it works. Look really hard at stuff they are buying and bringing home. How much of it is junk they dont need. Thats their attitude towards your credit card. You need to cut it up and put a hold on another one being sent out until this is over. ,raisedbynarcissists,cifxttr,2,t5_2we9n

It sounds like youve been through hell it sounds like youve been isolated for years.  Im so sorry.Im glad to hear youre really considering the hospital I truly believe it will be a very positive thing for you.  Uhm if you live in Texas then I can tell you lots of things about how to get to a hospital!  But you probably dont.  What you want to do is you want to talk to a local crisis hotline that is in your community that knows the details of your local mental health system.  What Im hoping is that your community has some sort of mobile crisis outreach team because thats a service that can actually go to you and give you a ride.  Another option honestly is to ask a police officer for a ride  if youre voluntarily and cooperatively going with them they might not treat it as an automatic involuntary commitment then again they might.  But again even if they do its not the horror story youve been told about.  Id start by either calling  United Way or NAMI www.nami.org  click the Find Local Support button and then call your local group.  Either of these would be able to tell you who the local government funded mental health agency is in your community and should be able to provide you with their crisis line.  And if you call the local crisis line they will know about transportation options in your community.  Calling a suicide crisis hotline could also work its just that the person you are talking to might not be local and might not be connected to the local mental health outreach team or other options that might exist.  ,raisedbynarcissists,cihxux0,2,t5_2we9n

I have no idea how to go about getting the forms to the doctor without relying on them for transportation since thats pretty much how theyve designed it if I need to go somewhere I need someone to drive me and I have one friend I have no one else I can ask to drive me outside of my family. Im not sure how to sort this out because Ive been so isolated for so long that I dont really know how to make it happen. Im not really angry Im just really disappointed that it came to this. Ive not been prepared to be an adult really not that I cant because I know I can but that they stop me and sabotage me at every turn. One of their favorite insults is that I need to stop being such a child. Ive mentioned applying for a job they said I should just get on disability instead I told them Im not disabled and that Im more than capable of being a good employee and a productive member of society. They changed the topic. Im still harboring a lot of resentment for them filling me full of psychoactive drugs I didnt need and essentially not having any teen years I got my GED at  and started community college the same year because I had to be on homebound and wouldnt get enough credits to graduate because I couldnt do gym or any electives at home. Essentially I went to middle school part of my freshman year of high school switched to homebound instruction where you stay home and teachers come to your house and eventually managed to get my GED early and go to community college. I have my Associates degree and Im finishing up a certificate this fall that will be totally worthless looking for a job but its not like I had anything better to do anyway and after that I have no idea what will happen. Theyve said that they wouldnt cosign for an apartment if I moved out and I have no credit and no way to save any money. Ive been trying begging pleading to get my license since I was . Ive tried talking to people who I thought might be able to help but mostly people just looked at me like I sprouted another head. My parents are wellrespected in the community my mother is a teacher who has been nominated for teacher of the year several times and all of her students love her. In this town Im not my own person Im my mothers daughter or my fathers daughter or my sisters little sister. I guess people dont understand that people can present two different faces and that even my siblings never saw the side of her that I see on a regular basis. In two years Im going to be out of here and I am going nc with nmom and lc with everyone else. This is pretty much the only hope Im clinging to right now. I dont think in this town where dreams go to die that I will ever be able to fully extricate myself from them. If I dont get out of this town soon I know Ill die here just like everyone does.

AHAHA no.It hurts to be excluded by family who is clinging to the old roles. They will probably never get it. Like you I saw on Facebook a gettogether I wasnt invited to actually titled No Drama Christmas. Since Id gone NC the month before it was clear who that was directed at. It hurt. But I had to ask myself would attending have been better? I wasnt missing out on some fairytale family holiday.

Youre right though unless you get very good at establishing and holding boundaries the best you can do to protect yourself is to go NC or ULC ultra low contact.If you ever do decide to reestablish contact you have to tell her that the past is off limits and if she tries to bring it up or refight any old battles that youre going to cease contact again. And when she inevitably does you need to smile at her and get up and leave. Dont blow up or get visibly upset with her at all because she will use that against you as if YOU were the problem and not her.,raisedbynarcissists,cizwapz,2,t5_2we9n
1465247,0,t3_2ay8w7,This is all very familiar. I dont think my mother has any actual disorders but she lived with my abusive father possible ASPD not NPD? for yeeeeeears and so I think was changed or caught FLEAS. Still a bit uneducated on this. I will offer my thoughts and hope that they help you in any way gt She doesnt cry she gets super logical and Im being very reasonable about this and just want an apology  which really is what anyone would be entitled to if I responded that way. Its times like this that I worry that Im just on a hair trigger of anger toward my mother.No this is a thing. I wouldnt say that youre always on a hair trigger. Sometimes people react sensibly when they are actually being mistreated however infrequently or lightly yet act completely ridiculous when they are perceiving threats to their self that are not actually being made. My father actually did things like this a lot. He would behave so insanely and basically push push push and create situations and when I finally blew up over something small he would suddenly become the most reasonable person ever and quietly say You know all I said was  and you  and pout. It was infuriating. Im not implying your mother is doing anything on purpose but perhaps she learned this behavior and doesnt realize she is doing it. gt What really kills me though is that she raised me to value my independence but now complains that she wishes I would rely on her more.Your story of your dog was frustrating and confusing. I would feel as you did. However again in my experience the quote above applies to a lot of parents. My mother too. I was asked to get a job at sixteen had to work for extra money for school clothes and supplies I was given  for both every August no more and made my own breakfast and lunch most years. Now Im out of the house and am consistently being infantilized whenever I casually ask for advice on things like cooking or other domestic attributes lol. LET ME COME OVER AND I WILL DO IT FOR YOU! Im thinking Funny when I was eleven you would put dirty dishes in my bed if I didnt wash them. I think a lot of parents do this. Shes hopefully proud youre so independent but also regretting that her making you this way means youre distant now. Thats how I view my situation. My mother will be very supportive at times when I dont need it but other times completely dismiss me and tell me I am crazy. She will stay on the phone with me while I want to cook something but when I told her my doctor diagnosed me with a hormonal issue that affects pretty much every part of my life she told me I should try to heal it naturally and doctors just want my money and I need to stop reading things on the internet and stop being a fucking nut. There is no logic to when where or how she supports me because she is used to situations that never really worked off logic years spent with abusive dad. gt I will also add that she gets uncomfortably hyperaffectionateThis used to make me very angry as well because I took it as a dismissal of the abuse I experienced at her hands. I thought she was purposely trying to make me forget things and that she was downplaying what I feel to be very important and traumatizing experiences. Now I am not so sure. Whats important to note here is that my mother was a victim of domestic violence and abuse for a very long time at the hands of my father so her behaviors toward me were not wholly independent from her experience with him. Even though she got away from him and he wasnt in the house with us anymore she was still changed. I guess she still had fleas right? She still does this to random you know I love you stuff a lot. Im beginning to realize that shes apologizing for my experiences with dadher insanity without actually offering an apology. gt And I dont know where her faults end and mine begin anymore.What helped me with this is understanding that things I said or did were my responsibility and things SHE said or did were hers. This only happened after I stopped being angry with her for being a victim. Things were at their worst with her when I felt like my devastation was her fault because she allowed my dad to treat her this way. Not proud of this but I was a teenager So even if she said or did something completely irritating I would try to respond in a way that would make me feel like I was not encouraging my own faults. This helped me separate things in my head and helped me understand that my faults are ultimately my responsibility to work on. gt Maybe she isnt being that bad and I am just looking for reasons to be irritated. I dont think I am. But I worry.To be honest it could be both. Sometimes at the same time. Or one day its one thing and another day its the other thing. This happens and its normal and its expected. Selfreflection aka what you are doing with this post and pausing to consider reactions and what youre going to say go a long way in my experience. There are days I am aggravated and I know Im being too impatient with my mother. There are other days where shes clearly had a bad day and acting like a nutjob. Perfection is impossible and when you have two people who are dealing with their own crap there is always a time when neither of them can set that crap aside to deal with each others crap.

If so their perception of what could have gone on in your family is going to be way more forgiving simply because they have no frame of reference.  But chances are they have a hint that something is very wrong.  This is what Ive noticed with my extended family whom Ive recently been in touch with a lot more.  How about something like this?Dear e aunt and E uncleThank you so much for your concern.  I really appreciate that you guys are looking out for me.  It means more to me than you will ever know.  As my mother has been largely unsupportive of me lately its good to know that someone out there is concerned for my interests.Theres something that you need to understand though.  My mother has been treating me abusively for so many years.  This is not a simple kiss and make up situation.  I have cut contact with her to protect myself.Forgiveness is Im afraid not really going to be enough.  My mother needs to do extensive work on herself.  Therapy would probably be helpful for her.  She needs to stop her abusive and hurtful behavior and Ive learned that she simply cannot.  For myself I am already in therapy trying to heal from her abuse and cannot keep going back to a relationship in which I keep getting hurt.  Id like to encourage you to step back from making her issues the focus of our relationship.  If you want to be helpful please encourage her to seek professional help for her issues.

1524501,0,t1_cj728z9,Its a combination of being hardwired that way and being raised in a home of severe abuse and neglect. The ratio of the two varies from person to person. I dont believe that abuse and neglect can cause an otherwise normal person to be antisocial and sadistic my experience has been that there has to be some predisposition although some other care providers disagree. I have never encountered a person with this pathology who did not experience abuse and neglect in childhood but it does sometimes occur that an individual had a normal upbringing but developed this pathology regardless. I cant name any off of the top of my head but there have been a few serial killers who had normal childhoods. Most sadistic sociopaths are like the OPs mom. They arent rapists or serial killers they abuse spouses children and anyone else within reach. Serial rapists and serial killers get a lot of attention but are rare extraordinarily rare in the case of serial killers the FBI estimates that there are  active serial killers in the US at any given time and although some have disputed how they came to this conclusion lets just go with it and say that  serial killers in a population of  million means that sadistic psychopaths in general fit into the general population and reserve their abuse for those around them. Its quite insidious. Having been a foster care caseworker I saw this pathology ALL the time and it is heartbreaking how long it goes undetected by those around the victim. Sadly emotional abuse is often enough to satisfy your average sadistic sociopath. That is sad because it is often hard to detect by people around the sadist they know how to keep up appearances and it is tricky in terms of social services whose confined budgets mean that they barely have enough funding to rescue the kids experiencing physical abuse and neglect. The OPs home environment would get the attention of social services but mine would not.I do want to note that I am not talking about sadism in the fetishbdsm sense consensual sadism as a paraphilia.  that is entirely different. I am talking about people who are physically andor emotionally abusive or are causing physical violence against others rape assault homicide.,raisedbynarcissists,cj7dfwf,3,t5_2we9n

If its someone I trust like Fiance I tell him I know youre upset right now and I know its not about me but Im really anxious because I know youre frustrated. And then he tells me its not my fault I dont have to be upset etc. And then I go off to be alone for a while with my coloring books and Disney music. If its new people I cant read yet or people I dont particularly trust I just go off to the bathroom or wherever for a minute to take a breather. Its tough but you gotta do what you gotta do.,raisedbynarcissists,cj8l08d,1,t5_2we9n

1535925,0,t3_2bk9vk,My poor brother was constantly mocked for his college choices. He ended up with a PHD in Social Psychology and is pretty damn successful. He did it without any support from our parents and while working. They still say he needs to get a real job amd that he didnt study real science just some made up bullshit. Now he is a successful entertainment director for a large convention in California and an adjunct professor in his spare time. This of course means that he needs two jobs to survive because of his junk degrees. No parents it means he found purpose from his teachers and wants to give back to other kids and help them in the same way. Idiots,raisedbynarcissists,cj8sy9i,2,t5_2we9n

1543408,0,t3_2bwgdo,Believe me you are not alone. This mirrors my own experiences as well as many others. I had developmental issues too.  And my mom never let me forget it. In fact when it was time for college my parents couldnt afford college so they used my issue which was not a big issue at that point to tell people that was why I couldnt go. Luckily my condition was really mild and I used her constant berating as motivation for how I would make it. You know what? It is sweet to make it but youll never get the moment when shell be shocked. Shell probably just deny that she ever said that youd never be able to make much of yourself. But I think you should write it all down just for your own sanity. So youll always know what youre up against every day.  And you know what? Youll be able to look back on it and with real evidence be able to point to the things you cant remember anymore. You can sympathize with all the junk and realize that even though youre young youre not wrong. Its funny because thae people have the unique gift of winding you up into their game and then telling you that you had all the control for one reason or another even though you were the innocent kid. I understand how youd want to take their financial assistance and use it against them to make it.  But be careful because you are getting close to the emotional rent. Youll get to go to college sure. They choose what you study. Even though they dont understand you or have your real best interest at heart. To be honest even though having student loans can suck they are at least not nearly as crippling as the u.s.  Yeah it could be rough. I am not telling you to take my advice and not take their help absolutely. You know your own capabilities. If you do qualify for asperger  you might get some financial assistance. But because you are only  you have the advantage of time to look though your options. You might have more possibilities than you think. And I hope that you also find a trusted advisor who can help you through the college application process who understands your parents may try to manipulate you throughout. If youre good well sign it. If youre bad better luck next time. Oh its due tomorrow?  Sorry poor kid! These people get their jollies off of your innocence. They know how easy it is to manipulate you but you got some things up your sleeves. They wont win this fight. And when you get to the u.s. Whole ocean between ya.

My younger sister taught herself to cook while at university and recently moved back home.  Nmother decided my sister was in charge of cooking for everyone but got really bewildered and pissed off because the stuff my sister taught herself to cook are things my sister likes and not things my Nmother who has a very limited boring palate likes.The only thing Nmother told us about tampons was that she was too scared to try them herself because it didnt seem nice to have them up there.  We knew the mechanics of sex but never got spoken to about consent or what to do if we were uncomfortable in a situation with a man or if someone were touching us in a way that made us uncomfortable.The impression I got of sex was that it was something put up with for the sake of the man and to have babies  rather puritanical stuff considering I was being raised by two atheists in the nineties and noughties.Nmother did teach me how to hoover mop and dust.  Unfortunately even though Id do it exactly how she showed me it was somehow never good enough and Id get insulted for it.  So I stopped doing these things and Nmother would play martyr because now she was the only one who does anything.I would complain to Nmother about her never washing my clothes in time or giving them to my siblings everyone received each others clothes  even my Nmothers whose clothes were several sizes bigger than anyone elses.  So Nmother would tell me to wash my own which I would agree to.  Then it would turn out that she needed to use the washing machine every single time I needed to that it was wrong for me to take her wet washing out so I could use it.  She would even bagsy the washing machine or dryer by filling it with clothes for her to wash or dry later and then throw a fit when Id take them out as they were so I could use the machine.,raisedbynarcissists,cj9vlhv,1,t5_2we9n

I played soccer when I was ...he may have come to one of those games. I had been involved in several other things up until that point and he never made an effort. I was in marching band throughout high school and he only showed up to the last game. NMom went to the games for a while then bitched about how uncomfortable it was and how much she hated it and totally dropped out of that aspect of my life. Its very rare my dad uses the phone. When he does its to call for help.I feel very little emotional connection to him. In many ways Im more upset with him than I am with NMom.

You dont have to necessarily bring them over to your side just tell them the parents shenanigans and that they might try to manipulate them. If you can get to them before your N parent youll stand a better chance at keeping them when the N parent decides to gossipmanipulatemake you feel alone by turning everyone against you. If theyre warned in advance they may be manipulated theyll expect it and identify it better.Theyre probably going to write you out of the will and cut off any child benefits you may be receiving through their insurance. Im not sure how obvious this one is but thought I should mention it anyway. If you live in the States figure out your longterm healthcare.If they have any access to your accounts or anything financial cut them off before going NC. There are a lot of stories in here of N parents using their kids funds andor opening credit cards in their name ruining their credit. Protect yourself financially as there could be a lot of trouble for you in the future if you dont.When I cut off my mother she also cancelled a primary email address I had on her ISP account.

Everything that happened. They arent there to judge you to remark in a you should have handled it better tone. You will cry. You will probably struggle not to cry. Thats okay too. Its alright to cry in front of them they get discounts on Kleenex so you might as well use up that box in the corner. Dont push yourself. Relax. It will be fine. Breathe. Center yourself. Youve made it this far havent you? Dont give up. Its going to be wonderfully scary good. Expect to discover yourself. Expect changes to happen. Revelations will ebb and flow within you.

How does that work? Is it an application or are there dues? My own father is about to be broke and homeless within the year has failing health and pretty much everyone in his life has burned all bridges involving him and I certainly do not have the means nor desire to support him or take him in unstable behavior has had police called on him by family numerous times alcoholic.Im pretty sure the coming years will see his first major health issues crop up and the beginning of the end but hes never worked an honest job never paid into health care or social security taxes never served or held onto any assets.

It might be stupid  stupid advice. Personally I am terrified of doing or saying anything that will make my parents stop my study. That fear in addition to the desire to stay as far as possible I applied in a distant and horrible college and completely screwed my career up. What I want to say is while you take preventive measures make sure that your fear doesnt affect any major decisions . Dont let that fear control your life. Trust me you dont want it. If the root is possibility of your studies being stopped maybe you should have some back ups planned? Like little money saved for emergencies or possibility of part time jobs or you father supporting you. If you just have some options you will feel a little more confident in retaining your abuse.

1760566,0,t1_ck0vnxc,Totally. Im actually emailing with someone I suspect is an N and trying different things out on them to see what reactions they give.So far one telltale sign has been that he sees the world as being unfair to him and him being this good guy in a horrible world that has never given him any credit first flag actually. This I realised is also reflected in his original desire to find a friend that really understands him and wont leave or get bored.Another one is that he wants a lot of detail about me right away even though he claims to want to move slowly into friendships.But one that keeps coming up is no matter what I ask his answers are broad and completely nonspecific. Im actually having a field day with this one asking him all sorts of questions about himself and giving him noncommittal answers of my own. Its one thing to be notsospecific online but another to have no depth to anything you say at all. Like he has NO personal stories of any kind. Nothing. No matter what I ask about his background his work nothing gets any sort of actual concrete detail but so many words that in the end say nothing at all. I really want to see what happens with this one.I am using my online dating anonymous account for all of this so he doesnt actually have access to my personal stuff.

1814742,0,t3_2f9wk1,Ive read the three posts involving this story and I want to respond to your question about how to be there for your boyfriend.  As someone whos been on both sides of the grief monster  having it and watching someone have it this is what I have found to be most effective.  First I might say that my typical response to grief and difficulty is similar to your boyfriends and if he wants you in the room while hes thinking and you are able to let him process without interrupting him as hes requested then you have already won  of the battle.  As a silent processor two things are important.  dont start worrying about me more than I am worrying about myself. Keep happy within yourself and maintain your belief in my ability to be strong and happy.  Dont pretend that my grief isnt real. I think most people gloss over difficulties and try to distract the sad person because they themselves are uncomfortable with sadness or difficulties. If you are both willing to let the other person be sad and you are both willing to believe in the other persons happiness then this can be a tremendous bonding experience. Because lets face it you have both suffered huge losses. ,raisedbynarcissists,ck7uwf6,3,t5_2we9n

He usually just stayed out of it when mom would rip me a new one but then comfort me afterwords. When she got really bad he would defend me a bit and dosay something to get her rage refocused on him. Im an only child but my mom treats him like a second child a lot of the time. Im not really sure why hes stayed with her  years!! but Im very grateful he did. Hes probably the most mentally healthy person I know  her shit just rolls right off him until she goes too far with me. And then somehow someway he gets her to quit for awhile. I guess the difference though is that my dad is like  so thats super intimidating compared to my moms . Plus shes never had a job and is physically incapable of working now so shes financially dependent on him so maybe thats why she reigns in when he pulls rank on her. Sometimes the best way of protecting kids is by keeping the family together. Maybe your mom thought a split up family would be worse than dealing with a tyrannical father? And just from what Im getting from your post your dad sounds like the type of dad to manipulate you guys and her and the court into custody with him especially if he thought he could have your mom committed. Living with him without your mom there to counteract what she could would be hell. I know it would be in my situation without my dad. To be honest Id probably have a slew of mental problems or have killed myself if it was just my mom and no one else there to tell me they loved me and that I was fine the way I was.

Stupid story I can tell the whole thing if someone wants me to.Another time I got really fed up with Nparents complaining that I never did anything around the house while at the same time leaving a bunch of junk in this old entertainment center in the dining room. So I cleaned that mofo out and threw away every single mids leftover piece of crap in the sucker. Dusty cables blank VHS tapes owners manuals for equipment we never had. Gone. I sweated and screamed and threw things into the trash can and when they came back from wherever they were when I was doing all this they seemed kind of...intimidated and impressed at the same time.

He knows my background realizes its difficult for me to do and that it can go off the rails quickly but its gotten easier over time to then stand up for myself for larger issues.  Initially Mr Rabbit and I would have discussions over IM so I would feel more comfortable talking about certain subjects and so he wouldnt have to be front row to me trying to sort out various feelings and the odd looks on my face that would result due to them. ,raisedbynarcissists,ckjgacl,6,t5_2we9n

I also didnt realize I was emotionally abused growing up until I was . It was like all the abuse hit me at once when I realized that the mindset I was raised to have was hurting the way I lived my life. Sometimes I wish I could go back to when I didnt realize it was wrong because of the anxiety I have about making things better. But Im glad I know now that how my NDad behaved is wrong so I can make sure not to accidentally treat others the way he treated me and I can work on standing up for myself.,raisedbynarcissists,ckjgw1i,9,t5_2we9n

CPS doesnt have to prove the foster parents have done anything wrong in order to remove a foster child from their care and theres no need for a court to be involved.  The court already gave CPS custody of the child and its up to CPS to decide what living situation is best for the child and to decide when a change in living situation would be in the childs best interests.  This child has not been attending school or getting any formal homeonline schooling and has ended up in the hospital with selfsliced wrists  these are very concrete facts supporting the urgent need for a change in living situation.,raisedbynarcissists,cklfz51,23,t5_2we9n

1933333,0,t3_2gsj13,Boy is that topic a can of worms. And its certainly one I am paying attention to since I am now pregnant woohoo!!.I just googled Can a child be disciplined without being spanked and came up with thisFrom the antispankingMany parents settle on a discipline method just because its how they were raised  and never give it another thought.Interestingly adults who were not spanked as children dont spank their kids.kids who are spanked who have a harder time regulating their emotions and who get into more trouble. A  study by Elizabeth Gershoff and her team cited below reviewed the previous two decades of research and confirmed that children who are spanked are more likely to exhibit depression anxiety drug use and aggression as they get older. Children who have suffered more severe corporal punishment have been shown to have less gray matter in their frontal cortex and to have amygdalas that are more hypervigilant.From the prospankingFear is essential to respect. Children wont do what we tell them to do unless  at some level  they fear the consequences that will come from not doing it. Punishment isnt a bad word. Its a life lesson. My wife and I disagree about spanking. She thinks you should never use violence to discipline a child. But the result of that is my kids sometimes torment mommy to test their boundaries. They want to see just what they can get away with and how far they can push before she cracks and loses her cool. Its excruciating to watch.Now here is what I found interestingMost information against spanking came from docs scientific studies and parents who were raised never in a house where they were never hit. Or those from an abusive household that saw what it does and knows that their parents were wrong. The prospanking came mostly from parenting mags and parents who were raised in a house with hitting andor spanking. I couldnt find anything with doctors or research backing it but I didnt search very long. On the pro side there was also huge debate on when it should stop. Some say its only okay for  others say all the way into the late teens. So. Who is right?Personally I think spanking should not be used in place of reasoning. Its right up there with saying I told you so.  The bottom line is how does this teach our children. What does this teach our children?I was hit growing up. I may be okay and well off now but that was due to counseling self reflection and changing myself. I was not set up for success by my parents. They hit me when I misbehaved but even then I dont know what I did wrong most of the time or why. Honestly I think it was to shut me up or a way for them to get their anger out. Or both. Can I definitely say its wrong or not? No. But this is also why I am going to be attending child psychology and parenting courses. The way I was raised was wrong. Also if I can find a way to rear my child without hitting them in any way shape or form including spanking I will. I think many people just use it because its convenient and what my parents did. Or they are convinced it is the only thing that works. Funny though I heard that a lot watching Super Nanny and she was able to figure out a way. She also stated that in her decades of being a nanny she has never spanked a child. She must be doing something right. ,raisedbynarcissists,ckm5ipk,3,t5_2we9n

If a person doesnt adjust their behavior to what you communicate they are not trying to help they are trying to make themselves feel like they are a helpful person.The latter behavior meets their needs whether or not they meet yours. So your mother can comfortably ignore and forget what you say because what really matters is her satisfaction in her own behavior.Also you have the right to object to how youre treated no matter what someones intentions are.

Another friend moved his girlfriend across the country where they knew no one got jobs cats apartment and established a life then when friends from home visited he had an affair with the female friend split both couples to be with affair girl and dropped girlfriend  at a mental health facility and shipped her things to her family. This was all while telling me and everyone that would listen that hed found a love that none of us could understand because it was so much higher and better than any wed ever experienced. He walked around like he was high on gods best weed silly grin on his face all day spouting wisdom and again reminding us that wed never love like that.

I hadnt even looked at it this way before I usually just focus on the fact that Im a huge weenie who freaks out at a park because there are too many people and I will figuratively die in five minutes if I dont run away. But yeah I do stick up for my folks whether theyre my SOSIL my family or my friends. I knocked a dude over once when I was  because he wouldnt leave my best friend alone creepily. I felt ashamed of myself afterwards but bff assures me  years later that it was completely awesome and that she loves me for it.TW AbuserI had a boyfriend once who straightup admitted to beating his ex girlfriendmother of his children multiple times. She is someone I was friendly with. After thoroughly giving him the business about being horrible I may have said some less than ladylike things about his continued status as person should it happen again. It never did and he never touched me afterwards without asking ever. To be fair he didnt last much longer as boyfriend material. I hope that wasnt too violent for posting and I certainly DO NOT CONDONE confronting known abusers by oneself if at all. I was very angry and did a dumb thing and it turned out Not Bad but it could have been very different.And youre right. Youre totally right. SO and SIL dont know what its like to have a normal healthy parent and they have been squashed under the rule of NMIL for so long that they dont have the means to fight back against her tyranny. Yet.Im... feeling kind of empowered now. Is that what it feels like? Its a little scary. But I think I could learn to like it. I promise not to Oberyn Martell it all up and ride in for vengeance only to fail.

My family acknowledges it and makes it out like its a big joke as a way to cope with my mothers narcissistic tendencies and abuses. That scene with the wire hangers? Yeah my mom found a wire hanger once in my closet and threw it at me. Didnt quite beat me with it like that scene but definitely still hit me with it. It became a running gag for the family. All her antics were really.My EStepdad used to love reminding me of that scene where she forces her daughter Christina to reclean the bathroom after she has an emotional meltdown and even though it was already cleaned. Scrub Christina SCRUB! was what she yelled at her.

Scrub DeepEyes SCRUB! he would yell in the background and laugh.She does it all.

2143836,0,t3_2jio4b,I just decided to go NC and I already feel stronger. I started immediately to feel hints of my old interests things that made me happy. The N became so strong with my parents that I forgot what happy childhood memories I might have had. I have a vague awareness in the back of my mind of my mom scratching my back before I fell asleep and my dad playing with us when we were between two and four years old. The only warm feeling I remember is being in a onesie on someones lap at my grandparents and drinking a bottle. That is my one happy childhood moment and I remember I still had long hair so I was about three. My mom started chopping it off when I was around four even though I cried every time that I looked like a little boy and would walk around with a coat on my head for days. Letting go of the fantasy took years for me. The first time someone ever asked me Did you ever think that there might be nothing wrong with you? was a therapist I had in undergrad. I was around nineteen. Im thirty now and going NC for me is the final letting go of that fantasy. Now I get to grieve a childhood I never had and all the failures they set me up for. I had tried to do it in the past but wasnt able to until I saw them for what they really were and decided I could not should not have such toxic abusive people in my world any longer. With my mom its NC. With my dad Its VLC. I talk to him with a business tone mostly via email and he actually responds better to me this way because Im no longer expecting any sort of emotional response from him. I really really wanted that. My therapist says that there will always be a little child inside that really really wants that fantasy. I went back and forth a lot. I probably still will just not as much. My dad got angry with me because I told him I really need him to man up and not give in to so many of my nMoms crazy requests such as that he never help me at all in any way and completely abandon me... which was always her dream because she wanted his unconditional love all to herself. He held it over my head when I needed something from him he made sure me and my three siblings are fully tied to him with financial strings so theres the constant threat that Ill lose everything and have to live on the streets. That is the fear he controls everyone with. I said sorry to him for telling him I needed him to man up. He said it was a nasty thing to say. But then I remembered that when I was seeing a psychiatrist on my own that I got by participating in a research program so he had no control over the types of doctors and therapists I saw they had been drugging me and sending me to therapists who bought what they sold since I was nine and fully convinced me that I was crazy ... sorry... trailing off... anyway the doctor really helped me start to say no to them and to build my own reality and believe it because what he saw in me was a lovely person who was remarkably still capable of unconditional love and empathy. My dad was so angry that I wasnt being numbed out and brainwashed anymore but was actually getting to the root of my problems that he said I was probably sexually manipulating my doctor. Hows that for a nasty comment? Never got an apology for that one. And hes the GOOD parent my mom is the worst. I say try NC out. You can always go back if youre not ready. Try it again and again and see how it makes you feel and talk to a professional about it while you do it or talk to us about it. I got choked up too. I cried. After I cried I felt better. ,raisedbynarcissists,clcbvs6,4,t5_2we9n
2146994,0,t3_2jl0wy,The first step is to view objectively what your outburst may look like to future friends and people you deeply care about. In males short violent outbursts that arent directed at other people tend to end up with either broken fists or holes in their drywall. There are multiple ways to work against parasites like anger without radically changing your home life.   . Exercise. I recommend noncardio exercise perhaps something like kickboxing if weightlifting is not effective. With this youll become better at defending yourself against anyone not saying you need to beef up to deck your father youll be physically healthy and youll be able to work through pentup energy.     . Most schools have counselors. There is a reasonable possibility that theyre hopeless and will ignore certain requests like dont tell soandso x y z. If you have reason to suspect they will fit some worstpossible scenario then take the lead when you meet with them. There is nothing selfish embarrassing or shameful about saying I want your help to work on myself before I make an important decision in my life. This could shake up my home life but my time and health is more important than... it comes first. Will you help me?    You deserve to make choices like an adult. One of your options is to improve your life by contacting outside help and moving to a safer and better homelife without him. Another option is to contact a relative you trust and ask if you can join their household for a while. If you need to leave your current school behind you then remember that it is not the end of the world. Who knows how long itll be till he gets your mind to think I deserved it. The past wont change but people worth trusting wont poison your mind by denying what happened.    Recognize that some of these choices may be considered extreme. Empower yourself with the FACT that you deserve the opportunity to change your life as radically as you need to in order to keep going at all after... what happened. All the luck in the world wont help you if you avoid the lottery. You are not a crash test dummy so why sit in your fathers car?    You will end up making a choice.

I have an allergy to gluten celiac disease so every time I ate it in the past I would get a histamine response followed by an adrenaline rush. Anxiety central!Seeing as I had my own ruminating thoughts I know they can be extremely stressful. It might help you to consider anything and everything that can help. Schema therapy I find is great for people coming from an abusive home. Acupuncture can help with anxiety and depression. Meditation can help and being mindful of the fearful thoughts that consume you when it happens. This is only anxiety and it is not based in reality just in the conditioning my parents have taught me.I used to worry big time that I was doing something to upset other people at basically all times and the only thing that calmed me down was spending time away from people that causes me to be that way in the first place. Eventually I began to tell myself that I shouldnt worry about upsetting others if what I was doing was meant with positive intentions or I would have no way of knowing whether or not I could be doing harm. I think in general this makes us much more sensitive and thoughtful of the needs of others but if were always worrying about people other than ourselves its hard to meet our own. Try to think about what makes you happy to do and what you are sure wont harm other people and do that when you feel anxious.

2199883,0,t3_2k9syd,I think the key is to never ever talk about money.  If I look at the point in your story where things start to go wrong its basically where you tell her you could use the money.Ns use money as a way to wield power.  I know it makes total  sense when you are financially struggling to reach out for help.  Normal nonN parents want to help when their kids are financially distressed.  Ns are basically the equivalent of predation animals that follow wounded prey animals until they keel over from fatigue and then they eat them.Heres my classic example  I was really really hurting for money in grad school.  My mother and father asked what I wanted for my birthday and I said tuition money I was living on loans.  You know what I got?  A Burberry trenchcoat  which cost about  in the s.  That would be  of loans I wouldnt have needed.  And WTF am I going to do with a fancy trenchcoat as a grad student who is looking under car floormats for coffee money?It sucks to not be able to be vulnerable and honest around Nparents.  And it was really hard to learn to be vulnerable to anyone because of that.  And again if your mother was a normal parent these gifts would have no strings.  But she isnt normal and unfortunately that means that to be safe you would need to not share money issues with her.,raisedbynarcissists,cljgjn6,3,t5_2we9n

2224248,0,t3_2kl9qy,Social behavior has to be learned as does regulation of ones emotions and unfortunately its only loosely connected to intelligence. Smart people can also have huge blind spots when it comes to social interaction. Being intelligent does not automagically make you skilled at things and this includes being skilled in social situations. There are people that absolutely have both but not as many as those that dont have both. For example theres a ton of good engineers out there but only a fraction of those can also effectively manage a tech company or department. Another example of this would be a great surgeon with a horrible bedside manner which is not exactly unheard of.As far as spirituality goes in your mother it strikes me as probably a sign of desperation. The world doesnt work how she expects it to and spirituality is her attempt to fix that situation and deflect blame off herself while it hasnt been fixed yet.

Weve become much closer over the years as I sought therapy and worked through some of my anger. Even though I know that kids who are abused often copy the abuse the guilt is still a big thing I have to deal with. Even worse is the fact that I still resent him sometimes for being the favorite and then I have to deal with the guilt from that. Its something Ive barely even touched in therapy because Im so afraid of that part of myself. Im so afraid to discuss it with my brother for fear that hed hate me and I know hed be completely justified for it. Despite all the jealousy I still love that little dork to pieces when my fleas arent controlling me. I cant bear the thought of him hating me.I dont think youre doing anything wrong. However being on the other side of the situation I hope my experience can help you realize that he might be very aware of what hes done to you but it could be very hard for him to deal with it or acknowledge it. Essentially dont hold your breath waiting for a tearful apology. I know his denial must be very painful for you.

2309483,0,t3_2lpb8k,Hey man Im also a medical student and  and I have this kind of conversation with my parents too. Honestly my parents have some narcissistic tendencies since were Asian but Im on mostly okay terms with them. The relationship youre having isnt healthy because your parents arent seeing you as an adult but still as a child. I set firm boundaries with my parents. If they want to talk to me I ask them to text me if Im free. If I dont respond then they usually leave me alone. If I do then I can talk. But I told them that Im busy and if they want me to talk to them at all then they ought to respect that I have higher priorities than listening to them prattle on about whatever. And on the comparisons thing my parents used to do that too until I started doing it back to them. I would compare them to the parents of my friends and then ask them how it made them feel. Eventually I said things like that enough to where they stopped. Medicines already enough of a competition as it is. I certainly didnt need them piling it on as well.Good luck with your parents.

2317493,0,t3_2ltr30,I struggle with insomnia and I probably always will. I have to say though since going through therapy and realizing that I am not responsible or in control of what my n family does I feel a lot less anxiety. My mom was also a huge problem for me because shes very anxious and would set me off. So just working through the idea that theyre the toxic ones not me has helped me tremendously. It took time though it takes a while for your brain to piece together all this new information. In the meantime do all the things that your therapist recommends so that when your body is ready to rest you have good habits in place. I try to have some relaxing time before sleep go to bed at the same time every day sometimes I do a bit of night time yoga think about things I am thankful for and I sometimes rely on melatonin or sleeping pills. Exercise also helps tremendously.. get out for a long walk a couple of hours before bedtime. And most importantly dont beat yourself up when you dont get sleep.. be very kind to yourself and try to focus on every night as a new opportunity. That might sound a bit hippie but I found that when my sleep was at my worst I was counting hours and trying to make up for things and getting all worked up feeling like I was in a continual deficit.

2343401,0,t3_2m5uur, Just leave it method Take all of your negative feelings and imagine them as if they were a ball or other object in your hands. Then just leave it on a shelf. Throw it in the trash even. You dont need those feelings and they dont have to exist inside of you. Just set them down somewhere and forget about it. Reflect method This actually comes from a comment I saw on a post here yesterday When your nparent is spouting nasty things at you try and think the reverse of what theyre saying about yourself. Youre a terrible child  Youre actually an amazing person etc. I imagine it takes practice. When an evil person calls you a horrible person it must mean youre actually a great person because then otherwise it wouldnt upset their narrative so much right? The villain always thinks the hero is the villain. Pep talks method Give yourself pep talks in the mirror. This is something I used to do before job interviews but now do every so often when I get down. Just look yourself in the eye and verbally list off all the traits and qualities about yourself that you like about yourself. Congratulate yourself on them. Really push that ego out into the spotlight and shower it with affection. Its healthy to have a modest ego an ego helps you like yourself which is important for continued happiness and success. Maintenance method If youre hungry eat. If youre tired sleep. This is more advice for college than it is for emotional support but it can help both. When I was in college I found that I functioned better if I got up for a snack when my stomach rumbled mid cram session it helped keep my eyes from sliding off the page. And Id fall asleep on my textbooks a lot but it helped me focus the next time I looked at it. College is rough and has a lot of information they expect you to cram into your brain but if you ignore bodily needs in favour of extended study sessions youll only worsen your information retention and it wouldnt be any better for you than if youd taken that nap.Best of luck!!,raisedbynarcissists,cm1cu6s,3,t5_2we9n

Young children who are still attached to their parents feed the N supply because they are in many ways not a separate person yet. Its easy to influence them tell them what to think and do and to see them as a minime. At  or so this changes. Kids go through the natural development of being a separate person with separate feelings ideas thoughts and opinions.

2366130,0,t1_cm3uz8m,Hey thank you for sharing. It does help to know there are others who are in a similar situation because one of the traits of an Nsibling is that they tend to make you feel guilty and full of self doubt when you stand up for yourself. Growing up with that makes it REALLY easy to blame yourself for everything  because lord knows thats who they are going to blame. For me the most difficult part to navigate is her relationship with my mom and how my Edad will believe anything she says at all. He loves me and is very proud of me and impressed by my selfreliance and strength but instead of connecting that to the household I grew up in and the necessity of me learning those traits because of the overshadowing of the Nsib it turns into an expectation that I never have problems and that I dont react to my Nsibs bullshit which hes in denial about anyway even if he can sort of see my perspective from time to time its meaningless and temporary. Just wondering how old you and your Nsib are? Me and my sister lived apart for a long time which actually made our relationship stronger. Also because I have issues with my mom and she stresses me out weve bonded over that from time to time which Im realizing may be actually toxic because Nsib doesnt see that she has the same traits as Nmom.,raisedbynarcissists,cm45vdb,1,t5_2we9n

2374332,0,t3_2mj9a7,God reading all of the posts in this sub continuously reaffirm the fact that my mother is a N. I had to get a restraining order against my mother when I was a teenager because she would show up at my school unannounced all the fucking time. She lost custody of me when I was  thank god but would stalk me at school where my father nor grandmother could protect me. My schools were unaware of the fact that she was not my legal guardian so she would just waltz into the main office saying she was my mother and ask for all my school records and grades. Sometimes she would take me out of class just to visit me. She was crafty as fuck so sometimes on the class summons slips theyd just write urgent matter report to main office instead of your mom is waiting for you so that Id actually come down expecting my dad or something. It got a lot better after I turned  except one instance when I went to the ER. I have no idea how but she found out and thankfully they couldnt release my medical records to her so she couldnt find out why. That didnt stop her from her harrassing me to tell her because she deserved an answer as my mother. Anyways just wanted to say that this stalking behavior is very very characteristic of Ns. Youre not alone as Im sure other commenters have stated. Im considering giving my mother a new restraining order by coercing her into giving me her home address you need one to serve them. She wouldnt tell me where she lived and no one seems to know. This doesnt stop her from sending me letters with PO boxes as a return address however. This means Ill have to break NC and pretend I want to reconcile and visit her. Shell eat it up. Also wanted to comment on the public violation aspect asking you to come to Thanksgiving and to hug her in front of your coworkers is incredibly manipulative. You have to understand how abusive this behavior is and a violation of your boundaries. Do NOT feel guilty please. When my mom came to my high school graduationthe restraining order was still in effectshe walked up to me and my friends all sweet and innocent like Give your mom a kiss and gave me a card  balloons. These happened to be not very close friends so they were enchanted with my mother as she comes off quite charming at first. My friends couldnt understand why I was fuming and refused to hugkiss her. They literally looked at me like I was a bratty teenager who couldnt appreciate her loving mother.

I still remember the times when we sang together and that he took me for walks to show me the constellations and talk about stuff. And then I remember that it all ended when I started being my own person and disagreeing with him and the fact that he would argue to crush the opponent his  year old daughter rather than come to some agreement and accept that someone else could have a different opinion than him.

2381553,0,t3_2ml0qd,Your friend Isaac is amazing!  I have an Isaac in my life.  Im  now but my parents mainly my mom my dad just hung out on the sidelines and never really did anything.  My mom however would put on a front and seem like the cool mom who smokes weed and makes dick jokes.  So when I would tell my good friend Lindsay about all the awful things my mom did she has been my friend since I was  shes more like a sister now she believed me but probably thought I was being a teenager and exaggerating.  Then when I was  I was kicked out of the house because I wouldnt tell my mom why I was crying.Lindsay came and picked me up she had been  hours in a different state and dropped everything to get me.  My parents were FURIOUS at Lindsay and her family who has pretty much adopted me at this point.  They started making phone calls and threatening the parents.  They sent me a letter saying how I was at fault for the divorce and my father who occasionally hit me saying I deserved it.  Lindsay fought back she told my parents to fuck off.  Im now living with Lindsay and her husband in a city I love with a boyfriend that treats me so well and understands about my past and is very patient with me a lifetime of being bullied leaves you a little fucked up.  Sorry this was a bit of a rant but all Im saying is it will get better.  I Dont know where you are at now OP if this is recent or an old story but Isaac loves you and his mom loves you.  Never forget that and never feel bad for asking things of them.  They understand where you are coming from and they LOVE you unconditionally.

Well theres many theories out there that are plausible. One is that Ns are stuck at the emotional development age of  years old its all me me me me I I I. Another is that these people have very low self esteem but unlike normal people a Narcs caveat is that they wont admit it. Theyre immature in that they refuse to acknowledge their own flaws or mistakes. So inead ofworking on themselves the hole remains and they desperately try to fill it. This is where their controlling behavior and inflicting pain comes in. It makes them feel big in control good about themselves like they mean something. But in the end none of it matters.

Ive had those terrible moments of realizsation as well.I only have another opinion about this part here you said The only way to get that love we so desperately need is to find that perfect match andor have children of our own. I dont agree I think this can have elements of repeating the cycle because you will then be dependant on your spouse  children. Instead I think that learning to be your own parent is the key. Healthy people are healthy because they learned to be their own parents from their actual parents. People with unhealthy childhoods might either make their spouse  child their replacement parent or learn to be their own parent themselves imho the healthy choice  which will be quite difficult but its possible.

2410957,0,t3_2n292c,EDIT formatting pFirst congrats on graduating!gtI have joint bank accounts I need help figuring out how amp when to close.I cant speak with  confidence about joint bank accounts but I believe you can close them in person without the other person present. This may depend on the bankcredit union. Your safest bet however is to first open a new account preferably with another bankcredit union and start putting your money there.The reason for this is because it is a joint account both account holders have full rights so if you joint account holder somehow got wind of you movingclosing the account they could do it first themselves and receive the funds. Unfortunately this is the trust pitfall of joint accounts.gtI want to move far away and get a job after I move because Im afraid no one will want to hire me from out of state. But I also have a lease I dont know how to break. I dont want to do subleasing I dont want to be responsible for some stranger in my place.The lease is something you should discuss with the landlord because it totally varies. If you tell them you are moving due to graduationjob they could allow you to break the lease with nominal fees. However this is up to them and they have the right to charge you rent on the remaining months on the lease. Whatever you do make sure you get what they say in writing because that written lease contract trumps whatever verbal deals they make.gtI dont know if I need a new drivers license or how to get one because I dont live in the state my old one is in.EDIT Once you move you typically have about  days to update your license. Youll need to go to the DMV with your current license and proof of residency in the current state. Make sure to notify your insurance company of your new address.gtI dont know if I need to get new health insurance or not because I dont know if its under my parents and its from a different state.How old are you? If you have health insurance under your parents as a student chances are you could remain on that plan until you graduate and thensome after. Thats provided your parents dont raise hell before and drop you. Health coverage is definitely something to consider when looking at jobs.gtI want to have my own accountant. My Nparents use the same one. How do I find one for myself?Unless you have very complicated finances chances are you dont need an accountant. Do you have retirementschool savingsinvestment accounts? If you do or are still very concerned rpersonalfinance can provide better advice and options for you especially as you plan to relocate.gtI know Im probably forgetting things. What did you all do after graduation to be independent?On another note about finances it may be very wise to start monitoring your accounts and continue to do so after you move out. Once a year you can check your report for free at www.annualcreditreport.com. If youve never done so check it now and see if there is anything under your name that shouldnt be. You may also consider putting a credit alert on those accounts.Grab SSN cards birth certificates vaccination cards if you can. Good luck!,raisedbynarcissists,cm9pbrd,3,t5_2we9n

Since my dad was already at the track I called my mom who was on her way if she could grab my socks. She did. Awesome! Now my method of relaxing for a race was to rock out to heavy metal and be by myself. Both my parents know this. My father abides by it. My mom not so much. So shes harassing me for pictures and I say Mom please not right now. Im trying to get ready and focus. Well theres one thing my mom hates more than meat and thats not getting what she wants when she wants it. She gets pissed. I brought you your goddamn socks and this is all the respect I get? Im your mother! I gave birth to you! If it werent for me you wouldnt be here to make my life miserable! Thanks mom now youre making a scene.

2418837,0,t3_2n5r5z,My husband struggles. He will act defensive of the mother that abused him and his  halfsister. She was overtly abusing his halfsister. She even burned her with cigarettes. She covertly abused him. She made him her best and only friend but shed also have episodes where shed scream and throw things or worse. Any how she did a lot of horrible stuff and still does. He knows that but he cannot stop himself playing her defender because she really cultivated the persona of being weak and needing his help with everything and shes married to an N as well so Nfil is more concerned with himself and never gave her the attention she expects from her son. Theres an element of covert incest to it as well so there are just layers and layers of abuse here but because she didnt often strike him or beat him he has a hard time putting the word abuse to it. Edit I think my husband actually has an easier time accepting that his father is abusive because it is overt.

All gifts from Ns are trojan horses.The question is What do you ask for Christmas or your birthday from your Ns?

She never wants to do anything or go anywhere. My eDad works long hours all week usually weekends too. nMom works a solid  as a receptionist. The house has gone to shit and the only household responsibility she hasnt yet shrugged off is grocery shopping and she neglects this so much that often there is no food in the house.

Im the SG in the family.  last night my wife was saying how when she first met my parents she was telling them some cool stuff I was doing.  shortly into the conversation she was shocked that the NPs just sat there in complete indifference.  it doesnt matter what I do in my own life until Im in their lives playing the role they want me to play.  only until then will they lower the drawbridge to their kingdom welcome me in to bask at their throne and maybe give a hoot as to what Im up to.  this doesnt bother me its been this way for decades.  its only now that I can wrap the whole experience up under one NP umbrella and feel bad for them.my mom has a series of stories collected from my childhood of all the times I was being bad.  I try to correct her she wont listen.  having and telling those stories is more important to her than to listen to me.  she needs to know Im a bad person.  whenever we send gifts she LOVES to tell my wife how great they are.  especially when my name is on the FROM label or when I do pick the gifts.  my GC brother has no such problems.  the only story I can think of now that she tells about the GC is when he was  and tore the wallpaper off his bedroom wall because he missed my ndad who was always traveling.  now the GC has two kids and is always traveling.  the circle of N life continues...thanks for sharing that helped me vent a few nuggets of frustration.  edit  have a Happy Wedding and a bright future without the NPs!,raisedbynarcissists,cmd6bsc,4,t5_2we9n

2449802,0,t3_2ninow,Ugh even thinking about diaries is a trigger for me.  Im so so sorry you were violated like that.  I know how it feels.  I tried to see a therapist after my grandparents were killed in a car accident then a month later I was molested by a family member.  My mom sat in the room the entire time and made it one of my worst memories that didnt involve physical abuse.  As she was ushering me out of the room he suggested I try to keep a diary.I got one and wrote in it.  My sister who is  years older than me found it and made fun of me to all her friends who then told anyone they wanted to about what Id written in my diary.  So I decided to start putting fake entries into that and I got a new one.  In the end I was laying false trails around my entire room because of how much snooping my family did.  I think I had  hidden diaries all with codes to them.Then I went off to college and ended up in an abusive relationship.  Walked in on him reading my diary.  That diary was one of my first purchases after signing the lease for my own apartment.  I thought itd be safe from prying eyes in my own home.Now my fiance is trying to help me with some mental scar tissue and I really love writing but I just cant bring myself to simply write about my life in a book.  Its as if I dont trust the journal!If you decide to confront your family about it I wish you the best of luck.  Stay safe because as many have already told you this is beyond not normal.  This is pretty unhinged.  So be careful and take care of yourself   Keep your chin up,raisedbynarcissists,cmehzcq,2,t5_2we9n

Oohhhhh.... oh god.... yup... thats me.... god dammit. Holidays are of course very.... difficult with nmom. Fortunately I am currently spending Thanksgiving with my partners family which is delightful. I went to give nmom a call but that quickly turned into a  minute guilt trip rant. Apparently she also completely forgot about the plans we made for my partner and I to come for xmas so now he is not welcome and me bringing this up ruined her whole day. She only wants me all to herself and I am the selfish one for asking if my feelings matter. Its funny how she can say how awful I have made her feel but its usually ME in tears by the end of the conversation.  Anyway.  Thank god for this place.  I really appreciate you all!

2450828,0,t3_2nkz9n,This is really alarming. Your mother is showing that she does not care what you say or do  she is even saying explicitly that she will never give up even if you make yourself perfectly clear. Its disgusting. I tend to follow the Gift of Fear school of thought that you cannot straight talk a twisted person and so you need to erect your boundaries while not giving them any positive feedback. And positive feedback in the twisted persons point of view includes telling them off or telling them to stop. You have to keep blocking her every single time while not engaging her on any level. And eventually if she is not getting feedback of any kind she will stop.Edit And I really think that messaging her back with any response that implies you laughed or found what she said funny even though a normal person knows its because youre angry will be taken as positive feedback. Anything with lol in it will just imply to her that what shes doing isnt actually a big deal though of course thats a twisted way of looking at it as well as any like anger on your part because shell tell herself you just need to cool down and then youll agree with her. Any response at all to her is going to get twisted around to serve as positive feedback and thats not going to get you what you want.,raisedbynarcissists,cmemjcb,12,t5_2we9n

2456923,0,t3_2nodni,Its a disturbing moment to be sure when it suddenly clicks that these people are YOU.I know personally pretty much my entire life my assumptions about myself and the world were based on a foundation that my parents loved me wanted the best for me were selfless people who had my best interests at heart. There were a lot of things that didnt make sense on that foundation but I explained those as my own failings my own inability to grasp their plan to simply do as they asked to be who they wanted and intended me to be. My own fault for making it hard for myself.Even though I was thoroughly disillusioned with my parents I had never challenged that base assumption until I came here. Then I did... and two things happened First everything I had built on that assumption that foundation abruptly collapsed under its own weight and all of those things that never made any sense suddenly did. I was surrounded by both clarity and wreckage.I think its normal to be angry at that point to feel robbed. We spend all our lives trying to make work something inherently unworkable.

Its nothing to really complain about to those that dont understand because its not like shes late and it just looks like she wants to spend more time together.  But her earliness is unpredictable and capricious.  Sometimes its five minutes sometimes its two hours.  One memorable time she arrived at  am when we had plans for .

Its not your fault you are not crazy and you are not being cruelheartlesswhatever nonsense they will claim you are purely because you wont cater to them.You wouldnt feel guilty for removing a cancer from you body would you? These toxic people in your life are a living breathing cancer. It may start out small and something you dont really notice...but suddenly you look up and its overwhelmed you.Both my wife and I are children of nparents our mothersI was able to be civil with my mother divorced from my dad who only stayed with her because of me and my sister at family gatherings because I am not there for her I am there for everyone else. I treat her like an old coworker that you never really talked to. Just the casual Hello nice to see you politeness and move on. Reminding yourself how little they matter in the grand scheme of your life is important. They dont control your life you do.My wife on the other hand cant have any contact with her family at all except an aunt and uncle on her deceased fathers side her father died when she was young and was not an Nparent because they are so vile.I would suggest going low contact with them perhaps only lettersemailphone. That way you can simply hang up or delete the message if it becomes too much for you. If you emotionally cannot handle that much interaction with you meaning if theyve hurt you too badly I never mean to imply that you are weak then no contact might be the better way to go.The most important thing to remember is that they will not see what youre doing as right. They will blame you for it it wont matter to them that you are doing it for yourself. They will only care that it is a bother to them. Be prepared for that no matter your decision. It is not about you it is never about you. My nmum started screaming at a potted plant when I wasnt in the room to yell at. They dont care if it makes no sense they only want to get their negative energy.Work with your partner and make a list of rules for your family. And make sure you and your partner hold each other accountable. Such as  strikes no contact for a few months etc. They will not insult you or no contact etc. They will either learn that they have to play nice in order to get any interaction from you or they will not make the effort and therefore you have saved yourself a lot of time.,raisedbynarcissists,cmkbfep,1,t5_2we9n

I wish I had bookmarked it so I could submit to rbestof.Anyway here it isI like the stepping on your foot analogy for situations like this. Theres someone in your life who every time you meet them comes up to you and stomps on your foot. Sometimes they say sorry sometimes they say it was an accident sometimes they say they saw a bug on your foot and were trying to help you sometimes they deny that they stomped on your foot sometimes they say it was your fault because you moved your foot under theirs sometimes they stomp more sometimes they stomp less.They might even say that they wont stomp on your foot again...but at the end of the day every time you see them they stomp on your foot.After a while your foot gets really sore and you get used to the new way your foot feels. One day you start to realize that no matter what theyre going to stomp on your foot. So you stop being around them and your foot slowly starts to feel better. You stop reflexively moving your foot away from people so that they cant stomp on it.And then some family member comes by and tells you that foot stomping is the way they show that they love you that they stomp on everyones foot how sorry the foot stomper is for stomping on your foot how they dont stomp as hard as they used to. Dont you see how hard it is for them that you cant be around like you used to.It doesnt matter every time you see the foot stomper they stomp on your foot. Maybe they do it lightly at first but your foot is still sensitive from all those years of being stomped on... and if you stay around the stomps get heavier anyway.At the end of the day you dont want your foot to get stomped on. Youve given them many chances to stop stomping on your foot and they dont stop. If theyve said sorry for it it doesnt matter because they keep stomping on your foot.Maybe someone else has tougher feet and can handle a bit of stomping. But youre tired of getting your foot stomped on and youre not going to be around the stomper anymore.,raisedbynarcissists,cmo6z02,74,t5_2we9n

Because you are pregnant were attacked and are still making contact with your attacker and wish to continue to do so and it is triggering for many of us who went through these types of situations as children. Many here are seeing what you are doing as putting yourself and your own wants and desires before your child and we all dealt with that in our own lives.Many here watched their parents and grandparents get physical with each other talk shit to us behind each others backs used us as weapons against each other turned us against our own family members turned family members against us and everything else you could think of and you are using language and reasoning in this post and previous posts that can be viewed as similar to what our parents said and did regardless if it is or not.The biggest factor is in that a great number of us were children when these things took place. No one protected us instead they told us not to be selfish because we didnt know how hard it was for them.

Thats not even accounting for the premise of you begrudgingly taking on a difficult and involved career option youre not interested in.I had some emergency surgery a while ago and after she started asking about it I specifically didnt mention it to her I told my nmom about a fundraiser I was doing to raise money for it.  My Italian in laws insisted on doing it thats the sort of communal attitude they have.  Who would have thought family actually wants to help each other?!  She demanded to know every detail of the surgery bills records of my communication with the billing department  etc. in an excruciatingly detailed and timely fashion or she wouldnt help me with the bills at all.  She went off on me saying she doesnt have enough money to help me bringing herself to tears over the phone saying I was being disrespectful.

She was the only person who did this and she was the last person I gave the information to.I simply told her she doesnt have to help me if she doesnt want to.

2615570,0,t3_2psmvb,This type of behavior is normal considering the childhood most of us were brought up in it is the traumatic effects of the abuse. If we CoNs shared anything about ourselves the Ns used it against us somehowsomeway. Therefore many of us as ACoN learned to keep ourselves guarded. It appears from your post your NM believed you were an extension of herself your body was her body and etc. It appears as you grew older and moved apart from her you decided to reclaim yourself by withholding what you consider yours from others. Correct me if I am wrong and forgive me if I offend. I am simply trying to help you understand the situation. If this  is not helpful I apologize.   gt Does anyone else experience this? My Nparents hated the fact I never truly told them anything. I used to when I was younger but I quickly learned I was only shooting myself in the foot. I never gave them anything useful to use against me later which drove them mad. They tried everything in the N book manipulationguiltreverse psychologyshamethreatsphysical amp emotional abuse none of it really worked. Finally my Nparents accused me of being secretive and having something to hide. They smeared my character to others and made it seem I was a devious person not to be trusted simply because I kept my shit to myself most of the time. When I got older I found the words to say I have nothing to hide but I also have nothing to share. I still have this mentality. I share what I believe pertains to the conversation at hand. During other conversations if I trust the people I am with I add my opinions and other insights.  gt And how do I get to a healthy level of sharing information with people?Well this is tricky. There is a saying Be careful who you open up to some people actually care while others want something to talk about. I would suggest taking a good hard look at the people in your life. What is their track record? According to your post it appears your SO has a pretty decent one. He appears to respect your privacy and your boundaries IMO he appears to be trustworthy to share information with. Are there others in your life who also appear to have a decent trustworthy track record? Others who respect your privacyboundaries although you never truly set them explicitly?  As for a healthy level of sharing only you can gauge what that is. Allow me to elaborate my SO believes sharing facts about the birth of our child with other mothers is a healthy level of sharing. I on the other hand do not.  The best suggestion I can provide is to talk to a mental health professional they have the knowledge skills and experience to provide you toolsinsightsskills to get you to a level where you feel comfortable being. Many charge on a sliding scale and are affordable. A clinician I know has been practicing for over yrs and charges as low as hr.  I hope this helps. ,raisedbynarcissists,cmzzrjv,8,t5_2we9n

Is there someone at school who you would feel safe reaching out to? A counselor or teacher you feel comfortable with? I would advise you to document ANY abuse you are subjected to. This includes taking pictures of marks or bruises left by physical abuse and recording verbal abuse when you can. I looked it up Alabama is a one part consent state meaning you can record the conversation without telling anyone as long as YOU are part of the conversation. Anything you cant document directly keep record of in a journal with dates and as much detail as you can remember. Hide this journal if you have a bookcase or lots of books I would advise taking one of the paper sleeves off of a hardback you have and wrapping that around your journal to disguise it in plain sight.

Im really fed up right now and to think I will have to somehow faked happy family tomorrow night it already makes me feel sick note  I cant fake so Im sure shell go cant you stop being moody?! its xmas night!! urgh...Heres what happened  I asked my brother GC bullied me when I was younger what he wanted for xmas and he said he wanted some foamboard sheets because hed like to make a model of the house hes going to build. Well at least that was a clear simple request right? There no art tools stores where he lives but there are in my city so I went there today found the oversized foamboard and all is well! or so I thought...I phoned my mum tonight and told her I had found the foamboard heres the conversation Ive found the foamboard! I took  sheets the lady said that was enough for a house model but if needed Ill go take some more she was extremely nice!Oh you found it! How much was it? because...value  price right? sigh...It wasnt expensive about  for  sheetsand what else did you buy?well nothing... he just wanted the foamboardNcrisis incoming shes shouting there and what could he do with just  sheets of paper?! he needs a cutter and glue!! Do you call that a gift?!!!Seriously I was speechless a second there. Just what.the.hell. I had to look all over town to get my brother EXACTLY what he wanted. And Im getting yelled at. He never asked for the whole equipment to make a house model just the thing he couldnt find anywhere dammit!!I lost it afterwards and I too raised my voice I said he didnt ask for other things. That was just too much for me. Next what? she will shout at me because I didnt buy a protective sheet to carry the foamboard?! She always ALWAYS find something to point out how much Im stupid for not thinking about obvious things like that... it irritates me to no end you cant imagine. I can say nothing because she will always say have you thought of that? did you buy that? how come you never think of that?!So now my happy mood is ruined Im not looking forward to tomorrow night because Im sure she will talk again and again about what happened... well at least this year I have you all at RBN now every time I must listen to her nonsenseguilt trip gibberish all I think about is oh I have to remember that to tell everyone on RBN Hugs to you all! ,raisedbynarcissists,cn3jmpr,2,t5_2we9n

Being in high school I got home an hour earlier than my other sisters. I got off the bus and I could hear the screaming all the way out to the road minimum m. Everyone else on the bus could hear it too  friends that knew how crazy my Nmom was yelled Be careful! and Call us if you need to escape!! as the bus pulled away. I swallowed and walked up the driveway.I got in the front door and my smallest sister was standing in the foyer staring through the dining room into the kitchen. The screaming was deafening at this point  it was my Nmom screaming hoarsely at my EDad. All I could make out was Ill fucking kill you. I scooped up Sister and ran towards the other end of the house. I asked he what she had been doing and she said My movie finished.. I turned on a new movie for her grabbed the phone and walked back towards the fighting afraid of what Id see.I saw my dad straddling my moms chest hold her wrists down beside her head on the floor. There was a large gash on his cheek and he was bleeding onto her shirt. In on of her hands was a large in. blade butchers knife which she was trying to cut him with. Let me UP! she screamed over and over kicking her heels trying to find purchase. Not until you put down the knife and calm down EDad yelled back. Over and over the same exchange no resolution reached.I stood paralyzed in the doorway unsure who to call. Should I dial ? My mom was obviously trying to actually kill my dad. Should I call child protective services? Obviously this was not something a  year old should have seen. Should I call another family member? Maybe they would know how to make this stop.In the end I called noone. My Nmoms father showed up unexpectedly after over an hour and a half of fighting and they just .... stopped. EDad went into their bathroom to clean himself up and NMom told her father we were just fighting dont worry about it. They never spoke to me about it happening about whether I should have called or shouldnt have called anyone nothing.Whenever I need to impress on someone that my childhood wasnt normal this is my goto memory.

When he left that went with him.My edad turned into an ndad afterwards though. But his type of narcissism was not apparent when they were married. He is emotionally absent and did not get his gratification from his children.he got it from other women So his narcissism only reared its head if he was called to point in his father role. Thats when we were ungratefull selfish kids only concerned with our own needs etc. fx. asking him to come to graduation or some other engagement would send him into fits. Anything that would hold him to some kind of responsibility as a father would set him off Before the divorce I never had any confrontation with that side of him.So my theory is some eparents are actually narcissists but its hidden under the umbrella of a more actively enaged nparent and they are comfortable in their enabler role.  When they divorce other aspects of their pathology comes to light because it isnt outshined by another nperson and thats when you realise that both are batshit crazy.,raisedbynarcissists,cn7yhln,8,t5_2we9n

2689437,0,t3_2queq8,I have good news legally your scumbag parents just fucked themselves right into the criminal courts.  They were trespassing at the very least which is a serious crime.  If they took anything at all AT ALL or vandalized your property in any way whatsoever that bumps it up to felony burglary.In every state entering an unlocked door without permission is trespassing.  In some states its considered a Home Invasion.  Your door being unlocked doesnt mean youre inviting anyone to enter.Google the phrase entering an unlocked door trespassing? and read the results.  The following is from a criminal lawyer A person commits criminal trespass by entering someone elses property without the owners permission. Unlike burglary trespass does not always involve the intent to commit a felony although in some states trespass is committed by going onto another persons property intending to engage in unlawful behavior such as vandalism. However like burglary trespass is often punished more severely when the property is a dwelling.Call the police nonemergency right away and report a trespassing and possible burglary into your home.Take a thorough inventory of your home.  Make note of anything missing count your checks make sure your bills are where they should be check jewelry everything.  Everything.  Hell check for cameras or listening devices based on what vile creeps your parents are.They have committed a crime.  Its not your fault they get caught its their fault for invading your home without permission.  This is no different than if two scabby crackheads walked into your home.Please call the police right away.

2715317,0,t1_cncgg92,Thanks. I wish the best for you too. I have basically lived my life having accepted I am unlikable and a loser. But as my brother just recently got engaged and I am now still back here in asia on these so called reunions theyve kicked up the favoritism just a notch so I am venting. Anyway I am going home soon and can once again escape this hell hole. Yeah same experience. My aunts and cousins are nicer to me. THey would say things that are exactly as you say completely opposite to what my parents will say. But anyway I think they are just throwing out BS to me. If there is anything I am it is I am able to be very honest with my own situation. The reality is I really am pretty ugly looking. Think Jack Ma level lookswise but minus the wealth of course. I am short for the west in asia Im ok. I also look really young for my age even for asian standards so I suppose this contributes to the lack of respect peoplestrangers generally show me also. I am of course also a loser as anybody can see that on paper. But Ive already lived with this understanding and have come to terms with it for many years. It might or might not have contributed to my recent spiraling down but I like being honest with myself than to try to be fed BS that isnt true. I figure knowing the truth at least provides me a platform to rigorously try to fix my problems if its ever possible. I guess I am approaching this like an engineering problem by identifying the faults and so they can be tackled properly. You dont build devices by feeding BS to yourself.

2725780,0,t3_2r9wtn,You never know. Its like prisoners who want to back to jail  they cant live outside of the cage so they get sent back. I argue the programming is stronger than you think because Ive seen it happen from childhood onto adulthood and their victims often end up with other narcissists in personal relationships. Its like Sith Lords looking for apprentices. Sometimes the victim cant function and needs to find it but the flipside is more insidious in that youre so obviously a conditioned person that youve got a big bullseye on you for other narcissists.Part of it is that once youre aware of narcissists you sort of see them more. Like when youre expecting you notice all of the pregnant women. But the other part is that they see you more. And if theyre really skilled you never see them coming.Thats why this is such a tragic subreddit  theres a cycle. One section of the people will become the narcissist themselves I already see it here with posts that are attentionseeking so it takes what I just said and magnifies it by thousands and another section will always have that blind spot made possible by a lifetime of abuse and programming for other narcissists to exploit. This subreddit is just getting started and I think the adult relationship component is going to come in time because of the process itself but eventually youll see more people posting about other relationships that arent parental. Narcissists are like sharks and their victims are like blood in the water. The main reason Im here is just to remind people like yourself to stay on your toes and give warnings from stuff Ive seen. Im fortunate to not have narcissistic parents but I have friends who do and Ive seen it.

They come from an entirely different root as you obviously know as I being on the spectrum and educated about it obviously know.But people reading similarish traits between Aspergers and Narcissism who are not as educated might think that said ish is only there for politeness sake and come to the conclusion that someone on the spectrum automatically has abusive traitsis incapable of empathy or other misconceptions about autism that are common which is why I found it so important to clarify.I do apologize for being so harsh while doing it though.,raisedbynarcissists,cngcdjw,2,t5_2we9n

GO TO THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY! this could allow you to take legal action against your father. sorry if some of my suggestions sound a little extreme but they worked on a mate of mine who had a physically abusive father. his father is now serving  years in prison for neglect child abuse and assault. he went to live with his non abusive mother in the same city i dont have abusive parents personally but i learned how to deal with them when i saw the situation my friend was in,raisedbynarcissists,cnka2kv,1,t5_2we9n

Unless OP has stolen money from her or helped her conceal her assets e.g. by accepting large gifts from her so she can fraudulently qualify for public assistance by appearing to be destitute there is absolutely no way she can get a court to order him to pay her a dime in support.  Even though there are a few states that have old statutes on the books that appear to allow this they are in conflict with and trumped by federal laws re Medicaid and also have no precedent in state law for actually being used in this way.  In a very few cases these state laws have been used as a shortcut to achieve a result that could also have been achieved through prosecution for fraudulent conveyance embezzlement etc but never to achieve a result where an adult child was ordered to pay any support in the absence of clear of evidence that the adult child had engaged in some unlawful activity regarding the parents finances.,raisedbynarcissists,cnn0rwr,2,t5_2we9n

I was the SC and sister was the GC. Nothing was ever good enough for her i.e. constantly criticizing everything I did or didnt do The birthday party thing really hit close to home too. My sister got to go out for expensive dinners while in my birthdays we had an awkward quiet dinner with burnt cake my mom hated baking. However even that is a step up from what you had to go through Before I went NC and I moved into my new place my Nmom would also constantly complain about how I never invited her over. Man I remember the first time I did it was awkward and terrible and my GC sister who also has N tendencies got into a fight with my SO.I think going NC is one of the best things you can do for yourself right now. Youre in recovery yourself congrats on this by the way!! and have also taken on the task of caring for your inlaws as well as your family you shouldnt have to deal with your Nmoms crazy making nonsense all at the same time.Ive been NC for about  or so years now and its the best decision I could have made. The first few weeks can be hard because youll feel like there is still hope that she might change but unfortunately Ive found that not to be true in my case.

Oddly within weeks of one another after about  years of NC with my family my step father a flying monkey for my NBPD mom made contact with me by email and my birth father called me.  I had different experiences on both sides.   My step father wanted to have a relationship with me and made apologies nothing from my mother though saying he didnt know about the abuse from my mom when me and my siblings were younger including his son with her.  After a year of emails with him I was invited to visit and at first my mother was so nice to me I wonder now if she sent her flying monkey to do her bidding all along but after several more visits over a year and a half I began to see the charade crumble and everything was absolutely no different than it was before and Id even say things were worse because my moms abusiveness was even more accepted than it was before.  My step father really thought that his apologizing for things in the past made everything alright but the apologies were more for his own self and not really for me because he hadnt changed at all and still allowed my mom to be cruel and abusive.  It was a a lot of wasted energies and effort on my part and required some counseling after the fact because it brought up some very painful emotions that I had repressed.My birth father on the other hand called me over the phone and started to cry because he said he wished he had called me sooner but just never could seem to do it.  He said he felt terrible about many things that he didnt do for me and my sisters for so many years.  I forgave him.  We lived across states but would call and talk now and then and he would send me cards for special occasions.  About three years after that call he was diagnosed with brain cancer and died this past October about a year later.

An perfectly neutral answer that wasnt exactly what they expected. A legitimate expression of concerndisapprovala hint of criticism. I see. Well theres nothing more to discuss then. Except when you take them on their word and leave they explode because apparently you did that on purpose to offend them. Christ I cant stand this passive aggressive bullshit.    Another one of my favorites  yes you said X but you obviously meant... or better but youre obviously thinking... cue in whatever they imagined you meant when you saiddid something completely unrelated projecting the fuck out of the most vile ridiculous grotesque shit they themselves are guilty of.

2840595,0,t1_cnqk4jc,I have many creative outlets  too many sometimes lol. It helps.  But what has honestly helped the most is introspection  recognizing those parts of myself that come from Nmom and knowing how unhealthy they are.  It has given me a clarity into my Nmoms antics that I never thought possible. Its like I can see her from the inside out  she is an open book.  I dont fall for her BS anymore and I feel free.Letting go of the past is hard because it is set  you cant reload your save game and try again.  All you can do now is move forward and make your life better for yourself because you DESERVE to be happy.  But that burden is squarely on your shoulders my friend.  No other person in this world can do that for you.  The key is to stay positive which is not always easy but does get easier with time.   Dont let your completely valid anger hold you back.  Your parents can only continue to hurt you if you allow them to  dont give them that power. ,raisedbynarcissists,cnqz0ng,1,t5_2we9n

However thats the insidiousness of narcissistic abuse. Everyone wants to  see the good in others. Even abused children want to believe their parents can become good people.OP was NC for six years and only renwed contact after her mother made a major life change and appeared to change herself for the better. She gave no timeline for how long passed between reestablishing contact and her current situation but the transition between lovebombing mother and claws out mother was likely slow.Be aware that we do not allow victim blaming here period.

Youre told youre a bad driver so you tense up trying desperately to remember every single rule of the road and watch every mirror etc  so much so that you end up paying more attention to trying to follow the rules than you do the road itself. So you miss something that you would have caught if youd been less preoccupied with trying to be a good driver  which reinforces your misperception that youre a BAD driver which restarts the cycle.Id listen to your husband.

But just getting out of the house and into a dorm was critical for me. I stopped puking after a month. Dont get me wrong it was hard. I was rather miserable at the dorm for a long time but at least it was an opportunity to develop mutual relationships instead of being mired in dysfunctional ones. At least I felt some hope.

He actually prefers I leave him a list of chores to do...If I do that he gets them all done without hesitation however I dont want to be put in that position of dictatorship. I dont like the idea of having to manage him. To me it feels like just another responsibility to tick off my list. I would prefer him to be self aware rather than me boss him around with sticky notes. Also Ive tried a chore chart but it never works out because our schedules are inconsistent.

2899533,0,t3_2tbcjz,Good for you!!! I know that to some people that may sound trivial as you said but that doesnt make it any less meaningful for you. So keep on celebrating everything you continue to build for yourselfwithout regard for what others may or may not think. As a friend said to me recently what someone else thinks about you is none of your business. Your experience of having to do all of the chores because your mother wouldnt really resonates with my experience with my first stepmom. She would do a white glove test to make sure everything on our stepbystep cleaning lists which varied from  pages per room was done to her standards. One thing she required was for very specific products to be used on certain items. For example the bottom of the bathtub had to be cleaned with Comet while the sides had to be cleaned with lemon oil. Dont ask me why anyone would want the sides of the tub to be cleaned with oil amp made to be even more slick than they already are all I know is that buffing that stuff off is a beast. If it wasnt exactly like she wanted we had to start all over again. So now I can get to my point Fastforward to me moving into my own apartment. My own celebration was not in cleaning something but rather in cleaning it without using specific productsand being able to make that decision without fear of any repercussions. My two older sisters fully understand my rule of no lemon oil being allowed in my house as they have the same rule in their own homes but few people get why that would be so meaningful to me. At first I felt kind of odd getting so excited over things like that as I compared myself to what others might think about it. And then I realized that I had been looking at it the wrong way. Its not me being weirdits that I happen to have additional things in life to celebrate that most people dont. And I have earned the right to celebrate every single one of those items! So please continue to be proud of yourself and celebrate each thing you doseemingly small or notthat continues to put you ahead in your life and away from your background. PS If youve not already done so I cant wait for you to transition to where theres not even the tiniest moment of mental dread about going home because the definition of home will have evolved to where its automatically one filled with feelings of peace joy and safety.

But since I have been VLC trying to be NC with Nmom my brother has been getting a larger taste of what she is really like. Im thinking another month or so before he loses it completely and tells her to go jump into a pit of rusty barbed poisontipped satan penises. I dont know what your family situation is but sometimes if you make the first NC move others will see the N for who they really are and come along with you. Hopefully that could be the case for you. You do not owe a liar anything. Do you have a good support system outside your mother and connected family? A husbandwife or SO? Friends who can keep you strong when if you start to waver thinking maybe she wasnt THAT bad because we all know an Ns favorite trick is to justify their abuse and make you feel like the crazy one for not liking being treated like shit. I find enormous comfort in my dog. Being her mommy has helped me to see how venomous my own mother really was. I know it is different than having human children but seeing the mother child dynamic from the other side really illuminated the cruelty of my mothers constant emotional and psychological abuse. Do you have a pet to snuggle with?Do you still live with your N? If so can you get out? Distance is crucial. I moved an hour away from Nmom. Of course then my brother bought her a house in the same town I moved to and now she is ever present but Im working on shutting her outMaybe its just how similar your situation sounds to mine and I feel a sense of commiseration... but if you need someone to talk to...

You could go with something like youre going NC with your mother but not them you dont want to discuss the reasons and you will not change your mind last part optional depending on your feelings about temporary or permanent NC.You can be sure of  things   at least one of your letters will be seen by the N and this is why you should not give reasons. Reasons give them an opportunity to explain themselves to you and others.  one or more relatives will try to get you to break NC. This is why a sparse message is best. You give them nothing to attack you with.Remember the rule when dealing with toxic people and potential flying monkeys no JADE justify argue defend explain.,raisedbynarcissists,cnzcpv8,3,t5_2we9n

3003323,0,t3_2uk9yi,I dont question your math but I do question his. I think kyr sharing expenses would not leave you much room for saving or other things. I wasnt able to stick to mo for food in college  years ago so I doubt thats a good number. But you can probably find cheaper car insurance  kyr seems steep even for a year old. Check out rpersonalfinance for budgeting ideas. Its doable and depending on your standard of living you can make it work. But thats not really the big question is it?The big question is ... what will make you happy? No matter what else he throws at you its your life. Your parents are free to offer their advice even to not agree with your choices but those choices are still yours and this life is still yours  with your mistakes to make.One trap that Ns are infamous for is having you explain yourself and then picking apart your reasons. Offer them no reasons other than this is my choice this is what I want. I understand the desire to be acknowledged respected and understood but I havent found that by explaining myself to Ns. Reasons are just things they can destroy until you kowtow to their desires. I know this sounds a bit devious but I would allow them to offer you financial support until they wont any longer. Starting life without a bunch of debt will help that k go further. Keep them at arms length but dont cave. Get your degree and then start your postcollege life. At that point decide if you want them in your life or if you want to cut all ties. ,raisedbynarcissists,co9ajdf,3,t5_2we9n

3017737,0,t3_2uoqxp,Im going to relate an old joke someone told me as a kid you would be one of the few who would REALLY appreciate it.There was once a small town the kind where people help one another kind of an Anywhere USA. They had gotten flood warnings and some people took it seriously and began to evacuate in advance of the coming storm. The hospital once it was vacated sent an ambulance with EMT to evacuate the few people left like the elderly or home bound or those simply uninformed. One man refused to leave. If God wanted me to leave hed tell meSo people began leaving in a mass exodus. A few hearty souls remained. As the waters rose some of the locals began ferrying out others in large vans. They passed him and told him he needed to leave the waters were already waist high and were only going to continue to rise.If God wanted me to leave hed get me outThey shook their heads and left him. A few hours later the man was on his roof the last safe place not under water. A news chopper was close by and the hovered over him begging him to get in as he was the last person in town. He held his ground or shingle lol and staunchly refused to budge.If God wanted me to leave hed get me out of here.So...very predictably the guy dies.At the pearly gates he faces St. Peter who shakes his head at him as he takes the mans name obviously disappointed as he opens the gates.The man asks St. Peter...why did I die? I was devout I prayed and I begged God to save me from the flood...why didnt he answer my prayers?Before St. Peter could answer a voice boomed down from aboveI sent you an ambulance a van and a HELICOPTER what more did you WANT?!!,raisedbynarcissists,coasbcp,3,t5_2we9n

3022694,0,t3_2urga1,Last month nfather sent me a three page long ! message via Facebook stating that he was sexually abused as a child he didnt say who sexually abused him though. As horrible as this sounds I dont know if I believe him because he is a pathological liar. If he is trying to garner sympathy from me its far too late. And even if he had told me this long ago it wouldnt have changed a thing. He never brought this up until last month in said Facebook message. He also said that as a child he was locked in rooms for hours at a time played in garbage dumps and feared for his life constantly. Again no mention of this was made until last month when I received a mysterious text message instructing me to check my Other folder on Facebook which I did just in case nfather was threatening to show up at my house or place of employment which he did. Nfather also compared growing up in the neighborhood that he did was on par with fears of the Cuban missile crisis. I should state that the neighborhood nfather grew up in was at least fifty years ago a very nice neighborhood in which to live and raise a family...but for some bizarre reason he saw it as a wartorn ghetto. Nfather also said that he is the way he is because he had to do the standard duck and cover drills in school. After all that he basically said This is what I went through. Walk a mile in my shoes.

A dead line needs to be set as to when he is going to make a decision and stick to it stop dancing around it and accepting excuses from them because i can gaurentee you your wifes acceptance of their behavior will not outlast your own. His parents have been alive a lot longer than you two and Ive met  year olds more responsible and respectable than what you describe them asAnd i dont like children. Man up your wife is being hurt and your child life was threatened force repercussions on the actions of your careless parents of what they are doing and stand by your decisions. Dont lie to yourself that this isnt threatening your marriage cause it damn well is. while it might not be much of a threat now if something isnt done about it it will be.Its only going to get worse and he needs to decide if his marriage is more important to him than a relationship with his parents. They will not stop doing this and keeping contact with them only enables them to hurt you all more.Blood is thicker than water.No its...blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb.Sorry if that was a bit harsh.,raisedbynarcissists,cobkmt8,3,t5_2we9n

The focus of this community is on helping people and encouraging hate for hates sake just isnt how you do that. I think parents who have lovingly and thoughtfully raised their children sell themselves short when they argue that you only have one family! as do their children when they argue the same. Years of care and consideration cant be erased by a few mistakes nor can years of abuse and illtreatment be fixed by an apology and forgiveness.

I also have taken a rather dim view of Godordie in the past and while I see the healing effect of God Hes not boxed into little formulas and categories I draw up for him. Its my own pettiness sometimes. I know hes a good guy and Ive had a powerful experience with him that Im not shy about talking about. If you feel pulled or alienated thats on you. You make a good point though its also been a stretch to let go and trust people who arent religious. Ive been realizing that the past week or so.

3075360,0,t1_cogr2dp,My soon to be mom in law introduced it to me I think she suspected my hair wasnt actually super straight. And Ooh that sounds beautiful.. And super freaking awesome!!. Might have to check that place out as my hair is over halfway down my back slowly inching past my chest because Im fairly well endowed and my hair ends up looking way shorter from the front than the back. Ive been growing it out for a year now from shoulder length with regular trims my hair grows an inch and a half a month. Anyways what is with that? I couldnt even handle the crunch of nmothers hair and always liked my own because I had soft hair but I felt really bad about that and couldnt figure out why.. My nmother has like A wavy hair so the top of her hair was always matted to her skull and the rest would fall normally into slight waves and it just looked so off and She never let it get past her shoulder bones because that was long and bad somehow... I dont know... I just dont get how money must mean good in their heads... Nmother always complained about her hair and complained to me about mine not being like hers OR being exactly like hers and how she couldnt figure out why I had to look sooo much better with it naturally saying so in such a way that really its a guilt trip for her insecurities and I was Supposed to respond saying shes so much prettier than me but I stopped doing that when I was .

3078831,0,t3_2vf05w,Hi Im just outside London and Ive been through the restraining order thing  not with parents with a stalker.Its a long hideous expensive process.  You wont get any change out of k and your chances of an order being granted are low. Thats unless your problem person has already been convicted of physically assaulting you  if youre in that position its a whole other ball game.Without actual violence against you the police physically cant help  although you might find a decent copper will do you a favour and have a word with your problem person. So if the problem is only threats and nastiness its a civil matter not criminal.So youll need a solicitor willing to take a restraining order case for starters.  Not easy as most solicitors wont take them theyre a pain and solicitors worry the problem person will take it out on them as your representative! and a lot of solicitors in the UK dont want a case where theyll have to physically represent you in court  they only want paperwork cases.  So be prepared to pay a LOT of money for a solicitor mine was  per hour plus VAT and expenses.To get the Order without having some injuries to show ! youll need a huge pile of absolutely watertight evidence.  Its all but impossible.  You have to keep in mind that youre asking a judge to curtain the freedom of another person at your request.  Thats a big ask.Your evidence will also be picked apart. For example If you have a letter from your problem person saying Im going to kill you the first question to you will be Under UK law thats malicious communication?  It would be more appropriate that you follow an action for Malicious Communication than a restraining order why arent you doing that?I guess what Im trying to say is its expensive timeconsuming souldestroying and really just shows problem person that they did have an effect on you.Id also remind you that because its a civil action not criminal if the Restraining Order is breached the police wont get involved not unless theres also a criminal offence taking place.  If problem person breaches that Order but doesnt cause a criminal offence they wont be arrested  youll have to pay for another civil court case to impose the Order.Good luck if you go for an Order but I really wouldnt recommend it unless youre a millionaire or theres already been a successful prosecution for violence.   It really is NOTHING like the ProtectionRestraining order process our US friends have.,raisedbynarcissists,coh49x6,6,t5_2we9n

Apparently there are two main types of personalities both stemming from a lack of affection in childhood . Aggressive typeBasically demands attention and love by acting up..Passive type meDoes everything for the narcissistic parent in hopes of getting attentionlove in return. As for me I always felt like if I didnt get enough love it was because I didnt deserve to get love so I made myself work harder be more kind generally try to be as perfect in the eyes of my mom as I can be. That does not mean Im a perfectionist because she hates perfectionism and Ive trained myself to be laid back about some things.

3127402,0,t1_com4gk9,Thank you for sharing your view I think that peoples frustration at the fact that some PTSD specialists only work with vets is not because we dont think vets need specialized care but instead are wondering where all this specialized care is for the children who grew up surrounded by traumatic events and are now adults seeking help I wont even go into the children still living in abusive situations.I dont say this to diminish either group as I dont believe in upping anothers trauma I just want to point out that the trauma from emotional abuse is often severe and can be debilitating too in some cases children who are now adults never got to learn any healthy coping mechanisms that adult soldiers may have been taught by training or their caregivers growing up. Some survivors never get the chance to go to therapy some are never believed or validated some are never even registered at birth or have their official identification taken away and cannot exercise their rights because of their parents actions. Their very personhood is at stake growing up.What soldiers on the front line go though is undoubtedly traumatic. What children of emotional sexual and physical abuse experience is undoubtedly traumatic. Unfortunately the abuse children are subjected to usually is prolonged the cycle of abuse repeats for years and years and not just a single event especially when it is perpetrated by a parentcaregiver like many in this sub thus the damages are far reaching and honestly it means some survivors of abuse need more therapycounselling than the average person just because they were traumatized SO MANY times. These traumatic events can make individuals as unstable and dangerous to themselves and others as anyone else with PTSD just because abused children have been finding ways to cope with things for longer making some appear more functional and okay than they really feel doesnt mean they dont have a breaking point and so many feel they could benefit from counselling yet cant afford itcant find a specialistdont have the skills to find a counsellor etc. AND if they dont actively seek out a support system will have very few people to turn to because their family is abusive!So thats my take on it this sort if turned into a novel but social support for survivors of abuse is something Im very passionate about. I did a bit of research comparing the supports when I found out that my country trains and provides official service dogs for those with diagnosed severe PTSD. When I contacted them to inquire about the qualifications required have to live within a certain distance PTSD diagnosed by an MD etc. they let me know that they were only available for veterans with PTSD. Made me feel like my abuse was not real. The verbal emotional and sexual abuse I endured for over  years IS REAL.

I also have ZERO respect for therapists as I view them as treating people blindly  in most cases willfully so  Im not about to trust someone that treats such a profession into a guessing game  I dont care how  professional  they are . I mean no offense to you I just have a strongly negative opinion of therapists. While I admit that their guess work  can  help SOME people. Im also aware that not everyone is open to it  I count myself among them . If its up to guess work than the random anonymous public at large can guess with the best of them as far as Im concerned. However for those that chose to go and its helped them good. Good for them. But Im not about to divulge everything to someone on the off chance they  might  be able to help. I tend to think in a risk  reward scenario where I weigh the risk vs the reward. For me the risk of  trusting  people almost always outweighs the reward. Thus its rarely  if ever   worth it .

I now have said license and a PAID OFF car. To this day Im still shocked by it. It might not be perfect but this subreddit is my chosen therapy.

Its horrifying that anyone would use someone elses illness much less their own childs to draw attention to themselves so that they might bask in the glow of sympathy. And to blame you for having a stroke and making everyone sad is just beyond the pale. Like how dare your body be fallible and you inconvenience everyone right?Not as terrifying or as drastic as your story but midway through college my father refused to stop paying for my therapy and antidepressionantianxiety medication. He said I was wasting his money and I didnt need anything to be strong. He was angry that I was discussing anything with a therapist because from his point of view I didnt have real problems. Of course he was a total hypocrite who kept seeing his own psych and taking lorazepam.Well of course if you suddenly stop taking antidepressants you can have all sorts of terrible side effects like extended depressive episodes and an increase in suicidal thoughts. Which is what happened to me. By the time I got to law school I was a total wreck. I was out of the house married and financially independent by then so I could have gotten therapymeds easily but I just kept hearing my dads words in my head. To me medicationtherapy  weakness and I didnt want to be weak. I also hadhave a deepseated phobia of doctors but thats another story. This resulted in quite a few depressive episodes during my first year of law school that had a resounding effect on my law school career after that I passed but my performance was lackluster to say the least and I was suicidal after receiving my first semester grades. It could have killed me and it was through sheer luck that it didnt.My brother is in his late s and still lives at home. Hes severely obese. He doesnt know how to cook or drive so he depends on my parents to get him food. They dont deny him anything he asks for so most days he eats fast food for breakfast lunch and dinner. Ive tried to get him to take steps towards moving out. But hes convinced that my parents are literally the greatest parents of all time and hes bought into their narrative that Im selfish and dont put family first because I moved out. Plus my father frequently belittles him and undermines his selfworth so I dont think he believes that he could do anything with his life. But I do think living with them is literally killing him.,raisedbynarcissists,coqgdn6,4,t5_2we9n

I know with my mother the trauma also runs too deep for her to ever be able to change. She should also be well in to her s now which means her patterns have been carved in to her mind so deep that I think its impossible. Plus Im not sure that even if she started now shed have enough time left. I do generally view her with compassion though what I feel most of the time when I think about her these days is sadness. I think its one of the saddest things in this world when you want to love your children but you just cant or dont know how to. I cant imagine a mother having to live like that but mine does.Ive been taught enough about narcissism to have a pretty good idea where it comes from and I believe it comes from a place of intense sadness and loneliness. Compassion is better than hate but Ive found over the last  years that it takes a very strong mind to resist resuming contact because of compassion. Compassion makes you want to help but in all of my life so far all it has ever yielded is backstabbing betrayal insults on such levels that it tears your soul to threads.

Plus my nMom never actually thought to even attempt to teach me to drive probably out of fear Id wreck her Mustang ha. Cooking I never learned properly until I was well out of the house.

How do you prepare the chicken? And secrets on how to get the sauce this good? etc. She responds by mumbling something about how the recipe might not be exactly the same but she showed me how to make lasagna when I was a kid.

Let him hell back out of the trip angrily hoping you beg him to come after all that guilt comes crashing down. Then go with your friend. If he agrees to stay at a hotel then you travel to the concert together and see it then you part your ways maybe that would be bearable?

I take care of my kids and keep improving in my relationship with them its a work in progress. Ive made a difference in peoples lives in many small ways. You get the idea.

3230955,0,t3_2x4tje,I dont think youre wrong here. In just an attempt to translate Im hearing your friend tell you she doesnt have the emotional energy or capacity to discuss issues outright with you. She didnt appreciate that you were honest about something upsetting you and she didnt understand that its hard for you to bring it up in the first place. Or if she did shes too busy with her own issues to consider your feelings. Maybe you two are just not compatible friends and thats ok. Some people dont have bad intentions but they are selfabsorbed and theres not enough room for other peoples thought and feelings in the relationship. Which to me makes it a relationship not worth putting much effort into.I think its a tremendous step that you had the conversation and I hope you feel proud of yourself. You were silenced for a long time and that wasnt fair. But I think thats where your guilt is coming from not because you actually did anything wrong.,raisedbynarcissists,coww6uf,6,t5_2we9n

Nothing was wrong with it she just didnt like the color any more. She knew that school was the one thing I really cared about. I knew it was my ticket out of my hometown and finally away from them. She was conflicted I think though because I went to a locally prestigious college and she really loved to brag about it to her work mates. It is SO exhausting.

When I was in high school I played basketball. My mother would frequently come in after practices and games screaming at me about whatever she was mad at me for at the time causing a scene and trying to humiliate me in front of everyone. After a while people started turning to me and saying that it was my fault she acted that way. That maybe if I just did what she wanted she wouldnt be that way. She was the one acting out and humiliating me yet I was the one getting judged for it. It made me mad that they would say this because its not like I wanted to be yelled at and humiliated in front of my friends.There is definitely a stereotype put on people with parents like ours.

I married a man who wanted me at  deadened my feelings of pain by using drugs and it turned out to be a nightmare as he was a N wackjob control freak uncaring and  years later crazy drinking out all night doing worse drugs and then made my children alienated from me when I divorced him. What changed for me was when I was  I gave my life to God. I asked him to take my life as His and guide me and give me wisdom.  I felt him in the room this huge loving presence.  Real love.  I am not a fundamentalist but I have found that being grounded with God as my best friend is the only thing that saved me in life. It took years to get my life straightened out and to divorce that Nhusband but every problem I have had I ask for guidance and wisdom and it comes eventually. Having children showed me how to give love unconditionally and I stopped using drugs when I had them. My life still has pain everyones does but I feel able to cope for the most part as I have grown older. So perhaps it is better not to jump into a bad relationship early on until you feel able to love yourself.

How having a difficult child will always provide opportunity for growth and that she thanks God she doesnt go to church or read the bible or talk about religion unless its in relation to me but loves to cite God when it comes to me for the daily challenges that having a child like me has provided her. Gosh the more I write about this the more I remember. As I was reading through the list I was thinking well she has one or two traits of an Nmom. Maybe three.

Its scary. And SO MANY people with these diagnoses KNOW they had a lot of stress but how many more of them DONT realise that YES emotional abuse IS abuse too. Just take this sub how many make threads about I dont really think I was abused because it was just some yelling and maybe a very random slap maybe several times a week but maybe I did something wrong because thats what Ive been told all my life. You see my point? Dont ask about the word abuse ask people to cross off behaviour their parents had. See what statitics that gives!! So my health. I have a lot of the AF symptoms main two are aches and pains everywhere I swear I am  years old. And I have so fucking exhausted some days I cant get anything done. Other days I am a lot better but I still have a limit on how much stuff I should do in a couple of days. This  I have to sort out doctors welfare buying and making food keeping my house tidy I am constantly on very close to empty. I had to cancel an appointment with some councellor thing I have once a week because fuck if I was getting out of bed and walking  minutes to the office. How I try to get better. I read up on various herbal stuff because I dont believe in big pharma. Extra magnesium and bvitamins and having normal levels of iron and dvitamins help a lot so I do this. I get worse quick if I have to wait a month to replace something that I run out off. I treat each thing separatly Massage pillow for aches helps them go away faster. St Johns for depression. Fennel and licorice can apparently kickstart your adrenals in the morning so I do teas with them instead of coffee most days. Coffee makes me totally depressed and that makes me even more exhausted  for emergency energy only!!I plan everything so that Okey friday i have a thing dont use energy the day before go shopping wednesday instead.

Doing something like banning you from the computer for a period of time maybe a week would have been an appropriate discipline.Low grades sibling disagreements  Siblings fight it happens. Short term grounding having phone removed pocket money suspended that kind of thing is more appropriate. As for low grades this is something that needs positive attention for example if you manage to get your grades up and keep them up then you get a reward. Unfortunately narcs never seem to deal in positive reinforcements.Lying about work schedule  Im not sure why you did this but grounding plus needing to provide a written work schedule would have been better.

So every time she spewed her angry hurtful bullshit I looked her in the eyes and smiled just to piss her off.  I mean when youre at the end of your rope have fun with it right?  What did I have to lose?  No fucks given.No you are not her.  Your mother hates herself and shes trained you to hate yourself in order to not be alone in her misery.  Or better said shes not able to handle anyone elses happiness when shes so miserable.  Unfortunately it seems to be working.  Right now suffering is the only thing that seems real and valid and achievable and somehow youve found a strange comfort in that.  I dont blame you its called survival.  Getting outside of that box seems overwhelming.But it doesnt stay this way forever.  And YES YOU CAN CHANGE.  Dont worry about being a good person at this point.  What the fuck does good person mean anyway?  As long as you know somethings wrong here thats a good first step.  You dont need to lie to yourself or try to act like something youre not if theres anything were good at its seeing through the fairytale bullshit.Use the piss and vinegar in your veins to get your health on track.  Take your vitamins.  YouTube some yoga videos or whatever works for you.  Start easy.  All this may sound stupid but do it anyway.  At least youd be doing something she would never do.  Easier said than done I know but small changes are key and the first steps are critical dont overwhelm yourself with goals that require huge leaps because fuck that that helps no one.  And honestly nothing is more satisfying than being something your mother could never be  Healthy.  What better punishment than to rub that in her face?  I mean really rub that in her face?  No personality changes needed.  If therapy is an option jump on it.  If not use the subs here as support groups.  Venting about it helps especially when people can cheer you on and give you perspectives that you may not have considered.  Art can also be great therapy and it can be anything.  Want to stab a piece of paper over and over again with a ballpoint pen?  Go to town.  Then frame that shit and hang it up.

And yet she almost never messages me. When we do talk she just gives me a  minute monologue about herself. Theres another thing I dont understand. She has never been good at calling me. But she has often made the excuse that she doesnt want to bother me at work. I always make sure she knows my working hours. And even when she calls me and leaves a voicemail I always return her call immediately that I see the missed call. I reply to her messages quickly too. But she keeps using this same excuse. Ive told her so many times. It used to hurt me really badly because I thought there must be another reason she didnt want to talk to me. But then I realised. Shes never been interested in me. My sister always. My brother sometimes. But Im not interesting for her. And I never will be. Even though Ive achieved more on paper.

Yes this will be something you will deal with as go through life and it is wonderful that youve had this insight so early in life. One thing  I would caution you about if you are still in high school and you speak to a counselor.  You might want to say your parents have narcissistic traits rather than call them nparents.

Artist writer thinker dreamer creator... the kind of person who thinks that its not enough to get to know people in terms of their likes or dislikes but will ask you What is the meaning of life to you if you think there is one? Why? or Out of all the fictional characters you know  TV shows books movies etc.  which characters or types of characters do you tend to like and which ones do you find yourself relating to the most if those categories arent the same for you? Why do you think you like those characters even though you relate more to these characters? Like what specifically do you see in them that reminds you of yourself?I make people think about things they might not have thought of before or havent thought of in a long time. I ask the deep questions not to trick people or trip them up but because I genuinely am curious about their answers and want to know more about them. It helps me to learn more about myself too  do I agree with their answers? Disagree? Why or why not?Doing this makes me happy too. It makes me feel fulfilled in life because it satisfies my thirst for knowledge not in textbook or factual knowledgeintelligence but in interpersonal or social knowledge. I like learning how someone works and I love it when they surprise me because I get to learn more about them from that too.Unfortunately this hasnt helped me figure anything out in terms of my goals or ambitions in life. I just want to learn everything experience everything. I feel horribly limited by my humanity my humanness yet thats what I find so thrilling about life too. Its like an insatiable wanderlust for life.My chosen family are my friends and they will sometimes spin this game on its head and ask me the deep questions. I often find myself answering I dont know right away before pausing to collect my thoughts and then answer what or how I think.I think that lots of things are possible even if we cant yet prove that they exist. Maybe the proverbial bright white light you see when you die is the infant you being literally rebirthed into the world. I think that our souls are the energy left over from our nervous system when we die because where else is that energy to go? Maybe ghosts because its often said that spirits haunt our world due to having unfinished business or dying suddenly are the energysouls trapped in another planedimension unable to move on and be rebirthed. Maybe aliens have already contacted us but it was when we were all Neanderthals and the aliens decided to bounce. Maybe heaven and hell exist after all. Maybe they dont. But Ill find out when I get there  for now I have this life in this world to live and focus on.So thats me... femme Mulder essentially.

3528184,0,t3_30o9c6,Some people may argue with me about this but keep sentimental items. One or two stuffed animals. A blanket. Stuff like that. You cant replace sentimental items and they really help in the future when you regress from triggers and need childhood comfort because you know parents werent comforting in childhood so you bury yourself into your blanky instead. Other items that you like but arent comforting or anxietyreducing may be hard to part with especially if you get attached to stuff like me but keep in mind that those items can be replaced with money. Thats like books or mugs or objects that you like and dont want to lose but can be replaced because the original has no primary significance beyond the actual object itself as convoluted as that sounds.Try to change your bank account details so your Nparents cant access it or view it. Someone mentioned IDs and documents. Those are really important. Electronics.

3529326,0,t3_30pbeh,Gah. I have heard the NC is punishment line before on boards that support parents whose children are not in contact with them. It goes as far as saying we the parents are not the abusers because they are NC with us. They are punishing us therefore we the parents are the abused.I think that is a load of hogwash and horse crap.It comes down to intention and consequence. I would say almost all of us go NC because of selfpreservation first and foremost. We stay NC because we know the bloodsucking nature of dealing with someone with Ntraits. After a lifetime of dealing with an abusive parent who better knows the true nature of the abuser than the abused?The consequence of NC is the Nparent not getting the chance to continue the abuse. That has an element of punishment in it. But it is the same kind of punishment as someone has who smoked tobacco for  years and developed lung cancer. Some people who smoke never get cancer. Some do. Some kids with Nparents stay in contact. Others go NC. Are there people who use NC as a punishment against another person? Yes.

Comparing what others are saying about situations and what they are saying about the same situations also says a lot. As a child and adolescent therapist I never did the initial diagnosis for a patient with NPD I did not specialize in the treatment of personality disorders but I worked with several kids who had Nparents or other N family members. You get good at knowing what to look for gaslighting is always a big red flag and again its those interpersonal interactions that are key.Personality disorders are rarely easy to diagnose. Patients can be in therapy for years and still not be diagnosed properly the tendency to hop from care provider to care provider andor in and out of therapy altogether is common and really interferes. I have a relative who were she my patient would be diagnosed as BPD but she is still being treated unsuccessfully as bipolar. Therapist hopping has kept her from being accurately diagnoseddealing with her issues but Im not in a position to get involved.One of my professors in grad school was a personality disorders expert and maintained a private practice. He said that roughly  of PD patients can be treated successfully. With the other  you get a mixed bag of results. Some therapists are born to treat PDs. I was not one of them.

They want to know that whoever is in charge has been placated so theyll have peace. With normal people you dont get anything as clear cut as that. You have to give and take you have to relate in real ways. The ambiguity of real relationships is a constant source of anxiety. But with an N theres no ambiguity. The price of peace submission is clear. So the E pays it and gets a sense of peace. The emotional blackmail gives them both what they want.This is why Es and Ns find each other and stay together they give each other what they want. The N wants to be in charge and the E wants to have a clear emotional authority figure whose price is clear.Im really glad youre feeling purged though!

I know it doesnt really but I go into panic mode because when my nmom was upset there was yelling and throwing and hitting and all that. So everything in me is geared toward trying to make sure that doesnt happen.I think that Im not quite at the point where I can go without apologizing. I think Im still at the stage where I apologize for reassurance. Maybe once I get enough reassurance that the other person isnt going to freak on me Ill stop apologizing so much? I dont know. Its not peers or friends per se just authority figures. I do apologize too much to friends too but they tend to be ... callous apologies... Sort of like an offhand sorry if I accidentally knock hands with them or something like that. Like Im not scared of them blowing up on me and if they did Id be um shocked but also kind of whoa okay... Im out of here. Whereas with adults if they blew up on me Id have a melting breakdown.

If its said gently and in relation to something terrible such as war or natural disasters and when the child is old enough to understand the true meaning of what life is then it would be a normal discussion. When said aggressively in response to minor injustices the are within the control of the parent and to a child far too young to possibly understand how heavy the phrase is and its true meaning then it isnt normal at all.

My dad is dark haired and dark skinned dark hair olive skin gray eyes  the rest of the kids in the family are light haired blonde or red and light skinned.

Its a spectrum disorder Im probably on the border of what is normal some expert would say I have it some would say I dont. Im in medical school now.

I told you that because I believe I have some insight into the autistic community and let me tell you what I read here provoked me. I am sorry but it did. Your sons mental health regardless of age is not for you to share on facebook. It is not for you to grief over it is not for you to gain pity it is not about you. I have no doubt that being the parent of someone on the autism spectrum can be hard  no doubt. But let me tell you he will grow up maybe he will do wonderful things regardless of what everyone thought because that do happen. You have no idea how much some of us adapt and improve with age. Or maybe he will never quite fit in and always struggle with his disorder. Maybe a bit of both. Regardless he would feel horrible about finding out you shared his most intimate issues like that you made it about yourself. You may not have intended to but you did. And regardless if he ever reads that post I can tell you he will stumble into the community of parents of autism spectrum kids they share their struggles their pains and their griefs about not having a normal child online and let me tell you reading it fucking hurts. It fucking hurts.

He threw them out last Sunday and went camping with friends this week. I blocked their phone numbers from his phone. Its a small but important step. It isnt weak to be this way. It just means that they exploited his kindness and good nature again and again. They taught him to accept being treated like absolute shit and he has nothing to compare it to really. He only started learning healthy dynamics because we are both determined to live a healthy life together and have a great marriage. So being manipulated by your parents doesnt mean you are weak it just means they are evil.,raisedbynarcissists,cqgladg,3,t5_2we9n
3726380,0,t3_332es1,Im fairly asexual and in middle school that was an odd experience because I had delayed puberty due to genetic disorder amongst other things. When I got interested in it some people in the neighborhood I lived in showed me some things. Naturally when they cant tell you anymore you go to the internet. So I look up oral sex related things on youtube because well youtube has videos right? Wrong. Found nothing of course. Mom finds it and has my computer science degree brother block everything except things that are approved on my computer for like  years. In like grade  I yelled at him to remove it for a week and he did probably because it was annoying for him to have to approve websites every other day while hes in university trying to study.I eventually resorted to wikipedia to read things. I should add that seeing porn at young ages can really screw with your head so not seeing it was probably for the better. But there way of preventing me from learning about sex was really shame inducing like how dare I have an interest at all. Normal people would sit their kids down and chat openly about it not in my house! Youre not allowed to have feelings!All they ended up teaching me was how to be extremely devious and lie to them more. The whole If this environment isnt safe for me to share Ill hide my real feelings and just lie to your face about it. My Ndad has never actually talked about it.. but when I reached puberty he sort of started ignoring me and has been that way the last years so... not exactly Mr conversationalist. As for how it affected me in relationships Ive done a few things and I notice Im not entirely there. Like Im doing it and having fun and whatnot but I can literally disconnect emotionally on command and involuntarily. The other person seems way more into it than I do too which I find odd. ,raisedbynarcissists,cqh16mz,7,t5_2we9n

3730320,0,t3_334lfp,To look like your abuser  augh it is the worst thing nature can give you. So sorry! I do look more like my dad who passes away long time ago mostly my eyes and forehead are like him  I am lucky. But I still have a lot of features like my eye color and my hair color like NM. Therefore I color it! I always wear makeup she never does and I changed the shape of my eyebrows by plunking them  that was enough to give me a different look. Still as I grow older I see her face sometimes watching me from the mirror and I get frozenlike. I hate any part of my face that resembles her. I just realized that the N abuse might be the reason why people like Renee Zellweger get such transformation through surgeries. So I googled her relationship with her mother and guess what... I am not claiming anything about this beautiful soul at all no diagnosis here  but in an interview on for the Inside The Actors Studio she claims that she was outside a lot by herself a lot playing by herself and taking long walks outside  just lonely outside the house all the time... and that she did not watch TV because TV was not allowed at home We had strict rules at home you know she smiles kinda. Was she abused? Who knows. But plastic surgery might have helped her get out of that lookinglikeyourmother stigma.You may want to try to change your looks by trying a professional makeover.

In fact I feel only disgust that you could abuse such smart kind wonderfulseeming kids like Yeknomeca and siblings in such a twisted messedup fashion. There is absolutely NO excuse for denying your children PROPER DOCTORAPPROVED medical care that you have access to. Like literally none.

Your responsibility to your child is to go beyond your own needs and comfort for their own. And if that means not getting as much sympathy as youd like or having to do research on scary medical opinions then that is what you do.Munchausens by proxy may be considered a condition but I refuse to validate your narcissism by calling it an illness or sickness.

3770450,0,t3_33ikec,I know its not terribly helpful but I work in the cancer field as a cytotechnologist. I look at cells under the microscope and determine if they are bad or not.I have no idea if you are in the United States but I just wanted to give you a run down on why results take a bit longer sometimes.So youre sitting  laying there and they take a biopsy. It travels in a little plastic cup to the gross room where they describe it chop it up and send it over to the histology department. There they put it into a preservative so that they can make it nice and hard and get all the water of the cells out. They then put the bits of you in hot wax and this allows it to be cut on a microtome. Think of an itty bitty deli slicer.They take these biopsy slices and put them on glass slides. They stain them and then a pathologist can look at them. This whole process can take  to  hours.The diagnosis can take one or two days especially if they want some more slides to do special testing. The special testing allows us to narrow down exactly what kind of cancer you have.If its sent to a medical board that still doesnt necessarily mean you have cancer. I go to medical boards regularly. Basically the best surgeons oncologists and pathologists all get in a room and talk about how to treat the patient. Its pretty neat because instead of a second opinion you get like thirty. And they arent afraid to speak their minds. Also another HUGE red flag. Tell your doctor you do not want your mom to know your results. In the U.S. That is a HUGE HIPPA violation. Fines and firing for the doctor and the practice. It is ILLEGAL unless you fill out paperwork saying its okay. Most other countries have the same protections in place. ,raisedbynarcissists,cqm24r5,2,t5_2we9n

3771181,0,t1_cqm0a5m,Now that I have more time to sit and read this more thoroughly Im happy to be a sounding board. gt I have found a decent loan and a bank that specialises in cosigning loans for selfemployed people. As of today I am about halfway through writing the application. Ill keep my fingers crossed for you! I do hope you get the loan AND that the loan terms are resonable.gthelpful. Its nice to have friends. A few years ago I never would have asked for help with anything but today I had supportive conversations with  good friends and my brother.This is a hard skill to learn and Im glad that youve got people to support you in person. Theres only so much the internet can do  and I cant see your face hear your voice or use any of those nonverbal cues to assess how a person is doing. gtI had a talk with my client on Friday and they were enthusiastic about my writing so far. They are looking into sending me more regular work and we also discussed my helping them out with some social media consulting. Its possible that I will earn enough this month paid at the earliest end of May to get through June just. More importantly they are the most respectful client I have ever had.Thats fantastic! Im really glad that you have a supportive client. If I sound like a repetitive cheerleader heres the thing. I find that a lot of people forget to remember their accomplishments and the good things in life. Sure there are future hurdles to overcome but its also important to remember look back and see what you have already accomplished to understand what youre capable of. gt  Nevertheless Im still very untrusting and paranoid about whether theyll pay me at all. I have no evidence to support my paranoia so I think it is a flea.Knowing is half the battle. The other half is telling the negative voice to shut the hell up and keep moving forward.gt According to the banks website I can expect to hear back within  working days during which time I will work for my current client and market myself as a writer. I will also see if I can skype my friends parents and talk to them in person. Failing that I also thought of another friend who has lent me money in the past. I feel shameful asking for money but she might be willing to help me again.I find no fault with your plan it sounds like you are exploring every option that you can use to move toward selfsufficiency and thats a good thing. gt I also have a medical bill due on the th which would eat up a decent amount of my remaining reserves. Just a suggestion but it might help  can you talk to their billing department and ask if you can get on a reduced payment plan based on your income? I dont know if the medical billing system works like that in Germany but some medical places in America do allow patients to pay on a sliding scale. Its worth asking anyways and might help you float a little better until you have more regular cash flow.gt On the other hand it is my birthday on Saturday and there is a reasonable chance that my wealthy Nparents will send me some money which is likely to cover said bill. I feel you on that one. I feel a bit strange in the RBN forums because I am not NC with my annoyingly financially successful nmomedad. I had some good friends who councelled me not to  burn bridges with my crazy parents but to see them as resources and treat them with a modicum of respect  ie if I ask them for something be respectful but it also doesnt mean stand there and take their shit. So its a really wierd balance to maintain but I just want to let you know its doable but I wouldnt recommend it if you are not able to walk away if they get too crazy. Thats basically how I go into every interaction with them I will walk away if they get too nuts. gtI dont know how Im going to make it but I do feel that if I can battle my way from here to a stable set of writing clients I should finally be okay after  years of job failures. I still dont believe I can get to that point however. I brought up my lack of selfbelief in therapy and my therapist couldnt make sense of what I was saying. Thats probably because my fears are mostly irrational catastrophising. But they are what they are  and they are still causing me a lot of angst.Quick question  are you able to recognize that youre catastrophizingletting yourself get into a downward spiral? Also do you have friends who can talk to you in person to gently say No endofapril youre a good person youve accomplished this much and Im perfectly willing to sit here and listen to your fears but Im going to remind you when they are unfounded and what youre capable of. It takes a while to build that sort of skill and stress can totally throw a person back into that negative thought loop. You are rightly worried about being a responsible adult who can pay their billstheir rent and feed themselves. Thats perfectly normal. But it can also be a giant trap fror negative spirals and maintaining that balance between addressing real responsibilities and real worries with the negative thought patterns that nparents create is a tough line to walk. I still need my boyfriend to get me through the periods of bad selfdoubt where Im so terrified of failure that I dont want to move forward. gt I believe in my ability to be a good writer. FWIW you are extremely talented to be this fluent in english and german. I am the child of immigrants and only fluent in one language. gt What I doubt is my ability to manage all of these things in the absence of money in my bank. I think the bank will reject my loan application and I doubt that I will have enough money to get myself to the point where I have  writing clients. I hear your worries and they are perfectly normal worries with a touch of catastrophizing. Deal with what you can do now. Recognize that there are things outside your control Bank approval. Accept that you are doing everything that you can to get to selfsufficiency Searching for more clients. Focus on what you CAN do not on what you cant do. gt I think that I might have to sell furniture belongings to survive May which would cause me unbearable anxiety and shame. I worry about being judged by my flatmate and date if they see things like my wardrobe vanish from my bedroom. And I also think said shame will make it much harder for me to work selfpromote. Finally I worry that I will be so anxious about money that all the good habits I have built up relationships food sleep drinking water hygiene walking will fall by the wayside.Does meditating help you? Deep breathing exercises? Because this is defifnitely a negative thought loop that is easy to fall into. I can pointcounterpoint the logcial fallacies in these worries but the more important piece of the discussion is whether or not you believe. I said earlier that people who judge you negatively for doing what you need to do sell things or whatnot to get selfsufficient are people you probably wont want in your life. Things are things the more important question is if they care about your ability to take care of yourself. If they dont well then did you really want to be around someone like that? Can you start arguing with that negative judging voice in your head?gt Well done you for continuing to break away from those voices of negativity. I can associate strongly with what you say here. It is exactly what I need to hear this afternoon. I just came back from therapy and we were talking about the worst case scenario of noone lending me money. It would be rough but youre right in thatThanks it took a long time to start arguing back with that negative voice. Im happy to help you develop that skill but recognize that the most important piece is that YOU start arguing back with that voice. The world wont end if you drop one ball. Ask me how I know  I have made so many mistakes this semester! Surprisingly the world has not imploded yet. gtand that the people who matter in my life will stand by me whatever happens.And thats the most important thing.gtThe amazing thing that came out of my session is that regardless of what happens with loans the chances of me not being able to support myself with writing jobs by July are very slim. Thats awesome!Im really glad to hear you have light at the end of the tunnel. Its hard sometimes when youre in the middle of a stressful slog to ever imagine it stops being so hard but it does. gtIf you dont mind I will keep you updated. Theres something cool about being able to be open about these things on the RBN subs. I find the group therapy aspect very helpful.I dont mind at all.

Your underlying frustration with the relationship is manifesting itself in your impatience with minor flaws.Can you encourage her to get out and do things other than hanging out with you?  Does she have any interests?   Could she volunteer somewhere?  If she could do these things but refuses then you have to take that into account when you consider how much you let her manipulate her into spending time with her.  Its not your fault that she refuses to build an independent existence and relies on you to be her only friend. My best friend is a bit of a challenging person at times but when she is being bossy or giving me advice I dont need I just smile and nod and do as I please.  We both know thats how she is but I love her and so most of the things she does wrong I just ignore or laugh off or maybe gently tell her to cut it out if necessary.

Even though they are sometimes aware of abuse they suffered and how bad it was they dont stop abusing others. My Nm was also abused beaten and treated like sh!t by her own father. She always talked about it loudly and how it was wrong. That did not prevent her from becoming a  covert narcissist cold and revenge inclined always wanting to control and to be the center of attention. The victimization she suffered made her narcissism even stronger. She knew that was wrong but she lost empathy and she tortured many family members with her mind games. It seems weird though.I often think about whole nations that suffered torture in the past and how they often become militant selfish and abusers of others.

4078243,0,t3_37ald6,Hey! It sounds as if you feel burdened to be your Moms counselorintermediate for your parents behaviour. Your parents are adults responsible for their own lives and happiness. They should not burden you with their problems those are theirs. Your parents can find support and guidance with their friendsfamilyhealth care providers. It is especially wrong if your parents put their marital issues onto the plates of their children. It would force you to meddle in someone elses relationship speak negatively about one of your parents. Your parents should be there to support YOU not the other way around!I sense in your post that you know how your family dynamics work which is great. Trust your instincts!! Lastly relationships are not   good actions to compensate  bad ones. If this is what you have learned what relationships are you were thought wrongly I am afraid. Relationships are about valueing eachothers contributions and helping eachother out because you want to. It is respecting eachothers boundaries keeping eachothers wishes in mind. Being able to be open and vulnerable and knowing that the other wont take adventage or disregard your feelings. If you mess up you apologize take responsibility and change. No need for big gestures to make it up.... ,raisedbynarcissists,crl58up,6,t5_2we9n
4080577,0,t3_379lto,I empathise with you so much. Losing a sister is hard. I lost my sister too. She disowned me while I was in the hospital recovering from an emergency csection via text. The things she said were so awful that I had a breakdown and the nurses had to take my baby away. I have been full N.C ever since.Every couple of months she texts me more abuse. The last text was this weekend on the day of my daughters first birthday party. Something about me ruining my daughters opportunity to have an aunt who loves her blah blah garbage. Some people have N tendencies and lowtolerance for stress. When traumatic events longterm stress over time etc become too much they can tip over the edge and become fullblown narcissists. I think this is what happened to my sister and could be what happened to yours. Internet hugs. Its tough when you dont see it coming. There is definitely something missing from this story that you dont know thitough. Either she always had this in her and has finally let it out or something happened to her. Perhaps the new family IS super toxic and manipulative. But I dont understand why your sister would turn like that if you had a healthy family otherwise. Did she have beef over old incodents or old trauma or anything? Either way theres no sense trying to make sense of it. Either people treat one another that way or they dont. Your sister infortunately is the kind of person who behaves like this. Nothing you can do but accept it and move on. ,raisedbynarcissists,crletlf,5,t5_2we9n

You press their paws just enough to make their claws come out while saying owwie or whatever you want to be your word  the trick is to put your fingers under the toes and apply slight pressure just enough that you can see their claws. He said this helps them understand that the problem more quickly and easily. Its uncomfortable nut not painful for them.

The question is where to go?  Ideally it would be great if you could rent an apartment with a friend or two to cut down on overall cost.  Its also a natural growing up step and isnt the drastic im leaving you situation. Could your grandparents loan you money or is there a lowinterest loan you can get from a bank?  Could you work part time while going to school or find a scholarshipgraduate assistantship? Ordinarily I wouldnt suggest going into debt at all but this is exactly the kind of situation to do it for  especially if you know youre going to recoup that money in the next couple years.  If it was me Id seriously sit down with a calculator and map out exactly how much it would cost to be on your own...and then figure out a way to make it happen.If none of that is an option then do your best to make yourself as scarce as possible.

I dont even know why I do it because I feel like crap afterwards. Its like looking at a car crash you know you shouldnt and yet you do anyway.The last time I looked she had posted something similar to what your mom posted only it was about my brother one of those repost if you love your son things. It was so sickeningly sweet and fake I literally got a stomachache. My brother was always the golden child with the exception of about  years where my Nmom repeatedly swore she hated his guts and would never talk to him again because he cut off contact with my parents when my dad was very sick with cancer and when my dad died he didnt call or come to the funeral. I guess hes back in the picture again and is back to being the golden child which just amazes me. Facebook is so full of fake bullsht.Sometimes I wish I were brave enough to start some sht on Facebook and speak the truth but then again why stoop to that level.

4179368,0,t3_38mhcw,Aside from the appalling way he is taking advantage of you financially I think you should leave.  Kids grow up and move out.  Thats what they are supposed to do.  I have grown sons and when they moved out on their own I didnt feel But Im still their mom so they should stay.  I was happy to see them take on adult life.  The fact that your dad isnt close to his family or doesnt have friends is not your problem.  This is the result of choices he has made and he is free at any time to make new choices.  You dont have to stay with him forever just so he is not lonely.  There are plenty of ways for him to be less lonely.  We dont rely on our children for that.If you do move out you might have to reduce your contact with him for a while  youre probably right that he would pressure you to come back.  But after a while you will be settled into your new life and he will figure out how to manage his and I think that pressure will be a lot less and you will still have a relationship with him.As a child you made a decision based on what was best for your dad not what was best for you.  That is sad but it doesnt have to continue.  You should set out on your adult life by going to college and staying with your mom or your friend until you can afford to live independently.

Shaming people for participating in those subs isnt something that going to be allowed in RBN. We dont just ban people without cause.

This is not something that I feel we can allow to happen again. I think its important for us to focus on the people in RBN that contribute positively to this space and work on supporting those users that are in need rather than rehashing this topic.

Where is your dad in all this?

If you have explained the family dynamic and the toxicity of it all and she simply says embrace them then she got her degree from a box of Cracker Jacks. As for the abuse you participate in I have been there. There have been times I have said horrible things to my mother out of anger and frustration and I have even laid hands on her. Despite her being totally black out drunk and not remembering it I still felt horribly awful about it because I was doing the same to her as she had done to me my whole life and NO ONE should be treated that way. My solution was to move out. I had to remove myself before I became a monster.

So lets say that happens lets say we move to SF  then what? Cost of living there is outrageous. We already ruled out a house if we want to have a good commute which we do. we could live outside the city I guess. But then we can move again later. Like if we both know we get up and change companies every  years tops then why lock ourselves down into a year mortgage? We wont make much progress chipping away at the interest by the time we go and if the housing market crashes well be underwater. Home ownership does not match our lifestyle  we need to be ready to move if one of us makes a big salary jump upward or downward. If we lose a job and we own a home in SF then that mortgage could turn into A Thing.For me I appreciate having public transit available. Some cities have that but with others I think house and I think suburb which doesnt always have much of anything.

He was an alcoholic most of my life got sober for a couple months..after delirium tremens and some really REALLY crazy shit..started drinking again when she died. Id just driven to their house and he was outside when I got out of my car. It was dark he was talking about how he wasnt there when she passed he was on his way to the nursing home and wanted to give her this little bird trinket thing she loved birds. That was how he showed love. He never verbalized it he didnt know how he would give random little gifts. But he didnt make it to her in time. He was crying drunk angry. And he just hugged me. I was sad for him but I felt weird too. Then I said something trying to comfort him but he got mad at me and stormed away.Idk...my mom has started trying more now. Gives me a hug when I leave after visiting sometimes. But it just feels weird..I cant feel happy about it you know?

It does not matter why or to what extent or for what reason someone gets upset  the normal human response to someone being upset is to try and do your best to stop engaging in the behavior that upsets that person.  It is irrelevant why or how much that person is upset by the behavior the normal human thing to do is to stop the behavior that upsets someone you care about regardless of your opinion of the matter.For her to keep insulting you about your weight an obviously upsetting thing anyways even from an objective standard she obviously does not care how you feel at all.  This is about her controlling you.  She gets a sick high of sorts by seeing that she can affect you.  I recommend avoiding her as much as possible and when she insults you reminding her that youve asked her to stop insulting you because it upsets you. When she says You are too sensitive you can rightfully respond Maybe so but that point is not relevant. Ive asked you to stop with these comments because they upset me.

She is a really great help for me in dealing with emotional regulation especially when being bombarded with words that can hurt us  such as namecalling criticism being triggered into selfhate and feeling responsible for things when they arent your fault.Your SOs father is not very tactful sounds pretty mean actually! and your SOs mother and early interventioner sound like they have a serious superiority complex.You just take one day at a time and tell yourself YOU KNOW that you are doing the best you can. AND NO ONE ELSE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY. You arent responsible for anyone else but yourself and every moment you are with your SO you know deep down she wants you to be there she likes you for you just being yourself not anything you do for her and her dad and mom feel impotent because of this. They are not responsible for her anymore because she is an adult and feel unease about it so they project it onto you. They are really just scared and they are really really stupid to think that yelling at an abuse victim like yourself is going to help them have control over your SO.Their anger at you is really them more afraid of loosing control of their daughter not any fear of you really. Next time they ever say those things about you just stay calm and see how they react if you agree with them fake it. Next time the dad says something mean to you just say you know you are right I am not the perfect boyfriend but your daughter likes to be with me because I dont yell at her and I treat her like an adult and friend. If you have a problem with me maybe we should sit down and talk about it seriously like adults...and I would be more than happy to address your worries about your daughters safety.

Hunt around for a nursing home that you think does an okay job and keep it in the back of your pocket.  If you have the time try volunteering at one or two. If you cant ask for tours of a few they do this for families who are shopping around all the time. Our plan for NMil is a government senior housing complex and then a decent nursing home. She absolutely refused to plan for her retirement and has no savings. We begged to her to start saving when she was in her early s and she refused.  Any solution that we have proposed for her is not nearly good enough.  Fine. Whatever. She found an apartment in a senior housing complex in the town where she lives. Its perfectly adequate.

Regardless we both know shes a wrong.I dont know any programmer that works minimum wage. If they do theyre doing it wrong. Minimum wage just means the employer doesnt value you and would pay you less if they could. Your time is worth something. Your knowledge and experience is worth something. When an employer stops valuing your time knowledge and experience especially when they arent keeping your compensation up with market rate its time to look for a better opportunity.BTW if you ever freelance make sure to have an ironclad contract for them to sign and include a Statement of Work SOW that outlines what work youll be doing taken up by X hours at Y ratehr. If they want to feature creep itll be a new or amended SOW with more time and money. When they stop paying dont be shy about sending them to collections or taking them to court if they start dragging out payment.

4363494,0,t1_cshbtm1,First keep any talk of divorce quiet from husband. Get your own bank account get a good job just act normal. Stop any complaints any suggestions just detach. Protect yourself. You will have to quietly move you and your son out one day while hubby is at work. It aint gonna be pretty because the N will go to war on you. My Nex was a pain during the divorce and typical N fashion made it all about how he was the victim amp ramped up his abusiveness to me Start hiding money in your private checking account different bank from his bank. Plan plan hide hide. Make copies of all bank records personal records of any financial dealings house papers you two have together. I stayed because I thought I could protect the kids better living with the N than if they were alone with him on visitation weekend. That meant I took the brunt of his crap and had to live with the abuse on me the abuse on my kid who was the SG just trying to be a good mom. Also had my head in the sand cause three kids is expensive to raise as a single parent no job. Was clueless on state mandated child support. Had to be the bad guy to break up the marriage when the last was in high school the SG and could choose to be at dads or not be at dads. It damaged me but I pulled through and this forum has helped alot. I dont know what to tell you because I am not sure I made the right choice to stay so long. If I had divorced him earlier would all the kids shun him now instead of me? Would they be really messed up? Except for being Ns the other kids all have decent jobs good lives etc. From reading the posts from teenagers it sounds to me like they never are old enough to thrive to detach to not accept the N abuse as their due when an N parent is heaping it on. The N  parent will tell the kid how bad you are you did this you are a bad mommy etc. when the separation happens. The kid will long for love from the parent who doesnt love them no matter how much love you give them. That is what happened to me. My last one home was in high school took him to a counselor who did him a world of good when the separation started. This last one is the only one who doesnt shun me and is not an N.  ,raisedbynarcissists,cshi0nq,1,t5_2we9n

Then if they dont transfer the car you can use that in court to get the money back.Do check it with a local lawyer before doing this. You want to get a good wording for the document and you want to know whether signatures are enough or if you need witnesses for example for it to be enforceable. If you were here I would say that this idea will work as long as your parents  the current owner of the car is working and making so much money that the debt to you can be extracted from hisher salary but there would be initial costs transferrable for them of course and a lot more drama involved with the court cases and waah waah my child is suing me tragicomedy.Not paying would mean much less hassle for you.,raisedbynarcissists,csks8yu,5,t5_2we9n

They offered up a bunch of what they were doing firstthen asked me to tell them what I was doing. I kept it general and brief. They kept sending me messages and I would reply with Sounds great or Keep up the good work!Eventually they stopped sending me messages. My guess is that they got tired of me not jumping in and giving them a bunch of info. Also I put a lot of info on my FB page so they probably have enough there to feed to my mom. Its all public though so Im very good at not oversharing on FB. I only put up stuff I wouldnt mind having in a newspaper. In any case my mom doesnt have a whole lot of control of her crazy family and Im not interested in being in touch with them so I only got a couple flying monkeys.

But no school clothes for me for years. No food in the house except a bag of rice. I remember being in my psychology class ironically after lunch period. At this point I hadnt eaten in a couple days. I was starving couldnt see straight. Searing headache. Some rich kids come in and they throw away a full container of sushi right in front of me. It took all my will power to not reach in and devour the food like an animal. Instead I put my head down an cried. The teacher takes me out of the room to some place private and asks if Im ok. I tell her Im just so hungry. I cant even see straight. So she takes me to the cafeteria and gets me lunch and sets up meal tickets. I tell them I have a sister too that needs help. That night I got one of the worst verbal attacks from my nm. How dare you embarrass me like that! The school called and said you werent being fed. Do you know how that makes me look! You dont deserve food. You dont deserve life. I wish I aborted you!  I just laughed in her face. It was the beginning of the end. Maybe  months later she moved across country without warning and left me homeless. Im sorry you went hungry growing up. I wish no one knew the pain of starving.

4446225,0,t1_csqmic3,You may want to look for something like krav maga or a one on one class which specializes in real life situations.  I have a mentally ill disturbed neighbor who has menaced and assaulted me.  Self defense helped a lot.  First I was able to keep her back a bit which meant the punches to my head werent as bad as they would have been otherwise.  And the fact that I fought back seems to have surprised her and her mother.  I dont think they expected that.  And the fact that she got arrested for the assault helped.  Also as I said in another response get surveillance cameras.  The only the reason the police arrested my neighbor was because I had one in the stairwell where she charged up at me and that proved they were up by my apartment the only thing on that floor they had no other reason to be up there.  There had been previous incidents with her blocking my path and menacing me but no proof other than another neighbor witnessing an incident.  And get to know the people in your local police department.  Talk to them about safety plans.

Everything in our price range was a split level or raised ranch.My dad is very handy and my brother is a contractor so I asked them to come look at a house we were considering.  Mom came along for the ride and pointed out everything that was small about the small house.  Duh.Then she said Ive read youre never supposed to put the bedrooms over the garage in case of carbon monoxide fumes. This is her MO  she always refers to some other authority or person with experience its not her opinion shes just sharing.  My brother looked at her crosseyed.Thanks mom for predicting the death of our children in our new house!  Youre a honey so glad you came along.  Like we would ever even run a car in the garage I guess we are just so stupid and would you like to give us all the money in the world so we can buy a much larger house with acreage that supported a detached garage?That was the last time she looked at houses with us.  ,raisedbynarcissists,csr7doo,8,t5_2we9n

Yes CPS will get involved but thats what you want.  You want them to make a report on your situation.  I doubt they will take you from the home or anything dont panic about that.  What they will probably do is force the family to go into therapy which means that youll get ongoing protection from your crazy Mom.Also as a childyou are under  you are technically a childshe cant legally kick you out of the house.

What shes done is committed one crimethe felony assaultand nearly committed anotherthe child abandonment of kicking you out of the house. IANAL but I believe that if you play your cards right and tell all this to your school youll get control of your life far faster than you can expect she wont dare go to jail over this and thats the power youll have to stop her from acting up again.

That usually shuts them right up. Its also all true. If as I suspect my mom diddoes suffer from the same mental illness Ive been diagnosed with then holy shit it sucks. I dont wish it on anyone.

But NOT appropriate to become hysterical full of righteous anger or some other strong reaction that he wont know how to manage. Pretend that you are a mirror of his face. If hes sad be sad for him but dont be MORE sad than he is. If hes angry use supportive words and remember that for ACONs its very important to get reinforcement and reassurance No that was NOT irresponsible of you yes you were right about that. No thats not normal behavior and her reaction is not your fault etc and let him know that you feel angry on his behalf but remember not MORE angry than he does.

4631387,0,t1_cte7ne7,Your comment made me remember and understand an episode of my childhood. One more element that proves how fucked up my parents are especially my mom who always tries to pass herself as the victim. When nDad abandoned us paying little to no child support she would say that I should be grateful that she didnt put me in an orphanage because thats what every single mother would do. Since we lived in a small town in a very catholic and conservative area there werent many divorces or single parents around so I couldnt compare and I really believed what she said and was very happy to have this extraordinary mom who would not abandon me even when any other mother would have done that even if I was such a horrible child. But another part of me couldnt stand her. She used to say it is worse to have just you than to take care of  children like my mother did. What? I was the best in school polite I saved all the money I got for christmas or my birthday from relatives. And most importantly I was born in this situation. Its not my fault. She on the other hand chose to marry my gambling irresponsible verbally abusive narcissistic pathologically lying father. And to quit her job because of course when you have such a reliable man to take care of you why being financially independent? But in her view she is a poor victim and I am guilty.

You should do the career Ive been doingwhining about for the last  years  instead. Ive spent the last  years trying to find a career which utilizes my strengths challenges me makes a difference in the world and will bring me a satisfying long term career. I have spent a long time searching for a path and I have found it. I am grateful to have a great SO who is extremely supportive and believes in me. Right now I am working my absolute butt off to get towards my goal. I have two weeks before the deadline of this last prerequisite course and am on a very tight timeline. In the past week my mother has recommended that I take a day off! You cant study all the time if you feel like chatting with us well be downstairs after I had spent the last  hours doing familystuff with my grandma the night before a big exam. Any other time yes I know I can take a day off and yes I know youd rather have me downstairs so you can idly talk at me rather than studying but I am on a tight schedule to do well and Ive already sacrificed a lot of my day to spend with family. Based on previous statements about my choices it is easy to piece together than while her words are presented as warm kind thoughts they are actually subtle ways of trying to sabotage my success and acts of manipulation. Anyways just got my mark back from my precalculus exam written yesterday . My previous exam marks in that course which I have taught to myself have been  and . The previous two courses I have taught myself have been biology  finished with  and physics  . This is the first time I have ever truly pursued something that I know would be challenging and it is extremely satisfying to know that I can achieve what I put my mind to in spite of my Nmoms disapproval.

Things would be fine and then Nsis would snap and then everyone would melt down a little bit again.  Shed been promising a toy to one of the boys for awhile so we went to the store and there were continued mini meltdowns but nothing so bad.Until we got to the register when he saw the candy and asked for something else.  My sister had a quiet rage put the toy back and pushed everyone out of the door.  The kids were justifiably wailing in despair they had really been doing the best they could and I was utterly stunned and helpless.  The screaming and raging got worse and a store attendant actually came over to make sure Nsis had not hit them no never physical abuse though if it had been enough to make her get in trouble over it Id have felt better.I didnt know my sister was an N at the time but I was beginning to realize her behavior was beyond normal selfishness and rudeness.  I still cry sometimes remembering that day and how helpless my darling nephews were.  They probably dont even remember.

In retrospect it probably seemed as though I was being far too unfair about him being allowed to go to a friends but we were surprising him with a trip to the beach in a few minutes so he couldnt go over! My Fleas Gma LOST IT. You shouldnt let him disrespect you! Hell grow up and disrespect everyone!. I explained to her and even showed her shortly after that that when Kiddo is angry with us as parents we all sit down discuss what happened discuss why he was upset and remind him that if hes upset he doesnt need to shout or use rude gestures as appropriate as they may seem at the time and that he can always come and talk to us if hes not happy with a decision weve made. We reminded him that we werent angry or upset with him for telling us he wasnt happy with our decision but that rude gestures and shouting arent the best or easiest way to get your way and that discussing things with us will almost always lead to a better understanding of whats going on and why weve said what weve said. Kiddo hugged us apologized for his actions and he reminded us that even if he gets angry or shouts he still loves us too.Fleas Grandma and I talked afterwards and I told her I was never allowed to be angry with my parents  and my parents did some pretty shitty things. It really messed me up in life and made me feel like I could never voice my opinion if I didnt agree and it never really taught me decent conflict resolution. This way Kiddo will learn how to handle conflict and will be able to carry that skill on into his friendships his marriage his workplace and everywhere else in his life. It might seem disrespectful to let him shout or make rude gestures but raising a kid is a process  and shouting is much MUCH better than the hitting he was wanting to do  years ago or the throwing things he was wanting to do  years ago.

4787393,0,t3_3ggmr5,I have been with my SO for years and its only now that I am able to very easily accept his love!!For years we had problems and even in our first year of marriage we were having problems that should NOT have been problems. I had a hard time recognizing what they were because I had FLEAS. After recognizing the fact I was RBN and I had FLEAS I was able to really turn around and work through the issues! I still am but its amazing how much better our relationship has become!Im not entirely sure what kind of issues you have in your relationship. For me it was that I had a hard time accepting any kind of comment my husband made. Even if he made a suggestion that was good for me like looking after myself healthwise it triggered my defensive fighting system that I used to try and stop my Nmom manipulating me which made our fights escalate into an unnecessary level. I took everything he said as a personal attack with hidden meaning.  I couldnt accept that there were things he said because he honestly loved me and it wasnt to manipulate me or control me. That was my problem that trickled to all other aspects too. Now I am better at recognizing it although I need to do better. But my wonderful husband has been nothing but patient! You will be ok! It takes sometime but every little change adds up and makes things better! Just keep moving in the direction of being self aware and communicate with your fiancee! Make sure both of you take the journey together! ,raisedbynarcissists,ctxznfv,2,t5_2we9n

4879140,0,t3_3hojy7,I think that working this out with a therapist is best  as isolated incidents they dont seem horrible to me at all and are things that could have easily happened in my home right now with my son and Iie. He could stumble into our room to sleep with us when theres something ahem perhaps not child friendly on the TV. Were very open about nudity so my kiddo saying that girl should have a shirt probably would have me asking him why? theyre just boobs  especially if it wasnt porn and was just a music video or something.When Kiddo was younger we used to shower together but it stopped when he was probably ? Hes  and still needs help bathing and either his Dad or I help him interchangeably.Kiddo has asked about puberty and differences in women and men and although I probably wouldnt have demanded he show me or have pushed him to something he was uncomfortable with I probably would have reminded him that he asked the question and wanted an answer again though were a fairly nude family to begin with  I dont want him to feel ashamed to be naked the way I did as a kidteenyoung adult.I havent ever had kiddo walk on my spine but he does his Dads walking on it or karate chopping it. He thinks its fun and its never something that hes forced into.If my kiddo was in a concert and was worried or upset Id be the first parent back there despite his protestations because I want to take care of him and help him calm down before the performance even if hes worried what the other kids might think.Now all of that said the other items youve mentioned are concerning esp the one where youre convinced youve soiled yourself and if your dad HAS been found guilty of actually molesting someones and its something that happened in your family then I think that you need to dig deeper to find it. Like others have said I think its important to explore why you think the other things might have been signs of abuse  if there was something about it that makes you extra uncomfortable its possible that something happened before or after and youre tagging those feelings onto the benign memory.I was sexually abused briefly as a wee kiddo and cant remember any of it. I can remember the event and in my memory its like yours are  not anything anyone could find any issue with but when I remember the events theres this feeling of unease surrounding them taking a bath with an older samesex cousin.

4900772,0,t3_3i06cs,I experience something like this too and I guess I use a mixed cognitive and emotional approach to get past the overwhelms and stay connected to people. Overall I see it as choosing to be a nurturing parent to the damaged child within. Emotional I meditate every day which is good for helping me manage my anxiety and stay somewhat centred. While meditating I imagine myself to be in contact with the person in question like facing each other in the same room or holding their hands and connect to the feelings involved. Sometimes I imagine Im telling them what Im feeling if I can put it into words. It was hard to do this at first because AAAAAGH FEELINGS but it didnt take long to realise that the feelings will pass and I will be okay. The important thing is just to face the feelings and acknowledge them rather than to get into a debate with them.Cognitive I do this either in writing or talking out loud to myself. I validate my feelings and tell myself its okay to have them and explore why I have such and such a feeling about this or why it feels so intense. This is about trying to explain my reaction to whats going on between me and other people so I can make peace with my feelings and move on. I often have to remind myself that past experiences have affected how I react to current events and thats why my reactions are sometimes screwy or exaggerated.Im not saying Im  reliable because thats just not true. However I am doing a lot better at staying connected with people and keeping relationships going. Sometimes I need to withdraw for a little while to work through the feelings and sometimes I need to pull back a bit for a week or two while I recover my balance. If Im not up to dealing with people I try to cancel plans by text message rather than just flake out on them  there are some people I can be honest with about having a bad time but for others I just make a plausible excuse such as having a migraine or being tired. If I want or need to deal with someone but need to make sure it doesnt get too intense for me I try to set up the situation in my favour for example making it into a group thing or meeting somewhere public.Try to remember that nobody is perfect and everyone is unreliable sometimes. Most people so long as theyve not come from a crazy family with extreme expectations or have some kind of disorder understand and accept that shit happens sometimes. So long as you are courteous enough to let people know you have to let them down rather than just disappearing decent and functional people will usually continue to be willing to deal with you. And sometimes you can repair the relationships that have been affected by the overwhelms. For example if the woman from the clinic was considerate enough to be concerned about overwhelming you there is a good chance she would be receptive to you saying Im sorry I avoided you. You were right and I did get overwhelmed. I like you and would like to spend time with you if we set some boundaries on what we talk about so that I dont get overwhelmed again. ,raisedbynarcissists,cuca4cg,6,t5_2we9n

You need to go before the Heavenly Father and supplicate for mercy  you need to feel genuine remorse the kind that drives you to do anything to make it right with God. That remorseful feeling and deep desire to reconcile with Him is what unlocks the forgiveness Jesus provides us with if I may paraphrase.This interpretation is coming from a fundie Baptistsuper conservative paradigm  we simply dont see sufficient evidence in the Bible to say that God is love and that salvation is either inherent or irrevocable. Idk if it lends any credence but Im in Bible college and I evangelize as well as write apologetic papers for my other philosophy program.But yeah basically...

4987625,0,t3_3j46ov,The Narcanimal connection is pretty funny isnt it!?! Not the same situation but my NMom is very jealous of my relationship with a cat we adopted when I was . We rescued her from the druggie neighbors next door who had waaay too many animals. Basically the coke head dad would beat the ever living shit out of his kids and then find  possibly steal animals to bring home as an apology. The kids not really their fault as they were projecting would in turn abuse the animals. One day I caught them throwing the cat at their chained up German Shepard whos food bowl was just out of reach. Needless to say  kitty would flea to our house for safety. Eventually she got preggers so NMom took her in adopted out the kittens and she lived with us inside. BUT we already had  cats that HATED kitty because she took on the dominate role as the  enforcer and anytime the other cats were misbehaving  peeing on the carpet she run over to bitch slap them. The cat wars raged on as I left for college. Once I stared to rent an apartment I asked to help and take kitty in. NMom wanted the help but didnt want me to take kitty as she was clearly her favorite. But since apartments dont like cats pissing all over the only viable option was to take kitty. Begrudgingly she allowed me to.Its been  years and anytime NMom comes to visit kitty hides runs from her. This is likely because I unlike NMom dont believe in forcing affection on animals  abused or not and I rarely pick her up NMom always did and she HATES being picked up because of her past abuse. I let her do what she wants outside of jumping on tables and scratching couches. But NMom knows animals and kitty just doesnt know that she wants affection... Eye roll. Seriously when I was a kid shed hold her down and force her to stay on her lap and snuggle her as payment for shelter and food as NMom said She needed to earn her keepNow NMom describes her as a diva kitty that thinks shes so fancy living in a college town apartment and is  took good for us now Jesus mom project much?,raisedbynarcissists,cun6zay,1,t5_2we9n

4997349,0,t1_cuocc97,Actually it does! A gift isnt a transaction either. Once its given thats it and Im guessing before the gifting she referred to it only as a gift and not as something shed hold over your head in the future.From here you just need to reiterate how you understand her frustrations but any sort of future repayment of a gift needs to be in the form of a signed contract if its to hold any real weight. If she complains ask her point blank if it was a gift.Eventually shell try to find a dumb lawyer to prove this or that but without a formal agreement or a signed contract BEFORE said free item its a gift.Then youll get the flying monkeys all you need to tell them is that youre paying it forward not backwards all efforts are going towards making the world a better place not improving the life of one individual who doesnt deserve it.Last thing you need to develop the strength of character to realize the validity of your definitions gift and child rearing.

When something happens between us she usually acts like it didnt happen ESPECIALLY if she was at fault.  Ex.  Mom and I were at a buffet one time. She aks for a bite a food takes a huge bite and I tell her she takes a huge nite. She starts crying in the middle of a crowded buffet screaming about how ungrateful and rude and mean I am to her. We leave a few minutes later get back to the hotel....and everything is fine. She acted like that scene at the buffet hours ago never happened and is back to being happy was creepy.I think its a form of gas lighting. Shes trying to pretend there was never a problem between you to instill doubt and make you feel out of control. She also may be gaslighting herself. Ns believe they are perfect and can never do wrong.

Or you told them and they chose not to believe you. That makes them at least partly culpable. Its natural that the loss of your family of origin hurts. Give yourself time and permission to grieve. Grief hurts but it doesnt last forever and its how we deal with loss and eventually move on.You have friends you have your own placefocus on that. Invest time and emotion into your family of choice. Tell your family of origin that the door is open and then try to be at peace which whatever choice they make.

5028682,0,t3_3jsunj,There have been some excellent post on forgiveness here.  Heres one discussion started by JohnDaker  Latenerd shared a link to this blog post about what forgiveness is and how you cant really forgive someone who has never taken responsibility for the hurt they perpetrate on you and its not fair to be expected to  Invahs comment to that thread is also excellent and is stored at RBNs best of threadThat said I think its probably a lot more important for your own healing to acknowledge and grieve what your family hasnt been able to be for you and take action to protect yourself from further abuse.  Part of the grieving process is anger.  I cant speak for anyone else but when I finally separated myself and woke up to how abusive my nmother had been I was royally pissed for a good long time.  Suppressing that anger isnt healthy.  Youve been suppressing it for years and its gotten you nowhere healthy.  Truly the only way to the other side is through not around.  Youll need your therapists help to not take out your anger in unhealthy ways but feeling that anger and understanding it is part of eventually letting it go and being done with it.  It took you years to get to this point.  Youve got a lot to be angry about.  Its going to take you a while to feel the anger you need to feel before it is time to let it go.  Sure eventually you want to be at a stage where you can balance your anger with compassion for yourself and others but you dont have to rush it to satisfy anyone else other than yourself.  And finally Im really sorry you had to go through all of that.  Id imagine it was hard enough to go through a traumatic experience like trying to resuscitate your stepfather much less how nasty your family has been.  So welcome. There are a lot of resources on the right column of this subreddit that talk about how to recognize abusive behavior and ways of protecting yourself   And RBNBestOf has discussions and comments that were submitted as being particularly helpful.,raisedbynarcissists,cus5bu4,3,t5_2we9n

It really depends on how often your sons been around adults and how much exposure hes had to news or other sources of information.

Its nothing about you you didnt cause his illness but its best for both of you that he stay away. Of course you might want to talk to your sons therapist about this beforehand but not addressing his fathers absence might only increase the allure of his father and make your son want to see him more and foment resentment towards you if he cant worst would be that your son begins siding with his father and pushes you away when hes at that hating parents and blaming them for everything stage.

5098750,0,t1_cv04cd4,My mom recently started cleaning out her house. The logical step would be to throw away stuff that is obviously trash and take the salvageable things you dont want to Goodwill or somewhere. Not my mom. She started texting me every time she came across any item and asking if I wanted it. Total junk sometimes even literal trash. Id have to tell her at least  times that I wasnt interested. Its not even like it was cherished stuff from my childhood...it was shit thats accumulated in her house most of which I either didnt remember or had never seen before. When she tried to get me to take an old Easter decoration off her hands I had to have a come to Jesus talk with her because shed found it in her attic and the cellophane window on the packaging was FUCKING GREEN. Like mold green. Her excuse for not trashing it? But the Easter eggs are hand painted. The damn demon tree that Hexxus lived in was hand painted too you crazy loon and look what happened there! I told her just to throw it out and she said No Ill have the kidney foundation come get it. The decoration is still in good shape! Its not. Her final point was people buy stuff like this all the time! and I just texted back people throw shit like that away all the time too! I didnt hear from her for the rest of the day haha. After a few weeks of this I told her to just email me about stuff rather than sending me eight thousand text messages a day. Simple solution that still helps her feel like shes not getting rid of crappy junk I dont want. What does she do?

5144638,0,t3_3lglxd,You are not wrong. It doesnt matter if you were working  hours a week or  hours. If you feel overburden than you feel overburden. How much work that means is different for all of us. Some people can go  hours a week working and not feel anything most people cannot. MOST PEOPLE would have a hard time with a schedule as hectic as yours not having a day off to unwind is very difficult ESPECIALLy if your job is a service type job. Those jobs can be very exhausting. Do ask about changing your scheduled dont be apologetic this is what you need. If they like you and youre a decent worker and they arent horrible people they will accommodate your schedule. Training someone new is more expensive than just working around your schedule. Youre a University student most jobs know College kids schedules change its what they should expect. The only problem area could be the job markets is ridiculous and its easier to find new hires. That doesnt mean they wont work around you scheduled but if your needs dont match up they could potentially reduce your hours or let you go entirely. This is a possibility but again its cheaper for them to work with you than hire a new person. Your parents just do want most Narcs do criticize critique complain their advice is always going to be towards the worst possible scenario. Which can be helpful in someway they will let you know what could potentially go wrong BUT that doesnt mean what they are saying is even remotely true. Its just one possible scenario the most negative in a mix of possible scenarios. It sounds like you need a break and you need to sort out how to make that happen. If you do get fired or something doesnt work out. THAT IS OKAY! Things like that happen. You werent getting what you need from your job and your job wasnt getting what it needs. It was a mutual decision. Just get a new one that fits your schedule. May I suggest babysitting or housecleaning. these positions are way more flexible.

Partly because I think she was jealous I was getting experiences she didnt get to have in school and finding things I was good at. Shed also get really uppity about picking me up from play practices or Forensics meets both of which I did really well in. When I finally quit choir at  it was because my mother constantly threw fits about having to drive me to my graded concerts across town from our house twice a semester. Shed either drop me off and not attend or go and watch and bitch about having to sit through it even if I had solos. Once she dropped me off then came to pull me out of the concert partway through. It was embarrassing as hell and she had no reason she just said she didnt want to come pick me up later and she didnt want to deal with my siblings so I had to take care of them so she could sit in her room alone.I think it sounds like your mom was manipulating you into quitting.

5183734,0,t1_cvaqhim,I wouldnt say it was a ritual exactly. It wasnt formally taught. But the list of things that were punishable was so long that spanking was basically a daily occurrence. One time in particular it was summer and the pastors wife decided the kids at her house should play with the garden hose. The water was very cold and her oldest son and myself didnt want to get wet. We both got spanked for that. I dont remember why exactly but it could easily have been either not being tough enough to brave the cold water or just not participating in the Mandatory Fun Time.Im still a Christian actually but of a very different stripe than what I was raised in. And one of the things Ive learned is that prooftexting is a bad idea. In context the rod in the Bible is a shepherding image. The rod was a long pole used to guide sheep but it was not used to beat sheep. A shepherd who beat his sheep was regarded as a bad and ineffective shepherd. By implication the use of shepherding as a metaphor for parenting indicates that the more physical force a parent used the less effective they were as parents. The rod represents discipline in the sense of guidance but does not in any way prescribe hitting kids.After I learned that I tried bringing it up a couple of times.

Cyber hug and be proud of your achievements  own them. You are ABSOLUTELY doing the right thing in fact  I would suggest NC. Not only will he hound you but he may also show up at your home or work you may have to advise your manager also perhaps double check the security on your cards and bank accounts make sure they have NO access or parental right a bank manager can walk you through this It happened to me at ...my parents attempted to access my savings account and also attempted to take out a k student loan in my name.Your NDad is most likely going to attempt several tactics FOG.Fear Obligation and Guilt. He will most likely swing between the three and he may also attempt to Buy your affection  a random card present or emotional statement on Facebook.But now you know there is an agenda. You are working and studying and budgeting  and yet you are supposed to give this ADULT spending money  because he is irresponsible with his own income? You will go without so he can purchase something he wont disclose? No logical person would lend someone in these circumstances their debit card? Pretend hes not your father...would you do it for someone else with a history of self absorbed erratic and irresponsible behaviour? The fact he is your father simply makes it worse.NParents see their children as Bank Accounts.They see their children as an asset.Nparents have a skewered view that their children which they chose to have and raise owe them for this miraculous gift of life. Seriously impregnating someone is not an amazing feat standing ovationLook up the youtube of comedian Chris Rock and Parenting!Now  every once in a while things go wrong  and you reach out to family and friends you borrow FOR SERIOUS NEEDS! and you pay them back you are humble and grateful. A Narcissist will justify sending their children broke Oh youre young you can work I cant. I raised you. I sacrificed my youth for you. Look at everything Ive done for you. Your Ndad believes he has a natural entitlement to your money.Narcissists never pay people back and Nparents feel no remorse for putting their children in debt.You are the Childalbeit a grown one He is the ADULT and a Parent.

5235556,0,t3_3mnz1l,Im just going to address the two things that stuck out to me in your story so if any of this is offbase due to details you didnt include feel free to ignore. I think you have two slightly separate problems  your current pain during sex and your mothers abuse screwing up your sex life. As far as the pain goes I agree with the commenter below that you should seek medical help for that. In the meantime you should have a VERY frank discussion with your current partner who may not realize or understand how much pain hes causing you. Youll probably have to spend a little time soothing him because hes going to feel like an asshole for not realizing it before. Not to sound like an s safe sex pamphlet but there are a whole lot of things you can do even as a hetero pairing that dont require PIV intercourse. Toys can be really helpful in keeping everyone happy and satisfied. On the other side of the equation Im not sure you should pursue a relationship with a woman until you get some pretty intense therapy to work through your mothers abuse. Its very very common for people who have been abused to fall intensely in lovelust with people who remind them of their abuser in an unconscious attempt to fix that abusive relationship through the new person. Because your abuser and the people youre attracted to are the same sex IMO that makes your subconscious even more likely to jump up and sabotage you. So I would be very careful about getting involved with a woman until you deal with your feelings about your abusive mother in therapy so you dont emotionally hurt yourself or anyone you get involved with.If you really think the relationship with your current boyfriend has run its course and its not just because of the painful sex which could very well be painful with a samesex partner too! then the kindest thing to do is break up so he can find someone else but I wouldnt jump into a new relationship without a lot of therapy to help you separate your feelings about your mother from your feelings about any potential women you might date in the future. It can be done but you need to do the work and be very aware of when youre subconsciously casting your partner in the role of your parent. Good luck!,raisedbynarcissists,cvh2pa1,3,t5_2we9n

5245775,0,t3_3mt6vz,I think it depends on the therapist and your issues.  I just started therapy again.  The first therapist I tried recommended by work health insurnace was just fucking awful.  She gave me an online quiz in a session to determine if I was bipolar.  And then told me on the results that I should go talk to a professional.  WTF?Anyway been in the nd one for about  weeks.  she is much better.  Not an expert in Nissues but knows her stuff.  I have several friends that teach psychology at university level and they recommended that I interview therapists over the phone before paying.  Asking their experience and style.  They also said try to get someone with a PHD vs MSW.   The MSW are good for shit like everyday anxiety but N related issues need a real background. Honestly though meditating has helped me far more than the therapist at least with my symptoms.  Good luck!  ,raisedbynarcissists,cviazjr,1,t5_2we9n

What you wrote really rings true and even just sitting here reading it being interested and agreeing with it I come to the line so your reaction is out of place and immediately feel that first twinge of reactivity.I feel like a scientist writing observations about some unexplained phenomenon right now. I can feel that alarm very quietly going off some tightening in my chest shoulders pulling in.. almost unnoticeable like the tip of a cats tail twitching  youd have no idea it meant anything if you didnt know how to read it.Its fascinating. And being so aware of it as the subject of the discussion at hand Im simultaneously experiencing this reaction without feeding into it or trusting it as truth. I think it might be mistaken for a gut feeling a lot like theres a big similarity in how Im reading my body right now.. which off in the real world when youre not specifically looking for it could make it very hard to detect and choose not to follow. It can be so harmful to follow what you think is a gut feeling when its actually more like an allergic reaction... its a defense mechanism that our bodies and minds developed to protect us in a specific type of harmful situation thats the most understandable way I can think to name this. Like peanuts on their own arent deadly to the majority of people but some peoples immune systems or whatever it is I dont know the tech of how allergies work P they just sound the alarm any time even a tiny trace of peanuts appears in the body and it seems like they will selfdestruct before allowing the peanut to remain there. For CoNP invalidation could be like a peanut.I cant see how to continue that line of thought but the silliness of that sentence made me giggle and I noticed a lot of that hovering tension kind of melted away suddenly. Like theres only room in your mind for a red alert or a lol and not both.. once I let myself find humor in something theres no way to keep up the tension and drama of the moment.

For example I feel under constant stress at home. and I feel like I cant be a whole person when at home. You father may try to gaslight during therapy but a good therapist will frown upon Youre wrong. You dont feel X and Y.If he starts to deny things happened stick to it. Regardless when event X happened it made me feel Y. Your feelings are never wrong. Your feelings are valid.Its not legal court. You dont have to build a case. You dont have to prove abuse for it to have happened. A good therapist is not going to choose sides but will help you and your father communicate better with each other.Also stop discussing therapy with your father and mother until the appointment. Change the subject when you father brings it up or mention youd like to talk about that in therapy. Or say something like Good point. Lets bring that up in therapy.ETA I see you got the exact opposite advice from uDeadLittleSister. Stick to the facts VS stick to your feelings It may be confusing but I can see how both plans could work. Youll have to find out what you are most comfortable with. Your father gets something out of enabling. Youre asking him to give up on that something and that wont come easy. He wants to use therapy to get you to yield to abuse.

If my parents did such thing to me I would confront them would not listen to them denying it ever happening and threaten to lock them up in a mental hospital preferably in a third world country as UK hospitals probably have really nice facilities or to report them for abuse I doubt there is a time limit for it could also sue them for spoiling your childhood and causing you a mental trauma.

I also was never allowed to learn to drive. I am just now at  getting driving lessons where the instructor will pick me up and drop me off anywhere. They never let me work enough to break free. Balancing school and work is already hard by itself. Its worse when your family is breathing down your neck. I suggest using that money you have to get driving lessons and the cheapest car you can find assuming they wont let you drive theirs.  I know there is a huge push to go straight to college after high school but I really wished I had of taken a couple years to make as much money as I could so I cold free myself from my family.You can always transfer to your dream school from the community college and you would have save money. Get good grades and you will be able to get scholarships. Also schools cant tell them if youre enrolled what classes youre taking or youre grades. Schools also have on campus jobs you could do on the down low. You may need to fill out a FAFSA and since your parents will probably claim you until youre  you will not be able to apply independently. They will have to be the ones filling it out because it will ask for all their info. I could never get mine to do it so good luck.The school I go to also has a bus stop so I manage to pick up hours at work sometimes and just take the bus there and and back. I make up reasons like working on a group project to explain the extra time. I went to community college right after high school like my family wanted. I figured it would still lead to getting a job that would allow me to break free. Then I let them bully me into switching my majors every few semesters. When I first started going they wanted me in computer programming because thats where the jobs were. Almost done that and they wanted me to switch to networking almost done that and IT is oversaturated and Im waisting their money generosity and all they do for me go to school for accounting... same thing. By the time I wised up and realized how horrible they were I had amassed enough credits for a bachelors but I have no degree little work experience  and Im not getting any younger.

I think the scariest part is that looking at her today shes just worlds away from what she was and when she sort of acknowledged that I was floored. I do often wonder if she will ever return to that state... Youre right about her being sadistic. She likes to play by doing things to hurt people like my dad sometimes my brother... I wont allow her to touch me like that... Then Ive never felt entirely comfy letting her touch me anyway such as pressing her thumbnail at the base of their fingernails or pinching the back of someones arm... She laughs like its genuinely funny. Once she was angry at my dad and told me she could kill him a certain way that no one would find out. I joked that I would have to turn her in and she said back that if she thought I would snitch Id be going the same way as him. Funny. But not. On the other hand I just become conflicted. We just came back from a vacation she took me on as an early Christmas gift. It was just the two of us and it was so fun. Apart from her throwing the amount she spent in my face a few times and getting annoyed once because I didnt want to get on certain rides at the park we had a really great time.

5414625,0,t1_cw3rep2,No worries its the least I can do for someone in need.I have a feeling you need to have a talk with your boyfriend. Issues tend to get worse with time. A good outcome that I can see happening is that he ensures that he does love you and you two talk about the whole sex issue. About how you dont enjoy it. Come to a compromise for example cuddling. For all you know he may not even care about sex enough to make a mandatory thing in your relationship. An okay one would be he explains how he feels so do you and you end the relationship on a good note. You can work out some living arrangements with him until you can get yourself back on your feet. I highly doubt anything worse than this will happen and I hope it doesnt. And for your family Id say get away from them. Cut off all connections to an extent. If it were me Id cut off all connections with people who wouldnt help me or didnt want to get in the middle of things. Hell my dad found out his childhood friend that he kept in contact with was homeless and offered him a place to stay and a car to borrow so he can get himself back on his feet. He starts his second job on Thursday and is saving money up for an apartment and his own car. If people can do things like this for friends then family can do this for family. Someone not willing to help you is not worth keeping in your life except those that fear for their own safety. Id really like to help you. Please keep in touch. Im also low on fuel so please forgive any errors or nonesense. ,raisedbynarcissists,cw3rzi6,3,t5_2we9n

Most campuses have free counselling for students. Son takes meds hes done some therapy but doesnt have much in the way of past trauma to process so mostly that helped him with some coping strategies.  Sometimes he calls or texts us if he needs someone to listenhelp him calm down.

About putting one foot in front of the other. About finding goals and inspiration that motivates you to keep on living and looking forward instead of backwards. Little things like allowing yourself a simple treat that you were taught to feel guilty or unworthy of ice cream a new shirt reading a favorite book. Learning how to love and be loved. Learning how to love yourself. To me throwing yourself at life means giving yourself permission to heal to do the work. To search for the things that can and will make you happy feel safe and like there is a reason to keep on living. Today I gave myself a pat on the back. I actually reached over my shoulder and gave myself a pat. Because I bought a birthday present for my husband.

5500296,0,t3_3qeatt,I had a high school boyfriend we were each others first love.  Our Nparents made up break up after a year because they thought it was too serious even though we vowed not to have sex.  Biggest regret is not having had sex with him!  Would have been a much better first experience not that I believe in the social construct of virginity.  That forced breakup sent me into an emotional tailspin and I lost so much weight couldnt eat or sleep and was completely not myself for a whole year.  He ended up going to psych ward after suicide attempt and then moving across the country to his biodad.

5509623,0,t3_3qk3h3,I am in the same place right now. I am facing some great personal challenges that need my focus and energy but cannot seem to move out of this stuck place I am in. It is a subject I woke up thinking about this morning.We didnt choose to grow up with the circumstances we did. We didnt ask to be damaged the way we were by the Ns in our lives. We didnt choose to live with the aftereffects of all of that for the rest of our lives. We can choose how we deal with it. First option Sit and dwell in the justifiable anger we feel. This works only for awhile. Dwelling has the positive effect of letting us process emotions. The downside is that it is very easy to get stuck in this place. It is like a quicksand that thickens the longer you sit in it. It sucks you in and wont let go. Second option Dont think about our past and try to move forward in whatever way we can. This only works for awhile. Our pasts are an integral part of our lives. We cannot escape the damage and aftereffects of the damage done. When you try to ignore the elephant in the room the elephant will come charging out of the shadows at the worst time possible. You are left a broken pile because your emotions become a raw raging mess. Third option Make the conscious choice to move forward and start letting go. There is no way we can undo what was done. The past is the past. But dwelling in the past stops us from enjoying the now and what will be in the future. Start with a conscious decision to move forward in one aspect of your life. Like take up meditation go out for coffee with a friend once a week take up a new hobby. For those brief periods of time dont let the past crop up. Then give yourself time each day to dwell on things that crop up during the day. Addressing  emotions regularly helps with the healing process. Therapy sessions are part of this but personal time is also important. By setting aside a specific time your mind will feel freer to address the present.When the past comes barreling forward at the worst time acknowledge what it is and then put it aside. You are in the present. You can address what came forward at another time. Healing is going to take time. It took years for all the damage that was done to accumulate. There is no magic spell for healing it all. Just take it one step at a time. As I said this is what I am thinking about this morning. And that is what is flowing out. I really wish someone could produce a wand and say the words Accio Peace for everyone on this board including myself. Though I am not HP I will do it anyway.Accio Peace,raisedbynarcissists,cwfwkpz,4,t5_2we9n

You say you dont think she has a personality disorder so perhaps her rage and complete lack of tact come from issues that she hasnt dealt with? My guess would be from your Ndad.Im so glad that therapist told them what they were doing isnt normal Im sorry for your sake that it went on for so long I can not imagine putting a freaking  year old on a diet.If your mom is truly more self aware then maybe she would be receptive to you outright telling her not to talk about your weight because it makes you feel bad? Or even get a sibling to do it if theyre willing? I spoke to my Nmother or maybe shes just heavily FLEAed Im not sure for my sister as her comments and questions about my sisters weight and diet were really upsetting her which is obviously a completely normal reaction. it worked at least for a while Ns seem to be very forgetful when it comes to the boundaries youve set in place but if your mom is not N then it might actually work.I did have to deal with weight stuff from my mother I had anorexiabulimia and when I was recovering she would say thing like you have a rounded stomach you have the family thighs thick thighs and then when I would get obviously upset she would try to play it off as if these were good things to have I wont judge whether these are good or bad but in the mind of someone recovering from an eating disorder these were bad.

This probably has been happening since you were too young to know what the definition on manipulation was. You have no responsibility for them training you to be their servant.By being angry at yourself for what they did...you are letting them still win.

It was strangely therapeutic seeing the nanny correct their mistakes and explain why they were wrong and how they were fucking up their children.One of the big ones when your kid is behaving badly the answer is never to behave worse to put the kid in their place. If you find yourself or your spouse throwing a tantrum like a twoyearold you have failed. Youre not teaching your kid anything but to either be terrified of you or never fully rely on you to be the adult or parent. I swear the only reason I have self control as an adult is because I am horrified by the idea of becoming like my parents who basically had none. I feel like I had to learn from a very young age that the only person I could rely upon to be emotionally stable was myself. One of the things I have been working through in therapy is that my self control and ego strength comes from a place of fear rather than confidence. It looks great on the surface but underneath its crippling.So maybe watch a television show like Nanny  and then go to parenting classes.

I definitely wouldnt require my daughters  and  yrs old to hang out with their brother  that is a really good point. My sons outbursts are generally directed at my husband and I but my daughters are definitely privy to them obviously. We have certainly talked to the older one about whats going on with her brother  hes now living with us  of the time and he basically had a monthlong breakdown after he disclosed the abuse  so it was obvious to her that some shit had gone down. Shes learning about bullying in school and weve talked about it in those terms both the abuse her brother suffered and his outbursts themselves.We have tried to strike a balance between explaining why her brother has these episodes which is not his fault and also that the outbursts are not okay and hes working with a doctor to try to get better which she seems to get on some level. She does still genuinely WANT to spend time with her brother for what its worth but we certainly wouldnt force her to do so. All that said I still have all three kids living under one roof and Im certainly open to ideas as Im obviously a bit lost. What kind of consequences would you enforce for these outbursts?

My good education doesnt negate the OPs situation and hisher legitimate frustration. I sadly know several people who were in similar circumstances. Anecdotally those who succeed so beautifully generally have higher IQs that allow them to succeed in spite of the situation rather than as a result of it.

Anyway what I learned of all that was that  feelings are what they are. I can tell him all day that something he feels just isnt logical and the only thing Im going to achieve is to get him irritated of my nagging. Then sometimes when I go past something I get this  well urge I guess. I want to buy that dress or I should talk to that geezer. I start thinking about it and I cant really cant defend that action  but the feeling doesnt go away. I know that if I dont follow my idea Im going to regret it later and wish I had done it.So  feelings arent silly and unimportant. They are very important. The love between you guys for example is important. Its something that is there it cannot be logically explained it just is.

5673586,0,t1_cwzue9n,Many species of cat big and small are conditionally social if conditions are favorable theyll hang out with each other but if food runs short theyll turn solitary.  Ive seen the change in a cat who was dumped downtown for being boring yes I know the former owners.  Well they made her sleep in the garage and shoved her out of the way whenever she came near.  My late MIL invited her in instead.  She was still more of a worker than a buddy but she would come and greet you when she came in to eat.  I accelerated the process by making a point of speaking to her whenever our paths crossed inviting her up to my lap etc.  She sort of woke up one day like Oh wow I have a family dont I?  After that she appointed herself the guardian of my MIL who insisted on going down to the basement to do laundry even though she had to connect herself to the oxygen that her family had piped all over the house.  The cat DID NOT LIKE THAT ATALL.  She would come to whoever else was in the house and yell and fuss and fuss!  She is NOT supposed to be down there!  I do NOT like the noises she makes hauling herself up the stairs!  And when she came back up the cat would anxiously check her over and plop herself down on her lap purring very loudly.,raisedbynarcissists,cx0d4t3,3,t5_2we9n

5722603,0,t3_3tg5cn,Wow.  My parents were bad at managing my sibling relations but thats way worse than anything I went through.I do know the flinching and jumpiness thing.  My youngest sister slightly older than me used to set up ambushes for me.  She would jump on me and pummel me tickle me I hated this more than being punched pin me down or grapple me briefly and then pretend she hadnt touched me.  Even when she wasnt doing this she reveled in popping out of places where I wasnt expecting her.  Many of her ambushes especially if anyone else was watching were  playful and apparently goodhumored.  Its just that the reason why she could always startle me was because when nobody was watching some of her ambushes were really awful and not playful at all.None of this is as bad as concussions cracked ribs or chipped teeth although I did get some black eyes and bloody noses out of it.  I didnt get the impression that my parents were encouraging this.  My sister just seemed bloody evil and good at lying.My youngest sister actually convinced my eldest sister to play with me in a similar way doing pounce and pin or pounce and tickle ambushes.  Unlike my youngest sister my eldest sister was a decent human being who stopped doing it forever when I said I hated it and asked her to stop.  There was a brief But you laugh objection and I said I cant help but laugh when you tickle me!  It doesnt mean Im having fun.  That was it.  If only that had worked on my youngest sister too.  Anyways I really do blame my sister for my jumpiness.  I got hardened against my mothers rages but my sisters ambushes could only be averted by hypervigilance.  I was still hypervigilant when I moved away.What seemed to help was physical contact with people I could trust.  Even just getting a backrub occasionally seemed to do wonders for making me not leap out of my skin whenever I see someone unexpected.  I dont know what mechanism was involved...  I may also be assigning causation to the wrong thing.  The causative factor could have been the fact that I moved away and was now hypervigilant against something with a  occurrence rate.,raisedbynarcissists,cx6g1zb,2,t5_2we9n

If you share a car with your sister do you have any proof of what you paid? I would say stop talking to your sister and your mom about anything until you can get away. Play dumb lie whatever. She is abusive physically and emotionally and she sounds like a scary human.

I dont know you Whatdo but you are an awesome awesome person and I already like you  Sadly enough my heart breaks at the same time that you have to see such inhumanity. I am not sure what country you are in but it should work about the same anywhere. You can call the police yourself and talk to an officer and follow what they say. If you follow what they ask then all should be cool. They should be able to walk you through the process and tell you how to help properly... Just follow their advice and it will be alright...Also talk to the hospital and they should be able to get someone to help you and your friend. They should mention about preserving evidence in brown paper bags not washing anything etc... I cannot stress how much your friendship probably means to your friend right now. I have been where you are and I would actually talk to a professional yourself and see what you can do how to support your friend and how you can get back to a semblance of normality yourself  and for her.Its going to be a process its going to take time its not going to be easy  but it will get better with the right help. I want you to know going to the police and charging this scum makes a real difference. You are most likely saving another person and most likely persons from a horrible crime. You are helping people and that makes such a difference in this world.If you need to vent here please do. If you want to PM and vent  no worries. I know there are a lot of people here that care very deeply about your friend and yourself here. Anything you need just post or drop a line. Yes it is unfair it sucks its horrible etc... but it can and will get better. I am so sorry you are going through this but I am so happy that your friend has a real honest and good person such as yourself to be there for them.

That it was okay that they acted the way they did and that I was just being extremely sensitive. Even now seeing all these stories and being able to say hey that happened to me just yesterday I still somehow think that its parents behavior normal and thats scary.And it just got me to thinking about how the way they treat me and my sister has affected me in my life. I cant talk in class. I cant raise my hand to answer a question. I cant meet new people face to face. I cant express my opinions.

5818555,0,t3_3uv8wz,Im sorry for your loss and this feeling that it cant be real is very normal.  I think its part of how our brain processes such a significant change in our lives.I dont know what sort of beliefs you have about what happens after death but even if you dont believe in any sort of spirit world or whatever you can know that the love your grandfather gave you and the things he taught you are always with you.  Where he stood up for you now you will have to stand up for yourself but you know how to do that because he showed you.  When people say mean things to you you know theyre wrong because he toldshowed you that.  Of course if your belief system allows you to think that we still exist after death then you can remind yourself that he is actually with you in other ways as well.  I personally believe that the people who love us keep loving us after they die and they are still watching over us.  But thats an individual thing.How you grieve  however you want.  Feel your feelings.  None of them are wrong.  I hope your grandfather left some kind of will  if he did then there need be no arguments about who gets what.  If it wasnt about money and just about household items then sure try to get a memento or two if you can but people fighting about who gets that chair or that vase are ridiculous and sickening and you dont have to be one of them.  ,raisedbynarcissists,cxich5y,2,t5_2we9n

5829930,0,t3_3v2a4s,Okay. I am going to try and break this one down.gt If my information is correct and your post on Facebook was directed towards your mom Im disappointed in you and irritated.Who cares if this guy is disappointed and irritated? He is not a parent not a relative and not a close friend. He is your Nmoms  on againoff again bed partner. gt While Im trying to preserve any good you and I have as far as a relationship and also protect the same between you and your mom I have to write this.He has no place trying to preserve the relationship you have with your Nmom. That is between the two of you. gt I spent years rebuilding my relationships with all of my Ex family ex wife  ex in laws  my girls ... The entire family. I have a great relationship with all of them and am very very thankful for it.gt The results are from my hard work as well as Everybody involved. Its a group effort. While the past is always there to distract me in this rebuilding process it serves no purpose in the now or in the future. I can talk volumes on this and without a doubt I know what works and what does not work.Who cares if he has a relationship with his exes. That has nothing to do with your situation. As far as I know what works and what does not work that is a joke. What works in one situation does not always work in another. People have different personalities. And Ns have issues that normal people dont.gt I have walked down that long dark depressing road and found it easier and very very rewarding to chose the better path. That path does NOT include the past.Sorry being an RBN means the past is always with us in our relationships with Ns. We work to get through the issues but they are always in the shadows. And we know that you can never forget an N is an N unless you want to pay the price.gt So whats up with the cheap shot via Facebook ? Not only is that a cheap shot cowardly and the easy way out its timing ref GC sisters current situation your mom is all stressed out  so your timing is deliberate to cause the most damage. I see grade school antics nothing more. If there is a call for help in there somewhere  it failed.I read it as a call for help and the call of an RBN being faced with yet another injustice from an N. Being ignored when life is difficult is the hardest part of being RBN. You know that your Nmom would have ignored you even if GCSis was having a perfectly fine life moment.gt I spend a lot of time helping Nmother improve her relationship with you. Why ? Because she wants the best for you and wants to do right by you no matter the past. Shes all in to improve the relationship are you?Yeah right. Ns actions speak louder than words. Nmom has more than one child and only puts the effort into the one child GCSis. She has no time to deal with any other child. gt In the last year or so I thought your relationship with Nmother improved and was well on its way to a long loving trusting relationship. Now this post comes along and does damage unasses all the positive work. All that hard work shot down in seconds. Is that the result you wanted? If so it worked.This smacks of the boyfriend being an N. He is worried about all his effort going to waste. Not the fact that you are not getting any support from your Nmom. gt Was there something you needed from Nmother or me that we did not do ? Did we drop the ball ? Did we not have a great time at your wedding? Is there something from the past year of building good that happened to account for your post? Or is it all about something in the past years ago that is behind this post ?Was there something you needed from Nmom? Ummm a lifetime of love and support that wasnt there. From him? Nothing. Did they drop the ball? Sure. Giving all the attention and support to one child at the expense of another but that is normal in an Ns world. Did they not have a good time at your wedding? Who cares at this point? Is there something from the past year? ummm nothing out of the norm for a SGIs it all about the past? It is just a continuation of the past. gt I dont know.Yeah you dont know anything about being RBN. gt What I do know ..... The past will pull you down. Energies spent on the past will keep the past in the present. So you chose to give life to the past  you will always be living in the past. Change will not happen the pain will not ever go away and life is too short for any of thatChange has to happen on both sides to heal a relationship. Change on one side does nothing. gt Take care push for the positive and I hope you find that peace you are looking for. You are the driver steer it in the right direction.gt I am always available to discuss the past  only if it is to drive past it and lead to a better place.gt What I cant do wont do is participate in living in the past so if your direction is to stay in the past we wont have much to say to each other.Who gives a fuck? gt One of your words assumptions  is what you leave people to work with. I find most people do not like to deal with the personal in public.No an N just likes to bash you to everyone and anyone who will listen like her NBoyfriend who has no clue. gt Tho your statement eludes to the problem the details are left out so others either assume or chase you down for more details. Is that a test to see if others care ? The chase. It has nothing to do with the chase. It has everything to do with putting out a cry of pain when you are down.gt My approach has always been one on one. If both parties are honest the helping begins and becomes easier. No wasted energy on getting to the point of the problem. Those energies are best used to solve the problem.Again who gives a fuck? gt Your sister asks direct questions asks for help directly as does brother. The results from that instant help. I dont understand the chase before you expect help ? I just dont understand it. Yeah. the GCSis whines about life being difficult and gets all the attention she wants. The SG is having issues and doesnt even merit a phone call or a text message asking how things are. The SG knows better than to ask for help. The help will either come with a major price attached to it. Or the call for help will be ignored or derided.gt At this point my expectations as you and I have this discussion is Ill become part of the bad people in your life. I.e. There will be backlash  which just makes it harder to approach you. I dont own that you do.Ummm since when did you view him as a mentor and as a positive force in your life? I kinda get the impression he is not much more than your mothers fuck buddy. gt To sum it up you cant kick someone in the balls and then expect a hug.gt Your Facebook antics are just that a kick in the balls slap in the face.Only from the perspective of someone who has done something to see it as a personal insult instead of the frustration and anger of an RBN. gtAnyway Im not looking for any apologies from you on the face book thing as it does me no harm it only pushes people away from your needs.Why would you be issuing any apologies especially to him? Classic gaslighting. He is trying to set himself up as a wise elder who is only there to help you the lowly uneducated idiot. He is trying to frame your mother as a recovering saint and you as the lowly sinner daring to go against the him and the saint. He doesnt acknowledge any of what you said in your first email reply.

Repayment of tuition will not make your relationship healthy or good for you. You may feel smug for a few days but this wont give you the emotional vindication youre looking for. The most important thing to remember is that your mom probably doesnt truly care about the money  she cares about using money as a tool to control your relationship. This is likely why you want to repay the money  because you have likely been taught your whole life that money is a tool for power. Reimbursing the cost of tuition will not change your relationship.

I dont know if you have kids but having your kid tell you I hate you even at  when they dont even know what the word means feels like someone just punched you in the stomach. Its ok for kids to sometimes see their parents sad and to have to apologize for hurting someone. This is how kids learn and practice empathy. In fact this kid apologized all on her own which is even better because it shows that she has grown up in a house where feelings are important. You dont want a kid that will never apologize for hurting someones feelings. Ideally you want them to be sensitive to others pain. And by the way...

Which as you can see from the jokes she still does. I ended up just saying That would be lovely. But to establish a jokey relationship you cant really start from a place where all your jokes are at the other persons expense. Of course she doesnt get it and doesnt understand why we cant just jump straight from a background of horrible toxicity and abuse almost daily screaming rows and nearconstant sniping to a casual jokey ooh lets make fun of each other in an affectionate way how lovely thing all of a sudden. Even when I explained that it wasnt just me I had that sort of relationship with loads of my friends because we STARTED OUT that way she didnt understand and just took it as an attack on her.

It was also a great reason to not see her or call because I was always busy studying or working or out with my friends.

5940007,0,t3_3woipu,My husband put up the Christmas lights on the house today. Such a simple simple task. And I cried and cried when they were done.Because he doesnt care if theres lights on the house but he knows I do. So he bundled up and went out on the roof in the cold wind and set them up. He set up the timer. He REARRANGED the lights so that they were even on the house and looked nice. He pulled me outside to show me how beautiful our home was we just moved to a new house. He did all of this not because he cares how the house looks but because he knows I care. He did it because he loves me. And I cried and cried.I cried because its so foreign to me to be loved like that even after  years of marriage. I cried because of all the years of love I could have had that were lost. I cried because Ive finally gone NC and this new house is the first address where my NMom doesnt know where I live. I cried because he loves me and its just simple. I dont have to fight for his affection I dont have to be good to be loved he just loves me.I cry often when I have simple loving moments with my son as well. Hes a super empathetic child very very loving likes to tell people I love you and give lots and lots of hugs. The love I feel for him breaks my heart for the love I never had as a child. The things my NMom put me through  she cant possibly have loved me truly and still done those things. It always blows me away when I look at my son and think about things my NMom did and cant even begin to understand reacting the way she did. Prime Example we were decorating the tree tonight. Kiddo was thirsty and brought his water into the living room where its carpeted. We reminded him to be careful he didnt want to spill it and he mostly was. And at one point while laughing and dancing around he very gently hit the cup and it knocked over almost a full glass into the carpet. His lip started to tremble and his father and I both jumped up. Its okay! Just water no harm done! Lets clean it up together! Bring your cup so we can refill it! Lets maybe keep it in the kitchen so it doesnt tip over again? and we showed him how to use a towel to mop water out of carpet and that was that. NMom would have berated me sent me to bed without finishing the tree or a bedtime snack and there would have been plenty of tears.

5969899,0,t1_cy23858,My nMom was actually an alcoholic while sober she could be the best mother to us that one could hope for. While drunk however and increasingly while sober as time went on she could exhibit a disturbing lack of empathy and seemed to enjoy pushing our buttons. She also used my older siblings as parentsbyproxy I may have been one of her SGs because I had showed signs of deep anxiety and possible PTSD from an early age  zoning out was a coping mechanism for the nearconstant emotional conflict going on all around me. I love my siblings dearly but they clearly resented having to take along their little sister to their hangouts and later my brother took out on our younger sister and me his frustrations and terror of being a homosexual at a time when such a thing was still a huge scandal. Speaking up about it was impossible Mom was home alone most of the time Dads work kept him away and was thus Mother of the Year to most other people in the community. That was part of my own experience. However its not unheardof overall for longterm alcoholics to have their brain functioning including their affect altered permanently by the effects of alcohol. Alcohol plays havoc with our neurotransmitters and can actually worsen anxiety and depression and increase the risk of alcoholic psychoses. Much of the science behind this is quite new the oldtimers in recovery both friends of Bill andor Lois might tell you that youll reveal when drunk what youd never reveal when sober that drinking can bring out the core self. That core self is wounded in many cases deeply when we begin to drink indeed for many alcoholics those wounds opened us up in the first place to the possibility that alcohol could ease that pain. Some describe alcoholism as a state of arrested development that our emotional selves have stopped growing at the point at which we developed the disease so that our core self is that of the child or adolescent again though this could be a result of the changes in brain chemistry caused by excessive alcohol consumption.  Part of the spirit of the  Steps is to examine that core and to work on it so that the recovered self is better than we were stepping into the rooms for the first time. Many people see the goal of AA as merely to stop drinking while thats certainly an immediate goal the stretch goal as it were is to become a better person more in tune with our feelings better equipped to cope with lifes stresses in healthy ways more willing to take care of ourselves first and to be happier with ourselves. Its not unlike the steps we take as ACoNs to become better people in spite of the narcissistic behaviour of our parents or other relatives. Ive spent  years and counting in the rooms Im not leaving anytime soon but its only been in the last two years that I was finally able to put a name to the kind of behaviour that left me shamed to my core and cut into my soul and left me seemingly without recourse. Once I realized that narcissism perhaps triggered by alcoholism but possibly just comorbid with it sat behind much of my own emotional suffering the last of my core burden felt lifted from me. I used to suffer shame flashbacks where Id get something coming back from my childhood that just brought me low all of a sudden until I found RBN and was able to put a label on what had happened to me. Now if I feel anything like that coming on Im able to talk myself through it  You were just a kid think about who you were then its in the past nobody else would remember this those who do wouldnt say anything those who would say something may be toxic. Thanks to my program I found the courage to look through that baggage and unpack it and then put it away. ,raisedbynarcissists,cy26nw1,1,t5_2we9n

Your counterpart should have given you a run down on your privileges.You see because your assumed spouse is your sponsor to be on base anyone you bring on automatically becomes his or her responsibility too.

6071838,0,t3_3ype7v,From the guys side of things... I can tell you that my Nmom hated any woman any of her three sons got involved with and did everything possible to torpedo the relationships. She insisted that my brothers first wife was bipolar nonsense and gleefully helped break up the marriage. She insulted the intelligence of another brothers first serious girlfriend and told her she was below my brothers station. She told my own girlfriends they werent welcome in her home and accused my eventual wife of sabotaging my career out of selfishness. And of course she used her Nsmear tactics to campaign lustily against all of them with other relatives  although they eventually had her number and stopped listening. My Nmom is the reason my very nice MIL finally got caller ID... so shed never again knowingly pick up the phone to find Nmom there. So yeah shell talk shit about you when your back is turned.This attackthegirl stuff is right out of the Nmoms playbook. If theyve engaged in explicit parentification of their sons in earlier life or still imagine themselves delusional as it maqy be as the alpha relationship with their adult son you represent a threat. AdviceKeep your SO fully dialed in and secure his support.Minimize your contacts with the N. Never spend time with her alone make sure there are always witnesses.Realize the Nsyndrome is nothing you can overcome or repair. It was deepseated long before you showed up. You cant fix this.Be very careful about how much you put yourself out there in pursuit of closeness. Civility is fine be civil but do not expect an alternate motherdaughter bond to develop. Shes perhaps not capable. Expecting too much will lead to anger and heartbreak.Dont be defensive about assuming the alpha relationship with your SO. Thats whats normal.Treat the Nmom as the child you dont yet have  a petulant toddler who is not in control of her emotions. You dont let an outofcontrol rude child hurt  damage you... the kid just irritates you from time to time. Firewall yourself from this narcissist in similar fashion. And she is after all a selfcentered child in a grownups body. ,raisedbynarcissists,cyfi7n5,6,t5_2we9n

6142727,0,t1_cynuxp0,Thank you for your perspective.  There is validity there.  Voilent outbursts punching a wall were before the child and responses to current abuse triggering past abuse.  Getting that under control is important though I took care of that.. Nothing like having a kid to show you whether or not you really are selfish.  Now Im left with very minimal emotinal outbursts usually me yelling for help while she tries to hurt herself or me getting very impatient with invasive gaslighting.  And all the focus is on me.. and having healthier responses.. No discussion of my partner having complete meltdowns and harassing me insulting me yelling at me and gaslighting me.. My partner and I talk about it but the therapist is constantly validating her feelings checking with her to see if what Im saying about my role is true and she feels supported.. Its feels very much one way and biased in that.So yes that should be the concern.. But it feels like the concern is for her about me when I feel like Im being ridiculously generous in saying its even because its not.  And at this point after the life Ive lived I dont really want to deal with more people not believing me,raisedbynarcissists,cynv3rm,2,t5_2we9n

6149159,0,t3_3zq4wl,In my N fathers case I grew up hearing lurid tales of how he was abused as a child.   I believe him because he described in detail the psychological atmosphere  the way HIS N father would pick a fight if my dad seemed too happy about something and would end up belting him across the face.  My fathers face still twitches when hes under stress.  I also think that he felt neglected and resented by his mother.  She told him that she didnt want to have children and that when she got pregnant felt she had to quit her dissertation it was the early s and give her beloved dog away.  He was also a chubby kid who was often bullied by others.  I see a great deal of shame and fear beneath my fathers narcissistic behaviors and histrionic personality.  The anxiety is almost palpable.  He talks and talks and talks and freaks out a little bit if he thinks the person listening to him isnt paying attention anymore.  I think he feels he needs to bully people even me when I was a little girl so he can feel worthy and strong and thus keep the shame and fear at bay.  I am not excusing it at all. I also had moments when I think I might have been going down the road towards becoming a narcissist.  When youre bullied and ignored as a kid youre desperate to feel strong and powerful.  There were a couple of times  around age ten  when I bullied other children but I felt ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE about it afterwards and made a choice to stop doing things like that.  There were also times when I felt that my father was trying to push me to become like him  a time when he reduced a woman to tears just because she was an easy mark and then looked at me for approval I was about  or  and another time when I was  when I put someone down in a snotty way and he told me he approved!  I have since eradicated I hope all such tendencies in myself but I can see how I COULD have towards that as a way to cope and get my father to back me. ,raisedbynarcissists,cyolfgr,1,t5_2we9n

6157477,0,t1_cypepv9,What resources did you use to read up on it? I frequently have a really hard time remembering what anyone said to me during an argument even if it has just happened because it is as if my brain actively doesnt want me to remember whats just happened. Sometimes Ive been known to just totally shut down and not reply to someone too although that doesnt happen that much. I can see and hear them I largely know whats going on but I have a random inner monologue which tells me to just keep quiet and seems to try to process whats happening. My head feels very foggy and although I know Im alive where I am and that Im midwhatever argumentfreaking out sessionwhatever I feel like Im not properly in my own skin a if Im a cm or two behind myself and things are careering out of control. Thankfully that rarely happens these days as I live with someone who isnt an n but sometimes Im still triggered and the whole forgetting what has just been said during an argument is definitely still a regular issue.Ive been subjected to gaslighting a lot whilst growing up from my nMother and from relatives who Im starting to believe are possible ns.Edit.When I was much younger I used to try and imagine I could fall down into the cracks of the pavement and be safe there. I freaked out about being bullied at school about not being safe at home about dying about child birth and this was all when I was under  years old. For some reason I thought that being very very small and being protected from all sides would make me safe. I also used to go through something when I was in bed when I would obsess and freak out about thick and thin things. It lasted although it decreased a lot by then until my teens and the very last time I had it was when I had been given antidepressants for the first time in my early s. I didnt continue with the antidepressants. All I can say about it was that it was as if I would lose control of my mind for a little while whilst in bed always in bed and I would feel physical distress at the idea of touching something very rounded and fatlarge and then my mind would flick to thinking about something very thin and I would feel overwhelming disgust distress and discomfort at the idea of touching something very thin. I have no idea what any of that was about. I dont know if it has any roots in my mother telling me I was overweight from a very young age and her own eating disorder. I dont know if it is linked to the obsessive tendencies which seem to run in my family possibly passed on from an older relative who may well have had OCD. I dont know what was going on but Ive often wondered if there was something wrong with me.,raisedbynarcissists,cypjhl6,3,t5_2we9n
6157566,0,t3_3zrfrz, year old Adult Child of Narcs with Narc in laws and  kids  and  years old.I made the mistake of thinking oh my children need grandparents despite knowing how toxic all  where. It finally took  separate incidents of severe emotional psychological and physical abuse each incident perpetuated by one of the  grandparents over the course of  visits that made me realize what a child actually needs in their life is emotionally stable warm and loving adults. I had wasted more than a decade trying to teach my parents and in laws to be emotionally stable warm and loving people. I now know that they are just too damaged to be able to do this for my kids and actually hurt them and my relationship with my kids instead.The emotionally stable warm and loving adults do not need to be blood relatives. They can be neighbors teachers work colleagues and sports coaches. They do not need to be permanent fixtures in the childs life. Each emotionally stable warm and loving adult will bring to your child different gifts of love and care which they will remember.The final four things the grandparents did to my kids one grandparent told my kids I was mean for making them go to bed early both aged under  years and  pm bed time and promised if they ran away from home and when to live with that grandparent they would never have to follow any rules they could do what they wanted when they wanted. After this visit reestablishing bed time and other basic rules was hell and my kids kept screaming at me I was a mean mother. one grandparent giving my under  years daughter the message not exact words but this is what was meant she was going to be as fat as your Mom when she grows up and when you get boobs you are going to look as awful as your Mom looks. This was my mother by the way who has an hour glass figure which I inherited and I had just passed grading for my nd Dan Karate black belt. I was in top fitness at that point.  physically assaulted the  year old child and hurt them so bad they screamed in pain. Then asked why is the stupid child crying I did not hurt them. I should have called the police and got them prosecuted. I deeply regret that I did not. teased the younger child to the point of tears while mocking the other for attempting to deflect the emotional hurt with counter points which were positive. When challenged about this later I was not present I was basically told the teased child needs to develop a sense of humor. Again both under the age of . months later my husband was offered a new job with a work visa across a major ocean. We emigrated. Have not seen any of the grandparents in years will never return to home country to visit until all  are dead.

Id gladly pay what I owe back only I dont make that much sorry if I branched into a side topic Ill definately look those up I just cant seem to be able to sleep.

I did alot of mistakes then my sadness leads me to doing more mistakes the effect of verbal and physical abuse which then makes me sad which leads me to do more mistakes.. And all of them involve money so my parents have been torturing me from when I was an undergrad to now nonstop may I add. Which instead of helping me to be self sufficient quickly turned me into a person with lots of phobia and toxicity.

6211185,0,t1_cyvmpj7,gt As Ive worked through some of my anger I understand that the abuse that happened in my life wasnt about me at all it was just a result of her being a very damaged person.Bravo.  I think its really hard because the Narcs teach us that we need to bear their pain with them.  If they feel it we need to feel it too.  That were responsible for helping them get through it.As I continued my path to independence and realized that I dont have to suffer for her I could see pretty clearly how I was drowning in her suffering before.  Once I let that go I could empathize with her suffering without it affecting me.I certainly used to be a lot more angry but I think that was mostly a defensive measure because I didnt realize yet that I didnt have to set myself on fire to keep her warm.  She could just put on a sweater.  The fact that she continually chose not to was on her not on me no matter how much she wanted me to feel otherwise.,raisedbynarcissists,cyvn80s,5,t5_2we9n
6212218,0,t3_40ky0i,OK. I got out of a relationship with an N last year. The agony of being thrown out like a piece of trash led me on this journey of looking into why it felt sooooo familiar.These friends are flying monkeys at best and apathetic about your pain at worst. No one. No. Flipping. One. gets to dictate to you a timeline for your grief. You feel it til it stops. You deal how you deal. Point  about flying monkeys. They care about whatever woo woo ideas are in their head more than they care about you  your mental health your boundaries your safety. Point  I know uemeraldead is coming from a good place. In normal relationships yeah there will be contact at some point. But reading that line makes me want to jump around and yell. After a friend has been emotionally manipulated read abused by someone it is time to freaking grow a backbone and take sides people. Decide who you trust. Go with that person. Anything else is siding with the bully.I am still white hot mad at some people if I start to think about it like now. Can you tell?? lol! I had friends who told me to get over it. Sure Ill just get over it for your convenience. I was facing the wall wanting to die a couple weeks ago. Ill just be chipper for you. Right. I asked them not to tell me about this person because it triggered the PTSD he had delightfully left me with. No they HAD to tell me about his two new girlfriends. They HAD to tell me how he came over to their house with his new GF. They HAD to let me know he had a car wreck. So you know what I HAD to do? I had to cut them off. You dont need fake friends OP. You will find some true blue ones I did. Two of my friends were immediately like F that guy. Im so sorry that happened to you. Can I do anything to help you heal?

6237945,0,t3_40xuka,This guy I befriended is starting to creep me out. Were both in wheelchairs and both went to the same college. I graduated from there three years ago and hes there now. He keeps asking me to come visit but I barely remember anyone there at this point I dont drive and the campus is a gigantic hill meaning Id need my power chair which wont fit in a car.He knows this yet he then asks So how about taking the train. Again I dont drive so Id have no way of getting to the campus from the train station near there or back to my apartment when I get home. So then he asks if I can transfer into a vehicle. Now this is the point where my red flags started going off. First of all thats none of your business. Im not about to let you convince someone who has a car to drive all the way the fuck out to where I live then drive me back. And Im damn sure not staying the night either. Second of all if you really understood my lack of transportation issues youd compromise and....I dont know Skype or something? But no. He tagged me in some note on Facebook about how he cant wait to meet me and well have a lasting friendship forever. Then he messages me privately saying how hes determined to get me back here. On the public post he tagged me in I stupidity said Thanks see you soon. I regret it because my friend who also went there said that she was concerned about my safety if I did go and Im starting to see her point. Anytime I mention anything college related thats his dog whistle to start messaging me privately about wanting to visit all over again. I shouldnt have added him. It began as him messaging me privately and more or less saying Hey! Were both in wheelchairs and went to the same college. Everyone talks about you. Were friends now right?My friend even suggested that hes gay and might be attracted to me Im straight and offered to have her boyfriend and older brother take me there so I wouldnt go alone.

I think it might be a good idea to see what you can find.  My EN?dad was diagnosed by someone through church as bipolar but all he ever received to take were strange vitamin drinks... Of course nmom was whispering what she learned at church that all mental illness was either sign of sin or a sign of weakening faith.  The same church that diagnosed him!  It was all part of her smear campaign and I think he was just settling into being married to a sociopath that would make anybody moody as fuck.  Mine were the opposite with meds though extremely withholding when I was sick or injured.  I mean right up to  yold.  A headache didnt deserve anything even though it has always been migraines for me I just didnt know any word other than headache.  UNLESS we were traveling.

I deleted her from facebook didnt responed to her texts and if she called the house I had my sister say i was gone. A few months after i moved in my boyfriend proposed. This was a little hard to keep under wraps. My aunt died about a month after it happened and i had to take my mom to the funeral. She found out when i was telling another family member. From then on the pressure increased. More phone calls texts and random stop ins. I went no contact soon after. She wasnt invited to the wedding and miraculously she didnt come even though my grandma tried to bribe her. I already had my social security number and i just went to the court house and bought a new birth certificate before the wedding. I didnt have any money saved up but i got a factory job that paid  an hour and had massive overtime. The last i saw her was at my nieces  year birthday party in november.

6398470,0,t3_438ovw,Theres a lot of good advice here. I went through a similar period last year for much of the year and I think it was made much harder by having narcissistic parents.Dealing with feeling shitty while trying to express yourself in a positive way is real hard but it can definitely be done. What helped me was being extra generous with myself around the time Id have an interview. Id also prepare by doing a lot of writing where I forced myself to think about accomplishments and what I like about myself. By doing a good amount of that I was able to feel better about my abilities than I generally do and despite tons of social anxiety I eventually learned to interview better and better and I eventually got hired.Also It seems like your mother has hurt you tremendously but that doesnt mean that you somehow deserved to be hurt.

Obviously not in all casespeople are people and dont conform to wide genderbased stereotypes necessarily.But many others most notably women but anyone sensitive and prone to sadness rather than anger dont want you to give advice and solve things. They want you to empathize feel their pain and understand why they feel it. And maybe later after their done feeling bad about it then the problem can be worked on. But dont rush that.Once youve come to this realization it becomes easier to adjust your approach based on who youre speaking with and what you know about them. For example I know my general approach is to immediately get angry on someones behalf something they dont really want quite often! and offer ways to fix it.

Work out where your last trip went wrong and how you might deal with this next time.If anyones tempted to do this have a sober experienced tripsitter you trust around it sounds pretentious but learning to meditate is useful its easy to get stuck in thought loops that you need to be able to detach yourself from be in a safe space make sure you have nothing to do the next day and make sure you have a mental happy place to go to if things get too intense. Playing video games your favourite music thinking about a happy memory etc. Also simply changing the lighting or walking to a different room can help if things get too intense. ,raisedbynarcissists,czk1dv9,1,t5_2we9n

Im not going to assume that you are a female or male because my brothers are totally able to borrow the more gender neutral clothes of my sisters. Real Men Real Style is more aimed toward business casualformal but as a woman Ive found some of the tips to be invaluable. Like if you are wearing black leather shoes have a black leather beltpurse.  Its aimed toward male fashion which is much less variable than womens but it doesnt lack similar fashion tips. Its how to dress well.Im a seamstress so in some ways I can cheat with clothing. However Ive learned that I look best in the things that Ive made for myself. It might be worth finding a local seamstress to maketailor clothes for you or learning on your own. Ive turned cotton sheets from Goodwill into regular clothes or costumes. Im currently on turning seven pairs of jeans into skirts I wore out the inner thighs of them. So have a friend with seamstressing skills is a huge plus.I knit so I can make myself luxury items for myself at a fraction of what it would cost to pay for someone else to make it or to buy something of similar quality. I also tend to offer this to friends because sometimes you need that confidence boost of having something that no one else can possibly have.Bargain shopping is another way to build your wardrobe with high quality items without breaking the bank. Fred Meyer is one of my favorites for this. They often do the  off of clearance price once a month or every other month. This is an additional  off the MARK DOWN price. So Ive gotten boots that were regularly retailed at  marked down to  for  a pair. These arent inferior quality items either. They last for YEARS with constant use.This same  off clearance can also be for marked down gift sets household items blankets dishes toys ect. Its a great way to stock up on things you need from a store with generally higher quality items for less than Walmart price. ,raisedbynarcissists,czrleel,7,t5_2we9n

Yeah therapy is expensive and regular talk therapy can only do so much to heal trauma. There are some new therapies like emdr that help a lot of people but were all different.  Ive had maybe  years of therapy for anxiety and depression and it gave me a lot of self awareness  but I still didnt get what was happening until I was diagnosed with cptsd. I tried emdr but it wasnt helpful. Thats why I took up meditation. Im allergic to religion  religious abuse survivor but meditation isnt a religious thing its more of a mental exercise.  I do a lot of walking. I gave myself permission to avoid triggery situations. I stopped taking ssri meds and just do CBD and supplements like gaba. I limit my caffeine. Ive ended relationships with people who arent good to be with. All of it has left me feeling much more comfortable and happy.

I worked my consistently listened was a very structured environment with a lot of frustrations and in general bullshit to deal with but I managed to get out.Heres what you can do. You can try employment services for a higher paying job but Ive found these unreliable for job security. You might get lucky and find a hr job and theyll keep you. You can save money enough for a down payment to move out and do so as soon as you can.If you make under  a year you can get food stamps at least in NC Its not much but its a starter pack and its how Im living on my own now. I work full time for unskilled labor have food stamps most of my paycheck goes for rent I cook most of my own food and I sit around and not do much now. I cant afford to do anything. But Im surviving. I do ask for money from my toxic family which I hate but its a sacrifice for some financial security and Id be able to survive without it.I hope any of this helps. ,raisedbynarcissists,czx77ma,3,t5_2we9n

6605282,0,t3_4626q3,Woah are you me? I moved away from my Nparents for the first time when I was  years old. Immediately found myself in an abusive relationship. Only lived on my own for about a year and a half as I went to an art school I eventually failed at. I took up smoking and brushed against having an alcohol problem at one point.Moved back in with Nparents after a severe mental breakdown that sent me to the hospital. Stayed with Nparents and lived in a literal dog shed that had been turned into a bedroom. Tried to go back to school but only because Nmom was telling me I needed to be a nurse technician. I ended up failing because I couldnt bring myself to give a shit about what I was learning. Almost never had a job except for tiny art related gigs. Got into another abusive relationship at  and moved out with no job barely survived for  years as I dealt with an abusive relationship that almost lead to me killing myself. Ended up taking one of the abusers enablers to court had them fined k Being able to fight back helped and I had the luck of having a few really really good friends. I started going to college for a THIRD TIME. I didnt have any direction and I desperately needed the schedule and social outreach. Yes it was rough to be around normal people. It was rough to hear about their normal parents and normal lives. It especially hurts when something family related comes up in the material. This made it difficult for me to learn spanish because its so family oriented. The thing is many people may appear to be living typical lives when the reality may be much different. Are there any support groups or clubs available at your college? Meeting people who are in a similar situation might help! Im determined to see this course through but part of me feels as if theres no ever getting around the time Ive lost allowing myself to be downtrodden by my parents. I feel you there. I only recently realized how much time I lost with my parents and Im still very angry about it. That part...that part only goes away with patience and time. Ive found that the only way to make that feeling go away permanently is to focus on yourself. Do whatever you can to get where you want to in life. I find that the busier I am the less time I have to dredge up old bad memories. What also helps me is that I try not to see the experience as lost time. Yes I would have spent my life differently if I could have but I never chose to have such irresponsible parents. Yes I grew up really stunted in some ways but I vastly grew in a different way because I survived the experience at all. They were bad years but at least I got them out of the way early! The way I see it is that nothing could be worse than living in that cycle of abuse. My brothers never made it out and my sister will most likely never make it out. The cycle was a living embodiment of hell. I did not choose this hell I was born into it. However I got out of it. You got out of it. Yes what should have been the best years of our lives were our worst because we had to spend them in an emotional hell. Those years werent wasted just because we used them for escaping. ,raisedbynarcissists,d02jhqw,3,t5_2we9n

Its actually the opposite. You were acting normal and your mom is awful. Kids dont listen. Its just the way they are and thats ok.

There is a reason why colleges typically go to huge effort to adjudicate charges of wrongdoing internally  sometimes with comically unqualified or biased kangaroo disciplinary panels  rather than involve local police and prosecutors. These panels issue insanely wrongheaded rulings on a regular basis that cannot be appealed  expelling innocent students etc. But the vast majority of campus assaults and other midlevel crimes worse than petty theft short of grand larceny or murder are concealed from public view this way which is the real goal.Needless to say I would not bet the beer money on a panel of professors  amateur jurists taking sides against a fellow professor.I am glad OP had a sensitive reception in the meeting described but would not hold out any hope for justice via the schools internal judicial system.,raisedbynarcissists,d061ltj,7,t5_2we9n

Those are very different things.  So if youre willing to let go of your anger and rage youll reap the benefits while still protecting yourself and maintaining boundaries from Ns.  Hes pained?  Its because he isnt getting what he wants  a relationship he didnt foster encourage maintain.  He treated you like crap back then so theres nothing reasonable on which to base an adult relationship. I have this problem with my Nmom.  She sees the other mothers and daughters in the rest home interacting so lovingly but we dont have that.  Its not there because thats not the relationship she fostered growing up.  I cant just flip a switch and get over it.  The foundation of trust and mutual respect is just not present and never will be.So if you forgive your father it releases you from the anger but you dont have to absolve him of responsibility.  Thats HIS burden.  NC is a great punishment for family members who abuse yet expect to be treated as if they were the greatest relative in the world when theyre old.

But the fact that he had reported and that I had gone on record with him really helped my case with CPS when the abuse did turn physical. Unfortunately I think that is what it takes to get removed from a middleclass suburban home which most in CPS would see as a dream situation for a child. Remember too that CPS and the cops see fake reporting all the time and so are not necessarily always assuming a context of abuse. They start off by sideeying the claims of anyone who appears to be in what they consider to be a healthy household.

Youll often hear stories of Nparents accusing their daughterinlaws of brainwashing their GCs when they stop following orders so readily.This puts the GC in the position of choosing sides and GCs often side with the mother when push comes to shove. All she has to do is start crying and press his guiltbuttons to take advantage of his need to please people and resolve conflicts.Your SO might be willing to stick up to his mother right now if theres nothing really at stake but if his NMom raises those stakes he may change his tune.

6739063,0,t3_47vk7w,Newcomer here not too familiar with this subreddit and not entirely sure I fit in but I have been feeling the same exact way. I feel like an orphan. My parents have never visited me once in the  years since Ive moved out. Theyve never called. Any effort to communicate is mine. Used to email with my mom a lot but eventually that died down barely hear from her anymore and she takes forever to reply if at all. No communication with my dad at all. All my life theyve been too preoccupied with the booze. Cant even be bothered to send a Christmas card or a birthday card. Im giving up on them ever changing.

The book that really helped me was The Dance of Anger Particularly Chapter  it led me to draw out the genealogy of my family and look for patterns. What I saw was pretty astounding as it kind of explained why my parents seem to naturally gravitate to siding with my Nbro and it changed my world. It didnt excuse anything but I feel like I understand a little better now. YES! My Emom does the exact same get along nonsense. This was basically what our Christmas fight was about.

My DHs parents are both pretty classic NPD.  His GC brother has been saying things like Moms dementia is getting worse.  Um no not really. She never had dementia and still doesnt. She has ALWAYS been engaged in feuds with one family member or another ALWAYS been irrational selfcentered flying off the handle seemingly randomly... he just didnt see it as much until recently because he was a GC. Now that hes closer to his sister nMIL is x worse to females and nMIL sh!ttalks his sister to him and he knows shes wrong hes starting to see this side of nMIL more clearly. To him this means she has some sort of late and very slow onset dementia or something. OP my guess is that because you have reducedeliminated contact she has started to make your brother a SG at least some of the time and since he was not before ? he is interpreting this as dementia.

6774485,0,t3_48fn1v,I dont hate them but I have a very ingrained subconscious reaction that sees children as potential abusers and it makes me want to avoid them at all costs. Growing up other children were essentially allowed to mistreat me in whatever fashion they wished with no repercussions and so I learned pretty fast that if children were present nothing good was likely to come of it. Nowadays I understand intellectually that I am the adult and in what society considers to be the position of power but my subconscious sees children and thinks FLEE! FLEE TO THE HILLS!!! It doesnt help that our current society tends to be extremely childcentric and attacks anyone who isnt seen to virtually worship children I dont know how to interact with children at all which reinforces my subconscious notion that Id best stay away from them if I dont want Bad Things To Happen either at their hands or at the hands of their parents.

6802896,0,t1_d0i4h8o,Heya! I didnt get half of what you said had to google CPTSD amp Pete Walker... So I will rephrase and let me know if I got it right.Do you mean that my procrastination could be due to past trauma  abuse and not only ADHD? That when I should be doing something I get stuck in an emotional flashback consciously or not which stops me in my tracks?gtturning inward on my emotional experience which was stunted on ADHD medication is actually whats helping me get better.Can you expand on that a little? You mean that you think addressing the underlying emotional issue helped but the ADHD meds because they helped in other ways made it harder to face the problem or Im guessing delayed the necessity to do so? In Russell Barkleys video posted by another redditor above he mentions that therapy is not very effective for ADHD patients because we need problem solving in the very environment where we face the problem. He gives the example of socializing kids explaining that social skill training doesnt work unless its done with the actual social group the kid interacts with in real life. So in short Im getting a little suspicious of therapy. I think its still worth the outlet and it feels great to have someone listen to anything I say without judgement but I wonder how much power it has to change my behavior in deeper ways. Which means I really wonder what it can do for me regarding potential trauma.  So back to your experience Im really curious how did you solve that underlying emotional trauma? When you say turning inward on my emotional experience what does it mean like what does it actually imply what steps could I take now to get this started?

One thing I dont like about talking to therapists is that figure it out yourself way of talking that sounds really condescending. Not only that but the figure it out yourself is really common sense and I already do that. I havent been taught anything new. Ive already done my own research and have my own theories and what not. I dont understand this idea of going to therapy being voluntarily vulnerable just because this person has a license. Theres no emotional bond I just dont give a shit to be perfectly honest. Of course I care but how deep does that realistically run? But I still feel responsible since weve entered each others lives. And I dont like to think the worst of others. But there is a small part of me that likes that Im not alone and that I can talk with someone. Except that part of me is very small. I feel like talking with this therapist is just adding a different kind of stress. I mean..

6829355,0,t3_49awm9,If theres one thing about Nparents thats consistent its their inconsistency. She projected her negative feelings about her own NM onto you rather than dealing with them herself whether alone or seeking therapy. She made you feel bad about yourself basically told you that you arent allowed to make a very common lifechoice that most other people are allowed to make then turned around and decided the opposite because she wants kids in her life. Oh hell no she doesnt get to do this. Not if you recognize her chaotic emotionally abusive behavior for what it is analyze it and move past it. If you want kids someday you can have them. You are not her and she doesnt get to decide what you are and are not capable of in life. And that doesnt mean she gets to be a grandparent either.

6835706,0,t3_49e5su,I certainly did for years after I moved out. A lot of it was stuff I hadnt been taught some of it was stuff I was told I was bad at my millionaire miser Nmom liked to tell me how irresponsible I was with money starting when I was  because I liked to put it into supermarket candy and toy machines. I guess I should have been putting it into highinterest bonds idk. A lot of the stuff I was bad at I also wasnt taught to be better at so that my Nmom could continue showing off how amazing and competent she was compared with how crap and incompetent I was. This was useful in keeping me tied to her too. My fear of money issues and my sense of my own incompetence kept me financially dependent on her another reason I was a pathetic loser compared with Her Amazingness! years past the time when I might otherwise have been ready to stand on my own two feet. It really helped when I was in my s and got into a relationship with a SO who was equally broke but wasnt triggered by money in the way I was. He taught me that finances dont have to be super emotional by treating it as just math. Now Im still broke because Im a grad student but I treat budgeting as creative problem solving rather than something to freak out about. Here are a handful of Personal Finance  sites.The internet is truly a great thing for ACoNs. No matter what your parents didnt teach you how to wear makeup! how to put on a condom! how to create a realistic budget! how to resolve conflict amicably! if you want to learn theres someone out there who wants to help usually by breaking it down step by step on YouTube. ,raisedbynarcissists,d0r4nsb,3,t5_2we9n

6854791,0,t3_49lx1z,I think the first thing you need to do is consider getting away from that situation. As far away as possible if you can.  If you decide to do something about what happened the first thing that will happen is a restraining order against your dad and possibly your mom.  I came from a situation similar to yours.  I was molested by my father.  He had an obsession with me and would even talk to my mother about it frequently.  I dont remember anything sexual happening when I was younger but part of me wonders if I have repressed anything.   I ran away when I was  and my mother left my father during that time. After she left he convinced me that it was safe for me to return home. I was home a week and I came upstairs and my father was drinking by himself at the kitchen table.  He offered me a drink I took it thinking I was mature and we talked and drank.  The next thing I remember is him crying and grabbing me and kissing as he tells me how much he watched me.  In the bathroom in my bedroom moments when I thought I was my myself.  I kept telling him he should stop drinking and go to bed he kept telling me I needed to come with him.   He wouldnt let up but he disappeared for a second to go to the bathroom. So I got my shoes on and ran to my BFs house at the time.  He called and said it was nothing apologizing and crying.   During the time we were talking he admitted to talking to some of my friends online. He said the same things that your father said. That some of my friends were pretty cute. The friend of mine that he was talking to online denied ever talking to him. I took my father to court.  He got a slap on the wrist because my girlfriend wouldnt testify against him.  The happened when I was  and I was  at the time of the case.  Because of this my name was able to be published all over the case and nothing was sealed like a minors would be. I lived in a place where  is considered an adult  The lawyer at the time said I wouldnt be able to charge him because I didnt cry when they recorded my statement.  I had friends tell me that I took it too far it was my fault for drinking with him that I was a whore. I still remember the first day back at school I was graduating that year and I really wanted too because no one else in my family had their high school diploma.  My dad lies on his resume and says he does those in my family know the truth.  Anyways  I thought on the way to school that I would be okay.  It would be fine no one knows anything anyways. I wasnt at the point of talking to any police yet  As soon as I walked though the doors I was bawling. I was afraid that he would come and claim I had been missing and run away and demand that I be sent home.  I ran into my gaudence counceller thankfully.  He could tell by my face that I wasnt okay and asked that I wait in his office for him. So I did.   He was aware of what had happened. I didnt have to tell him.  The first thing he said was lisa I want you to know that it isnt your fault.  There is nothing you could have done to cause him to act that way.  No matter what clothes you wear the way you acted or who you hung out with. This isnt your fault. He was the only one thoughout the whole thing to tell me that. My dad got off scott free. He was charged with child exploitation of a minor and was sentenced to compolsery AA and banned from buying alcohol.  My younger brother who was still living with him said that it was never enforced. He is still an alcoholic.  The hardest part for me was peeking into the court room and seeing my mother holding his hand sitting on the bench waiting for the verdict.  She warned me once about him but I will never forgive her for not believeing me when I told her. I dont regret ever charging him. I dont regret talking about what happened. The only thing I regret is not getting help when I needed it. I never talked to a counsouler. I didnt have the money because I was left homeless.  I did graduate though. So  my advice to you is to leave if you can and talk. Talk your heart off. Talk to the police if you need to. Talk to a counceller or a therapist or a friend. If your friend doesnt want to talk than come on reddit and talk. Staying in the house isnt going to be good for you the only thing that will help you heal is if you remove yourself from that situation.   It has been ten years since that happened to me. I have suffered from self blame and self harm depression suicide attemts a drug habit  and homelessness because of that night.  It doesnt define me anymore.  There is a happy ending. I have a husband a house a car and two kids with one on the way.  I live on the other side of the country away from that asshole that calls himself my father. If you take anything from this know that it isnt your fault.  ,raisedbynarcissists,d0tarku,7,t5_2we9n

6863122,0,t1_d0u8bc3,Thank you! For understanding. It really means a lot. Yeah it really does hurt. It makes me confised. My mom does acknowledge I have MI. She takes me to all of these appointments. She acts like she cares about my mental being but them she makes comments like these. I was diagnosed with MI since I was . Before I knew what it really meant. This was after I came out of an extremely abusive foster care system. So of course I was still screwed up. My mom always seemed to use my MI against me too and EVERYTHING was in my head or I didnt know better or I just needed to take or change my meds when I was upset. I believe my family always saw me less as someone who needed fixing or looked down with pity. The straw was when my one sister said something offensive during Easter and I later told her how it made me feel. She said it was just a joke and that I need help and need to see a doctor. I was in counseling group therapy and seeing a psychiatrist at that time. I think being in the Mental health care made me feel crazy and maybe it was my moms goal so she could control me.

I dont ever remember hugging or snuggling with her the way she and my sister did. Or the way that I remember sitting on my aunt or dad or Grandpas lap and feeling warm and loved. My Gran is definitely a covert N. I didnt figure it out until last summer. Even after hearing stories of her weirdness for years. I was her GC and she was the only person who had ever shown me love for being me. As an adult when I think back I think that I was naturally close to her ideal of a grandchild and she molded the rest before I knew enough to fight back. I have to admit that her pride in me my manners and accomplishments gave me a lot of strength to stand up to my Nmom when I had to. They also gave me a small amount of leverage in that Nmom didnt want to look bad in front of her own or her ex husbands mom. When she was especially ridiculous and time was running out I could call my Grandmas for the final field trip payment that Nmom promised but forgot about and then couldnt afford. There was hell to pay afterward sometimes but sometimes I got to just go sing with my choir and have fun.

On personality traits have you ever seen someone you havent seen for a long time and noticed that theyve changed. Wow theyre a lot less angry than when I knew them! etc.?So yes people can turn against their immorality and they can change personality traits. BUT and heres a very big but. Consider what youre asking. Narcissists are selfcentred arrogant exploitative unempathetic needy envious controlling critical hypocritical inconsiderate and uncompromising. On top of that they do immoral acts have a lack of selfawareness and a lack of responsibility.Getting an angry person to be less angry is easier as you can gain a foothold by explaining the effect of their anger on others. Though its still far from easy. People change if they want to change not because someone else wants them to change.For example Ive successfully stopped my Dad and his wife not Ns making antihomosexual comments but they continue to make mean remarks about obese family members. Because all I got a foothold on was one topic namely gay people arent deserving of such a judgemental attitude or more cynically dont say your thoughts on gay people around me and not actually removed the judgemental attitude.Where do you even begin to gain a foothold with narcissists? It is so endemic to who they are that its more than difficult to start.

All shed have to do is fail to wash her hands after touching a peanut bar then hand you something to eatvoila foods contaminated and youre exposed all in a convenient accident.My mother actually does have some allergies and illness but I wouldnt be surprised if some of it was oneupmanship.

6980698,0,t3_4badqc,Oh sweet jesus.... I know what youre going through.... My hair was SUPER thin and fine until I hit th grade.  She decided before I started kindergarten that it was scraggly shit so she had my hair cut into this effin hideous dutchboy cut shoulder length.  No longer no shorter.  I BEGGED to grow it out because all the other little girls had long hair braids ribbons you know?  Nope.  Your hair isnt WORTH fixing.  Youd be pretty if ONLY it was thicker longer DARKER you friggin name it.Fourth grade comes along hair gets darker thicker finally something to work with!  Go for fall haircut she and the stylist come up with some HORRENDOUS style This was mid to late s if that gives you some kind of idea where Im going with this and the two of them come up with some GOD AWFUL fusion of a s shoulder length rolled under hairstyle with these s feathered bangs.  Which she thought was FABULOUS.  Shed roust me out of bed an extra hour early so she could play Beauty Salon and style this crap Monday thru Friday.  Now shes CHEAP.  NEVER wants to spend money though my parents have plenty of it but she would pay good frickin money to take me in EVERY six weeks to keep this monstrosity in A shape!  Body perms every so many months because.... well hell!  Why not polish a turd amiright?  Plus she sprang for a new blow dryer and curling irons and brushes but I wasnt allowed to touch them because I was an idiot.  So from th until the summer before th grade Im wearing this fugly do.  Because With your face shape ANYTHING other than this style just makes your face look EVEN FATTER!  Then puberty really set in and a bunch of other crap happened that meant if she kept it up making me look too pretty that Id be a whore.  Or something.  Probably a whore.  So she grudgingly decided that I could grow it out and get a spiral perm all the rage!  She hated it and made sure I knew it by constantly reminded me how flattering it was with her own CUSTOM design gags a little at the memory.  In fact she managed to wear me down so bad I forgive me for this I knew not what I did CAVED and got that cut back almost identically for my wedding.  ltPlease forgive me.gtFast forward to my mid s.  Im married Im REALLY getting sick of her crap realize no matter WHAT I do I will ALWAYS look like crap in her eyes.  Hate my hair and hubby says I think youd look super hot if you cut if off short!  I go Huh?  He repeats his idea and says Why not?  I mull it over and go Oh what the hell!  Its hair its gonna grow back besides Im still convinced Im a wildebeest but Ive got free will now so at least Ill be a wildebeest with I haircut I chose myself.  Go in tell stylist what Im thinking.  Stylist about loses it doing a happy dance.  Oh my God!!!  Youll look SO CUTE!!!!  Your face structure is gonna LOOK AWESOME!!!  I told the stylist how my mom told me anything but shoulder length styled soandso made my face look fat.  He rolls his eyes and goes Good GOD no!  What she was DOING made your face look heavy!  That was SABOTAGE!  I will NEVER forget the stylist leaning over and whispering to me Please let me cut it.... youll look awesome!  Then he whispers in a more quiet evil tone Lets piss your mom off.  So I did it.  And I got compliments ALL OVER the place about insanely awesome cheekbones I never knew I had.  And irritated the hell out of my mom.  And for the next   years until I went no contact.  Her face would go all sour anytime I would come over with a new SHORT haircut.  And shed remind me of that beautiful haircut she designed way back when.I learned a lesson that day.... Screw it.  Your head your hair.  Rebellion good.  I eventually started dabbling in the Dark Arts and began dyeing and highlighting my hair.  Didnt instantaneously turn into a hooker God hasnt struck me dead yet.  In fact I like to believe God appreciates my cheekbones.I know this is looooonnng.  But hopefully you laughed at least once.  Im sorry you feel bad about what Im sure is a fabulous head of hair.  You know what?  If you havent already tell your stylist about your nmom and your hair growing up.  Theyre a lot like therapists anyway.  Ill bet theyd LOVE to help you find ways to LOVE your hair and take back ownership of your scalp and whats growing on it.  I did that with mine and we have SO MUCH FUN with it.  Tell your stylist you want to go slow and just PLAY with it.

Her mother is the only family anywhere near us. She doesnt talk to her family because her mother has pushed the entire family out no doubt caused from N. Her mother is charging us way too much rent right now because she was mad at us and made us start paying rent and a ridiculous amount at that. So we cant afford a babysitter or know a babysitter. We dont do earlier bedtimes because nmil calls and gets pissy about it and starts with her regular stuff. The boys cant go to bed too early they cant stay up too late. Her mother literally calls her EVERY morning to make sure our  year old got to school. Its none of her business whether he got there or not.Sometimes we even try to maybe skip church on a Sunday every now and then. Get some time for ourselves and our family. But that is by far the worst thing we could ever do. We are pulling the boys out of church and teaching them wrong. They are  and . They dont know what theyre learning yet and dont care about any of it yet. But if the  year old misses church its the end of the world. Which is another issue we have with her asides from this one.

My usual way of dealing with this is by scrunching up my face and saying Eeeewww why would you sayask me something like this to me? and I say it loud enough for people around us can hear it.

Its been a long time since I saw you both.NAunt Smirks He has become fat since you last saw him.Me  loudly Nauntttttttttttt that is not a very nice thing to say!!!!!heads whipped around and people started staringMy aunt started sputtering because she didnt expect this and didnt have an come back without making herself look bad because a lot more people were interested to know what was going on. At this point cousin stepcousin and his wife started cracking up because they have never seen my aunt so speechless.Keep in mind This strategy wont work if you are a minor or still living with your Nparent  You will need a safe place to retreat quickly. It is also effective when there are outsiders present and your N is covert and is invested in having a good public image  Otherwise they just might follow you screaming and hurling insults. Do not try this if they have a history of being physically violent because they will make you pay for humiliating them.,raisedbynarcissists,d1ak15s,9,t5_2we9n

7015978,0,t1_d1beo4l,This really sucks and it feels really unfair it is really but you need to work harder at this than him. Until he understands what it is to be an ACoN.As the spouse I can say that it really felt unfair how my GF treated me. I felt trapped and helpless since I could never help her and anything I said was useless or hurtful. I was never good enough for her. Until I finally understood the real meaning behind her words and actions. Your FLEAS are probably hurting him but you are not doing this to hurt him its a veiled message shouting help me. You just dont realise yourself whenever you act like this.Your realisation is the first step and changing and healing! is very possible. At the begining me and my GF had a lot of shouting matches because of this. The most important thing is to really confide in him. He may be right that you are acting like your mother. I mean shes the one who raised you so you learned how to act andd defend yourself from her! This takes some time to change. You dont want to act like her or be like her tell him that and tell him that it really hurts when you do so.When you argue and you realise that your argument was fueled by your FLEAS dont hesitate to go to him afterwards or whenever you realise it and apologize to him and explain why you felt like that. It really really helped me when my GF came to me to admit that this shouting match was because she brooded the whole day about her mom and when I left the dishes on the floor after watching TV it wasnt the end of the world... just a spark to burst the gasfilled tank of her emotions.If you manage to make sense when you are angry or sad or helpless because of your FLEAS you will probably also get better at knowing when you are just plain mad about stuff that matter and you will be able to tell him with confidence No Im not projecting. Youre a douche right now.If you never had therapy it can really help you out to set up some ground work to get back in control of your mind. It really is crappy but dont be too angry with you SO. Its really unfair but he doesnt understand. If you feel that he loves you and dont let your anxiety or depression do the thinking about that! he will end up coming around.

7030773,0,t3_4bw4e6,Although many people do have difficulties with their parents when young which later get ironed out if bad days are the norm then something is wrong. Your parents should nurture a loving and caring environment where you feel safest. You shouldnt wake up expecting to have a traumatic day.Honestly the importance of mental health cannot be underestimated. The longterm damage to your mental health living in an environment where you feel trapped and miserable can pass unnoticed at the time as it takes place gradually.If there is any way of deferring your entry to uni for a year  or longer going to uni in your twenties is actually quite cool as you are old enough to not feel the peer pressure but still young enough to party if you want to  in order to give yourself more options then I believe its something that is worth exploring. Making independent decisions that you know wont be approved of can seem quite daunting but it really is a lot easier than it may seem and I am sure that many on here myself included will be willing to offer any advice or guidance you need.,raisedbynarcissists,d1dajda,1,t5_2we9n

7048395,0,t1_d1fakc8,Continuedgt Shes exploitative. She will manipulate to get work money or objects she envies out of other people for nothing. This includes her children of course. If she set up a bank account for you she was trustee on the account with the right to withdraw money. As you put money into it she took it out. She may have stolen your identity. She took you as a dependent on her income taxes so you couldnt file independently without exposing her to criminal penalties.She hasnt set anything up for me so I cant say anything about this part.gtIf she made an agreement with you it was violated the minute it no longer served her needs. If you brought it up demanding she adhere to the agreement she brushed you off and later punished you so you would know not to defy her again. I havent made any agreements but she does preach her morals to me but never upholds them when it comes to herself unless its towards someone shes not exploiting.gtSometimes the narcissist will exploit a child to absorb punishment that would have been hers from an abusive partner. The husband comes home in a drunken rage and the mother immediately complains about the childs bad behavior so the rage is vented on to the child. Sometimes the narcissistic mother simply uses the child to keep a sick marriage intact because the alternative is being divorced or having to go to work. The child is sexually molested but the mother never notices or worse calls the child a liar when she tells the mother about the molestation. I cant say anything about this part. My father is entirely stable and my stepmother has no enemies.gt She projects. This sounds a little like psychobabble but it is something that narcissists all do. Projection means that she will put her own bad behavior character and traits on you so she can deny them in herself and punish you. This can be very difficult to see if you have traits that she can project on to. An eatingdisordered woman who obsesses over her daughters weight is projecting. The daughter may not realize it because she has probably internalized an absurdly thin vision of womens weight and so accepts her mothers projection. When the narcissist tells the daughter that she eats too much needs to exercise more or has to wear extralarge size clothes the daughter believes it even if it isnt true. However she will sometimes project even though it makes no sense at all. This happens when she feels shamed and needs to put it on her scapegoat child and the projection therefore comes across as being an attack out of the blue. For example She makes an outrageous request and you casually refuse to let her have her way. Shes enraged by your refusal and snarls at you that youll talk about it when youve calmed down and are no longer hysterical. Im not really that observant so Im not certain if this occurs or not. Im pretty sure it doesnt but I could be wrong.gtYou arent hysterical at all she is but your refusal has made her feel the shame that should have stopped her from making shameless demands in the first place. Thats intolerable. She can transfer that shame to you and rationalize away your response you only refused her because youre so unreasonable. Having done that she can reassert her shamelessness and indulge her childish willfulness by turning an unequivocal refusal into a subject for further discussion. Youll talk about it again later  probably when shes worn you down with histrionics pouting and the silent treatment so youre more inclined to do what she wants. Im not sure about the first part as I cant read her mind. However she definitely wears me down pouts and gives the silent treatment. gt She is never wrong about anything. No matter what shes done she wont ever genuinely apologize for anything. Instead any time she feels she is being made to apologize she will sulk and pout issue an insulting apology or negate the apology she has just made with justifications qualifications or self pity Im sorry you felt that I humiliated you Im sorry if I made you feel bad If I did that it was wrong Im sorry but I theres nothing I can do about it Im sorry I made you feel clumsy stupid and disgusting Im sorry but it was just a joke. Youre so oversensitive Im sorry that my own child feels she has to upset me and make me feel bad. The last insulting apology is also an example of projection. The majority of the time she wont but she will do this sometimes. However nothing changes and the cycle simply continues.gt She seems to have no awareness that other people even have feelings. Shell occasionally slip and say something jawdroppingly callous because of this lack of empathy. It isnt that she doesnt care at all about other peoples feelings though she doesnt. It would simply never occur to her to think about their feelings. An absence of empathy is the defining trait of a narcissist and underlies most of the other traits I have described. Unlike psychopaths narcissists do understand right wrong and consequences so they are not ordinarily criminal. She beat you but not to the point where you went to the hospital. She left you standing out in the cold until you were miserable but not until you had hypothermia. She put you in the basement in the dark with no clothes on but she only left you there for two hours. She tends to be very unaware of other peoples emotions. Rather she seems to judge by visuals only which she happens to be extremely perceptive in. She has never done anything severe in terms of punishments although she has threatened to do so.Continued below,raisedbynarcissists,d1fakn3,1,t5_2we9n
7054398,0,t1_d1fxkv5,Im not even asking my mother to acknowledge what shes done in the past just stop bringing it up and stop being abusive. At this point Im NC with my mother and LC with my father as a result of some chaos that happened at Christmas. Things had been going very well until she spontaneously erupted into openly mocking me for believing Id been abused as a child. I set a boundary she ignored it so we left. Her communication with me since has consisted of a single very angry voicemail about a different matter and using one of my sisters as a proxy for a futile battle over some old home movies. I dont think shes necessarily narcissistic because I think at some level she realizes she did something wrong. If she didnt realize she made mistakes I dont think shed feel the need to constantly bring it up and justify her past actions when no one else was discussing it. I think theres a voice in the back of her head reminding her of all the evil things that shes done and because she has real trouble separating her internal monologue and her fears from reality she ends up exploding in  efforts to defend herself.,raisedbynarcissists,d1fz40t,4,t5_2we9n

No ones perfect if you drive a car you will likely have some minor incidents over the decades  like this one.  You didnt total her car or the other one nobody was hurt.  And as you gain experience the likelihood of this kind of thing decreases  its not like youre going to have one accident after another.Treat this as an opportunity.  If she comes unhinged overreacts you CAN say Now Mom nobody was hurt and insurance covers the vehicles.  Im not making light of my responsibility.  I AM refusing to be treated like shit because I had a minor accident. Stick to I statements rather than you statements.  Remain calm even when you feel scared  in fact its OK to say I feel scared because of how Im being treated for a minor car accident.  I came and told you about it and I take responsibility.  If we have a deductible or our premiums go up Ill pay.  But I am not going to be treated like its the end of the world.  You know mom it would actually help if Im not treated like I have to be perfect.  You must be prepared to back up your word do what you must legitimately to ensure that you can pay if costs result and VERIFY by talking directly to the insurance agent if youre told that the premium increases.  Its OK to be scared  to feel what you feel.  Part of becoming an adult is allowing yourself your feelings while doing the right thing.  EDIT Tell her because shes gonna find out anyway  the company or the agent will contact her.  Waiting just gives her more to abuse you with.  And youre not an idiot.

7069378,0,t3_4ceymq,I have some issues with all these articles.  Like all the idealize stuff fits my ex wife perfectly... and she is not a narcissist at all closer to Borderline personality disorder.  like the part about mirroring.  Thats definitely a dysfunctional thing but its not narcissistic at all.  Its IS something narcs often do because they are dysfunctional but it has nothing to do with narcissism.  All of these things can fit in with people having intimacy problems.  For example many articles will say that people will often denigrate or insult someone as a distancing tactic.  Its also very common that the article will say that the insult is said with a smile to confuse you.  I saw this with my ex wife we would get along for a couple weeks and after many years i finally got to where I would expect her to start being insulting to me after a couple weeks.  The very last time i even told her ive been waiting all this week for you to zing me like that I knew it was coming.   Then she would be much nicer because I woudl back away from her emotionallyShe is not a narc at all.  She was pushing me away as i wanted to get closer to her.  The hoovering happened if i pulled away too much got angry or started ignoring her out of my anger.  She wanted me to keep my distance... but didnt want me to leave.  So she would try to push me away but if I moved too far for her to feel i was still hooked on her she would get very nice.  It wasnt some sneaky cycle it was just her wanting someone but not being able to tolerate them being that close.  The common denominator is that people who act like this grew up associating people that were close to them being painful to deal with.  Its IMO a survival tactic.  I think the word narcissist is tossed around too easily this sub should really be called raisedbyabusers.  And this narc cycle of abuse IMO is really just the same thing as the normal cycle.  ,raisedbynarcissists,d1hodek,5,t5_2we9n

I even remember asking some if I could move in with them dont call CPS on parents or anything like that but where I could come live with them and this was when I was a teen worked and made As and Bs in school. I was turned down FLAT. One aunt I lived with for  months dont remember when I was sent there but I was around age  and I remember begging to stay I was free of abuse and got along with my aunt and her new baby and husband. My narc brother even reminded me last year that there was this huge controversy because I did not want to come home and it made my mother really angry. The woman hated me why not just leave me with my aunt? I guess it had to do with appearances really. They all turned their backs on me. That aunt was young then so have some forgiveness for her buty I wonder why no one ever defended me? Even their bailing out on not being there for me with my disabilities it was enough. Im done. One thing I am older and in my mid to late s. Dont waste time on the extended family or any of the rest of them. I wasted time trying to find my niche in a place I never was going to be allowed in and allowed myself to be treated bad for too many years.

For most of my life I had no idea why except how frustrating she was to deal with. Were NC now by my doing because eventually I learned how the real world works and she was the only one left that I am shitty to anymore.My behavior good or bad was never reacted to with a level of consistency. I got grounded for four As and two Bs on a report card. Most of my good behavior and grades were just effort to stem her madness. It didnt work but it taught me to get good at forging report cards thank kinkos and spinning solid lies. Shes the only person I lie to out of necessity. Not that it makes a difference.I would spend hours putting together and rehearsing fool proof lies. My friends and sometimes even their parents helped. I cant lie on a dime but spent hours spinning a good lie tight. She was a stalkerroom raiderinvestigator type. The only way she could know the truth was if she was actively spying on me which she did. She would just say she had eyes in the back of her head or was psychic. She also had flying monkeys. It was a sport. I had to lie about inconsequential shit but only because I knew shed flip out and punish me because dealing with the actual consequences of doing something wrong were never enough.Apologies for derailing. Yes my family wrote me off for being just like her because I would turn her shit into a public scene rather than just leaving it her whisper. One good reason was the only example of reactions or coping I had were from the crazy shit she would say and do behind closed doors.

It will get stressful but if you both just stick through it itll all work out. If youre in the Tampa Bay area or somewhere nearby and youre lonely or something Id be glad to hang out. Im pretty young f but I understand a lot of the struggles of being raised by an N. You are beautiful you are strong and you can do this hun. Focus on whats important your relationship with your boyfriend your job or school stuff like that. I know that might not be helpful because its so hard not to focus on the most distressing thing which is your family but please please stuck through and it will get better.

And ditch the tracked phone and get yourself a cheap payasyougo phone that shes not connected to. If she starts in with berating or yelling at you you just say Sorry mom I have to go. Well talk when you feel better. Or whatever grey rock version works for the situation. I totally agree with the others keep yourself independent for the weekend and dont agree to let her drive you. Edited to add Sorry if I came across a little strident your post really touched a nerve for me. This kind of manipulation is still hard for me to deal with even after years of practice. I hope your graduation days are great and stressfree.,raisedbynarcissists,d1uskhx,1,t5_2we9n
7186434,0,t3_4duusp,Yeah.  I suffer with hyper vigilance as one part but Nrents made it a point to constantly tell me from little on that No one likes you everybody hates you theyre just putting up with you they just allow you around because they feel sorry for you if they knew what a lousy person you really are they wouldnt want you around anymore.  So now I tend to believe people hate me or are just putting up with me.  And any time anyone is sadmad I think its because I did something.Whats helped?   counseling  being honest with those Im closest to and explaining things  the minute I start thinking those thoughts I mentally tell myself to shut up and then apply logic You know these people... they dont put up with crap.  You think if they didnt like you theyd just tolerate it?  This is your Nmom talking not you.  Then I list  things my loved onefriend has told me they like about me.  If its a stranger or coworker I simply apply the logic that This person doesnt even know me.  They cannot have formed an opinion of me yet.  If they have then its an uninformed one.  Not my problem.If its me picking up on someone elses emotions I firmly remind myself that feeling isnt ownership.  Yes this person is experiencing an emotion.  Its NOT MINE.  And I use logic again  This person is mad.  Then give myself two or three valid reasons NOT RELATED TO ME why they might be upset car wouldnt start wrong coffee at coffee shop underwear to tight whatever and LET IT GO.  If its someone I have some relationship with where I feel they are open to discussing it Pro at this since Im hyper vigilant Ill say something along the lines of You seem angrysadappropriate emotion.  Is something wrong?  And generally people will tell you.  And youll find that overwhelmingly its NOT RELATED TO YOU.  Ive found that doing this has reinforced my new beliefs and reduced my stress and worries.  Plus I have then talked to someone created some rapport because I honestly do care and I have made a tiny connection.I am not a therapist so your mileage may vary.  ,raisedbynarcissists,d1v1ang,1,t5_2we9n

7190952,0,t3_4dwy1a,For years I just thought. Meh my family and I just dont get along thats all. The only reason I have all these emotional and mental issues is because Im wired wrong or something.It wasnt until at the age of  when my ex sat me down and said You were abused that I started to question things and really scrutinize and critically analyze my history. Finally by age  I realized that it was abuse and the moment it dawned on me I sobbed hysterically. I sobbed for the little girl and teenager who deserved to be loved unconditionally but wasnt.This is normal OP. You are allowed to grieve what youve never had and to feel devastation over the way that child was mistreated. Its okay. Its healthy and normal. The first step is realizing it right? Accepting it and deciding what to do to heal. You will be okay OP. Ill grieve with you. YOU are valid and always have been. ,raisedbynarcissists,d1vjtup,4,t5_2we9n

This will go away as you become colder and colder. But I really advice to quit doing that because it is an incentive that will condition her to keep up with all this intolerable behavior.You dont need to dig deep on Pavlovian conditioning its basically training a dog to do something by giving him a tendie every time he does it. Negative pavlov is to break the dog of a habit by punishing him every time he attempts it. Thats it actually.About your future Im not from the US so I cant really help.

7215658,0,t1_d1x5c7y,First off you have a ton of selfawareness and thats a good thing.  You know exactly where youre hurting yourself now all you need to do is make some changes.Yes I mean no negative selfspeak.  This is coming from a guy who was  years old and going to jump out of a window headfirst then told himself nah youd probably fuck that up too and end up paralyzed and just be a burden on everyone.  You owe it to yourself to be better than that.  We all do.You dont need to check yourself.  Rephrase everything into something positive.  Im going to remember my wallet tomorrow is so much more useful than youre gonna forget your fucking wallet.  What we think about ourselves becomes selffulfilling.  Youre gonna forget your wallet dumbass gt See you forgot your fucking wallet again gt youre never gonna remember shit gt why even try im just gonna disappoint myself.Im gonna remember my wallet more gt Hey I remembered it! gt I can remember things gt Im getting better.  As dumb as it sounds give yourself an attaboy every time you notice that you have your wallet in your goddamn pocket.  Before you know it youll be happy when you remember your wallet in the morning and getting ready for work will suddenly be this positive Im making progress I have my shit together thing.  Then youll start looking for your wallet in the morning because it makes you happy that youre remembering more and more and thatll make you remember it more and so on.As you do this remember that everybody makes mistakes.  Dont beat yourself up just say mistakes happen and Ill try again tomorrow.  You wont get out of check youll actually improve.  It may sound dumb or impossibly simple but try it for a couple of weeks whats the worst that can happen?From a scientific perspective what were talking about is neural pathways and neural plasticity.  Youre currently stuck in thought traps that are unhealthy to your overall self.  Your physical brain wires itself to transmit these thoughts more easily because you have more traffic on those neural highways.Youve essentially built a neural superhighway for negative thoughts and your self affirmative and optimistic thoughts are held up on back roads.  But the good news is that you can retrain your brain.  The more you exercise new thought patterns the more neural connections will be formed to carry them.  Youll literally become more efficient at optimism and affirmation.I have no idea what to say to you in order to motivate you to try but Im asking you to try this as a personal favor.  Give it three months.  Start with your wallet.  Try to stay positive about it.  Check the negative thoughts and when you catch yourself thinking one give yourself an attaboy for noticing it.Then take a deep breath and think about something that makes you happy and carry that feeling with you for a minute.  Then go about your day.  Circle back in July and see if the quality of your life has improved.  I know it sounds impossibly simple and maybe a little stupid but give it three months.  Theres nothing to lose and everything to gain.Regarding being in control of ones emotions I dont mean repressing them or withdrawing from them.  Youre already good at that but you also know its painful.  The area in which you can improve lies in the ability to feel all the emotions that come to you but recognize them for what they are and not let them push you around.Establishing good emotional boundaries is a part of healthy adulthood.  We can feel empathy for people but without making their problems our own.  We can feel frustrated at our mistakes but without it impacting our overall happiness.What we tend to do is the opposite  we catch each others feelings and make them our own.  It is not necessary and it becomes quickly overwhelming leading us to withdrawal and repression of our own emotions.  I think a pretty common characteristic of ACONs is that were EXPECTED to share our NParents happiness outrage anger sadness etc.  If we dont reflect their emotions back to them they perceive it as us not caring enough and they punish us for it.So we go about life observing and reflecting collecting peoples burdens and adding them to ours.  Walk in the house and NMom is in a bad mood?  I guess Im in a bad mood too.We dont have to do that.  We can learn to be empathetic and helpful and supportive but also acknowledge that other peoples struggles are their own and were under no obligation to be anything other than happy.Listen man I dont know you and I dont know if any of this is on target for your situation.  But I care about you and I hope this helps in some small way.  You can do it brother.  ,raisedbynarcissists,d1yd4e6,1,t5_2we9n

He may have subconsciously felt like his control of you was slipping because things were calm so he invented drama to keep control over you.An old lecture I heard put it bestNormal people live lives of calm with occasional moments of crisis.Dysfunctional people live lives of crisis with occasional moments of calm. Your father probably didnt like the calm so he destroyed it. He got his nsupply so he didnt care that you smashed it because you enjoying it was never the goal  the whole purpose was kicking you in the gut emotionally. He just wanted to manufacture a reason to imply that you were a rotten kid  and thats exactly what he did. Pretty fucked up right? Think back about moments of calm and those moments being destroyed by crisis and drama from your father. See if theres a pattern there. I bet there is. My father did that constantly  we could never get comfortable because the moment he saw that hed do something to upset that.

If possible I would advise making plansarrangements regarding accomodation etc. now. Depending on when you turn  if you can drag your heels long enough you definitely couldnt be forced to return with your parents. Could you share a house with friends? My advice is to look at your options and come up with a plan. Call into your local Citizens Advice Bureau theres at least one in every decentsized town in the UK and ask to speak to an advisor. Tell them what youve written here. If the abuse escalates do not be afraid to get in touch with Social Services. They will help you.

7310028,0,t3_4fh2v0,At the beginning of a school year my ex husband was listed erroneously on the contact list for emergencies. Unfortunately due to poor wording it automatically signed him up for robocalls when my children were absent which would lead to a shit show even when it was just school announcements about upcoming early release days. He deliberately misunderstood the calls swearing they were about absences that never took place and wed have enraged screaming matches about ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.It took several trips to the school to get his name off the robo call list as the computer system in the district they attended was pure fuckery. Finally when I mentioned the mental distress the children were under and how I might end up being able to fix this by getting a court order after recommendations from their therapists and pediatrician they called in someone better at navigating the system and got that shit taken care of THAT MOMENT.Have your parents been given permission by you to go to the school to pick him up visit or receive calls regarding his situation? No? Then the school fucked up big time.If the person is NOT a custodial parent they cannot just go in and get information. Its that simple like everyone here is saying.Is your child in the best school of its kind in the area? No? View this as an opportunity. Get a lawyer discuss this and use this new threat and violation of privacy to remove him to a better school even if there are zoning issues preventing him from attending prior to this. You no longer feel safe knowing that unauthorized people have been given unfettered access to your child without your permission. Seriously after the field trip what was going to happen? Were they going to say Oh we are going that way we can take him home? So THEN what?

Have someone else actually talk to your father? For that sum of cash youre probably going to want a professional to oversee the dealings and make sure any paperwork is in order. Im sure theyve encountered family members who do not wish to speak with one another.At the very least you could say just mail a check and be done with it. You might try asking rfinancialadvice ifhow you can receive a lump sum of money from someone without ever actually interacting with them.As long as you dont actually have to deal with your father and you carefully check the paperwork to make sure there are no strings I say fucking go for it.

She keeps buying stuff that I do not like and will never use since we have a very different taste and than keeps nagging me to take it.

7399622,0,t1_d2iz7d4,Well I say we might because my boyfriend has brought it up a few times and has told me that he would rather me live with him than with my mother. Ive lived on my own with roommates for  years but I had to move home because I couldnt pay my rent on my . an hour salary and transferred schools. I stay at his apartment more than my mothers house  anyway. I think I am worthy of being committed to. I just have to prove it. He made a valid point when he asked me if I would marry myself. It made me think of what I really need to fix about myself. He has trust issues with me as well because I fucked up when we were on a break. I hooked up with an ex and didnt right out tell him all the details and lied because I didnt want to hurt him. That was  years ago. We tried  times to officially end things but he always came back. But I definitely need to be away from that environment my therapist said that the sooner the better even though Im not financially stable at the moment to do so. I just hate having these outbursts of craziness and I feel like I cant control my emotions for anything. Ive said a lot of mean and hurtful things to my boyfriend when I get like that. Thankfully the insults have stopped. I also suffer from anxiety and depression. Im so grateful to have my boyfriend because he sees what my mom is and he just doesnt want me to be like that and I dont either. He helps me a lot and the fact that hes still been here after all of this means a lot. I just dont think he sees it that way a lot of the time he says hes dumb for staying but he does it because he loves me. So as of right now Im just focused on finishing college so I can get out. ,raisedbynarcissists,d2jaduw,1,t5_2we9n

7420158,0,t1_d2li4gs,Well you didnt come from it but you certainly can have a happy family in the future. And it doesnt have to be cookiecutter or nuclear to be happy but Im sure you knew that! One of the best things about RBN is seeing people like you and me go on to have their own healthy families. Im not sure if I even want kids but just knowing that people who grew up in unhappy families can be happy parents of happy children is a really healing thing to see happen. Not that a family of choice can or is supposed to replace your family of origin. But as you surround yourself with people who love you healthfully and as you learn to love yourself you can let go of the hope that one day your mother will learn to love you healthfully. It hurts so much to let go of that false hope I know. Youre struggling because youre trying to hold onto it I think and thats normal so forgive yourself for having a hard time. I got a lot of peace from ritualizing it in my culture Jewish we light a special candle when a loved one dies or on the anniversary of their death and while my Nmom is still alive I needed to mourn the mom she couldnt be. Maybe you can do something similar? When youre ready that is. It doesnt give you final closure but it helps you mark your sorrow as something tangible and your healing as something connected to your traditions and culture. ETA and dont underestimate the power of mentorship. You might find a lot of surrogate mothers and father figures as you go through your young adulthood especially if you go into mentorshipheavy professions law medicine arts education and so on. And mentorship is this wonderful thing where you are learning from that person that person is supposed to catch you when you fall and nurture you when youre vulnerable and...its a lot like having a proper parent if youre lucky.

7432986,0,t1_d2n282q,Honestly the weirdest thing is that being in an actual relationship with real intimacy was a trigger.That level of vulnerability brought out the most intense flashbacks from being a child that I had far repressed.I would go as far as to say that I avoided commitment or intimacy with anyone for a good chunk of my twenties for that exact reason. I would settle for long distance relationships and went for unavailable people I could never get close to. And so for the first two years I was deeply enmeshed codependent and regularly triggered into dissociating or random bouts of sobbing for  minutes because my partner didnt cuddle me when I needed. There were also a few complete breakdowns for hoursdays. One in particular sticks out. We had gotten into an argument on my birthday also a trigger and I was so aroused hyperventilating and in such a rage that I wanted to physically hurt him. Moments before I was begging him not to leave me. But hurting someone else especially someone who I love so dearly is not something I felt I could do. So I turned it on myself and scratched my arm to the point of blood still have the scar. That helped to bring me back. Months later we had taken a very low contact month long break and were talking for the first time. Feeling like Id made progress I decided right then and there to speak about that moment and try to forgive him for hurting me so badly that day. I was feeling very safe with him.And so I started to tell him about it. How I was over it and I kind of understood.And then something magnificent happened.I suddenly felt reconnected to my body. Not my usual dissociation but clear connection to the moment and the memory. He didnt actually do anything. He hadnt intentionally tried to hurt me. He was simply expressing his feelings and frustration and trying to get through to me. And I had spent that entire fight invalidating him and telling him his feelings were wrong. And so he disconnected. And that triggered me back into a memory.I was . I had done something wrong. My mom kept yelling. Telling me she was gunna have them take me away. Telling me I fucked up beyond repair and she didnt want to keep me anymore. I was begging her not to send me away. Crying sobbing eventually hyperventilating and hiccuping through sobs. This lasted at least  minutes before she comforted me. Those twenty minutes felt like eternity. Then she told me that she used to hyperventilate when she was a kid too and that its normal. And then there was a release and suddenly I felt light as a feather and told my partner I loved him and that everything was okay. ,raisedbynarcissists,d2n30hc,3,t5_2we9n
7433610,0,t3_4h3cjj,Are you me?  Weird killing me softly moment reading this.I would say from what youve said that your Nmum is parentifying you. Shes forcing you to act as her emotional supply not using the word support here because what shes doing to you is onesided forceful and probably beyond what a person in distress would require simply to feel supported. You said that before you went NC you were spending hours on the phone listening to her nursing her emotionally and this is not something she asks from your siblings.Im assuming that as you say your siblings do not do this for her because they are not required to. If your situation is at all similar to my own it may be that your Nmum acts as the martyr with your siblings doing things for them taking on all kinds of responsibilities and they are more helpless while you have been very independent and selfsufficient from an early age through your Nmums obligation. I wonder if she then uses her lengthy phone conversations with you to complain about what she has to do for everyone else and how badly everyone treats her. This is certainly something my Nmum would do when I lived away she would complain about how horribly my brothers were treating her and ask me to speak to them about their laziness when she was sick. When I would speak to them it would turn out that she had seriously exaggerated and misrepresented the truth.While you are behaving she will keep pushing your boundaries dumping on you and forcing you to look after her. At the same time she may feel threatened by your independence. This may be why she is representing you as uncaring and horrible towards her. Does she tell you what her friends and family think about you? My Nmum does the same exaggerationsstraight up lies and will use these in arguments saying that my familyher friends are disgusted with me and ready to come over and knock heads together etc. I would imagine this is a manipulation tactic on behalf of your Nmum.Whatever you give her it wont be enough. And there isnt a point where you tick all the boxes of good behaviour and she starts acting in a caring kind way towards you so you can relax. My Nmum has alternated GCSG between my two brothers and I all our lives and there has never been a time even when Ive been trying my hardest to please her and support her when there wasnt a risk that she could turn at any moment. Ultimately the Ngame of making you think that if you just figure out what they want and give it to them theyll be good to you is BS. Theyre always going to make you feel shitty no matter how much you try to give them.Really proud of you for taking that NC step maintaining your independence in the first place and all your efforts to work through years of emotional manipulation.

NC with toxic people can be great but losing the other people in your life who you love ... it gets complicated and its not fair. I think its so easy from the outside to just think its black and white cut off the toxic people. No one can know what its like for you to lose your sister and nephew.Even though its hard now and you will still face struggles when you focus on the immediate family of yourself and your husband and build a community around you in a healthy way eventually you will find its been a few months since you even thought of them and youll think Ive been pretty happy without thinking about them.

I think if you just go out on your own with no support there is a high chance you will cave and go back to what is familiar to you.

7496224,0,t3_4i1fqz,It depends who you are talking to though.  A narc or someone else with other issues may accuse you of being defensive even when you are debating calmly and logically.  Some narcs use the defensive card to throw you off andor to belittle you for disagreeing.  Unfortunately growing up with this constant negative feedback can make Acons feel more vulnerable when asserting themselves and so some of us do tend to feel overly emotional and thus defensive.I still occasionally go into a blur or fog when debating but I remind myself that the person Im speaking with isnt likely to be as invested in my subjugation or humiliation as I automatically assume and thus Im actually risking less from the encounter and yes standing up to a boss or superior is less scary than wrenching my six year old psyche.The trick is to try to objectively view the encounter and if you are indeed not being defensive calmly state that you disagree and would like to return to discussing the issue at hand.  However another Acon tendency seems to be to overjustify a decision or opinion.  It takes some experience to realize that most decisions dont require much or any explanation.  The average acquaintance doesnt care why you bought black jeans instead of blue for example.  Instead of stating XYZ just X might be fine or nothing at all especially after the argument has been won.  Surely Im not the only Acon to retroactively justify a decision!  oh yeah since we all agree because of X well heres YZ just in case its a trap...nope its done nobody really cares and move on!  ,raisedbynarcissists,d2ua55l,6,t5_2we9n

7497138,0,t3_4i21dn,When adults show traits that are normal in young children no empathy poor impulse control magical thinking poor insight in actionconsequence logic selfcentred etc. they are disordered. NPD traits are things that are abnormal in adults because they are found in people who were arrested in their mentalemotional development somewhere during their childhood.Childrens brains are still developing. In the beginning they cant do certain things because the brain regions that allow you to do things like impulse control and empathy are still under construction and arent ready to fully function. Brains develop when you nurture them. That means the brain needs nutrients and rest but also stimuli interaction with the outside world examples of behaviour things that other people teach them etc.. Good nutrients and stimuli help a brain to develop into a healthy brain.Part of your childs behaviour is normal behaviour for a child his age and with proper guidance hell develop and grow out of it. However you are right to be somewhat worried as part of his behaviour will be learned. Take the screaming for example. Its normal for a young child to be distressed when a toy cant be found and because a child is still learning to regulate their emotions distress comes out the first way that bubbles up. At the age of  its usually something they have picked up somewhere along the way already. Either your son picked it up from another adult or child or he started with screaming and has not yet learned alternatives.Its okay to be upset over a misplaced toy. Its not okay to scream at people. Its okay to punch a pillow or scream in a pillow to blow off some steam. Being upset is something you need to get through and once you air out some of the upset emotions youll notice that youre able to think clearer and are able to think of solutions that can help you deal with the situation that made you upset. emotional regulation in a nutshellYour son will pick up bad behaviour from his father. That cant be helped. Regardless its your job as a parent to help him develop skills like emotional regulation empathy problem solving etc. in an ageappropriate way. It will be hard with a narcissistic partner but you can still apply good parenting. There are good books that offer tools that can help I like Parent Effectiveness Training by Thomas Gordon and How to Talk So Kids Will Listen amp Listen So Kids Will Talk by Adele Faber. You may still get some use out of How Toddlers Thrive by Tovah Klein but that book focusses on behaviour of  to yearolds.I hope it reassures you that in part your sons behaviour is normal. By offering the right stimuli good parenting you can guide your sons development in the right direction. It will help when you can create a home environment where bad behaviour is not tolerated and good behaviour is modelled but that would most likely require divorce. This is under the assumption that your husband is abusive in a way based on you saying hes a narcissist. A good environment half the time is better than constant exposure to abuse.Im not a healthcare professional though. If you are really worried consult with a healthcare professional that specialises in child development.,raisedbynarcissists,d2udw4y,3,t5_2we9n

When we got married at the end of  I was able to pick him up on my dental insurance and we were able to get his dentures and mouth fixed.  The problem was we had to wait a month from the initial appointment.  By the time we came down to the last two weeks he was in such horrible pain that I was honestly afraid to go to work for fear he might harm himself to get out of pain.

Theyd left their home at  a.m. and driven all night we live several states apart because they wanted to help me.  Not for any gain but just to help me out.  Thats how a normal family works.  My mom?

7535026,0,t3_4ik29v,I tried for a long time. I kept thinking that the problem was me that there was some way to avoid setting off Nmom that one day my reasoning would get through to her and all of her enablers.About  years ago NY my therapist at the time told me that my attempts at repairing the relationship were futile.  I didnt want to believe this at first but Ive come to see that its really true.  A hallmark of Ns is that they are in a persistent dysfunctional pattern that has gotten them what they want all their lives and really isnt likely to ever change.  I can accept Nmom and all of her enablers for who they are but I realize more and more that the healthier I get emotionally the less I can stomach being around them.  They dont respect boundaries.  They want things to go back to the way they were before I realized how toxic they are.  My eyes are open and theres no going back.Edit  I should also add that a big part of Nmoms schtick is forgive and forget  I.e. if I could just get over the past then the problem would be solved.  The thing that Nmom and her flying monkeys dont understand is that the emotional abuse is ongoing.  Its not something that happened only in the past.  E.g. They dont understand that its NOT OK to use guilt manipulation and coercion to control people.  Theres really no reasoning with people who dont understand what a healthy relationship looksfeels like.,raisedbynarcissists,d2yp21a,8,t5_2we9n

Abuse survivors especially people who are still in the abusive relationships cant heal on anyone elses schedule but their own. Support him but let him determine what he thinks about this. Abuse particularly the abuse tactic called gaslighting stops people from owning their own experiences feelings and perceptions. The most supportive thing you can do is back him up when he says something about his mom has made him uncomfortable  let him know that the relationship is messed up but HE isnt that hes not crazy or a bad son that boundaries are healthy  but dont substitute your assessment of his relationship with his mom for your own.Yes I do think this is abuse. It might not be sexual abuse but its emotional abuse which is the core of all abuse. If your father hits you it hurts more than if a stranger hits you just as hard. I cant say for sure though. But things dont have to get to the level of abuse for them to be VERY BAD.If hes uncomfortable with her transgressions of his boundaries thats enough for it to be a bad relationship. It doesnt have to be abusive. And he doesnt have to realize its abuse in order to start healing from it.

This kind of stunt is why I feel like the sky is falling when Im relying on anyone other than myself.Ive had to jump through many hoops as I like to say to pay my own intuition. Neither parent contributed anything. I got rejected by banks for a line of credit until I went to my moms bank where they knew her and knew me and were willing to take a chance on me even without a cosigner. They requested that I take life insurance for the amount of the loan. This was a small part of the solution though. I qualified for federal and provincial loans and for some University grants. All of it put together was enough for me to get by. I think I started every school year not being sure where the money would come from to complete the school year. I just pushed forward and met with the financial department of the school to make them aware of the situation and find out what all my options were as far ahead of time as possible. This was not in the states and Im sure each UniversityCollege is different anyway but my University claimed to have some of their own emergency loan programs to help students in a bind outside of the established provincial and federal loans.

7628570,0,t3_4jsqzp,The difference of opinion part becomes abusive when only one persons opinion is ever allowed.  Which is somewhat separate from gas lighting but worth the explanation I think.The way youve written this you allow for the fact that different people have different experiences and will remember different aspects of the same events.  Most people would agree.  Your typical narcissist would not.  My dad for example.  The ONLY reality is HIS reality.  Whatever seems true to him based not only on facts but on his own personal perspective attitude opinions etc. should be equally and obviously true to everyone else.  He punished us for expressing differences of opinion down to which flavor of icecream is better than another.  The gas lighting part would be all the times that hes said he never spanked us unless we really deserved it when in reality we were paddled for saying I like Coke better than Pepsi.  But then if he truly believes thats a valid reason for beating a child hes not gas lighting right?  But I digress.Punishing another person for daring to say they recall something differently thats abusive.  It might not truly be gaslighting though for whatever thats worth.But the main thing I was going to say is that I dont think its always for us as outsiders to say who is a gaslighting abuser.  My problem with the concept seems to be theres an unspoken decision at some point of whose emotions are valid and whose are not and whoevers on the losing side is a gaslighting abuser.Essentially Im agreeing with you but for me the problem isnt with the concept its with the decision. with us audience members being quick to judge.  Why is it up to any of us to determine whether Mike or Jade is being abusive?In that story I see two people who have probably been bottling up their emotions for a while finally let them out and so far neither is acknowledging the others point of view.  Whether one or both of them has a history of negating emotions or using them to manipulate the other or where they go from here we arent privy to and dont have enough info to draw much of a conclusion.Its worth understanding the concept of gaslighting so that we recognize it when its being used against us personally and dont let it confuse us.  Not so that we can diagnose everyone elses relationship problems.  Humans in general seem to be prone to that and it seems to be rampant on this forum regardless of the rules about no driveby diagnosis.The assume a context of abuse rule means that if Jade posts here first then Mike is the abuser.  But if Mike posts here first then Jade is the abuser.  ,raisedbynarcissists,d39bsnu,2,t5_2we9n

But thats a risky method and only works if you have a very strong spine and can put on a nobullshit attitude. That is firm and expressionless. The more advisable option is to just act like you cant hear them. Dont look embarrassed dont start defending yourself. Just act like they didnt even say the comment. As long as theyre not trying to sabotage you its not really worth the fight since snide remarks and passive aggressiveness is hard to report. If they start withholding information relating to your tasks or lying about your contributions then you need to talk to your boss. Honestly just interact with them as little as possible. ,raisedbynarcissists,d3aalri,2,t5_2we9n

For my current SO I stepped out of my comfort zone and went with someone who seemed too nice. It was really difficult and anxiety inducing at first but now I live in a household where we just exist have nice times and rarely argue. Its so peaceful that sometimes Im still anxious as to why its been years and things are still peaceful.I wouldnt have known what was normal until I went to therapy. I find that that strong pull you get from certain people actually tends to be unsolved issues begging to be healed. Every time Ive had a pull towards someone or got a mad crush on them it turns out they were an N or ACoN. I started avoiding those people I got a strong pull to and it turned out so much better. The pull is also a lot less since going to therapy less to heal.Meetup groups people with similar hobbies is a good place to start to make friends. Dont overshare at first people with healthy families dont tend to get it! I maneuver away from certain topics and focus on likesdislikeshobbies and it goes much better.

So when they go to a counselor or a psychiatrist simply nothing is wrong. For my mom its a rough life. Only those closest to her truly know what its like to suffer through her hell. My mom has been institutionalized  times in her life.

7815752,0,t3_4md6u8,This can be normal for a child of a narcissist. My Nmom would routinely run off to her room and cry big sobbing tears over stupid things and eventually it got to the point where wed all roll our eyes once she started. We knew shed go up there be loud for  minutes and then we would have to apologize when she came out even if she was usually the one in the wrong because there was no other way to get her to freaking STOP and leave us alone. As a result I couldnt cry in front of anyone. I was an emotionless robot because I thought emotions were irrational weapons and useless things.It took me years after moving to figure out and it turns out... no Nmom wasnt normal and thats not how emotions are supposed to work. My inability to cry was a barrier to protect myself from everyone around meif I didnt trust them I wouldnt cry around them an theyd never get a chance to hurt me for showing my soft fragile innards. It took me years to get to the point where I trusted my spouse enough to know that he would hold and comfort me when I cried not use it against me like Nmom would have. And frankly hes still the only person I feel comfortable crying around so far because those barriers are pretty hard to take down. XD But hey! Progress!Crying is great once you can get some of those barriers down OP. Crying helps you not hold things internally it gets it out in the open and helps your brain recover. When I dont cry these days it takes me days to get over something but when I do cryIm over it by the time the tears stop. It helps other people know when you need their help so they can come over and connect with you. It can definitely be used as a weapon but most people wouldnt even think about doing that and its only Ns who use emotions as a battering ram. Crying is supposed to be a way to say hey Im hurting right now so someone else can come up hold your hand and say Im sorry youre hurting. Im here for you bro.Take your time and work on this problem at a slow but steady pace. Start small... sharing some wishes and desires with close friends even if you feel scared to. Gain your confidence and trust slowly opening up until one day you cry around themand realize they arent judging you for it.

Ill keep that in mind for if god forbid he doesnt get a job in the next few months.

I said something to his boss once who told me he was never late for dinner so it wasnt a work thing. He would disappear on weekends. My kid was just talking about this yesterday how absent he was and all her memories are of me doing something with her like crafts. Later I found out he had a huge secret life.I realized it was not good but I felt like no marriage was perfect and I had to make the best of it. You know? I certainly wasnt perfect and at least he didnt scream at me. I just didnt realize how WRONG it was until I got out. By then I was so damaged and traumatized I was incapable of a relationship. I have tried to date but it was a disaster. Every guy I pick repeats my childhood.In my marriage I was desperately lonely. He just was so fucking selfish. Everything had to be his way and most of the time he was disengaged. He resented having a child or any responsibility for that matter. On her th birthday he stopped talking to her although he lives near her. No cards emails or texts. He was just done. She is a great person too and didnt deserve that.

7869044,0,t1_d3y3bfu,If I can make a gentle recommendation Alice Millers book Drama of the Gifted Child is a really good book about the effects of parents who themselves were tools for meeting their own parents needs unintentionally replaying the same dynamic with their children  unconsciously looking for someone to unconditionally love them.Your comment about struggling with feeling hurt reminded me of some parts of this book which discusses how if you yourself never felt your parents unconditional love you will spend your life seeking it out... and your own children are the easiest outlet for this. Early attachment is affected by how well caregivers acknowledge and honor their childrens emotional expression. So even if you intellectually know better when you emotionally interpret that your daughter doesnt want to cuddle as being about you rather than being about her she can tell. Infants become attuned to their caregivers emotional state because their survival depends on being able to correctly judge whether you will meet their needs. So when a caregiver feels hurt in the scenario you describe children even infants pick up on their underlying emotions and will suppress certain behaviorsemotional expression if those behaviorsexpressions evoke a negative reaction anger hurt etc in their caregiver. They will adapt their behavior to make sure you hang around and take care of them. These are the roots of the emotional suppression all ACoNs have because we learned we had to take care of our parents rather than our needs as children being put first.I hope I havent offended you. I just finished reading this book and it really struck a chord for me and I thought that I should share some of it since you obviously care so much about breaking the cycle. Especially since these things can seep through despite our best intentions. My best wishes to you!,raisedbynarcissists,d40jxmt,1,t5_2we9n

Shed also create crises with her angry needy alcoholic behavior over and over again. I remember her freaking out all the damn time giving equal freakout weight to stuff as major as the house being on fire or as minor as me spilling my milk at the dinner table so I never really quite learned how to tell what really warranted a major reaction and what didnt. What helps me these days is knowing that I have the tendency to catastrophize and worry overmuch. Just knowing it Im able to see myself doing it and go Oh  okay Im doing this thing that I do. Then Im able to pause and take a breath or two and kind of set those feelings to one side mentally theyre still there but it makes it easier to really think about whats going on and how to respond. Ive also used it to my advantage since I tend to think the worst will happen that also means Im very well prepared for a lot of potential disasters. Im able to consciously harness that fear and anxiety when Im planning something and ask myself what could happen  and then ask okay if that happened how would I deal with it? And then plan accordingly. Ive even woven it into my work ethic to be prepared for all sorts of possibilities.

But in the past when I had missed voice mails I didnt really know which voice it would be. Well one time during high school my mother left me a voicemail. Angry as can be about me having said to the school counselor that Im considering a lot of things as my career neuroscience maybe psychology maybe medicine. Whatever right? Well apparently I didnt know my mother was going to get this letter in the mail about our meeting or I wouldve lied. Anyway so back in highschool we used to have hour breaks for lunch and if you were a good lunch block you could have your phones out listen to music and stuff very good incentives for us to be cleaner and not fight. We had recently gotten a very good progressive younger principal. Sorry I keep digressing..... Any way. So I get this voicemail from a missed call from my mother. I think oh no there must have been an emergency! No she leaves me a voicemail about how I will not become a psychologist. Psychology is the devil. I am in league with Satan and she will ruin me if I even try. It will be over her dead body. All sorts of nasty unsupportive things. I just started crying right there at the lunch table. I then got up and rushed to the bathroom and just sobbed hysterically in the bathroom because I was so tired of not being good enough for her.Another time I got a voice mail I was on the bus. And on the bus we usually couldnt have our phones out. So I didnt pay attention to my phone. So I just had my headphones in and since Im the last stop on a  neighborhood route it usually takes an hour for me between school ending for me to get home. At that time I had a crappy phone that if it got bumped the wrong way would turn off. So it was also off. By the time I got home took the dog out fed him etc it was . My mother left me a voicemail. I actually have it transcribed from a tumblr post I wrote about it back then Yeah its  so youre still in the school? class is going good .isnt it. youre not home youre not in the phone youre not even off the bus walkign home because thats why you cant answer your phone. well good news for you because youre an adult then her voice gets deeper and all poisnous youll pay for what you do.So yeah.

7968032,0,t3_4oa439,Your Nmom labeled you a monster. That was her projecting something she disliked about herself on you. As with most Nthings the label had zero to do with you at all.gt But it makes me so angry. Why did it have to be me and my father and only us?Proximity accessibility and she could treat you the way she did because it was all hidden away from others. Characterizing you as the monster in the relationship also deflected unwanted attention on her actions that somehow created the monster.Your nmom created a persona. This persona is all others know. Like an actor that creates a memorable role to the point fans cannot separate the actor from their work your nmoms acquaintances are unable to separate your nmom from her work. Theyre mourning the loss of the actors most famous character. Youre dealing with the death of the egomaniac actor who originated that role.gt How do you deal with it?Ive long looked at the persona my nmom created as another person Ive never met. Its interesting to hear what others say about that person but I know theyve never met my nmom. So I just go along with peoples fantasies of the person they know being the same person as my nmom. I dont bother correcting them. It would do no good. The only time I adjust reality is when someone mentions my nmom commenting negatively about me or in relation to me. I then take the position that my nmoms persona struggles with lucidity and cognitive issues. Im always so sad that what the person tells me is just further confirmation that my nmom just isnt as strongly onbeam as she wants others to think. But I wouldnt dream of shattering her illusion she is fully coherent all the time. I do an amazing frowny concerned face too. Then I declare how thankful I am that my nmom can hold up so well around that person. I tell them it comforts me to know shes only slipping a little at this time. By doing this I sidestep being on the defensive due to what the person is conveying as it relates to me.The added bonus of taking this approach is that the person cannot go back to my nmom and say hey forfly thinks youre mental without the messenger receiving backlash from nmom. If nmom confronts me I just say person was telling me you had said all these things that made you sound like you were off your rocker. Nmom will never admit to my face negative things shes said about me to others. I maneuver her into an nnowin by using her ntendencies against her. When my nmom finally passes on Im going to be dealing with the same thing you are. Im going to have to pretend it was someone else who died because what others will be saying about her will not bear any relation to the nmom I knew. Frankly I mourned the loss of a loving mother years ago so I likely will not be mourning any at all either.,raisedbynarcissists,d4bokqb,1,t5_2we9n

BFF hubs kept the peace about  years and about  holes in the drywall There are lots of online resources for positive coparenting with a toxic ex. Document everything every email every text every failure to meet the requirements. I dont know where you live but in my state at  a child can petition the court about their own custody arrangements.

It is okay to vocalise that you are burning bridges. It is okay to express concern about the repercussions of this. Its not okay to tell you whether you should do that or not based on her own values.My therapist once asked Do you not have aunties or uncles? and I have periodically returned to that statement and told him how bloody stupid a question it was because quelle surprise they are all batshit too. ,raisedbynarcissists,d4j4dcl,2,t5_2we9n
8035428,0,t3_4p7e7y,I knew of learned helplessness from psych courses Ive taken but I never really made the connection to my situation until my therapist did it for me. Even after my therapist started to raise it took awhile for me really make the solid connection and I still often dont see ways out or traps. Ill go through great lengths to avoid things that feel like traps that really arent like oh no a party with a few strangers attending but get then get stuck in places that arent good for me and not realize it. Like when my family Dr was really not meeting my needs and it took me  years and lots of nudging from my therapist figure that out and Im not stuck and can go find a better Dr.For me the biggest resource right now for overcoming the learned helplessness is my therapist. She knows my history and is good at asking questions to gently point towards possible exitsoptions that the learned helplessness makes really hard for me to see on my own.

My dads side of the family will sit around and laugh about the abuse they endured and dished out too. It is bizarre to listen to and it makes me uncomfortable because I dont know what to say. It appears they are looking back on those memories fondly.Its been a red flag to me. A couple of years ago a man I was talking to told me about the time his dad lost it and punched his sister in the face and how they all laugh about it now. He went on and talked about how his dad was violent in general. I get that laughing may be a way to cope and hide the pain. I feel like by laughing it off maybe they arent grasping how serious it is and that they might repeat the cycle later. Just my thoughts.

8064904,0,t3_4pn5h6,Im so relieved to see this thread here. Yes I totally feel like an imposter sometimes...most times actually. I never bring it up. Mine is actually like a double edged sword. On one hand my CPTSD helps me stay calm as fuck in crisis. Its like a mundane super power. I just turn off my emotions and figure shit out act and then let myself process later when Im safe and situated. On the other I cant emote easily with others. I care a lot about people but Im very detached with an SO. Its super difficult for me to have dependent feelings for someone. Usually it starts as infatuation and then wears off quicker than I leave them and the break up is brutal heartless and sudden. I havent been in a meaningful relationship in  years and Im only  when I should have plenty of options being young and active and what not. And the other way my PTSD manifests is while driving when Im usually alone and in darkness which I avoid or Im alone to deal with. So I dont have to bring it up often. I definitely feel ashamed to call it PTSD because I know people have it so much worse but at the same time I recognize that everyones pain is legitimate as they experience it.,raisedbynarcissists,d4mkl0d,3,t5_2we9n

My dr told me not only this distinction but that Ive probably had it much longer than I had thought. I didnt know what was happening to me. When I would have to explain myself I felt guilty for taking away from the soldiers who so bravely chose to possibly get messed up amongst other things and didnt believe that was even a thing for civilians to have it too. I now know different.

8091608,0,t3_4pl9hc,Yeah. Its funny because all the way up until I was like  I desperately wanted kids and was convinced I would be a great mother and everything my mom wasnt to me because I am a great babysitter the kids always love me Ive volunteered in elementary schools and never had problems Im just generally really good with children.   But then my GC brother started developing his own personality.   Now I will still  maintain he is spoiled and disrespectful. Hes currently a  year old GC what do you expect when hes almost never told no. But I started realizing  that the way I react to it is just like my nmom would I yell at him when he was rude and scare him into complying the way I always was and tell him he was being spoiled and rude. Its funny I realized I was doing it because Nmom is on my case about it when I do telling me to stop being so mean and that I was being rude and treating him poorly. I dont remember exactly what the words she used the first time I realized it was but it basically amounted to that and I was angry she dared call me out on it because she did EXACTLY the same thing when I was a kid... which then made me realize I was doing exactly the same thing she did. Ive been trying to work on being nicer to him and I dont get upset with my Nmom when she gets on my case about yelling at him anymore  because even though shes hypocritical as fuck that doesnt make her not right in this case but now hes nine and hes gotten even worse than before and now shes falling back into the SG patterns she did with me when I was that age and I cant trust her to call me out on it anymore because in a scenario I might have done it shes probably already doing it.   This whole debacle has made me terrified to ever have kids. I dont understand it because Im still great with other peoples kids never caught myself doing this and never had anything remotely like this problem even with the spoiled ones. Part of me is afraid its overexposure to the same kid constantly for years and that even though Im great with every kid but my brother if I had my own kid Id end up treating him poorly too...

He made me cook for him when I was a kid even though no one ever taught me how to cook because if my mom wasnt there I was the female in the house and therefore it was my job to serve him. He once told me cheerleading was evil because I couldnt prove it was good and a part of Gods plan and Im pretty sure he probably thinks cheerleaders are evil too. He also HATES all actresses and likes to endlessly talk about how terrible each of them is and how they dont deserve the praise they get.Oh!

8110826,0,t3_4qb60l,Speaking as an atheist who is active in the secular community please take the Skeptics Annotated Bible with a a large dose of doubt.  The SAB focuses on the King James Bible and is filled with problems that are not actually problems for those who study theology or textual criticism.There are definitely problems that you can find in the Bible but if you bring up a gotcha from the SAB and have it shot down you will lose some credibility.  I use the SAB as a reference to point me toward critical areas in the Bible then I check them against the New English Translation online  I google the verse in question and see how it is explained away theologically and examine the logic in that.  I check against various online Bible Commentaries.  Matthew Henry is my favorite.  I find that Bart Ehrman is a good resource too.  And Wikipedia is often very good at explaining a biblical area and giving references to it.  Dont rely solely on Wikipedia!But more succinctly you are correct.  If the Bible were first published today it would be considered adult literature.  And if it were completely illustrated then State Law would require it be sold wrapped in a brown wrapper sealed in plastic and placed on a high shelf out of the reach of children.,raisedbynarcissists,d4rqaem,3,t5_2we9n

Especially that your nstepdad might be projecting and the fact that theyre both unhealthily obsessed with the sexuality of an eightyearold child. Id also like to add that ustoptakinggoodnames was subjected to inappropriate remarks for such an age. Even if they were to suspect you were gay at such a young age it doesnt matter because youre eight years old!!! To me it sounds like their pressure on you from when you were so little has put pressure on you and driven you to overthink and overcomplicate the issue. Like uUrbanCowgirl just said If youre gay thats your business. But honestly? For a lot of people if not MOST people sexuality is a fluid thing and it can vary even depending on the time of day. But thats okay if thats who you are!!! Maybe its because of your parents and their inappropriate behaviour or maybe its who you already are The most important thing is to just be comfortable with yourself. I suggest you VERY lightly go and explore your own sexuality. Using the internet in the privacy of your own home. Just be honest about what does doesnt and might arose you and just go from there.

8149389,0,t3_4qvcse,Youre not being in anyway unreasonable. Do whats right for you. I personally changed my names first middle and surname at the start of this year. My new first name is just one that Ive always really liked and I feel as though it suits me. My middle name is from a character in a television show who I really identify with. And my new surname is based on a folktale about being grateful for each new day were given. My decision behind changing my entire set of names was for a number of reasons.  I was bullied a lot at school everyone who knew my name knew me as a freak. I felt like changing my name would help me feel free of this label.  When people called me by my old name it almost felt like they should have been calling to someone else. I didnt feel like it was me.  I felt like my name belonged to my family and their identity rather than mine.  My family treated me like I was their property so my old name made me feel like I was still their property even when Id begun NC.  I want a career helping people who suffer from mental health problems. My family were a huge part of why Ive suffered and still suffer from mental health issues. Also my ngrandmother had awful opinions about the mentally ill as did my nfather but not as bad. I would feel like such a fraud trying to help these people only for them to call me by a name so heavily connected to people who helped cause my mental health problems and who had discriminatory opinions about the mentally ill. When changing your name it might help you to think about the reasons you want to change your name. It might help you decide whether you want to retain some of your past or identity through a name similar to your current one or whether youd rather express a new or hidden identity or erase the past with a new name.

NPDs arent potential abusers every interaction they have and everything they do is to feed them their narcissistic supply theyre junkies for manipulation. They dont even recognise other people as actual people in the NPDs mind theyre the only one that exists with everything they do and everything that happens around them being of cosmic significance so yes I would certainly describe this as defective.when you read your post and change the word people to people who like to masterbate with their childrens bodies it kind of makes it really absurd and makes me think if we have the tools to identify Narcissists we should be doing.

Im an idiot. He told me  as if to reassure me  that a number of his family members this weekend had pulled him aside to tell him not to let his mom control him to be sure that hes doing what he wants. I was encouraged by that Me OH GOOD theyre not all snowed by her and took that as an opportunity to tell him what Ive learned here how the pieces all fall together. Of course it made no difference first theres so many reasons its all complicated its not just her and its my dad too Im reading him as enabler now actually literally BF tells me his dad tells him to do what his mom wants to make her happy since shes dying. Then when I asked for reasons Theyre innumerable. I ask for just five of those reasons? Its not just my mom its my dad who wants this too and then he sidetracked and didnt list any more.I cant save him I have to remember that. Hes sticking his head in the sand so he doesnt have anxiety attacks because when he does he wants OUT. But as long as he carefully doesnt think about it then hes content enough to take it day by day and nothing is fixed in stone never mind that his mom is taking what steps she can to ensure that IT IS. Except he tells me that I deserve better and he just wants me to be happy and that we shouldnt have gotten so close so its not like hes trying to string me along except as best friends which he cant understand would be any different from what we have now except he happens to be in another state. And married to someone else.As soon as I pointed out that he himself told me that his family members were taking him aside to warn him not to let her control him then he told me that they all said he was doing a good thing i.e. helping his cousin out of Iran by the arranged marriage but to be sure that it was on his terms not his moms. I asked what his terms were  such as for how long if hes talked to this cousin to know what SHE wants and is being told what he will tell her i.e. how to separate once she has her citizenship  and the only thing he could tell me was that he demanded that he be able to keep me as a friend and visit with me. Note that is that HE comes to ME Im not wanted THERE. Nothing about exit strategy. Nothing about what this cousin may want or if she may refuse divorce and he will have NO leverage to enforce it since he will have the biggest price to pay if he says it was just to get her citizenship. When I tell him that he is responsible for TEN YEARS for her financially then he says that his parents will pay for it all that they have lots of money. And later how he wants to win the lottery to help them out... and I say what happened to all that money you said they were willing to spend to get what they want... but didnt say that? Oh theyre stingy Id like to buy them things they dont buy themselves. And when I ask about plans for this cousin? Shell be going to college so shell be busy we probably will barely even talk. ... Um she doesnt speak English. And shes his age apparently which is late s... what is her educational background? Undergrad completed? When?  What has she been doing since? Which college will take her and for what if she hasnt been in school for years or took this long to finish?  And who will pay? You say her family is poor and she wont be a resident or even a citizen to qualify for instate tuition or federal help. Oh my parents will pay. Hes also said he wants to require her to get a job so he wont feel obligated and tied to her to support her for years because shes helpless and poor and forced to come for his mother to feel happy. And later that she took care of her mother through cancer so she can take care of his mother now. So... wait. Shes going to go to college that she cant afford and likely wont qualify for any time soon. And shell have to have a job that will support her. AND shell be a fulltime nurse to your mother and housekeeper to you and your EDad since you and your EDad will be too busy with work and youre too private a person to want to hire strangers to help when your NMom cant keep up with it any more. AND learn English. All at the same time? And this is to better HER life rather than to benefit your Nmother with cheap nursing and company she cant drive away since this cousin will be indebted to and dependent on her? .... Mutter mutter head in sand....So yeah. Stupid me I tried to save him. Hes smart he detached once before surely he can see this. But as Ive told him myself intelligent people often just use their intelligence to prove what they WANT to believe... and he certainly is in this case.  And he so desperately wants to believe that hes doing the right thing and that its better for US this way too that he threatened to cut me off  YOURE BACKSLIDING ALREADY!  if I continued to be so negative.  I actually was angry enough to point out that he is now doing what he always complained about his mother doing Do what I want or Ill cut you out of my life!

8182547,0,t3_4rdwr0,She wont turn into your mother but damn is she going to have to work hard to repair herself amp become a healthy human being.  Her work is going to be getting rid of any FLEAS she may have picked up she may act Narclike but as she doesnt have the disorder she can and likely will fix herself.  You dont mention any here but watch her carefully with her peers and you might see some behaviors that need adjusting.  relearn everything she thinks is normal about relationships her whole world has been this crazy woman.  She thinks that relationship is the standard.   learning how to love amp have a relationship with herself given nmoms shittalking and your sisters selfharming shes already been given the gift of low selfesteem.  learn how to have healthy relationships she cant even bump into you with a shopping cart or use your makeup without having a meltdown. She has no clue how to behave properly in a healthy relationship.   Edit also she needs to learn how to manage her emotions in a healthy way.  thats hard enough as a teenager!! how to operate in the real world your mom didnt teach her how to blow her nose?  shes not going to teach her how to dress appropriate how to enter puberty with grace how to be polite how to open a bank account how to apply to colleges how to apply to jobs. . .Anyway.

8184458,0,t1_d50jry6,I probably shouldnt have mentioned it but I was in a daze.  Said that I was considering leaving and my daughter got extremely upset.  Could see her self blaming and begging me not to leave.  Its a tragic situation and Im so gutted Im in this situation.  She did the classic raising me on a pedestal and I was swept up.  I always think I can change people.   Im in sales and can negotiate like a pro but jesus no.  Whenever she even senses criticism she goes on the passive agressive attack.  She senses it when its not even there sometimes.  Even me at my sharpest and most careful treading...always she gets upset and tries to make me feel guilty for upsetting her.  Because she does so much and tried so hard.  She was never like this before and then its got like this over time.  Im fucked either way really. ,raisedbynarcissists,d50lw4h,2,t5_2we9n

8190208,0,t3_4ri4wy,Congratulations on the baby!Knowledge is half the battle on this one.  You know about what was wrong about your childhood and you know that you dont want to repeat that with your own child.  You also know what you as the child would have been better off with.What might get you is the ingrained reflexive things that you at some deep level learned from your mother.  You might let something pop out of your mouth before you know it  its a common thing even with healthy families that a new parent says something to their child even a harmless thing and then thinks Where did that come from? and the answer is its something theyve picked up unknowingly from how their family words things.But it sounds like youve explored a lot of that in therapy etc. so the chance of it is less.   There is also the fact that you have empathy with your child while your mother had none for you.  Thats another part of the battle  empathy.  You wont always get it right with your daughter because you cant literally read minds duh but your real love for her and your true empathy and longing to actually understand her will always come through and problemsmisunderstandings can be fixed.One last thing I have discovered  I dont have any kids of my own medical reasons but I have lots and lots of nieces and nephews and cousins etc.   I was so afraid that Id do like my Dad always did and just start yelling about things that really arent important in the big scheme of things or that are important to kids but not adults.   So many times I wanted to ask him was that worth it? but of course I couldnt.So way before it became relevant I decided that whenever I felt like criticizing any of the kids I would stop and think Is this about them or is is about me?.   In other words is what they are doing actually dangerous in some way to them or in some other way actually wrong or is it something harmless thats just bugging me because Im the adult and of course am going to find little kid things annoying sometimes?Because what it comes down to for me is I am the adult.  If theyre doing something like repeating a phrase back and forth between each other but having fun but its getting on my nerves I can walk away and do something else.  Is it worth having a fit at them and spoiling their fun? Only if this is about me and not them which it isnt.And on the other hand if they really are doing something they shouldnt that moment of stepping back and asking myself that question has let me deal with what they are doing in a lot more gentle of a way.  The three year old isnt putting pennies in the clothes hamper on purpose to piss me off or because she doesnt care about what a hassle thats going to be to me later shes doing it because shes a three year old and really random stuff entertains three year olds.  Realizing this helps me distract her to do something else instead of getting madwhich based on what my Dad always did I might do before I realized it though my goodness I hope not.One good side effect of this thought process is that I find I really enjoy the kids in a way that my Dad didnt seem to.  Its actually amusing to me to sit just out of sight and listen to the silly stuff they do and say.   I appreciate that they are actually having fun and being kids and that throwing a wet blanket on harmless kid stuff is just selfish and cruel.So anyway sorry about that being long but basically in my opinion if you know what you dont want to repeat if you have genuine empathy for your child if you ask yourself who this is about and you can appreciate your children and have fun with them and let them have fun  youre going to be a great parent.  And it sounds like you have all that going for you!,raisedbynarcissists,d51bssz,3,t5_2we9n

I have no idea what parts of me are innate  and which parts were responses to the abuse. I think ending the cycle has much much more to do with the people you surround yourself with and what your personal breaking point is. Some people have no breaking point so they just get ground down and literally dont know any other way to be. And they continue the cycle. The people dealing with this stuff currently also have a MUCH bigger community to support and believe them.

As opposed to tampons where you pick size depending on how much you bleed.   Clean it well use soap and lather it thoroughly for a minute but it doesnt need to be super  disinfected because while putting it inside there will be a bit of germs from the entrance of your vagina on it anyway its normal to have germs there. So be clean but dont excessively worry about it either. And  You may have difficulties using it if youre still a virgin.

I was the black sheep and she pushed me away but I was the only one to stand up for her and do everything for her. I literally carried her to the bathroom when she was so sick and she was weak. I think it changed her when she saw who was really there for her. When she found out she had terminal cancer she changed completely. Not for show but it was genuine. Being faced with your own mortality changes you. My dad has a terminal illness but he just got worse. I had my good time with her. It was short but I rather remember that not the bad stuff. She was abusive but it wasnt anything like what I went through with my father. I was able to forgive her.

The chance of jail hitherto for the sake of argument equal to the chance of freedom or retaliation equally arbitrary against the definitive timeframe of abuse that will continue unless action is taken? Id risk all I had if it meant even the slight possibility of freedom. I think it is inherently wrong to ask anyone to put up with it a little longer just to avoid physical altercation. I think there is more to it though. In our quiet little civilised lives we have developed a morality that doesnt encourage altercation and I think we are failing to see when it might be justified. We have allowed this morality to dictate our responses even to horrific scenarios such as abusive parents or partners and insist on believing in the possibility of good where it has been proven otherwise. Just to put your mind at ease I dont intend to go about encouraging people to harm their abusers  it is not by upsetting a society that one engenders trust or change.

Its okay to feel angry outraged hurt and wronged. But there are ways for you to heal and work through that and be happy in spite of her actions. Id suggest going to a therapist or a counselor to help sort through those bad feelings so it doesnt impact you or your little family.I cant really say it gets better because I have relapses and emotional pitfalls in my NC struggles too.

8387184,0,t3_4ugtu3,I think comedy writers may often have used humor as a coping mechanism in their real life and that getting creative and making a character who is in fact behaving in an abusive way seem funny is a way of dealing with that type of person presenting a view of them that is different than their view of them self or the view of their primary target. I dont like the fact that on TVin a movie this abusive character will be shown to have redeeming qualities that are somehow supposed to excuse their abuse.Roseanne with Roseanne Bar is an older show that I thought was funny when I was a kid. If I watch an old episode now I just cringe because she speaks to her husband and kids in a horrible way. I have never been able to deal with everybody loves Raymond because of all the yelling and shrill voiced hostility.George Coastanza and his parents on Seinfeld was brilliantly writtenacted and funny to me but I cannot imagine tolerating any of them in real life.I think most of these characters are written by people who probably have had some experience with absurd obnoxious and controlling family members. I think making it funny is probably a way of showing that these personality types are common and that it is pretty absurd to control or be controlled by another adult. I dont think these characters are usually written with the intent that people should follow the example of the character. In fact I think its typically the opposite the writer is pointing out how ridiculous the persons behavior is and the audience is laughing at them.It is difficult to watch a lot of these characters if you actually have the real life equivalent in your family.All in the Family with the racist ultraconservative character of Archie Bunker and his longsuffering wife Edith is probably one of the best examples of this kind of writing. The show was on at a time the s when generational differences and social change were a very real part of many households in America. Both Carroll OConner and Jean Stapleton were phenomenal actors who were nothing like their characters in reality and they played their roles for all they were worth. It was a real case of art imitating life.Anyway I think that some showsfilms are actually highlighting what is wrong with the characters thinking and that it can be good to see them as funny because it does help to deconstruct what is in your own life much more serious. I do not like that there seems to be the message that family is always redeemable and that these characters have hearts of gold buried beneath all the dysfunction.You are so right to question this.

There is not accounting of his deeds just a vague I wasnt a great brother. He does through in an apology at the end so thats something. Was it just neglect and ignoring or was he more active than that?The bit Im stuck on is that he doesnt want your kid thinking ill of him. If hes really come to terms with what he did hed accept that such is the consequence of being a jerk to you something he readily admitted.  I cant say what you should do I dont know how much more there was in your past that he didnt mention. But if I got this from my Nsis I probably would reply although Id wait a few days to show Im not jumping to any bait. Id probably send something like thisgt Hi there. Im sorry to hear you went through x event. I sounds like its made you see things more clearly. Thank you for the apology and acknowledging the neglect. It is appreciated. However because there is such a long history between us Im not ready to just let you back in. You did x y and z to me and that still hurts me. This letter is all about how you feel and I need you to think about what your actions did to me and my spouse and understand were we are coming from. What my child thinks of you is not for you to say. If you want them to think better of you DO AND BE BETTER. If you really regret what you did you will understand my actions and why my child might think those things.

8394144,0,t1_d5qqzah,Its hard to explain. I got my membership through confirmation class. The church lets th graders go through it over the summer every Sunday night you go and learn something about the church like history symbols leadership roles your role etc. it wasnt really a bible class as much as a this is what we do here kind of thing. Even though I dont like the whole church thing anymore it was really informative and interesting and probably part of the reason I know so much about Methodists. Baptists Presbyterians I was baptized at birth at this church and Lutherans among others have membership. If you become a Methodist you can just transfer membership from there. I think all that makes you a member is your vows to the church and baptism. Ive been baptized twice once at birth and once at confirmation so I can only be baptized once more as far as I know. Every person Ive ever seen whos wanted to become a member just comes in front of the church and the pastor and them exchange words the congregation says some words and then theyre a member. Members are also required to tithe regularly and such as long as youre able to. I dont think you sign papers or anything but the churches are required to bring in so many members and stuff to keep the church going. Theres conferences for different regions and pastors are cycled through every  years. Since Ive only been a Presbyterian and a Methodist which are very similar I didnt know Catholics didnt have membership! But really its probably just called something different for you.

8477263,0,t3_4voxur,My Nmom is a hoarder too. Aside from cramming junk into every available corner she has one room in the house dedicated to junk. The piles of stuff go halfway up the wall and there is no floor visible you have to climb on top of stuff to move across the room. Whats even more crazy is that my moms closet is in here. Not entirely sure how that works.In high school my brother and I took an entire day to gut out that room. We found bedroom furniture that we kept in there hoping to make it into a guest bedroom. Everything else was either in my truck ready to be donated or thrown away or waiting in a littleused room downstairs for a second trip to the thrift storedump. When our mom came home she freaked. She started yelling about important papers and picking through things like we can use this! I will use this someday! Stuff has been in that room for years mostly old things like a s computer or stacks of papers like childhood projects from my brother and I. Mom ended up putting everything EVERYTHING back into the vacuumed and cleaned bedroom. She threw nothing away.

8491859,0,t1_d62pll7,gt Still he hasnt dropped the case.The lawyers have a duty towards their clients. The lawyers are .. well hired guns who work for the one who pays. They dont need to truly and fully believe in everything their client says or wants but someone needs to do the job nevertheless. As long as they have taken a client on and the client doesnt confess or clearly imply theyre lying to their lawyer the lawyer should give him or her the benefit of doubt and do their job. The system relies on both parties having access to legal representation  even the one thats in the wrong. At least in my neck of the woods an advocatebar member canshould only drop a client if there is lack of trust between the client and the lawyer  usually it means situations where the client doesnt trust the lawyer and cooperate in a reasonable way. Anyway I dont know how good a lawyer your mother has but it might be better if her lawyer is a decent person than if she had someone ruthless andor difficult. Your lawyer will need to be on his or her toes of course but at least the arguments coming from a decent lawyer are less likely to be crazy and deliberately timeconsuming and more likely something your lawyer knows to expect already. After all there are two ways to win a case one can use the law how its supposed to be used and one can mess up stuff looking for technical loopholes and whatnots tiring the opposition and the court off until someone makes a mistake. I like the first kind better.And in the end a decent lawyer to a difficult client can speed up the proceedings a lot. They are supposed to .. well babysit their difficult clients. A difficult person representing herself if nobody takes the case that is will very likely derail things take up irrelevant shit and be generally difficult. A good lawyer keeps his or her client quiet and from disturbing the proceedings. Lawyers go where the money is. Its not personal he doesnt harbor any ill feelings against you or your husband and he might even hope you win. Still a decent lawyer will sticks to his loyalty and separates the job and the private opinions he has about the case. Heck I go to the court every now and then fully expecting to lose because I privately believe I really shouldnt win  but it doesnt stop me from doing what Im paid to do.

Yes it would have been hard and stressful but the woman is a nightmare. Thing was my father loved her more than anything on this planet. He knew she was batshit insane but his love for her overruled all other sense for him. At xmas my brother and I found out she had an affair when we were very young she probably had more over the years but we got solid proof of this particular one. Who also happens to have my brothers name...Now he is definitely my fathers son he looks like my dad but still. To learn that you have the same name as a man with whom your mother was having an affair with when you were v young and possibly even before you were born? fucked up. Plus we both know that man he remained a family friend...My Dad had ample reasons and opportunities as I said he knew what she was and there were so many red flags but he just could not do it. He was from a divorced family and it really took a toll on his and his siblings. Thing was his parents situation was different but I think it really played a part in him staying with her. Plus he worshiped her right up to dementia destroying him. Yet she treated him with contempt and down right cruelty.Although on the flip side had he left her when we were younger would we have learned what she was?

So they translated what I told them from Dogs boyfriend assaulted her into Dogs had sex and so needs to be punished. So they called his mom and told her she packed him off across the country for the rest of the summer and grounded me for the rest of the summer and most of the following school year.

8564615,0,t3_4x2jug,I feel envious when I see decent goodenoughof families. Yesterday I saw a parent who said Im sorry to her child for bumping into her unintentionally which made me feel envious anger inside. I think that the reason for that is that I have never heard Im sorry or thank you from my own parents which is basically what I have been deprived of which is unconditional acceptance and love. In some ways Im happy to see that other people do that but I would had wished to experience it myself too which kind of dimishes my joy for the others experiencing it.I keep contact with one family member my GC brother with whom I am very close with. We basically hug each other whenever we meet and share things that we are vulnearable about. I think it is amazing to have relationships like that but mostly I have kind of replaced family with close and intimate friends.One thing that I struggle with is when I am dating a girl who asks about my parents and would like to meet them. With dating I usually dodge the family relationssubject as long as possible but when it comes to a point it would make sense to meet them I simply state that my relationship with my parents didnt work and I had to go different roads with them. If they ask further I simply show them wikipage of gaslighting and say Look this is my whole childhood. I dont keep contact with them and this is nonnegationable with me. When meeting the parents of SO I am relatively nervous and expect kind of asshattery from their parents that I did from mine but usually it tends to be that they are actually really decent and even great people which also makes me somewhat envious of them again for having this kind of parents. But all people have their own burden to carry which may be hidden to outside perceiver. I think that is all comes down to accepting your own past and how this was the only way to things go because you were conditioned to become who you are now. Others had it better others had it worse and I seriously doubt that we st world people who live in the decently rich west have it worst even if our parents did suck in our personal experience. With comparing to others there will always be someone who is better off than you and also those worse off than you. There is a parable about Poor man is not who has the least but who desires more after  having everything which I believe to be very true in my own experience. ,raisedbynarcissists,d6c5lvc,3,t5_2we9n

That being said it is a boundary violation even if unintentional. My suggestion is reply with a Hey just want to sort out some details with you bringing the kids. What will they need? Should we reschedule or Hey my house isnt real kid friendly and they may be really bored. How about another location like those indoor play places with an attached coffee shop?

Otherwise you might as well eat meat. They used the false dilemma in the same exact way that my Nmom and her relatives always had e.g. to reduce a multifaceted reality to something black and white.  People who say these things aim to make you feel stupid for being able to do something that they are incapable of doing being true to yourself.

8728171,0,t3_4zkmmt,Yes! I grew up on bar food stuff served at college house parties and delivered pizza.  Mom was a bar star party girl who had no time to cook. From kindergarten we were fending for ourselves. One summer we lived at a college party house with her bf he became our stepdad and his roomates we got breakfast by scavenging bags of chips on the floor. I can count on one hand how many times she cooked us a meal and not once did she ever prepare our school lunches not even first day. The best meals we got were from the restaurants she waitressed at she pointed us out to customers for pity tips. Kraft dinner and lunch meat were considered a luxury. Canned beans canned veggies sandwiches hot dogs she ate like a kid. Every once in awhile a bag of apples. Nothing in the freezer except ice and cigarettes. She told people her improvement on parenting was she wasnt going to make us eat anything we dont want to eat which was what SHE didnt want to eat.. I take it she was forced to eat veggies. For years straight I had nothing but white bread and a slice of imitation Kraft cheese for school lunch. I stole food from my friends at school if I had any. We had no manners when around good food gobbling monsters couldnt hide how unusual it was for us. When we settled down with Estepdad things got a bit better we had meat and potatoes for years.. but there was a solid line between what they were allowed to eat and what we as kids were allowed to eat some cupboards were strictly off limits. Mom couldnt follow through on the bullshit she fed him about wanting to be more of a mom if she had a chance she hated to be expected to peel a pot of potatoes for dinner so most cooking fell on Dad and I but I had no idea wtf I was doing. For the first  years of my life until she kicked me out I had white spots on my nails a sure sign of malnutrition.Now Im a vegetarian and I make practically everything from scratch. Fruits and veggies from my garden or the local farmers market. I bake my own bread like a boss. When I started transitioning it really hit me how little I know about food so Ive made it my mission to educate myself on proper nutrition and feeding my body what it wants and needs. Such a rewarding journey I love cooking and combining spices! The best feeling in the world is seeing my man moan and roll his eyes while chewing food I cooked for him.

8736963,0,t1_d6xp3lk,If your boss is aware of the problem and your job wouldnt be threatened by her offthewall accusations then I think the best course of action is going to be to realize this behavior isnt about you. Yes shes yelling at you but it is because of her issues. Becoming defensive is only going to make things worse but you also cant just let her run over you. Like many Ns she most likely isnt going to change. If she has psych issues that arent addressed or under control then all of the above also holds true. Maybe you can talk to your boss and coworkers. Get some feedback on how to best handle Eva and the situation. There are also articles online about how to handle difficult patients that can give you some good strategies to consider. This one is from the American Academy of Family Physicians and I think the first two sections under Patient Factors are relevant. You could also try asking her what has her so upsetangry. I dont know how constructive it will be but maybe she will talk herself out. That was a strategy one of my professors gave us in a crisis intervention class.  It will also be important for you to have some kind of outlet after dealing with her. Again talking with your boss or coworkers can be part of this. A good focus on selfcare can also relieve some of the stress of dealing with a difficult person. That doesnt give you a better way of managing her care but it can be like a reward for grinning and bearing it.I hope that helps. ,raisedbynarcissists,d6xroxd,1,t5_2we9n

Cleaned often meant thrown out but only if it wasnt my moms stuff. And she would scream at me for my mess basically nonstop...even though the mess that triggered her was all her stuff and I barely left anything around outside my own room. Her cleaning rampages were usually triggered by her own selfloathing.She also loved to scream at me for having a messy room but it was really an excuse to berate me for having a room to myself and closing the door. When I went to college she turned my small walkin closet into a stairway to the attic making my room a thoroughfare between two floors.

He lives at home has never worked a job never finished highschool never had a girlfriend. Hes been groomed to be my mothers caregiver forever. I remember feeling deep resentment when we were kids over how he was treated comparatively but looking back I see I was kind of lucky because all the focus was always on him. It gave me a little breathing room from Nmom when I needed it. I feel a bit of guilt over it too leaving him behind but I had to get out and take care of myself and I dont know how to help him.I once read something on another post about GCs that I havent forgotten. In summary it was pointed out that in a lot of cases us scapegoats are better prepared for the real world because of all the hardships we went through. GCs oftentimes lack selfsufficiency or independence as a result of all the handouts so while their childhoodslives may look enviable in fact they may be more emotionally and mentally crippled then their scapegoat siblings.,raisedbynarcissists,d719n9f,7,t5_2we9n

8818524,0,t1_d77sv7b,Thanks for your comment! I just woke up and I was so glad to see all these helpful views people have offered. Your comment really hit home quite hard.gt We need to heal! We need to be better than our parents and You are being emotionally abusive if you dont apologize! ... Being an ACON your worst fear is to end up like your parents so OF COURSE youll think its reasonable to apologize for everything.This I believe summarizes exactly the kind of motive that makes me follow through with the constant demand to apologize and better my behavior. Perhaps in a misguided sense he also genuinely feels like my quirks should all be smoothed in a way it pleases him because if I dont hell consider me abusive. Its argumentation I often trace in his words. Eager to do well I want to meet him halfway. But halfway is not satisfactory often enough... Indeed my intuition tells me its not normal. My intuition tells me there should be room to be me and for him to be him without constantly being scaled and evaluated... I long for air to just breathe. I feel trapped. The article you forwarded really hit home. It was hard to read through. It felt sickened because I recognized what was described about sick systems in our relationship. I felt very restless and on the verge of tears reading through it... gt a system in which personal loyalty and devotion are proof of your lovers worthiness as a person you can make people love youMy partner also has constant tests whether I am able to sacrifice enough for him to be worthy of love. Just last night when I was about to fall asleep he asked me Did you miss me when you were in Korea? I studied there last year for  months And I replied Of course I missed you. And he said Would you have stayed longer if you could? And I said Well truthfully we had so many fights going on before I left that it was good to have a little distance. And going on exchange is very exciting. It was the happiest time of my life. So if I could stay longer for  months I probably wouldve. Going on exchange is a onceinalifetime experience after all. And then he said flatly Okay I understand enough then. So I asked feeling wary Understand what? And he said People who dont miss their lovers when they go away on such things should be single. I am going to have to think about this. I tried to offer We knew it was only temporary. Many college students have a period of exchange. It helps my career so it will also help us in the future. Its only for one time. But his attitude was like nope youre that kind of person who should be single. As if no one else I could meet in my life would be able to support a longdistance relationship for  months. Thankfully I know better...  Its like everything I do for myself that helps me be a whole and happy person is threatening to him. The sick system article made sense in that perspective because he might feel threatened that if I accumulate happiness and gratification through other means than  the relationship the easier Ill recognize our flawed relationship and want out of a sick system. Whenever I do mention Im done in this way hell say but you are my life and while it seems sweet its also a heavy burden to be somebodys lifeline.The constant thinking this will get better if only we reach  goal if I only had a few days of rest I could think about what I want to do with our relationship... But theres never time to cool down from an argument and really think about it. Because well be in a fight. So keeping the crises rolling... The small successes like how he flipped  degrees after he came back from the barber and I though okay so we can put this behind us nice!. He does also chop up my time. If I talk about personal issues on Facebook hell patronize me that Facebook Messenger isnt a place to discuss things and hes right! But if I have a dinner party with friends hell have no issues sending me a longwinded message about how I am emotionally abusive... In the long past hed even fight me through work email! Hell also complain that hes not invited to the diner party even though its not custom to bring your partner with you and in fact none of the ladies did. But he has this need to be concluded in everything. My friend who called off her wedding hadnt invited him facetoface to their wedding but only through me and he was so grudging about it. When we talk about her wedding he kept bringing it up but she hasnt personally invited me! despite that shes only friends with me and not him. If they had their individual friendship it mightve made sense... He seems incredibly insecure in some ways to me. And if I am too calm in a discussion hell rile me up until he believes I am crazier than him. Last week I was playing PS to distract myself and he turned it off forceably and said No. If I am going to be crazy you will be equally crazy with me. And then hell patronize me for losing my cool at a certain point and revert back to being absolutely reasonable and in control of the conversation. See? Youre so emotionally unstable you need to change your behavior! If only you do  I will be happy with you. Hell talk about how I am sick and need psychological treatment. If I confront him with how he talks to me hell condemn me for guilt tripping him and not taking responsibility of my actions. I dont constantly remind him of the ugly things he says during a fight. But if I say one thing that is indeed wrong hell use it constantly to defend himself and gain ground in a makeup conversation. Honestly I do not think he is insidious and that its a calculation. I dont want to believe that about him. But I think this is his instinct because maybe he feels threatened by me on some level but also entangled with me as weve been on this journey together for a long time. Since we have met at  weve had very different paths in life and personal development. He will have said at times I feel like I am supposed to be successful in life. I feel like I should be rich in life or I feel like I want to start a successful business but he doesnt put in much effort to attain those goals. Hes had some major setbacks that make sense to have been a struggle to him but hes been without a jobstudy for  years now and hes manipulating social security so he can plan in the meantime to suddenly get a good job that he finds agreeable or otherwise stay on welfare indefinitely. I have actually graduated with honors last month while working parttime through college and volunteering. Also Im quite proud of this as life was very tough. Sometimes I went to an exam even if the night before hed have thrown a major tantrum and used to be physically abusive and Id still get an A but I knew it couldve been an A if I actually had the peace to study. Now I got into a prestigious master and my future is looking bright. But he often talks down on people with a successful academic lifecareer because he feels they should put the relationship on max priority and being ambitious gets in the way. I guess my success is a roadblock to controlling me and demanding more of my time. Maybe thats a trigger to micromanage me maybe he feels Im leaving him behind in life and will be bound to move on in time... If thats his fear because Im just speculating his way of keeping me is counterproductive in the end... But like the sicksystem article reads probably more effective to keep me attached than being plain respectful and nice.My stomach feels upside down reading everybodys insights and the article you posted. I really want to get out of this relationship. I feel it in my gut. Whenever I read back to a post I make like all the above I am incredulous at how I am still in this union. But the sick system article makes sense how such a situation can drag on and on and on... Summarizing I feel a little ashamed. Why am I so bad at setting barriers? Well your post was a comfort because I felt understood. This community on reddit is a comfort because I know people get it here. So thank you! And also everyone else who commented if you read this! Ill try to follow the other advises on how to prepare for a breakup and Ill likely look for support at my GP. Emotionally its very draining and its hard to be steady in my convictions and determination this way.... ,raisedbynarcissists,d77v777,2,t5_2we9n

Im also not something that passes from one person to another so no need to be given away. The theoretical idea of having your father guide you to your future husband is very touching if you have a supportive and respectful father. Ndad saw his daughters as burdens he could relieve himself of through marriage. Im so glad name of my sister one of his SGs got married. Now I no longer have to worry about her. So I had no desire to be given away by such a man. Traditions are good when they give stability and a sense of belonging. Like an annual family gathering where you do activity X that brings joy to all. Just remembering that makes you happy. Traditions are bad when they are abused when they make you unhappy and stressed when they force you into situations that are not good for you.Some traditions should be broken when they arent right for you. You create new traditions that are right for you. My husband and I made the tradition of watching the most horrible and unsuited movie for Christmas.

8848603,0,t1_d7bfksn,They are telling you you are hypersensitive simply because they dont want to actually deal with it. Its basically their way of putting their hands over their ears and singing la la la la. Because if you would simply get over it then they wouldnt actually have to do anything hard  like kick the guy out.  In effect they are putting all of their potential trauma having to deal with making Jay have some actual consequences onto you   in addition to your original trauma. Its a selfish immature and downright cruel method of handling someones abuse.  Frankly I sort of want to punch them all in the face every day for  years  and then tell them they are hypersensitive if they complain!I know you said that going NC isnt conceivable to you right now. But if I were you Id honestly start working on it. It may seem like just one thing that they are doing  but the reality is that is shows an incredible lack of concern for you and your wellbeing. And this goes for your boyfriend too. This is a pretty clear indication that  though they may be superhelpful when its easy for them  they will cut out when things get hard in short when youd need them most.  When you really really need them...then they just arent going to be there. Theyve proven that by how they are NOT there for you now.  So Id work on increasing your independence  financially and emotionally.

Most states have hotlines you can call for information on shelters if you still have access to a phone. If you dont try to find shelters in your state and contact them via email and see what the requirements are. I was in a program that assisted LGBT youth in finding shelters there might be similar programs in your state so its worth a shot trying.I know for some shelters of victims of domestic abuse they can pick you up from your house if you dont have access to transport.

8875424,0,t1_d7e77yq,I think your paranoia about women is a pretty common reaction when all the important women in your life were insane.  I used to have a similar problem with men.  I had too many bad experiences with men and many important men in my childhood were cruel and insane.  It took me therapy and years of observing normal and nonscary men before I could start trusting again.  Now I feel like I have pretty good sadistic and insane radar so I feel safer in the world and I have very little fear that I will ever let someone like that near me again. Therapy can definitely help.

A few things helped me with this... Therapy. Quite a lot of therapy. Being kind to myself and treating myself with respect  because I was giving myself that cruel treatment too and it really did help when I started trying to be kinder to myself.And I did an exercise where you make two lists a list of things you know to be true about yourself and then a list of things you were told or made to feel about yourself. After I wrote that out I started thinking things like well you only think this negative thing because you lived with someone who taught you to expect that and it doesnt mean its true. It might also be worth trying DBT which has some worksheets for just this kind of issue.

As a teen though he of course developed normally starting to develop his own identity and trying for some independence and she turned on him. How DARE he not be there for her and adore her whenever she needed him and instead try for his own friends and interests? So he became a ScapeGoat.Hes told me a lot of really sad stories about how tough it was growing up with her her temper tantrums her controlling and demanding nature her never being satisfied and usually picking on him and insulting him how most of the family got sick of her cutting them out of her life on a whim then contacting them again a few months later as if nothing had happened only to slam the door in their faces again as soon as she found something else to be offended about.And yet. He can say how badly she behaves and how much she destroyed his life but if I say Shes a narcissist and you need to protect yourself as he had been for the last  years refused to move back home refused their deciding his academic path and career refused their big gifts too many strings attached... well then Im attacking his mother who is dying of cancer and he loves her and wants her to be happy before she dies.I have a friend who has a similar mother and is doing similar things to my friend though not dyyyying of caaaancer so less pressure.

You are not responsible for getting anyone to see these things.Most people work on the first but its harder to get the other ones. Because when you are dismissing other peoples perspectives it can make you feel like you are just being like your Nrents. In my case dismissing other peoples perspectives is like a fulltime job for my Nrents. Arguing is fighting for your perspective.

8953943,0,t3_52spt7,My mom was just here helping us move into our first house and she tried saying my usually normal happy  year old little boy was a demon and that we need to manipulate him until he minds. Now mind you my son does have an occasional toddler fit but come on hes a two year old boy. Some friends of ours came over to help us unpack and eat some chips and such and she was here to let them in while we went to Lowes to buy a few things for the house. Well when we got back and the friends had left she tried saying that our friends who btw the wife is a Certified Nurse Midwife and they have  kids themselves was talking about how horrible our little guy is and that he needs help and if we need any help on learning how to discipline him that we have to talk to them. Funny part is my husband lived with them for two years so he knows how they are and when he went to go to talk to them everything was complete lies as we figured it was. When I called her out on it she just acted like she never remembered any part of this and that it is all in mine and my husbands head. Um no psycho Mommy Dearest its all in your head.

8969420,0,t3_533nsy,You specifically asked for speculation about a medical cause and yes this does sound familiar to us.A dissociative memory issue can behave like this  either the memories dont get recorded generally that only happens when the person is stressed or they get compartmentalized and are only available some of the time.The limiting case when this is a sufficiently strong effect is dissociative identity disorder which we have... and then eventually thought to question whether our nmother also does... and we explained the theory to our father who divorced her decades ago and he completely agreed and had examples we hadnt known about confirming the three people we are aware of in our nmothers system.Its something thats so completely off most peoples radar but unmistakable once you know what it is. And it can be caused or exacerbated by trauma and a cycle of generational abuse certainly creates trauma. So it shouldnt be difficult for you to figure out whether this is the issue for your mother.Knowing what to do once youve figured it out... were still working on that. ,raisedbynarcissists,d7pzlah,2,t5_2we9n

The workplace is like school bullying and twatty behaviour will happen but unless someone is outwardly vile racism violence very obvious harassment etc you cant really stop them and favouritism will always win over honesty.I used to cry daily in the toilets at my last job because of this. Id have N workers shouting at me over mistakes that if someone else made would get shrugged off. I reported it time and time again and nothing was done.Im sorry youre having this experience.

9045759,0,t1_d7z46gq,Yes...if you think about it this is exactly what the N does to their parentified engulfed child. They do everything for the child so they will be dependent and if the kid gets uppity they might pull the rug out from under them and let them fall on their face. This reinforces that the child is dependent on the parent and cant function on their own. If you selfesteem is pegged to a job it can be very satisfying and secure to know that they cant function without you and watching them fall on their faces when you suddenly withdraw support. ,raisedbynarcissists,d7z5m2o,10,t5_2we9n

I was  they orchestrated the marriage literally handed him the ring and then had to live with them because they were helping us so much giving us a place to stay. Nmom tried to break up sisters marriage so she would buy a house with them and they would all live together. NFil talked of buying a large piece of property building a house in the middle for him and MIL to live in then building a house at each corner for each of the grown childrenspouses and kids to live in. It seems to be a common tactic of Ns. The most important thing for you to do is to recognize the crazy and NOT do it.

If your meds dont work then I think its safe to say that you dont have the condition. Also depression is mostly a result of something most likely caused by your mom treating you like this. Being diagnosed with all sorts of mental illnesses would definitely make me depressed and anxious as well. You could of course very well have the conditions but I doubt it. PTSD is definitely caused by something or someone and can be dealt with.If you doubt youre crazy then youre most likely not. Trust your instincts do what you think is best for you because really the only person that truly knows you is yourself. If you feel youre not being treated right then you most likely arent. You can always check with a psychiatrist by telling him or her your story in absence of your mom.By the way read some articles about codependency seems like youre definitely on that side of the spectrum which combined with empathy is probably the reason why you attract narcissists.,raisedbynarcissists,d81myt7,2,t5_2we9n

I focus on those because its easy for me as a bimonthly blood donor to track since the numbers are available to me on the blood centers website.So when Im neglecting to take a brisk walk in the morning or to do my daily dozens I think about my stats and how I need to either improve or maintain my numbers.  It has nothing to do with weight appearance or any of the other things Ive been Npicked about. Side note If anyone here is qualified to be a blood donor I heartily recommend it as a way to boost your morale.  I like it because Im helping people when they need it most the blood bus staff are always supernice to the donors which is really nice when youre down and I get a guiltfree day to eat whatever I want because a pint of blood takes over  calories to replace.    ,raisedbynarcissists,d85x6f3,3,t5_2we9n

Lack of remorse and guilt about causing emotional harm to the target.gt gt . Lower the targets guard through love bombing in the form of excessive showers of flattery adoration and praise.gt gt . Isolate the target.gt gt . Camouflage the hidden agenda intentions and manipulative behaviors.gt gt . Uncover the psychological vulnerabilities of the target to determine what tactics are likely to be most effective.gt gt . Expose the target to mixed messages by alternating love and kindness with cruelty and criticism.gtgt . Manage the target down by creating an atmosphere of unpredictability and chaos which constantly keeps the target walking on egg shells.gt gt  . Erode the targets identity using various forms of ambient abuse such as guilt tripping blameshifting projection gaslighting and triangulation.I personally think Ns come to these methods via learned experience over time.  Theres only so many ways for Ns to get people to do what they want while simultaneously feeding the N supply so all Ns pretty much end up defaulting to the same techniques.,raisedbynarcissists,d8c93q3,2,t5_2we9n

9162902,0,t3_55s5hr,Although I had read about enmeshment before today my therapist put in the perspective of my own family. That my family expected me to align to all of their wishes and opinions and lifechoices was that requirement of enmeshment and the price of refusing it was that they didnt love me. She explained that in normal relationships everyone has their individual space even if the other doesnt support their choices. Knowing this helps me set clearer boundaries for myself and I think for us RBN it is also important to know for how we treat others since we had such poor rolemodels. ,raisedbynarcissists,d8dgqq3,2,t5_2we9n

I mean you learn at a certain age how not to injure people and people throwing themselves on me is one of my pet peeves so this might bother me more than others.I dont think she was gossiping either but I respectfully disagree. When you get pulled in front of your boss for something because you were never made aware it was a problem thats not cool. My lead at my last job did this to me. You arent being a jerk if you pull someone aside and suggest nicely  hey Im not mad but I cant read your mind. Ninety percent of what I see go wrong in every workplace is because people dont communicate.  Its not that I dont get where you are coming frombecause Im not saying I always felt comfortable doing it and sometimes I still dont. But thats my issue.I might be perceived as being overly harsh but I think youre being too nice. Yes its good that you are empathetic but I just hope you arent doing it to your detriment.

I preferred to stay in my room and not interact with any human being than interact with my nUncle.But I also remember one time when I crept out to eat lunch.  I was hunched in a corner of the living room with my food trying to eat as quickly as possible.  I said nothing did nothing but look at my food.Then my uncle takes offense to that comes over RIPS my food from my hands and throws it to splat in the sink.Thats really a moment when I realized I wasnt human to him.  That he could just decide without consequence to tear something that was vital for me not starving out of my hands.  Without being provoked in any way even. The only thing I can think of is he had a spark of guilt at seeing me so wary or maybe just rage that he thought I was portraying him as the bad guy he was and he decided I was to be punished for it.

Therapy is NOT a place to say hurtful things. Some things may hurt to hear but intentionally hurting someones feelings is not okay in any situation. I dont think he will be healthy for the kids for very long. Like everyone else mentioned his behavior will change as they grow older and more difficult to win over. Sending hugs and wishing you the best of luck. If you didnt know this already you deserve to be treated better. If he cant treat you the way you deserve you dont need his toxicity.

9205780,0,t3_56fjib,Courage is feeling the fear and doing it anyway. Have courage friend. You actually have no idea what will happen. And dont worry about it being a rejection  whats the worst that could happen if it is? Youll have to try a different university? A different field? A different direction maybe? None of these things are terrible but whichever one it turns out to be the sooner you start it the better. So you could see reapplying as asking a question as finding out the coordinates of your life right now so you can pick a direction. Its just gathering info about what your options are. I know it feels like a huge deal but I think the best thing I ever learnt from living my own life and not under my Nparents thumb is that mistakes are not only ok but an essential part of life. My Nparents have never in their lives admitted to being wrong about anything EVER... which is why their lives are a ball of crap. As they cant admit to mistakes too busy blaming everyone else they cant learn from them so they never learn how to do better next time. They would rather drive off a cliff than admit to being on the wrong course and adjust their trajectory.My point being if you reapply youll either get in or you wont. If you do great if you dont also great... cos thats one wrong direction youve gotten out of the way. Until youve done it and either succeeded or dismissed it you cant take the next step and youll be stuck in limbo.Dont let fear of failure or failure itself paralyse you. We all fail and we learn from that and subsequent failures teach us more and we get better and faster at solving problems more efficient at changing direction when we have to. Your parents probably made you believe that they never made mistakes and they were perfect and if you werent perfect with no practice or learning or anything just perfect straight out of the womb like them then youd amount to nothing. Lies all of it. Heaps of steaming bullshit. Dont believe it.

Human memory is flawed and between that and the chronic sleep deprivation of parents who have a toddler who still isnt sleeping through the night name mixups happen.

How close a friend gets to be depends on how that person acts and how trustworthy they are. A has shown you over and over and over the kind of person she is. You said it yourself you feel better when she is around less. That feeling is telling you she needs to have an orbit further away from you. That is for your own well being. As for her well being her losing friends is a consequence of her actions. She probably is miserable but thats not your job to fix. Ask yourself if she would drop everything for you and rush over if you said you were miserable? Would she try to make you feel better or would she drag you into drama and gossip to make herself feel better? What she is doing now is called hoovering she trying to suck up back up into her orbit. Ask yourself if that place is a good one for you or do you need to be further out? Im not a therapist I cant say if A is an N. I can say she has some highly dysfuntional behaviors. triangulating passive aggression negging minimizing your feelings that would make her an unhealthy friend.

9445268,0,t1_d9d199e,Is she threatening to kill herself or harm someone else? Either way that is so so hard and I totally get it. Ultimately I feel like giving her money is enabling her and only harming you all including her more. My mother previously attempted suicide and my siblings and I all fear in the back of our minds that she will try again this led my husband and I to let her live with us rent free for  months while she got a job and found an apartment near us. After she and my dad split she moved away and in with her parents got a job an apt lost the job lost the apt moved back in with her parents again got a new job and apt lost them both again moved in with my aunt the cycle continued and once she lost her job again she whined and cried that she hated the state her family lived in and wanted to move back home closer to her kids so we gave it a shot and let her live with us. Sorry for the run on sentence. This ended up being a disaster. She stayed for  months instead of  took  months to get a part time job during the holiday season and when we finally gently kicked her out after  months to move back to the state my grandparents live in to live with them she tried to stay with us longer. We had to put our foot down and Im so glad we did. Once she left we got a bunch of bills from various doctors offices in the area that shed been to seeking prescription antianxiety meds shed been abusing them the whole time and never saved a dime. Left us to drive back to my grandparents in a car with no insurance even! The takeaway here is that people like our moms cannot be helped until they want to help themselves. You guys giving her money could be compared to giving a drug addict money its only hurting her. My mom hasnt attempted suicide again that we know of and  years and several more lost jobs and apartments later is living with my grandparents again. They enable the shit out of her  I am sorry you are going through all of this though its so emotionally taxing to worry about a loved one killing themselves and feeling that youd be partially responsiblejust know that like others have said you are only responsible for you. ,raisedbynarcissists,d9d96ek,3,t5_2we9n

Its safe clean there are more opportunities and my once sick grandmother got treatments for free and is now enjoying a pension allowing her more monetary independence. Yet my grandmother who benefited the most from our immigration likes to shit on Canada whenever she can and it baffles me. She finds Canada expensive and sure it is but its for a good reason. Like the fact that shes not longer sick and were not bankrupted? Because of the free healthcare? But shell complain about that. Also she finds Canada unsafe which is so idiotic. She has never witnessed crime in Canada but in our country of origin we saw our dog get poisoned our car get vandalized and our security guy get badly hurt all in one night. We could have died if it wasnt for the barricades on our doors. Or doesnt she remember that time my school was on lockdown and we all had to lay on the ground all day because there was a shooting outside and again the only thing that saved us was a barricaded door. Crime in our country of origin is an every day thing even the government is on it with mysterious killings and kidnapping. But yes that one guy who stabbed another in a province  hours away means Canada is a crime ridden country. Or shell complain about the weather. Yes lots of snow is unpleasant but Ill take snow over hurricanes and earthquakes any day of the week. Because unlike snow who is at most inconvenient hurricanes and earthquakes are almost guaranteed to destroy property. The list goes on. She will not acknowledge a single good thing about Canada.

9487960,0,t1_d9ii5p9,Oh but foster homes are not the only solution. To be honest in my neck of the woods there are very few foster homes  the only foster child I ever knew about was a school mate of mine decades ago. Here there are group homes which of course are not perfect. But in the cases of parents just being ignorant morons they sometimes straighten up when someone tells them off. Being watched by child protective services investigated by the police sent to parenting classes and mediation by whoever or fined by a judge can help show these people that actions have consequences. First time they get parenting classes next time they get fines whatever. Cleverer ignoramuses would then get the message and stop doing things that might get them in trouble. And the children would get validation that the state has rules that at least attempts to protect them. It of course doesnt work with the more severe cases like yours  but it would be a nice start. Unfortunately the law doesnt really give the protective services the same tools when it comes to nonphysicalviolence.

This is actually something postal workers are allowed to do.  If your number is on the mailing label or if its priority mail with confirmation etc... the letter carrier can try to call you if they a cannot find your apartment b need you to meet them in person for a signature or c have a package that is too large to be left safely at the delivery area.  Most times the post office people just use their cell phone since its whats on them.  In a major city or college town you tend to experience this way more often than other places.  Here is hoping this was a easy one for you and nothing crazy.  In the future whenever you talk to the post office ask for the name of the manager and the badge of whoever their supervisor is.  Document everything down to the minute you called them.  Trying to convince the USPS that someone is tampering withstealing your mail is a uphill battle of immeasurable proportions but when you finally win its glorious.  Mail fraud and theft is a very serious crime once someone believes you its happening Also as far as what to do next Id go to the website and follow the links for missed a package.

Your choice unfortunately is between having no mother but having someone who calls themselves your mother and then continually mistreats you or having no mother and living peacefully.gt Can this relationship really be worked on?It cannot. Relationships take two people. If one party cannot recognize the problem in the relationship let alone participate honestly and equally in working on it then it cannot be worked on. Working on it by yourself really just means erasing or minimizing yourself  and your needs so as to accommodate her.gt when is it time to decide enough is enough?Its enough whenever you feel it is enough. There arent really any rules. The only thing required to end your relationship with your mother is for you to decide you want to do so. One of your fundamental rights is to associate or not associate with whoever you choose. You have the right to end your relationship with your mother for any reason even a bad one.

It turned out it was some protein shake base for muscle building because hes working out and trying to get some gains. But well at least she got the chance to have her emotional breakdown!

9702845,0,t1_d8fvohl,Sorry its taken me so long to reply.  Im fairly new to reddit and didnt know you had replied.  My self love practice started with intense therapy.  I went through a program called PTI Personal Transformative Initiative through the Wellness Institute in Issaquah WA.  There are therapist through out the country who lead these programs.  Through that I became aware of Louise Hay and her book Love Your Self.  This is going to sound weird but she suggests to literally look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourself I love myself I really love myself.  It was really hard at first.  I couldnt even look at myself and say it.  But I kept at it.  I also prayed a lot.   One weekend at PTI I met a man you was so amazing.   He was a teacher of Native American ways.  But his message that weekend was that we are all beautiful and deserved to be loved and we are loved.  He prayed with us and asked that God would heal us and that we would know love and how to love ourselves.  And something amazing just clicked for me in that moment.  After that I had a dialogue in my head that kept saying I love myself and I take care of myself.  I still can be hard on myself but I now see myself doing it stop myself and reverse it with self love talk.,raisedbynarcissists,da930l5,1,t5_2we9n

9710326,0,t3_5e5xu5,You absolutely have the right to set this boundary and stick to it. SHE is  wrong in this and whats more she knows it. Cue the waterworks and the big puppydog eyes and the But Im your MOMMMMMMMY! I WUV YOUUUUUU! Bullshit. Its an act she knows she was wrong she is conditioning you to accept her extremely inappropriate behavior.  Shes sneaking and then manipulating you emotionally to enable her actions and basically enlist you as an enabler in her abuse of you.Your personal space has been invaded repeatedly and wantonly. YOUR peace has been disturbed and your trust broken  repeatedly. No it is NOT normal for one adult to go into the home of another adult without permission when that adult is not there. That is called TRESPASSING. Not even if they bring cake and ice cream and groceries and took you for pony rides as a child. ITS STILL TRESPASSING. The fact she did it after you spoke up used your words told her not to is something that honestly belongs in a therapists office. She needs to ehar from another adult that her behavior was totally over the line and unacceptable and that you are fully justified in protecting yourself from future actions on her part. She CAN and she very much MUST respect your rules in this. It is NOT normal for a parent to enter the separate home of their grown offspring and rearrange that adult persons living space to their liking. Even if they call it cleaning even if it needed cleaning  thats your stuff thats your dirt thats your business and thats your private space and this was not a favor.  THIS was her not controlling her own VERY INAPPROPRIATE impulse. Thats TRULY crazy behavior. Its very much a violation of you as an individual and shows zero respect for your AUTONOMY.Let me give you an example of how very very inappropriate this is what if youd left a sex toy on your bedside table when you went away? What if instead of being away for the weekend you had jsut decided to tell people you were away and were actually spending the weekend in bed with a lover only coming up for air to pay the Chinese Food Delivery Guy? What happens when you have a significant other and your space isnt just YOURS anymore... how do you think a roommate or spouse would feel about your parent coming into their home where they have the reasonable expectation of PRIVACY? How would you feel if their parent of the opposite sex from you started coming through your home and touching your things without your permission and consent? How would you react if they did it multiple times after being explicitly and plainly told not to?So Im guessing that while you dont live with your mother anymore she has a key to your place? How old are you and how long have you been living on your own? Change the locks. Point blank change the locks. Go to your landlord if you have one explain you gave a copy of the key to someone for safekeeping in case of getting locked out and that theyve proven untrustworthy... and change the locks.And dont tell Mommy. Just wait. Wait and see how long it takes before you get the weepy call that she cant get in... it might be when youre at work it might be some day when youre just usually out... but wait for that call. And then use this script The locks were changed as my GIFT to you! Im nice! This is me being nice and giving you a great big LOVE PRESENT! I couldnt help myself I LOVE you so much!! This is me being NICE to you Mom. You see the OTHER option I had was to call the police and press charges for you trespassing in my home so this way Ive now set a boundary that you dont have to rely on your very poor impulsivity control to abide by. You dont get a copy of this key in fact you never never get another copy of another key to my home again. Because if we have ANY relationship we are going to have a HEALTHY relationship with appropriate adult BOUNDARIES and RESPECT for each other. And just like with a special needs child if you need supports in place  to curb your own lack of control I  or law enforcement  will supply them! KISSES! LOVE YOU! SMOOCHIESMOOCH!   and Hang up.,raisedbynarcissists,daa08rl,10,t5_2we9n

I am sure your dad and friends are right that you have nothing to feel guilty about.

Maybe contact wherever is training her ask them about what she told you and ask if thats what theyre teaching and arrange for them to do a family therapy session between you two. Theyll see how fucked up she is and either teach her why she was wrong or shell leave and hopefully never become a therapist! Not really Im horrible at plansIgnore what your sister said  she doesnt actually CARE about you which is fine because you deserve better.

Getting out once you turn  and not living under their roof helps with financial emancipation from them once you go to college so you can be separate from them when you apply for financial aid. Start speaking out. Let the administration at your school know whats going on with you and that your parents do not support your transition. Contact LGBT youth programs in your area to see if they can help with housing when you turn . Get ahold of your personal identification or at least copies if you can and store them with friends.

9884124,0,t3_5gxdke,In my opinion being apart doesnt necessarily end a friendship. Some friends come and go yes but there are different types of friends. Fair weather friends friends that you can rely on when you totally need to hide a body or get bailed out friends you can call up once in a blue moon and go to some event to. I dont think its fair to just say people stop giving a shit once school or work are done because that may not necessarily be the case. Sometimes yes you do drift apart but its not always intentional. And sometimes you find each other again  years down the road. Life is weird.I feel you about being friendless and stuck with a shitty family. Sure Id prefer to have some friends and not feel like Im the only person in the world who sucks at real life friending. It can be lonely at times. But I realized that if the alternative is being stuck with assholes I have the misfortune of being related to Id rather be by myself and yes knowing at least one person cares about me is a comfort. The funny thing is my loneliest moments were had when I was stuck with shitty family desperately wanting to be with someone who genuinely cared about me. Even funnier was that a Narc parent told me point blank that the only person who was going to be good to me was me. It was so true considering how they treated me but Id wished Id grasped the lesson a little better much earlier in my years and GTFO sooner.,raisedbynarcissists,davxbbh,5,t5_2we9n

Know what you may be willing to do as a compromise say structured visits once a month with a therapist or social worker present in a public place for two hours. This shows the courts that you are willing to work with her if necessary. If a compromise is not something you think is ever going to work with her you need to build the case that shes crazy.

9894229,0,t1_dawbyvu,Because bravery is my strongest forte. Im also logical reasonable and mentally strong but on occasion these things go away due to my mental issues like anxieties or depression. But bravery was always there even when everything else wasnt.I also believe it takes courage to fight your demons and not give up and in my entire life even last year at my most suicidal time when I fought the urge for weeks I never gave up. I never stopped fighting. Sometimes I get really tired but I always eventually get up and go on. I think it requires bravery to face the problems instead of ignoring them like I see a lot of people doing. It requires bravery to admit that sometimes you may be wrong or your good qualities might be weaker than you thought.There are tasks that Im scared shitless of and I perform them anyways. There are uncomfortable truths that I admit to myself because I dont want to lie to myself. There are things I know I might not be able to do but I try anyway because I know I should. Sometimes I get into fights that I know I might lose but also I know its the right thing to do to at least try. And I like to remind myself that being brave is a choice you make so it is within my control to keep that courage flowing.Its also a pun on The fairest of them all because I really like Snow White.But mostly it says that because I put it there D,raisedbynarcissists,dax8pd0,5,t5_2we9n

Shes saying the only way she will consider what you have to say is if it is delivered in just this exact way. That forces you to let her have the power if you want to be heard. Oh and its complete bullshit. Ask yourself if she is going to respect your words any more just because they are hand written in paper? Or if shes just trying to get proof that you will jump through hoops for her? This is actually really common for enmeshed Ns when they feel their kid pulling away. They start playing mindgames to prove to themselves they still have that boundaryless connection to their child. My MIL started this little over a year ago with my husband and it has now escalated to actively trying to pick fights over politics just to prove she can still control his reactions.Personally Ive always wanted to to something like write out the whole list save it to a file and everytime the N goes I dont understand what the problem is spam the crap out of them with it.

And thats when enough is enough and you put your foot down. Various scenarios can play out here but they usually end up at the same place. NC. And thats a good thing.This realization can take a lifetime. I was around  when I figured it out. I wish I had known  years earlier. You cant fix something if you dont know why it broke. Now you know you can start to heal and it effects every part of your life in ways you would never imagine. Thats when you discover who you really are and become the person you were born to be.

9986782,0,t3_5ihyk0,I was used to my Ndad yelling at me my siblings my mom for next to no reason. I didnt like it but I thought maybe it was just a harsh reality in life. Like children dying in Africa. It sucks but its still life. Plus some kids at school described having a pickyperfectionist mom or dad and then the other parent would be really chill. So I just thought My Ndad was the picky one and my Emom was the chill one.When I was  I had a group project for th grade history. Since my house was bigger it made sense for other kids to come over to my house. My sister also had soccer practice. My Ndad was really protective of the house. No backpacks in the house it might scratch the paint on the walls or scratch the wood cabinets and no cleats on the wood floors.Well he told my sister to go put on her cleats NOW and meet him at the front door while he got her bag. These were two conflicting demands. He really wanted her to put on her cleats. But she would have to walk on the wood floor to get to the front door. This had happened before. He yelled at her for walking on the wood trying to get to the door before he noticed. I dont know what she did this time but whatever she did he didnt like it.  Started yelling at her so loud you could hear it across the house and through the door me and my friend were on the back porch. Things like No youre not sorry and You never listen its all about you you you. I didnt like it but I was used to it. I didnt even look up from what I was doing. My friend said something. Well call my friend F and me MEF Hey stonesthrow?ME Yeah?F Does your Dad always yell like that?MEYeah. Why?I looked up and the look on her face was a look of terror. She looked like she had just witnessed a murder.Then I thought to myself. Wait...If shes reacting like that then maybe its because shes never seen that before. And if shes never seen that before maybe its because her parents dont yell like that. And if her parents dont act like that maybe other families besides hers dont act like that. And if other families dont act like that maybe its normal to not yell at your kids!It was one of the most amazing realizations Id ever had.

10058746,0,t1_db9ppf0,Right.  I wanted to point out the relative success of doing therapy with an N depends on what your definition of success is  MY definition of success would be the N understanding that if they violate boundaries there are consequences and if they break the law or violate a restraining order the police will be contacted.  I think in that case yeah it might be helpful to bring an N in for a therapy session.  So the N can hear from someone who isnt under their thumb that yeah...their actions have consequences.  Sometimes unpleasant ones.  If youre trying to help fix or change the N then no.  It will not be successful.  It will just be expensive and frustrating and possibly dangerous if you actually live with the N because as someone else pointed out youre giving them ammo to use against you in therapy.tldr  Use any mandatory therapy with an N as an opportunity to have the therapist explain boundaries and consequences.  Do not expect the therapist to be able to help the N or you in dealing with the N.  ,raisedbynarcissists,dbiog9i,2,t5_2we9n

Or perhaps she just doesnt understand that other people yourself included dont have feelings at all. While we could speculate as to what shes really trying to do the best advice I can give is stay true to yourself. You know that youre working hard to be better that you need medications to be healthymanage symptoms and that you suffer from a mental illness perhaps because of your mother by the sounds of it. These are all difficult things to understand and live with and it sounds like youre doing alright with it so far!Stay true to your feelings. You matter and so do your feelings.

Instead we usually take a fun trip somewhere that doesnt involve our families who live on the other side of the country. But we still feel guilty and depressed about exchanging gifts with our abusive families.This year weve been in couples therapy which has allowed us to learn how to communicate better and to make space for each others feelings. This is also my first Christmas NC with my family and the first Christmas NC NmomVLC Edad for my husband.So we decided to reclaim Christmas.We had extensive conversations about what we liked and didnt like from Christmases past and we were deliberate about setting up new rituals around Christmas that were of our own making.We nixed all giftgiving to family members.We made room for the complicated emotions that came up  and there were many  talked about them acknowledged that Christmas is complicated and moved forward.In the end I actually enjoyed Christmas for the first time in years. No guilt. No obligations. Just the things that we wanted it to be.God bless us every one.,raisedbynarcissists,dbnlc4p,4,t5_2we9n

I went LCNC  years ago. NDad and eStepMom never reached out to me and I sure as hell did nothing to encourage it. Moved  miles away and started a new life. Total indifference from these two when their grandchildren were born. Deafening silence when each of their greatgrandchildren were born.It was only about five years agowhen nDads health started to failthat I reached out to family friends to share the news and heard from EVERY SINGLE ONE that they knew or suspected I was being abused. As others have noted no one felt it was their place to get involved. I know its ancient history but I am still disappointed in these socalled friends.My recommendation to you is not to assume how much your relatives know versus merely suspect.

10116999,0,t3_5krsrr,You arent hurting your kids by keeping them away from destructive harmful people. You are harming them more by allowing your parents to abuse them. And i have to say using drugs around your kids saying messedup comments that your kids begin repeating treating you like rubbish in front of your kids  thats all considered child abuse. Here is something you may not have considered yet If someone  a concerned neighbour school teacher or family friend  decided to report you to child welfare for knowingly allowing your children to be around drug dealers you could lose custody of your kids. School teachers and doctors and the like are mandatory reporters  if one or both of your kids mention something to them that sounds concerning to them they are legally obligated to report it. You said in another comment that your daughter was parroting comments like you just want me to die  all you need is for the wrong person to hear that and you are suddenly being investigated. I dont mean this to sound like an attack on you  Im trying to help you see how others might view your situation and what could happen. Yes your older child will be upset about not seeing her grandparents for a while  but its no different to a child crying because they want more lollies candy but you wont let them have it because you know it will make them sick. Children dont know what is best for them and often cry and nag for things that you KNOW are bad for them. The same goes for people. You have to protect your kids from harmful people whether they share DNA with you or not. To help keep your resolve strong perhaps you can write a list or keep a mental list of all the messed up things they have done to you and your children in the past and when you feel yourself wavering review the list and remind yourself WHY you need to stay strong.

I was slightly chubby but not hugely overweight by any means. That was when she started critiquing my meals and eating and nagging me. If I tried to stop eating when I was full I was told to finish my plate. Then when I was  my mother stopped cooking all together. I was left to hot pockets and chef boyardee and soup and sandwiches until I taught myself to cook. My older sister became bulimic around this time. Shed binge and purge and exercise all the time.

The fakeness of it is rageinducing. Youre an adult and theyre treating you like a child. Theres no need to be worried about an adult like that in most cases. Infantilization is enraging IMO. You know something is off because they have other channels of communication to find out if something actually did happen to you. In your case your son or husband could tell them. It was used as a ploy to try to force more contact. Im worried about you travelling to Disney or any other nondangerous location. Call me as soon as the plane lands to let me know youre okay!

What they really want is control his nmom thinks she can control her niece and thus her son so that is the only coin she will accept.My current and sadly only fantasy is finding a genie and getting three wishes ... and offering to use one to cure his mother of her terminal cancer with the only condition that he not marry according to her wishes and if she tries back the cancer goes.

10166328,0,t1_dbvqhq2,Sorry to take so long to respond to this but since it is fairly long I needed to put aside a chunk of time to read it properly.Definitely agree that a support group might help. I only have fairly limited experience in group therapy but found it enormously helpful. In my view it can sometimes be more helpful that oneonone therapy probably because its based on sharing things with others who understand some of what youve been through but also because it doesnt really depend on the quality of the therapist. Its imperfect and youre more likely to get bad advice from someone in the group than from a therapist but that doesnt matter so much because its more collaborative. Youll also get some good advice and youll also have to think about what will work best for you. Thats also what makes RbN so valuable of course.In the long run I think it would also be worth finding an individual therapist you can work with and who wont just offer you meds. But if youre tight for funds that might take time since government programs will tend to push you towards CBT and other quick fixes. But the other things discussed here will help get you to a point where you can make the best use of individual therapy. It always works best with people who have a reasonable idea of what their issues are and want to change.Stick with the writing too. That will also help you to see things more clearly and on the evidence here youve got a talent for it.Good luck!,raisedbynarcissists,dbwequl,1,t5_2we9n

10199823,0,t1_dc06bqp,gt Oh yes absolutely. Everyone else is a wellmeaning valuable person and if anything is uncomfortable its my fault. I mean to some extent it could have been back when I was an awkward angry teen but now its just self persecution. Oh man its bad when we used to be bad because then that doubt creeps in. And for me at least theres always that doubt that I never REALLY changed.. I find I have to just fight myself on that and literally just say no to myself.. but its so damn hard. I was the same awkward angry and worse lolgt Its easiest for me to break out of that when the other person is blatantly hostile but I still have to work on not defending myself to myself and exiting the situation quickly.Yea its really hard. I end up nervous shaky I fake laugh a lot. A lot of the times Ill actually somehow mindfuck myself into believing that they arent attacking me and Ill just somehow.. not see it.. other times Ill just laugh a long and attack myself one level above themgt I loved reading about how you let your coworker sit in the silence that he brought on. Reading what you wrote made me realize I want to be someone who makes people comfortable in their pain rather than easily avoid it. Yes! Yes! Comfortable in their pain I like that. I think that comes from a sort of acceptance.. like this hurts this part of me is really bad but its overall okay?gt For all we know your confident quiet will somehow help this coworker socially. And if it doesnt its a great way to mind your own boundaries which feels great.It definitely got to him I noticed. I think when we start behaving differently everyone starts to see themselves differently Ive done it a couple times and its such a different energy. Like theres a pattern to interacting and then you behave completely differently it shakes everything up and everyone becomes hyper self aware..gt  I need to do more of that for sure.I know but I dont do taking a couple seconds before responding helps. Ive done it a couple times. In therapy my therapist told me about how we have these automatic thoughts and reflexes and we need to wait a bit before acting on them so see whats REALLY us. So when someone speaks to us we pause first. And that feeling of SAY SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING comes but we still need to wait it out.gt Smart smart woman. I get angry like the false self people are trying to cheat at life. Its triggering for me. Me too. I guess growing up around so much fakeness makes us hyper raw to it?gt I wonder what the world looks like to someone whos not brought up to key into those people. Like theyre being silly oh well.

Not coming is a serious option Im not mourning her anyway. Then you have the rest of my family most of whom are fairly traditional and view things like going to a funeral of a family member an obligation. And my father. Emotionally he is a child and like a pet to my mother who does everything she says and believes all her lies while seeing her as the best person in the world even though she always belittles him. He was never there for us he never stopped or limited the abuse and always chose her side but Im not sure if I would want to be as horrible to him as he has been to me. I mean part of him is a six year old. Can you really blame someone who is emotionally a six year old for not standing up to emotional abuse? Hes probably just as much a victim as the children even if he doesnt know it.Going and not doing anything is also an option but one where you have to uphold the facade of her being a good person as we tend to do at funerals and thats something Im not willing to do.

Theyre likely to give you a few months to cool off and then start bombarding you again including sending FMs. Remember that Ns dont understand NC they are only capable of seeing it through their own pov eg. if they stopped talking to you it would mean theyre giving you the silent treatment to teach you a lesson and the moment you relent or they get tired of it or want something from you the silent treatment stops and they act as if nothing happened. Theyll expect you to drop it at some point once youve gotten over your little snit.Not saying its guaranteed to go that way but if you have typical garden variety Ns this would be a fairly typical sequence of events. So just brace yourself for more invasion in maybe  months then at the  or  year mark when they start thinkingsaying You cant possibly have been serious! By that point you might also be more vulnerable cos youll be calmer and maybe curious. Make plans to stand firm when or in case the time comes if possible read your NC letter again if you kept a copy or make yourself some notes now or at least come to RBN and read a bit just to remind yourself why exactly you went NC and not let the faded memories and feelings make you think that maybe you overreacted and should reevaluate.

10371849,0,t3_5oj317,Let me see what I can do to help... In normal families violence shouldnt happen. The most any form of violence should ever occur is infighting among very young children who dont know any better yet not good but still technically normal and light spanking on the buttocks as a form of discipline NOTE this one is HIGHLY controversial but due to its prevalence Id consider it statistically normal. I come from a background in education parents are teachers and I was at one point preparing to be one myself and I will say there is a LOT of crossrole insights between teaching and parenting. If youre a parent or teacher and youre screaming at a child for any reason other than alerting them to imminent danger youre parenting  teaching completely wrong. Mocking a childs emotions tantrum or otherwise is harmful to the childs development. While applying reasonable punishments for acting out isnt inappropriate it in no way should ever be the only measure taken  only if an effort to reason with a child has first failed should punishments for acting on feelings tantrums included be considered. This is a tough one. On the surface a parent taking their childs property as punishment isnt uncommon or unreasonable  punishing a child whos neglecting their schoolwork by taking away a means of entertainment or distraction is perfectly reasonable BUT it should be a temporary measure. Few things fill me with more rage than watching videos of parents destroying a childs belongings outright in order to teach a lesson  the only lesson it really teaches is that those with enough power over someone else can do what they please as toxic and terrible a lesson as can be imagined. Theres a blurry line especially at young ages between play and violence. This one is hard to give clear figures on but its commonly held that by the time kids enter school they should have the language skills to solve their problems without hitting and kicking. Ask any teacher however and theyll tell you thats largely a fantasy  disagreements know no age limit and as long as a child can get what they want through acts of violence or intimidation they will keep doing so. As children develop they try on different social roles almost like trying on clothes or costumes. This unfortunately can include bullying and teasing. For context the only good teasing is the sort between mature adults who understand and respect one another the sort of lighthearted ribbing or funpoking where everyone walks away with genuine not forced smiles. This isnt generally the case between children of any age especially younger ones  most childhood teasing is really just harassment one child trying to get a rise or response out of another pure provocation. I honestly group childhood teasing and bullying in as two forms of the same thing with bullying simply being the more aggressive escalated form. In healthy families children are encouraged to work out their issues and both bullying and teasing are strongly discouraged and when necessary punished. Unfortunately this kind of healthy response is rare... and the nuclear response you describe often not only comes to pass but targets the victim for responding instead of the aggressor or both to appear fair... which honestly is NEVER fair. Yes bathtub photos happen. Respectful parents will keep them tucked away somewhere private... disrespectful parents will drag them out to shame and embarrass their children in front of others. Sibling thievery isnt uncommon especially if children know they can get away with it. Some of this is just kids being kids but it should still be strongly discouraged and punished on a casebycase basis. I cant really speak to this one  my parents went through diets and fads aplenty when I was young resulting in me having difficulty digesting meat later in my childhood. As a general rule though food supplies should be kept healthy and reasonable  not too much junk food but not a complete dearth of anything deemed unhealthy either. Consult a pediatrician for best advice here. It does seem odd that parents would force children onto the floor if there was space on a couch but certain situations kids frequently spilling on expensive furniture may justify it to an extent. Feedback from children about the way the home is run should NEVER be met with the equivalent of if you dont like it just leave. This my way or the highway approach fails to teach children why things are done certain ways and prevents them from maturing in their view of what family is and how to interact with others. To your last question... no thats never acceptable. Parents delegating parental responsibilities including communicating with other parents to children is simply wrong.Hope that helps!,raisedbynarcissists,dcjpm1t,3,t5_2we9n

10401278,0,t3_5owb04,Its very interesting to see how food habits are formed based on how you get or dont get food as a child.  My mom had a VERY unhealthy relationship with food when I was young. She was always on some sort of new fad diet which made me very uncomfortable around food. She would often only eat a bag of peas or broccoli for dinner and a Slim Fast shake during the day. My parents would shame me for what I ate when at home so Id often hide my food when I ate at home.    When I was a teen I was on the free lunch program because we couldnt really afford food for me to eat lunch and dinner. As an adult so I sometimes struggle with overeating and feel the need to eat quickly or hide my food when I do eat.    ,raisedbynarcissists,dcn1v9o,12,t5_2we9n

I dont feel like treating myself well or like to deserve it but maybe the more I treat myself like I am deserving of good things it will start to feel that way. I like that you put a limit its smart.

Would you blame or criticize your best friend if they acted out in a way that was selfdestructive or would you be more inclined to take a look at their situation and understand why they may have acted that way? Does your best friend deserve love and compassion? Try saying the things you would say to a friend to yourself. Or imagine what you would say to a small child if they made a mistake. Imagine what youd say to yourself as a child imagine small innocent you who doesnt understand why theyre being criticized. Youre still learning. You will make mistakes and youre worthy of forgiveness. I am working on acceptance. Acceptance does not mean you condone something but you say there is a reason things are that way or thats how things are right now. You dont even have to say Im working on getting better. My parents are the way they are because they both had abusive parents. My parents are simply not capable of giving love in a full way because they never received it. They dont really know what love is. I am also the product of abusiveneglectfulmanipulative parents. I didnt understand what a loving relationship was like until I made close friends and romantic relationships. I had a lot of dysfunctional relationships on the way sure. Anyway my point is  I act out all the time. I frequently do things that I am ashamed of or regret. Especially toward my parents because they make me feel like a small powerless child again. I hate when I stoop to my parents level. I hate that when I read a description of a narcissist I see so many qualities reflected in myself. The difference between you and your parents is that you want to change. That is worthy of forgiveness. You simply are the way you are right now and there are major reasons for it.

Idk if this is the right way but it is what I do I basically tell my brain to shut up kill that stupid song that has been stuck in my head by imagining myself smashing a radio smack that nagging bitch of a subconscious and tell everyone the party is over. I then focus on whatever has been eating away at me be it the chores Ive been putting off the miscellaneous tasks Ive been wanting to accomplish relationships Ive been wanting to improve uncomfortable confrontations coming up aspirations dreams or what have you. Most importantly I relax. I let it play out how i hope it will happen and let my subconscious kind of take the wheel. There are times when I have to say NO! I want it to be like this. especially with confrontations. Eventually I drift to sleep and the meditation conforms to my dreams one way or another. Sometimes its obvious but mostly its zombies and shit. But I almost always wake up ready to tackle whatever needs to be done. Idk how other people are but even such things as deep cleaning the bathroom or kitchen needs a day of mental prep for me. Its like I dont even have the nerve to face my own messes! I would suggest trying to meditate at different points in the day.

10509385,0,t3_5qhvm3,First of all as a yo there is NO POSSIBLE WAY that you are the reason he lost his job. It also will not be your fault if he leaves. Quite frankly he sounds like an immature jerk who is incapable of admitting to his own faults. Most certainly he is unreasonably blaming you for things that are either not your fault at all or are the results only of HIS unreasonable expectations. If you have a parttime job how can he expect so much of your time to help him work on the apartment? If you did that did you? then he would be the cause of you losing your job. And you dont owe him time.However just because he is most definitely not in the right does not mean that you do not have to live with his bad attitude. So all I can say is try just going along with whatever he says no matter how stupid and wrong it may be  thats just to keep peace. But at the same time try to start saving money of your own whenever you can. Get jobs when you can and build up experience. You may be too young to open a bank account in your own name without a parent just yet but see if you can stash it somewhere. People who cannot admit to their own faults tend to not be very reliable  they dont mind failing because they always blame their failures on someone else just like he is doing right now.

I dont deal with Ed personally but i deal with some other unhealthy thoughts from other obsessivestressinduced behaviors and my best advice is just keep doing what youre doing. the urges will likely always be there in the background but each time you say no be it NO! Im gonna eat this food to help my baby Im gonna eat this food to nourish myself Im not going to let this ED take control again or NO! Im not gonna let her get in my head Im not going to listen to the negative voices. NO!!!! IM AWESOME AND IM GONNA KEEP MAKING PROGRESS it should be easier to not give in. i honestly think youre on a very healthy good path to progress most people assume they have to not feel the urge in order to recover but often that isnt true at all  you feel urges but you just have to wait for them to subside.whenever you feel like your mother is in your head or like you want to count calories or maybe skip a snack etc etc just recognize you have the urge know that it isnt healthy for you or your child to go with he urge and do something healthy that goes directly against that urge so thinking better thoughts not counting calories if you dont have GD or counting them when youre feeling less distressed if you do have GD having a healthy snack ... whatever it is you just need to wait it out and talk yourself down. or have your husband and MIL help if youre genuinely afraid youll fall into negative mindsets,raisedbynarcissists,dczqma1,3,t5_2we9n

10539151,0,t1_dcwwv3y,Sorry been away from my computer for a couple of days.gt the things I do are not abusive and wouldnt be even if it were a huge amount like they claim Correct. The things you do are NOT abusive. The things you have described doing is normal human behavior and part of normal human development as you become an adult. It would be ABNORMAL and UNHEALTHY for you NOT to be doing those things.gt But theirs IS abuse Yes yes yesgt because theyre trying to hurt me. Hurting you is often the result of abuse even though it may not be their intention to do so wellintentioned people abuse too and are most likely to hurt those closest to them so its important to understand the definition of emotional and verbal abuse and recognize it when it occurs. Emotional and verbal abuse is used to control and causes emotional pain and scarring and can also lead to physical abuse. Sometimes its so bad that you actually start believing what your abuser says. You begin to think youre stupid ugly fat or worthless. You agree that nobody else would ever want to be in a relationship with you. Constantly being criticized and told you arent good enough causes you to lose confidence and lowers your selfesteem. As a result you start to blame yourself for your abusers behavior. Examples They humiliate you put you down or make fun of you in front of other people. They regularly demean or disregard your opinions ideas suggestions or needs. They use sarcasm or teasing to put you down or make you feel bad about yourself. They accuse you of being too sensitive in order to deflect their abusive remarks. They try to control you and treat you like a child. They correct or chastise you for your behavior. You feel like you need permission to make decisions. They belittle and trivialize you your accomplishments or your hopes and dreams. They try to make you feel as though they are always right and you are wrong. They give you disapproving or contemptuous looks or body language. They regularly point out your flaws mistakes or shortcomings. They accuse or blame you of things you know arent true. They have an inability to laugh at themselves and cant tolerate others laughing at them. They are intolerant of any seeming lack of respect. They make excuses for their behavior try to blame others and have difficulty apologizing. The repeatedly cross your boundaries and ignore your requests. They blame you for their problems life difficulties or unhappiness. They call you names give you unpleasant labels or make cutting remarks under their breath. They are emotionally distant or emotionally unavailable most of the time. They dont show you empathy or compassion. They play the victim and try to deflect blame to you rather than taking personal responsibility. They disengage or use neglect or abandonment to punish or frighten you. They dont seem to notice or care about your feelings. They invalidate or deny their emotionally abusive behavior when confronted. They make threats or negative remarks with the intent to frighten or control you.gt So they are bullshitting when they say Im abusive and hurting them.Absolutely. They are gaslighting you. I found gaslighting such a strange concept to understand and took me ages to really understand and recognize it. Its an insidious way to manipulate people and incredibly damaging thing to do to someone. It destroys their zest for life ruins their selfworth and confidence and stunts emotional growth.Ive reread your original post and have a another comment....gt I dont feel that I am difficult to live with but just like we impress on people here my feelings about whether she ought to feel hurt dont matter. What matters is she feels hurt. She CLEARLY feels I am difficult to live with regardless of whether I feel I am difficult to live with. What if whatever I am doing to her is as bad to her as the emotionalverbalphysical abuse is to me?Sure she feels hurt but that doesnt justify her behavior. It sounds like she doesnt know how to regulate her emotions and has no coping mechanisms for when things dont work out as she had planned. Her lack of anger management skills is not your problem because you cant fix it. Only she can and she clearly doesnt want to. She responds to stress by lashing out and blaming others instead of making a conscious effort to minimize drama and conflict. This is a very unhealthy dynamic for any relationship especially for whoever is on the receiving end as this is a game she controls and you are not allowed to win.  gt Encouraging rifts between me and my siblings. Telling them Do you want to end up like your sister?Are you the oldest? Im the oldest of  with a  year gap between me and the next one down.

If not figure out a way to get the money even if it means borrowing from friends or a teacher who is sympathetic to your problem. Then gather the documents youll need to prove identity and residence check the dmvs website to see what youll need. After that you need a ride or you need to put on your walking shoes and walk there. Trade reasonable favors or chores with a neighbor for a ride if you need to. Your parents will not be helpful with this.

Many many places have a public health care building with trained therapist and psychiatrists available now usually for a flat or reduced fee and if youre in a low enough bracket you may be able to get that care for free. A good therapist should never talk about themselves or their families and whats going on theyre being paid to listen to YOUR issues not gossip about theirs. And if all else fails there are free hotlines available that you can look up and talk to someone.

A narcissist will noteverseek treatment. If they are forced to go to treatment by family or by court order they almost always walk out during the first session and do not return. A narcissist will not ever accept they have N traits because they dont believe they do. That being said its entirely possible she has FLEAs picked up from her parents or other authority figure. FLEAs can be managed with therapy. Look in the sidebar links to learn more. The really really bad thing about FLEAs is that you dont know you have them until some life circumstance rocks your world and you dont know how to react.

Write Derp on the front and every time you freak out about something figure out what the skill or question is thats behind it that you feel you dont have and go get the answer and write it down.  Thatll reassure you that yes you are making progress that these things boil down to concrete things with concrete answers and look at all the things you have control over.

Once after I told them that I did not need a resource person I WAS the resource person lol if you got an aspie you know my pain! I ended up with social workers on the doorstep because my youngest hadnt been able to get the cap off his juice. They said I was preventing him from getting proper nutrition. I suggested that had one of the FIVE FUCKING ADULTS IN THE ROOM opened his juice for him when he had asked he would have been able to drink it... But in the end I had to sign a paper promising to only send juice boxes... Sigh. And one of their favourites was to say my children smelled bad. We did do laundrybathe in hard water sometimes it was a little sulfuric or what have you... But nobody else at all ever complained and I ASKED A LOT because this drove me wild. Finally a social worker showed up and I refused her entry to my home on account of how badly she smelled. Told her that she would need to go home bathe out on some clean clothes maybe she could use some mild deodorant product?Poor girl. She was flummoxed and confused and freaking out.So I relented and pointed out that it is an indefensible accusation. You can SAY you bathed. That your clothes are clean. But if someone else says you stink... You stink. There is no way to say This makes no sense. You are smelling something no one else is smelling and theres no logical way its offensive  if they say they smell an offensive smell then they smell an offensive smell.

10651704,0,t3_5sek97,I know exactly what you are talking about because I always wondered about why I saw people for who and sometimes what they are when everyone around me seemed to be entirely clueless. I remember my Nmother constantly hired awful people to work for her when I was growing up.  Being an N rendered her and her Nhusband entirely oblivious to these peoples hidden motives. But me at a very young age saw these people were bad. I warned my parents that i did not like them but my parents ignored my warnings because these employees were charming and fed my parents egos. As a result my parents have repeatedly been victims of embezzlement and fraud by their accountants bartenders they own a restaurant waiters  and the other sociopathic manipulators that they have foolishly allowed in their lives. You are probably high on the empath scale and just see something in peoples eyes. I cant describe it but I know what you are talking about. Because you are empathic you can feel the emotional devoidness not sure if this is a word in certain people. Something is just off to you. I completely relate. On the flip side you can identify people who are genuinely good and kindhearted. You are also probably very hard to manipulate and not easily conned by people. This is certainly a gift of being an enlightened ACON. I will say that I know plenty of ACONs who are entirely oblivious to the manipulators in their lives but these are usually the ACONs who have never processed how truly abandoned they were as children. They sort of accept boundary crossing and abuse as its normal behavior. I have a sibling who worships her Nfather my stedpdad when in reality he has never once shown a care in the world for her and constructively abandoned her when she was a child he is the rejecting sort of N. ,raisedbynarcissists,dden3ij,11,t5_2we9n

I mean I see plenty of people everyday who do the same stuff I do and have way more social ability than me. See the thing about the hospital or the red cross is they want someone at least with a nursing degree. Other internships have much more lax requirements. A college degree is useful but it doesnt magically get you a job which you know already. You have to keep trying. It can take a year or more of applying to get a job. Someone very close to me only has his HS degree and works front desk at a gym. He used to be one of the most antisocial guys I knew.gtAnd these are people that have a social network to support them so they never get depressed and live in good environmentsYou are incorrect here I grew up with an okay social network in a poor environment and I got depressed a lot. I still do but I have more resources now. I know a multitude of people who have the best social networks and the best environments they could have who still get depressed. What are you interested in? Im sure there are youtube videos or websites or all sorts of resources that you could use to improve yourself.

My mom is the exact same way. Anytime I started to put a toe out of line shed start threatening to stop paying for things. It kept me under her thumb for a long time. Haha one of the things that she lost her shit over was me piercing my nose. Your story reminds me so much of my own. Trust me theyre not doing this for your benefit theyre doing it for their benefit. Theyre literally paying you to give them control over your life. It will be difficult to break away from this but its possible. Adult expenses add up so quickly and there is so fucking many of them and you need to build up credit and it can be very overwhelming. But it is possible. Start tracking your expenses and spending meticulously. Ive heard great things about the software called You Need a Budget ynab for short. You can also check out subreddits like rpersonalfinance rfinancialindependence and Im sure theres more. Youll need to establish credit. They cant dangle money over your head and make you jump through hoops to get it if you dont need it. I cant emphasize this enough theyre paying for things for their benefit not yours. They seem to like the idea of having a daughter but they dont seem to like the reality of having you as their daughter. And thats really sad and unfortunate because you are a good and cool person. You dont fit perfectly into their idealized version of what you should be so in order to force you to conform to what they want theyre using money to force your hand. They dont want you. They want compliance. Im so sorry for saying it so harshly but its true. You deserve to be your own person and to live your own life how you wish. You deserve to be loved for who you are not because your mom can use you for bragging rights to her buddies. ,raisedbynarcissists,ddm9qzm,11,t5_2we9n

10767576,0,t3_5u1d8k,In a word anger.Doubt and anger are polar opposites in several ways and they make for excellent counterpoints to nullify the other. When you know for example that your family treated you badly but doubt begins to creep in and make you wonder if you deserved it get angry. Focus on a point in your memory where you were justifiably outraged by their treatment of you  capture the scene replay it in your mind try to feel what you felt then and remind yourself of the emotional reality and personal cost of the things theyve subjected you to. Then when your anger is at a nice steady simmer reexamine the question of if you deserved that kind of treatment. Youll see much more clearly that you dont.Doubt is a function of guilt and guilt is based upon the principle that weve wronged someone or something in the case of beliefs and ideals that did not deserve to be wronged. When doubt is unmoored from its basis  that is conviction or relationship  then guilt tends to spin in circles prompting more doubt more guilt... the whole thing feeds on itself like the ouroboros and doesnt end up going anywhere. To break the cycle the first thing you must acknowledge is the broken foundation that the conviction or relationship that your guilt and doubt is trying to point towards isnt there anymore and maybe never really was at all. With that out of the way you can begin to analyze and dissect the misdirected sense of unease and bring it into alignment with the truth you know.,raisedbynarcissists,ddqlgee,15,t5_2we9n

I dont look people in the eye now. I avoid looking at peoples faces at all costs because it feels like Im surrounded by people that are ready to snap on me at any moment  all the time. I even have trouble making eye contact with my fiance the sweetest man in the world who has never been angry at me over anything.Im really hoping I can get past this eventually. ,raisedbynarcissists,ddv9n7h,7,t5_2we9n

Its really hard to let go of our parents because they are the only ones weve got even if they never actually gave a crap about us.... cultivating a close group of supportive friends and lots of therapy seem like the best ways to cope.You might want to also set a selfimposed time period of No Contact say like two weeks or two months and see how you feel at the end.

10816978,0,t1_dds5bcs,gt If even just one person had said something maybe I could have woken up before . I try not to think about what I could have accomplished with my life if I had figured it out sooner. Its a wasted effort and just hurts so I try to live as authentically as I can now.Thank you so much for the entire post but especially this part.  I feel exactly the same way.  I realize in hindsight that throughout my life anyone who figured out my parents were huge Ns were pushed out of our lives by the Ns who would crusade against them effectively leaving me without any outside support and in their crazy N environment for far too long.  I understand completely how it feels to have to fight for your reality because others dont want to see the narc around them for who they really are.  They more or less just want to avoid rocking the boat but thats the attitude that keeps this dysfunctionality going for generation after generation.  Im not saying that everyone who is aware of the truth needs to spend their life campaigning against the Ns but the moments you take to do little things like making subtle suggestions may be helping that person more than you know.  I wouldve given anything when I was younger to have one of the many people who figured out my parents drop hints or pull me aside or whatever to at least make the suggestion before disappearing to at least introduce the idea that the insanity I grew up in was not normal so I could at least start taking baby steps toward a healthy life back then.I also completely understand how refusing to go back into the closet can leave you feeling alone.  Ive pretty much had to go VLC with my family which will be full NC for some and VLC for others once I move in a few months.  I also had to end a relationship and a friendship over it as well.  Learning about narcissism changed my life for the better in terms of finally having answers to so many things and begin to heal but it also left my life in a scorched earth state in some other ways bc so many in my life are Ns and I just will not have it anymore.  So until I move Im pretty isolated.  But I do look forward to building a healthy family of choice once Im settled elsewhere so that keeps me going! D,raisedbynarcissists,ddvp16z,2,t5_2we9n

10844428,0,t3_5v1ejh,Yes! I noticed this when my son was born. At the time I thought she had changed but I realized she was just trying to steal the baby from me creepy shit like asking a newborn if they love grandma the most... he cant even answer you.... When I started blocking her efforts she went right back to being abusive up until I moved out. She didnt give up on taking him then but Ive been able to shut her down any time shes tried anything weird since thank God shes afraid to be involved with the law in any way because that threat puts her in line real quick.ampnbspOnce I was gone she was alone with my brother he was GC then got cast aside for my son but hes back to GC now we dont live with her. She doesnt bother contacting me unless she wants to see her grandson which is usually around the  week mark of not talking to me at all and probably only so she can make my brother drive her to my house a mere one hour away. She can drive just fine she just likes being chauffeured around. Ugh..ampnbspBut yes OP when a narc finds an easier supply they tend to forget about us. Im of the opinion they do this because they feel they have such good control over us they can plate us and come back to abusing us whenever they want. Which is great because then we can disappear without them noticing before its too late.  Thats my plan for while shes distracted with my brother right now. Just gonna slowly disappear forever...ampnbspThats not how it is though. The problem didnt go away theyre just too busy to abuse you. Eventally the new supply loses its luster usually because they get creeped out in my experience and if they dont find another replacement they will come back for you.

In gratitude my cousin jumped in helping my Ncubator with everything outside what I was doing. Then this happenedampnbspNcubator and step perv are kind of nasty slobby people and because of it Im an OC neat freak.

Not one of them ever thanked me for busting ass to get their eating quarters sanitary...it was bitch fest.ampnbspI decided well fuck all yall then...clean up your own damn house. I wasnt doing anything else. Not long after my cousin washed a load of dishes and swept the floor.

10980157,0,t3_5wqdiw,This part of gaining independence can be extremely hard  its often the hardest part of recovery from nabuse. I had something similar happen to me. Kudos to you for having the courage to distance yourself from her toxicity!A couple of things to remember right now and tips to look into Your moms behavior is not your fault. In the average family a nineteenyearold who doesnt live at home shouldnt be essentially stalked by his mother. You have every right to be independent and go on your own phone plan and pay your own way through life. You also dont have to have contact with her. That nmanipulation and the sense of responsibility to her that I imagine she gave you can be really strong but youre not obligated to her. Youre not obligated to communicate with her and even if it doesnt seem feasible youre allowed to ignore her calls and messages. You do not have to be alone in this. I know that when I went NC with my mom I felt like I was doing it all on my own. Youre not. Youre in college and I imagine there are resources like counseling or a few professors that you could turn to for support I highly recommend counseling if your school offers it itll give you some awesome coping skills for stuff like this. And I bet you have friends and maybe some nonFM relatives that can be there for you. Take all the support you can give  most people do it because they love you and want you to succeed not because theyre trying to get something from you like an n would. Dont forget to be forgiving to yourself. Your nmom is mad as hell but thats doesnt mean you should feel that way too. Youre not the keeper of her emotions  just yours. Make sure that your needs are met. Get mad at her cry about the situation write down all the nasty thoughts and remind yourself how far youve come and how proud you are because youre doing better than you might think right now.All the best!edit  formatting,raisedbynarcissists,decked3,5,t5_2we9n

I dont know how to work on that right now. My intuition is sharper than its ever been which is good news. My problem is I do ignore red flags and straight up deny their existence to myself. I feel I should have known that this guy I dated was a sociopath and deep down I probably did but because Im so emotionally disconnected right now afraid manipulated or whatever it is I didnt access that important information to make a decision straight away to nip it in the bud. Does that make sense? I dont know why I was lying to myself. Maybe doing that does recreate that familiar dynamic Im used to and its hard to break out of that. I need to remember that I deserve love and kindness not to be mistreated. It only lasted two months before I ended it which is better than two years. Im slowly getting there.Its so scary watching people mess with you and you feeling so powerless and paralyzed unable to respond to it. That really terrifies me. I used to stand up for myself a lot more. I developed that hard coat of armor early on in life but it was stripped from me at this current job. It was probably a good thing in some crazy way. My ego was blown to pieces. In a strange way all of this bullying has taught me how to be humble empathic kind more loving and more caring of others.

Im already in the process of handling the situation and hes just being a whiny pissbaby about not being able to use my money whenever he wants.Also youre right about him being next of kin which is what I always assumed would be the case anyway.

11132272,0,t3_5yxglq,Ok heres what I believe about your post my friend.First some red flags in the way you write I dont mean to disrespect her I know that some people feel guilty for not liking their mothers it seems like you fall into this category. Mate if someone abuses you it is fine to be pissed off at them you dont have to worry for being a bad person. Someone linked something like that to me a while ago it is a tell tale sign of ABUSE I hate my mother... am I a bad person?. Anger is actually healthy I dont mean RAGE as in something uncontrolled but it is like this if someone punches you your body will feel pain. If someone abuses you your mind will feel anger. Thats healthy.Second it seems like your mother is fucked up. She never even helped you in the suicide thing. Man I am on the internet all the time just helping people random people if it were my own sondaguther Id be the first to help out. And she does not care?? what the hell? She even called you fucked up for doing that. I mean thats torture man. Thats hitting a man when he is down. Imagine if I saw a person who had just took a beating from a gang and Id come up to him while he was down and Id call him a pussy for crying laughed and went away. Thats how I see that situation.Look my friend this is what I have learned. Your gut deep down knows. THATS WHAT YOU POSTED IN HERE. You know what she did to you is not right... it is just in your mind tho. Emotions take a long time to catch up. Emotions are very slow compared to thoughts. You know what she did was wrong you just have not internalized it. You may come back to her all the time keep talking to her and what not but you may find that one day you will realize pehaps it is best to just leave. Even your username perhaps reflects her abuse to you. You may rethink if you really do love her. Children naturally love their parents yes but what you feel for her may not really be love.Sorry if I sound a bit harsh and angry been like that lately take it all with a grain of sand will you mate. Really trying to help here because Im in the same exact place as you are and I feel your pain!Peace hope I made some good points. ,raisedbynarcissists,dettzol,2,t5_2we9n

11187361,0,t3_5zkua0,Hi OP I can see through some of your comments that you plan on calling CPS again when you get the chance. Would you be comfortable showing them all of your posts on Reddit? Because youve said that they dont believe you. But maybe if you can show them that this is something youve been consistently talking about for over a month with multiple posts and multiple comments that youve posted they might be more likely to believe you and start to take you seriously. Even the comment of your parents breaking the mug that the CPS worker used. All these posts and comments are evidence in a way. The only thing Im not sure about is if you do show them I dont know if they would bring it up to your parents. I know RBN has been really helpful to you and I wouldnt want this place to get taken away from you. But I do feel like showing CPS your posts would give you the extra back up you need.  If CPS actually took the time to look through your posts and a lot of the comments on here they could see that this is a healthy helpful environment that you have been desperately reaching out tobecause no one else is listening. And not just some dumb Facebook crap that a bratty teenager is venting on. Im really sorry for what youre going through. I hope that you can get the help that you need. Edit I was just thinking about the fact that CPS didnt believe that your parents could be racists because of how nice the house looks and how nice they were or whatever. But maybe you could take a picture of Creepers tattoo. Do you think he would let you take a pic with permission? Maybe you could act like you like it or something and say you wanna take a pic of it. Cuz then you could show that to CPS as even further proof that your parents really are crazy racists and proof that theyre grooming you and forcing you to be in a relationshipmarrying this crazy racist guy. You would hope that after seeing enough evidence put together they would believe you. And I know its not  solid proof. But it might be helpful.

11198832,0,t3_5zqzig,Just a quick vent to make... NMom had another trivial tantrum tonight...Usually Nmom comes home from work around  p.m ish... Sometimes sooner sometimes later. Today it got to be  p.m. and she still wasnt home. I figured she must have gone out grocery shopping or something... Turns out it was a hair appointment... But I got a text from her all of a sudden telling me to take a red container out of the fridge that had meat in it to thaw it out... For dinner im assuming. So I did it and texted her back that I did it. She thanked me that was that.Well then she came home about an hour later and looked at me my dad and brother sitting on the couch and asked did you guys make anything for dinner?... We all looked at each other confused... Usually she makes dinner and the only instruction I got was take the red container out of the fridge with meat in it to thaw it out... So I responded umm no and she immediately got mad and said you didnt put anything on? Not even last nights pasta left overs?... Again we all looked at each other confused neither of us knew we were expected to do anything for dinner... So she immediately goes into a tantrum about having to do everything around here... WTF was going on!? She didnt even tell any of us to make dinner or put the left overs on... And she could have texted me at any time to say put the left overs on thats what were having for dinner she knew she could contact me... But no instead she set up this expectation wed make dinner without telling us and got all mad at us as if were fucking failures for not reading her mind...We pitched going out but she got all passive aggressive NO! Ill make dinner dont worry! Sit back down!... So she gave all of us the cold shoulder for the rest of the night she was so disgusted with out perceived failing as a family that she couldnt even be in the same room as us... She hid upstairs and anytime she came down to get anything she had this nasty sour ass look on her face that was supposed to make us feel guilty... She got pissed at all of us individually and as a group...And at the end of the day none of us did anything wrong... I got so close to confronting her and calling her out but my Nmom argues like a toddler and relies on deflecting personal failures on whoever shes arguing with to make them feel guilty when she knows shes in the wrong so I didnt even bother.

On top of that she was always complaining about never having enough money for her property taxes. Like every fucking month they are only due twice a year. I have no fucking clue what she did with the  she got from me every month because I bought all the groceries too and paid for everything for her anytime we went anywhere together out to dinner etc. She was getting social security payments from an annuity rent money and free food living a house that is paid off but she was always poor and I was always lazy. She also gave me a ton of shit for getting in debt because I make good money I should have been more responsible.

Also that they left their kids with grandma who was losing it. This is being pushed onto you. Now Grandma will probably be more confused by your visit than helped. You mentioned you are trans. Ive witnessed some trans interactions with relatives who have dementia and it is never good. At best she wont recognize you at all. At worst you will be misgendered your old name will be used and no amount of redirecting will help. Putting the stabbing thing aside which honestly is a good enough reason not to visit in my opinion you have several reasons not to go. Family or not. As sad as it may be the only person who will know you were there is you or whoever goes with you. Im all for visiting dementia relatives. Dont get me wrong. Ive also had my residents tantrum an hour after their kids leave because their family hasnt visited them in months. They dont remember unless the visits are often in advanced dementia. If its early which I doubt based on your stab story then visiting is encouraged. Im sorry your parents are putting you in this situation. ,raisedbynarcissists,df8zrl5,9,t5_2we9n

This post will help people see that NO there is a whole WORLD of abused Indian children who ARENT wrong because they have nmothers whodestroy their lives and it is not their fault. I have been screamed at slapped and kicked countless times and been told that I am a curse who has come to destroy the family and to end everyone. At that point uttering a single word like you will go to hell for this or GOD is watching what youre doing would trigger further physical beating and screaming. I have also been thrown outside the house and onto the driveway for hours many times. They are brainwashed like no tomorrow. I CANNOT EXPRESS THIS IN MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD TERMS. They THINK THEY ARE GOD. My steps have been to realize that she is not my well wisher no matter what she or the culture says because a well wisher wouldnt end up causing me mental problems. I am a depressed anxious and scared person today who cannot adjust in the world because of this piece of filthy shit.

Ifwhen I have kids they will be on this Earth far longer than I will and I would want them to get as much happiness as they can in life because there are a lot of mean deceitful people that do wicked things so they deserve whatever they achieve.

It drives me crazy when people tell me that all the Christians whove screwed me over had good intentions. Religion is an excuse for nothing. If I have kids bad medical advise based on the Pastafarian scriptures no one would defend me. The kid gloves need to come off when the bad things that religious people in the States domaybe then things would change or the martyrdom complexes and sainthood speeches would be deeper entrenched. Fake Christian teachers cheat kids out of an education they are entitled to fake counselors gaslight victims and potentially exacerbate a bad situation and play into the abuse cycle fake financial advisors make people get screwed with their Biblical accounting crap.  In a first world country people should not be dealing with shamans. And no offense to anyones faith but that is exactly what it is when religion subsumed something a certified professional should be treating. All the good intentions in the world do not change that.

11398208,0,t1_dfnuzb9,Stress blocks the formation of memories. Sometimes there is nothing to recall because it wasnt stored right but you can recall the stress and some snapshots. Even if these snapshots all start blurring together thats because theyre never stored individually as memories. They are stored as stress responses. Which doesnt invalidate abuse.And all memories are recreations to some extent. If all you can remember is this big tangled ball at least youre remembering the right emotions. I think the mind does this for two reasons Putting them all together means you will react to anything that triggers them with a survival response and you dont have to relieve each one in little wounds that add up. So small memories of major stress are a poor function. Major stress and no memories serves all the right evolutionary purposes. Which sucks for memories. See my only other post here I remember the books I read. Reading books calmed me down maybe thats why I only remember my self care methods and not why I needed them.Im going to start trying to see it as not not remembering a childhood like other people but remembering an abusive childhood in the only sane way. ,raisedbynarcissists,dfnz0ca,5,t5_2we9n

11408420,0,t3_62taco,I have admitted to you that I am a narcissist have apologized to you over and over again for all of the mean and nasty things a Mom yes a drunk Mom says to a defiant rebellious teenagerGod why wont you get over those things I said to you. Like Ive apologise SOOOOO much and like its a totally normal way for a mother to treat her child anyway so I dont think I should apologise anyway and you were defiant and rebellious so you clearly deserved it.If you are committed to trying to make this work anyway then heres some advice. If not then no reply or something short and meaningless worksSo you might want to start by calling her out on that. Its insulting for her to imply that all parents treat their children like she did. Insulting to you to minimise and insulting to good parents who try hard.Admitting that she has a problem is a start but it by no means fixes everything. If an alcoholic admits they are an alcoholic great but it doesnt give them a free pass to continue drinking and claim that everything is fixed. Equally an apology is only meaningful if it includes an intent to not continue the behaviour and preferably a plan to make sure you dont. My dad always used to just apologise without knowing why the other party was upset and with no intention to change. To this day it just makes me more angry and hurt if someone apologises without explaining to me how theyre gonna change their behaviour or an explanation of why this really was a one off event due to some outside effect. not the healthiest I know but Im working on it As for your current choices. Dont even think about defending moving in with your bf. This is about her and her past behavior and how unacceptable it wasis. How she needs to apologise and what changes need to be made to move forward. Explain how your reasons for dropping out were depression caused in large part by her. you dont need to justify it as the best choice for you though it sounds like it absolutely was Explain in detail what actions of hers lead to depression in you.Finish up with a short punchy bit about I cannot forget how you raised me it is a large part of who I am today. If you want forgiveness then you need to show me that you understand the gravity of your actions that you truely regret your behaviour and that you are willing to work on creating a healthy dynamic with me as we move forward,raisedbynarcissists,dfp4qdq,2,t5_2we9n

It slowly built up rage that I had no way of releasing from being abused by my mother and father. My dad was more passively aggressiveneglectful so I thought he wasnt so bad. As a young kid I was diagnosed with Autism but now I realize I had ADHD anxiety and PTSD from an early age. All I needed was to let off some steam at times but I was forced away from any coping mechanisms I had and didnt know how to describe how I felt. I didnt tell the kid psychiatristspsychologists they brought me to about the intrusive thoughts because I worried theyd think I was nuts and I saw them as an extension of my parents. And I was aggravatedfrustrated by my parents behaviour so I thought Id never get heard and would just be punished. I was right. From about  years old I was smarter and more capable of logic than them but they would never seem to listen or take me seriously.      After my parents divorced when I was  or so and I started getting more agitated I was put through a lot of mental health facilities put on antipsychotics and all kinds of drugs and treated like complete shit and a crazy out of control beast.

11523546,0,t1_dg16nt2,Yep. This advice is spot on. My Nmother actually did have a psychotic episode.  The police had been to our house before when she set the house on fire because of an argument with my dad when she broke every dish in the house because of an argument with my dad and when she tore shelves off the wall and smashed these beautiful teacups because they were haunted or possessed. When my dad called the police because my Nmother was hearing voices telling her to kill me and my newborn brother they immediately believed my dad when he said she needs help NOW. She was committed to a state hospital for  months. She was still a shitty person and mother after that but my point is that people attempted to get her some help because she was scaring them with her behavior. Huh I just realized the teacup thing happened right before my brother was born so maybe she was already having hallucinations at that point. Interesting. Anyway if the police come out again keep repeating that you were afraid of her afraid for your safety and your sisters safety afraid of bodily harm that this behavior is new and unusual and escalating and that she physically changed during the episode eyes glassed over weird voice etc. These can be signs of a very serious very dangerous situation. This might give the police enough ammo to have her held and evaluated for  hours. Ammo was probably a poor choice of words there sorry.,raisedbynarcissists,dg2727y,4,t5_2we9n

Good to know thats an actual thing. Narcissists love a certain kind of therapist. Most therapists of good repute will not fall for it and will instead opt to see both people alone first or to refer one of them to someone else.Narcissists are great at making up masks to wear. They spend a lot of time dreaming up different ones. Then they put them on and see everyone react to the mask as if it was real. This is kind of a game but its also part of their ability to inflict pain on others as a way of transferring it away from themselves.That pain offload is very critical for narcissists because they are tricking their own minds into giving them some relief. But it never works. The pain resurfaces when they are bored or triggered.And then it comes back stronger.gtI should add too that my husband will block them and he feels bad about not doing it when I first asked. He is always supportive too and I am happy to have him. Oh that is so good to hear. I was really worried for you for a moment there because narcissists are great at ruining our relationships since they get in the way of the orbit unless they can use the relationship for their advantage somehow.gtI am sticking to NC it does seem like they are just bored andor out for vengeance.

I dont remember a time when she didnt take them. Anyway we were sitting outdoors visiting. She had one more week to go and her caregiver and I were there to take part in their family program amazing btw and she was doing everything she could to sabotage us and get us to take her home. At this point in time shed be threatening suicide for years. I was sick of it but hadnt yet found RBN and didnt really know how to handle it. So were talking and arguing about why we wouldnt take her home when she says Well maybe Ill just kill myself.  I told her that threat no longer held any power. She was taken aback and replied What do I have to do?  Kill myself?  I sat back and put out my hands and gestured now you get it.  She was completely flustered. Needless to say she stayed and we did the week long program.  And I have not heard a suicide threat since. Its been over  years. A bit of background when we got there she was bitching and wanting to leave so I went in and talked to a counselor and they put me on the phone with her counselor at a kid party on his day off and he took my call! he gave me quite a few tools to deal with her in a short time. I went back out armed to the teeth and countered her every argument. It was a hoot but I kept a straight face. When we got in the car her caregiver went nuts. She was so thrilled at my performance. We had a nice dinner that night basking in the glow of my win. My Nmom had another surgery today. I hope we dont have a relapse with the pills.

11621628,0,t3_65ueo2,Narcissists often engage in magical thinking in which they imagine how they want a scenario to evolveplay out then they tell everyone that this is whats going to happen. Theyre partly engaging in delusional confirmation bias if I tell everyone thats whats happening and they repeat it back to me then it HAS to happen that way and partly in subtle manipulation if I tell everyone whats going to happen she wont DARE contradict or argue with me and Ill get my way because shell be worn down from everyone telling her whats going to happen. For whatever reason your father has chosen to believe your mother. There is nothing you can do about this as this is a decision he has made and youll waste precious time and energy working on a lost cause. Focus your energy on finding a new home for you your SO and your new baby and ensuring your safety. I say that last bit because your mother sounds like she might cause considerable trouble later on. She seems fixated on getting hold of your baby and since neither I nor you know how far she will go to achieve that I encourage you to get as far away as you can and ensure she cant interfere or try to take your baby. Plan where youll have the baby and who will be notified when you do. If you dont want her anywhere near you make sure the hospital security and nurses know some people have given the hospital photos of the unwanted person so they know them by sight and not just name. Put your family on a strict information diet. Information is power so the less information any of them has the less able they are to meddle.

11774567,0,t3_67xwme,My grandfather was chairman of what was at the time he worked there a fortune  suit company.  Understanding formal menswear is kind of ingrained in me at this point.The good news is formal menswear is WAY easier to understand than womens formal clothing.  Way easier.The gist of it is get a solid colored suit black is your best bet have it tailored by somebody who isnt cheap.  You dont want your rear pockets meeting in your ass crack.  Buy a white collared dress shirt have a sales associate help you find one that fits.  Get a pair of leather dress shoes.  A sales associate will help you find ones that fit.Its way less scary than your Nmom makes it out to be.  And most people cant even tell how much the suit youre wearing costs.  Your Nmom sounds like the type to yell at you for a  suit anyway.  So its not like you can use her as a meter for suit quality.If you want more detailed information about suiting this website is very good.,raisedbynarcissists,dguok94,1,t5_2we9n
11775586,0,t1_dgtzaqw,gt Never about me or the funeral or what I was going through with my daughters. She texted me about her doctor appointments.This makes me RAGEY. I am SO SORRY she is a piece of shit. SERIOUSLY. That is straight up ridiculous.I am so sorry for all of your suffering over the last several years and for losing your husband and for not having parents who could support you through such a hard time. My heart goes out to you.I hope that the silver lining here is that you finally see her for what she is and move forward without her improving your life in the process because you no longer have to try to make your relationship and her something it isnt.Hugs if you want them.,raisedbynarcissists,dgusr3v,8,t5_2we9n
11782653,0,t1_dgvklgj,Im not unprotected my husband is a police officer as are all these guys who know he is leaving. I own and operate firearms and have a security system and a German Shepard who is not fond of men. If I needed my FIL and MIL are fairly close. I think if police officers are going to try to target me Im in trouble either way. I dont think it was that kind of a situation and many of the police families have offered their support. I think hes just a jerk and couldnt grasp that not everyone has a huge Hispanic family to rely on. ,raisedbynarcissists,dgvloee,2,t5_2we9n

She is not a yeller or name caller yet her particular brand of Narcissism sucks the life out of me.  Reduces me to a husk of my former self.I have been NC for  years.  ,raisedbynarcissists,dgwt0fa,27,t5_2we9n

11795642,0,t3_688ept,I developed this gut feeling that something was very wrong with my relationship with my mother. Nay perfect. It was weird because I was conditioned to believe that we had a loving relationship. Yet when I sat down and wrote out my feelings they were disgust violation wanting to puke feeling gross in my sexual center. I eventually learned a name for what she did to me Covert Incest.I sent my parents an email saying I was taking a break from the family for a while. So guess how she responded to that? My birthday comes up a few weeks later and she emails me asking when I want to have my party. I reiterate that I am taking a break and not to contact me. Immediately after that I get a phone call from her. I listed to the voicemail later and she acted clueless. I can see now that faced with a boundary she was simply compelled to steamroll right over it.Since then every few months I get an email with the manipulation du jour of the month. Im hurting my nephew and niece shes going to die one day their door is always open shes entitled to have a conversation with me. I never respond though I would if she would do something other than try and manipulate me. Something I doubt she will ever be capable of. I can only imagine what kind of things they are all saying about me behind my back.Im building a much better life for myself without them.,raisedbynarcissists,dgx2qz7,12,t5_2we9n

11798561,0,t1_dgxejyk,Wasnt the intention to insinuate her future children matter more than she does but Id think especially with the invention of direct to consumer DNA tests it might be important to pass down that information even if its through her will etc. I advocate for open adoptee files for that reason people deserve to know where they came from. I acknowledge thats not always a popular answer though. ,raisedbynarcissists,dgxeoio,6,t5_2we9n

She doesnt want to feel alone and of course wants a day where all the attention will be on her.DH and I will make the trip together.
