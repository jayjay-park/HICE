7511500,0,t3_4i38ju,For people who think David thinks its bigfoot they are missing the point. From a presentation he didgtHunt for the Skinwalker bookPaulides mentions it in a talk he did at at MUFON .  He saidgtgtHonestly I think its one of the best books out there right now. I know both of these men. George is a really good friend. And Colm Kelleher actually helped write Bigfoot DNA Project. A lot of people dont know that he contributed in a big way.But whats important about this book in my view is that certain things that happened at that ranch mimic what happens in the bigfoot world. And I think that certain aspects of the aerial phenomena that occurred would hit a big cue with you and your knowledge as well he was referring to the audience.gtgtAnd the credibility of the people that were at the ranch documenting the incidents was impeccable. They hired a group of retired FBI agents to write up exactly what occurs. You talk about credible witnesses. Theres nothing more credible than them in my mind.If only one half of that book is factual to me it will change the paradigm of the average citizen. So if you get one thing out of me today dont buy my book. Go buy that book and read it. he was talking about Hunt for the SkinwalkerIts likely David thinks bigfoot may be related to what hes discovered but not the only thing. Like some of you post about it might be a more expansive phenomena that might include bigfoot. Or it might be nothing unusual. But saying David believes its bigfoot is an ignorant statement that the available evidence doesnt support. of course if you ask most of the people who say things like that if theyve had experiences they cant explain they say no but then when people like that do experience something they change their tune. If you dont know what Skinwalker ranch is the coauthor of the book spoke about it ,Missing411,d2w0qgs,1,t5_31d2x

8697841,0,t3_4gfb58,I just listened to Paulides  appearance on Coast to Coast AM. He dismisses paradoxical undressing and claims that even experienced Himalayan mountaineers have never seen the phenomenon paraphrasing.Paradoxical undressing is absolutely a real well documented phenomenon. Paulides claims to be objective and not wanting to speculatequalities of a good investigator. So why would a guy whos supposedly so well versed in SAR and wilderness missing persons cases choose to poopoo such a well grounded phenomenon?Later in the same interview he backpedals a bit saying that in a vast majority of cases clothes came off within the first hundred yards long before the victims should have been in endstage hypothermia. Alright good of him to qualify that. But it still doesnt excuse his willful ignorance and outright dismissial of paradoxical undressing earlier in the show. Even using a term like vast majority without quantifying it goes directly against the best practices of a professional investigator. Cops are often trained to give testimony using very carefully worded objective and precise phrasing so that their testimony is most useful. Vast majority is not a word choice Id expect from a professional investigator whos had a career of giving sworn testimony in court.Historians and detectives often tread a fine line between presenting plain dull facts versus coloring the narrative too strongly with opinion and disinformation. His flatout denial of paradoxical undressing as a known phenomenon goes against the very methodology that he claims to be following.,Missing411,d6sv15v,1,t5_31d2x

9317553,0,t3_570inc,That sounds so fucked. The thought of being alone in the outdoors and experiencing something like this terrifies me. When you sensed the presence and could tell it knew you knew it was there did you get a sense of what it could have been? Im only speculating here but I would think if we have this sixth sense of danger or when your being followedstared at we probably have a sense on what it is. Did it feel like a human presence? Or something entirely different? It obviously gave off an intelligent vibe if it could know.The sound you described all I can picture is something that can fly and swoop down behind you scraping its clawed fingers along the dirt trail before going back up again. Something that might like the idea of creating fear in you.Whatever it was Im sure it could have stopped playing its game at any point and made its move to incapacitate you.

He explains those criterion in his Coast to Coast AM interviews. The link above is to the biggest compilation of David Paulides interviews I could find. He does a very good job explaining and detailing cases and why he picks certain cases. Also if youre looking on Amazon.com and other sites to buy his books Paulides has indicated those are resellers trying to make a quick buck off people.

10339968,0,t1_dcf4bti,gtYou were posting promotional goods on a forum accusing the forum goers of a supernatural conspiracy. That is an incorrect accusation. Youre reading what you want into it.What is a supernatural conspiracy? lol Did you read where I said I am not implying this is a conspiracy?Where did I accuse them of a cover up?I posted a trailer to a documentary that is relevant to people in that role. If I was a park ranger or someone who visited parks frequently I would want to know about Missing . The Missing  documentary included interviews with two park rangers! Though one interview apparently did not make the cut but they plan to use it some other way. I dont know about the other one.The post was upvoted more than  times  you can confirm that yourself. The comments people made on the post were heated but that was because of the people making the comments. People do not like this topic and dont want to talk about it. Thats part of the problem. I knew it would be controversial posting there but it is also controversial if someone makes post in a Missing  subreddit challenging claims made by David Paulides and his books. Though I do it often and encourage other people to do it as long as they follow the subreddit rules. The difference is that I know that an open forum where there are rules is healthy and that discouraging any dissenting opinion is unhealthy. They have no rules. If you lived in a community where authorities could do what they want I dont think you would like it. That is called corruption and there are things in place to stop it for a reason.You are also free to make comments like this in this subreddit. Isnt it nice to know you can do that without fear of a moderator banning you on a whim because they disagree with you or have a different opinion? If I deleted a post you made and you asked me if and why it was deleted does that give me a right to ban you because I dont want to deal with you? Do you think that way of doing things would create a good place to discuss and share things?gtIt is completely fair that they deleted it and understandable that they banned youIt is fair they deleted it.It is not fair they did it for the reasons they did gave me no reason and banned me. I made one post not .  post relevant to a subreddit is not spam. gtgiven your over the top response to their response. They did not want to deal with you.I asked them if they deleted it and why. They banned me after that before I sent my second PM. What makes asking questions over the top? Good moderators would provide a reason for the ban when banning someone  there is an option to do that. Moderators are not there to ban whoever they want for any reason or because they dont like something or dont want to deal with someone. I cant ban you or someone else just because I dont like them or because I think you post promotional things. What is strange is that you are OK with that behavior. Attitudes like that result in situations where peoples rights are jeopardized and unethical behavior is enabled.,Missing411,dcg3ef7,2,t5_31d2x

This negates any human breeding plan because then the numbers would be reversed. It isnt a breeding program. I thought for a while the missing shoes meant they were after the bacteria in the shoes but why not cut the feet off too? They are grabbing fit men. And they are grabbing chicks that look like men. Did you even read the books? Slaves servants or fighting. Some are eaten yes. Like the kid who they only found his fing tooth. That poor fucker was eaten. When you only find the tooth thats because it was spit out or something the rest is in a shitpile somehwere in another dimension or something.
