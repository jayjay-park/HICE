1513061,0,t3_2bj681,I read all of it! Im just about to go to bed  now but I think I agreed with most of what you said. A few quick thoughts nowFirstly balance has not been a primary concern for a while because I hadnt finished adding stuff. As the game is more complete now Im going to try to focus on it a bit more. Generally I agree that all weapons should be balanced and that is my intention. I dont like where some dungeon crawlers have been going recently with some games automatically deciding if a new item is better amp equipping it without even asking the player! Just like the enemies I want the function of different items to be different not just straight up better. If theres a choice between a blasting vampiric mace and a regular hatchet you will have to take the mace or youre drastically underpowered. I dont play like that tbh Ill pick different weapons and stuff just for the hell of it. But agree that they should all be balanced. This kind of thing takes time and testing though we will get there eventually. Blasting should probably only do  extra damage now that everything else has been reduced. The hatchet is transformed by savage strikes if you attack with all  ap you can do    damage in one turn. Talent selection needs tweaking though. e.g. if you kill something with a thrown hatchet and level up you might get offered a sword or mace talent because your hands are empty. herpa derp derp. Displacement hatchet is pretty good but its also pretty rare amp its easy to make a mistake while using it and end up in the middle of a crowd. Vampiric did less damage in return to tolagal not sure why I didnt implement that the same here. Will probably change that in .. I think terror can be fixed by adding diminishing returns as suggested by rhazn. After a mob has been terrorised once they are then immune until combat ends or something. Polymorph is the best thing in the entire universe But would you mind telling us how the  extra damage is counted is it rounded or does the monsters health become a floating point value? Its just damage after reduction from shield  . its not rounded. Im going to change it to just  extra damage though dont like having fractions and I think people would get confused if I rounded it up or down. Battle axe. Im going to change bleed so the target bleeds for a fixed amount not  of the power attack damage. A bleed tick shouldnt do the same damage as a normal attack! Greatsword is kind of a leftover from a while back. I think a good idea could be to remove decapitate and replace it with the twohanded property you suggested. That seems like it would fit a greatsword  Well actually you suggested that as a talent but I think it fits better as a weapon property P Warhammer. Ill experiment removing ap penalty removing knockback and leaving the stun. It was OP before because it knocked back and stunned so even  ap enemies couldnt touch you. Vampiric warhammer OHHHH YEEEAAAAHH Shortbow. I think its fine really. Shield. Yeah the absorb amount needs tweaking  would probably be good. Maugoths shield. I can put  block on this after reducing the amount blocked by the normal shield. Then I can remove the ap penalty. I think its ok that it is just a flat increase because you have to earn it by killing the maugoth. Longbow. Its good it is just a shortbow with knockback. This seems a bit like a flat increase but idk. Sometimes you dont want to knock the enemies away. Ill probably leave it as it is. Its not so much better than a shortbow that you would swap to it without thinking esp. if you had a magic shortbow.On to the new properties and weaponsIm happy that you have lots of ideas! I kinda want to add as many different things as possible although balancing too many might be a nightmare! I like weakening. Sharp Im not so sure about anymore. It might end up letting you kill lots of enemies in  turn that you otherwise wouldnt be able to. If you kill them in  turn the increased AP is of no consequence. I would rename rusty to poisoned or something would apply a little DoT when you power attack. Like a weaker version of bleed. Hhm this could give the enemies a buff as well as doing damage over time like sharp would have.Javelin Normal attack damage  thrown attack damage . Piercing Ignores enemy shields and parries. FUCK YEAH! Could have a varient that doesnt ignore shields but can damage multiple enemies if they are in a line! Some of these could also have the two handed property.Smart footed You get knocked back by any melee attack. Interesting not sure. Maybe if it also reduced damage taken by a little bit?Look at dem moves You get pulled towards any ranged attack if there is room. I would rename this to combat roll or something. But Im still not sure there will be times when the player doesnt want to get pulled and feel like control of the character is being taken away from them. This makes people rage. Trust me I used to mind control people in to lava at blackrock spire in vanilla WoW. They dont like it DSneaky ninja man You can get closer to enemies before they detect you than you otherwise could. I was planning on adding this as a property that can appear on rings. Too cliche?Hopefully this makes sense. Im very tired! Going to bed now ,tolagal,cj5xsyu,2,t5_32ovf
2096007,0,t3_2irt6b,Planetfall noticed a bug in my last stream video At the  minute mark I had my greatsword charged but I dropped it to make more damage with the steel bow. A ushatar came amp attacked me amp I parried the attack.  With my fists...  Yeah.,tolagal,cl68yv7,2,t5_32ovf
2134558,0,t1_clb4h46,I guess it just takes time to update because now theyve suddenly appeared.Edit Not everywhere but more places. This is just weird.,tolagal,clb5dp9,1,t5_32ovf
