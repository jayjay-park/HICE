8721431,0,t3_4zhe3s,The Narendra Jadhav interview Caste system is the most brilliantly administered scam in history At a time when the country has just witnessed a big Dalit uprising in the Bharatiya Janata Party ruled state of Gujarat against atrocities the conversation is rife about the ways in which the country can end castebased discrimination. The recent Dalit rally in Una announced that Dalits of the state will stand together against atrocities and wont do the job of cleaning up carcasses. But the conflict is not going to go away any time soon and as more Dalits realise the extent of atrocities they are going to rise up and question the unchecked power and privilege of the upper caste communities. Are Dalits forever going to be appropriated for the tasks that are considered menial?It is very strange and surprising that so called highborn are asking or punishing Dalits for not doing their jobs. To brand him as a Dalit and a leader of Dalits we have done a grave injustice to him.,WeAreIndia,d6vtior,1,t5_3fko4
