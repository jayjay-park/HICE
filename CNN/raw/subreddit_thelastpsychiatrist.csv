Despite the fact that a strong sense of self does not rely on others opinions in the first place.Social media can be seen as one big attempt to affirm the self or ego through others selves perception of ones self. It is not you that you are in love with but an image of you.  Narcissus  The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relations relating itself to itself in the relation the self is not the relation but is the relations relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite of the temporal and the eternal of freedom and necessity in short a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way a human being is still not a self.... In the relation between two the relation is the third as a negative unity and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If however the relation relates itself to itself this relation is the positive third and this is the self.  Kierkegaard What a mindjob  Cypher The Matrix,thelastpsychiatrist,cyhkgx8,1,t5_2zd20

Unfortunately people leaving randomly in the middle of a conversation reflects a great deal of narcissism  which is why I no longer value the concept except in its extreme application to personality disorders.My thought is that avoidant personalities and anxious personalities both see eachothers behavior as selfish and thus narcissistic  which explains why the definition of narcissism is made incoherent by opposing criteria.  Your final point is extremely good for anyone who is not a therapist.   The ability to tolerate guilt is essential.

11801214,0,t3_68dufh,Its nice seeing him approach the matter in a procedural fashion. My mother has a personality disorder and you can see the telltale sign which is that a permanent selfdefending experience of reality is not stressful and not deployed in times of crisis but the defense instead long ago became a permanent filter of her reality which distorts anything that enters into her experience.I post this with some curiosity because I often wonder if a personality disorder is adjacent to autism because a my mother is autistic and so by my reckoning is Dolezal and b it seems related to OCD in its conversion of sense phenomena which are normally bounded to a social experience of meaningdepth being utterly socialmeaningdeprived and then replaced with this odd quality of being something to lawyer or something to insert in an argument. In order to avoid any confusion I feel its important to highlight here that I think autistic people are awesome and do NOT lack care for other people.What do I mean by this? You can often see in autistic people a greater relationship with technical reality but in personality disordered people this experience becomes in some sense the sole reality. Objects of experience seem filtered through a harder linguistic framework converted into the stuff of dreams without a social imagining leaving behind only the argument of an experience but I cant tell what that argument is. Is it an attempt to experience symmetry a pure satiation of the OCD operating system to which all her energy floods because she lacks empathy? Is a personality disorder actually a hard kernel of semantic pragmatism robbed of... Im not sure what? Robbed of the ability to add the presence of an Other to it because the Other is a threat?,thelastpsychiatrist,dgxpin0,3,t5_2zd20
