Your experiences are not things I can necessarily relate to but I can relate to feeling very worried anxious and exhausted and it certainly sounds like you have every reason to feel that way because your worries are very valid.It also sounds like you have tons of emotions going on right now naturally so! Pregnancy hormones amp so many challenges on top of that including being sleep deprived! but I feel like if youre able to think logically youd notice that just because tons of awful things have happened doesnt mean theyre a predictor for future bad things! It also sounds like you feel super out of control and at the mercy of the world and while you cant control whether your baby will have Autism or not you absolutely can control how you react to it and how you feel about  it. You also have control to get some support if you need it to help you through all your emotions whether thats counselling turning to family and friends or speaking to your doctor.  I sincerely hope things start looking up for you and everything gets solved with your dog and everything goes well with your pregnancy and you have a wonderful baby who regardless of health status you will love just as much as your yearold! ,Septemberbumpers2017,dd7gjre,8,t5_3i8tw

It helped both times though. I am trying to avoid medicine as much as possible right now even though I know a rescue inhaler is safe. I am pretty sure the main reason I was diagnosed in the first place was because I moved from a really damp cool musty place Cambridge England to basically next to the sun Okinawa.

Since getting pregnant I will get the same intense cramping and urge to go but cant. Last night I was so constipated I almost threw up. Nightly Colace isnt doing it and I am adding miralax to see if that can loosen things up.The annoying thing is that I am eating more fruits and veggies now than before I got pregnant. Even when I eat foods know to trigger me nothing. If this latest round of Miralax does not work I am calling my OB. I dont want to swing to wide the other way but at this point Id take that over this. ,Septemberbumpers2017,ddoswpu,5,t5_3i8tw

10943224,0,t3_5w9us3,We had to tell some friends earlier than I wanted. We were going out to dinner with another couple and the guys brother and they were insisting on sushi. Normally Id be able to just order something not raw and be able to hide it pretty well but they wanted to go to this certain sushi place where you sit down and the chef just makes you whatever he wants and passes out unlimited sake and then you just get a bill with a total dollar amount at the end. Amazing sushi but totally not something I could do. Anyways the girlfriend of our friend starts bawling her eyes out at the news because she is so happy for us. It was a little strange since we have known her and theyve only been dating for  months but whatever. Then she starts asking and begging to plan the baby shower for me. Now Ive already thought about this topic... We live on the other side of the country from both our families so we will be going home in May or June and my sister will plan a shower for me with home friends and family then. But out here I really dont have that many friends who are girls. Most of our friends are single guys. So the idea of a baby shower with them is pretty comical and I just figured that a baby shower out here wouldnt happen. So I tried explaining this to the girl in between her bawling sobs her screeches of excitement and her insisting that she has the best baby shower ideas but I dont think I got through to her since shes now planning my baby shower. Oh well... luckily I wont have to stress about it and if it happens it happens and if not it wont bother me. But man this girl was acting nutty. She also demanded to be the godmother. I dont know how seriousdrunk she was but my response was there will be no godparents. Insert biggest eye roll ever. Haha,Septemberbumpers2017,de8pspx,6,t5_3i8tw

11210196,0,t3_5zyg94,My parents are divorced and theres a big disparity in income between them so while not quite as extreme as what youre describing we always got bigger more expensive gifts from my dad. And bigger more expensive vacations. I loved presents as much as the next kid but it didnt matter. I didnt resent my mom or think my dad was bettercooler because he spent more. The expensive video games were cool but my mom got thoughtful gifts that I really appreciated.I think you can tactfully bring it up if you frame it as not having a lot of storage space for stuff and suggest fewer toys and nonmaterial gifts. But if they brush it off and really want to buy a lot of stuff you dont have to keep it all. You can go through the pile with your child and pick out things to donate to foster kids or other charities afterward. If theyre dumping  gifts on him he wont miss a few and will probably feel good about passing them on to needy kids. ,Septemberbumpers2017,df2nvk7,1,t5_3i8tw

11352247,0,t3_61t2al,. Not fight about finances in front of the kids. At a very young age I had to deal with stress of debts without having any way to help and I felt bad about it all the time. Compared friends families to mine and felt bad. Just knew we were poor but not HOW poor so I just assumed the worst. Even when I got older and my mom would try to buy me clothes Id purposely not pick what I wanted because it was a few dollars more expensive. . Verbal abuse of spouse in front of children. There came a point when I started actually disliking my own father based on what my mom said not in the actual relationship I had with him. It really messed things up for a long time. . No overthetop explosive outbursts. From my mom I unfortunately inherited that horrible quality when I get mad its a big tantrum instead of a normal disappointment reaction while living at home. Everything was an over reaction. Mildly annoyed turns into a huge deal for no reason. Monkey seen monkey do. Its been  better now that Ive been away from home and lived with my husband for  years. Still working on it still sucks. . Actually have an allowance for chores but not excessive. We literally had no incentive to do chores except for the fact wed be verbally abused if we didnt. We did stuff out of fear of retaliation from my mom. Turned out to be a straight arrow kid because I was scared of my mom retaliating if I did something bad. I want my kids to learn how to save money with money that is EARNED and not just from gift money. Its really important to me to instill this at a young age. . Consistent meal times together. Its funny because I rarely remember eating dinner together outside of Sunday dinners. I feel like I want to have consistent family dinner and make it a rare thing NOT to eat together. . Cleanliness. My parents left their crap out ALL the time but would ream us if we didnt have our crap put away. Even made us put their stuff away a lot too and be pissed if we put it back in the wrong spot and lost it like sorry I dont know where all this crap goes. Definitely a double standard and wasnt fair. If I expect my kids to do something I need to be doing it too. . Doing things out of fear of retaliation is not normal. I want my children to do things out of respect and to meet their goals. I want them to make choices with the healthy reason of not liking the consequence of something isnt done instead of fearing the person telling you to do it. In school I thought my teachers would react like my mom if I forgot to do homework and such so I was a pretty good student because I feared retaliation. This behavior also led to being a bit lazy when I left home because hey nobody would ream me if I didnt wash my dishes right away! Because I didnt care things didnt get done until I learned more importantly to base things I did off the consequence good or bad that naturally followed whatever decision I made. . Its important that my children learn the value of hard work. I was always so mad at my brother because he started as a bad student in school and my parents would always bail him out and do his school work FOR HIM. Like obviously he doesnt have an incentive to work for school if someone else literally will do it for him! I want my children to get out of life what they put into it. If that means learning the lesson the hard way good because learning failure at a young age is much easier to deal with than learning it later. I want my children to learn that working hard gets results not everyone is a winner and to deal with it. . Consistent punishment. Sometimes my parents would be like oh dont do that again and other times sometimes the SAME thing happened it was a huge punishment like grounded for  days. Like what? it was never consistent. Sometimes even no punishment happened at all which was even more confusing when something similar happened and the punishment seemed severe. Sometimes one of my siblings would always get severe while I got an easy ride. And then vice versa. Id be shocked sometimes at the choice of punishment and usually it didnt seem fair or fit for the crime. I learned that a lot of the time it was based on my parents MOOD for that day. Ugh. . Appropriate boundaries. She was pretty invasive about my life details and friends and such when I lived at home. Now My mother has NO concept that Ive been married for  years yet she demands to know things like Im a child living at home. She has unreasonable expectations all the time. Gets mad that we dont go out to see her and my dad more often and is verbally abusive like you dont love us because we cant go out of state to see hem a lot. Like freaking A Im an adult with an adult life and adult responsibilities. I cant just drop everything to appease your wishes. Its ridiculous. Even when Dh and I make choices together and my mom doesnt agree she will flip out and be verbally abusive like she has any choice or say in what we choose to do. Its so ridiculous. I will NOT be doing that to my children inside the home or out! . Lastly being real about things. If my parents were fighting we werent allowed to tell anyone about it. My mom threatened me multiple times about serious family matters that I couldnt talk about. I began internalizing a lot of things. Something big happened while I was in high school and since I couldnt talk to anyone I retreated from friends and was closed off because I didnt know how to deal with it. My parents wouldnt even talk to us about things. I never saw my parents communicate to work things out. This has led to a lot of unhealthy relationships with people because I didnt know how to deal with bad things. I learned when something bad happens its swept under the rug immediately and not dealt with. Horrible. Ive had emotional problems from this now and cant express or get through emotional things like a normal person because I was never taught how. Part two of being real about things my parents cared more about the appearance of our family rather than being real about our life. We had to put on a smile for the world. My mom puts value on bragging about her kids but when we are going through a tough time she would lie and say things were perfect. I still have issues with this because even with my own husband I act like theres not a problem when there actually is so I bury it and feel resentment until my husband can finally get it out of me. Its so so unhealthy but my parents taught it to me. Thanks mom. ,Septemberbumpers2017,dfir8ek,1,t5_3i8tw

The ideal is to space children by at least two years and some methods are incompatible with breastfeeding or just hard to manage when your time is stretched thin. Im planning on getting a hormonal IUD inserted as soon after birth as I can. Like if they can do it right after delivery that would be amazing.

But we really couldnt tell from the pictures even with an arrow pointing at it. Yesterday at  my doctor did his scan and asked if we wanted to know and I told him it was a boy.
