5727081,0,t1_cx5zdaq,cheaper for who? not only are the numbers used debatable but that claimed reduction in price has not transferred.to the consumer. most g.m.crops grown in the u.s. go to feed animals we then eat. has the price of meat dropped or has the price of all grocery foods increased at the same rate as they have for years?growing faster does not necessarily make it cheaper as with the salmon it takes the very same nutrient input to grow a salmon to size to get above average corn yields some farmers boost their inputs which cost extra..also keep in mind that the biggest increases in yields over the last  years have all been from conventional methods such as notill farming and improvements to livestock health,VentureBiotech,cx700tw,0,t5_2w3no
