5244281,0,t1_cvi3r70,Yeah if you store data in a proprietary file format then you need that proprietary software to be able to easily read that data. This has always been true with or without subscriptions. In Lightroom when your subscription is inactive it actually is a bit more forgiving than Photoshop. You can still look through your catalog but the develop module is deactivated.Listen I know how it is. During my younger days I was just as principled. I would even run Linux on the desktop and such because open source. Now I pay for the full Creative Suite. On my computers and even my phone and tablet I have access to the full legal versions of every Adobe app fully updated. No piracy no limits. I have access to the most powerful digital media creation tools there are. No more Paint.net or GIMP. I have the real deal Photoshop.

6408436,0,t3_43f9i9,If you want to stretch the budget a little bit the  is very versatile and will do what you want with portraits and and landscapes. Its a great multipurpose lens with nice picture quality. It would be my pick. Its far larger than your other choices though so keep that in mind if it matters.The  is a little too tight for general street photography. Image quality is very nice though and the lens is small and light. The mm Oly is one of my favorites but you have to try it out yourself for street photography. The focal length is tighter than what I like if Im going to take only one lens out.I recently picked up a Panasonic mm . and thats a lens that I would not mind leaving the house with as the only lens. Versatile all around but not great for portraits. Also kinda pricey if new. However the pictures are very nice and the focal length lends itself well to the street.

I never had any issues with EMi nor with my current body so I guess it goes to show maybe my own shooting environment hasnt been as ruggedopen as that of someone like ugenerationfourth below. Maybe this means it doesnt matter for me?

Obviously there are other differences between the two bodies like size handling IBIS etc. but I wanted to talk about just one particular facet of the m camera bodies that seems to get highlighted in some discussions.

8082991,0,t3_4pxdm0,It depends on how youd want to use it in video.If its for indoor events in really tight spaces of people probably not a useful focal length. If its for close ups of objects added interest or if you want to get close ups without getting in peoples faces it might be useful but youd want it on a second camera or only use it for specific shots. Wider focal lengths are more useful for most things dealing with people unless you have a lot of room. If you want to add an artistic quality to your videos its a great focal length for that!If I was a pro and did events Id take a second camera with my .mm lens as a way to get supplementary shots to break scenes up.Sounds like you already have the ability to test that focal length though?For what its worth my favourite focal length for video is mm on M because I can capture those added interest shots by just moving closer to the subject but not getting tooooo much in peoples faces.That being said I have the . f. and it is a great lens and a great focal length!

8847015,0,t1_d7a6taw,gt Wider lenses. You have to take into account the crop factor here which for Nikon is .x and for m is x. This means that a mm lens is equivalent to mm on Nikon and mm on m. This affects your Rule of  calculations too  your exposure time on m would only be  secs vs.  on Nikon.Sure but you wouldnt apply equivalencies like that if you wanted a mm FF equivalent lens then you would have to pick a mm lens for Nikon and a mm for M. So then you would have  seconds of exposure time in every case.gt Larger apertures in the absolute sense not in fstops. This should be considered in conjunction with the above. The wide lenses that would give you a good field of view do not have relatively fast apertures e.g. mm f.. However the actual size of the aperture is quite small mm.  .mm. An equivalent on Nikon would be a mm . same field of view same relative aperture but the actual size of the aperture is mm.  .mm allowing you to gather much more light for the same field of view.

10167748,0,t3_5lll2z,That looks exactly like the Panasonic Leica mm even cost the same. Are we sure its not the same lens just debranded for DJI?,M43,dbwkjao,6,t5_2ts0d
10200113,0,t3_5m29ty,After a little more research it does seem that the lens will be  which at first I thought was too good to be true I guess making them variable aperture they were able to keep the size and cost down. Very excited for this lens will also be interesting to see at which FL the aperture changes. Lots of exciting stuff coming in the next few months. ,M43,dc08n3t,1,t5_2ts0d
10234599,0,t1_dc41lce,gt Any lens will distort a face when the face is too close....and perhaps also importantly a longer lens will flatten features more which people seem to find pleasing in general for portraits. I find the mm f. narrow enough for portraits but I do prefer the look of mm f..,M43,dc45dco,5,t5_2ts0d
10259340,0,t3_5mvzxz,There might be a jump like there was with Sony rxmk gt mk if backside illumination or whatever else thats missing now is introduced.  Whether the expectations will evolve for something like that to still be deemed satisfactory is the question.  It appears that Sony will start updating the a line and we may still see an a from them in apsc.  If those set the expectations people will still be complaining.  ,M43,dc6yark,4,t5_2ts0d
10260602,0,t1_dc714mr,This is incorrect. The sensor is super mm size at .k resolution. So its a much lower resolution and around an APSC sized sensor. It just has an M mount option.Having said that consider that were talking about a larger sensor with a much lower resolution and that sensor is only getting about . more stops of dynamic range than the  years old GH which is rated at about . stops in mp stills. Dynamic range is simply not an issue any more for most modern digital cameras.,M43,dc73fq3,1,t5_2ts0d

10854848,0,t1_ddzcm67,I for one would be happier with it if it was f or even f. but had no vignetting and more even sharpness the f seems like a gimmick at this point. Youre not gonna snap photos of moving things indoors anyways with a manual lens and for stationary you can just use a long exposure.,M43,ddzlmwd,1,t5_2ts0d

11007465,0,t1_defkpxs,Thanks for the feedback! I didnt think about that particular aspect of framing but something that does throw me off in this photo is it feels like the middle pancake is popping out in a weird way relative to where the rest of the focus is.

11325499,0,t1_dffnvpk,Renting the a and the ARII was a super interesting experience and its definitely not one that proved M to be behind.The only thing that the ARII left me wanting in M was low light I was able to get decent not great  shots at  ISO in almost no light in a bar.  I can only image what the AS can do.Everything else pretty much pushed me towards staying with M.  The IBIS on Olympus and Panasonic seem quite a bit better.  The file size of the ARII was way more than I needed.  And probably most importantly the ergonomics on the EM mk II are way better than the  ARII and the a is just not even in the running though the grip is nice.Heres some footage of the IBIS in the EM mk II when shooting video,M43,dffq60a,3,t5_2ts0d

11574734,0,t1_dg7zxzn,I really love the framing in the shot but theres just something a little off. I cant decide what it is I think its the noise in the haze above the spires. Really dig the color that came through though.,M43,dg80377,2,t5_2ts0d

11714785,0,t1_dgggy3e,You are better off getting the excellent and smallPanasonic  instead.   is not really far enough for animals . its intended for people who want an allinone lens. ,M43,dgnweuw,1,t5_2ts0d
11741060,0,t1_dgpuegl,I think night portrait at least the Panasonic one is some sort of light composition thing where it stacks multiple shots. You could theoretically do this by shooting multiple underexposed shots and stacking them in post later. Results will suffer from inevitable camera shake.From now on I will answer like youre new to photography. If you arent do ignore the followingIf youre looking for single shot without post processing kind of deal there are fairly few things you can do. Firstly your photos probably fail either because you underexpose resulting in too dark images you shoot with too slow shutter speed for handheld resulting in blur or your sensor sensitivity is too high resulting in noise. I will concentrate on the shutter speed here since its the most likely culprit. You can get a fast lens if you dont have one. For example f. or f. are about  stops faster than f. of kit lenses at their wide ends. This means four times higher shutter speeds for same exposure so going from  seconds to  seconds for example. You could also reduce shutter speed by increasing ISO. This increases noise but unless youre printing a large image it might be very bearable. Cameras tend to limit auto ISO to  or  by default. For my GX this was . At least to me on my camera ISO  is still bearable and I could go slightly higher if I really had to. You could also just deal with the longer shutter speeds. A tripod will let you shoot whatever at night since you can let the camera expose for as long as it allows exposing for. Image stabilization and good shooting technique can also do wonders. My GX  mm f. let me shoot about  second exposures relatively reliably if I really concentrate on it. Thats still not enough in a truly dark place though. These arent generally a great solution if youre trying to capture anything that moves though.Finally you could just get a proper flash if the situation allows proper use of one. This has some learning curve though even if the situation allows it but ultimately if it is dark enough the best way to get good shots is to add light.,M43,dgqvnlt,1,t5_2ts0d
