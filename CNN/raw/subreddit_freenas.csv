If you want to expand the size of the drives you use in your expansion doesnt really matter since they will be a separate vdev from whatever your pool is initially made of.  That is to say if you start with a xTB mirrored setup and want to add two more drives later you can add xTB mirrored drives as a new vdev and add that vdev to your pool.  ZFS doesnt provide any way to expand the original xTB vdev into something like a single xTB vdev.  The bigger thing to think about is parity.

3045776,0,t1_codotxa,Well you are planning on building a RAIDZ array.  That has parity which is a form of redundancy.Im merely saying that your backup copy should also have some redundancy so that when your primary fails there is less of a chance of your backup failing before it can be restored to the primary.I would say that in order of importance it should go like this.Keep a primary copy of your data this goes without saying.  Next add a backup copy of your data.  Next add redundancy mirroring parity etc to your primary copy.  Next add redundancy to your backup copy.  I would rather have a backup of my primary before I worried about building redundancy into my primary.  Redundancy only protects against things like disk failure and maybe file modifications if you use snapshots like on ZFS.  Backup protects against a LOT more failure possibilities.And if you say that you want redundancy because you need to guarantee uptime for that data then you definitely need a backup because losing that data is going to be a LOT more downtime than the time it would take to restore it from backup.,freenas,codozpw,2,t5_2ruud

There are other comments in this thread that I need to respond to but they slipped through the cracks.gt Small point of order I can and do add drives to vdevs every day when I replace drives due for resilvering. My original post was poorly worded. I should have gone into greater detail about when you can add drives to a vdev. Perhaps its just semantics but I dont consider replacing a drive to be adding.gt But it goes to parity not data for instance add a drive to a mirror vdev and it becomes a mirror vdev.Ive not heard the terminology mirror and mirror before. Am I right to assume youre referring to a mirror vdev with  and  mirrored drives?gt What you were trying to say I think is you cannot increase the size of a vdev by adding drives which is true.Again I blame my poor choice of wordslack of elaboration. I was referring to RAIDz vdevs. Its one of those cases of not saying something because you think it goes without saying but it only results in a lack of clarity. Given the OPs situation I just assumed that some form of RAIDz so that why the scope of my comment was narrow.gt Well if you added a TB drive to a TB mirror vdev then once resilvering is done added another TB drive and remove both TB you would end up with a TB vdev automagically...The same is true of RAIDz arrays. You can replace drives one by one but then you have to grow the vdev in order to utilise all of the space.,freenas,ct5mfj0,1,t5_2ruud

So the motherboard should be a SuperMicro and pay close attention to the model you purchase.Heres some advice on X vs X seriesThe XSLF is still a fantastic board but you cant go past GB on that. The X series is newer so you get DDR support up to GB and some other newer features. But as you can read in the above link there will be some potential compatibility issues. Im sure those can be overcome but it may not be a straight ride.Personally if you go SuperMicro I recommend staying away from the SAE series with onboard sound. My experience with those was just bad X SAE and their odd consumerserver feature mix is not what I want in a server.CPU then would be a Xeon E no matter what. Look at the  lineup that is compatible with whatever board you choose. In other words Id let the motherboard decision drive the CPU choice and just lock in  cores with HT and decent clock speed itll run all your stuff and be bored.When you have made a selection no harm in also posting on the freenas forums for doublechecking.

8209277,0,t1_d53o7zc,OpenMediaVault is the NAS OS but you can use numerous type of file systems even ZFS if you want. You can do mirroring too. snapRaid plugin can provide parity redundancy in the case of a drive failure. It also lets you add disk incrementally one by one to expand storage. Data is stored on each drive like normal you can even take it out and read it like an external HD elsewhere. If that drive dies and parity fails too then only data on the drive is lost all other drives is fine. When data is written only one drive is needed to turn on the other drives stays idle. Unlikes ZFS where all the drives needs to be on. Rebuilding will require all drives to be read including parity. Dual parity will allow for  drives to fail. You can actually have more parity beyond .snapraid is very similar to unraid or flexraid but is able to run in OMV as a plugin. You can even run snapraid on a windows machine.,freenas,d53pqfo,1,t5_2ruud
