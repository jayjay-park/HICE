I will try other avenues as well like Facebook Twitter and whatnot thanks The Oklahoma sub hasnt had a post in over a year and a half so was just taking my chances in the main.

In my opinion that is since I dont really play MOBAs yet i understand the basics.I agree in the sense of SC being more interesting to watch tho.If there was to be an esport event in a bar near you  what game would you like to see?,BarCraft,cwfuzl0,1,t5_2sjsf
