11361755,0,t1_dfjktj2,Yup try throwing a spear at it! You can get past it by wriggling free but Ive found it pretty unreliable. ,rainworld,dfju0tr,2,t5_30dfd

11402460,0,t3_6275fg,A few movement tipsSlide  Can only be done standing. While moving left or right press down crouch and jump to slide along the ground. Does not work on hilly  uneven surfaces. Slightly faster than moving.Tunnel Jump  Fairly easy movement trick. Jump while moving left  right in a pipe to boost forward. Can also jump while moving downwards to drop and upwards for a slight leap. Fair warning Slugcat will not grab onto the tunnel walls when jumping upward. Also jumping while backwards in a pipe reorients Slugcat. Tunneling in the direction you are facing is both faster and allows throwing while backpedaling.WallClimb  WallJump  Difficult. Hold up Might or might not be necessary and move towards the wall while jumping. Slugcat will kick off the wall and bounce backwards. Immediately move towards the wall behind Slugcat and press jump. Repeat until you reach the roof. Useful for getting the berries in the Factory  Industrial area.Saving Roll  When falling heights that would knock out Slugcat typically . to .ish the screens height pressing down and moving forward right before the point of impact causes Slugcat to perform a save keeping him conscious  unstunned. Useful if being chased. Semidifficult.,rainworld,dfogdjb,3,t5_30dfd
11403381,0,t3_62q3xh,Id only use your boost with A when youre in danger. Otherwise never tap A while under water because like you guessed you run out of oxygen considerably faster. When youre on the surface of the water you can do a dive by pressing A then once under water just use the stickdpad to move around and dont boost.,rainworld,dfok4q9,8,t5_30dfd

11462788,0,t1_dfv5ckm,Has anyone attempted to mess with a wounded vulture like if it has a spear or something on it to take it off to see if it does not attack? Or making them friendly?  Because if its a no this is the time I will attack that bastard and kill it while is down for always interrupting me for dinner.,rainworld,dfvat1e,1,t5_30dfd
11473589,0,t3_63qyzo,You can kill the weeds with  spears. Large centipedes can also eat them.More reliably you can stun them with a thrown item use the scrap found lying around and run past them while theyre thrashing.Not sure which area youre referring to maybe post a screenshot if youre still having trouble.,rainworld,dfwiyoh,1,t5_30dfd
11503841,0,t3_63wt4i,Dont drop the pearl or throw it at them throw it to them press the button whilst facing a nearby Scavenger and they should catch it automatically.,rainworld,dfzylgr,2,t5_30dfd

11544286,0,t1_dfwcc0o,Nope! I ran into some in Subterranean and as long as you swimcrawl pass slowly you can stand right in front of them and theyll not react. Either that or you can throw a spear at them to stun then and book it past before they recover. I dont think you can kill them this way though...,rainworld,dg4jor0,1,t5_30dfd
11551523,0,t3_64vecp,oh also there are lil centipedes in that little cave just before the exterior gates  they give two food slots for each you eat and there are usually a couple hanging around there,rainworld,dg5d9t6,3,t5_30dfd
11561432,0,t3_64xxow,And this behaviour little slugcats is the reason why there are no Red Slugcats in Rain World anymore.,rainworld,dg6hr5j,3,t5_30dfd
11608123,0,t1_dgbr2pv,Yeah what Im doing is finding those values like .f and such in DNSpy and editing the IL Instructions to change them.Of course I only ever succeeded in changing slugcats gravity and that made his head not connect to his body and he kinda couldnt move at all.. but thats what Ive been doing.Cant wait for that tutorial though!,rainworld,dgbsh6q,1,t5_30dfd

11622287,0,t3_65sjx1,I came here to see if this was just me or if it was meant to be that way. Tried two times in a row same shit. Gonna try a third time but its always about in the same spot not sure what to do to avoid it...EDIT Third attempt worked this time I wasnt smashed around. I tried not to touch any wall if I could but I guess its not really a way to avoid it. Its probably just luck.,rainworld,dgdeb7c,1,t5_30dfd

11666736,0,t1_dgidtwi,I posted a thread on this reddit containing all the translated texts in the game there was nothing in there indicating any secret pearls or conversations that mightve been missed.In the code itself there is the Void sea containing  phases after which you are shown the endingoutro. I could only find one outro in the image files. The soul tree or whatever you want to call itI think this is kind of like Shadow of the Colossus and other mysterious adventure games where it feels like there should be something bigger in the world. Where people do the craziest things to find some supposedly hidden place  some big secret to be unveiled. But there are none. ,rainworld,dgifuc4,4,t5_30dfd
