594322,0,t3_20xke7,     Campsites are first come first serve. It shouldnt be to crazy busy this weekend but it is season so definitely expect a lot of people to be here. I would suggest getting here Thursday or early Friday to get a good camp site. The most popular campsite is Hidden Valley but Jumbo Rocks Ryan campground and Indian Cove are also some popular spots.      The weather is perfect right now so you are choosing a good time to come out and enjoy the desert  As for water Barker Dam may have some water at the moment. It wont be much though but its a beautiful spot to check out. Morongo Preserve in Morongo Valley aways has water in the creek and is an awesome spot to go hike at! There is also a little creek at  Palms Oasis.      Enjoy your stay in the desert! Forgot to add something! Saturday mornings are when the Joshua Tree farmers market is held. Its held in a parking lot in front of some really great local shops Natural Sisters Cafe Jennys herb shoppe the Joshua Tree Health Foods Store etc. on the corner of Sunset and  Palms Hwy. Its a great way to get to experience Joshua Tree and meet some locals! There is a couple of art galleries right there and also Tedd Quinns Listening Lounge. Its a great way to start a great weekend and get some fuel for a hike! ,JoshuaTree,cg7ttyx,5,t5_2taeo

3046961,0,t3_2v1gf9,What trail are you taking? Not usually any water though sometimes at barker dam. Its pretty nasty and stagnant though. What you should do is cache water where the trails cross roads. I took the whole california riding and hiking trail  thanksgivings ago and cached twice for  days and I was fine. ,JoshuaTree,codteuu,3,t5_2taeo

3318049,0,t1_cp6cdh0,Going off of this also dont leave any food in the open. Put it in a bin with a lid and keep it in your car. Last time I was there some small rodents ate through snack bags and a loaf of bread because I stupidly kept my food in a container without a lid overnight on the picnic table.,JoshuaTree,cp6hi48,4,t5_2taeo
3635601,0,t1_cq6omf6,I should note though if you are able to snag a first come first served site in one of the other campgrounds for Saturday you would be able to keep it for the remainder of the weekend if you so choose. Call and cancel your Indian Cove reservation too so the ranger staff can release those sites to other visitors hoping to find a site.,JoshuaTree,cq6oph1,2,t5_2taeo
3643386,0,t1_cq29z0j,ahh ok yeah thats exactly what it is its tucked away not far from the parking area.  it definitely can be hard to miss if you dont know what youre looking for. it does take a tiny bit of scrambling up and down a couple boulders to get there,JoshuaTree,cq7kn1i,2,t5_2taeo
5236014,0,t1_cvh33al,I looked all over the internet for any information regarding SAR being deployed and came up with nothing. It seems to me someone was searching for something else. They kept shining the spotlight within dozens of yards of us and looked like they were trying to catch somebody in the act of doing something illegal i.e. fire weapons etc.,JoshuaTree,cvh4oqf,0,t5_2taeo

6916164,0,t3_4agugh,The Keys West backcountry board at the southern end of the Boyscout Trail will be closer to all the places you list.  Its pretty centrally located for the main attractions in the park.  Indian Cove is closer to town and more isolated from the rest of the park.  ,JoshuaTree,d109qgk,4,t5_2taeo
7166927,0,t1_d1soqi3,thanks for advertising this and your instagram account. joshua tree is all about selfpromotion and commerce so its a perfect fit here.,JoshuaTree,d1st87u,0,t5_2taeo
7540062,0,t1_d2z99p9,One time I was cooking steak on my burner after sunset and we had a swarm of coyotes start circling us at a radius of about  ft. I was drinking and so I wasnt paying attention until they had started to get real close. I flashed my light at them and one retreated. Then I started to yell and shine my light at them all and they started to yip. Then I took a step closer and yelled at them. They all ran off immediately once they deemed me a threat. This was in the backcountry near Geology Tour Rd by Ryan Mt. At the campsites theyre more likely to steal from your picnic table if you arent paying attention. Just carry a knife on you and you should be fine if youre scared easily. I have a machete on me in the backcountry,JoshuaTree,d2z9oeq,2,t5_2taeo
8811127,0,t1_d76xgya,If you want to get somewhere a little more remote might I recommend the Mojave National Preserve? There are a lot fewer people who visit there let alone people driving at night especially with dirt roads. Depending on how far you want to drive there are many options and I think even better Joshua Tree forests there.,JoshuaTree,d76z7k2,2,t5_2taeo
10031988,0,t1_dbf5imr,Probably start at Hidden Valley and work your way east.  If you see a site where people look like theyre starting to pack up to leave ask if you can just park there until theyre done then the site is yours.  No guarantees next week however.,JoshuaTree,dbf70ug,2,t5_2taeo

10599402,0,t1_dd97ooy,I just took a quick look on Google satellite The Intersection Rock parking area for example has the center RV spots. You can easily plan options for parking lots and alternatives using Maps. Have fun and good luck!,JoshuaTree,dd98wgu,2,t5_2taeo

11380701,0,t3_62cs5u,Depends on the day you get there. If you arrive Friday or Saturday there its unlikely. Might be early enough on Friday for there still to be a spot or two open but wouldnt count on it. Anymore Im finding Jumbo Rocks is filling up by Thursday afternoonevening in the spring. ,JoshuaTree,dflzeqa,1,t5_2taeo

11785806,0,t1_dgvrq4n,It was a Saturday. There were  other cars in total all headed away from the mountains.The road itself is  miles long. It starts or at least this video starts at the turn off from Pinto Basin Road a bit less than  miles north of the southern Cottonwood entrance to Joshua Tree.,JoshuaTree,dgvyksv,2,t5_2taeo
