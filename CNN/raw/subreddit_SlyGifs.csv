8898891,0,t1_d7hi2pz,I would say anyone who picks up an object in a store and is running for the exit with that object has intentions of not paying for that object. What is sad to me is that this man is stealing beer. He didnt grab any food or any essential living items. But back to the main point. You are able to use force to detain someone that is shoplifting. I reasonable force like grabbing of an arm or using your body weight to hold them. Its kind of a grey area but as long as excessive force is not used then usually its alright. I would say this tape gives more than enough reasonable cause for that man to be suspected of shoplifting.  ,SlyGifs,d7hip9z,4,t5_3718t
