The program outputs a triangle mesh for each simulated frame which is then imported into Blender and rendered using Cycles.This animation showcases a new feature of the simulation program an anisotropic particle mesher. The new particle mesher constructs the fluid surface out of a set of ellipsoids d ovals instead of a set of uniform spheres. This allows the reconstructed surface to represent smooth surfaces while preserving sharp features of the fluid.The anisotropic particle mesher is based upon the methods described in this paperReconstructing Surfaces of ParticleBased FluidsUsing Anisotropic KernelsSimulation Details |  | ||Frames |  |Simulation time | . hours| Particle to mesh time |  hours |Render time |  hours  samples |Total time| . hours || |Simulation resolution |  x  x  |Mesh Resolution |  x  x  |Peak  of particles | .

11385711,0,t1_dfmi0ac,Writing the simulator involved a lot of reading and math but most of the time was spent programming trying things out failing and figuring out what went wrong.I followed the Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics textbook as a guide for implementing the fluid simulator. There is a free PDF that contains many important parts of the textbook hereFor the foam particle implementation I followed this paper Unified Spray Foam and Bubbles for ParticleBased Fluids This paper isnt too difficult to read and can still make sense even if all of the math equations are ignored.For the math it took a bit of understanding of differential equations for the fluid physics. Numerical analysis and linear algebra for making the physics calculations work well on a computer. And general geometry for the graphicsanimation such as triangle mesh construction and collisions. Im not a math expert but having a little experience with some of the subjects helped a lot.,Simulated,dfmjui0,5,t5_38484

11454784,0,t1_dfucos3,gtI build my own PCs and also own consoles.Same just saying that building a PC is not something that appeals to many people. It isnt laziness it is the desire to do something more enjoyable with their time. For some it can be really fun but for others it is just a new and confusing task that can be easily avoided by paying more. They would rather lose a little more money than have to struggle through something they dont care about. Isnt lazy to buy food instead of growing it yourself. And the netbook thing was just a bad example. Should have just said they could get a prebuilt gaming PC that cost a more for the same specs.,Simulated,dfue3ok,2,t5_38484
