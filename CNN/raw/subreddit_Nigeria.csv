3692670,0,t3_31z9tr,I agree with Dandue  it wont be a big deal that youre white especially since you will be living and working in expat central ie the VI Lekki area.My best advice to you however would be to stay close to any Nigerian friends you have. As a rule of thumb when traveling to any developing country youll have a much easier time if you know people who are local to the area because the best things are shared by word of mouth. No local friends  no word of mouth ,Nigeria,cqd6sui,1,t5_2qmdl

The practice itself according to Wikipedia is called Purdah and Nigeria is mentioned in the article.I know but I want to be sure about local usage of names. E.g. word burqa means simple hijab in Maldives and might mean a long gown not head covering in India. By the way what word and how is it written is used here for veil itself when guy in green demands Eleha to unveil? gt Muslims here tend to use the Arabic words for such things as they learn it with the religionNeither of these names appear in Quran or other Muslim holy scriptures. So its rather cultural I mean names and specific garments not custom itself.Thanks again!,Nigeria,d5bayxt,1,t5_2qmdl
