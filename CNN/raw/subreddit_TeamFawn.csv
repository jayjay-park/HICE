7661733,0,t1_d3cxpdw,My go tos Overnight oats I make the base of  cup oats  cup milk  tsp raw sugar. I like that with tsp thick coconut milk and  tbsp almond butter or dark chocolate powder with  tbsp peanut butter. Usually works out to be around ish calories. I make this the night before and grab and go. You can heat it up at work if you dont like cold oats. Breakfast sandwich English muffin egg lowcalorie sausage I like chicken jalapeno sausage from Trader Joes  the link is big enough for the sandwich and only  calories. I crack the eggs into a muffin tin and bake them. I make  sandwiches at a time on Sunday and eat them throughout the week. Grab and go reheat and add some hot sauce and its delicious! Usually around  calories depending on the sausage I use. Greek yogurt with addins I like to add  tbsp of silvered almonds Grape Nuts or coca nibs.  Avocado toast Toast a slice of bread I like wheat best in a toaster oven smash half a ripe avocado in the skin then spread onto the toasted bread. Sprinkle on top some salt and pepper maybe even some chili flakes. It is also great with a fried egg on top if you want the extra protein. Ive also seen sliced soft boiled eggs on it as well. Usually comes out to about  calories for me. Protein Box Knock Offs For mornings that I feel particularly snacky Ill pack a bunch of small things. Itll usually consist of a bread of some form toast English muffin baguette hunk no more than  calories some jam maybe  calories worth a piece of fruit and a small serving of cheese usually  calories. The fruit and cheese are cut up into pieces and I usually eat this slowly making sure to make each piece have at least  bites. Also goes well with coffee or tea.,TeamFawn,d3d3g61,1,t5_3dwiw
