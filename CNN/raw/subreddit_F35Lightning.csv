2211856,0,t1_clkqfa8,gtEODAS development started in  and Ive never heard it suggested that it was not planned in before AA was finalized.Where did EODAS come from? I didnt mention itgtIn fact according to this paper that studies JSF commonality page  the big factors behind SWAT was a combination of outdated method of modeling weight and unexpected commonalitydriven weight gains.Ill rescind what I said before but based on that what he must have been talking about was that managements use of parametric estimations to find total weight was causing them to say yes to a ton of small additions without them obtaining actual mass data of the component.gt Its not really crazy heavy when one is so much more capable than the other its simply that the B is in a completely different weight class and subject to different standards. Im not complaining that the jets heavy it has the thrust to meet that Im just pointing out the same thing you did that its in an entirely different weight class at x the weight of the Harrier but only  larger. As far as Im concerned though weight means capability especially considering the boost in materials technology since the Harrier.,F35Lightning,clkzaro,1,t5_33swv

3952210,0,t3_35qf8l,Yes another  reports in two months? GAOs stretching. Echoes the last sentence in the last link beautifully.gt Goures conclusion is that perhaps the problem is too many auditors reviewers and assessors chasing too few programs. They have to find something if only to justify their own relevance.,F35Lightning,cr6sani,3,t5_33swv

4429495,0,t3_3bs6j3,The full report confirms the idea that the original article was taken rather out of context as it primarily concerns the usefulness of the new features added to the control laws instead of the overall combat ability of the aircraft and releasing the documents after the peak of media outrage has hit is classy Mr. Axe. From the report it appears as if most of the issues that the pilot identifies could be solved with control law changes and that the high AoA ability isnt all that useful in a turning fight.,F35Lightning,csp10c9,5,t5_33swv

7304059,0,t1_d28ey1i,I always been told the ALIS couldnt necessarily be hacked because its a close looped system or whatever that means. Im not familiar with software so would that make it to where the only potential way for it to be put out of action is a simple malfunction or outage? ,F35Lightning,d28f7qx,1,t5_33swv
7389110,0,t1_d2i0ypp,If we insist on keeping a manned fixed wing gun platform in the inventory for use in COIN and other low threat environments Id argue that an A Skyraider refresh makes more sense than focusing on the A.The Skyraiders quad mm guns and their huge volume of fire would likely be more effective than the GAU against the infantry and light vehicles encountered in COIN operations.  The A is about half the weight of the A and accordingly carries about half the weight of external ordnance but it actually features about  more hardpoints which is great when you need lots of smaller munitions.  It features an armored cockpit and redundant systems as well as providing a larger combat radius and increased loiter time compared to the A due to the efficiencies of prop driven engines when operating in the low and slow regime.  The Skyraider also enjoys major advantages in acquisition and operation costs due once again to its smaller size and prop driven nature.I dont know that we need a dedicated manned COIN aircraft but if we do I believe the Skyraider fits the bill better than the Warthog.,F35Lightning,d2i3aq9,5,t5_33swv

8994405,0,t1_d7symwl,gtWhich is why its suspect to request a bid calling for entirely seater aircraft when it comes to the FAExcept as Ive already said the F variant is more suitable for small air forces the cost difference to the E variant is minimal and the F variant is more capable than the E variant.gtAllocating for a portion of the acquisition price as seaters for training purposes at a ratio reflecting the need for those planes as trainers could be a legitimate factor as reflected in the original F purchases way back in the day.What you seem to be forgetting is that Denmark is halving the size of its fighter fleet. When it comes to these sorts of decisions you have to account for and mitigate the risk of random fleet availability.If you have  aircraft with  being trainers and a flood takes out a dozen of your trainers its unfortunate but nowhere near the end of the world.If you have  aircraft with  being trainers and a similar flood takes out a single hangar where the trainers were youve now lost all capability to train new pilots.The logical answer is to have the number of trainers increased but that brings a multitude of complications regarding maintenance  spares  cannibalisation commonality combat loss reserves capability or size pilot progression  squadron structure pilot training  airframe handling familiarisation etc. One way to eliminate almost all of those issues is to simply go alltrainer. Yes you spend slightly more to acquire each jet and depending on how you fly them youll probably also spend more on flight crew. On the other hand you avoid other issues like having to buy extra airframes later down the line to keep the fleet ratio in check having to keep larger spares supplies and having to spend as much time training maintainers.Where it becomes wise to go with a mixed fleet or an entirely twinseater fleet depends on many things including geographic and geopolitical climate but at the size of fleet that Denmark is looking at for Super Hornets and considering how the F model Super Hornet isnt a typical trainer I personally believe and it seems that either Boeing or Denmark believes that going with an allFvariant fleet is the way to go. Hell half of the US Navys fleet is comprised of F variants and in their annual budget submissions they dont even differentiate between the two variants.,F35Lightning,d7szkz6,1,t5_33swv
