I was using the hatch charts for the river but when I looked up the photos of the listed hatches nothing quite matched.This fly isnt on the hatch charts.I am more of an impressionist fisherman.

There is also a popular belief here in Wales that perch love the colour red so it may be worth incorporating a bit of red and gold into a pattern?

2949203,0,t3_2txfbc,It depends a lot on what they are after. However almost any small mammal will make good dubbing for nymphs and wets. Alongside that small critters with soft pelts like rabbit and mink can be used to tie up zonkers. Generally speaking the best fur for our interests comes from mammals which spend a lot of time in the water minkseals etc as the fur tends to be more water resistant.....there are obvious exceptions squirrel tails and fox fur are also very handy!Away from small mammals deer pelts are great for making various deer hair ants alongside spun heads for flies like the muddler. Deer is quite versatile due to its inherent buoyancy and can be used for all sorts of dry patterns.  However ultimately Id see what you can get and then adapt from there. I befriended a couple of duck hunters a while back and gained access to all sorts of weird feathers mandarin duck anyone....the joy lay in being able to go off the map and experiment like crazy.  ,flytying,co3c6y2,2,t5_2sfbh

6519807,0,t1_cztg00j,Very solid attempt. A few other pointers for this fly Crowd the head with your thread a bit more which will help with the body taper Stop the body at the hook tip for a more balanced fly.  Extend the wing biots to the end of the body and try to suck them down to the body a bit more. A technique I was taught is to pinch the biots together on the sides of the fly when you initially secure them. As you tighten down the thread they will naturally draw to the center.     Watch your spacing on the body wraps with that gold thread. I count  turns on the body. You can get away with . personal preference Shorten the bottom hackle to the tip of the hook. You want it to just touch but not extend past the hook. All in all a GREAT first prince nymph! Its a very difficult fly to tie and youre a few minor adjustments away from a perfect fly.

8337943,0,t3_4tcoro,Another thought to add is that often times there is an abundance of insect life rolling crawling and drifting by fish. With so much opportunity sometimes an exact imitation is counterproductive to distinguishing your offering as being the best choice. I think in many cases when we think we have fooled a trout we have really induced a take using a trigger mechanism. Ie. wiggly rubber legs hot spots of unnatural color movement both in the patter and of the pattern and probably most importantly light reflectionssilhouette. Most of the really effective trout patterns are often impressionistic vs realistic representations. This is not because we are incapable of tying very realistic looking flies but because something that slightly differs from the background noise of whats coming down the food conveyor belt is what is needed to get eats. In a caddis blizzard hatch the last thing you want is something that looks just liek the millions of other real caddis flies. Your chances of getting eaten would be  in a couple million. ,flytying,d5jspmd,2,t5_2sfbh

They have a nice dull grey color which should eliminate some of the unwanted flash that brighter gold hooks have. Thinking of making the switch over from my usual flashy Dai Rikis since Blue Quill Angler no longer offers such a steep discount on  packs. All in all pending proven durability they seem to be a great bargain and an improvement on the old standard Stockard discount hooks.Oddly enough though the Stockards are manufactured in Korea and TMCs in Japan the magnetic holder in a package of Stockard nymph hooks had a TMC logo on it. I received some tiny TMCs in the same shipment and the packaging is pretty much the same with the Stockard label printing being a bit less polished.
