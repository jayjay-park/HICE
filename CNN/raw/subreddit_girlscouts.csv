1728432,0,t1_cjwy96i,Well we started with brownies but a handful of juniors mostly older sisters. We are the only troop accepting girls in our townthe other troop is only keeping the girls they started with and working their way up through the ranks so to speak. We take everybody cause I hate to turn a girl away. Anyway we tried to have separate activities but also joint ones. This worked ok because they were all new to scouting and so in the beginning they were all learning the same things. This year I have interest from several younger sisters who are daisy age and  girl has advanced to cadettes! Eeks! So now we have  grade levels and  leaders approximately  girls. I have another potential leaderadult volunteer. Were having a leader meeting tonight to see howif we are going to handle all this. Its crazy but a good kind of crazy. ,girlscouts,cjx17xn,1,t5_2tp33
2273323,0,t3_2l8i36,We are atheist Girl Scouts our troop leader is Buddhist and I have no idea about the rest of the troop though I assume theyre largely some form of Christian. My daughter just pauses and omits God when reciting the Promise. I have seen the promise printed with an asterisk next to God with the fine print instructing that the girl can replace or leave out as desired. Our leader went over the top explaining that Girl Scouts is open and welcome to any and all girls who want to join. Your experience may vary depending on the troop but they should be welcoming. I doubt our particular troop will be doing the My Promise My Faith project as its optional and our leader is aware of the varied beliefs. That pin is the only thing related to religion and even then I think it could be spun to an atheist view.Price well itll vary. There is likely assistance available through your council I know there is through ours. year gets you registered as a Girl Scout then the uniform costs whatever the website says plus the required identification patches try looking up starter kits on the GS website to get an idea of price. Troop costs will vary were a payasyougo type while others have you pay dues at the beginning of the year to fund everything. Cookie sales are the big ticket fundraiser that offset family cost.There are likely lots of different local troops. Contact your council and be a squeaky wheel if you dont get an answer right away. Sometimes theyre stretched thin and inquiries seem to slip through the cracks. Were a homeschooling family so we didnt care what local school we found a troop with it was more just searching for one that met on a daytime that worked best.,girlscouts,clsp9sk,1,t5_2tp33
2743924,0,t3_2p1u51,Okay. This is my husbands account but here is my two cents. Being in a troop is both like being married and its not. You are committing to a relationship with a troop you are in. So be committed to the troop you are in. BUT you are not married to your troop. There is no reason to stay in a troop out of loyalty. If you wouldnt want any other kind of relationship with this person then dont stay. The comments you have repeated are offensive and unGS like. Girls are impressionable. I would hate to think that those girls would learn to treat other people that way.  I have  daughters th and Kinder. My th grader loves to come to the Daisy meeting and help. She is patient and loves reading them stories. She is a good example of what older GS should be. If this other Scout attending your daughters meetings is not any of those things then she too needs to go. It sounds like you are fairly committed. Out of respect for this socalled Leader I wouldnt do it on meeting time. But you might want to reach out to the other parents and see if they are interested in joining you. Best of luck! ,girlscouts,cnfz0v3,1,t5_2tp33

7161949,0,t1_d0vls13,Im a little late but I just found this GS subreddit so Ive been reading through quite a bit today.  I completely agree with most of the comments on this page but thought Id add a few of my thoughts in case they are helpful!  A little bit about me  I started a troop  years ago I dont have any kids yet myself so I have a little more time and energy to invest to the GS troop than many leaders.  Started with first year brownies and this year is my first year with a multilevel troop.  second year Juniors and  second year Brownies.  For all  years Ive done all the planning and everything for cookies including being at about  cookie booths per year   Cookie time does get a little bit crazy but I love it so I dont mind!Adding the multilevel has been a little more challenging Im glad I didnt start this way!! but it has been more manageable than I thought.  Takes me on average  hours a week instead of  to plan everything for a meeting.To me it sounds like you would do a great job starting a new troop!  The girls really just need someone who really cares about helping them and making Girl Scouts fun.  You really dont have to invest a lot of time outside of the meetings.  So much is planned out for you in the badges just make sure you have the right materials and you are good to go!Feel free to reach out to me if you ever have any questions.  I love Girl Scouts and would be happy to help in any way!,girlscouts,d1s8tla,1,t5_2tp33

11187576,0,t3_5zoiys,You should be receiving a packing list prior to arrival. I suggest bringing two pairs of shoes in case it rains. Ones that are closed toe and tie. Dont necessarily have to be boots. I also suggest going through your closet and picking out pants and shirts that you wouldnt mind getting dirty. Jeans tshirts extra socks in case it rains.. Id start looking into toiletries you may need for the overnight. This is simple though. Walmart for example sells toiletry kits. Be the super hero that brings bandaids and a first aid kit since you are the leader. I also suggest starting to stock up on batteries for either flashlights or battery powered lanterns. Make sure you buy the right batteries though. The packing list will have on it things you will need like change of clothes sleeping gear sleeping bags usually even if you are in a cabin and if you are responsible to bring a dunk bag or not. A dunk bag is simply a mesh bag filled with reusable dishes that you clean after each meal. Highly economical in the long run and it teaches girls to clean up after themselves and to reuse things. Other than that it should be a pretty easy overnight. The camp directors will have the activities planned they will probably have a legit first aider and probably have the food thing figured out too. If you want to have more fun with it start collecting stuff from the dollar racks to decorate the cabin. Its a down time activity and will make the girls feel more comfortable. ,girlscouts,df03k2t,1,t5_2tp33
