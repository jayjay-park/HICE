4912480,0,t1_cudqqm5,I dont disagree with you at all and my thoughts on the matchup are that Sheik combos everybody well and wins neutral against everyone but with D being so tough to kill having an excellent recovery the fact that needles dont reflect gordos and Dededes kill powerEdgeguarding game that isnt so bad considering Sheik has a positive matchup with everybody else so it seems to me that D is as good a pick as any against Sheik. Im probably wrong just speculating and drawing from the little experience I have vs. Sheik.,KingDededeMains,cudr6dp,2,t5_398nh
4922227,0,t1_cudxwo6,My secondbest is Wario too. Hes much more solid against most of the speedies plus he shuts Sonic down which is probably not only Dededes worst matchup but the most lopsided matchup in the game.,KingDededeMains,cuezgu3,2,t5_398nh

6719108,0,t3_47hd78,I think the endlag on all his moves is fine except for Gordo Toss ftilt a poke that is unsafe on block at the extreme end of its reach in several matchups is not a poke and usmash. Those need significantly earlier FAFs.Dtilt hitbox fix for sure. Usmash and fair seem to have some zaxis weirdness causing whiffs as well.Bthrow is already a kill throw. It kills off the top  or  from a high platform. I wouldnt complain about it killing a little bit earlier but too much would be too good  the guy who can potentially kill you at  doesnt also need a free way to kill you at  or something.I dont think he needs landing lag reductions if he can SH AC fair it would also be nice to AC dair low enough to hit Mario in the head with it. Dededes should already be ACing all their bairs and uairs. Nair would be free with lower landing lag and its waaay too good to be free uair with lower landing lag could make the dthrow to uair drag infinite actually infinite. And while were talking about aerials how about fair being reverted to ? Dair being able to meteor grounded opponents might be worth trying also. As it is the sweetspot dair on grounded opponents kills roughly as well as bair does but we like already have bair for that and its like x safer.Gordo stamina yes a bit. But more important I think is returning the hitbox to its original size so that its harder to hit it back without trading. Also the hammer on sideB needs its hitbox to last more than a single frame. Also if you get hit out of sideB itd be really nice if you werent the only one that couldnt hit the idly bouncing Gordo to launch it  is that something you can change?Heavy armor on dash attack for sure. Heck super armor wouldnt be too much. Dash attack is blockable on reaction.One of Dededes biggest problems is that his jab is one of his most rewarding tools but it sucks. Jab hits frame  and doesnt properly link into jab. Too many characters can shield jab after being hit by jab then even roll before any followup to jab can come out. Some characters can even get hit by jab then jab you right back. Its silly.But the thing is the reward. Jabjabgrabdthrowbair is like what ? Who else gets that kind of reward off a jab? Like Little Mac back in the DS days Link and Fox before their jab cancel nerfs and nobody. And if your opponent doesnt know how to DI properly you can do crazy stuff like jabjabgrabdthrowfairnairdtiltjabjabgrabdthrowuair.So thats what I mean by jab sucking but also being really good. If you take away all the suck then its probably too good. So I would suggest that jab properly link into jab or jab comes out faster like frame  or . Both would probably be too much.Can you add hitboxes? If so an airborneonly hitbox on the bottom of fsmash that meteors might be nice.Oh and jet hammer! The jet hammer in the air is waaaaay too weak. Right now its sole selling point is that you can charge it while airborne making it useful for hopover punishes baiting countersdodges out of juggles and punishing successful Rests. If you could actually use it in the air I mean you can asis but its not worth it because bair is better then that would be nice.,KingDededeMains,d0ebbg5,5,t5_398nh
