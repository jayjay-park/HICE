3808461,0,t1_cqo43wr,I see your point.  I disagree and I feel that the show is justified in its use of goreviolence.  Theyre trying to build a world and show us just how messed up this fictional version of Hells Kitchen is.  This guy would rather shove his face through a spike than answer to the fact that he just gave up the crime lords name.  Sure they could have had that happen offscreen but the same could then be said about all the violencegore in any TV show or movie.To answer your question I think the scenes you mention are by far the worst in terms of gore level.  There are some brutal fight scenes but nothing so bad as the first few episodes.Also regarding plot and character development you have to keep watching.  You havent even met Fisk yet and learning more about him and what he wants to do and how he and Murdock have the same idea saving the city but very different executions of that is so fantastic.This show is more like a hour movie than a TV show.  Stick with it and the payoff will be worth it in the end.,Daredevil,cqqe823,1,t5_2rkj7

3824435,0,t3_34877j,Daredevil for me was a show to watch slowly not binge. I found myself bored when trying to watch more than  at a time. It really is a layered show with a lot of subtext. As far as no overarching plot... I think you might be missing something because there is absolutely an overarching plot beginning in the first episode and carrying through to the end. You may wanna re watch the first few I did and found myself understanding a lot better. Not sure how its a rip of ArrowFlash though.

3966522,0,t3_35p6pa,Agents of SHIELD is amazing. It doesnt really pick up until around episode  but the later episodes make it worth it to watch the earlier episodes. It has a really slow start but it gets really good a few episodes in around episode .Agent Carter is really good as well.  I highly recommend it.  If youve watched the Agent Carter one shot its like that but better.The Flash starts off as a generic superhero show but the plot is amazing.  It gets really intense starting episode  or  but is awesome from the first episode.I havent seen Arrow but its apparently a good show.  Season  is kind of bad but the rest of the episodes are pretty good.  The Flash crossovers in Arrow and vice versa really pull the series together if you watch both of them.tldr Watch Agents of SHIELD Agent Carter and The Flash.  ,Daredevil,cr8f1cj,2,t5_2rkj7

4969036,0,t1_cuiv88q,Regarding Mr. Bacon yes but not in a very long time. Im old and fat now.I do think piracy hurts the industry at least on some level. Yes people still pay to go to the theater but theres an entire industry of at home content that needs to get paid for as well. I actually think the studios are pretty in touch. For me paying  or  bucks to stream a full HD and less compressed than cable movie off my apple TV is totally worth it and far less hassle than finding some torrent somewhere risk getting fined and or getting a virus. As for the morality aspect I also believe its stealing and I do think its pretty wrong for that reason. Loss trickles down from the studios whether they have the money or not these are public companies that use any means to report losses so they pay less taxes. Who gets burned by that? No not you the audience or casual pirate. Me the guy at the end of the chain who is the last to touch the movie that they never have enough budget for. Subsequently the real injury comes down to all of the non unionized talent that make your beloved Jurassic Worlds and tentpole films. The guys at my shop that sweat it out for  hours to get that highlight just right or make that effect truly invisible. Since the can gets kicked all the way down the road its really all the craftsmen and women that pay the price. I support unionization. It would level the playing field for companies and secure great group rates on insurance and consistent overtime and pay scale rules for artists. These are things that companies that give a damn like shade already do. Id like to see my competitors that are lacking ethics be forced to treat their team like the hard working artists that they are. Additionally wed no longer be the only people who have a huge impact on the product whos credits come up after the caterers. Hey I love crafty as much as the next but really.. we are the LAST credits to come up.As for residuals Ill touch on this a bit further below but as it is now there are points deals that can be made. However they require you to invest in a film by giving all or a portion of the work in advance for free hoping to make a pile of cash if the film does well. This has not historically worked out well looking at you Digital Domain for the firms that participate. Do actors directors producers and any other above the line talent invest in the film to get their residuals? No they get paid for their work and if their work makes a fantastic movie they get a bonus. Of course the exceptions are investors that get an executive producer titleLastly I support trade organizations even more than unions even though they are separate topics. My competitors are in fact competitors but we all play in the same sandbox and if we could get together to create some amount of consistency in pricing scheduling and contracts... up to and including residuals it would be a lot easier for VFX companies to treat their artists better and keep more work here in the US. Additionally if we want to see an improvement to runaway production driven by overseas tax incentives post production and FX will need lobbyists to bring attention to the issue at a national level. A trade org could pool resources to pay for that.As it is theres always a new company undercutting your business at a loss to make a name for themselves only to evaporate in a pile of debt and unpaid wages. It helps no one and only contributes to the race to the bottom that is happening in many aspects of entertainment production today. If the vendors were to organize it would improve the situation for everyone.,Daredevil,cukvu9o,2,t5_2rkj7

The characters are different a lot of the time but both have fun stuff.Youre in for some good reading with Daredevil. When you read the Frank Miller stuff remember that its from the late s and early s. So it is dated a bit but you have to realize that comics werent really written that way before.

They had to set up Matt and Fisk and the other characters before bringing in Frank and Elektra. If theyd tried to bring them all in in season  it would have felt forced and would have deprived Matts character of a lot of depth.

7540315,0,t3_4ie0l0,I actually loved The Hand and felt like the early season stuff was very dry and poorly done. Until The Hand came in there was very little to keep me hooked aside from The PunisherI didnt like most of the dialogue from FoggyKaren. But the hand took up alot of the space that all the NelsonMurdock day to day drama had and balanced out the show.,Daredevil,d2zapp9,1,t5_2rkj7

7789311,0,t3_4m039s,Eh its all very subjective. For example he says the flash Stumbled a little in season two but doesnt give specifics then lists some problems with Daredevil that affected the pacing of the second season. The way I see it Daredevil S was better than Flash S but Flash S was better than Daredevil S. The reason being that they set a lot of cool stuff up in Daredevil season two but theyre not really going to get to it until season . Kinda like Game of Thrones season .In short Flash and Daredevil are kinda interchangeable as the top two. The real problem is that they rated Arrow Agent Carter and Jesica Jones above Agents of Shield.,Daredevil,d3rkprc,6,t5_2rkj7

9674451,0,t3_5cnj0h,I respectively disagree I like Foggy I like Elden Hensons portrayal of Foggy. Ive said to myself many times that a line wouldnt have worked if Henson wasnt on the delivery. I do like his relationship with Matt he and Cox have good chemistry and he has these great moments of standing up to people who are way stronger and more powerful than him.It is honestly the first time I have related to the friend of the superhero in one of these shows. I get his feelings of betrayal fear of losing his friend and respect for the law. Hes not like every person who found Olivers secret on Arrow  where they pissed and moaned for an episode and then just started enabling him.The show is prone to some over the top speeches and Pollyanna type moments but I can live with that. If you dont like him thats fine  you dont have to.  But I waned to voice a different opinion. ,Daredevil,da5kuuj,3,t5_2rkj7

We dont like anyone trying to tear him down even if its his best friend. But his best friend is also his partner career wise which requires for stronger professionalism and commitment than just friendship. Matt just found himself unable to balance the two. Bc being a superhero is a lot fuckin harder than it looks.,Daredevil,dg9xt78,24,t5_2rkj7
