2852540,0,t1_cnsawhb,I dont think the truth will involve anyone punching anyone or anything truly despicable but I do believe that it will be far from what anyone expected.Most will be left speechless and those that arent will do NOTHING but take their infuriation out on Arin. They will insult him harass him threaten him etc. It will be the final straw and Arin will give up on the Grumps fanbase entirely. Hell abandon the channel and the negative backlash will force Danny away from the community. Barry will have to come to terms with the reveal of a secret that he has been forced to hide and censor for years and hell want nothing to do with the community that basically threw his career out the window for nothing more than their own mindless curiosity. Ross will go back to animating his own stuff doing contract work and maybe even start his own gameplay channel maybe with Holly. Maybe hell include Danny Barry and Kevin in it. Maybe their dedication to their art will live on but it wont be as the Game Grumps.Suzy will stand by her husbands side and by Polaris. Shell continue to deny anything and everything related to the Grumps downfall and eventually the shitposting spillover will force her away from her own channel. Markiplier will try his best to include her in his stuff as a good friend would try to do. Hell insist Arin should join them but hell refuse. He wants nothing to do with YouTube anymore. Hes left Polaris at this point disowned his fanbase and no longer calls himself Egoraptor. He deletes his personal channel Suzy begs him to tell her why hes abandoning his famed monkier. He cant explain. The only rationale that nags in the back of his mind tells him that he doesnt deserve that name anymore.Eventually Danny realizes his true calling is true dedication to music. He moves to England to work with Ninja Brian fulltime and soon after NSP breaks into the mainstream. They go platinum they tour the world Danny starts a few sideprojects to get back into serious music. Maybe he reforms Skyhill or The Northern Hues. Maybe he forms a brand new band and  years from now former lovelies from around the world stare on in awe as he rocks the Superbowl halftime show out of this world. Jon stares out his apartment window watching as the New York skyline slowly vanishes under the wavering blanket of a lonely winters white breath. The year is  season  of JonTron has just begun and the future has never looked brighter for him. He closes his eyes Jacques pecks gently at a single tear cascading down his face. Dont be upset Jon. They had it coming and you couldnt have stopped it. These days it seems all Jacques ever does is try to reassure him but Jon just cant move on. He loved those guys they were his best friends and he still cant believe that it all could come to such an abrupt and miserable end. He opens his eyes again and stares through the blur of forming tears at the sparkles of the city night strung together like a paradoilic symphony. He can barely manage a single Ech as he slowly draws the curtains closed and turns away his voice barely transcending a broken whisper for the effort.I know I couldnt have stopped it Jacques he says quietly wavering on the verge of crying but I should have tried harder. I should have fought for those that I loved.I shouldnt have given up.And with that he walks somberly into his bedroom and closes the door behind him. Tonight he will join the sleeping city in its delicate winter dreams but he shall not find rest in his own. Jon knows he shouldnt blame himself but thats what people do when they lose the prospect of ever reuniting with the things they miss most dearly.And Jon knows in his heart he legitimately missed what he had in the Grumps. And maybe just maybe he always will.,ConspiracyGrumps,cnsc1ju,25,t5_2yb4a

2991720,0,t1_co828s1,gtEven the MiiVerse episode could hardly be called a coverup.Maybe you have some special inside information but from our perspective it is almost certainly a coverup or censorship of some kind. Jon has made it clear in the past that he doesnt mind being mentioned in the context of GameGrumps and potentially even implied that he liked it. So for the Grumps to go so far as to deliberately doctor out any mention of him? Well that doesnt half get all our juices flowing over at rConspiracyGrumps.I totally understand Arins position that they want the show to carry on being great and not get hung up on the loss of such a huge part of it but this is different. When a Miiverse post comes up saying Acknowledge Jontron! how hard would it have been to just go Yes Jon was on the show. Thanks for sending in! or yknow some other quip that they would do were it anything else?This behaviour of calculated removal from the show is as you have said not completely novel in the space of GameGrumps. Since day one we have not always been subjected to fresh unedited footage. But its undeniable that this is a very difficult way of dealing with a very simple issue and makes it seem like something deeper is going on. Something deeper that they want to coverup.gtI dont believe that there is any mention of Arin in any JonTronShow episode made after they split. Does that mean Jon was actively censoring Arin from his videos? I think not.These arent the same. Jon was a beloved and founding member of GameGrumps whilst Arin has only cameod in JonTronShow.,ConspiracyGrumps,co838fe,0,t5_2yb4a

This is how he knew long In advance all the glitches he could exploit in sadx. ,ConspiracyGrumps,ctpwqiq,2,t5_2yb4a

Because no matter what the reason is it will never change anything. The current status should have been the status at the very beginning and Im happy with it now.,ConspiracyGrumps,cua92e1,7,t5_2yb4a

5993827,0,t1_cy598gs,God watching arin smile and genuinely laugh during the raccoon part is the cutest thing Ive seen in a long time the fact that its improv makes it so much better. I think its part of the reason there is so much closure. I mean sure we see them in a photo together and they smile for the camera that makes them on the record officially friends. But that scene you dont act like that with someone you dislike that is friendship and that is real.,ConspiracyGrumps,cy5bkm8,12,t5_2yb4a
6204801,0,t3_3ysy8t,You make some good points but heres my thinking.  .  I personally dont think Jon would see doing a grumpcade episode a regression rather a nostalgic experience for both parties.. Game Grumps is still appreciated a lot by the fans and they dont take the popularity for granted. Theyre still expanding so it shows theyre not just seeing it as a quick buck.  But you do make a good point.  Jon just may not want to and its totally up to him.  But at this point I dont see too much stopping him. . The beauty of Grumpcade is that guests can be on spontaneously not like there was a REASON to have Markiplier on the show other than he wanted to be.  Besides Jon has said he sort of misses being on Game Grumps. . Jon streams on twitch from time to time.  Not to hate on it but it can hardly be compared to his own show.  Its just him at his computer playing and talking.  So its doubtful hes concerned about being on par with his show with everything else he puts out there. . Jon and the grumps still live far apart and it doesnt appear that will change anytime soon.  Therefore if Jon ended up being a recurring guest it wouldnt be often enough to outshine his presence on his normal channel.  Also Jons show is bigger than its ever been now.  Surely for him to appear on grumpcade it wouldnt take away from any of that.  . Jon doesnt seem very opposed to visiting California.  He even visited Ross last year and maybe came back more times.  If this grumpcade happens it would just be on Jons time like any grumpcade guest. . It would be up to them.  Its more than likely there would at least be something from just Jon and Arin but its really up to them.  Hes good friends with most of them so anythings possible.  The fans will get what they get.  . There wouldnt really be any kind of downside.  The grumps are already super popular.  Its not like it would piss anyone off to have Jon on.  It would make SEVERAL people happy.  Its a change but theyre not necessarily against change.  It would be more a respect to roots kind of deal.. I SERIOUSLY dont think that will be any kind of problem.  Apparently they had a lot of fun together on the set of Starcade.  Also take a look at the recent Spider Man  video they did with Two Best Friends.  They probably didnt know each other that long and despite several injokes from both parties scattered around it turned out to be one of the funnier episodes theyve done recently my opinion.  Jon and Arin have known each other a long time they managed to have chemistry for almost a year during Jon Grumps.  I cant see it being a problem at all.  Anyway thats not to say it will happen for sure but in my opinion it just makes perfect sense.,ConspiracyGrumps,cyux4mk,3,t5_2yb4a
