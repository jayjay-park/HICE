10659907,0,t1_ddfcbtz,Youre in the wrong sub if you conflate nullifying someones existence with questioning the legitimacy of white hegemony. Consider this your first warning. Reactionary trash isnt welcome here.,NegaRedditRedux,ddfhl40,6,t5_3itky
10908780,0,t3_5s292o,Eh depends what they mean. If the idea youre defending against doesnt support free speech then it effectively works against the other sides idea though yea it can also create false credit toward your own idea especially when its the only other option.,NegaRedditRedux,de55w30,1,t5_3itky

11380243,0,t3_62enf8,Its weird how reddit considers anyone with a zero tolerance stance for fascismracismneonazism to be a leftwing extremist.I actually always selfidentified as a liberal but reddit liberals will shun and attack you if you dont believe in their fight fire with hugs and kisses mentality.Maybe its because reddits main demographic is young white suburban males who have never experienced any real hardship. Not that theres something wrong with that but its probably easy to be sanctimonious and indifferent when youre part of the demographic that has the least to lose.,NegaRedditRedux,dflxjfx,37,t5_3itky

11542624,0,t1_dg4csmw,gt However morally good our entrance into the war ended up being in hindsight we were not acting in good faith internationally during the lead up to our involvement in WWII.In comparison to... whom exactly? What are you standards for acting in good faith?EDIT Just so you know where Im coming from with this...The US made it pretty clear which international actions it condoned and which it despised through public statements and policies such as sanctions against the Axis and deals with the Allies. They were neutral insofar as they had not entered the war on either side which is what neutrality actually means in this context.Sweden and Switzerland were neutral and still made proportionally more and bigger deals with Nazi Germany because thats where their economic and strategic priorities were. Spain was neutral and sent an entire division of volunteers to fight for Nazi Germany. Which of them was acting in bad faith?,NegaRedditRedux,dg4cwjk,4,t5_3itky
11757337,0,t1_dgsnktx,Pogroms? What are you talking about being a kulaks is about capitol not your ethnicity. And as far as I know there is no links between them and Jewish communities.And the starvation was the famine the kulaks only expanded the issues with their razing of the land.As for genocide? If you think that the way they were dealt with was genocide then I cant image how bad you feel for the poor people who the kulaks terrorized.,NegaRedditRedux,dgsq2p3,6,t5_3itky
