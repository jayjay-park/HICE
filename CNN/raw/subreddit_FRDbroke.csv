1339320,0,t1_cik743a,gt Oh and theres this weird makingup terms. Usestructure isnt a thing.Id actually really like them to start making up more terms. Misappropriating feminist terms is getting really old.,FRDbroke,cikaf6h,3,t5_31q7m
1753841,0,t3_2ejvt5,Id say its a parody of a feminist account. Professes to be a male feminist posts all the time about cuckolding and only posts to pretty deep bits of reddit  asktrp purplepilldebate cuckold incest and femradebates. Poor lambies have to make their own strawfeminists.Whats more disturbing is that it looks like they didnt get as many downvotes as the ambivalence to circumcision post ,FRDbroke,ck08a0h,4,t5_31q7m
1908977,0,t3_2ghqc7,gt For people who are more interested in discovering truth engaging in high level argument and seeking common ground? No not really.Truthseekers dont want to know about racism because racism is never true?. High level arguments cant be about racism because theres nothing worth discussing?. Is there no common ground to be found by agreeing racism is wrong? Moderators are picking a side here plain as day. Theyre tone policing because racism isnt trueimportant the only side allowed to talk. What almost amazes me is how cleanly down the antifeminist line this cuts. How is there not a single MRA concerned about social justice? ,FRDbroke,ckj7wv4,7,t5_31q7m

4837835,0,t1_cu44e6b,Its so hard to get a break as a white male. Just look at the U.S. every single POTUS has been a black woman all CEOs are women of color every tech company is teeming with minorities and all the violence we see on the news is whiteonwhite crime happening in white ghettos in NYC and Chicago. Truly the tragedy of our time. ,FRDbroke,cu4cih5,4,t5_31q7m
4969668,0,t3_3iyjf3,Christ on a cracker.gt Because he might be pointing to the historical framing of the issue that has long got lost in the last  years. From todays perspective it looks like an openshut case because the notion of rape is for a woman to not consent to sex the notion of rapehistorically was not so strongly tied to emphasis on the autonomy of the woman.They say this as if it explains and justifies the marital rape wasnt that bad BS when in reality it describes everything that was horribly wrong and gendered about the situation. YES we ignored womens consent NO that didnt make it more pleasant. They think whitewashing atrocity makes it notatrocious? Well that explains their relentless sophistry theyre making the world a better place!,FRDbroke,cukypei,7,t5_31q7m
