1284753,0,t3_28qw0z,FWIW a simple trick that I learned for removing stuck plastic pegs is to drill a small hole down the center then screw in a narrow selftapping metal or wood screw into the hole.  Leave a lot of it sticking out.  The threads will grip the broken peg and you have the back half of the screw to get a good grip on with pliers for pulling.  That way you can get broken plugs out of cups without damaging the cup itself.  ,saab,cie5gdl,1,t5_2rr20

1751883,0,t1_cjylepg,Not a huge mistake but an avoidable one. A stuck O is common enough and exhaust work is a pain in the neck.I found your down pipe on ebay and it looks like theres a lot of extra bungs for wideband installs and whatever else. After the cat theres two bungs which have an aggressive standoff compared to the upstream ones thats probably done in order to limit the responsiveness of the downstream O sensor and make the computer think everythings OK. Depending on how effective it is you might be fine with just a new O for a long time maybe for the life of the car.Otherwise youre down to the options I listed in your other thread. If you do ask Casey whether he can disable the O make sure to ask whether he can such that the car will pass OBD inspection with no more than one unset readiness monitor not just a visual istheCELon inspection. Because thats what youre going to need for NY and it will be very useful to know whether its possible to do with Trionic . Do post the answer here.,saab,cjzzedb,2,t5_2rr20

3084070,0,t1_cohhw5o,The CSE and the Aero both have the same spoiler but the Aero has lower wider side skirts a lower front and rear bumper no chrome on the door trim and doesnt have the little rubber things along the rubber trim of the front and rear bumpers. My  Aero also has some weird coating on the end of the side skirts near the rear wheels Im not sure if thats stock or not. If you look at my CSE the body trim is not paint matched to the car like yours is.EDIT Here by spoiler I thought you meant the rear one... sorry Thats very interesting about the hazards. SAABs have never really made a loud clicking noise but they do make a noise. Unless the scraping is threatening the integrity of the trimspoiler I wouldnt worry about it. You can actually buy some Rustoleum Satin Black wipe down the spoiler with alcohol and a scrubbie sponge and spray  light coats of it on the spoiler. Its kind of a pain to take it off but if you feel comfortable taping off everywhere around the spoiler and then painting it it should look pretty good. As to the front you can buy your color touchup paint from Amazon or eeuroparts.com. Usually there is a color code inside a door jam on a sticker. Color codes are manufacturer specific though so make sure you dont go buying a Ford paint with the same code. I just search Saab  Touchup Paint on Amazon.  being midnight blue the color of mine. I would suggest buying a spray can with a clear coat. You can do some good work to cover scratches with this. Watch a few youtube tutorials for spray painting. I did this to our Viggens bumper which was severely scratched and it turned out fine.EDIT Again thought you meant rear spoiler at first here  either way I did the Satin Black to mine and it looks good!EMBLEMS The gel emblems have lasted surprisingly well I just cleaned the surface of the original emblem with some alcohol and stuck them on. They form to the surface and look great. Mine has been on for over a year now and still looks like new.There were only   s produced and only  shipped to the US. They also got the cool exposed lug wheels.

3476047,0,t3_302aik,I would not buy a Saab with such high mileage without knowing why the previous owner got rid of it. From my personal experience  check the door locks that all  doors lock and unlock at the same time power windows weak motors or worn pulleys suspension crunching especially from the front engine block for leaking oil check the sides and hoses on the front look for oil in the power steering fluid caused by worn gaskets check the water pump engine tempoverflow reservoir alarm system that it doesnt go off randomly and definitely the battery.As far as longevity goes I posted a thread on here last week and could not find a single person with a year  Saab above K miles. That should tell you something. Mines at K and is an absolute disaster even though I have invested hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into maintaining it.Not saying yours is doomed but when it comes to used cars I dont believe in being blindly optimistic. ,saab,cpohtqx,1,t5_2rr20

After driving it for a week though I just fell in love and couldnt bring myself to sell it. Its super clean inside and out but was definitely neglected. Ended up putting double what I paid for the car into it but holy it drives like such a dream now. It a very classy change from my boyracer WRX thats for sure. But congrats on your purchase!

6073342,0,t1_cyfftxy,The engine is definitely capable of k more no sweat given proper maintenence.  The BR block is reliable overbuilt and by  had all the kinks worked out.  You can plan on mpg highway cruising which isnt too bad for a fast fullsize wagon.  It will definitely want premium gas itll run smoother and more efficiently.The rustproofing is good enough on those cars that if it was wellmaintainedwashedgaraged you shouldnt have any major rust issues.  Get it up on a lift to check the usual trouble areas any northeastern mechanic should have an idea about that.  So far as the car wearing out yes the suspension wear bits will definitely need doing by k.  Spark plugs are a good bet too.  See what kind of maintenance records it haswhat jumps out at the mechanic.  I dont know where in the NE you are but if youre in the capitol district area of NY Id recommend Rocks Precision Autothe guy who runs it was a Saab master tech before openinig his own shop.  The turbo is possibly going to be an issue by that age depending on use cycles etc.  The transmission would be my one point of concernmake sure theres no slippinghesitation and perhaps check the fluid?  The auto in those cars is quite good so it should jump out at you if theres something wrong.  Oh and expect to replace the Direct Ignition Cassette a couple hundred bucks every k miles.  Takes min with a screwdriver to do though so dont pay someone for that labor.Big picture it could go either way if the transmission is still good and it has a decent maintenance history then you probably wont be in for much worse than basic suspension bits.  Synthetic oil in them regularly is a must.  But if the transmission is bad andor it doesnt seem to have been well maintained look elsewhere.  ,saab,cyfpa8y,1,t5_2rr20

The fact that its a rebadged Trailblazer is a plus at this stage because it means theres tons of community knowledge about these vehicles DIY guides howtos etc. Check out gmtnation.com full of helpful and knowledgeable people.What I like about the car is the combination of RWD good weight distribution limited slip diff on the rear axle AWD and a little bit stiffer suspension rated as sport but its not that hard. This all makes the car handle and corner very well  definitely better than any frontengined FWD car.Its a good car with plenty of room good stability on the road reliable engine no known apocalyptic issues just stuff like thermostat water pumps going transfer case shift motor the usual stuff and most of it DIY friendly and not expensive.

Make sure the latest version of the pcv update is installed check YouTube for video on how to identify. Typical oil leaks include the crankoil pump seals which will show up as oil leaking just inside the passenger tire and will cover the control arm and accessory drive if bad enough. Look over the intake and down the back of the engine youll see the top of the cat if its wet you probably have a leaking oil pressure switch. Neither the switch or crankoil pump seals are hard to do or expensive but they are good negotiation points. The passenger side of the engine will be tough to see because of the engine mount so bring a light and peer through the holes to see. Make sure youve got sound from all  speakers so you know both amps are working. SID little display above radio will probably have dead pixels another easy fix but more room to negotiate. Youll also see any faults present displayed on the SID upon starting the car. Brake light failure and service theft alarm are common. Theft alarm is usually dead siren batteries and brake light failure is obvious usually one of the five bulbs in the high mount is bad or going bad. If it has xenon headlights make sure they both self level correctly as they do fail often and cost a bit to fix. Other than that you can feel a lot by simply driving Aeros are stiff so youll hear clunking if shocksstruts are going out the rears especially are known to fail often. Look for any smoke on startup and under hard acceleration the td turbos are pretty robust but can fail if the pcv updates have been neglected as well as oil changes. The  isnt as know for sludge issues so you dont need to worry too much about that. They are fun cars but with common failures like anything else whats listed above are the most common things I can think of. ,saab,d9b5d1d,2,t5_2rr20

10673341,0,t1_dc8gm3h,sometimes its the dealers that are shady.  when I bought mine the rd brake light cover was in the trunk when the salesperson checked over the car before selling she tried to take it out saying it didnt even go with that car had it not been for the fact that I could see red in the rear window I wouldnt have caught it.  They also apparently took the ambient temp sensor off the car I had to call them to see if they had it in their shop and after  weeks they called back saying they had just bought me a NOS one since they offered me a warranty on missing and defective parts.  I guess they werent really that shady but still.  They chose not to cover the water pump when it was making noises within the first  weeks.  Other than that the car has been very good to me aside from a Saab shop fucking up the splash guard under the bumper and scratching several parts of the car.  if anyone lives near Myrtle Beach DO NOT go to AutoHaus. The owner is an old asshole who breaks cars before fixing them.,saab,ddgvhmt,1,t5_2rr20

11386324,0,t3_62g9g3,Its a tough question really. What could go wrong? Everything I guess? Its the same as buying any used car with k or more miles. If its been well maintained and k is very little driving for a car from  you should be able to get another k mileage out of it easily without running into major problems. If the intake has been taken care of already and the car is in good shape with regular maintenance done on it I see no reason why a   with only k miles on it couldnt get you another  to k with no real problem. Probably even more mileage than that but its hard to say when the dial passes k. This again presumes the car has been well taken care of already and that you will also keep it up to date with regular maintenance. Youre looking at a set of tires probably and other maintenance but you should be clear of any and all major transmission or engine problems. If the car has been questionably taken car of and hasnt had the intake fixed yet than its a toss up. You could still get another k out of it. You may only get . You could run into major repairs constantly or never have an issue. Its hard to know. Same as any used car. And of course when buying any used car theres always a random sorta luck factor involved as well. TLDR if you find a  or   with only k miles clean CarFax that shows very regular maintenance done on the car to keep it in prime condition you should get another  minimum out of the car without major repair. If the cars history and maintenance schedule is sketchy it could last  months or  years. Its less about the model and more about the specific car youre looking at. ,saab,dfmmcji,4,t5_2rr20
