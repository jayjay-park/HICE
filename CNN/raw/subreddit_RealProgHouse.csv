It was basically what prompted me to create this website If Beatport isnt going to change at least I can try and help peoples perception of what actual progressive house is.,RealProgHouse,cv5da3m,1,t5_2w8e7

8193406,0,t1_d51hjzm,The term EDM has become interconnected with big room house trap brostep etc. because the people that tend to follow those genres just call everything EDM. So you have two camps those that see it as shorthand for commercial dance music and those that take it literally as an umbrella term. Personally the only time Id find the umbrella version of it useful would be to describe the music I enjoy to someone outside of the scene but I usually just say dance music.,RealProgHouse,d51q74t,3,t5_2w8e7
