Direct patient care hours are an important requirement of PA school and if you can find a way to get your EMT certification soon and are able to start working that parttime I highly recommend it. There are other options you could also pursue to get these hours so figure out what would work best for you and start preparing for it.Get involved with extracurriculars student orgs and volunteering as soon as you can so you have a wellrounded application.

7260852,0,t3_4etetj,Holy racebaiting batman! I see no issues with this.   Why other commenters feel this response was a bit much is absolutely beyond me. Miss Hannah Franks analysis of The absolute disrespect caused by coming into a students classroom and embarrassing them in front of their peers is inexcusable is in my opinion utterly ridiculous. It seems there was a simple route this individual could have pursued to avoid this situation of embarrassment dont break the law.  Her bias towards her coworkers arrest is on full display as she attempts to make this a racially motivated issuehence the TheRealUW. Her post lacks grounding in reality and seems to be more of an emotional plea to guilttrip people rather than present a rational discourse. Given the alleged threatened to kill a witness of his crimes Im amazed he was not arrested quicker if anything. TheRealUW is indeed a place where people are arrested for breaking the law. ,UWMadison,d23iacs,21,t5_2s97q
7345343,0,t3_4fszuh,Most difficult and worst grade EPD . I hate writing. That being said I actually very much enjoyed going to class because Mike Shapiro is an excellent professor.  He was also extremely helpful outside of class I definitely would have had a much lower grade with any other professor.Best class Theater  Entertainment for Engineers.  Super interesting very easy lots of knowledgable guest speakers in the entertainment industry and the professor is also extremely knowledgable and has a lot of experience in the industry.Edit I lied. Best class is without a doubt Legendary Performers taught in the Spring semester by Leckrone.  Leckrone is awesome and half of the studying is listening to awesome music.,UWMadison,d2d451q,1,t5_2s97q

Instead focus on positive things you do want to do that just happen to be nonalcoholic rather than nonalcoholic being their whole goal and reason for existing. Get into sports. You cant drink while swimming in a pool or running laps or whatever you are into. Find a physically active group and you wont have to be so focused on whos drinking or not. If all your friends are drinking are you are just sitting home by yourself staring at the wall of course you are going to feel left out but thats on you.,UWMadison,d2xfqa2,6,t5_2s97q
