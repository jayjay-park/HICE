I have a collection Im selling off and i wanted to start off simple but I didnt get any inquiries. So i read more into the sub and saw that broader listings tended to get more notice. Took alot of work but thats why i got this listing up right now.Look Im not trying to screw anybody. I was under a previous profile for a year and dropped that to change to a name i like more. Id be more than happy if it would ease your mind to link my profiles of Ebay and Amazon to show my feedback.TLDR in all sincerity Im legit just struggled to learn what gets attention on here the last few days.,comicswap,cjpo3h6,3,t5_2sqxv

A constant reminder of what couldve been if I didnt screw up. Maybe Im strange and go about stuff differently. gtNot really  Jason Todd was killed off because the fans voted to have him killed off. It was a marketing game. The arc was crafted so that things could go another way. The only interesting thing about it was how vicious it was but it wasnt unique by any means  it was still firmly in the time of the dark anti hero thanks to Millers awesome Daredevil work among other things.Im talking about in the comics not necessarily how the story was to read. but the effect it had on batman in the comics themselves. I havent read anything batman in the post crisis pre flashpoint universe but from what I have gathered is that it had a profound effect on batman and how he did things.

I was shown prices on eBay when in reality they were lower gradeswhich means lower price! and was trying to be convinced that me following the guide was ridiculous lolmeanwhile most dealers who make money use it. All Im saying man change those prices or do some research before posting man because thats way off what they are worth. I was interested until I seen the pictures and thought I should say something because why not let people know its way overpriced? Like I said I dont go around doing this like some people in this sub but when I saw this how could someone not say something?
