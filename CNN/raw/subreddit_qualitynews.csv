6259129,0,t1_cz119tq,As an example of what I mean by safety someone living in Kabul Damascus or Baghdad lives in a relatively safe city within an unsafe country. Yes they have suicide bombing occasionally but that doesnt mean they have a statistically significant risk of being killed in their day to day lives. Honestly Id feel safer in any of those cities than I would in Detroit. Im also not opposed to economic migration. Just with the stipulation that it be done through legal immigration measures and not blitzing the border.Its definitely a gray area. I like it as a deterrent but not in practice. Honestly they should consider just implementing a marketing campaign discouraging people from coming at all. Illustrate basic living conditions cold weather and most importantly emphasize that western women are not all whores to be molested at will. Also inform them that Europe has openly gay and trans individuals and if they cant accept that then they should not come.

Secondly I think you have to take the man for his words that he wants to unify the country and well see whether hes able to do so.Its hard to unify the country though withthe news media being so split up. When I was president the media mattered a lot more because there was like three of you and now theres all kinds of information being bombarded out and people can say things anonymously. Its just a different world.Its hard to unify the country though withthe news media being so split up.....wow look at that i guess theres is two sides to every story its easy to manipulate what a person said as a whole by taking just out the parts you like and publishing it....its like im a real modern day reporter now ,qualitynews,deayzt6,2,t5_2r20f
