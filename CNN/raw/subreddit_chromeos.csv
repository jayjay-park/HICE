The HP has some lag if I have an excessive amount of content running at the same time but for day to day use it really is hardly as big of a paint as people claim it to be on this subreddit. Battery life is the usual second complaint of this device and I would have to agree. I really wish the battery lasted all day but it just doesnt hrs of typical use for me. But here is the interesting thing. It uses a microUSB charge and to be honest I am in love with this concept and dont think I will go back to any other way of charging a chromebook. I left my chromebook charger at a coffee shop  weeks ago and havent had much trouble because of all the microUSB charges I have laying around. So the battery life is a problem but not really. Love the way this thing sounds looks and feels. People constantly think Im working on a Mac air. Even when I hand them the computer to use in browser.

Thats why Chrome Apps like Caret Chrome Dev Editor Polarr Camera Text Marmoset Minilock baseflight etc. all run well offline  even on a brandnew Chromebook that you just signed into for the first time.But everything on Chrome OS including parts of Chrome itself are run in sandboxed environments with limited privileges. This is part of what makes the OS safe. Compare installation of new software on OSX or Windows. Every time youre entering your password for an installer or accepting a UAC prompt youre basically giving the keys to the kingdom to whatever you just downloaded and trusting that it wont do anything bad with those powerful privileges.

2601476,0,t1_cmy2vc3,That makes a lot of sense. And of course none of the manufacturers want to create more premium Chromebooks they always have to be sub  computers or inferior devices that manufacturers dont want to put their all into. Which is unfortunate because Chrome OS would gain more traction in the market if there were more higherend options. Chrome OS is increasingly becoming a viable option among the bigger players like Mac OS and Windows. I hope in a few more years our cultural perceptions will change and people will stop seeing Chrome OS as incomplete or lesser than the other options especially considering that a lot of people including me are perfectly fine using a Chromebook or Chromebox as their primary or only computer. I understand why companies are afraid to create higherpriced premium Chromebooks but its still unfair. The only reason there isnt a market for premium Chromebooks now is because nobody has made a premium Chromebook yet. Excluding the Pixel which was . created as a reference device for Googles partners and not created for consumer use and . released way ahead of its time.

Things like better a spellchecker OK Google hotword and unlocking your Chromebook via your Android phone are all in there hidden away.Once youre comfortable with all the standard settings hit up chromeflags for some bonus features still undergoing some testing. My favorite flag at the moment is the one that makes the scroll bars hidden similar to mobile devices or Mac.If youre really feeling bold you can switch it to the beta or dev release channel. However Id advise against dev if you need your computer dependable Ive had weeks of it being unusable waiting for the next dev update. I currently ride the beta.The different channels unlock even more on chromeflags each and if you use a MacWindowsLinux machine you can even visit chromeflags on them as well.,chromeos,coddkj4,1,t5_2r1wh

3058138,0,t1_coeyyvz,gtSo basically youre saying if I leave the laptop in my backpack and the battery drains completely when I boot up I will lose my entire development environment?From what I have read yes though I am not positive if that is a device specific problem or one that affects all Chromebooks. Most of these things I have only looked into for the Acer  models.Even with the ability to fully install Linux on the Acers custom distro respins work the best beacause of all the default non working issues such as touchpad touchscreen keypad shortcuts or suspendwake. And even with the custom distro a custom bios needs to also be installed to get the device to wake from sleep properly without loosing sound completely And this is pretty much the best supported Chromebook out there so really if you want Linux the Acer is really the best option but even then is a pain to set up as there are a ton of workarounds needed. Despite all the people that say how great Linux is on their Chromebook dont let that fool you into thinking it is perfect as with most things Linux it is not as stableeasy as everyone makes it out to be.,chromeos,coez1ns,2,t5_2r1wh

Youll hear it referred to as a powerwash most often.The image looks like this Im happy to answer any questions!  Im very new to all of this Ive had my Chromebox for only a couple of months but Im a huge champion of the Chromebox and I dont think it gets enough love.

3363927,0,t3_2yp9rq,Hey there thanks for the suggestion.Unfortunately and I say this in all seriousness no one reads the sidebar or submission screen. People skip over that stuff nearly every time they see it.As an example we have text in place on both the sidebar and submission page that clearly states that we are not a support community. We even provide a handy link to the support forum. Since we implemented that posts asking for support havent decreased at all. They havent gone up either thankfully.We also need to be careful because although most of the posts you are talking about are indeed things we cant help with there is a rare edge case that require attention. If a buyer receives a used Chromebook that is still enrolled or a student purchases their Chromebook at the end of a school year and it remains enrolled there are dedicated support processes for those situations.If posts like that are spotted we will want to direct them to the correct resources. Sometimes that is just saying contact the school but weve had several where we had to break out the official form and everything At the end of the day though what youre really suggesting is that we actively remove those posts when we spot them. That would add to the moderation overhead and we really cant commit to that until we start adding more mods to the team. Were currently doing our best to keep a lid on the support threads and the Linuxrelated posts that spill over.We really do appreciate the suggestion though and well consider it more if there is a sudden surge in these types of posts or if we add more mods.Thanks!,chromeos,cpbpoci,1,t5_2r1wh

I also like using it to search google for similar images.  Hover Zoomhoverzoom.net Zooms in on images as you simply hover over them. Great for seeing images on Reddit without clicking on them. Works on most sites including google images Checker Plus For Gmail Highly recommended. This app will glow and tell you how many unread emails you have. And will even pop up on the screen showing you what you got an email from. You have the ability to read the emal without going to the site. If you dont have a gmail MAKE one and use this! Checker plus For Google Calendar Optional but I find this to be really handy for being able to see the days of the week easier. It even shows birthdays for your gmail contacts. If you pay like  cents you can unlock both this and the gmail checker app for a FEW more features. Tho you dont have to and the app is useful without those features Downloadr If you dont like the downloads showing up on the bottom bar and having to clear them out manually you can just use this app to have your downloads moved up to the top as a button just like Firefox. Magic Actions For Youtube A handy app for Youtube much like RES. I like it for its lights out feature also. The switch is near the youtube logo on the top left btw. If you dont have good internet like a  MBps connection I recommend choosing auto HD and set it to p. Worse quality but the videos buffer faster and you use up less bandwidth Keep Awake If you set this extension to the moon icon your chromebook will never auto sleep. Instead the screen will auto shut off but keeps your chromebook on. So it only just kills the auto sleep if you dont like it Speed Dial  VERY customizable new tab page. This will make a whole lot of a difference for your browser. If you can mess with the settings you can make a really nice New tab page! Power Saver This is actually a theme for Chrome and if you like having your browser darker for your eyes this is a good one. I dont think it literally saves any power though. Only for CTR monitorsOther Chromebook tricks three finger tap to open a link in a new tab or hold ctrl while clicking a link to open it in a new tab. Some useful sitesText Now free texting to phonesclipconvertercc Download Youtube videos or convert them to MPminutemail Make a temporary email to create accounts on sites you dont care aboutPastebin Permanently save text here on the cloud where you can also share it. Useful for keeping tutorials for future reference. Google Play Music upload up to  songs for free No matter where you got the song from. Any song can be uploaded regardless of size or length. Best place to keep your music on the cloud. It works with your google account and you can listen to your music on any device.

I would always say if the cost isnt too much go with GB whenever possible.Chromebooks have native Netflix support so theres that going for it. In terms of live sports I cant say Ive tried although it would probably depend on the service youre using. I can tell you that SkyGo and the likes will if not already unsupported are very close to being dropped as Silverlight support is being axed by Google. I can try a few specific sites if you like if theyre nonsubscription based.The Acer Chromebook   and  all have the same great keyboard its one of the highest rated keyboards out there. A lot of the keyboards though are well built and are very comfortable for typing on I cant say Ive heard of any that werent liked by people but the best thing to do is just check out a few reviews on any Chromebook youre interested in.

And it has enough cpu horsepower to make it a proper main machine.Everytime one of wifes friendsbusiness associates see hers they want one  and she ends up ordering it for them. Its crazy in a nice way!The only machine I see that I might like to upgrade to now is the new i. Otherwise Im sticking with this thing as my daily weapon of choice. And I drive my machines hard  running s of tabs in firefox obviously it doesnt keep them all in memory at once with  terminal windows open inside gnuscreen vim with  buffers open vnc viewers on other machines vpn sessions with streaming video over pipelight etc etc.the only reason I say this is to show that you CAN use this as your main machine and drive it hardShe did order one of the newer Tegra HP s once but I made her return it in favour of a Haswell.Bottomline stick with Haswell or Broadwell and you wont regret it.,chromeos,crwsn7e,0,t5_2r1wh

With a more conventional keyboardlayout like a membrane or a thicker PC laptop you can dip Qtips in rubbing alcohol and press down on the head so its as thin as possible. You can then slide the tool in under the keys and remove gunk that way.

5494311,0,t1_cwdxbho,I disagree but even if you are correct the idea of using a  year old chromebook just sounds absolutely awful. Consider too that googles end of life policy for chromebooks is  years so for the  last years you will be running unsupported software.  Also its impossible to predict how far things will advance in  years.  Just in this last year we are starting to see ips screens and convertible form factors take over in chromebooks when that wasnt an option before so there will be advancements across the entire hardware spectrum beyond just processorram that a person who keeps a chromebook for  years will miss out on purely for the dogmatic choice of Im going to keep this for X  of years.The entire point of a chromebook is that it is an exceptional value for the moneyits cheap.  By purchasing something inexpensive like a chromebook part of what youre getting is the ability to upgrade a year or two or three later as tech advances your needs change your computer breaks or you just feel like a change and you can do this because you didnt spend a ton of money in the first place.  For example a macbook starts at .  You can get that and maybe itll last  years maybe it wont.  Either way that money is spent.  If a person were thinking about spending that money but were also in consideration of a chromebook that would meet their needs I would personally think its a lot smarter and will be a better user experience to buy a very nice chromebook now like the Dell  for  get a few great years out of it and then do the same thing with a far more advanced and current machine when they decide to upgrade.  If that dell doesnt need to be replaced then that person saved  versus having purchased the macbook.  The end result is the same or less amount of money spent between  yr macbook vs   or even  chromebooks but the experience will be far far better for the user with the latter decision as they are getting to enjoy current technology along the way.,chromeos,cwdy7os,1,t5_2r1wh

While  gigs would do what you want  will futureproof things a bit as others have suggested.Check out options from Acer and Asus first. They both make solid machines with good reputations. If you can bump your budget up a bit Dell  is magical.Once you find something you like maybe consider refurbished models to save a bunch of money. Check sites like Groupon Woot Amazon Newegg.

Also on a live chat with a rep on the Google store when asking about availability of the i variant I was told there was no information on when it may be back in stock and it was suggested I could consider getting an i model whilst they remain in stock.

6759503,0,t1_d0i8wuo,gt Your XPS  it has gb of ram correct? My XPS has  GB of RAM. These computers and almost all ultrabooks for that matter have solderedon RAM so you cant upgrade it. As someone who wants a futureproof computer that will last  years I definitely wanted as much RAM as possible. I figured I could always upgrade the SSD if I wanted and every benchmark I checked found negligible differences between the i and the i so I skimped on those two options and spent the difference on the increased RAM.gt Re XPS   the thin bezels.... slays me. And is a major factor in my purchase.Its seriously amazing. I feel kinda lame saying that seeing as thin bezels have absolutely no effect on practicality durability etc. But as long as Im on my computer  hours per day I might as well enjoy looking at it right?gt So you are saying the trackpad for the XPS is similar to the Dells?The trackpad on the Dell XPS and Dell Chromebook  are very similar  likely identical. When I was writing my comparison I put both computers sidebyside and used the trackpads simultaneously. When you really focus its possible the Chromebooks has slightly more resistance but honestly Ive had my XPS for about a month longer than my wife has had her Chromebook  so its possible mines just more broken in. The highuse area in the center of my trackpad has a shiny area where the very top of the coating has been worn away. Its only really noticeable under direct light and I cant feel a difference between the shiny region and the more matte borders with my fingertips. Her computer has a similar shiny highuse region in the center.I love the trackpad. I used her MBP frequently when she still had it and Apple computers are the holy grail of quality trackpads. I never tested the MBP and my XPS sidebyside but I would not suggest that theres any appreciable difference between the two. I have callousy fingertips from playing guitar so maybe thats why...gt would you say both keyboards are comparable? Is the Dells also mushy?The XPS and CB keyboards are identical. Regarding their mushiness I mean theyre ultrabook keyboards. They dont feel anywhere as good as the MBP. My work laptop is a Dell Latitude E and it has a much better keyboard. Probably a  deeper key travel and slightly higher keyboard resistance. I doubt any ultrabook keyboard is all that satisfying. I didnt find the Macbook Air particularly enjoyable. I have a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MXclear switches. Compared to the laptop keyboards it feels like the keys are damped with hydraulics. Everything feels mushy to me after using that. I really didnt like using the laptop keys all day so I use my mechanical keyboard with both of them Synergy is ridiculously amazing btw.Anyway long story short  theres no difference between the Chromebook  and XPS  keyboards. Theyre equally disappointing when compared with real keyboards. That said when I take it on the road without a separate keyboard I dont really notice any hindrance upon my typing. Just sort of a neutral lifeless typing experience  not an actively bad one.gt One thing I like about Chromebooks is their workperfectlyoutofthebox natureChromebooks really are king in that dept. Windows is a pain in the ass. I hate drivers forced updates antimalware programs bloatware etc. I would never recommend Windows to anyone. I hate Windows. I tried Windows . and  on this machine for a week just to give it the old honest college try and almost went crazy. Going back to Linux was like getting under a blanket with my wife after shoveling snow.I dual booted Linux Mint and Windows for a bit before I wiped everything and installed Arch. Linux Mint was awesome. Worked perfectly. Multimedia keys hibernate lid openshut everything. I would absolutely go that route. Even if you dual boot. It ran Chrome just as nicely as the Chromebook has all the flexibility of Linux without the warts associated with Developer Mode and is infinitely tweakable.gt Have you tried throwing Chrome OS on your XPS w Neverware?Dont see the need. My computer is as lightweight as possible gets ridiculous battery life and runs Chrome like a champ. I like that I have the flexibility to check out Firefox from time to time. I mean technically Im running Chromium currently. ChromeOS would be a downgrade from my current setup.gt Going to be honest your post is indelibly helpful and wonderful and useful but now also leaves me in nomans land re which to choose.I think I can help in that department. Frankly despite the Chromebook  being an amazing ChromeOS experience I have a hard time recommending it over the XPS . It took some doing but I have tweaked my XPS  to a point where it is superior to the Chromebook in almost every way. The Chromebook boots faster its seriously mindboggling and has better battery life maybe but even if it does  its like  hrs vs  hrs. Apart from that the XPS has better hardware i vs i thin bezels carbon palm rest  GB SSD etc if you dont care about webcams and it has a wildly more flexible OS. If you install Linux and encrypt your home directory then you have equivalent security to Chrome OS assuming you run the CB in developer mode which negates the sandboxed protections of ChromeOS. Above all I believe the XPS  to be more futureproof than the Chromebook . I know lots of posters in this forum will rightfully object but the announcements late last year of merging Android and ChromeOS worried me. Googles assurances that it was committed to ChromeOS smacked of PR damage control to my ears. On one hand Google will support the Dell Chromebook  until mid. On the other hand if Google decides to monkey around with combining Android and ChromeOS in  as that article reported then nothing good can come of it if youre a Chromebook devotee. Best case scenario you can stay in the ChromeOS ecosystem if you want but what little development there is now will wither up and die. Worst case scenario your Chromebook will take as long as an Android phone to boot my Nexus  takes like  seconds it seems and be less secure. At that point you could load Linux onto it but you could do that to an XPS too.The XPS on the other hand is a wildly popular ultrabook. I have more faith that Dell will manufacture parts for the XPS for much longer than the CB and that if I really need to Ill be able to find XPSforparts listings on eBay for years to come. The Chromebook  is definitely the best nonPixel Chromebook but for my money its strengths are mostly matched by a Linuxy XPS without any compromises. You could always buy the Developer Edition of the XPS and have Ubuntu right out of the box. From there its straightforward to uninstall Ubuntus bloatware in a way its not with Windows and install Chrome. Or you could install Cub Linux formerly Chromixium I ran that for a few days and really liked it.Sorry that ran long. I had a really hard time making the same decision youre struggling with. In fact I did buy a Dell Chromebook   iGBtouchscreen. It sat in my living room unopened while I waited for my XPS  to arrive. Once I got the XPS  I sent the CB back. I havent ever secondguessed that decision.,chromeos,d0ihmcr,3,t5_2r1wh

6889653,0,t3_4a3r8y,I dont think ChromeOS is going away in fact seeing how lean and fast it is Id expect it to be the base for the future android  chromeos hybrid instead of the other way around. Its already possible to flash two different replacement roms on your chromebook one is the John Lewis RWLegacy this one lets you keep chromeos and dual boot it with GalliumOS a lightweight linux distribution specifically targeted for chromebooks. The other one by coolstar the one Im running now removes the ability to run chromeos but allows you to install windows  any flavor of linux and even remix os. For this second one you need to disassemble the chromebook to remove a write protect screw and sticker no other tools needed besides a screwdriver.Its also possible to upgrade the SSD Ive replaced it with a GB one Im currently able to triple boot windows  gallium os and remix os and the  of them work beautifully.So even if google stops updating chromeos in the future there are plenty of ways to keep this chromebook running.,chromeos,d0x9cqq,1,t5_2r1wh

If you flashed RWLEGACY and changed the ChromeOS firmware boot flags GBB flags then you just need to restore ChromeOS using the recovery media then boot ChromeOS and reset the flags.  If you flashed a BOOTSTUB update you need to restore the stock BOOTSTUB from GalliumOS then use the recovery media then reset the GBB flags if nonzero.If you flashed a Full ROM firmware then you need to restore the entire stock firmware either from a backup you made or using a generic recovery image firmware aka a shellball ROM then use  the recovery media then reset the GBB flags if nonzero.Fortunately for you my Firmware Utility Script will not only identify the type of firmware youre running but also provide all firmwarerelated functions needed to restore the stock firmware.

Signing something is another story but we havent been presented with that information. If a device breaks disappears and the child does not have access it is highly unlikely you would be able to fail them this all depends greatly on the school system and state. Ive worked in rather poor school systems and the requirements youre mentioning would simply never fly.

I only use Chromebooks because I need a full desktop browser I cant live with the IOS or Android browsers.Honestly Chromebooks are nowhere near to a premium tablet when it comes to allinone solutions. Even with Android coming to Chrome OS the devices are not really meant to use as a tablet they are heavy and often awkward to use. The touch screen experience at least on my Asus Flip is a far cry from my previous Tab S. Plus a lot of apps still not working well or at all in that matter... I know Google says it is in still Beta but I have the feeling that it will never be perfect and not because of Google but the app developers. They dont care enough they never had. Android users have phones mostly the laptop sized screen users are just a very small percentage so no one really cares if we are throwing a tantrum that we dont like how an app looks or behaves. Long story short I lost hope in this whole Play Store happiness. It would be much better if Google would the merge on the other way around giving desktop like features to Android. like the rumoured Andromeda OS would do it. Then at least Android tabs could be used as small desktop replacements. Whoever wantneed bigger screen than a tablet could opt for a proper laptop.,chromeos,d8xwv26,2,t5_2r1wh

Both Chrome and Android apps show up in that list. What I cant do is to read files on the SD or USB from within an Android app nor can I save files from an Android app to the SD or USB. The workaround for saving is the fact that the Downloads directory is shared by Chrome and Android. On my ASUS Flip GB I have about GB free so I just use that as a temporary repository for changed versions and then move them over to the SD when Im done.

Base model is  but you can pick it up for around  or so on sale usually.  Chat with the dell reps online and they might give you a deal.    The other option would be the Lenovo Chromebook  which has a pretty good lenovo keyboard but the trackpad isnt as nice as the dell.  You should be able to get one in the  range for the base model or higher if you want a FullHD screen.    In the  range there are less powerful but still nice devices like the Acer Chromebook  Usually .  And the Toshiba Chromebook  CB is  but the warranty leaves something to be desired and they keyboardtrackpad are not quite as nice as the Dell or Lenovo.    More importantly so long as shes near the internet for most uses she can write offline in GDocs shell love a chromebook over a comparably priced Windows machine.  Namely because they all have excellent trackpads just some like the Dells are insanely nice and decent keyboards.  Even a budget  chromebook is going to be decent for typing.

Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,chromeos,dds6z5f,1,t5_2r1wh

10924544,0,t3_5w1n5i,Im sure this will go against the majority but I am extremely disappointed with the Chromebook Plus. I just got mine in the mail today and it was a big let down. Ive been using an Acer C for the last couple years. The C felt cheap but it was to be expected given it was less than  bucks. The Chromebook Plus really did disappoint me. Its flimsy and feels really cheap. Little things bother me. Theres a lot of flex in the body and typing on the keyboard will wiggle the screen. The trackpad flexes under slight finger pressure. The display is so much heavier than the body that it throws the entire thing off balance. When I set it down on a flat surface only three of the rubber feet touch down and it wobbles. For damn near  dollars build quality like this is inexcusable.     Im not trying to talk you out of the CB Plus but make sure you have a chance to play with one in person before deciding.      edit on a positive note the display is beautiful.,chromeos,de6sgy1,2,t5_2r1wh

If you want a super nice screen and arent worried about sacrificing some battery life  hours instead of  then the HP G is REALLY nice Ive never seen a sale on those though.  At least with the Dell you can find them in the  range.  Giving them the most value.  At retail prices the Dell isnt that much better it was originally sold at .  The Thinkpad p version is nice if youre looking for a work machine great keyboard sturdy frame....reliable.  Again the sales of the nice versions of those are rare I saw the i sale on tiger direct once.  Its hard to find them other than the Lenovo website and even there they seem to be disappearing as many of the original options are gone.    If I were in the market today I use mine for business mostly my order of things Id try to buy would be the Dell CB the Thinkpad  the Samsung Chromebook Pro The Asus C then the HP G .

11170224,0,t3_5zg9r3,I had a similar experience.  I was out with some buddies one day doing normal stuff...drinking and bouncing from bar to bar.  Sometime in the afternoon an old man walked up to us and asked us if we had a laptop he could use.  A strange request but we did have a chromebook in my friend Steves bag.  Knowing that chromebooks are impervious to hacking and that there was little chance of him doing anything weird on it without us knowing we obliged.  We handed him the Acer R and allowed him to hop on the Starbucks wifi.  As we chatted and he browsed we wondered why he needed the laptop but we didnt want to be rude.  After a few minutes it became awkward and we began feeling a bit uncomfortable.  A few moments later he turned to us and asked us a question that would change our lives forever or for at least the rest of that day.  Do we want to go out on his boat?  We were pretty drunk and how could you resist such an offer on a hot day.  Sure! Lets go!  He closed the chromebook and handed it back to us.  Not thinking Steve jammed it in his backpack rather sloppily but its a chromebook and theyre cheap and it doesnt matter anyways.  About an hour later we finally found our way to the docks.  Of course we stopped at a few bars along the way.  By this time we had lost a friend who caught an uber home to pass out early what a lightweight.  Steve Billy and I followed this stranger wed only met a few hours earlier.  No one had asked his name but it didnt really matter.  We were on an adventure.  At the docks we found a large cabin cruiser tied up and the man motioned for us to follow him aboard.  About  minutes later we were making our way out of the marina and towards open water.  It was a perfect day to be on a boat.  We had brought a few roadies with us and drank those.  The stranger dipped below deck for a second once wed reached open water.  We bemused to each other how strange this whole day was but assured ourselves there was nothing to worry about.  He emerged a few moments later with a cooler full of beer.  This guy was alright!  He then began to tell us a story you wouldnt believe.  All about how he was maybe the most tragic person weve come across.  And to top it off he felt that we were the future him a mere relic of a bygone life.  He told us to not waste all our potential and to stop thinking so highly of ourselves as he used to of himself.  Feeling guilty Steve chimed in Im sorry man I didnt even catch your name.  I feel terrible.  He motioned to the backpack Well I should still be signed in thats a Chromebook isnt it.  And then he turned around and cast some reels into the ocean.  Steve sort of chuckled and reached for his bag.  Sure enough there it was and  hours later that chromebook was still chugging along.  His name....Mac.  Maybe the last of a dying breed.  And I couldnt help but think as we sat there trolling along...what a day.,chromeos,dey4sul,5,t5_2r1wh

11653971,0,t1_dggolgu,It depends on the type of development you do. For university  A CB will do fine. You usually arent building big apps and dont need a lot of memory or storage. Crouton is just to get by solution.  Most people that are using CBs for nonweb dev have just rooted and installed a full Linux distro. And really if Google cared enough they could close the backdoor that allows Crouton to work. There are a ton of Google teams that use CBs  but they use a special ChromeOS build with more capability. But the version the public has access isnt the same. It assumes an always connected environment. Android studio is only relevant for Android app development  which isnt bad just limited. Myself I could never fully develop with a CB. My memory needs are too high I often have to be disconnected from the Internet use languages that are esoteric and niche and need to VMs and containers. If youre a line developer CBs are probably fine. A cloud IDE would be fine because youre more or less a r always connected to Internet using well known languages and frameworks building for web and your boss wants all your work done in the cloud. This assumes youre going to be able to access any development VM or container remotely and more or less assumes youre building web or headless applications. Just hope a backhoe never severs your fiber... However despite ChromeOS supposed focus on security  theres little support for corp VPNs unless you count running an Android client which only secures Android app traffic. It just all about what you do. If you do photo video or real computer science  a CB is probably not the right choice. ,chromeos,dggzq60,0,t5_2r1wh
11657362,0,t1_dggv8eo,Wut? Cite some sources for that assertion.Chrome OS hardware is not offtheshelf stuff.

11701067,0,t1_dgm82dm,Ok. I am not sure the difference in boot screens as its seems to boot straight to my chrome os login screen. A shell does work from this though so it seems that you were right it was in dev mode already.  different blogstutorials I have been ready seem like they could better explain that.

11769844,0,t1_dgu205q,That is the way Im currently doing it but its pretty annoying so Im trying to get around it. Speaking of notifications to the watch how do you find notification dismis syncing between all of your devices? I have this Chromebook an Android wear watch and an Android smartphone. Even using Googles own apps the notification dismissing doesnt seem to work which results in having to dismiss the same notification on a bunch of devices. ,chromeos,dgu55kk,1,t5_2r1wh

I had to manually cancel my  monthly plan when I got a new chromebook and got the promotion. edit If you have more than gb of stuff when the promo ends youd likely have to change your subscription to the TB or you wouldnt be able to add any new files. ,chromeos,dgujwq9,2,t5_2r1wh

11792622,0,t1_dgwq485,gt Google Docs has an addon called Paperpile Sure but if youre doing serious academic work like OP its really a bad idea to relay on applications and workflow that arent supported by your campusdepartmentlibrary. We are an Endnote campus and students in my department often have K or more entries in their personal databases...which they can integrate seamlessly and quickly in Word via Cite While You Write. They can also get immediate assistance from reference librarians and IT staff with those applications. But if they decided to use Paperpile they would be entirely on their own fine for some but many of my students would argue its much better to go with whatever everyone else is using to avoid problems.Theres also the question of formatting and accuracy. For example can you direct export from OCLC or Ebsco databases into Paperpile? And if so will it correctly format references in the specific form you need? Ive tried a lot of these applications over the years and most of them generate errors with many popular databases due to background coding issues or other flukes...Id rather use the dominant application on campus so people can tell me Hey when you export from  youll need to correct info in two fields to generate correct Chicagostyle citations than to try to do things on my own and end up with a professor on my case because a comma is in the wrong place in a citation. Being that professor Ive had that experience many times...reading through a  citation bibliography and seeing the same errors repeatedly does not make a good impression.,chromeos,dgwqezr,2,t5_2r1wh
11792936,0,t1_dgwqezr,gt Sure but if youre doing serious academic work like OP its really a bad idea to rely on applications and workflow that arent supported by your campusdepartmentlibrary.I get that. And obviously in that scenario the predominate application that is commonly used by your peers would be the best option I was just pointing out that Google Docs offers means of generating citations as well.gtcan you direct export from OCLC or Ebsco databases into Paperpile? And if so will it correctly format references in the specific form you need?I dont have any experience with OCLC or Ebsco so I cant attest to whether it has that ability or its accuracy although its very easy for anyone who is curious to test that for themselves. I submitted a research paper for my  capstone course last week using a citations page generated by Paperpile and the Professor is quite the dick and not in the he doesnt make the course easy so hes a dick sense the guy is just a dick so I guess Ill find out whether there are any issues with it very soon.,chromeos,dgwrp3i,1,t5_2r1wh
11799089,0,t3_6876w1,For website design there are a bunch of online tools like Cloud Mockflow Webflow ShiftEdit and even Codepen.

11806624,0,t1_dgyauzk,The hinge is fine except in tablet mode there is no support in the middle of the screen on the hinge side so it feels flimsy since you can compress it while holding it and make that part of the screen white out.  It also sticks out further than the screen and feels like I could catch it on something and rip it off.  As a hinge it works great screen is stable etc. But in tablet mode they didnt do a very good job with the design.  I wonder if I can add a thin strip of rubber in the middle to brace the screen...I think im going to have to return this one since just moving the charger wire moves the usbc connector enough in the port to stop charging even though the plug is pushed in all the way.  If I push the plug in no actual movement occurs then it starts charging again until you move it.  I dont have anything else usbc to test it with so I dont know if its the device or the plug or both.  So far a lack luster experience with the hardware performance is great though.Also the edges of the screen are quite sharp where the two halves meet super uncomfortable to use.  Assuming these are actual issues aside from the first one and not present on every device then I would certainly recommend it to people great specs for the price and the keyboard is quite nice too.This article seems to imply they are real issues ,chromeos,dgybl2m,1,t5_2r1wh
