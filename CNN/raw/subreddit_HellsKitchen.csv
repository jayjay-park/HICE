1873621,0,t3_2btxz1,I have a few questions I just started watching. What happens to the customers in the restaurant when chef Ramsey kicks the whole team out of the kitchen? Do they just leave hungry? Why would anyone go there if there was a pretty good chance of not getting food? Also are these people paying for their meals? ,HellsKitchen,ckeyqkq,1,t5_2ti5x
1890264,0,t3_2g20uw,Something feels really off this season.Different announcer no JP again and is it just me or is the video quality worse this year? The camera on the signature dish challenge looked like a VGA Webcam.,HellsKitchen,ckgyvsr,1,t5_2ti5x

6455615,0,t1_czmwj08,I think Jen is my most disliked only because I remain convinced that Tannille and Raj were plants and kept because the producers made him keep them. Most of the crap Elise did was behind the scenes or away from his view so I can understand Ramseys skewed opinion of her. This is why I think they should have video highlights at the eliminations. That would be amazing. The NFL does it why not Hells Kitchen?,HellsKitchen,czn1xf8,1,t5_2ti5x

7164627,0,t1_d1sj50x,The question was more about your actual expectations. I wasnt trying to find out what happens if you dont get fed. It was more along the lines of would you bring a snack with you since you might be waiting up to  hours? Would you have a big snack ahead of time or would you just go hoping that you would be there on a good night and get fed?,HellsKitchen,d1sjson,4,t5_2ti5x

9186274,0,t1_d8g4hw9,Wasnt the prize back then more than just the executive chef position at an existing restaurant?  I think past rewards were about going into a brand new restaurant thus the redesign aspect mightve been more insightful.,HellsKitchen,d8gfe4b,3,t5_2ti5x
