6373543,0,t1_czbcqpv,I think it feels wrong because it was shoved into one breathless conversation instead of dripfed throughout a full season. It dove head first into this new thing and we never saw the slow discoveries and realizations like we did in the original series. That dripfeed method made it easier to believe that the conspiracies were actually happening because we were learning at the rate of Mulder and Scully. But the way it happened in episode  a flood of oh so this whole time...!! made it sound ridiculous. ,thexfiles,cze3o9p,3,t5_2s24b

Remember that she had to sequence Svetas whole genome to get a positive result.If this is it then it could just be a minor stroke of genius on Chris Carters part full genome sequencing didnt become feasible to be simply ordered by a doctor until pretty much last year when cost came down to around K.If thats what it takes to find the alien DNA it most definitely wasnt financially justifiable to perform this on an FBI agent around ish.,thexfiles,czfvwgb,2,t5_2s24b
