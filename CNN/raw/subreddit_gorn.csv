9841319,0,t1_daqcbzk,I didnt think so I dont know how you did the weapons but it seems to depend on some math since I can get an astronomically fast swing by emulating the angular momentum and bringing my top hand down to the bottom hand as I swing. I pictured something like going over a certain velocity causing the grip to release and having a timer if youre just holding them. Combined with haptics I could see that giving them a decent sense of weight and it would no doubt be exploitable but itd be harder to do than it is now. I dont know shit though I just dabble with coding and game engines so I could be suggesting heavyweight code for all I know. ,gorn,daqchvb,2,t5_2u6j4
