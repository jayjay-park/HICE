91185,0,t1_ceosr77,Im not trying to bust you up here honestly Im just trying to spark a little more discussion. For me I never really thought it was that bad not bad enough to swear off SpiderMan forever. Ive seen fictional characters make deals with the devil for a lot worse than saving the life of the woman who raised them and they also lost their soul in the process which is a lot worse Im assuming than forgetting your marriage and being mindwiped into thinking you just lived with your girlfriend for a few years. I mean look at Bedazzled I dont think in either version the main character comes off as evil in fact hes pretty damn likeable and a damn nice guy. I see Peters situation in much the same light.,Spiderman,ceot6rr,2,t5_2rw42
109968,0,t3_1v9iry,I believe those are still just memories kind of like a rom its not the real deal even though it functions the same people are speculating that the real Pete is the Green Goblin as he hasnt done anything bad in fact he has saved many people who wouldve been beaten within an inch of their life if not killed by Superior.,Spiderman,ceqyars,0,t5_2rw42
125411,0,t1_cesot6x,Thats true but again most of them were either done to stop writing about a married Peter Parker or to kill him off. . Pretty sure the organic webs thing was just to get the comic books to align with the films which was a dumb idea.. They killed the main character of the comic book. For most people Peter Parker is SpiderMan and they read SpiderMan as much for Peter Parker as they do for his alter ego. Killing him is of course going to be met with ticked off fans. If you killed Wolverine and replaced him with some other guy with claws would it still be Wolverine? Thats not to say that the stories werent well done but for a lot of people SpiderMan isnt SpiderMan without Peter Parker.. Im convinced the introduction of Ben Reilly as the true Peter Parker was the first attempt of many to get around Peter Parker being married to Mary Jane. They just didnt know how to write good stories for a married superhero and still dont seem to know how to do so. Which is a shame because comics like Saga seem to demonstrate that its possible to do so.. Parkers cyborg parents... I dont remember that plot line very well. Wasnt that at the tale end of the clone saga? Whatever the case its sort of silly.. SpiderMobile was probably created to sell toys and isnt an important point in Parkers life.. Radioactive semen is...dumb anyway you slice it.. Gwen and Norman having a secret affair is another dumb one since it jacks up a touchstone moment in the SpiderMan mythology. Its like messing with uncle Bens death. In my opinion its a sign of bad writing when you cant create a new mythology and seem forced to mess with the old one time and time again.. SpiderMan unmasked could have worked.. One More Day was the final attempt at breaking up Peter Parker and MJ for reasons stated above.. I havent read the Superior SpiderMan stuff yet but they killed Peter Parker off once again and replaced him with his archnemesis who doesnt act or sound anything at all like SpiderMan in the previous books. Growing up with the character Doc Ock was always supposed to be a fat mad scientist with a bad Roy Orbison haircut and a superiority complex. Knowing that this guy is in the agile and powerful body of his heroic nemesis just seems so bizarre to me. Hes the last person I could see doing this. Its an interesting concept if youre doing it for a few months and its already been done more than once best of all by Kraven but no PeterParker in the books for over a year seems to be really pushing it for fans.I dont know. It seems to me that the things that arent just a straight cash grab like the toy car and the movie web spinners is just Marvels attempt to break up Peter and MJ or to kill Peter altogether and I can see how that would piss fans off. Id argue that its not simply that these are major changes to the SpiderManParker character but theyre changes that for the most part were poorly handled. The Miles Morales and Superior SpiderMan story lines may go down in history as the best of the lot. The Ben Reilly and unmasking ones could have worked if done with better writing. They need to shake up the character but they need to do it with tact and in a way that will seem convincing finally kill off aunt May with old age for goodness sake.,Spiderman,cespo08,3,t5_2rw42
127268,0,t1_cestfps,Nothing wrong with a good Batman and Joker story in any sense. I just want my DC characters to stay out of my SpiderMan. The GG has a lot more character history and depth than the Joker does imo and there is no reason to bring the character down to a level that Slott is. I can admit that I may hold some bias and I may even be being GG too much credit but for a character that has shaped a good majority of the SpiderMan mythos please elevate him back to a mastermind rather than goblinizing people. Too much reminded of the Joker. shrugs,Spiderman,cesx9y9,3,t5_2rw42

195411,0,t3_1w7stm,Well first off there are many many more comics then . Thats just one series of Spiderman comics. Also Marvel does a sliding time scale. So Peter Parker was born in the ss now as opposed to the s. Seriously dont be anal about this. Just take it a decade at the time. Start with the s and move to the present. Then backtrack ss....Annuals? Look up a wiki because they came out at random times and may or may not be relevant to the story.

2221759,0,t1_clm4ien,I think thats the point. My only experience with the storyline was from an article so bear with me here. It was at first Peters fault. His identity as SpiderMan was the sole reason for his loved one being put in danger. Afterwards it could be said that it wasnt Peters fault at all. He gets an almost free pass and Gwen gets knocked down a peg for almost nothing. It would be like Inigo Montoya using his fathers death as a cover up reason for killing the murderer while in reality hes just having an affair with the murderers wife.

Regardless Otto is a genius he made tech to hide them from the inheritors and outfitted himself with  tech so they can actually stand a chance. He started gathering the spider army off the bat and if anything has made more progess then the other group. And yes he treated Kaine like crap but do you really even has to ask why?

Hes married MJ gets pregnant hes been a HS teacher and now works for Tony Stark and lives in avengers Tower. Hes like  years past what he is in ASM . At this point hes an established hero. Other Super heroes look up to him so he cant really be the kid who has to prove he can hang with avengers Thats what makes his unmasking such a big deal.

3100791,0,t1_cojdn3t,Not at all an irritation this is the kind of discussion I was hoping for!It may not be a writing style thing but I still think the outcast thing is a byproduct of being a nerd. Or its possible that my entire image of a nerd comes from early Peter Parker so its all mixed together in my mind. I read the first  issues or so right after the first SpiderMan movie came out so I would have been . I was definitely an outcast myself a bit so its easy to see how it all blends together. But no teenager I knew would go to a science exhibit. I dont know if that was a thing of the times or a tool to show that Peter really cared more about science than anything else. His dress was also a part of that classic nerd look  neat hair Glasses collared shirt vest tieThis is another instance of it could be a product of the times and thats how people dress but to me thats classic nerd outfit. And all of that has been reversed in particular the glasses and the hair that show hes more normal now and can fit in.I think the best way to show peoples opinions changing is going be a contrast between his first rescue at the start of a movie and the end of the final battle or it can be between movies as a way to show the passage of time. But I do see how it can be a challenge. As a final thought Outcast might be more relatable to the comicreading everyman than nerd but Im also under the impression that nerds read comics too. I think the two nerd and outcast are so strongly linked that there might not be a clear line between them.,Spiderman,coje95d,2,t5_2rw42

If it happens that he doesnt then we will be very disappointed but we will eventually move on and give the guy a chance.

Knowing that something isnt permanent has nothing to do with a creator spamming social media laughing at and antagonizing upset fans. There are plenty of examples of both Slott and Marvel as a company doing just that. I remember that year I was at the CE Spidey panel and Nick Lowe immediately started off with Who was upset with Peters death? tons of people raised their hand. To which he followed up with For everyone who wasnt upset get ready! You will be soon!gtdont expect them to just come out and say Just so you know guys Peter will be back someday.They didnt have to do that. Instead they could have advertised the story with excitement. Something like This story is full of twists and turns! Youll never guess whatll happen next! instead of the story famous for pissing of a legion of fans! Will this next twist piss you off too!? Lets hope so!gtThats what the whole event is about. Alt world heroes on the same world.Yes and no. The key word here is event. Not once here has Slott emphasized that this is directly connected to Secret Wars. Instead he exclusively talks about the marriage and how fans have wanted it for years. Lets also not forget that Slott is specifically known for completely ignoring events and other writers work. Heck just look at SpiderVerse. His own story. Right in there he ignored all the tie in books as there are tons of inconsistent plot points.gtike I said elsewhere this is a Marvel universe event not a SpiderMan event.Again Slott has a reputation for ignoring events entirely and doing his own thing.gtDoes a story have to be ongoing to be enjoyable?No. But dont advertise it as ongoing then. Be upfront and clear with your audience.gtAnd maybe if enough people prefer it over regular Spidey theyll do something else with the marriage.One can only hope. Ill be purchasing the issues as I favor the marriage myself. Ive always been of the belief that its best to speak with your wallet in situations like this. Support the stuff you enjoy dont waste money on stuff you dislike. When this story ends if I dont like the next story I wont be purchasing it.,Spiderman,crq2ipp,1,t5_2rw42

4132441,0,t3_2xl85z,I feel like this needs to be said because some newer fans seem to lack some knowledge on the history of Peter Parker mostly because of the bullshit DBS keeps spouting. People seriously need to quit acting like Marvel is going the Ultimate route. Casting young isnt a Ultimate idea alright? Peter Parker was  years old in the  universe. Everytime somebody says casting young is an Ultimate idea they just look like uneducated SpiderMan fans. Literally everybody who jumps to this conclusion is under twenty. Im under twenty and even I know the history of SpiderMan. If you guys which Im sure many of you have have been following Spidey comics in the last decade youll see a general consensus that the Ultimate line was great but it lacked the great villains of  Spidey. Many people quit reading because the villains just werent as interestingmenacing as their  counterparts. By the way the ENTIRE idea of watching Peter grow up and GROW into an Avenger is a strictly  idea. Realize that they will use elements from BOTH canons and other lesserknown ones. As for the Goblin idea I agree. In fact most Ultimatereaders agree that Miles is a more enjoyable character than Ultimate Peter but they also agree that  Peter is more enjoyable than both because hes got this certain charisma charm and history that neither can compete with.urealpunyparker Shut the fuck up. Once again I never said I hate Ultimate you fucking hypocrite. Its ridiculous to think theyll focus primarily on the Ultimate when nobody is asling for it. For fucks sake people dont even want a highschool Peter anymore they want college Peter. Stop acting like youre my father alright? You being older and still using reddit constantly as you are and obsessing over Dylan is creepy as hell.uRedgohan I am simply stating that a faithful Ultimate adaptation is out of the picture. Also planning doesnt matter his plan never came into fruition. Therefore it is strictly .

On top of that they flooded the market with variant covers and whatnot devaluing the comics already outThere are definitely exceptions to this but the s are also known for releasing some really bad storylines usually consisting of forcing legacy versions of characters. i.e. Ben Reilly Thunderstrike in Thor Vengeance in Ghost Rider Azrael in Batman Knightfall the FOUR Supermen that took over after the Death of Superman story ect and terrible art its when Rob Leifeldt was in his prime for example.

A black figure moves swiftly across the screen. We see it stop. It looks down. Some robbers are attempting to break into a shop. The figure leaps down and we see that its Daredevil. He quickly dispatches two of the robbers. Three more to go. A robber charges. Daredevil spin kicks him and the robber is sent flying backwards. He quickly wall runs and knocks out another robber with a swift kick. One left. He turns and charges at the robber. But before he can contact the robber is whisked away upward. Daredevil stops and looks up. The robber was being pulled up by a web. A figure is pulling him up.SpiderMan? Hows it going Daredevil? SpiderMan lands right next to him. What are you doing in Hells Kitchen? he asks. Oh you know the usual. Just stopping crime maybe picking up some donuts. SpiderMan replies. Arent you a kid? Isnt this a school night? And if it is? You plan on making me go to bed? No. Look I can handle the crime here my WATCH OUT! SpiderMan lunges at Daredevil and knocks him down as a shot is fired.

4406407,0,t3_3bhq5f,A Clone Saga video game is my dream. Me being a fan of this Era aside the Clone Saga narratively is long enough and has enough twists to carry a video game story better than any other medium. The mechanics would play with the Spider Sense early warning system based on a throwaway line from Maximum Clonage by Kaine suggesting Spider Sense cancels other Spider Senses out I dont agree with it in the books but it could work in a game. I also like the idea of some kind of journalistic detective work in game play that could reveal identities early give split story lines and endings or just reward exp upon correct deductions.

4717231,0,t1_ctot48j,I understand this. I grew up on the s animated series. Peter was an adult for all intents and purposes. I think he was in college but definitely acted more adult than most people Ive ever known in college. Then the Tobey movies came out while I was in high school. Sure he supposedly graduated high school during the movie but he was obviously an adult.And  Peter was a married adult when I was reading. One of the first issues I had was the end of the clone saga and dealt with Peter learning that his baby didnt make it whether it died or Norman kidnapped it whatever and Ben Reilly dying. So SpiderMan has always been an adult figure.I did read Ultimate SpiderMan in the early s so at that time we were around the same age. That was cool. And Ultimate SpiderMan is still one of the best SpiderMan stories out there except GwenCarnage crap.But now... now Im  and weve got stuff like the Ultimate SpiderMan cartoon show which clearly panders to young kids and Marvel editorial staff looking through their NostalgiaGlasses acting like high school Peter was best Peter. But maybe Ive matured and I just see the new younger Peter as a Peter for the next generation. Maybe there are some kids out there who never really paid attention to SpiderMan but they are nerdy teens who will see the new Peter and be like Hes like me! However I dont think the lessons of responsibility and Peters never lose hope attitude will be conveyed as much as I think it should be.TLDR Im old now and the new Peter is for a new generation of fans.

6113504,0,t1_cyki9tg,All I can do to this first comment is laugh. Saying that something is Christian simply because it is a product of the US is insane.I hate to break it to ya bub but when that line was written it was stolen from someone else. We dont know who first said that line because its so old. Its often attributed to early Romans or Greeks. Martyrdom is present in all cultures and is in no way almost exclusive to Christianity. It can be found in Chinese culture Sikhism and Hinduism among others. Martyrdom is a concept not owned by any single person or culture. Your next point here...Im not even sure if its a full thought. What do you mean its guiding actions toward people? Thats....not Christian. Its martyrdom and takes place in many cultures as I defined above. Its selflessness and its not owned by a single religion. Gender roles on the other hand are cultural something that has been shifting in the US in recent years. The traditional be a man and defenseless woman concept are dated and can be traced back to the United States Christian roots but thats not the point. The point is that Peter shouldve been considerate and take care of his family. And if you dare say that family is a strictly Christian thing prepare to lose all credibility. In your next point youre questioning the bakery basis of the character. Uncle Bens death was not destiny it was a result of choice. It shows that every choice we make has consequences and that Peters choice resulted in the death of his Uncle. Its not logical its consequential. It taught Peter that the choices he makes are important especially now that he has great power. With great power comes great responsibility.Humility is not a purely Christian ideal. That this story was written in the US and that the US can be considered Christian is largely coincidental. However that aspect is essentially only part of the movie and reflects the movie makers not the character. In the comics Peter often attempts revenge but it also often backfires. Im sure sayings similar to your quote exist in other cultures as well. Calling it preacher is applying a Christian theme to a common concept. Teaching lessons through stories is a thing of humanity in itself something weve been doing since weve been cognizant. You fail to see my point. Whether or not you can find Christian ideas is not the point the point is that you can identify with the character. Thus the ideas that define the character transcend a single sect. Theyre concepts that can be understood by all and are held by all because they are human not strictly Christian. ,Spiderman,cykjjeo,1,t5_2rw42

6443363,0,t3_43wqsp,TAS is disliked by me at least because of many reasons but Ill give you four because I havent seen it since it came out on Bluray and yes I saw it in Theaters. One Many people saw that Gwen Stacy was gonna die. I liked HOW she died in the film but many Spiderfans saw it coming a mile away. Two Electro was bland and one dimensional. His depth is like that of a golf hole in that it is not that deep. haha. He hates Spiderman? Ok. But what after he kills Spiderman? Nothing... because he has no real goals and so he is not thought of as a real person. I could go on about the lack of substance of Jamie Foxxs terrible terrible character but lets get to the third reason. Three Terribly predictable scripting. Why didnt Spiderman give his blood to Harry? Because it could kill Harry. But Harry was gonna die anyway! Everyone I know sided with Harry on this argument because Peters reason for not sharing his blood made absolutely no sense. The goblin was henceforth predictable. Four Peter recovers from the grief of Gwens death not just  minutes after she died in the movie. I know the film shows Peter grieving for months on end but were never walked through the process. We get distanced from our hero. Thus everything felt awkward and forced when he came back at the end of the film to fight the Rhino.,Spiderman,czls7o9,5,t5_2rw42

In comics you can scifi away the impossibly flat webbing cartridges and shooter and the protruding aperture and I guess a retractablefoldup palmtrigger to hide it.

8646454,0,t1_d6ls0i6,While I dont agree with you on many of your points its really refreshing to see a alternate noncirclejerky look at the Marvel movies. I agree that Amazing SpiderMan  gets too much hate. But its still a mixed bag of extremes for me. TSome parts blew me away like Gwens death and the opening scenewhich to this day is the most SpiderMany scene ever to be put on screen. Other things made me physically cringe. Youre a fraud SpiderMan! And I just hated everything about the Goblin story. None of it jived for me. It just seemed like they were trying way to hard to differentiate him from the Raimi Goblin which nailed it. I get why they did it I just didnt like it. Also I was pissed when I heard Electroone of my least favorite villains was going to be the main villain and was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked him.I love the MCU. Civil War is my favorite movie of all time. But I do agree that Phase specifically Thor TDW CA AoU and AntMansuffered from an excess of genericism. And I say that as somebody who LOVED Winter Soldier. Marvel Studios has begun to be that guy at the party who everybody likes but only because hes a people pleaser and tells everybody what they want to hear.I would love to see marvel really push for experimentation and risk taking in the future even if it doesnt always turn out well. At the very least it will add more flavor to the universe. Thats why Im super excited for Thor Ragnorak. The logo makes it look like were going to be getting a sort of s Viking Metal style movie.

Around the time Social Network came out he was riding around LA on a moped whereas other people at that stage in their careers would probably drive around in a much nicer car. He also stopped by that playground in New York to play basketball with some kids and he backs a few charities in South America and Africa I cant remember their names but they play at the start of the Amazing SpiderMan DVDs. The only time Ive really seen him being portrayed in a negative light was when paparazzi were swarming Emma Stone and his car and he was just trying to drive away and not run anyone over so he got out and started yelling at them. But they were also being terribly invasive and would jump in front of the car when it started moving so I get that.

It DID add quite a bit to the mythos and it did spin the norms on their heads. But despite making questionable character choices I loved it. Then again after reading One More Day AND then Brand New Day almost entirely. I enjoyed that transition and change too. Would I rather Gwen NOT have sex with Norman? Yes. As much as I would rather Spidey be married forever but the way Marvel did it was interesting and added character depth. The Twins were a nice touch too wish they werent hated and then written out of continuity. ,Spiderman,da73p8l,1,t5_2rw42
9691355,0,t1_da6tzj1,Someone explained it like this. TASM felt like several episodes of a tv series that were made into a movie.Harry and Norman werent after thoughts but they made Electro one. So they made this huge dangling thread.Now the love story was the problem. Spiderman isnt one. Their approach to it made it needlessly complicated. Their breakup was pointless. His stalker vibe was distressing. But the death was handled just fine. Now Peters dad and Oscorp was a serious misfire. The plot line was went nowhere fast and answered nothing. The fact that they even filmed that alternate ending showed they had no idea what they were doing. ,Spiderman,da7nycr,6,t5_2rw42

I also feel the Amazing movies were both good. I absolutely think Amazing  is the peak of live action SpiderMan and while I am more than willing to be wrong nothing in Homecoming so far seems to be changing my mind.
