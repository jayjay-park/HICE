304555,0,t3_1xk01r,Buy one.I live in Alaska and have cooked in  degree weather.  Both steaks at  degrees and brisket at  degrees.As for cooking in the rain when I lived in Texas and there would be pouring rain during my long cooks I bought a chimney cap at Home Depot that I just set over the daisy wheel top.  It allows airflow while keeping rain from falling down through the gaps.Bricks?  No bricks.  Lump charcoal always.  If I fill up the firebox I can do a  hour cook at low temperature and still have unburned lump left when Im done.I switched from propane to my BGE almost  years ago medium for  years then added a large.  I seldom use the medium anymore unless Im cooking so much I need both.  Ill never go back.It can take a little while to heat up but I usually just light the egg as the first step in getting ready for dinner and its ready when I am.,biggreenegg,cfcc1qb,2,t5_2s3tb

402666,0,t1_cfmdwtw,I still use apple juice in the pan for ribs.  I have gotten away from using it in the pan with butts because I spray the pulled pork with apple juice afterward.  Give it a try with a little of your favorite rub sprinkled on I also tried mixing the rub in with apple juice in the sprayer.  Instant CLOG haha.  To me its a better use of seasoning than trying to go really heavy on the outside of the butt.,biggreenegg,cfmi3fe,1,t5_2s3tb

This Christmas he gave us a Looftlighter this ceramic Swedish lighter that looks like a bigbarrel curling iron and uses superheated air to light the charcoal quickly. It scared the shit out of me at first because it shoots out  degree air but its actually great and not that terrifying at all. We get our Egg going in about  the time it used to take. Works great on our firepit too. ,biggreenegg,chny8zg,1,t5_2s3tb

1223247,0,t3_2844u8,Its a  hour project... but with little work.Prepbrine ingredients liters of water cup brown sugar cup salt dont use salt shaker stuff use kosher or sea salt.  I used sea salt and it wasnt really  salty as some people warnedTo doMix it together until saltsugar is dissolved.  Then use a plasticglass tupperware type thing and place in fridge overnight.  I did mine for about  hours.Wait timeBefore you start to smoke remove from brine solution rinse off and tap dry with paper towel.  Theres a thing about letting it rest at certain temps and air circulation... I left mine in the fridge for  hours and was not upset about it.  To get air circulation at  degrees F or whatever just isnt going to happen unless it is springfall.  I will try it in the fall but suspect it is a nice to have as opposed to a necessity.CookingF for  hours.  Indirectish cooking.  In the sense that I used a splash pan to cover the coals from any drippings.I did this with a couple of soaked hickory woodchip bundles wrapped in aluminum foil with plenty of holes poked in them with also a handfull of chips thrown in over the coals.  I use the generic aluminum disposable pans you can buy at the supermarket.... and bend to fit.  Unless of course GF has made quiche in those prefab crust trays and I steal those when she is done ServedCut up a baguette into  inch slices.  Sweet Onion into  inch or so pieces.  Cream cheese and capers.  Take bread spread creamcheese add salmon and onionscapers to taste.  Could easily substitute bread with crackers.Thoughts on this cookThe large piece in the photo was amazing.  The smaller pieces thinner filets were over done to me... tasty but dry and overcooked imo so should have removed at maybe  min.  GF thought the smaller pieces were tastier but I guess it is personal preference thing.  Honestly the large piece had a very limited lifespan and was nowhere to be found after  minutes.  Thoughts to improve on this are welcome.  Was my first kick at the cat for hot smoking salmon and Im looking forward to giving it another whirl.  I got the method from googling various smoked salmon recipes and sort of combining some and removing some of the complications that didnt make much sense.,biggreenegg,ci78f8q,3,t5_2s3tb

I guess my main concern is that after filling close to the top i barely got  hours of cook time.  What do i need to do to get to that hr or higher range?

7147034,0,t3_4df25q, If you think smoke is the problem stick with plain hardwood lump charcoal with no wood chunks at all.  Or get the large kind and soak them for a day first and use less than .  Maybe youre using chips.  In any event once the lump charcoal is going it hardly smokes at all.  Foil it for the last  hours maybe.  Try that.  It needs exposure to dry heat for quite a while for all the bits and pieces to work so foiling it after the first hour  i mean why not just use your oven.What they probably do is shred their pork after the smoke and put it in some sort of container with some vinegar and spices and return it back to the smoker waiting for people to buy it.Go get a sacrificial pork butt and try am  stabilize at F am  Insert pork naked pretty much.  Maybe some salt. pm  Foil pork  pm  shred pork.  return it to your foil container which has been fashioned into a spiffy bowl. pm  Put in like a cup of apple cider vinegar salt pepper maybe some cayanne.  maybe some brown sugar.  maybe some montreal seasoning.  Wrap it all back up pm  Extract and sandwich it. You will never reach the quality of even gas station Austin BBQ but this gets you in the neighborhood at least.,biggreenegg,d1qjkui,2,t5_2s3tb
