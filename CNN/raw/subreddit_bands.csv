2691119,0,t3_2lt69o,I like the name and the logo is a great starting point! But  if you dont mind some constructive criticism I think you could take it further.Maybe a different font and look at ways to integrate the text and the actual finbullets a little more? as it stands they look just a bit separate.Im wondering could you make a fin shape out of two S letters? Anyway Im going to check out your music now. ,bands,cn9ukey,1,t5_2rac2
