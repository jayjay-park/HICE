You should be grateful that the skills that they are pushing you to learn are in such high demand right now.

A lot of times jobs within IBM are filled outside the bounds of the Global Opportunities database and app.   My last two jobs within IBM were gotten through good old fashioned networking.

6425486,0,t3_43n8j0,I think IBM does itself a disservice in its marketing exactly for the reasons you state.  They take a  person company and try to simplify it in to a few buzzwords like Cognitive Solutions Cloud Platform Company.  So when you pull back the curtain and its really a small part of the IBM business it looks bad.  Its the direction the company is going but not where it is at.  Maybe itll get there in one piece maybe not.  But at the moment  of the company does not fit in to those strategic imperatives and I bet that remaining  is a bit inflated by putting everything in that category that can possibly be justified to fit.For example Watson Analytics.  Sounds like Watson right?  Wrong.  Its a different analytics package that does basic statistical analysis.  Correlations linear fits etc.  If you started using Watson Analytics thinking you were getting Watson youd be severely disappointed.  Im not even saying that its a bad product but its just different than Watson.  All that negativity aside data analysis is still big.  But its a huge category and is mostly comprised of industryspecific things.  E.g. reading streaming sensor data on industrial systems to determine when they are malfunctioning is very different from analyzing social media and GPS data to know when consumers are buying or talking about a particular consumer product.  Or to take one from a commercial that may get more play again soon an electric utility combining weather data truck locations tree trimming history etc to determine where and when outages are likely to occur.Those examples rely on the aggregation and analysis of data in ways that used to not be readily available at least inexpensively but arent Watson or cognitive.  Yet they have big value to those industries.,IBM,czjxkqd,2,t5_2sgr6

I used netstat to find the IP it connects to then added a route to the IP routing table that goes nowhere  now I can login in Offline mode use it for my own tracking and it cant sync to the mothership.

7457441,0,t3_4h4lxe,The advice to look around is great.  While I think IBM is a great spot to learn PM the reality is hiring takes a long time and a multitude of things can happen to the position put on hold cancelled etc.Generally it takes about  months in my experience to go through the process and a month or so to get the paperwork and backend done.  This is why you should be applying elsewhere you may find something sooner that can lock you in.Otherwise know that there isnt really anything you can do to influence IBM at this point you need to let the process move forward.

7659307,0,t1_d3c6phk,Not at all true. Open up the job postings page and look at whats available. You can change jobs and even change careers within IBM and because youre already in you have the benefit of being able to ask around and do internal searches before applying. Some teams are spread out all across the country or even the world. Others are  inoffice because their job requires it or because it just works out better that way.

7711104,0,t1_d3dm4tf,This. You wont get promoted just for doing your job. You wont even get a raise other than TCM or whatever a COLA is called for doing your job. Promotions arent given as rewards you get promoted by taking on a new job with greater responsibility than before. How you get that job? It may be that someone leaves and you get promoted into it but that usually just means one fewer RA that has to take place before the end of the quarter and theyll reorg till the cows come home to avoid backfilling a position. So get a couple of  ratings in a row and hit a homerun in addition to doing your job. For these purposes a homerun is some project or program you created or significantly managed that ends up in your rdline managers own PBC results for the year.

8132008,0,t3_4qd42a,The good news about cascades is the budget is a different one from the usual offcycle budget.
