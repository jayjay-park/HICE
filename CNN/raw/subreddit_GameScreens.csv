9350993,0,t1_d913ktt,Yeah the story of HR is pretty nonsensical but the gun gameplay is top notch. Really set the bar for them to get it right with Shadow Warrior.And just the other day I bought the newer HR version on Steam for  bucks and got two versions of it Extended and Redux but I dont think thats supposed to happen. Like when a remastered version of a game is released and if you have the original you get the remaster happened to me with Darksiders  and Bioshock but I was buying the remaster already. Weird.,GameScreens,d91b12r,1,t5_2yxqi
