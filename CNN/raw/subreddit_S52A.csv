On the subject of that one time pad message I sent you here is the basis of what it says I find it a bit fishy that one of the people from r sent you a reply I think you may be in with them or know the person behind NODEQG. Why else would heshe respond to you? And why did you reply back? Its like you know what heshe is saying? I leave that theory up to other people. And Im not saying you are definitely in with them Im saying you might there are some strong black flags here. EDIT I did a background check on our little friend NODEQG he only had  things he made both comments one posted to some thing in movies the other one was made out to you fishy that he seemed to only talk to you Im digging around a bit to see who that other comment was directed at. ,S52A,cx6gp51,1,t5_3a3ms
