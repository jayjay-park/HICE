5236794,0,t3_3mpux4,So I watched MTV Scream this summer and I am very excited about watching Scream Queens. With that out of the way let me say that they are both very different style of shows. Scream while giving cheeky nods to the view was very much a show that took itself seriously. The tone of the show was dark the kills were intense and some scenes were downright claustrophobic. In contrast Scream Queens is not taking itself seriously at all. It employs bright colours and kills that are more humorous than suspenseful. Both shows are very enjoyable in my opinion but they both bring something different to the table.It depends on your personal preference. But if I could make a suggestion if you havent seen Harpers Island I would recommend checking that out if you can. Its a show that was done by some of the same showrunners that did Scream and was a  episode serialized whodunnit with at least a death an episode. ,ScreamQueensTV,cvh82ar,4,t5_361a8

5620514,0,t3_3s1c7n,Im sure there will be feminists who say that its sexist if both Red Devils are male and theyll also say that if both are female because theyll say it sends some sort of message that only women can be evil. Feminism has been hijacked by perpetually offended morons who grasp at straws to say that everything is sexist.But to answer your question I dont think this show is sexist or antifeminist in anyway and I think whoever ends up being the  Red Devils will be the people the writers felt made the most sense for the story they were trying to tell regardless of what their genders happen to be. At this point I think its most likely that there will be one male and one female Red Devil because I think Boone and Gigi are the most likely candidates to be the Red Devils.,ScreamQueensTV,cwts1f2,14,t5_361a8
5621076,1,t1_cwts1f2,Thanks for your reply I agree with literally everything youve said. Just to add I think when the episode airs that reveals who the Red Devil is all we want is a good story and it probably wont matter to many whether the killers are male or female. But I do think it will affect how much we enjoy the show later when we rewatch it and no longer see the RD but picture the person wearing the costume  Grace or Chanel on the lawnmower would be funny but Wes or Pete?

5780274,0,t3_3u5q8h,I cant remember the quote anymore but Mandy said something about the sisters who were there the night of the bathtub babies along the lines that she hid out one of the girls turned into an alcoholic one of the girls went to the insane asylum and one of them became a news anchor. Everyone assumes that Gigi was the crazy one and that Chanels mom was the news anchor but Ive been thinking for the past few weeks that with the sketchy way Wes has been acting whenever the topic comes up that its possible that Graces mom was the one who ended up institutionalized and that shes not dead at all just locked in the attic so to speak. I think he set the house fire as a way to explain why Graces mom just disappeared from her life.
