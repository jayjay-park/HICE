I see it as them moving to end the season as it is reaching its end so I think that barely introducing a love interest at this point  would be dumb or solidifying one would seem like a reasonable thing to do. I mean lots of one sided love thingies soooooo I think that the group will come to terms or do a samurai champloo ending thing.
