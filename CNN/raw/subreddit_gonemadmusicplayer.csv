10113441,0,t1_dbp255r,Yeah everybody wants free apps people dont realize how much time and effort it takes to make them. Its one of the reasons quality apps are so hard to find on Android. And also why were swarmed with ads... I buy all apps in which I see potential to support the dev but still use AdAway because its impossible to go completely Adfree I like that you went the trial  unlocker way and have no ads whatsoever even though Im wondering if you might have gained popularity faster with adsupported version  at least it seems to me it works better with the mainstream But Im sure youll get there just keep it up its pretty awesome already! Ill look into tasker eventually havent tried it yet I rather keep things simple if possible. Thanks.,gonemadmusicplayer,dbpsgkh,1,t5_2x46p
