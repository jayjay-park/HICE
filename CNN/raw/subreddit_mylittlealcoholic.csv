517763,0,t1_cfyqoh0,Last weeks episode was advancedterrible. Many people self included see it as the worst MLP episode to date. This weeks episode was just really bad. I dont get this thing where they make a character uncharacteristically terrible just so they can force the plot. I get that its cartoon hyperbole its just really annoying. ,mylittlealcoholic,cfz4ggv,1,t5_2tfik
