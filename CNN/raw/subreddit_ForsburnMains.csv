I saw you have a big amount of entries so have fun!,ForsburnMains,cvecr7k,1,t5_3a1t4

Without in depth description of those playstyles I dont believe that those individual playstyles exist there is not enough proof.Other than that its a pretty decent guide. Repeating a lot of the same things but I havent made a guide yet so I cant judge tooo much,ForsburnMains,cvej5sw,1,t5_3a1t4
