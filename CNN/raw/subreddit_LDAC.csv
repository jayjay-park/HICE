1158073,0,t3_26nwoc,You will be a cadet instructor at LTC. That means that you will fill a position as a squad leader or platoon sergeant in a platoon of cadets attending LTC. It is a great opportunity as you will be responsible to get cadets to training on time and in the right uniform. You will be introducing many of these cadets to Army concepts that they have never seen. It will really get you straight on all of the basics because you will be going over them every day. Im MS cadre and we assigned this job to our LDAC bound juniors who were late contracts as it will force them into leadership positions and facilitate a catchup to their peers who have been contracted much longer.,LDAC,chzwflq,1,t5_2w4eq
