152790,0,t3_1vs2w7,What people need to understand about INTP and ENTP is that the E in ENTP doesnt mean we enjoy hanging out with people and gain energy from our interactions. Extroverted Intuition our dominant function is the least peopleoriented of all of the extroverted functions and has much more to do with the way that we create and express thoughts.An INTP would just like you said find a random wiki page and follow one link after the other. They take things into themselves and create systems patterns models and mountains of fluff. An ENTP however would generate these things inside of himself and burst them outwards in writing thinking discussing and so on.Think of it this waySherlock Holmes and Iron Man both as portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. are typical examples of ENTP. Theyve got a lot going on inside their heads and have a compulsion to get it out of their head. That might happen in a lab in a series of essays in discussion or in a physical task of some sort. Its not necessarily a social extroversion as you can see in both cases.Dr. Gregory House and Data from Star Trek are better examples of fictional INTP. These are characters that take in a whole lot of information from their surroundings and have a compulsive need to master it  often for no reason than to just be better better than they used to be better than other people better than some ideal in their head.Your description of yourself sounds a lot more like INTP than ENTP. Your need to master and understand things is very typical to INTP. Your lack of organization probably just means that your Ti doesnt work that way at the moment but probably could if you trained yourself. Think about it youre already diving your writing in this post into comfortable paragraphs have an informative TLDR at the end some italics to separate the TLDR and even describe the same thing in two or three different ways as if youre unhappy with how you sorted the information the first time around.,entp,cevu1ki,3,t5_2qoy3

1250997,0,t3_28f8k9,Ask and learn EDIT While I definitely fall into this trap I will say that Im too distractedI procrastinate too much is nothing more than an excuse. Oddly enough ENTPs seem to be afraid of failure at times perhaps a product of inferior Si? but now Im just speculating. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Ti is the servant auxiliary of Ne and our tertiary function is Fe which is also extroverted. Thus our first three functions end up being pointed outward objectively since Ti is being fed information from Ne. With such outward focus young ENTPs seem to define themselves in relation to the knowledge they have gainedrecognizing their powers that others dont have. However the ENTP subconsciously realizes that this ability isnt infinite and has its limits or starts to burn out when they arent applying what they are learning to anything meaningful. Thus they start to become distracted and procrastinate. This outward focus may be one reason why ENTPs actually find it hard to define themselvesunderstand how they are feeling and why we have and need to develop inferior Si in order to provide a stronger subjective sense of self. You are right that there is a limited time however while you can still argue that specialization is for insects you do have to specialize in a certain amount of areas only  that is just economics. And fantastic bull shitting only gets you so far in the end depends on where how and why you are using it  need more details before I can actually say anything of value on this.I myself tend to study computer scienceeconomics pursuing those for college degree psychology theology and philosophy.

They just do it with words most of the time.  I thought I was an ENFP for a long time because Im quite squishy really.. but I only have positive squishy feels.

So when they compliment how someone reflects their values it sounds really badass and well thought out. It could catch you off guard. I think an ENFP will be more likely to call it like they see it which is how ENTP types can be as well. Thus they are still admiring how you reflect their values but it might not seem as serious or as well thought out.Loved the ENTJ vs INTJ simple example btw so true,entp,cl6hcfn,2,t5_2qoy3

In fact I think it mightve been to you though I cant say so with a hundred percent certainty of course.Not doing it to be a dick but rather to prod people to post something more interesting than just stating the obvious next time doing that is not particularly difficult just involves thinking up a question that goes beyond has anyone else experienced this very common ENTP thing as well?.Also just because this sub has relatively few posts which I dont think is that true overall its a fairly active sub more often than not with more interesting threads does not mean one should just make posts that serve no interesting purpose for the sake of it. Making it interesting is not difficult so please try at least.gt Not everyone values intelligence to the same degree sexually or otherwise.

Pretty obvious dont you think?gtI dont meet many people whose intelligence truly surprises and impresses me.

Im  now and have always been a late bloomer so its really been this year that has been different.  But Im not sure this is really the answer you need or are looking for.  What really got me to do the boring things about life was an epiphany.  I love games.  I love efficiency.  Why not make the boring stuff into a game?  Make every thing in my life efficient and see how well I can do at it.  Need to organize my desk?  Make that bitch your real life tetris.  Gotta get the dishes done?  Can I beat my previous time?

Fuck the gas company they cant challenge me with a piece of paper and win!It took awhile to change my brain chemistry to think like this but its been working more and more every day.

Like youre a junkie or something inflicting yourself on others and perhaps in a sense we are in this regard.ENTPs love teaching its just that with non NTs we have to explain things more carefully and overcome for lack of a better term intellectual resistance to the truths we are attempting to convey. In INTJ terms We have to dumb it down for the stupid types.In recent years Ive sort of made it my personal mission to identify and pull other NTs into my social circle. Since then I find myself needing to explain things less and less and its so freeing.Dont get me wrong an ENFJ will make you feel so loved and will help balance you out but at a cost. Theyre great for a while but their high error rates become grating over time. That said theyre great friends to have. As friends you dont need to keep them as far at arms length as an ENFP.

But Ne can also get that from hanging out on Reddit or reading Wikipedia. This is why ENTPs are called the most introverted extrovertsIf you find that sitting in you room makes you bored and you just want to get out to a party bar talk to people etc youre likely an ESTP which can appear very similar to ENTPs.

3375048,0,t3_2yu6o6,I say this a lot but youll find as you grow older that your happiness wellbeing and destiny are completely locked in with the rest of humanity. Sure there are super hermits out there but if youre anywhere near the middle of the bell curve youre going to need to cultivate a healthy sense of yourself in relation to others. Were not exceptions we all have to deal in our own ways with the absurdism of life its lack of inherent meaning.   ampnbsp I definitely relate and my advice is to cultivate a real genuine interest in other people. We arent typically interested in people like ENFPs are but we should be interested in the novel ideas and mutual cooperation that two people can bring to the table. And as an extrovert you should seek that. If those people dont exist in your life go find them. Personality typology gives you a start now its up to you to start applying and refinining it against your own life.  ampnbsp Realize that with  billion people in the world there are a lot of people way better than you many of them in all dimensions even the ones you hold most dear. When people talk to you REALLY listen and dont think about what you want to say next or what ideas start coming up. Live in the present learn to tame your Ne. Treat working on this just like anyone of the other obsessions we tend to take on. You should start developing a healthier sense of people as a whole why they are the way they are and your place in it. Youll have moments that click where so and so is a lot smarter than you thought they were they just might not be prone to expressing it as easily as often or as well. ampnbsp If you truly feel above others then use that altruistically everyone has suffering they want to alleviate you can help that not as some messiah but as someone who soothes suffering and bolsters talents. Its often said we work well in the abstract and within complex systems. Well theres not more complex system then all of humanity and the human condition! ampnbsp Last note. I know what its like to not be able to relate to other people and use your full stack of functions. Dont be disheartened knowing that there are others other there like this subreddit helps so much  it did for me. EI it doesnt matter humans are social creatures. Dont cut and run thats the easy way out and while it feels good in the shortterm almost vindicative youre only hurting yourself.

I would do anything you say and Id love it.can be summed up to Ive fallen in love but Im afraid to say it. Thats why he tried to downplay it when he said it explicitly.I think youre moving in the right direction due to Wittys advice. Some additional points Id like you to turn your attention to watch your reactions to his emotionality. You said you wanted him to tell you his feelings again when sober and you also implied you were coolheaded. Theres a difference between a questioning look and a Do you mean that? Lets talk about it when youre sober. and a hug in combination with Hey. Thank you. I do feel similarly to you but its all a bit confusing right now and I want to make sure you mean it. Id appreciate if we could talk about that once youre sober. Make sure you always encourage him to be honest and emotional. You might also need to put your ego and feelings out there for the first time  and what you perceive as putting them out there might not always be enough. he probably bottled up his feelings for years and it may take time to get over that. Both of you might get hurt in the process but Im sure it will be worth it. Definitely definitely definitely do not try to stay just friends. Thats not to say that you shouldnt be friends. But right now youre in a kind of limbo  an ambiguous state between friendship and realtionship. You two seem to be too close to be friends but afraid of taking the next step. But when you decided to stay friends you actually decided to stay in said limbo state. And thats a hurtful one and a decision that can prevent you from pursuing other romantic interests. Im actually relieved that you decided to take the step. Whatever you do get rid of the ambiguity. This may mean that youll have to take a step back and not see each other for a while although that may seem hurtful. After this you might or might not become friends again. You said you were afraid of losing your friendship. You have already lost it. As I said your friendship has been replaced by ambiguity. Replace it by clarity  this can mean looking how far your feelings go initiating a cooldown period or cutting contact altogether. Whatever may come of it take it as life experience.

To make it work between two types that are so different and at the same time both so proud and so emotionally skittish both parties have to expand their comfort zone and become comfortable with being MORE vulnerable than they feel is warranted given the other persons behavior.

Politics and project planning are mine elections specifically.The challenge you will have as an ENTP is focus.  ENTPs also value competency and if you cannot be competent in a field its going to be very dissatisfying very fast.  I would suggest that you should look into what you actually like first and then begin gathering the competencies and skill training in those areas  become an expert at the things you actually can focus long term on.

I dont believe the one for me so if there is someone it would be someone I choose. I dont keep note of all the bad things or at least I dont try to. It is more about can this person keep up with me and change and be open to new things like me. I think that has something to do with the intensity he is talking about. When I love someone I use my ENTP idea generatinggathering brain to find all sorts of ways to spoil and connect with that person. Most people cant handle it or dont think that they deserve it. I hate trying to convince people that it isnt about deserving it it is about what I want to give to the relationship.

But if you want to see how freeflowing systems work take a look at biological organisms.  Each cell in an organism naturally wants to do something different and fills a niche role in the system as a whole and each one is supported in doing what it loves which is why the system works so well.The incentive do something useful and different is genetic.And the jobs that humans dont want to do get filled by nonhumans plants for instance make oxygen for us animals to breathe.  Any time there is a new necessary job that opens up someone somewhere is likely to be curious about filling it.  And with humans being naturally creative and clever we have an even better way to get lame jobs done which is to innovate and find ways to get them done in the least boring and most exciting way.

3858257,0,t1_cqvkj17,gt The JP dichotomy for example just refers to ones preference for interacting with the external world with either NS or TF.Thats not really what that leveldimension is in the MBTI system.  JP is indeed how one interacts with the world technically all of reality as a whole but it is independent of the rest of the dimensions and appears to be governed by estrogen which is something that Helen Fisher a researcher working on personality and neurochemistry has been working on.  Big picture thinkers have more estrogen in their brain probably the prefrontal cortex specifically and are what MBTI calls Perceivers while more detail oriented thinkers are the Judging types and they have low levels of estrogen in the brain.  This is entirely unrelated to the other brain regions and neurochemistry third person FT is governed by testosterone in the neocortex and maybe earlier part of the prefrontal cortex second person SN is probably governed by serotonin in the limbic system and first person IE is governed by dopamine in the motor cortex.  Certainly when you have different combinations of categories in each dimension you get different types but these dimensions are absolutely independent from one another which is why you can get all  types.  I think the reason that some folks have a problem understanding how the fourth dimension of JP works is because this element of personality doesnt really even start to come into effect until the s in humans and so much psychology research is done for convenience sake on college students.   They dont have the full Perceiving effect at all so its impossible to see what it really is at that brain age.  Heck even those at age  dont have the complete development of the fourth dimension of awareness so what we call Perceiving is just a small bit of what it really could be in our level of complexity of consciousness.Rephrasing your theories into normal MBTI Having a J means you are a Judger using all that you already know about the universe in detail What does the universe want? to interact with the world. So Js like to have everything thought out and decided and feel uncomfortable when things are left open and hanging or when they cant decide.Having a P means you are a Perceiver using an open mind and big picture thinking and curiosity about what the universe seems to be doing What does the universe want? to interact with the world. So Ps tend to be more open and spontaneous and dislike having to make decisions because that closes off options. They get uncomfortable when theyre forced into making a decision.The crucial difference here is that we use all three of our other elements not just the middle two as we interact with the world on this philosophicalspiritualuniversal fourth dimension.  An ISFJ would use the Introverted physical element plus the Sensing emotional element and the Feeling intellectual element as well as their Judging philosophical element and an ISFP would be exactly the same except for the philosophical element.  Changing the last dimension doesnt really affect the first three dimensions.  An Introvert focused primarily on thinking What do I want? is physically going to always be an introvert no matter what the other elements are in the other three dimensions.gt Since we all see the world through perceptive filters even Nedoms we are always limited by our own understanding and experience. We cant incorporate things outside our scope or understanding as humans. Yes we have to incorporate other perspectives if we are ever to be social empathy intelligent objective thinking or philosophical understanding how whole cultures can change over time.  Yes obviously when we incorporate those external dimensions they are filtered through our own brain but theres a huge difference in how a mature human brian thinks  with all four dimensions of time and space available for mapping ideas  and the brain of a worm which has at most  dimension of thinking pretty much Yes I like this. and No I dont like this.   Humans start out life in the womb pretty similar to the worm in the complexity of thinking and slowly our brain grows and takes in more and more external information so as to better model reality in all  dimensions that were able to be aware of... so far.  That external information we incorporate into our thinking is other individuals perspectives.gt Most INTPs I know dont even realize they have body since they never seem to take good care of themselves lol. Again remember that with an I you often never know what they are thinking because they are internally focused.  They share their internal thoughts only in relation to their other dimensions.  So an ISTJ as you point out with their S and T elements are very detailed and objective about things and if they think that it is appropriate according to their J plans for what the universe wants they will indeed spell out their pain in great detail.  ISFJ will do the same if they think doing so is something that their in group promotes as being a good thing to do and if doing so will make them feel like they fit in better.  But an INTP while having the more complex externally presented goal of having peace cooperation on Earth by organizing everything that everyone else is doing Constantly asking the N T and P questions of What is the universe my community and my closest companion doing? actually has at the deepest and most meaningful level nothing more than a desire to be physically healthysupported as am individual human being.  In other words INTPs brilliance and trying to help everyone else do what they most want to do is ultimately totally selfcentered as a way to finally maybe heal the sick body they were born with.gtJ shows the orientation of the function TF and NS. But it is not a function unto itself according to MBTI.According to MBTI there are no functions.  MBTI is all about these four dimensions.  The functions are combinations of just some of the elements in each dimension.  The function idea comes from outside of the MBTI work.gt Ugh why? Why would any openminded thinker TP buy into some mystic crap about reincarnation karma and other madeup stuff with zero evidence? Any TP worth his salt would consider it and then quickly reject it once they learn that the ultimate goal Buddhism is the snuffing out nirvana of consciousness.Because real Buddhism isnt mystical its about using logic and first hand experience the best kind of evidence to explore reality and thought and philosophy and the human experience.  The core of Buddhism has absolutely nothing to do with the fun intellectually stimulating metaphorical stories about reincarnation and such.Whatever youve been led to believe about Buddhism seems to be very inaccurate.  The ultimate goal of Buddhism is absolutely not snuffing out of consciousness!  The goal is reducingeliminating suffering which is caused by attachment to ideasbeliefs about what reality is.  In other words the goal of Buddhism is to eliminate dogma.  Nirvana is the freedom from believing that you are right which as youve already mentioned is impossible since we are always limited by our awareness of reality given that were limited beings.  You can also say that the goal of Buddhism is to become a P since Ps are always open minded about reality and seek to understand how it works rather than having a Judging attitude of thinking that one already knows everything.  Socrates one of the most awesome and famous INTPs was a Buddhist at heart since he said that the wisest person was the one who knows that they know nothing. Judging religions are for Judgers.  Perceiving religions like Buddhism and Transcendentalism Emerson Thoreau etc. and even Kopamism are for the open minded bigpicture thinkers like us INTPs and ENTPs and even the kind of contradictory ISFPs.  And only Js think other peoples beliefs are bullshit.   Ps are always open minded about everything since we know that reality is complex and messy and weird!Youre totally right that Js hate being wrong.  Im not that way.  Im wrong all the time and I love it because it means Im learning something.  But as I said when we TPs have fully explored a topic and we have tested it out to an extreme level we are indeed confident that we are right.  I mean if someone tried to assert that Im actually living in Mogadishu rather than Maine and they seemed serious about their assertion while I would still be open to having this weird view explained to me I would definitely continue to try to correct their assertion because Ive been living in Maine for years and can be pretty damned confident that I havent moved and that no one else has ever called the place Im staying Mogadishu.  So yeah Im not saying that Im guaranteed to be correct about my explanations of the MBTI dimensions and Im still happy to listen to your point of view about it and happy to change my beliefs about it if you show me something new informationwise because Ive spent so much time and energy researching MBTI and other brain development and style information Im very confident that I am very close to being right.  If I was a J like I used to be Id be getting angry and rude and all that unpleasant stuff because you had a different viewpoint than I have.  But Im very definitely not and I dont think you are either so Im pretty sure youre a P as well or at least not too J to have an interesting and friendly conversation .,entp,cqw2rjj,1,t5_2qoy3

4042522,0,t3_36ttwc,I dont mind the idea of having an eternal consciousness but if I had to live forever tied to some sort of physical existence or the same body Id rather not.  I think physical pleasures and pains are novel and fascinating to a degree but after awhile I start seeing a pattern in the novelty and its easy to extrapolate and realize that even the unique will eventually become tired and boring.The reasons and scenarios which could make me want to live for an eternity would require a disembodied consciousness since Id eventually find even being an intelligence housed in machinery to be limiting.  If I could roam the universe freely that would be amazing. I could imagine spending weeks happily staring at the sun or gazing at the silent surface of Saturn from my perch on one of its moons.  I could easily spend a human lifetime just exploring this one solar system and could rack up a thousand years in just this galaxy.  The hard part is the physics of having to move mass around the universe like that too time consuming and cumbersome for my taste and Im a rather patient person. My repressed Se says physical sensations arent enough to stay alive for past a regular lifespan. Ni says I can guess how things will play out and that once I get the gist Ill get bored.

4113809,0,t1_crp3gyq,I have about fifty thoughts in a blender here but I dont have any real context. I am so sorry that you grew up with the parents that you had or didnt have. Thanks but no worries thats what RBN is for. I came here for objective debate and discussionAnd I cant even begin to tell you how baffling these forums are. Most baffling is the fact that I cant tell who the good guys or the bad guys are in about half of them. The other half are pretty obvious. I am all for living the world without black and white extremes but this is awful.Right thats part of the problem because abusive people almost unilaterally claim that they are the victim so it takes a lot of paying attention to figure out who is who.Hadnt thought of it like this. I guess I would weigh it based on the types of abuse as to what the perpetrators were like. Pedos vs. Sex Trafficking Kidnappers vs. Domestic Violence vs. Murderers vs. Arsonists vs. White Collar Criminals vs. criminalfillintheblanksfortherest would seem to be casebycase and classbyclass overall. I dont think they can all be toddlers can they?Definitely not. I wouldnt consider an armed bank robber who had been planning his crime for months then scaring everyone in the bank with threats to be a giant toddler. More likely to be on the spectrum of sociopath.But what about the guy who is short on rent and whatever else he needs money for and goes in and just rob a bank or store on the fly? Is that guy any different from a toddler or the guy who planned it out for months?I dont think they would be in either category maybe it was just an act of desperation? Either way though the trauma to the people being scared out of their wits being held up at gunpoint isnt dependent on the robbers motive.At my last job one of my responsibilities was to get people approved for credit for a large purchase. I had a customer one day who wanted to use his credit union for financing. Ok no problem. This guy looked like an NFL linebacker. We called the credit union together on speakerphone to do the application. They were busy and didnt have time to process a phone application and suggested it would be better to physically go to the branch. So we hung up and I assumed he would just go over there and come back because the branch was down the block.He started shaking like a leaf and was visibly very upset. What? I asked him whats wrong?He said his wife had been in the bank two years ago when it was robbed and neither of them have physically been there since they only do online banking.I asked him if he would feel ok going if I went with him? This is comical because I am a short small woman. He agreed we went to the credit union and got his loan papers but the entire time he was terrified. So does it matter what the intention of the robber was? Maybe the robber had a child who needed surgery and he couldnt afford it. Maybe the robber just had a psychotic break that day. Who knows? The effects to the people who were there are the same no matter what his intentions were. What I meant was people who are abusive and emotionally manipulative without ever knowing they are being that way.This sentence confuses me so much but I get it after reading the cluelessness of those parents and some of the children. Did you notice that the reddit support forums technically fall closer to the estranged parents on the chart in some situations? That was weird to me but I guess I need to not see it in black and white either.Sometimes but unlike the estranged parents forums people on the reddit support subs get called out for shitty behavior and encouraged to change. Those people generally go away. There are in my opinion people on there who just make up lies for sympathy or to make fun of the sub by showing how ridiculous they think it is but whatever. If thats how they want to spend their time getting advice for problems they dont have then they are just stupid.Then when people dont want to deal with them anymore because of their awful behavior have a tantrum because they legitimately cant connect their behavior to the consequences. Its all part of normal everyday life for them and they have no idea or dont want to know or dont want it to be true why people dislike dealing with them. For example  is a comparison between forums for estranged parents and forums of adult children of abusers. I use this example because I am familiar with the topic but there are other studies done about adult relationships where domestic violence occurs and the abuser has no freaking clue why the abusee left.I agree but also domestic violence escalates over time. It doesnt deescalate. I think some people get caught in the following trap. One shitty experience that they have to explain for the rest of their life. A DUI. An Assault Charge. Any number of things that are considered crimes of moral turpitude. These things leave big black marks on peoples lives. And then you explain it to the next partner and it becomes the habit. I will use soft words here because you were abused on many levels. Please dont modify your wording for my benefit. Im fine. If I want to be treated with kid gloves Ill go elsewhere. Normal me can deal with any words at any time. Traumatized me can go hang out in RBN. Im trying to get past all the nonsense that happened last year not wallow in it.It is very easy to get caught in this trap and not know. It is also very easy to not be in this trap and think that you are caught.Meh I agree with the first part but you would have to be pretty delusional to think you are being abused when you are not.Its bizarre that people can be so selfunaware.edit to add Another more neutral example would be a manager who doesnt understand why his employees keep quitting on him and he has low retention rates. So he rationalizes it by saying something like All the people I hire are morons who have no work ethic and never finish things!That manager is a moron. But is he rehabitable? I have no clue. Have you ever had a manager like that?I did have a boss like that once Kelly. Ugh what a raging bitch. She wasnt nearly as bad as my mom though so her tactics didnt work on me which confused her. Sucks for her I was the top producer in her region and I quit.When really everyone just hates working for him because he stomps around all day yelling at people calling them morons and threatening to fire them every day. Who wants to work for someone like that? Nobody. But the manager cant connect the dots.Edited to take out PM. Didnt realize this was a wallthread reply. Sorry.,entp,crp77g0,1,t5_2qoy3

4249598,0,t1_cs4lbj5,Yeah cycles are inherent in just about everything.  Many Millennials are the children of Boomers and grew up in a world controlled and shaped by Boomers.   GenX grew up in a world mostly shaped by the Greatest Generation.  Remember the leaders  and instigators of the Civil Rights moment werent young idealistic Boomers...they were older.  MLK was born in .  Rosa Parks was born in .  She was  when she did the bus thing.  Cynically you can say the Boomers main interest in the Peace movement wasnt pacifism but rather the lack of wanting to risk themselves for a cause they didnt believe in. Certainly the most profound influence right now especially with laterborn Millennials is the ubiquity of the Internet.  Anyone born after  grew up online.  I think the biggest negative effect of this is the erosion of community and civic virtue. This goes handinhand with the narcissism of Millennials.  Growing up in neighborhoods you made due with what was around you.  But growing up on the internet allows one to pick and choose exactly what you want to deal with....you can find very precise communities like subreddits that act as engines of confirmation bias.  Circlejerks dont just happen from upvotes they also happen when down votes suppress dissenting opinions below visibility. The Millennials are fucked financially speaking.  Theyre already poor indentured servants.  They just dont know it because unlike the poor of  years ago they both grew up with luxuries and expect to have them but also have massive amounts of debt.   The poor of  years ago were used to having nothing and never expected a credit line to buy the latest toy.  The problem with all the credit is that the economy is moving in such a way that they wont have the jobs to pay it off.Look at the big valuation companies these days...Google Facebook Twitter Amazon...these companies dont actually make anything. And they employ next to no one.  Theyre not engines of industry.  Theyre virtual harvesters...scooping up money from IPOs and advertising.  ,entp,cs4n68h,6,t5_2qoy3

4624616,0,t1_ctddwo8,Yes as I have said this post is more of a tentative speculation and it is overgeneralized. However I think the assumption itself that these dichotomies exist is not inconsistent with MBTI. Of course I am not saying that these opposite characteristics can be observed in every person constantly but they may have the potential to behave this way.Just a few examples to illustrate my reasoning. I know an ESTJ who is a loudmouth badass lawyer assertive yet when he cut his pinkie with a knife last week he literally cried like a little girl bitchy. He does this all the time. I have an engineer INTJ friend who is always talking about aeronautics and poetry intellectual. When drunk however he transforms into a raging monster animalistic.This is of course just cherry picking but I come across these kinds of things a lot.I disagree about the ISFJs though.

I keep patterns around which I tinker with and I keep simple utility functions like going through cookies sorting etc.  But what I like about this job is being able to invent the best shit for the job.  There are also copyright issues with scabbing code from your old place.  Usually Ill look at things i did as a reference and then go from there.  Not to mention the fact that code doesnt work forever.  You are supporting different environments with different inputs and outputs and the more branch logic bullshit you have to check if this is validpresentwhatever the slower your code runs.  Which is a big problem with frameworks and off the shelf plugins.  Frameworks are great for keeping everyone on the same page and for doing the same damn thing the same damn way every time.   The tradeoff is that frameworks require extra work to get interesting shit done but empower people who dont know their shit to do simple things.  I dont take jobs where thats the order of the day.  Right now Im moving everyone to a new framework and project architecture because we dont have a lot of front end knowledge here... but for people who know what theyre doing frameworks get in the way as often as not.  And you have to learn all the specific little ins and outs of the framework.  The same rule applies for plugins.  Once you know what youre doing you probably save time in the long run just writing your own shit... provided that you document well.  Inevitably someone will ask for a feature which doesnt exist in the plugin and then youre in wrapper hell... doing what I spent the last few days doing trying to find the right hooks which were often poorly implemented by someone who possibly knows less than you do.  Libraries though are great.  Jquery modernizr require.js etc keep you from having to worry too much about cross browser issues.  You can say hey is this feature supported?  If yes great do blah if not do blah.  It smooths the waters a bit as it were.  All that said you need to know how to work with frameworks hahaha.  In actually being able to troubleshoot them and to work with them really effectively eventually you need to be capable of writing your own.

The picture lists some very famous people. ExTJs get ahead by being pitbulls...they bite onto their careers and dont let go.But if youre not exceptionally smart trying to be an expertgeneralist will fail. Why?  Because they key is being an expert at one thing and knowing a shit ton about everything else....being almost an expert.   So an expert at one thing and still better than almost everyone else in other areas. Most people have difficulty becoming an expert at all....good luck at becoming a quasiexpert in multiple fields without basically having genetic shortcuts. Im not saying it cant be done but its not really something most people can strive for.  Personally I think most ENTPs would get more out of combining their interests and finding a niche to take advantage of and framing their generalist tendencies as an advantage.

5538358,0,t1_cwiupe2,hmm i dont know to be honest. I feel the field medicine is to broad to say that all doctors need the same background. I have been attending conferences on the lacks of the current medical system and stuff like that the past year. They all basicaly said the same and none of them came up with a solution. Actually the one topic I shouldnt take because of the possible extra work and stressload  but am taking upon me anyhow  somehow i just feel lacking when not spending time on it with selfstudying is reading books about how patient care and the healthcare sector could be improved. Including keeping up with more about the technical advancements behavioral theories etc. its just.. so much. On the other hand i hope this helps me because its related to medical care as well and of the defined current canmed roles  roles are not really that highlighted that much at the current medical curricula healthadvocate managerleader coordinator basically I get the idea that they are experimenting with how to introduce those and get them working but in what I knowhave seen its not correct. Yet as you saymention this would be me from an outsider perspective and not from an insider perspective saying the people who have been working in healthcare for a longer time dont necessarily know better. Anyway seeing as the way of conventional teaching is not as productive and good either as it could be.. hello research I think there is no other way to bring improvement than from learning both things. Like learning what they teach then learning from different sources then going back to what they teach what I would change and then study for exams.Its ridiculous and highly preassumptuous not including the extra time needed from me to think this is best but I cant find any evidence that contradicts what I think. At least not at those conferences I attended.  as mentioned earlier they just say the same thing this is not good thats not good blablabla We dont know how to fix it the government should do BLABLA the conclusion I draw out of it is that the curricula for students here should be changed for those  canmed roles.  not necessarily for the hard facts but i cant remember those hard facts come on they some examples of arrhytmias of the heart not all I have seen with some example ECGs right now while I basically have had all of them and want to learn all of them by comparing them together with learning the straight facts instead of learning some signs without other signs for diagnosis,entp,cwjko1r,1,t5_2qoy3

Also  degrees Celsius is arbitrary why does it matter how far the temperature is from freezing at sea level? In the case of these sort of measurements We need to know what amount of change matters  and makes sure that level of change is visible. because small changes in temperature are significant we should truncate the graph. minor tangent to prove the point Celsius is truncated kelvin and remains used because its horribly annoying to say today was  degrees which is ever so much better than yesterdays bitter cold  degrees.  Of the range has increased by . degrees than it is not statistically indistinguishable from zero and both sides are engaged in misleading language and interpretation of graphs. If the uncertainty is more than half then we still know the lower bound has raised but . and the upper bound has raised by . and that the lower bout is almost the same original upper bound. Just because the range contains some of the same numbers doesnt mean they are indistinguishable.  He even admitted that .degrees was mportant but never acknowledges that Celsius  isnt in any was actually a universal constant and in fact its continued use despite us knowing about absolute  is a direct contradiction to the point his making. However i fully admit that the other side is shit too. the shitty nitpicking of data is not real science and the hockey stick is legitimate propaganda that needs to be removed from public consciousness. i didnt know about the hot spot anomaly and will need to look deeper since i dont understand what the hell its a graph of since it was meaningless to me. His explanation mostly conveyed that he considers himself knowledgeable about the graphs and not what the graphs represents.

5779105,0,t3_3uasvc,You cant really type someone very well by emotional expression.  That is not a direct function of type but rather of experience maturity etc. ENTP vs ENFP comes down to Ti vs Fi.Ti says I think this because it is undeniable true.  Fi says I think this because it is true for me.  Basically whats going to separate them out is if your ENTP believes something sincerely that is kind of illogical.  Its sort of an MBTI joke that all ENFPs believe in astrology.   But its a good example of Fi vs Ti type reasoning.  A T user would reject astrology because it has no empirical support and no selfconsistent validity.  But an Fi user can construct their own meaning out of it and find it useful. Another tell would be how he handles challenges to his opinions.  If he spouts off an opinion and you intellectually challenge him  will be get pissy and defensivechange the topic thats Te changing the environment because you just pissed off Fi.  Or will his eyes light up and get really excited about countering your argument.  Note I said excited by being intellectually challenged  not defensive.

I think the quality of friendships is largely a personal thing and its not based on introversion versus extroversion.I think if you are a mature extrovert you know who your friends are and who your acquaintances are. If youre manipulative you can make acquaintances think they are friends. Or if youre not and your acquaintances are also extroverted you will both know exactly where you stand with each other and youll have a fuzzy guideline of the bounds of your friendship. That said you will also probably have one or more closer friends with whom you can share more with do more for and expect more from.If the person who wrote this article only has one or two close friends with whom they share everything they may have seen an extrovert dealing with hisher friend circle which is probably layered with good friends sort of friends people Id invite to a party people I dont really fuck with but will shake hands with an say hi etc and assumed from a distance that they were all buddy buddy with each other.

6069765,0,t1_cyf7bmd,gt Half of my realizations come from saying them out loud.Thats Ti.  The logic of how things relate come from your subconscious.   You suddenly know how the things youre observing all fit together.With INTJs its Ni. They get something more like a holistic pattern match  the observation itself comes to them.  So in a way for them its all about how to express the thought and the structuring of that thought comes from Te...so you will hear them building an argument in a methodical way fleshing out the details as they go.  The weakness is that all the Te work can be build on a bed of assumed Ni sand.  Similarly all of the Ti logic checking can be spent on a stupid Ne idea. More generally NeTi tends to see how superficially unrelated things can be related by Ti logic.  And NiTe tends to see how something old can be applied in a new way.   SeTi and SiTe work the same way except are more focused on pragmatic concerns...that is...things which actually exists in the here and now not potentialities.   That makes them more risk adverse when it comes to new ideas. ,entp,cyf8h4z,1,t5_2qoy3

Consider that Ti Fi would basically be a crazy person I think this I feel this I dont need any outside data its just what it is.  The cognitive functions dont represent nature.

The Fe keeps us in line and Im not sure if I think these thoughts consciously as much in the moment or of its more of an after realization? Like oh I did these things because I knew it would work better. Though when I help someone else plan out how they should approach someone for some issue then I do say these things out loud and actively go through what would appeal and work most. I think if I ever needed to I could be really evil from this perspective but like I have neither the soul nor motivation for it. Jurassic Park D was amazing and hanging out with friends made it better. I want my own version of Blue. And I like the INFJ analysis. I mean I think Im a good person but I know I also have this subtle under thought of I could do this to get my way.... I think it is NTPs that always point out Ni criticisms or like INTP friend was complaining about INXJs the other day to me and an INTJ. Always interesting. ,entp,cyrg3re,1,t5_2qoy3
6177647,0,t1_cyrtd87,Introverted Feeling Seeks harmony of action and thoughts with personal values. May not always articulate those values. meyersbriggs.orgStrong Fi users structure their lives around principles and personal values mantras. They judge every action they take on how much it adheres to their life principles. A good example of Fi is honor codes and oaths following a set of values or some fancy saying Mantra.Mantras like Things will always get better or What goes around comes around have no logical basis only Fi can process them.It also depends on the content of the mantra but the majority of them are hardcore Fi INFP kind of shit not that its bad.,entp,cyru1lr,1,t5_2qoy3

6196430,0,t1_cythv3n,Well its kind of the extreme case for easy identification. I know many Fe users who come off more passive aggressive and less caring. I also know many kind and concerned and great Fi users. So I find that SFJs are generally really caring people. ESFJs are like grandmas to me ISFJs are like mums. They generally put others before them but under stress can be a bit passive aggressive. Or the two ESFJs I knew really well seemed that way and would sigh under their breath about what they were doing or that know one appreciates them etc. ISFJs always seem to burn themselves out helping others and I want to remind them to take care of themselves.ENFJs are generally what I would call highly persuasive  charismatic people. They in general are always likable to me and like to be in charge in a job where they can help. They like to counsel and teach and when they say things its comforting to me. They can be a bit introverted at times as well. INFJs do that more with ideas and prefer to counsel our select people. If you dont know one and walk past I think they can appear cold or apparently sad. However if you befriend one they can be amazingly social. Prolonged social settings are meh because its exhausting to be around that many people because of feelings. IXTJs however generally get bored of social interactions because they just arent in the mood for it want to be alone or it seems tedious. ISTJs split into two types for me all are annoyingly efficient. Some seem more stern they do what they have to do and then leave. These ones may not have a full grasp on what is polite. The other seem to understand feelings a bit more and seem more concerned kind helpful.I think INTJs are the main example where they can come off as aloof or just seem like they missed the big emotional elephant in the room. Its not always that they dont care but that they truly didnt know that other people cared about that thing and they dont understand why. They have feelings but its better at being personally responsible. When they get better at them it seems they complement concrete things and sometimes their sense of humor leads them to saying things where you might want to cringe but its not on purpose. EXTJs are where Fi can appear a bit harsh to me and its masked by Dominate Te. It does whats most efficient and the ones I know seem to be a bit Well I dont care what they feel this is the plan and we need to stick to it. They say somethings that make me cringe a lot at this point I dont know if its more effect or not. I think theyre not very in touch with their own feelings either.INTPs can seem cold at times or not to get things like INTJs but they have Fe. I think this is most clear in how they ask questions or when they get anxious or nervous and go through a TiFe loop.If ISFPs are a bit over sensitive I know some INFPs who are a bit fierce. And by that I mean theyre very comfortable doing their own thing and that scares me. Like theyll sit at a bar alone no worries. They dont care that this person doesnt like them. Also theres one at work that looks at me and I can feel hes trying to look into all of our souls. Not like our Fe but deeply trying to find whatever Fi we have. Im sorry EPs ISTPs and others. I didnt mean to type this up. But basically it was all generalizations on a large scale and heres my generalizations on a smaller scale.I would still ask the same questions. TLDR Fe depends on the social settings of the room Fi depends on how one was raised and their personal morals. This changes type to type based on other functions and orders and heres more specific generalizations.,entp,cytyv0i,3,t5_2qoy3

6474528,0,t3_44agsp,Damn bro have a little empathy.One part of the problem is that the average size has gone up considerably. The average BMI in the US is around . right now. This means the average is almost obese. When the average size is that large it shifts perception considerably. A large portion of overweight people about a third dont even see themselves as overweight. If you tell them they are its like telling someone who thinks theyre a  that theyre really a . Theyll think youre full of shit.Another issue is that we live in a world that makes it very easy to be fat. Cheap fast food and junk food when our bodies are programmed to binge on sugar and fat when its available due to a time when your next meal was quite unpredictable. So to be thin you really are fighting against your own biology.And finally its not just a physical problem. This is a serious mental health issue that we need to confront. Food addiction is a very real problem. By shaming people and pointing out their weight you are not helping. The only thing youre doing is further solidifying that persons belief that foodgood peoplebad. Its like telling a drug addict This is a matter of will. Sober up or get out of my life. They will choose the drug because the drug doesnt make them choose.To solve this problem we need to target the youngest generation. Starting as early as elementary school teach proper nutrition and fitness. Reinforce this by replacing the current school lunches with healthy balanced lunches low in empty carbs and high in lean protein and veggies. Also have daily P.E. from elementary school through high school with middle and high school running a program similar to the La Sierra program JFK experimented with.We have a responsibility to fix this problem yes but not by shaming people. Start at the lowest level so our next generation doesnt grow up with the same habits of their parents and at the same time improve the medical system so that those parents when they go to the doctor are told You need to lose weight for your health this is how and then a honest presentation of the lifestyle changes needed to get there.,entp,czp0gg8,3,t5_2qoy3

Theres also an ENFJ professor army work and Ive been comparing his habits to mine. Or when people complain Im like eh I do that. Its been very interesting.So from this I gatheredENFJs are much more likely to be people focused or engaged. They focus on the actual people via Fe and they are usually charismatic mentorlike and their Ni future orientation lies within these goals. INFJs IMO are more interested in the theory of people and helping in different ways. Wed rather work with the idea than apply it to people?ENFJs also drown me in their Fe. I have a thousand observations and conversations in my mind on this but I dont know how o translate them into words. Theres a clear divide even how their Ti and Se compare to mine. Like their Se is based more on Fe and they like nice things other people like or seem to be a bit more zany in this way. I also feel its a good way to figure out types based on others with your same stack. So I know my Se is developing and is amazing right now.

Yet I know people who every time they go to bed if theyre under stress theyll have nightmares where theyre late or something goes wrong etc. How shitty would that be?

6785091,0,t1_d0kzmtb,I just posted this in rlsd but i think it suits your question  Theres a lot of great advice and great people on this rdrugs rlsd amp rpsychonaut. Personally Ive prepared about  weeks in advance. Id recommend tripping by yourself and Id recommend doing it outside. Put some thought into the general idea of what you want to accomplish while understanding that its mostly out of your control. I like to move while im on the come up it really helps channel that energy into a nice flow rather than letting it turn into anxious jitters. For instance walking around in the forest. Go exploring or something. Ive noticed than when I trip hard I go through this stage where I feel like Im dying or some shit this is the dissolution of the ego. The difference between a difficult trip and more of a divine serene type of trip has been realizing you are fine allowing you ego to lay down to whatever drug you took embracing that body load appreciated the change in conciousness and using it to see further than you are used to. You are in fact not about to die its just the effect of a drug and whether you enjoy it or find it unpleasant is purely mental. Realizing that it is temporary and that you will be fine in spite of your rapidly dwindling ego is what it comes down to. Surrender embrace and appreciate. Also avoid using any other drugs before or during nicotinecaffeinecannabis if youre looking for a spiritual experience. All you need is the L. If you liked it it sounds like you have enough experience to work towards taking a full hit next time. Just think about ways you can improve your experience trust your intuition.,entp,d0ldk9p,2,t5_2qoy3
6793863,0,t1_d0mbla8,Well Im ENTP and like most of us here Im easily distracted from a task. Someone asks a question I have to answer. Someone knocks at my door I get up and talk. But then I need to get back to my work and this distraction has destroyed my workflow. If Im working on something I will accomplish the same amount of work someone can do in  days in a matter of  hours. But its a sort of meditation process I need to install everything around me set up a playlist get a bottle of watercoffee have all my notes at hand and only then can I plunge mentally into the work. If I stop and leave this Zen state its over its gone I have to restart all the setup and I wont get around to doing it for Odin knows how long! So for a  minute talk Ive ruined the equivalent of  days of work and thats not cool.

After the semester sure but not when in half an hour I might need to fail you. In engineering its normal to have  failure rates so I cant get sentimental with them.

Or you dont try and appear like a concerned student and try to suck out some answers from me?Doesnt mean Im a cold teacher or anything like that I spend extra time after classes to help them out answer questions. I make extra material so that if something isnt covered they still have an example. I act as a mentor for my exstudents and will answer their questions about the program. Ive been thanked countless times by students whove told me Im the reason they understood the material.

6990955,0,t1_d18pw7d,gt He doesnt show any inkling of repressed Si or Fe. Quite the opposite... what does classic unhealthy Se make you think of? Drowning yourself in sensory experiences ie drugs casual sex etc all of which hes well known for.Actually speaking from personal experience with chronic pain escapism is a huge temptation. Inferior Si makes it this constant nagging thing that I try to distract myself from. He doesnt deal with the pain in a direct conscious way but tries to escape from it. Si not Se.gtAs for Fi his ethical code is entirely and uniquely his own as has been a subject of conflict in the show more than once. It isnt accommodating or conciliatory in any way as Fe might be. He respects his team members most when they stick to their guns and do what they believe is right. For example in x Family Wilson called out Foreman for undercutting him and House but House defended him telling Wilson Foreman did what he thought was right and calling Wilson a coward for copping out and not doing the same.Alright. So Fe would basically be saying that ethics and conviction are an objective standard. While House does assert his code of ethics above the ethical codes of others he is not doing such in an Fi unconsious feelingethical way I really really really believe this is right. He is doing so in a TiFe way of this is what makes sense to meTi subjective and thats why it is objectively the right thing to do because it is the only option left that makes sense. Where Fi would look back to preconceived notions of right and wrong not being able to separate itself from the situation and overcome them Fe would more so play with the ideas of morality.gtThere is nothing dispassionate or detached about him when hes arguing his views on morality or philosophy.Ok so... look at what he is getting all upset and yelling about. People are looking to Fipersonal conviction right and wrong as it appears unconsciously to them in order to solve their own moral dilemmas. House gets frustrated and yells at them about what makes sense to himTi and states objectively what the right thing to do is as if there is no other rightFe. Hes not allowing so much for differences of opinion on what is right. Fi would make arguments as to the character of the person or the worthiness of their idea  even based on Te the argument would devolve into qualifications. House doesnt do this. He argues what makes sense to the most blind of idiots. I dont think an INTJ would take the time to do this with so many people unless they were being really petty.gtI cant see how his eureka moments arent anything but pure Ni. Thats the aha function thats known for answers seemingly coming out of nowhere. Hell also commonly say something like I need to think when they get stuck shutting himself in his office alone examining symptoms on the whiteboard and looking at chartsscanswhatever letting all the data from the case ruminate in his head. I believe this is him trying to activate or find an answer through his Ni.This actually sounds more like Ne and Ti working together. Him needing a team is a need for Ne jumping points and him sitting thinking things through is Ne Ti going back and forth trying to find the answer. The answers appear in a eureka moment because house has done preliminary Ti work of what does and doesnt make sense in the case and then he finally makes the connection he needed. The one thing that fits the framework.,entp,d18rmho,5,t5_2qoy3

He got so ahead of himself and psyched up about his ideas that he didnt consider that part. Before you ask I did consider that he might be ESTP but hes definitely Ne Ti. He gets too excited bickering and playing devils advocate for fun just to make things interesting to be ESTP. pMy husband is INTP and hes also quite handy with construction engineering if he wants to make something though he prefers his computer war games.I could totally see an ENTP making this for the engineering fun of it.,entp,d1m78bc,1,t5_2qoy3

7152437,0,t3_4dg2sp,Slang comes and then mostly goes.  It mostly has a fadlike quality and mostly exists in spoken language and in modern shortform substitutes for conversation like text messages. A lot of s slang has already faded...like saying hes bookin  to mean going very fast or saying groovy to mean cool.A lot of slang from the huge s youth culture is now unintelligible or really changed.Sorry bub the banks closed!     No kissing allowed.     Egg   The big life..like in the Great Gatsby East EggWest Egg.     Drugstore cowboy   pickup artist.    orBimbo    a tough guy   Goofy    to be in love  Of course a lot of it is still around like John meaning toilet to bullshit to be on the level etc. But a formal written language tends to be more stable and acquire permanent changes at a much slower pace.    It took Italian at least  years to evolve out of Latin.  But especially today the mostly standardized spelling and grammar and worldwide proliferation is a major stabilizing or even fossilizing force on the written language. Major language change is usually driven by pronunciation shifts or intrusion of foreign languages like Norman French mingling with AngloSaxon to make Middle English not simply by fad words. So even the s slang basically  years old has not moved into formal written English.  But it may happen that spoken English evolves into mutually unintelligible dialects all using the same written language.As for Millennial slang the same force that allows it to quickly spread social media will also allow it to quickly dissipate. ,entp,d1r5sl7,2,t5_2qoy3

7240751,0,t3_4efxtk,To me as an ENTP I dont see our types as the kind that fix our faults rather then work with them. We get bored easily and our interests are short lived and sporadic to say the least. I think one of the best things you can work for as an ENTP is patience despite being generally out going i feel we are prone to anxiety that feeds on our strong sense of desire. There is no time limit Live life day by day. Get through your engineering even if it means hitting the bare minimum. Just finish it. Try and look towards learning rather then completing. Try to be intuitive with your work to keep yourself interested as best as possible. Stop obsessing over some miraculous cure for not being a selfmotivated person. ENTP are thought to be this big in your face obnoxious type but we actually work best in the shadows. And what i mean by that is our quick turn to boredom is our strength. Instead of aiming to be the romanticized version of a hard working person we see in media. Work to your strength hone it. What seemed like laziness and fickleness will turn to efficiency. I also think ENTPs are often suited for pastoral positions in the work place. Were typically very good at telling people how to do things and aweful at doing them our selves.,entp,d217yc1,3,t5_2qoy3

It is a numbers game.If she really picked up a guy in  minutes then she is very easy it is all down to Highschoollevel genetics. Yeah for hookups particularly in a setting where you cannot even talk all that well he had more to offer than you did. Or she really was DTF and you did not pick up on it. Do not overanalyze this sometimes what you do is several dates too soon sometimes several minutes too late. A woman is always right even if she is totally irrational because she always does and will have a vagina. So if next time you encounter a comparable situation and you want to increase your chances of being  and him being  then you need to learn you some PUA skills but do not become evil.On the other hand if she is not your kind of girl then fuck her and look for women elsewhere.Maybe she and this guy were already together or met each other previously. Maybe you just do not have the game ... yet or not as much of it.gt There was this kinda cute girl that I had no intentions to approach but as she was not part of the inner circle of friends in the party so to speak I ended up talking to her to make her feel more comfortable and shit.So maybe you friendzoned yourself from the getgo. Also if she is cute then she is not alone for too long. Chances are that someone will approach her and since the awkward nerdy nice guys overwhelmingly piss their pants and selfcockblock then the only ones who are left to approach are the ballsy testosteroneridden gorillas and pretty boys. It is not that those guys are her only type but why would she bother looking for something else when she already receives plenty of attention?For the guy looks do matter but not all that much though when girls are young it matters more I think. Evolutionary she wants a guy who is likely to be able to kill a zebra knock her up defend her and her children from other perverts. When you are this young   little difference in age matters. An  yo guy is suddenly more preferable to a  yo one in general because he has more status more muscle mass more resources he survived for longer. As you get older you get to push the younger boys out. That said you do not have to wait till you are . You can become cocky and funny now. If you want to probe easy girls then you need to adopt the I want to fuck you and I have no apologies for being a man and I am going to be the best attitude and live up to the standard that you set. Your success rate will increase.If you are not into easy girls then you do not need to do a lot of this just be confident work on selfimprovement be funny but still establish dominant social status through wit and humor love yourself and good things will happen.P.S.

Human interests must of course come before those of grass or squirrels or whatever and an interest most of us dont have to think about much anymore is feeding ourselves. But our population is growing. Its growing faster than it ever has. The more people there are the more babies are made and in addition to the exponential increase in reproduction we are living for longer and longer meaning that one person requires more food throughout their life than they otherwise would increasing the amount we must produce. Right now were fine but eventually we will need to produce more. Eventually we will need more farmland than the incorporated fields have room for. When that time comes nature must be pushed aside or preserved in whatever little places we find room for it and be converted to agriculture. Eventually there will simply be no other way.But dont worry because virtual reality has your back!

7383398,0,t3_4gfkla,Analysis of the painting.The stallion represents the ENTP the woman the INFJ.   Notice how the left of the picture is dominated by light which symbolizes the Exterior World extroversion and the clear rationality of Thinking.  The horse has left Platos cave. The right side is dominated by darkness and shadows the interior Introverted World and the murky smothering Feeling.  The horse is muscular and illuminated which represents the strength of Ti but he is still a black horse which means he carries with him the taint of the cave. This is the inferior Feeling function in all Thinkers which can never be totally obliterated. The woman is a shadow creature.  She has emerged from the shadows and is illuminated by Rationality but in comparison to the horse she is black on the inside.   Her red hair reflective of the Light of Rationality represents the false allure of the Feeler who at times may seem rational but deep down underneath it all there urks a black soul of Feeling.Why has the INFJ emerged from the shadow world of Ni?The INFJ is not riding the ENTP rather she is dragging the ENTP into the shadows to be consumed. The horse has realized this which is why he has a look of stark terror on his face. He is literally puking at the thought of having been deceived enough to let the INFJ take a ride.  How did the deception occur?  The INFJ took advantage of the horses stain his black soot he has carried out of the cave of Feelings. The INFJ wears a look of ecstasy as she grips the horse around the jugular and summons the Feeler shadows to consume him.  Within the shadows the horse will groomed combed out saddled bridled and gelded then used by the INFJ succubus to do her shopping and pick up the miniINFJs from soccer practice.  INFJ refer to this as finding a soul mate or colloquially as marriage.    ENTPs who have escaped call this place Hell. ,entp,d2hfxl4,15,t5_2qoy3

Replace senators with a collection of neural networks evolved with genetic algorithms to emulate an aggregate of people on points along the political spectrum.. Give people the ability to vote for and against like  of the the ones they supporthate based on what they supportedshotdown.. The  worst are replaced with the offspring of the  best while the  best stay the same and the other  mutate slightly.This would make them essentially evolve into nobullshit politicians that consistently with the interests of their constituency and prevent bullshit.However because they dont get to change all of them ones on both sides would get selected in proportion to their representative ability to people. e.g.  shittiest on one side wont usually be the  best on the other side.The House could pass laws that dont suck easier. The President could side with them and laws would easily be passed. Or if it gets wacky the House and president could vote against them.

7549702,0,t1_d303o2q,gtLove is one of the most common experiences you can have. That is why we have so much poetry and music and whatnot about love because its so relatable.Actually I disagree. The desire to be loved is universal. Affection attraction and infatuation are common every day experiences. Love is extremely rare.Some poems and songs reference love because it sounds better than I want to put my dick in you lol. Theres using love as a cover for something much more common and base. But generally I think youre right. Most of these love songs and poems are about love. Real and true love. However the fact that there are thousands...millions of such songs in my opinion only further proves that true love is extremely rare.How many songs can you name that are about eating breakfast? Or taking a shower? Or mowing a lawn not as a euphemism but really just about mowing a lawn?Im sure there are a few. But generally speaking people dont spend their time writing songs and poems about the common every day experiences. The fact that millions of people have spent so many hours thinking about and longing for and pondering the nature of love only goes to show how rare and precious love was in their life.But yes I will concede to your point of gtAlmost everyone falls in love and out of love and back in love again.But only because as usurferofinternets pointed outgtIts like when you wonder whether other people see blue the same way as you do. We can both say weve been in love but was it the same feeling?When using the word love I understand that Im actually referencing a type of relationship for which there is a great variance in degree and depth of feeling. However if truth be told I dont think that love is entirely subjective. I know that there is no way to specifically measure what a person feels when they love someone else...but I think love is and can be measured at least in part by sacrifice. Sacrifice itself is not love.But if you tell me you love someone I will say to you what have you sacrificed for them?There is as type of love that takes the occasional Friday night and the cost of a dinner for two.Then there is the type of love that makes you feel lucky to be able to give up everything you have for the sake of rebuilding your life with another person. When you lose that kind of love I dont know...Yeah i get that a statement like gtYoure single until you fall in love...then youre never single ever again. Youre only ever with someone or alone.Is totally dramatic which is why I hope Ill disagree with it in short order...but true deep love is scarce. You only know how rare after youve experienced it lost it and start trying to find it again.  ,entp,d30d591,1,t5_2qoy3

This statement gt I guess it all depends on what you are willing to say is credible but I would never use my astrological information to try and help me determine which type I am.

And what is astrological information?  The very premise of astrology is completely incompatible with scientific thinking.  Either you can believe that the planets exert mystical energy on our souls or you can believe that the idea is completely without merit given that it has never stood up to any form of scientific scrutiny and is logically incompatible with what we understand and are able to test so far as how the universe appears to work.

That specific mechanism was indeed not one of your arguments.gtYou dont need AI for any of this. Much of it can be accomplished by doing statistics on large data sets.My intention was to address the specific kind of personally identifiable profiling that you mentioned in your top comment where someone can associate your assumedly anonymous profile information on Reddit with your public profile information on other sites. Some people call this deanonymization. When you are talking about taking an anonymous profile on the internet like Reddit and associating that with some personally identifying information like Target.com the complexity of the problem is not trivial.There are some anonymous data sets that are easy to deanonymize E.g. it is relatively easy for Target to take some contextuallyrelated information about a user and stitch these together. Even if it requires a bit of guessing to associate a particular phone to a transaction at the checkout counter the number of candidate phones and transactions in a particular place and time is small.There are some anonymous data sets that are much more challenging to deanonymize. Attempting to associate anonymous Reddit information with a person is more difficult because the data set becomes more sparse and most of the useful information in the profile is text which requires semantic information extraction tools.The data set is sparse because most of the profiles in both data sets will have nothing to do with each other at all but there is no easy way to know that without checking them.The anonymous information that can actually identify your Reddit profile is in the form of comments and timestamps.  The kinds of topics you talk about and links that youve shared  The kinds of topics you interact with  Your word usage frequency statistics vocabulary  Your sentiment  mood of speech  The variations in your sentiment over time  The time of day you are normally using these services  If you stop using both services for roughly the same period because you were on vacation or somethingTraditional statistical analysis tools are not practically useful tool for sparse problem sets nor for natural language processing. These kinds of problems are what AI tools are built for. As I mentioned such AI tools are under very active and motivated development. One way of helping the problem is to use humanenabled AI tools but these are also resourceintensive.My hope was to point out that its not even close to as easy as most people perhaps not you think to associate such information. It is just very resourceintensive and costprohibitive even with AI tools.Rational entities companies will ONLY expend money on something that they expect to pay them back more someday.

Because they are not only very different from the MBTI classic ideas and the neurology stuff but also different from what I have discovered as well.  And yes different expressions of the four dimensions can lead to some conflicts in the brain.  Its like having a short and fat cat versus a short and skinny one vs. a tall and fat one vs. a tall and skinny one.  They are all different.  And my definitions are taken straight from the MBTI and neurobiology stuff.  This isnt my own theory this is the classical stuff combined with the modern mainstream science research.And again everyone has both of each dimension at some point in some circumstances.  Personality is just a defaultgeneral preference.  When a Feeling Introvert type someone who aims to understandexplore what their community wants to get makes decisions its based on what they think their community believes is the rightnormalaccepted way to do things.  This isnt a preference for doingmaking stuff because they are introverts.  This is a preference for making decisions based on what their community things is rightnormalaccepted as opposed to making decisions based on being innovative and experimental to find new ways of doing things.  Yes the word doing is in there but that just talks about making decisions about HOW to do things.  For example if we want to grow a garden a Feeling type would follow the lead of the gardeners around them and do it the way the others do it while the Thinking types might look for different ways to grow things.And the fact that you believe that you cant build a flying car without knowing how to do so doesnt stop Extraverts from trying!  Thats the classic ADHD trait being excited about doing something but not really putting in the research to do it effectively.  Mostly when successful they have just gotten lucky.  If they are ExTx types though they have a pretty good chance hence the ENTP high success rate.And these are different dimensions unrelated.  Each of the  types are different.  They are only similar where they have the same type.  ExFx and ExTx are quite different so no they dont go together really.  Other than it appears that the first and third dimensions are the more masculine ones while the second and fourth dimensions are the more feminine ones.  But to say that dopamine and testosterone go together is not really scientifically useful since you can have a low uptakeproduction of one and a high uptakeproduction of the other or any other combination.  These are absolutely independent.  First person second person third person and fourth person are all independent dimensionsperspectives.

7997282,0,t3_4onhix,Ive been thinking that it might actually be possible for those two types seeming like each other due to having completely reversed functions. Both have each others subconsciousshadow functions as their conscious functions and backwards so its like ESFP is ENTP turned inside out if that makes sense. The ESFP would reflect and act out ENTPs inner self outside and vice versa even if their cognitive style is completely different.  ENTps and ESFps are also described as having SuperEgo relations with each other in Socionics so thats another reason why I think it might be possible that ENTP would think like an ENTP but seem more like an ESFP inside. Because theyre each others superegos. And the same would apply to any two types that have the same first and fourth letters but different middle letters in their label.just a thought.,entp,d4eyyio,1,t5_2qoy3

I get anxious when I do nothing for too long and I have to be up and doing stuff almost all the time. Honestly its really annoying being a w because all I care about is succeeding and wanting to do great things but I still fail and quit things a lot. I know that a lot of other ENTPs here just go with it and think Its fine. I honestly envy those ENTPs because I wish I could be okay with just going with the flow and realizing that I can stop doing things and that its FINE. Ill be FINE. But its so hard to see that way. When I fail or dont do something I automatically beat myself up for it because all I want is perfection that doesnt exist. If I get a  on a test all I can think about is the  I missed. It makes me feel unintelligent. Theres nothing more annoying than be a Type A who doesnt know how to prioritize and succeed even when its all I care about. Luckily Im starting on ADD meds this month.

Everything that Superman is.Do you want to be Superman who cant get a date even though hes a living god. Or do you want to be Mary Poppins that solves everyones problems despite being mortal? And is infinitely MORE perfect than Superman?Your SO has a problem. And you have a problem. Its a problem thats about to be solved with some major amount of pain. Thats what painkillers are for. What problem is left?You feeling sappy and weepy and emo over the little child that could have been? Thats a problem. Solve it by reminding yourself of  chance of birth defect  chance of being born Evil psychopath narcissist or rightwing authoritarian now that wouldnt be a problem except remember infanticide is illegal! plus it would take you  years to be able to tell.  chance of being born unNT thus incapable of philosophy. Are nonphilosophers even human?You want to have a kid? Find an NT adolescent or young adult to mentor. Its cheap AND effective. And badly necessary with how many NTs are being raised by narcissists rightwing authoritarians and even psychopaths. Low chance theyll break your heart virtually no chance theyll commit homicide.Its not that you dont know what to feel because thats bullshit. Its that you dont know what to DO. Youre in a situation that has overwhelming high negatives and strictly potential high positives and you dont know what to DO to change the situation so that all the positives are recovered while the negatives are avoided.Why else would you not be feeling relief anxiety and slight impatience at getting it over with?You dont like how youre feeling? Thats a problem identify the problem thats causing you to feel how you are feeling. And right now youre feeling I dont know and meh. Once youve identified it superhyperdefine the problem until a solution naturally bubbles up. INTPs survey for solutions ENTJs find solutions ENTPs hyperdefine the problem. And if a solution doesnt bubble up thats just another problem so now identify and hyperdefine why that isnt happening. In a recursive loop until you hit its impossible or oh solution yay!See your stupid post was all I dont know how to feel. Does that even remotely sound hyperdefined to you? It isnt. So break down the scenario youre feeling things ABOUT into different facets then decide what to feel about each of those.  chance of birth defects gt feel disgust and revulsion? terror?  chance of born evil gt feel  chance of born NT gt feel. pain of labor gt feel. pain of abortion gt feel. use of painkillers when youre obviously a Christian Scientist whos forsworn modern medical treatments gt feel.Everyone here doesnt know what to say about your I dont know what to feel post.

I didnt pursue any of them except the ISFJ she only saw me as a friend and ENFP currently working on that. ESFP was a complete nutcase  she could change her mind within hours the friendships she had were superficial at best the relationships she had were short and mostly focused on sex. She was the kind of girl that wants to be FWB with you on the one day I declined and turns up with a new boyfriend two days later. She also had some psychological issues so there is that. ISFJ was really stable friendly and interesting. I loved and still love to talk to her  were still friends so in the end I really lost nothing here  but you could tell the N vs. S difference in those conversations. ENTJ was intimidating. She didnt want to come off that way but she definitely was. Besides she was intelligent friendly yet direct and quite attractive. ENFP is who I currently like. Shes bubbly friendly caring imaginative sometimes has issues to focus on something but can show her Te when she has to. I havent met a female INFJ irl yet but Id say INFJ ENTP or ENFP are good matches. Id prefer NTs and NFs but on the other hand S types have a lot to offer as well  their focus on the here and now and on concrete matters is complementary to my focus on the abstract and bigger picture I guess. ,entp,d6utp19,2,t5_2qoy3

8748604,0,t1_d6yt64h,Im just old enough that I grew up without technology lol.When I was a kid we went outside because there was nothing to do inside.  TV had  channels and had limited kids programming. You only watched it Saturday morning or perhaps at pm with the rest of your family if there was something interesting. Home video games didnt exist and when they did show up you couldnt exactly play the Atari for  hours straight like WoW.  No one had computers and neither did your school.  I went to a college for kids program after school where I learned BASIC on a mainframe lol. Normal kids played sports and hung out and nerds played DampD and hung out  exactly like Stranger Things....they got it spot on.  I also was into music and read voraciously.  So in a way you had to fill up a lot of that time by yourself by creating entertainment. There were so many garage bands.  There just was not a lot of vapid consumption as there is today  endless TV or absorbing video games in particular or the endless social cesspits like FacebookInstagrametc that can completely absorb teenagers.When Feynman was growing up it was even more so.  Besides his genius he also benefited from having a father who was very mentoring and an early school environment where he had peers and good teachers. Im not being a curmudgeon and claiming kids these days but I think the iPhone really the internet pocket computer has created a true beforeafter divide as much if perhaps not more than electricity did.  Were still too early into it to see how it will all pan out.  Mostly we use them now for entertainment the easiest use but I think theyre slowing evolving into second brains. So yeah while a kid can jump on the Internet and learn just about anything...dear god Wikipedia would have ruined me....there is simply too much.  And all that access is also driving some seriously ridiculous amount of competition.  I saw this program at a friends the other day on the Food Network called Chopped...basically a cooking competition for chefs.  They were having a teen tournament.  But the kids...not just some kids who like to cook...these were kids who had culinary training worked in restaurants trained with personal coaches etc.  At like ... I was sort of astounded.

8758224,0,t3_500nir,When I burn my bridges they are gone as well. I hate when friends come to me and talk shit about someone then turn around and speak fondly to them. I love that they can forgive and all but in a lot of cases it just seems skeevy. Theres a difference between forgiving someone and letting them back into your life to take advantage of you again. I hate seeing my friends do that. Sometimes its not my friend I feel sorry for its the person who likes them after they said so many terrible things behind their back. I think the best thing to do is to avoid being involved. If your friend claims to hate someone that doesnt mean you have to treat them badly. Remain as the neutral party unless it becomes personal in some way. Take anything anyone says about another person as a onesided report. Im not saying you should doubt your friends just that you should back off and remember there are many sides to the same story. ,entp,d70fr1c,2,t5_2qoy3

8807145,0,t3_50qqr9,This was exactly my thought when starting highschool I wanted to become a better version of myself I still do. Im in my third year of highschool now. My freshman year was filled with dramas toxic relationship fear of being alone and me manipulating everyone with my other ENTP friend. I didnt study ate unhealthy foods and gained weight didnt sleep properly and watched anime for hours was depressed and irresponsible af. My bestfriend stopped talking to me because of some rumours that werent even true he didnt talk to me for months and had to apologize for  months afterwards.My second year wasnt that bad. I stopped talking to idiots manipulating people and ate a little bit healthier. I studied much more than before. I was the person who could make everyone laugh in class. Then I got interested in intellectual topics and current ideologies pushed everyone to debate with me basically played devils advocate gained some admirers since I was starting to get rid of depression and show my true nature. In addition I had an ENTP math teacher who basically marked me as his favorite and we had so much fun together he makes students call me during class and we debate lol. Also I dont have this fear of being alone now. Im not a member of a particular friend group and I talk to everyone even teachers. These kind of stupid dramas and challanges gave me the opportunity to grow so if things dont go as planned just endure it and never try to be someone other than yourself. I hate cheesy quotes but its true.,entp,d76hzem,2,t5_2qoy3

8839286,0,t1_d79xg7a,gt Im not arguing from a specifically Christian or Jewish standpoint. Im just saying that religion in general has been inseparable from the establishment and propagation of the obvious morals we take for granted. And like I mentioned previously even more complex issues  like the matter of natural rights  are steeped in religious terms.But this is because we had no other explanation. Once the enlightenment gained traction religion became an unimportant factor for morality and law. Morality has developed in pretty much the same fashion around the world regardless of the prevailing religion. If anything religion provided terminology and a superficial reason to act moral. The latter has been rendered irrelevant to moment Secular Humanism rolled around.As far as rights go yes The USC refers to inalienable rights endowed by our creator but why does it matter? Rights are the creation of humans. Theres nothing divine about them and people would have come to the same conclusions sooner or later. At the time calling them divine was the easiest way to convince people of their legitimacy. This wouldnt work by todays standards. I agree that religion has influenced our conceptions of law and morality but religion wasnt the driving force and things would probably look roughly the same had it been completely absent. gt The big bang is every bit as much conjecture as the idea of a creator. And even if it does turn out to be the correct theory then it still fails to account for the impetus of the explosion in the first place. I see nothing wrong with the assumption that the universe must have been created. I consider the first three of St. Thomas Aquinas five proofs to the existence of God as perfectly rational backing to support the assumption that a creator must exist. The last two of those five are interesting but less compelling IMO.Likewise there is nothing that requires the universe to be created. gt I dont think religion must necessarily become relegated to a purely didactic role. There are serious questions that science is woefully underequipped to answer. Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? Is there an afterlife? Is there a soul? Perhaps there is no reason there is no meaning there is no afterlife and there is no soul. Or perhaps all those things really do exist and if they do the implications are enormous we go from utter pointlessness to our existence having meaning.Which are all questions that wouldnt be here if it werent for religions claiming to know the answers. As Azdahak pointed out in another post religion claims to know answers for questions it spawned in the first time. Without religion we wouldnt bother with the concept of an afterlife because it wouldnt concern us. Wed accept the scientific explanation that our body will decay after we die. We could use the philosophical answer that the sum of our accomplishments and creations will bring us close to a passive afterlife where we stay alive in the minds and hearts of the people around us or those that remember us for the ideas tools books etc. we produced. gt Since we cant know the answers to these questions without dying first I think Pascals wager with some modification makes good sense. Ive already dismissed some criticisms of that wager in another thread and am leaving a permalink here in case you feel like looking through it.Looked through it. It was a fair analysis but I disagree with the last part.Lets assume the God of the Bible exists and Id have to face him after I die. If I believe my pastors words and most recently the Popes word as well Id be able to go to heaven as a nonbeliever if I managed to live a moral life. Im not saying this makes faith pointless but it renders faith alone for the sake of getting rewarded with an afterlife pointless because faith alone wouldnt matter in the first place. If anything this would be an argument to act as moral as possible. An Atheist has knowledge of the deity they dont believe in unless theyve been brought up as an atheist which is a completely different scenario. So I think its fair for an atheist to speculate on what would happen to him if hes wrong which is a possibility. This would  with our current understanding of how God is supposed to work  probably lead to God allowing said Atheist into heaven if they did indeed act in a way thats in line with Christian morality. if we dont know the deity beforehand it becomes fairly hard  almost impossible  to please them unless the deity itself is pretty lenient. In this case Pascals Wager falls flat because you couldnt tell whether faith will give you the reward PW promises you in the first place.  gt I agree that the moral teachings of religions are probably reflections of the ideals of the era but that doesnt mean the framework religion can provide is useless. By placing ethics into certain religious frameworks you create a certain lens through which you can examine the interplay of the moral itself and metaphysical ideas.It isnt useless per se. It comes with so much baggage though that abandoning it might be more beneficial in the long run. We could also look at ethics through a secular lens which has created a much more humane environment.gt Morality is intrinsically metaphysical. Nature has no morals. By removing metaphysics from morality you remove the basis for morality itself. Sure you can try to rationalize certain moral behaviors like not murdering people in purely scientific terms  murder is bad for the species survival and should therefore be avoided  but such analysis is shallow because it falls flat on its face when confronted with a pointless existence. If there is no divinity or soul or afterlife or whathaveyou then the survival of a species means nothing. Its all random and may as well not exist. Enjoy the ride because youre here if you want or just die because there isnt a point. And if life has no point then the way you live your life is equally pointless meaning morality is wholly unnecessary.Well so what if life is pointless? We still have to live through it. We as human beings are able to give our lives meaning by ourselves. We dont need an external agent for this. Religious morality will always put God in the center. Secular or atheist morality fills the void created by the nonrelevance or nonexistence of god with happiness. Morality is needed to allow for the greatest happiness of the greatest number of people possible. Utilitarianism makes no reference to any deity yet creates a moral system in which Christianitys secular moral standards are held up as well.  gt Or you can choose to say that there might be a soul divinity etc. And this is where the more esoteric readings of various scripture comes into play big time it provides a more sophisticated framework for testing morals within the context of certain metaphysical concepts than surface level readings of scripture can allow for.I fail to see how the concept of a soul or divinity is needed here. gt Yes its sad that so many religions actively discourage thinking. There are many good things that religious organizations have done and currently do charity community but also many bad things. Part of what Ive hoped to communicate in this conversation is that the way organized religion tends to operate today is not the story of religion throughout all history nor does the present state of religion need to define its future.Would the organizations do the same thing if their religion was to be proven pure fiction? I doubt it. Charity and community have no intrinsic connection to religion and faith. ,entp,d7acv18,1,t5_2qoy3

9329966,0,t1_d8yjfmh,gt Investments in the context of the modern economy turn such decision making mechanisms into financial instruments. This allows different people with different present constraints goals for the future and beliefs about the world to place their bets on outcomes for the future.Admittedly I havent formally studied much economics so Im not sure on whether this question is answered at some point... but do we have any evidence that investments genuinely do make the economy smarter as you claim? The way youre describing the system here is that you have a farmer focused on the daytoday concerns of his crops and then you have some investors who are completely removed from the farming process making bets on the outcomes of the farming industry... Why would making guesses about someone elses work like that ever actually contribute to a better economy? Capitalism operates on supply and demand and farmers will quickly notice when the supply of their product exceeds the demand and switch accordingly. Why do we need investors saying everyone move your money to tomatoes! If people start buying tomatoes then the farmers will notice. Through my uneducated bias it just seems as though the service sector was formed by greedy elitists who figured out they could turn guesses into money. Without actually knowing how to farm they make money off of betting on farmers and its a legal and even admired professionwtf. gt In an economy we all benefit from a mechanism where we sit down analyze available evidence and think rationally about what things we should prioritize over other things? Should we dig up more gold or more copper? Should we plant more corn or more coffee?I think were disagreeing on how critical this mechanism is though. I agree that having analysts could potentially be beneficial but Im just trying to say that its not necessary. All the crap about how people need to sit in cubicles  days a week and handle  hour workweeks watching numbers on a screen go by if they want to earn a living wage is just wrongwe do not have to be working this hard because those jobs are just not producing anything for the economy. Its helpful for some people to analyze available evidence but the majority of humans dont need to be doing this. Again Im not saying people should be banned from having these jobs Im just saying that its really not integraland that there were PLENTY of thriving economies on this Earth before the stock market was invented.gt Doesnt really work that way for several reasons. First different employees have different specialties.. they arent necessarily interchangeable. Second some people just become unuseful entirely. Third a company exists to generate profit not to keep people employed.. Yes but again the specialized jobs are the ones that arent as critical as say bus drivers. All our economy should really be doing is making sure the critical jobs are filled which imo is everything thats not service sector and then anyone who wants to do the other stuff can do it if they want but for the most part socalled lowlevel jobs are definitely mostly interchangeable. Ie factory workers coal miners janitors etc. But again we do not NEED anything above that level.. Aha this word unuseful is relevant to how you see work ethic as relevant to human value... I have this argument with my dad all the time because he honestly believes no one should be given anything free from the government without having put in work and that you cant give people something for doing nothing. Im the perfect opposite I think that just being alive and human is sufficient for you to deserve resources I dont think that completing arbitrary economic analysis tasks makes your life any more valuable than that of the hobo on the park bench actually. But I suppose this comes down to philosophical differences.. Well this is another philosophical difference because I suppose at the root of it I dont see a companys purpose as to make profit. I dont really comprehend this idea of just get more money because what is your endgame there? You can buy more things ok but after a certain point does that really matter? You can pass it on to your kids but again after a certain level of money theyre just going to put it all into investments and then never see the money again. And then of course you run into values problems of having created a system where people who decided to go into business vs. say teaching get to decide how the economy works rather than the people who are responsible for training kids on how to survive in that economy thereby rigging the game always towards businesses. I believe teachers contribute far more to directly impacting society than some entrylevel consultant but the latter is going to make far more money even after years of teaching. Anyways my point is that there are many other purposes companies could have other than profit and besides I think it should be the role of the government to direct the economy to best serve the peoples needs. Really our  primary goal of all companies right now should be building a sustainable economy rather than a profitable one because our planet is being bled dry in the name of this amorphous profit idea which to me seems like an odd goal. Maybe its my INFPness but I dont see how anyone believes that maximizing your own selfinterest at the expense of everyone around you could ever possibly lead to a fulfilling existence.gt In the US this is a consequence of a difficulty in us agreeing on exactly how much help someone really needs and how to make sure we arent wasting excessive resources in the process of providing that assistance. Additionally there a lot of social and psychological factors that play into the issue of poverty.. its not entirely economical.Yes and in the US we particularly suck at redistributing our resources haha. The economic idea I feel most fondly towards is a universal basic incomebasically everyone makes a minimum living wage just for existing and if you want any luxuries whatsoever you go get a job. This would mean completely scrapping the entire welfare program because everyone would just have enough money and if you dont spend it right sorry. The only issue with it is how we deal with kids with shitty parents who would spend their money recklessly but thats sadly always an issue regardless of the welfare system were on. There are social and psychological factors yes which is particularly why the whole pull yourself up by the bootstraps idea doesnt resonate well with me... Sure its easy to go through college and get your nice job at Goldman Sachs if you work decently hard and your daddy has serious connections but if youre a kid who grows up in a trailer park you automatically have an incredibly low shot of pulling that off. And its really not fair to say anyone not rich just needs to work harder when again a lot of wealth comes from privilege and again you can work EXTREMELY hard as a teacher source my life and yet make far less than someone at Goldman Sachs who is probably also working hard to be fair but if Im also working  hour weeks to get all my shit done then our compensation should be at least equal. And like Ive said teachers are actually much more critical to the functioning of society than someone who is doing say financial analysis.Again I just think capitalism has both been inefficient at deriving an effective way to distribute its resources justly and at being able to lessen our workload in accordance with our progress. It makes NO sense that we are adding more and more jobs each year when technology is cutting more and more jobs. We just need to like... chill... we could do it if we wanted. Our food production is almost totally autonomous. We could just you know spend time with our families and on our hobbies and work  hours a week analyzing economics instead of . ,entp,d8yn3c3,1,t5_2qoy3

9444922,0,t1_d9d6ip8,gtThats why checks and balances exist. Idk how the German government works but a lot of the work the Supreme Court does is protection of minorities and social issues.Its similar here but has nothing to do with my original argument which centers around direct democracy which is a system that is neither in place in the US nor in Germany. Both countries governments are limited by the nature of their constitutions. Checks and balances exist exactly because any concentration of power will inevitably lead to authoritarian tendencies. gt In the case of the UK public voting to leave the EU Im not sure what that has to do with minorities being negatively affected. Unless you count economic occupations and lawyers as minorities hahaThe UK referendum was just the latest and most controversial example of direct democracy at work even though thats technically not fully correct as the UK government isnt legally obliged to follow the referendums outcome. Think about this way In a direct democracy in which the majority of the populace gets to decide policy it is fairly easy to ignore civil rights. Take gay marriage  in a direct democracy it would a completely democratic law to outlaw any sort of LGBT rights if a majority votes for it. Or taking away voting rights from the black community. Under mob rule this is legitimate. This is where a constitution or any other legal code comes in. A constitution is in most cases drafted by a group of people who were given the power to do so by the populace. In many cases this national assembly is elected. In a direct democracy having a constitution or having checks and balances isnt really that desired. Why should it be? If the people are governing themselves there is no need to create checks and balances because the decision of the majority is always justified.  In my original comment the one youve responded to I also mentioned that IMHO the British government should ignore the referendum if there is proof that Brexit will be disastrous for the country in the long run if said proof is univocally provided by economic and sociopolitical experts. Sometimes reasonable decisions are unpopular and sometimes those decisions need to be made.The concrete argument against the Brexit referendum would be that it undermines parliamentary democracy. Also the conditions of an exit werent clear before the referendum took place. The current debate about whether Britain should do a hard or soft Brexit reflects this. This very issue was virtually absent from any greater discussion on the issue before the referendum took place. Neither Leave nor Remain talked concrete solutions yet the people ate it up and voted for it. Now theyll demand that the UK will leave the union no matter what. A second referendum wouldnt be possible though because it would nullify the outcome of the first one.   ,entp,d9d7lml,1,t5_2qoy3

You are a CroMagnon.You say INTPs are lean mean ideaprocessing machines. and from one perspective this is true and from another perspective it is false.If you compare Xeelee roughly analogous to INTP with Angel roughly analogous to ENTP at the  polarity then yes Xeelee is more concerned with ideas and Angel is more concerned with people. If you compared them at the  polarity then Xeelee is entirely mindless and Angels are intellectuals.Overall your stupid little comparison contains no more truth than this tiny fraction of a table I made two days agoXeelee  Strategic Command.Angel  National Center for Supercomputing Applications.Time Lord  Navy.The navy plays stupid games and is completely useless.It was a fun table to construct ... all  of them.

9816611,0,t3_5fu9g0,So life starts out simple. Theres actually theories that the world has its basis in RNA rather than DNA. So we have some simple things such as viruses etcNow we move to nice happy single cell organisms such as our lovely bacteria archaebacteria and eubacteria. Eventually some cells became friends with other cells and kind of became more complex eukaryotic cells and swallowed up each other and made these cool organelles. This is an oversimplification of how things such as the chloroplast and mitochondrial came to be.So at this point we have all of our single called organisms.gtDo you think thats because it took that long for cells to mutate and develop more diverse generic code to allow adaptations and evolution into more complex life forms?Well its not only that but its also exactly that. Yes things have to mutate to allow communication and for the process of multicellularism to exist but think of how complex and risky that is. You have to communicate and work with others. You have to share and divert energy. Other pets will now affect you. How do you transfer nutrients information decide how to share these things? Its energetically more costly. On the other hand once things become multicellular we can have specialization and life can go on even after one cell dies. So yes these random mutations had to happen but then they also had to work and spread and be more advantageous.gt do you think the loss of bio diversity has negatively affected the evolution of life in some ways? Loss of biodiversity allows blooms in biodiversity. If there was never that massive extinction of dinosaurs mammals likely would never have flourished. Things can only take over a niche if its empty or it can out compete. The world is meant to contain struggles. Without strife evolution wouldnt happen.gtHow different would life be if those great extinctions  never took place?  Do you think life would be even more advanced  than it is now?  Would it just be more specialized?  Do we have any idea of what would happen? So I think what you have to think about is these extinctions didnt make evolution go back to zero. It just made the best adapted animals at the time survive and gain control. Mammals would likely not be as prevalent. So sharks appeared before us but theyre still here because theyre awesome at life. Same with horseshoe crabs yeast bacteria. They are also all still evolving. Just because new things develop there are advantages to them still existing. Theyre evolutionary tree is still branching off just as we are.Those animals that existed would continue to evolve we cant predict how they would have changed or what life events would effect them. There have been several mass extinctions. Who knows if others would have evolved to have been as advanced as humans. Part of what allowed us to be successful is a higher metabolism from being a warm blooded mammal. But anyways if that last extinction didnt knock a bunch out something else would have. Some natural disaster some disease. Who knows. Think about all the forest fires etc we control. One good drought and a fire could knock out half of a continent if it was extreme enough. ,entp,dan4f7p,4,t5_2qoy3

Lets say the small amount of electricity I have created heat that met atmospheric molecules and changed its composition. Electrons have mass even if ridiculously minuscule. This ridiculous mediocre insignificant amount of Mass is responsible for everything I do. I just had another weird thought we like to think of electrical circuits as Hard wired its a very physical tangible idea but things arent really even solid. Some matter is more conductive than others but everything in existence has an electrical charge on some level. Our technological pursuit employs primitive technology anchored in metals. Yet the most powerful electricity in nature occurs non physically through friction. Our lungs perform a very interesting process converting inhaled oxygen to carbon dioxide. Our bodies bind carbon to oxygen molecules as a by product our our respiratory system. Who is to say when we die a similar process doesnt occur that we cant visually witness.How to prove?

So yeah when a defense mechanism becomes counterproductive and unhealthy it is a problem. What I can agree with is that some people will think youre intellectualizing even though youre not and youre simply not that emotional and already made peace with your inner feelings for example.Like you know typically these movies scenes when a cop has to shoot and kill someone and then he has all these annoying appointments with a shrink to figure out how ok he really is.Im pretty sure it wouldnt affect my sleep or mental health one bit and explain to him rationally why it doesnt yet that shrink might think Im in denial and attempt to help me out with it.,entp,dd40b5f,1,t5_2qoy3

So when they were playing volleyball me and my bestfriend played basketball with the dudes. I also was in the swimming team of the school when I was like  but I didnt do it long enough to know how good I was. It was mostly because the swimming practise ended late in the evening and my parents were worried and stuff. Now I am  years old kind of chubby but Ive been working out and loving it.

You always need a casebycase breakdown to make any ethical decision. Lets do a little breakdown of the  most popular ethical theoriesKantian ethics Definitely not permissible since it violates another persons autonomy and cant be universalized.Virtue ethicsDefinitely not permissible since your intent is selfish if not malicious. i.e. a person of virtue would not do it.Consequentialism UtilitarianismUnclear. Permissible in some cases not permissible in others. Definitely the wrong move if the other person finds out you manipulated them. Probably wrong most of the time. Its worth mentioning that manipulation is a wholly selfish thing. Its only for your benefit and then additionally it can lead to a sick mindstate where the manipulator feels empowered from having control over another person not a good thing. It also might cause a psychological divide between you and the other person because you are dishonest with them. In terms of laymans ethics I think we can say dont do morally sketchy things purely for your benefit. ,entp,deld8xd,5,t5_2qoy3

11153103,0,t3_5z7znh,gt Do you find that you are able to predict the motives of people with uncanny accuracy once you start a sentence with them?Predict the motives?  What does that mean?  The motive is the intent the cause that comes before what you observe.  Do you mean anticipate their behavior?  Or infer their motives from their behavior?The former is usually a NiFe thing because they substitute an unknowable motive with what they assume to be the motive Ni and extrapolate behavior Fe from that.  Effectively they use their own subconscious  model to gauge everyone elses future behavior.  If theyre good at it then INFJs are insightful.  Otherwise....Inferring motives means working backwards from what people dosay to what prompted them to dosay it.  This is more of a Fi or even Ti thing.  Again with Fi it depends on the accuracy of the internal model.  If Fi is warped then it can attribute false intentions to all observations.  Example The only reason hes nice to me is because he wants to have sex with me.So INFJs as long as their Ni is screwed on properly can quickly predict actions NiFe based on intuition and secondarily analyze and confirm that their hunch was right by examining the result TiSe.Thats the primary dynamic of the INFJ stack NiFe ltgt TiSe  Suddenly know what people are going to do next and then realize Ti upon seeing what they actually do Se the likely particular reasons that prompted it which goes back into refining their Ni completing the cycle.For ENTPs  FeSi first notices something is wrong someone looks or sounds sad their behavior is different. But unlike an INFJ hunch which is really a constellation of subconscious observations it will be something more tangible you notice your girlfriend is on the floor crying.

Like when people usually tell me stories I remember it to a ridiculous level.Anyways because of this I get really annoyed when someone tells me Im wrong or details dont add up even if its incredibly stupid it will keep bugging me. This actually occurred yesterday over something stupid. This girl wanted to take the subway into the city and was super confused and wanted all the details including where to pay. I dont ride the subway in but did once with ISTJ and so I told her the pay station was on the platform. Someone came by then and explained it more but mentioned paying on the train. And it just super bugged me. I also didnt want to give wrong info to someone who was nervous about it. Anyways later confirmed with ISTJ that for popular stations you pay on the platform unpopular stations as you enter. It was just a stupid example of a detail I knew but needed to confirm. ,entp,dey343n,1,t5_2qoy3

11206653,0,t3_5zy38x,I do enjoy anime quite a lot I see it as a medium which can explore vast amount of ideas we dont tend to see often in the western or regular media. In regards of genres Im really not TOO picky if it has a nice concept or a good storydevelopment i will at least give it a try but in general I enjoy comedy the smart kind of not the suddenly boobs on the face of male lead just because boner but even if its goofy humor i like that too sometimes I need to abandon all this overthinking and TOO serious things and fuck around thrillers shounen seinen psychological or alikes are always welcome with something that has the potential to fuck my mind and bend it over. Among my favorites noncomedy focused animes are danganronpa and the games even more so death note steinsgate btoom code geass and surely something more but that just to establish a bit my point. In very sporadically occasions I can enjoy some romance in animes usually those that are not focused on it but it has that theme in there if it has a more mature approach to it instead of the fantasy setting of romanticism made to the imagination of a teenager.I also dislike the mecha animes it just really doesnt appeal to me the idea of robots fighting is like to a degree a fight without risk and too often it feels like more a fantasy than a scifi,entp,df29en7,1,t5_2qoy3

The expectation to go to college at  is bullshit. I was floundering at  all what is this shit? why am I in a dorm? who are these people? what is this environment I find myself in? It was uncomfortable. After taking a total of a little more than a year off school I still dont totally know if Im on the right track. Ive had six majors. Six. That means five of those didnt pan out and I just have all this college credit that doesnt fulfill any requirement. I did the whole bouncing between community colleges. Honestly that was probably the best part. But it was such a mistake to go straight into college after high school. I even took some summer school course between the two to try to qualify for some scholarshipended up failing that calc class real hard. Bye bye .I got over the embarrassment at some point.

Although I am aiming to eventually make a decent amount of money off my artwork in the meantime working a lowlevel job gives me much more freedom to actually pursue it.

True crying about things never helps the situation... but crying doesnt always mean that you wont get off your ass and do something. I cry. When things get to me I cry. Theres something about just acknowledging the fact that yeah this is tough and just letting myself go that gives me a lot of clarity later to fight back much harder.I think expressing or acknowledging emotions is a healthy way to deal with them. But it only works if you make sure that you actually DO something apart from just crying your eyes out. Tears only help you get the sadness out of your system they dont help you achieve things.

To answer  C. The pod malfunctioned due to a growing cascade failure. Having been assured that the margins for failure were so astronomically small Id likely have assumed something was very wrong. Assuming the crew is inaccessible which is stupid and communication with earth near impossible which is implausible Id be forced to choose from the other passengers so I would try to find the most qualified persons  to help identify and repair the problem. Id explain to them the situation as best I could and that insuring the survival of the other people was of greater importance than the lives of two or three people. Assuming we gain similar knowledge to the characters in the movie wed be able to solve the problems and in the end have access to the autodoc. Supposing three people had been woken and survived repairing the ship we could take turns at periods of cryosleep.

11721702,0,t1_dgo553p,This is something that Im coming to realize as well. My ex claimed that he didnt want to tell me some hard stuff in our relationship because he didnt want to hurt my feelings but I think a big part of it was also that he didnt want to deal with the potential fallout of whatever it was that he needed to say. It was easier to put the blame on me being too sensitive instead of just telling me whats on his mind because he didnt want to deal with the emotional burden of coming across like an asshole and possibly upsetting me. ,entp,dgooo5a,5,t5_2qoy3
