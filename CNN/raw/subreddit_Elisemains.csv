5600197,0,t3_3rsxln,Hey! Elise has really healthy clears meaning she can get along without needing purple smite. The blue smite will help you chase and escape and provide a little extra damage.,Elisemains,cwr9ald,2,t5_38dyq

8175357,0,t3_4r8n9x,Personally I build Rylais and Abyssal every game as my core. From there you can go full AP if youre carrying usually Void and dcaplichbane or FH and SV if you want to go tank.For team fights in my experience the two most effective things you can do is flash cocoon the backline and try to get a kill or force them to flash out or if they have a dive compassassins cocoon whoever tries to kill your adc and murder them.,Elisemains,d4zgwmh,2,t5_38dyq
8497572,0,t3_4w1a6l,In regards to elise even tho its well known that she falls of later in the game she still remains one of the best duelists due to the fact that she has pretty good percent health and percent missing health burst as well as the fact that her spiders and aa in spider form give good DPS along with healing.I personally dont really like protobelt on elise and I dont see many pros building it at all I opt for runic echos usually challenging smite followed by rylai and either sorc or CDR boots although less CDR now that there is more CDR in items. If I want more dmg and am ahead or enemy team has good Mr Ill get abyssal since Elise thrives off of mpen its way more valuable on her than flat ap then Ill go tank depending on the other teams damage armor options are dead mans or randuins randuins if they have a lot of crit and spirit visage for mr the bonus healing does wonders for your passive. So my usual build will look something like runic echos rylai abyssal sorcCDR randuins visage. Now about the squishyness if u want you can start taking strength of the ages on her tbh the higher I climbed the more I like it over TLD although both are really good with her and you cant go wrong. But with a few items especially in the mid game you do more damage than god himself and should be able to v most anyone so long as youre not super behind. The trick on her is you need to apply early game pressure out the ass and then if your lanes are ahead hit that farm life and come out of the jungle with rylai echos and two shot the ADC. Now very early you may be squish when ganking so watch out when ganking high dmg laners like Leblanc. A bit later on with this build not many people will be able to v you or burst u down. Hope that helped and dont hesitate to ask any other questions.,Elisemains,d63qxeu,1,t5_38dyq
8701884,0,t1_d6qsrnl,You shouldve tried Elise back in the beginning of season . Dont complain about Elise right now being nerfed into the ground when shes in an amazing spot.,Elisemains,d6td9kx,1,t5_38dyq
9594561,0,t1_d9vpqu8,Thanks a lot. Ive only played Vi so far because it was so much fun and went so well  S already so I havent come around playing my other main Elise but Im really looking forward to it since I saw this post.,Elisemains,d9vq543,1,t5_38dyq
10002250,0,t3_5istrj,Elise scales very well with AP the idea that AP sucks on her is an outdated one from multiple seasons ago. If you can afford to be squishy on her now then full AP is absolutely the way to go  the reason you dont see full squishy Elise most of the time is that doing so is very risky so you usually want bulk. The only spells Elise has with poormediocre AP scaling are her Qs dont underestimate her scaling in general because Volatile Spiderling is disgusting with AP and her DPS goes off the charts with it too. Just make sure you have enough defensive items whether that be  or several to survive because you cant put out any damage if youre exploding at the start of every fight.I do personally very much like AP bruiser items on her I find Abyssal  Hourglass  any APHP item makes an excellent defensive core that allows her to do her job. I wont generally get any items without defensive stats except Runic Echoes and Boots but at the same time  I really dont like to get any items without AP either. Its too good on her. I much prefer getting several items that mix damage and bulk rather than a couple of damage items and a couple of bulky items.,Elisemains,dbbblgl,1,t5_38dyq

10597009,0,t3_5reu3m,Its my opinion that Elise is still one of the best junglers in the game. I also one trick her and have well over k mastery points top  NA just like you. I definitely understand how you feel though. There has been a change to the way you have to play Elise this season. No offense but in  and prior she was extremely busted and even bad Elise players could do extremely well. Strength of Ages compensated for her only weakness being squishy. It patched up the problems with her late game and it often gave you enough HP to be the difference between living and dying.She has become a champion that takes much more skill preparation and strategy to succeed. I feel that for the first time since her release she is balanced. Shes not op and she actually has some bad matchups now.Here is what I suggest if you want to get your mojo back. Analyze the game extremely hard in the first  minutes and find the lane you think will be most vulnerable to your early gank. Adjust your gank path according to what you lane you want to gank. One of Elises greatest strengths right now is her ability to do many different gank paths and still end with full hp and clear quickly. Abuse your level  like theres no tomorrow. Barring extreme outplays the only champions that can beat you v in the jungle at level  are Xin and Vi. I invade almost every game at level . The nerfs to Lee Sin make it so that if you are even in levels he cant v you at any point in the game anymore.In the current meta champions that can gank bot early are extremely strong. Elise is unique in that she can pull off successful ganks bot whether its pushed to the enemy tower or pulled to your tower. She has literally  different gank paths to bot. The biggest change for me overall has been my build paths this season. I used to just take strength of ages then rush Runic  Proto  Rylais. After that I could consider getting some defensive stats. This season in certain matchups I will build an arm guard before I even finish runic. I also vary my boots buys more than I used to. It used to be unnecessary to buy anything other than Sorc boots. Now there are many situations where MercTabi are much better.While you are much less tanky this season everyone else is too. You can afford to build more defensive stats and still one shot people. Also Liandrys has become one of the strongest buys on Elise. You can v champions like Nautilus and Maokai more effectively than almost any other jungler in the game if you get an early Liandrys. Only buy protobelt now if you are very far ahead and they dont have a lot of AOE damage threats or a fed assassin.I actually have around a  winrate with Elise in solo queue this season. The  is from drunk flex queue with my bad friends xD. ,Elisemains,dd900c9,1,t5_38dyq
11150556,0,t1_deuy1lo,On certain champs it can be hard to figure out how to translate your lead into macro plays. On Elise though especially in Bronze where games are super volatile its important to try to push your lead as much as you can into objective control. The problem with Elise in Bronze is that she specializes in killing people safely. Thats a problem for Bronze because people make so many mistakes that you really dont need what Elise offers.Characters that snowball much harder tend to just be flat out better than her in low elo. Yi is an example of a character that is actually not that great overall but that is probably top tier in Bronze. You shouldnt be able to get safe kills with him but because people make so many mistakes and give up kills for no reason he can snowball just about as well as Elise and he can do so much more with the snowball.Possibly consider getting another main until you hit Gold ish. To properly hard carry in Bronze you probably need to play something that can more or less v in team fights or split push extremely well. Try stuff like Hecarim Riven any ADC Yasuo etc... Avoid assassins with no AOE. The assumption of assassins is that your team is good enough that if you eliminate a player from the enemy team you win the fight automatically. The problem is in Bronze games very often they will have someone multiple people on their team with  kills and the rest of your team will be like xxlarge number. You need something that can just stomp a whole team when played well.,Elisemains,devwjcl,1,t5_38dyq
11161281,0,t3_5zbbax,I see most people running AS reds now.  However if you want to run Pen marks I feel like Magic Pen will give you better results than Hybrid.  Thats my opinion though so take it with a grain of salt.,Elisemains,dex4b0z,1,t5_38dyq
11786029,0,t3_683vyn,Well ok thats a good guide for challenger players.Not for low elo though.,Elisemains,dgvzhnj,1,t5_38dyq
