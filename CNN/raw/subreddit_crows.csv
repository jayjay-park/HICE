7818876,0,t3_4mepyl,This guy was trying to swim in a pond large pond behind my house but I can see he was having a hard time so I pulled him out. Upon further inspection I believe he is just a fledgling. I think crows are really cool and want to keep him. But I dont know where to begin. Such as food and proper housing. Please help,crows,d3uwndk,1,t5_2v45o
