9028517,0,t1_d4mkugr,Im looking to buy a few cuttings and a larger segment. Its says on your site that you only accept bitcoins and cash. Well Im gonna choose the cash option. Can I use a money order instead? I just dont trust sending cash in the mail. Its not that I dont wanna trust you its that I dont trust people that handle my mail.  Im sure youre not a doucher. Just have  feeling. Now if money order wont work I guess I can send cash. But Id have a lot less heebs about the whole process that way.,SanPedroShop,d7x33eb,1,t5_3chfx
