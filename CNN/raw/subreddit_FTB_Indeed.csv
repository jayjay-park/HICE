1709488,0,t3_2dycuk,Oh this sounds fantastic  Great work imwearEdit The only suggestion I would have is maybe to have an option of more than thirty seconds spawning time. Maybe have two options one for thirty seconds and the other  minutes?,FTB_Indeed,cjun5d2,2,t5_2y6ss

1951713,0,t3_2h10ox,Ive been watching Bevo play that pack on Twitch looks like great fun. At present we have the DNS and BTP MINI packs running. Ceruza is working on a custom pack that I think will replace DNS. As far as I know he isnt even adding IC as its been a pain for us with hosting. ,FTB_Indeed,ckodvg7,1,t5_2y6ss
