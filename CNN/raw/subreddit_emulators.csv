5917896,0,t3_3wbmvo,Most emulators need a genuine ps BIOS to run games  the legit method requiring mild modding of an original console to obtain. I cant think of any emulators that DONT read iso files and it sounds like youre new to ps emulation so basically if you cant get a BIOS you will probably struggle to play any game regardless of emulator used. Plenty of websites host BIOS files online somewhere but I dont know if discussing where to get them is strictly forbidden on this subreddit or not. PCSX is the most commonly recommended emulator it is the most compatible one out there and for the bios Google is likely your best bet. Hope this helped.,emulators,cxvd8la,1,t5_2t5a2
