9912252,0,t3_59zkxr,Hello I recently ordered a rather large amount of MK from irc.bio in powder form for my spider cricket with his IGF initially being  prior to dosing. Hes been taking it in mg of powder measured with an electronic scale before bed not creating a solution for it as I read this was fine to do  days on  days off for a solid month now. The current blood test shows his IGF at  so its gone down a little. The question I have is is he dosing it incorrectly by just taking it in via powder form or did I receive something other than MK? My spidey senses tell me its something hes doing wrong as IRC.bio seems to be a trusted site and this is his first rodeo in this sort of thing and I can definitely say what hes been taking is not a prohormone because theres  performance increase while on it.It doesnt taste very good which is traditional of MK. My spider cricket does get a bit of a heart rate from taking it but thats about it and maybe tired  lethargic. No increased appetite no numb hands no changes in skin or sleep. None of the things hes supposed to get. If anyone could shed some light on this it would be much helpful. I tried to reach out to IRC.bio but all I got was a generic this is how you create a solution message assuming thats all they can say over email without getting themselves into trouble. I appreciate any help in advance.,sarmsourcetalk,dazl8kw,2,t5_3fzcj
