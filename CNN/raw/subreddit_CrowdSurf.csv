739779,0,t1_cgocknq,Is it really more flexible? Sure we wont have to do it every day but now we will have to work four times as much. Im turking every day anyway. This trade off is not worth it. I just cant afford to do them in volume anymore. The new tier system is good and all but you also dramatically decreased the payout.,CrowdSurf,cgod8d0,1,t5_2zgze
1520972,0,t1_cj5y427,Nothing I guess. I was just noticing that the majority of the traffic on rcrowdsurf is unsurprisingly crowdsurfrelated. Didnt know if the lack of CV mentions is due to the crowdsurf name or just general lack of interest. I guess theres also a third possibility  lack of CV workers being on reddit.,CrowdSurf,cj6xj2m,1,t5_2zgze
1752057,0,t1_cjzzupo,There is a note on their website that its based both on need and quality. Maybe there is just not a need now. Sometimes there is hardly any work except late at night. You could always send them an email. ,CrowdSurf,ck006sl,1,t5_2zgze
1797476,0,t1_ck5owns,Yeah Ive gotten maybe  today I got a lot of the . ones with the doctor complaining about the health care system which were easy. Mondays are usually busy so its mostly today that Im worried about but I get what youre saying theres no guarantee there will be work tomorrow.,CrowdSurf,ck5pxt0,2,t5_2zgze

1937154,0,t1_ckmkoxb,No I received a  early in the day yesterday. It was on one that I reviewed twice before submitting. I was basically testing the scoring at that point and Im sure it had no errors. Im not new at transcribing or at reviewing.My scores are all over the place. I think Im going to stay away until I hear from CrowdSurf. ,CrowdSurf,ckmm9yl,5,t5_2zgze

2502776,0,t1_cmk3xy5,Thanks for the input. A year or so ago I received a link to a Crowdsurf Virtual Feedback google document. However this link rarely works. I am doing beta HITS but cant find feedback that specifically tells me what errors I made. I can only find my Average QC Score. Im interested to see what errors I make so I wont continue to make them. ,CrowdSurf,cml91hu,1,t5_2zgze
2513634,0,t3_2odoy3,Honestly I dont even pay a bit of attention to my score anymore. I can go days straight with a solid . and then within a few hours randomly go down to . or lower. Im not the one changing so its clearly not me. As long as I dont lose my qualification theres not much I am really concerned about at this point. ,CrowdSurf,cmmo5bh,2,t5_2zgze

2953023,0,t3_2tzldi,Hello I am sorry to hear that CrowdSurf is causing you stress. We are catching up on emails today after releasing the new CrowdSurfWork platform. So if you could point us in the direction of any incorrect reviewers we would appreciate it.On the other hand we have plenty of Full Text Review jobs for you to work on and we would love it if you could log in and help us manage the volume of work in FTR. Please let us know if there is anything else that we can help you with! Youre a valuable member of the CrowdSurf team and we would hate to lose you.Thanks!,CrowdSurf,co3rtpl,2,t5_2zgze

3033339,0,t1_cocd52p,Agreed.  I used to do the same thing. Also FTR is the ONLY task type that does this.  Every other task type including special handling I believe lets you submit in a smaller amount of time than the media length for the task.Note that this isnt viable on all tasks but for the dream material one speaker talking slowly and clearly its quite easily doable to finish a min task in say  min.Id say just let us speed through FTR tasks and let the QC scores speak for themselves the people that sluff off or try to rush faster than their skill allows will get caught there anyhow.,CrowdSurf,cocejwo,2,t5_2zgze

3343759,0,t3_2ygygf,Is it one of the Australian ones? Aside from a bit of Yahoo Finance they are all I can get today and Im getting graded so harshly on them.. I wish reviewers could soften up a bit! I dont feel like a hit deserves a bad score unless its missing multiple words or really bad spelling or something. But to get  errors all for tiny stuff like missing a single uh amongst  other uhs and ums. Just discouraging.,CrowdSurf,cp9ew23,2,t5_2zgze
3678811,0,t3_32i1yf,The change happened back when Crowdsurf updated to the new layoutI want to say a few months ago? It loads more quickly than the old HITs and we get paid more. But the inability to skip over certain sets of audio is one of the only complaints I have about it. Whether theres another reason for that is a question for uCrowdsurfsupport. I seem to remember them saying that this is on their list of what to change but I cant find the post.,CrowdSurf,cqblxar,1,t5_2zgze
3742936,0,t3_3392t6,Rarely if Im transcribing a really fast speaker who enunciates clearly the slow speed works out better because I dont have to use the shortcuts to pause the video. That doesnt happen very often though. For the most part I stick to the regular speed to keep things safe because words sometimes sound like different words when they are slowed down. The other day I tried out the novice setting again  the one where it pauses and reverses slightly to replay some of the audio as it progresses. Eeesh  that didnt work out so well. I gave up and went back to the normal speed after attempting about  hits. Keeping multiple tabs open to load the next hit while working on another is useful for when the hits take longer than  seconds to load. Ill stick to only one hit at a time when they are running faster. When Im not sure how to spell an unusual term or name of something Ill attempt to type out my best guess and complete the transcript before looking it up. Sometimes Crowdsurf has entered the mysterious term in their spellchecker and its just matter of doing a quick search on Google to verify that it is indeed the term Im trying to find and linked to the same subject. Even when I have to do the detective work on my own I find its easier for me to finish the transcript first because I get into a better rhythm or flow.Really finding a rhythm or flow helps me the most as far as production. Without it Im always getting sidetracked in between each one! Ill also wait to check out what Im dinged for on my quality scores until after Im done for the day. Its too easy to get frustrated watching that stuff. ,CrowdSurf,cqix418,1,t5_2zgze
3775991,0,t1_cqlv3oi,Good point I totally forgot about the omitting zeroes but still if it was in the thousands Id probably have the same question. Hm.,CrowdSurf,cqmovr7,1,t5_2zgze
3842766,0,t3_34g2kd,Yeah I noticed some of my transcriptions have had a speaker change appear at the front too. Thought it was just a system bug or something,CrowdSurf,cqub51y,3,t5_2zgze
3851730,0,t1_cqv8bdb,The problem is though is not that people arent looking there. Its that the tip doesnt refresh until you finish and get a new task.   Its not that  min of warning isnt enough.  Its plenty.  But if you throw the warning up people dont see that unless they finish their task and get a new one which drastically cuts the perceived warning people are receiving especially if you are dealing out long tasks like the  minute FTRs out there this morning.  There are probably some cases where people dont see it at all because theyre taking awhile on a long task.  I mean I can get a  minute coding FTR done in  minutes and even I didnt see it until it went down this morning.  If youre doing QC or timing or Mturk then its not going to be as much of a problem its mostly FTR and QC Reject workers that are getting thrown by this.If there was something in the app that polled every minute to see if there was a new downtime notification that just came in and then displayed in real time without having to get a new job that would help tremendously.  Either that or give at least  hr of notice with the current setup if not more.,CrowdSurf,cqvbz9n,2,t5_2zgze
3954347,0,t1_cr6uwf1,Youve helped me in the past. Id like to ask your opinion. Is it worth it to go back and find where I got dinged for not using a SOUND tag during a programming segment and the speaker would pause in their speaking but there were noises of the keystrokes? I guess Im asking if it is worth it to email support over especially since theyre doing a huge review updatepurge. ,CrowdSurf,cr7129d,1,t5_2zgze
3980358,0,t1_cr9rmhx,This is still a little weird to me because technically speaking everything that can be marked as an error could be considered a guideline error on some level. Spelling error? Guidelines say to check your spelling. Missing or incorrect word? Guidelines call for verbatim transcript. Capitalization error? Guidelines address this et cetera. Now obviously those are all areas of common errors and it makes sense to choose the category that is most specificdescriptive of the error. Sometimes the choice will be a bit subjective. The handling of slang is covered specifically in the guidelines but even that is a bit odd gonnagoing to are both widely accepted as interchangeable in modern informal English. But using cuz as short of because is not. The only time I had ever seen cuz used before starting with CS was as a corruption of cousin in southern US slang and only rarely. So in my mind a going togonna error could probably properly be considered either a wrong word error or a guideline error but a becausecuz error could only be considered a guideline error since cuz is not a word. And in all cases specific guidance from CS overrules everything else and although I cant seem to find it right this minute I think somewhere CS may have stated that slang errors should be marked as guideline errors.,CrowdSurf,cr9zshz,1,t5_2zgze

4087176,0,t3_37em1f,Can I piggyback to ask about cartoons that feature songs as plot? Its not clear from guidelines or from what transcribers send up whether the lyrics should be written. Guidelines say to skip lyrics unless instructed or when in doubt. That seems reasonable for introtheme songs but when the episode is musical theres little left without lyrics. ,CrowdSurf,crm5w4u,1,t5_2zgze
4113613,0,t1_crp5ulw,I wont speak for CSW I was just talking about a note that is written in the note field for reviewers in Mturk. ,CrowdSurf,crp6ecc,1,t5_2zgze
4121313,0,t3_37v5ct,The one thing I notice that bad reviews never seem to have is comments. I also notice the same mistakes being made such as minor errors marked as major guesses changed being marked as major errors proper spellings being changed to improper spellings etc. Because these mistakes are being made over and over again compaints get made. Reviewers can protect themselves by using the provided comment box to explain why they made the changes they made. When I review I almost always explain myself with detailed explanation and I will sometimes provide a link to the guideline section I am referencing if I think there might be confusion.  ,CrowdSurf,crq1ze5,4,t5_2zgze
4121697,0,t3_37v8x4,As a reviewer Ive had a blast with the ones with that older gentleman with the crinkly little snack bag going Chomp chomp chomp is the mouse dead? while imitating alligators and kids.  I love that the transcriber made a good effort and it sounds clear enough to me to not count off for it.  But I think even if they had just put uuu I would not have counted off for it in that situation either. That was pretty tough.,CrowdSurf,crq3k1f,1,t5_2zgze
4136575,0,t1_crrh3pj,Yeah seems theres a lot of people out there that just dont understand the term. Maybe CS should rename it semiclean verbatim just remove flat out stutters and ums and uhs and let the rest be sweeped in FTR and whatnot. Maybe a cleanup review task. Problem is theres always so many HITs out there people wander in off the street looking to make a few bucks and dont really care or cant be bothered to check full instructions. Thank God Ive never been that way. Ive been doing CS on MTurk on and off for about . years and its changed a lot. But I have almost  HITs on MTurk and have only ever had  rejection good old Jon Brelig FTL. I try to be very careful with everything but not to the point its ridiculous like what were seeing with this stuff.,CrowdSurf,crrse6i,2,t5_2zgze
4153150,0,t3_38az6f,I would say if they are clearly as bad as you say then it is an example of fraud. The transcriber is trying to get away with doing subpar work as you say. It is intentional thus fraudulent. ,CrowdSurf,crto89j,2,t5_2zgze
