3011840,0,t1_co7qiv3,Well its redundant of me but I guess Ill repeat my earlier suggestion I think rfandomnatural is a lot more relevant than buffy and lost girl and enabling its discovery a little more would probably be beneficial for this sub since it provides easy access to an outlet for some of the material that just guessing youre not going to want here. If I were to make a comparison I would compare it to a steam valvekeeping it nice and open prevents the build up of pressure.Just my two cents.,SupernaturalTV,coa6bpz,1,t5_31dbj

3365815,0,t1_cpbwm2f,No not rude at all. I completely agree.gtCastiel is not my fav character and if they pit him against Dean that is going to split the fans a lot. I have seen fans make enormous irrational excuses for Dean just because they worship who can blame them Jensen Ackles. Misha has a load of fans as well. Gosh I hope they dont split the fandom into more fractures.Im not thinking so much pitting against each other as much as I am thinking about the cool tension thatd naturally arise between Castiel amp Dean postCrowleykill because Dean knows hes fateslated to kill Castiel next cue worry amp tension over a variety of circumstances where Dean amp Castiel must interact and Deans scared hell slip go MoC!Hulk amp kill Cas.To clarify I can see Dean killing Crowley amp then telling Castiel immediately that he has to gtfo amp Sam amp Cas are like wtf Dean no  we need Cas for whatever else were gonna do next! and then Dean has to relent amp feel that pressure amp fear of killing Castiel while working alongside him.I think something like that would generate some really fun drama amp tensionbuilding that both nonshippers shippers and plotlovers would probably eat right up I know I would! ,SupernaturalTV,cpbxf8i,3,t5_31dbj

3806287,0,t1_cqq4yk7,No youre confusing the difference between those who interpret canon and those who enjoy offcanon fiction.Lets be clear these are fictional characters. Any and all additional fiction beyond canon regarding romantic relationships are identified amp labeled in all fandom circles as offcanon. Its transformative fiction for a reason where characters are not only engaged in offcanon romantic relationships but also fly into space to meet aliens and visit alternate fictional universes like Harry Potter.If youre talking about canon interpretation  this?gtSupernatural explores the bond of friendship to a degree that very few other shows do and thats what makes it great.This is an interpretation. Its  valid and I completely respect it. But its not the only one. Its not the one that NEEDS respect any more or less than anyone elses. You need to recognize that youre not special. ...and my romance thing was about how romance doesnt get depicted as nearly as deep as the kind of platonic friendship thats been written into this show... and that thats pretty fucked up edit and so it makes sense why people want romance to come out of their relationships perhaps FINALLY we could all get a deep complex amp legitimate portrayal of a great romantic relationship versus the bullshit mainstream romances we keep getting spoonfed by asshole Hollywood execs that think formulaic drivel  the genre of romance altogether.,SupernaturalTV,cqq5aqx,2,t5_31dbj

3980288,0,t1_cr9fovi,Yeah Sam has probably been the most frustrating part of this season. I know theyve been through the whole theres something wrong with me and I dont want you to fix it deal before but Deans been pretty adamant about it all season. And it doesnt even seem like hes got good reasons for it. At least Cass brought up in this last episode that Dean would end up like Cain. It seems like Sams major motivation has just been not losing his brother which is sort of selfish when you think about it.,SupernaturalTV,cr9zi50,1,t5_31dbj

4034361,0,t3_36pzil,I liked it a lot. I have some issues with it though.For starters I feel less like I saw a natural storytelling evolution from the Mark of Cain to the Darkness and more a tremendous pitch from Team Carver for next season. Even with the mentions of biblical consequences for a few episodes it all feels... a bit sudden and rushed?I love that pitch I love the added lore but this MoC ending and the whole season  arc feels while not bad just strangely paced and ineffective to me  while there were great even fantastic moments even in the finale I was far more invested in Deans fate in season .Season  was a great idea but the execution wasnt entirely there like it needs to be. My thoughts and feelings on it all are still evolving but I feel pretty confident in saying that at least.,SupernaturalTV,crg5c1i,17,t5_31dbj
4161305,0,t3_37jda2,I think the opening scene will be Sam Dean and Cas back at the bunker talking about how to stop the Darkness. Then Crowley will pop in to help and hell briefly mention how he kicked the shit out of Cas last summer and made his escape.Then the story will progress as it always does. Darkness possesses people Sam and Dean kill the Darkness. There might be flashbacks of them trying to outrun that dark cloud if were lucky.From then on who knows?,SupernaturalTV,crulk7x,1,t5_31dbj
4204054,0,t1_crz86w6,ooo this plays into a little headcanon Ive been noodling around withKeeping the Darkness back with nothing but the Mark of Cain on  guy seems like a little... reckless on Gods part? I mean heres this megadestructive Creationconsuming threat and God locks it away with ONE little tattoo on ONE guy a tattoo that apparently is removable by a witch? Sure Rowenas a strong witch but its not like shes a goddess or anything. Witches traditionally have been lower leagues. Doesnt that seem like kind of a flimsy solution?My headcanon The Mark of Cain was originally intended to be just an emergency stopgap. God locked up the Darkness it was quite a battle he slapped the Mark on it in a big hurry as a stopgap gave it to Lucifer Hey man can you hold this for a sec? Its holding Creation together. Might make you feel a little weird  but youre my best and brightest you can handle it for a few days and Ill be right back and take it off soon I swear. All the while fully intending that it would just be for a few days or so. God then went off and devised a much better mechanism to keep the Darkness away an awesome spell or something maybe some kind of super well protected lockbox who knows. Point is he fully intended to come back and take the Mark off Lucifer Thanks sonny you did great!.But something went wrong. God didnt come back. One of my favorite ideas is that God was testing out the new Darknesscontaining lockbox and he accidentally locked himself inside it. ha ha ha! and hes been stuck inside ever since While developing the permanent much better designed Darknesscontaining mechanism something went wrong and God either damaged himself or locked most of himself away. Poor Lucifer had to carry the Mark much longer than intended and he got corrupted and fell and then Cain got the Mark and was corrupted too and then Dean. And all the while all of Creation has been teetering on the edge of destruction just held back by this flimsy little stopgap measure the Mark that was never intended to last this long. And meanwhile all God has been able to do semiblinded and semicrippled half stuck in that lockbox maybe is tweak things just a little bit nudge people sometimes... nudge Sam and Dean toward Lucifer hoping all along that theyd find the Mark and find God and get him out of the lockbox all so that the Darkness can finally be locked away for good.,SupernaturalTV,crzgamv,5,t5_31dbj
