10132427,0,t1_dbs80bp,If youd paid attention to my proposal overview video you would know that there will be no overhead wires or substations along the route as I have proposed that the hydrogen fuel cell powered Alstom Coradia iLint train set be used since it would allow for shared use of Union Pacific freight tracks in Wilmington which will save the city a lot of dough.Section Three of the flyovers would contain most of the maintenance and staff facilities most likely the operations and switching would take place at the now mostly countyowned although a small parcel would need to be purchased from the Union Pacific  I checked with them a while back former Southern Pacific rail yard near Fairbanks Avenue Between th and th Streets but there is additional ample area for such facilities in the industrial areas to the west of the LA River.There is opposition to everything including transit projects such as this.  From my research on previous boondoggles like you say the NIMBYs are generally a very tiny fraction of the population often representing disguised interests and always make the biggest racket out of everybody.  I would cite the Cheviot Hills section of the Expo line NIMBYs lost and the Orange line busway NIMBYs won as good examples of this.  The trick for overcoming this kind of opposition or at least my theory of how best to do so is to stick to the facts and not allow opposition to drag you down to mudslinging and instead aggressively reach out to the large majority of people who would support such a project and benefit from it but who do are not typically quick to become involved in local politics.  I would take a wild guess and say that about nine out of ten people I talk to will support me in this.  The other  will just be a lot louder.,longbeach,dbs9e50,2,t5_2rwpt
