5949734,0,t3_3wudp2,If you dont already have the nostalgia factor going for Xevious it will be lost on you.I can tell you exactly where I was when I first played it. I used to watch the older kids at the bowling alley in my town pile quarters into it to get further into the game. I would watch them for hours while my parents bowled in their league games.Now I play it on MAME sometimes because I think Hey! Xevious! and then Im bored within  minutes.But as far as the cabinet goes I think it has one of the best cabinet designs from the era. From the control panel to the side art to the monitor bezel to the back splash above the monitor it is pure s eye candy.Are you devious enough to beat Xevious?!,coinop,cxzjgnt,3,t5_2rug4

6849672,0,t1_d0smxfp,Im excited for the opening of Pins. Duck bowling can be loads of fun. But yeah  bit just gets too crowded to enjoy yourself. Im more of a Sunday pm patron there. I love happy hour at Level One though just enough of a crowd to be satisfying plus more pins than  bit. Old North is kinda janky but to be fair I got a bad impression when I first went it could be better now. ,coinop,d0spugt,1,t5_2rug4

7001521,0,t3_4bc9lj,I seem to remember a scene missing from this version of the game. Im pretty sure at least one of the levels had a boss fight where there was this soldier who was holding a woman as a meat shield in front of him and you had to shoot his face without hurting the woman,coinop,d19yteg,1,t5_2rug4
