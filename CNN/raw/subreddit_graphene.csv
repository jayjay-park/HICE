529269,0,t1_cg01ctw,Im on my phone but I can chime in quickly regarding the effective mass of fermions in graphene. In a standard semiconductor the electron in the valence babd and conduction band have parabolic shapes if you have no idea about band structures look up Brittany Spears solid state physics... Im serious. The mass of the fermions be they electrons or holes can be estimated from the curvature if these bands by using a form of the schrodinger equation. In graphene the symmetry if the symmetry gives a peculiar band structure that has a linear behavior near the Fermi level. Because of this linearity as well as a kink at the Fermi level the standard schrodinger  equation no longer applies. Instead this behavior can be modeled by the Dirac equation which is a relativistic version of the schrodinger equation. Giving the electron zero mass effectively yields linear bands traveling at a constant speed a value lower than the speed of light in this case. If you look up Wallace graphene band structure youll find a nice derivation of graphenes band structure from the s or s. This unique behavior is what gives graphene all this promise regarding its electronic properties. The oscillations are also very interesting but I dont have time to get into that now. Perhaps sidebar  items on the seminal papers on graphene would be helpful. ,graphene,cg0fnyf,3,t5_2s7gu

2481399,0,t3_2nwp6c,Its important to realize that most of the news stories on graphene are extremely exaggerated reports about small incremental scientific discoveries. There are still several severe engineering limitations to advancing any of graphenes  theoretical properties. Yes graphene has amazing properties which may one day revolutionize modern electronics. However Id take any story about a graphene technology coming to market in under  years with a large grain of salt. The only possible exception to this may be in graphene becoming a new phone  touchscreen material soon. ,graphene,cmiggzt,3,t5_2s7gu
