I have built one myself and have helped a few people on Reddit already and they all had good results so far.  TonyMac is a great place to start.  SingleMonad mentioned it.

1095835,0,t1_chs34d6,Case Purely subjectivePower I just go with whatever good quality one is available in my area. That should be fine.MoboThatll workCPU Are you overclocking? If not go for the nonK version. Additionally then you can downgrade your mobo do a H chipset. Some people are saying you can even downgrade to the i but I wouldnt do this because youre doing video editing.RAM Fine G.Skill is my favourite RAM brand and I havent had a single problem with my set.GPU This is where you can get a little creative. With the money youve saved from your MoboCPU downgrade you can get a better GPU such as the Nvidia GTX . HDD Some people have trouble with Seagate hard drives due to the boot error. I dont know what its like with a hybrid one but personally Id buy  SSDs for Windows and OSX then something like a WD Green or Seagate drive for storage. Its probably a bit more expensive all up but will be easier to set up and faster to run.Cooling I dont have experience in this area so no comment.DVD Drive Theyre all the same these days just get a cheap one for installing Windows and ripping CDs or whatever.Should be a killer build overall if you follow those steps. A few things to consider thatd change your build in more major ways. Consider the Xeon CPUs. There are a few that run on the same  socket as the is and are basically is without overclocking and more cache. They also have hyperthreading and may perform similarbetter at a lower price point than the K.. Check out the AMD cards. Im not sure what the pricing is like in Canada but the r series is pretty well supported for hackintoshes  except the X ones. Read comparisons online to get yourself a good deal. Just remember that Nvidia gets better GPU acceleration for Photoshop and other Adobe programs but AMD usually has more graphics memory and slightly better performance depending on the game to price ratio.I hope that helps.,hackintosh,chsumuw,2,t5_2quen

2178503,0,t3_2jzb6v,I had the same problem just solved it yesterday. First of all make sure you installed clover with the right settings to be able to boot your PC. To do this install clover to a usb drive formated as FAT with the same settings you installed it on your pc and try to boot from it. If it does good on you you got the right settings. If not you gotta research more on what to install with Clover. Now I am also dualbooting Windows and Yosemite and I got two problems that would lead to my pc still booting from chimera. The first one being clover not installing its stuff to the ESP but only to EFI. To solve this Go into terminal and first of all make hidden files visible with        defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled Then type in         diskutil listAnd make sure you know what identifier your EFI partition on your boot drive has. in most cases its disks like in my case so for the following terminal commands I will use this as an example adjust it to your needs.Then with the terminal create a mount point in Volumes with    sudo mkdir VolumesESPnow you gotta hang in the EFI with    sudo mount t msdos devdisks VolumesESPand copy the files from your clover install with    cp a EFI VolumesESPAfter that try rebooting. This might have already fixed your issue. If not its probably because of the dualboot like in my case. The following did the rest for meMount your EFI Partition either with clover configurator disk utility terminal or whatever you want. Then go into EFIClover and copy CLOVERX.efi paste the file in EFIMicrosoftBoot. In the folder EFIMicrosoftBoot rename the file bootmgfw.efi to bootmgfworig.efi and rename the file CLOVERX you just copied into the Microsoft folder to bootmgfw.efiAfter that my PC finally booted with Clover. I hope this works for you I spend countless hours trying to get Clover to work and with the help of some different hackintosh boards I finally got it. I still cant use clover for the purpose I originally wanted for example updating iWork  to the newest Version for free many people are reporting that they are only able to do this with Clover but at least I am one step closer now haha. Tell me if this works for you and good luck.  ,hackintosh,clgqody,1,t5_2quen

2310106,0,t3_2lq7l2,well here is a link to the whole article Ive tried to have Windows .Mavericks dual booting from the same drive.  Ive gotten that message where it says that the disk needs to be repaired.  The problem in my case was that I had the hard drive partitioned as GPT and . uses MBR.  So windows repartitioned my hard drive as MBR for me how nice right?! And then I could not boot into OS X anymore.  So is the drive that you installed windows to an MBR partitioned drive? I would check that first.  If it is not Im afraid that youre gonna have to reinstall as windows will not allow it to boot.  You can try to let windows repair run and see if that works but it will just reorder the boot order and screw your partition scheme.  Try to get in touch with HackinDoge as he is very helpful and very knowledgeable about booting multiple OSs.  You may also wanna try to climb the mountain that is Clover so that both OSs are booting from the EFI partition.  But that is a whole other headache.

3412867,0,t3_2zascy,Heres a quick list of some decent parts.  All these parts can be bought new at a decent price but for the GPU I chose a ti. You will have to find second hand but it wont be hard and  is a little higher than the prices you can find.  Its a decent card and at a good price point and since they were popular they shouldnt be hard to find used. I tried to stay on the lower side of your budget in case you have to buy windows and a monitor.  Keep in mind the sidebar of the sub has tons of useful links as well at this one which is where I got most of these parts.  I do stress the biggest savings is buying a used GPU though since older ones though still up to par with modern demands  always drop in value when newer better ones come out. If youre going Nvidia I would look into a  or  series card or perhaps something like a rx if you like ATI.  My favorite places to price used hardware is ebay used Amazon or come stop by rhardwareswap. If you dont mind used hardware you should also look for a used rd gen i for the same price as the new th gen i and you can use that same motherboard in the link.

4636070,0,t3_3eh9bj,For clarification what the patched UEFI BIOS does is unlock the xE MSR register which AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext AICPUPM or XNU Power Management XCPM tries to write to and panics when it fails.ASUS boards do have the xE MSR register locked but thats not as much of an issue these days. Clover can automatically patch the kernel KernelPm to prevent kernel panics caused by XCPM trying to write to this register. I personally would patch it  more native but its not really necessary.With Haswell and above XNU CPU Power Management XCPM is the standard power management mode. This is done entirely in the kernel  AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext isnt even loaded at all. Thats why youd patch the kernel instead of patching AICPUPM if your BIOS has the MSR xE register locked.,hackintosh,ctey1hl,4,t5_2quen

Boot it with nvdisable and maybe inject intel install the webdrivers then replace nvdisable with nvdadrv and reboot.What you do on your mac side shouldnt have much of an impact on windows.

Its your hardware choices and ability to configure your installation that make system stability a factor.Assuming you can obtain the Yosemite installer the principal deciding factor could well be the complex USB handling changes introduced in El Capitan. The fixes as described in various threads in Hackintosh forums are complex and definitely not noobfriendly at least for most people who would selfdescribe as a noob. Spend some time reading here and here as a start to see if you are confident in handling the USB fix in El Capitan.

GB seems like a lot at first for an SSD but believe me even a casual user can fill it up fast with music and programs like the Office suite or Apples iLife suite.

5914575,0,t3_3wb4e3,I think the mistake youre making is youre trying to map a key manually to fix the issue when theyre already mapped. You basically just use Windows key as Command and the Alt key as the Option key in OS X. So for most common keyboard shortcuts youd do something like WinkeyP  CommandP which is Print in most programs just like CTRLP would be on Windows.  So WinkeyA to select all WinkeyC to copy WinkeyV to paste etc. And if you wanted to do something like dragging and dropping a file in the Finder and forcing it to copy instead of move the file you could drag and drop while holding the Alt key equivalent to the Mac Option key.The link above also has info on remapping the keys through the System Preferences if you want to customize it.

If the computer crashes after an amount of time you are happy with then the port is actually fine and the culprit is a bad OSx kext or driver causing the port to produce too much or too little power.  Causing a hang and a crash.  Alternatively if you plug it in and find that the USB port does cause a crash in windows then you can try to unplug that particular of port by unplugging the USB header to the case.  If that works then you can be sure that the case is shorting out the USB header and that is the culprit... Good Luck ,hackintosh,cxzh86a,1,t5_2quen

6037350,0,t1_cyaw5sn,I dont even know if that efi driver swap had any relevance to your situation or to most newer Hackintoshes. One user somewhere whod had a very similar verbose output did get a fix by doing that driver replacement so I thought it might be worth a try.I suppose another longshot thing would be to simply remove your discrete GPU and attempt another reboot. Stranger things have happened.The kind of verbose you got has been reported before but its very difficult to research. You never know how anyone else would describe it or if they just post a screenshot without describing it so finding potential fixes is tough.It seems as if your hardware should be highly compatible. There might be some fiddly stuff with respect to your MSI motherboardthey dont have the same track record of compatibility that Gigabyte has had at least prior to the series chipsets.Were it me if OS X simply became unbootable even with a knowngood USB installer stick then Id be thinking of making a fresh installation and starting with a freshly made USB stick for good measure. Many a Hackintosher has had to make multiple clean installs before getting it all right.One important thing to do as prep is careful searching on your exact motherboard. Look for discussion of necessary BIOSUEFI patches or DSDT edits. Make sure to have the most recent firmware from MSI. Ive also read elsewhere that MSI has had special nonpublic firmwares for some boards e.g. one with MSR Lock configurable to disabledI think that was the feature. Youd have to post a request to MSI support about that.While another respondent mentioned doing a file replacement on the OS X drive via Windows command line tools Ive no idea how to accomplish that as the files on the OS X EFI partition arent Windows native file types so far as I understand. Maybe some googling will show the way since there are many dualboot Hackintoshes around. I have negligible command lineterminal experience so my ignorance is really showing here. Im much happier in an intuitive GUI environment.,hackintosh,cyb0cqv,1,t5_2quen

If you dont install Clover to the system drive it wont boot unless the Clover USB stick is connected.Clover however is not a postinstall tool. Neither is it a kext installed during postinstall. Clover is simply a boot loader although a very complex one. Clover sits between the motherboard firmware and OS Xits job is to present the PC hardware as if it were genuine Mac parts.,hackintosh,cyhutjv,1,t5_2quen

I did not select anything else. I did not have to change the ID of my card or anything and its using the AMD kext.Im assuming you read through this post I was unclear if I had to spoof the ID so I didnt at first and it worked.  Im not sure if that is no longer necessary for Clover with my specific card or if its something else.  Also in the compatibility chart look at the difference between the  and x.  It says that OODyes means you have to add or spoof the ID.  The x says OOByes but there are no known issues.  The  says OOBno but the device ID is missing.

Not to play Monday morning quarterback but this is why having a Carbon Copy Cloaner CCC backup is so important since it is fully bootable.That being said heres what I recommend doing if you do not have a bootable OS X partition. Im guessing you have another computer other than your hackintosh. Install Windows and install VMWare Player. Download a VMWare image of OSX you can find it with some googleing. Then once you have it up and running in VMWare connect your hackintosh hard drive via USB youll need a hard drive cradle. Once it is connected follow the instructions for upgrading to Clover.  Obviously youll skip the installation portion of the guide and go right to the configuration part. Make sure to do all of the installs on the mounted USB drive your Hackintosh drive.I hope this helps you. Good luck!,hackintosh,d3e5dd4,1,t5_2quen

The generic guide is bestsuited for Haswell systems.

8172488,0,t3_4r6z4s,I would head over to tonymacx.com and have a look at their el Capitan laptop guides. Typically theyll mention the specs and what doesdoesnt work. Ive used a hackintosh laptop EliteBook  G for about  months. Once you get everything set up youre set. However unless you use an Elitebook kd other compatible HP laptop dont plan on updating normally. The HPs are maintained very well and are the closest youll get to a real macbook. The others will work but the update process isnt as predefined a lot of the files used to get it working may be overwritten when updating therefore soft bricking your system. So youd have to wait for someone to test it if youre savvy do it yourself. Just keep that in mind when choosing a non Hp laptop for this. ,hackintosh,d4z3zqn,2,t5_2quen

8210381,0,t1_d5306oo,If I have to admit I do have a few problems with my displays. Ive made workarounds that have worked for me. Most of my problems however have come from using two displays off of the integrated graphics in my motherboard. Booting up with both displays plugged in causes the Mac to boot but not display anything. To solve this I just leave one cable unplugged while it boots up and simply plug it back in when El Capitan starts up. Sleep doesnt actually work for me. To solve this I basically got my computer to run super quiet. Quieter than my Playstation . Its essentially so quiet that when the AC in my house is running I cant even hear the computer. Then the LED kit in my computer is remote controlled so I just simply use the remote to shut the LEDs off and simply turn off both of my monitors. Fortunately turning on the monitors again picks up the display immediately without issues. So its not really true sleep but I guess using a Hackintosh nothing is really true and workarounds have to be made. Haha.,hackintosh,d53upen,1,t5_2quen

But at a small startup say where I end up being the IT the employer would finance the hardwarelicenses but would only do so if that would not put them in legal trouble. Id like to introduce the setup for a pipeline in future roles but cannot do so without legal sources to back it up if it is at all possible. I wouldnt install unregisteredunlicensed software at the workplace.Id think that if you pay for the product legallyApple hardware with the OS that you should be able to use at you see fit like any other product? So long as youre not running more than one instance of the OS at a time. The condition of it being usedinstalled on the basis of owning the Apple producthardware should allow it right?One thing that is not clear is where a restriction is mention for only running the OS on Apple branded hardware. How is that defined when common hardware such as the CPU and GPU are third party from the usual vendors like Intel and Nvidia? Plenty of additional hardware such as external GPUs and displaysperipherals can be added and are not Apple branded yet that is legal. Can I just buy a nd hand mac towerapple branded case and gut it to replace the internals with my own hardware?I just want to be able to use it when required for compilingsubmitting Apple iOS apps and the like and possibly some Mac exclusive applications once in a while.

10329523,0,t1_dces1th,Hey sorry I realise I was being vague and therefore a little confusing.So I got this board and the USB .C port DOES function as a TB port. I spoke to Gigabyte on Twitter a few times before buying it to make sure it did. And Ive read people on the Tonymac forum saying theyve been able to use it to connect to TB devices using the Startech TB   adaptor.There is a BIOS update and an enabler app WINDOWS ONLY which you can download from Gigabyte which will switch on the Thunderbolt connection on that board. Youll notice the board has the same Intel USBTB chipset as all the other boards they make which say Thunderbolt  ready and therefore you can enable it on this rather cheaper board as well.One thing to consider regarding TB is that although you would probably be wise to have it onboard until very recently TB simply did not work under any version of OS X and now it works but its unclear as to which chipsets and devices are supported as a lot of older TB devices dont even work when connected to Apples own computers although Ive heard theres a software fix for this. So at the moment you really cant tell  if the port will ever do anything other than USB..If you want TB to work you will need to use Sierra so that much is decided for you.Also the other consideration are that currently there are VERY few devices with TB onboard. Although Im sure well see audio devices with it in future even if its just an optional second connection along with TB. Right now theres not really any advantage to using it yes its higher bandwidth but almost no one was pushing the bandwidth of TB anyway.I would definitely hold fire on the extra TB cards like some others say I think theyre meant for use with Asus boards and if you dont yet know if TB will ever work in this type of arrangement it might be better to just hang on with the one port until you have something to plug into them.You can add this stuff later remember thats part of the beauty of a hackintosh. I know you dont want to be opening it up every  weeks but personally Id hold fire on a few of the things in the list like the extra SSDs and stuff and just get the base machine up and running first then add that stuff in when you actually need it.,hackintosh,dcewqrv,2,t5_2quen

10697996,0,t3_5syzow,Cant afford a good Mac cant stand using Windows. My hackintosh of  years died on me last week video card I think and Ive been forced to use my backup computer with Windows. God I forgot how much I dislike it after using Mac OS almost exclusively since OS .. Its all the little things like how the mouse wheel doesnt scroll the window under the pointer it follows the keyboard focus which is stupid. Having to install rd party software just so your mouse behaves properly is not a good sign. I really miss the macs column view navigating windows is a pain. Accidentally doubleclick on a program twice? Lets open two separate instances! That makes sense!I got my first ever virus in  years of computer use after a few days on Windows because I forgot you actually have to be vigilant. One wrong click and suddenly my default browser was IE all traffic was routed through some wacky search engine Ive never heard of and any browser I opened Firefox and Chrome immediately went into and endless popup loop until forced quit. Then they started opening themselves every  seconds. Took me two hours to fix because I didnt have enough control of my browsers to download Malwarebytes.Windows does completely blow Mac OS out of the water with gaming though. Im now catching up on about  years of PC gaming. Playing Borderlands  right now absolutely love it. Also the look and feel of the OS is much more customizationfriendly though if Apple put out a dark skin for Mac OS I wouldnt miss themes.But possibly my number one reason is Logic Pro. I started out using Garageband about ten years ago moved up to Logic a few years later. It really is amazing software. Intuitive easy to use powerful. Ive been trying to get the hang of Fruity Loops while I debate building a new hack or getting a used Mac but its just not the same.

11493267,0,t3_640kwa,I cant watch the video right now but you can tell if its coil whine if it sounds like a tea kettle blowing off steam. You can try something to be sure try to run an old D game that demands little power and use Nvidia Shadowplay to show how many fps youre getting. Make sure theres no max fps cap and you should get hundreds. Does the sound gets more noticeable the more fps you get? Does it change when you enter the pause menu in the game or in any situation where the game stops rendering D graphics? If the answer is yes then it probably is coil whine.It doesnt mean your card is broken or going to break. Some models are more prone to show this behaviour and I think Nvidia Maxwell cards in particular. Mine has it too but its barely noticeable unless I get really high fps. It can also happen with other components with coils like power supply units.tldr If it sounds like a tea pot its mildly annoying but its not broken.,hackintosh,dfyredp,1,t5_2quen
