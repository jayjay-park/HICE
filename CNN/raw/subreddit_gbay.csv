8222357,0,t1_d557hbg,Uphill.But seriously I do like the videos you are making right now the ranked gameplay videos are not getting repetitive as long as you space them with something else but I do think that you should make them a bit longer . My favorite content of your is the stuff outside of league gameplay things like QampAs THE GREATEST PVP ESCAPE EVVVVVER and videos of you rambling. Ive seen some people saying that you should make videos with other people but I disagree I really like the solo feel of your channel and collaborating with people might ruin that. no offence And besides Sky fits that role much better than you probably could. My biggest complaint though is your streaming schedule. Stream More.        lt you gbay,gbay,d55cn5x,1,t5_3579h
