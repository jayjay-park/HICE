What annoyed me about Hermione I think is that she had this savior complex going on. She was going to rescue them  but they didnt feel like they were being rescued! I think it would have been much better if shed gone to the elves and helped them help themselves. When Dobby came to Harry he was already rebellious for House elf standards but still adhered to the rules for the most part e.g. reflexive selfpunishment. But Harry showing him so much respect and really perceiving him as a person rather than just a thingthatworks definitely boosted his selfesteem. Maybe if Hermione had gone about her SPEW business in a similar way encouraging house elves to question their position and assert themselves things would have worked out better. Maybe she could have tried to learn more about the history of house elves e.g. howwhen they became domesticated... I feel like all of her SPEW activities were very farremoved from house elf reality. If shed given the elves the tools to educate themselves maybe they would have formed their own organizations which I think would have been awesome and a lot more effective.Then again Hermione is only  in the books so you cant really expect her to have everything figured out already.,HarryPotterBooks,cij63fk,4,t5_2zc4g

4969288,0,t3_3iw3fv,James couldnt have been Secret Keeper because Lily James and Harry were being protected by the spell. If they were only protecting their house as in Bills case with Shell Cottage then he could have. Its that distinction between being under the spells protection and being inside the house that is under protection. ,HarryPotterBooks,cukwzd6,5,t5_2zc4g
