3491603,0,t1_cpq92bq,I agree. Im not into  gun but it seems like the only  Gun going on in VA is either Richmond  Gun or at Peacemaker being in WV. Im pretty sure there are more outlaw matches going on but they are hard to find info on.,VAGuns,cpq9nb4,2,t5_353l3

4723758,0,t1_ctpyn3t,The reason why I do both of those things is because if I ever have to use my firearm to defend myself I dont want to be worried about racking a slide and taking a safety off before I can fire. Those are not super easy to do under stress. Do you shoot?,VAGuns,ctpywr0,2,t5_353l3
4727254,0,t1_ctqa3xf,gt Youre the one attributing maliceMalice? Hardly. Im pointing out the reality of a situation one that cops and their fans dont want to acknowledge but inadvertently slipped through the cracks this time.gt Does it make you feel superior to me?I dunno. Maybe? I hadnt even thought of it that way. But if I were the one lecturing someone else about grammar which btw is not a proper noun and should not be capitalized. Cant call that one a typo now can you? haha in a post that was filled with errors I would definitely be embarrassed about the egg on my face. A little humility would even be in order. gt  I dont really care. Youre a random stranger on the internet and I dont give a damn if you feel superior to me. My self esteem doesnt depend on the opinion of random strangers.Yes I can see that by your desperate attempts to deny it. ,VAGuns,ctqesod,1,t5_353l3
5075793,0,t1_cux2sku,I agree. People also bring up the limp wrist factor with the G. Im sure its possible but then again its meant to be an everyday conceal carry. In a lot of situation you dont have the time to make sure your wrist is positioned perfectly. ,VAGuns,cuxtoxa,1,t5_353l3

5578685,0,t3_3rj99j,gt Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw DFairfaxsaid he suspected irregularities in a Richmondarea race won by the GOP because Republican turnout was so heavy.

6925998,0,t1_d10lrc0,this is a pretty poor response.The odds of needing your CCW are low as fuck. The reason we all carry is because we want to be prepared for the worst cast scenario. A CCW legal insurance plan is actually fairly cheap under  a year. And saying you wont get sued is just plain wrong. Look at a lot of the big anticop cases pushed by the BLM crew.It doesnt take a lot of money to make your life hell. Anyone can afford a cheap lawyer who will just drag their feet to try and make you shell out money out of court.,VAGuns,d11dxmi,1,t5_353l3

10905770,0,t1_de4spk9,A huge majority of knives now can be opened and closed relatively easily with one hand.A flick of the thumb and wrist on an unassisted knife or a little nudge of a flipperstud with an assisted knife and its usually ready to go by the time I have a firm grip on it out of my pocket. I can also actuate any locking mechanism and close it by either dropping the blade or folding it against my leghip.Except for OTF autos where a button opens and closes them automatically theres basically zero difference in their ability to be used as a weapon.If you really want fast access skip the autos and go to a knife with a wave feature. Its a little hook that catches on your pocket as you pull it flipping it open as it is drawn. The reasoning here is just idiotic.,VAGuns,de4uplk,2,t5_353l3
