1343747,0,t1_cij2mw2,But we had this more or less in the s and s or so then we regressed. When looking at the class division capitalism seems to naturally head toward disequilibrium. What makes you think the golden age was not just a temporary blimp of capitalism resulting from huge exogenous shocks? Picketty makes a good argument about a capital tax but even he admits the idea is utopian. Were obviously not doing it right now because of how difficult it is to implement. Even if we succeed in the future how long can it last? Permanently or for just another blip?,SocialDemocracy,cikscce,1,t5_2sjw0

3667567,1,t1_cqa9xv7,I dont get along with a lot of people in that sub but to get all huffy over you interactions there and run away to cry about it isnt terribly productive either. Youre being a bit melodramatic in portrayal of your persecution. Mixed in among the absolutism which there is plenty of in most of the political subreddits one does find legitimate criticisms of the approach social democracy has taken in any number of locations. Im in the US so I tend to be quite critical of the fragile weak implementation we achieved from Roosevelt to Johnsonlittle significant since and we have a right hell bent on taking us back entirely to the robber baron days. Weve become an Oligarchy in no small part because we never addressed the issue of who owns adequately through reformist policies. Socialism at its core is about distributed ownership and self management. That is something we need much more of to achieve lasting social reforms.,SocialDemocracy,cqabsq1,5,t5_2sjw0

5004268,0,t1_cunk9hs,See when you say Welfare Capitalism what comes to mind is a free market private sector with generous government handouts to those at the bottom. Social Democracy at least in my country is more than just that it calls for reform of all of the private sector and much larger public sector as well as a welfare state. I might be wrong on this but thats the association to me with Welfare Capitalism. ,SocialDemocracy,cup79w6,2,t5_2sjw0

5984062,0,t3_3xev3i,I do not because I do not see socialism as a solution to the root problems of civilization. I very much agree with Elluls analysis that the master of modern man is technique and that capitalists and Marxists alike foolishly see technology as a great liberator when in reality we are its blind thralls. I see social democracy as the most just and efficient arrangement of technological society anticipating that technique will one day either make man obsolete or destroy us somewhere on the path to obsolescence. So while I see the capitalist as stupidly evil I see the socialist as ridiculously naive.,SocialDemocracy,cy41iug,2,t5_2sjw0

6586273,0,t1_d0028wj,Capitalists dont necessarily want higher quality products. Consumers might but as wages have stagnated in the west since the s consumers have far less freedom to vote with their dollars. If the choice is between manufacturing in a high wage society or a low wage society it will the vast majority of the time go to the low wage society. An exception to this is the iPhone which is manufactured largely in Germany and Japan. But its not hard to see that the iPhone is an exception to most commodities that society buys. iPhones are if we are being honest a luxury good. Even if you need a smart phone there are less expensive alternatives. At this point in time I dont see any reason why capitalists in the manufacturing sector would want to continue employing western societies who have fought and died for workers rights and higher wages when they can go recreate s America in a third world country. Capitalists do not owe anything to a particular society. Society is the only entity looking out for its own wellbeing. Socialists and Communists understand this and its why we get frustrated with reformists. You can reform all you want but you are only making that country less and less appealing to create industry in. ,SocialDemocracy,d00koq5,1,t5_2sjw0

10798018,0,t3_5ucqko,I will say that this country has gone a bit overboard in caring more about other countries than it does our own citizens. I understand the need for diplomacy but I also feel like we need to tackle our own problems first. We should not have a homeless crisis in the richest nation on earth. We should not have  of children living below the poverty line. We spend way too much on defense of other nations and not enough on defense of ours. Just once Id like to hear our government say Sorry we cant fight your war for you. Were trying to house the homeless and give our children a future.This being said I dont consider immigrants enemies and I dont feel like they should all be painted with the same brush. I do feel like we need to figure out something so that migrant workers can continue to work our farms and fields though while still keeping the drugs out. Thats a tough one.Corporate America wants you to think immigrants are taking your jobs but the truth is that automation and outsourcing by those same corporations is what has destroyed your jobs. We cant stop progress so automation is going to take jobs thats just how it is. As an example look at Amazon. There are millions of people employed with delivery services who would lose their jobs if Amazon starts drone delivery but we cant stop that. Its the way the world is going. Still we need to take care of the people who have lost their jobs to automation and especially to outsourcing. We have to find a way to reeducate or reemploy them. Im all for forcing welfare recipients to take some of the jobs that they swear immigrants are stealing just to show them that they wouldnt want them and they wouldnt be good at them so we can just put that freaking issue aside.The U.S. economy is changing and it isnt going back to what it was. We have to take care of our problems and stop trying to blame it on someone or something else.,SocialDemocracy,ddtqlae,2,t5_2sjw0
