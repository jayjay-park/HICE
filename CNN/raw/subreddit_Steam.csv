48426,0,t1_cejseyr,gt Steambox was supposed to be about mainstream users and it failed miserably because it offers nothing extra to the users to help it compete with consoles not even anything special to earn a steambox logo like a minimum graphics standard.No it wasnt Valve have denied at every corner. The point is to get the PC platform from an architecture view in the living room. A entertainment system that is completely open has easy access to games and is as flexible as a PC. Never did Valve claim you cant do it already or that their Steam Machine would be the best way to do it.gt Thats the point it cant. These things fulfill no extra needs over buying or building any pc and just loading steamOS onto it.As has been pointed over and over again but you seem unable to look at this objectivly without your personal opinion so I might aswel talk to a wall. Not everyone wants to build their own machine not everyone wants to spend days in finding the best configuration. Not everyone wants or can set up a similar system on their own. Their will be people who want to play Steam games sitting on their sofa before a big TV. Theyll decide on a budget and buy the Steam Machine they think is best with that budget. They need someone to hold their hands and show them to the Steam Machines. That is what Valve is doing Look over there Steam Machines! get one. Its Apples bread and butter Hey look over here a new iPhone its more new!  and hordes of people buy one. Yet they can easily get a smartphone that can do just as much for cheaper.Ive seen guys go through many xboxs getting a new one each Red Ring Of Death. Spending much more on that console than they wouldve if they just hooked a xbox controller to a far more powerful PC. Yet they keep buying into them. Convenience sells those are products that are being sold over and over because people dont want to figure it out themselves. People will buy these steam machines because it looks good under their TV. And they dont care about the price. Innovation isnt always better hardware or better software. Often its just a mindset. Steam Machines are a mindset You can have a gaming machine in your living room that runs PC games. You dont have to cope with Windows to get it done. You can spend as much as you want on hardware to achieve that.This is about Openess and freedom ,Steam,cejxz2s,1,t5_2qwis

As I said in one of my other replies here pros apparently have enormous friends lists and it only takes one compromised player on that list to expose you during an important match.A fix for the underlying attack vector like an option to disable incoming voice chat requests or to delay establishing the connection until after you hit accept would be better.,Steam,cfqwmdx,1,t5_2qwis

If it is utter crap then that time may drop.  If its good Ill usually play it for more than  min and visit it later as well.Technically the number of games I consider unplayed or my backlog is actually less than the  I havent touched.  If a game was part of a humble bundle it does not matter if it is played or not as I made a donation to charity the games were just a bonus.  Usually I buy humble bundles if there is at least  games I know Ill play for quite a long time.  So I get my moneys worth.  I also do lots of trading and on many times have successfully traded TF keys for packs of games then turn around and traded the  extra copies for the cost I spent on the pack. Basically resulting in me getting a free game.  I have  unplayed games I got in this manner.  So not counting humble bundletraded. I have  I got from other bundlessources.

I have a slight preference for the PS controller but once Im playing a game I tend to not even notice which one Im using.  The only preference Id have for the  controller is that most games tend to be designed for it which means that they consider RT and LT the main shoulder buttons and RB and LB to be secondary which is the opposite of the PS using R and L as primaries and R and L as secondaries.  But even that is usually not too big of a deal.The option to play wirelessly and the lack of software headaches would be nice.  So many times my PS has turned itself on because MIJ was giving me trouble so I unplug my controller and plug it back in and when it unplugs it just goes HOLY CRAP WHERED EVERYTHING GO?

It seems in the last few months a lot of publishers have been offloading their back catalogs onto Steam including some horrid games that hardly function that were made  years ago and likely wont see any bug fixes at all and these are often going for . Id actually trust some of the Early Access games more especially if there is a history of regular updates because then theres a fairly good chance that any bugs you might encounter will actually be fixed.

This is not because there would be no work to be done if every human multimillionaire died overnight.  It is because an artificial system has been built up to concentrate economic power in the hands of a tiny minority primarily selected through in a hereditary manner.  The primary difference between st century capitalism and th century feudalism is that entry into the elite now requires the accumulation of money rather than obtaining a personal favor from the head of state.Publishers can be bad or good but it is increasingly common that they leverage their position in our corporate power structure to do very bad things.  Business schools are less about teaching students to actually accomplish anything and more about enforcing the orthodoxy of the dominant economic paradigm.  There is no law of physics nor even a provision of the Constitution that would prevent America from becoming an economic commune where game developers were apportioned resources reflective of the popularity of their previous work.  Kickstarter campaigns and the like could coexist with this reality.

You could open a ticket with Support but theyd only see that you traded the knife to a guy for nothing.  They cant verify if you got anything outside of Steam so they wont do anything.  Sorry.  Also  keys? Like TF keys? Thats like  USD.  No knife is worth that much.  That would have been a red flag in my book.  Here is my way to minimize the risk of trading such a high value item for money    Sell it on the Steam Market   Use your new Steam Wallet funds to buy TF Keys from the market.    Sell those keys for paypalywhatever in small groups of  keys.   ????    Profit!  Yes you lose a percentage to Valve on the Market and you probably have to sell the keys for less than you paid for them but think about this.  If someone rips you off  keys your out maybe .

1252311,0,t1_ciahoqt,There have been a few. The most recent one involved coal but it ran into some pretty big problems because jerks exploited the system.My absolute favorite was the summer sale... I believe? It had a ton of heart the rewards were mostly useless but you could potentially get everything if you picked up enough achievements. The achievements were all tied into games that were on sale and most of them were special and summer themed. The rewards were varied and cost a different amount of tickets each. They ranged from summerthemed DLC and in game content to full games.Im just hoping for something more than another idle or play games until cards randomly drop buy the rest combine and repeat. For that year or two where Steam really went all out for their sales the Steam sale was an actual event with fun stuff to look forward to every day. Now its just another pretty decent sale where the fun is over the second the clock runs over and you find out that theres nothing you want for the day.Not saying that its awful by any means but its certainly not as fun as the  sales were.,Steam,ciai0vf,8,t5_2qwis

Getting more cards to get a higher badge to score more points it is all  that passes through the market and into Valves coffers as they skim off the top. Not to say it isnt fun or entertaining.

If you miss one of these increased discounts for a game you might want theres a chance itll reappear again before the Summer Sale Ends so dont fret. If youre not interested in the Teams or Badges sell any Summer Adventure Cards you get on the Market. They will disappear once the sale ends so theres no point in holding onto them if you dont intend to use them. Additionally now is a good time to offload any cards you might have from other games as the demand for them has increased with all the badge crafting which increased the card prices slightly. After the Summer Sale ends if you missed out on any games you wanted check out rSteamGameSwap. You can use that subreddit to find people who have games you want and are willing to accept something else usually TF Keys or other games in return. Its a good way to get games at a discount after the fact. Youll still likely have to offer a little more than what the game in question was on sale for but if you really want it it beats paying full price or waiting for the next big sale Black Friday.,Steam,cidcqsr,3,t5_2qwis

By the time I get home the summer sale will be over. So I decided to buy some games while Im here. I tried Visa QIWI Wallet and added . to my Steam Wallet which means I am NOT using QIWI for the payment. I paid in Rubles at the QIWI kiosk. Since I am in Russia ATM the prices were in Rubles so I edited my profile and selected USA as my home country and used the ?ccus trick in the URL which was a solution for people with similar problems. However even though the currency matches all I get is an error. You can see a screenshot of the error in the attachment.gt gt Note I also tried paying with a credit card prior to QIWI which gave me the same error.gt gt Thank you in advance.

Geneforge may be a wonderful classic RPG but the game engine is infuriating.Dont get me wrong I adore Jeff Vogel and I grew up with hundreds of hours on Exile III. I really really wanted to enjoy the hell out of Geneforge. I would love to play through the story...but the engine is just impossible to play with.The screen is tiny and cant be modified it forces fullscreen and for some reason the simplistic sprites introduce massively slowed responsiveness as you clear out a map. At times it takes half a second or more between clicking and taking a step and it makes no sense why this is the case. It feels like youre trudging through molasses as you move around.In the end the controls and painfully sluggish interface were just too impossibly clunky and it completely overshadowed my enjoyment of the mechanics and the game. I am a huge Vogel fan but I cant recommend Geneforge.Theres another Jeff Vogel game... Avernum Escape from the Pit Its fantastic much more modern and its also a classic isometric party RPG. The issues with the engine are fixed and it runs much smoother. Get that one not Geneforge. Its  off and well worth the ..,Steam,cijgu0d,11,t5_2qwis

If it helps the game is great on its own.  The DLC is almost all cosmetic stuff like clothes and weapon skins but theres plenty of both in the base game already.  There are a few gimmicky new weapons but again the base game contains plenty of those too.  The story DLC is pretty disappointing theyre about an hour long each and not terribly interesting nor do they have anything at all to do with the main story of the game or the series.

For example Metal Gear Rising can not be activated from Japan. so you might want to google games on your inventory to see if it has regional activation lock.  Some game are not available for purchase in some countries so if you went back to India you may find that some games on your wishlist cant be purchased anymore.  Also you should tell steam support that you are moving to India because if you log in from India that will be considered as Suspicious Login from different country and your account will get suspended.Thats what I got for travelling from Japan to U.S.,Steam,cj3e6aa,5,t5_2qwis

1583941,0,t1_cjesvwb,Well in my town again it happened because of WW. As everyone knows gypsies were put in labour death camps. Whenever the young gypsies are brought in to the police station their mums and dads always complain theyre the minority this includes pakistanis and poles. When the parents see their children can get away scott free with crime just by mentioning minorities and WW the cops usually cant be bothered and dont want to deal with a filed complaint against them. They do turn a blind eye at petty revenge or full on revenge I have a story about that tell me if you want to hear it. They first were looked down apon in my town because they parked their caravans on fields with crops on them. The farmer couldnt get them to move because the cops did nothing and the farmer lost partial yield. Then they started stealing stuff from the farmers to sell. They also dig up copper cables to sell too. By this time a lot of people hated them because they dug up Rogers fucking farm again for copper cables and fucking pikeys sitting on Rogers land They dont pay tax they are a devil and theyre a nasty community when theyre in near the town. In schools theyre disruptive they steal other kids lunch and they dont want to learn. A lot of the time I never walked out of my house apart from school because a group of  pikey kids tried stealing from my bag every time I left my house for x reason. No I dont outright hate them I just hate them particular people in my town.  Can I just say I love how in the Steam subreddit we have reduced ourselves to talking about gypsies?

1596320,0,t1_cjgd562,By modern design I just mean its following modern design trends which is using more solid colors and focusing on typography. In regards to rightclicking you are right but the idea was that it was not meant to replace  the right click menu. The premise of the action bar is optimization for touch and that its a bit more userfriendly for users to see options without needing to rightclick. Its not a big deal it just a little thing. Its something thats used in some operating systems and websites usually when it comes to file management. There are some file options on the top bar but when you right click you have the same options except more usually.For the search box by unfocused its referring to the search box being unfocused and when you start typing it would auto focus to the search box. Similar to Windows  start screen. The idea is that when you go to your games library and whether you just went their or you clicked on a game already if you start typing you can narrow down your results without needing to set focus to the search box. Its similar to Windows s start menu search and Windows Live Messengers contact search. I also believe that Skype used to have something similar in an older version.For the settings button I thought having quickaccess to settings was important and believed that having that little color bar to light up when something important needed to be handled would be useful. For example it would glow red to remind you that your account isnt as safe as it could be and you should enable Steam Guard.I appreciate the criticism!

Every day theres some new post about someone getting  scammed or new scamming techniques a lot of which to me defies logic.Why trade valuables with strangers youve never met who you have no idea will honor the deal? Why entertain conversations with random people who make offersdealsinquiries when they could be potential scammers? Especially when they msg out of the blue. Why not use the market to simply sell your crap then use steam wallet funds to pay for new games? Why do people expect Valve to hold their hands for them and to return their stuff when a deal goes south?From what I understand there are already marketsbrokers in place that you can turn to which have systems set up to facilitate safe trades. Why not use those if youre looking to trade with strangers?Again Im not trying to bash OP and others who have been scammed.

Thats why then you alttab out you dont see a preview of the window as you do normally with other apps and it takes those few seconds of blackness to restart processing windows for that display.Borderless windowed is the best compromise although depending on how powerful your pc is you may need to turn down settings as it now has to process both the game and that monitors normal windows session. ,Steam,ckcelc7,1,t5_2qwis

1985470,0,t1_cksezkv,Free to Play doesnt give you access to the Community features though you need to actually buy something  Im happy to be proved wrong but that was what its been like from my experience about  years when I created a side account.Steam is more expensive than boxed copies when games are at full price. The only time Steam is cheaper is when there is a sale on and even then other stores are now offering extremely competitive pricing.Steam is great. Dont get me wrong there DRM is great and unintrusive and its great to have all your games in the same place!Ive been on Steam for around  or  years now. Ive had to deal with CS on  or  occasions. Not once have they helped me in the end Ive just had to dig around forums because they couldnt be bothered to read my original email. The number of complaints may be tiny but thats because everyone expects shitty CS now. There are very few people who have had a good experience with Steam support and as the Internet loves Valve then if it were anomalies then people would be going crazy with those spouting the bs.My point being Steam isnt free to use. To use most features you need to pay for a game. You also have game adverts shoved down your throat whenever you exit a game.,Steam,cksg6zr,0,t5_2qwis

2099227,0,t1_cl6na5x,It does vary on the game. Because many games relied on DirectX and DirectX is Windowsonly a fair number of ports had to have OpenGL support added on and depending on how they did this they might not have optimized things properly. This may lead to some decrease in graphical quality. That said if OpenGL support was there to begin with and it is properly optimized then you shouldnt see any performance decreases at all and in some cases the OpenGL version actually runs better than the DirectX version although these cases are relatively rare.Hopefully more games will be made with OpenGL support from the getgo making it easier to port and hopefully resulting in better performance results than some of the current ports.I will also say that in my experience the quality of the port can vary a lot especially between inhouse ports and thirdparty ports. There are a couple thirdparty companies that Ive seen that make really topnotch ports but others can be halfassed so you have to be careful when looking at this. Of course inhouse ports can also be poorly done just look at some console to PC ports so it can be hard to tell which ports are good and which arent at a glance. That said if they release it with PC and Linux at the same time thats generally a sign that the main team worked on both so it should run about the same on either machine.,Steam,cl6np6k,13,t5_2qwis

2295667,0,t1_clvaxmm,Yeah my idea is they should add a heuristic that determines how likely a friend request is legitimate. They already shows common groupsfriends so that would be a huge factor but looking for botlike behaviors or account settings could also factor in.With low enough score you dont even see a friend request unless you explicitly friend them back. Simply having a low score would show up but if you try to add them it would display a huge warning that the account is suspicious something similar could be done when trading too!. High scores would work as they do now.The page OP is showing could also display some of these heuristic factors so you can see how Steam came to its determination possibly. bot runners could become more clever about their bots so the heuristic might need to be secret.,Steam,clvgl5s,2,t5_2qwis

It just means that the disk throughput is  which happens when you read or write a lot of data.The freezing however is a bigger issue and it could indicate that your HDD is having problems. In fact it may be dying. My suggestion is to download a Harddisk diagnostics program such as CrystalDiskInfo warning The official installer has a lot of adware options that you need to uncheck in the installer and see if there are any alerts for your harddrive. If there are any immediately make a backup of anything you cant afford to lose such as documents photos etc. In fact its a good idea to make a backup of those things already.Under no circumstances should you try to defragment your harddrive until you have made sure its okay.Defragmenting puts a lot of stress on your harddrive and if there are any problems with it defragmentation can easily ruin your harddrive for good.TLDR Your harddrive may be dying.

Civ  at the highest difficulty levels is a boringly exact process where you go tall turtle barely ever expand or declare war and sprint up the tech tree in an exact path to be able to win before the AIs.BE changes all of that. Its viable to expand and keep expanding without tanking your development. You can reasonably go for any of the victories each game all of which involve a completely different tech path. Satellite bombardment and antiorbital strikes are cool. Not having to farm a gazillion XP to give your units awesome abilities is quite nice. Aliens are much more interesting to fight then barbarians. Being able to destroy outposts that are near fertile terrain is so much less frustrating then spawning near an unrazable city state thats exactly one tile away from a perfect city location.Ill admit BE is desperately in need of some patching to be as polished as Civ  but I find the core gameplay to be a lot of fun.,Steam,cmj4h4q,3,t5_2qwis

What im suggesting is a passive setting for whether friends can watch you when you arent currently streaming which will open a stream only for them and then a button on the steam overlay that starts a public stream manually.

2561920,0,t1_cmsyygk,Indeed. All in all the reason why steam got ahead at the start was because of popular HL mods and the requirement to have steam in order play their newest versions. Dod CS . CSS TFC TF. Remember the beginning when the store was full of constantly featured user generated content? Same content that disappeared after a few years and now started to slowly crawl back. During those the days EVERYONE was hating on steam because of its bugs and unreliability. Now people just shut up because they get a free hat and if you dare say anything negative you get a huge shitstorm and a note saying you should deal with it or leave. Its hilarious. Valve essentially became EA yet somehow managed to make people believe that theyre the chill dudes to hang out with. Heck users now DEMAND their drm for games. Is XY game on steam? No? I dont care then.But I guess Im more annoyed at the drooling userbase than anything else since all Valve does is strive for profit as a company sometimes in questionable ways I might add. ,Steam,cmszb24,2,t5_2qwis

Is it a DLC or a mobile game ported to PC or what?  Its .D which makes me think its a mobile game maybe?  It has Arkham Origins in the title but I dont think it includes Origins and I dont see it listed as DLC on the Origins page.  Is this some kind of beefed up DLC like what Saints Row is doing with Gat Outta Hell?Most importantly should I buy it?Edit  I found this totalbiscuit review of Blackgate and while he didnt like it I think I will so I picked it up.

While the isometric view and the narrator are still in place the battles are completely different. While you can fight in real time the key to winning is the Planning Mode in which you freeze time and plot out a series of actions then hit play and watch them unfold.Transistor is very good. I dont get the same feeling of amazement that I did from Bastion but thats because they knocked Bastion so far out of the park that its still orbiting the earth.

2740806,0,t1_cnfkpm0,I think youre well on your way to success but heres my list that I gave to my nontechnical relative to get them up and running before.  So maybe itll help you as well.  Im bored on a conference call so this is a much better use of my time than whatever is being talked about on the phone.  This is from having nothing at all set upOpen your internet browser and go to the site www.steampowered.comThere will be a button on the page labeled Install Steam. Its in the upper right of the screen and is red.Click that button!That will take you to a page with a BIG GREEN button that says Install Steam Now.  Since you are on a Mac use the Mac link or this linkInstall that software.Now start the steam client and put in your login credentialsSounds like you already have those but if not sign up!Since your friend gave you the game it SHOULD be in your library or it MIGHT be in your INVENTORY.  You access the inventory by going to your profile menu choice with your user name on it.  If its in your inventory highlight the game and on the right it will say add to my steam library.At that point it will be in your library but wait! You still have to install the game files.From your library click on the game Play and it will ask you if you want to install it.  Install away and when its ready you can start!Problems people can run intoSSD users sometimes people use a tiny SSD for their boot drive and install Steam there.  Steam then tries to install all the very large games on that SSD and theres not enough room.  You can make other Steam Libraries on other drives in your system if you have this problem.Cant find your games?  Steam has several tabs which include the Store Buy More Games! Your Library Community and your Profile.Your games are in your library BUT there is a filter at the top of the page that can get flipped to something so it doesnt show your games.  For example if you have installed selected it wont show your games if they arent installed. Make sure its set to Games and they should show up.Multiple Monitors Odds are you dont have this problem but Steam seems to have a hard time with multiple monitors for some people.  Just leave it on one monitor.Big Screen Dont use big screen mode until youre comfortable with Steam BUT its great for the right kind of game.Lastly Re Portal   as someone else said the sound clues are important and the dialog is funny in a dark humor kind of way but they did a great job of captioning the whole game so turn those on.  There are two main characters the first one you meet has a chatty upbeat British accent... hes... helpful.  The second is a female computer synthesized voice that is very cold and sarcastic.  There are other voices too but it would be too much of a spoiler.  Portal  is a great game.  I wish I could play it again for the first time.Good luck!,Steam,cnfm9jw,190,t5_2qwis

I used to be a very active trader myself to collect games only not to sell them and now I am just getting rid of my last spare trading copies as the cheap game market is dead basically. What I encountered now is that many traders wanting to buy something from me did not have the keys available due to  days lock and did not want to buy some from other traders via PayPal. So what we did is that we enlisted some cheap TF items like giftapult for  cents and the trader just buys them with Steam wallet adjusted for the trading price lets say it sells for  Euro instead of regular  cents.

Difficulty is merely a matter of checking how long it takes for a crack to show up.  To be fair GTAIV was rather successful in anticrack but they decided it wasnt worth the cost when it came to Max Payne .  The solution?  Put all the hacked games in their own server where modders and hackers with infinite health and aimbotting existed.  Their choice not to use the same DRM as they did in GTAIV is a big sign that piracy is not an issue.If youre worried about how DRM is working the biggest line you can draw away from the DRM arguing point is not the estimate of downloads its the number of people buying the competition.

I mean look at most other companys when shit goes down or breaks they provide updates straight away and are more active than ever when fixing it. Steam just seems like they dont care anymore. We dont matter to them shit will get done when it gets done until then too bad.That and their horrible steam support can really really make people agitated at steam. The communication issue with steam and the community has been a long standing issue for steam and its been asked to be fixed and brought up a lot by the community. This is why people are exaggerating and people want more updates.

3105621,0,t1_cojrt8u,Ah okay I stand corrected on the R rating. I had the right idea but just assumed it was  and under not under  since thats a rather strange and arbitrary cutoff number.That aside I stand by my point that R and AO are essentially the same when you ignore the one year differential. With the MPAA the difference between R and NC functionally only becomes effective to actively prevent inappropriate access in the narrow context of movie theaters. Obviously there is a difference in the sternness of the recommendation between R and NC but outside of the theater anyone who can watch one can watch the other provided a parentguardian allows them or they sneak it which is a whole other issue. In the realm of games which are even less enforced through formalized infrastructure and are always consumed independently the difference between M and AO is even less pronounced. Its purely a matter of recommendation. If you can get a parent to buy you an M game you can probably get them to buy you an AO game unless they note and take issue with one of the specific qualities e.g. explicit nudity that can earn one rating over the other. So in that sense R and AO effectively function in the exact same way when you ignore the one year shift in magic age that doesnt actually have any realworld power.yes there are always niche obscure exceptions. but whatever.,Steam,cojwa3j,1,t5_2qwis

3169802,0,t1_cop80oi,That is an intriguing and reasonable question. Im pleasantly surprised I was half expecting a defensiveaggressive response and very much hoping I wasnt crushing your ambitions.Before I can answer it though I need to have a better idea of what your idea is the core concepts the design specifications the end goal and what is the minimum viable product would be. To do that I dug deeper into the available content on youtube your website the steam discussions and just short of downloading and playing the game. Im still not sure I have a good grasp of what your intent is so you may need to provide additional clarification or think about how to narrow down your focus.In watching the alpha gameplay by Randomise User I realized that there was a decent bit more depth to your existing game than was apparent from the media Id already seen. I notice that youve already replaced the four videos that were on the Greenlight page with one that looks much better and more enticing. It still starts off a little slow and bland but at least it looks like a playable game and not a static concept walkthrough. The fish attack and submarine death was a very nice touch though Im left wondering if theres any defense against that?How important is it for you to get the unfinished game on Steam as Early Access now versus the complete version later? I can think of half a dozen reasons why someone might but Id like to hear from you why this is important. Some of the things you can get from it can be gotten in other ways that dont turn your game and your time into a marketing or popularity contest. I dont see this gamegetting the wide acclaim of a triplea title or the community of Minecraft or Kerbal Space Program so you should probably focus on your niche.I was going to suggest looking at a couple of trailers for Kerbal Space Program to get an idea of how to showcase things and what to show. Searching YouTube and sorting by views shows the KSP Build Fly Dream Trailer fan made? starts out really slow with some intriguing theme music shows a few interesting sights and then builds up speed very quickly and starts showing lots of things the player can do and see. It also shows off quite a bit of personality with their little green men the explosions of failure and the plethora of options. If you go back to one of their earliest official videos the Kerbal Space Program Promo youll see some of the same things as an instructional video yet showcased as fun entertaining and creative and cutting out most of the wait between events.Going back to your original question what do I work on this week  what is your first priority?Representation of game features is definitely your biggest weak point right now but that only matters if Greenlight matters. The marketing can wait until closer to release this does sound like a oneman development shop so you have to prioritize a lot more than game studios that have people doing nothing but marketing. You could find some play testers and other game developers for early cycle feedback.You may find yourself losing track of time as you push the limits discover new things and unlock new abilities. What limits? What things? What abilities? As in writing is also true in games games are often a story in a different medium Show Dont TellIn one hypothetical week  Spend a day or so looking at the big picture. What are the core play aspects how do they interact why are they there and what does the player get out of them. Whats the point of research? Do the crystals and you are stranded story matter? What are the pros and cons of submarine death or battery limit? . Spend half a day adding a ocean ceiling sky or space texture of some sort just try getting away from the pure white light of infinity. If it doesnt look okaybetter after leaving there for a day or two then take it back out change textureeffect andor look how other games do it.  Based on the previous big picture thoughts find those elements in the game and showcase them. Create gameplay footage and put them into a video for display. The current video on Steam Greenlight is a good start.  Find a few testers who are into exploration type games and solicit their feedback. Ask them what they liked and didnt like. What would they like to see more of and why. Prepare a few questions after initial openended feedback to look for specific things more fish? more customization? different animal behavior?.

3173890,0,t3_2wg2k2,My suggestionsThere should be a limit on how many friend invites you can send per day. At least on new accounts. Additionally we should be able to report invite spam and the accounts sending them should be autoblocked from adding people for a set amount of time maybe a week? after a certain amount of reports. If you get invite banned too often you should be permabanned from inviting people but preferably manually by Valve to avoid false positives.Alternatively or maybe additionally some options for limiting who can invite you would be nice. Maybe multiple options such as whitelisting friends of friends people youve played in the last X days only accounts older than X daysweeksmonthsyears accounts above a certain level accounts with more than X paid games or with games in common with you.,Steam,coqz0rj,14,t5_2qwis

Im gonna wait for a couple more days and then dispute it on PayPal... Ive got a couple of friends that have bought a good amount of games from there as well but after this Im gonna warn them.Its much better if you buy steam gifts there since when you do with ga shield they directly oversee you using the gift link so in case something goes wrong they have to fix it right away instead of you having to wait for their terrible support.,Steam,corbz0m,2,t5_2qwis

Crashes on certain configurations and waiting around for patches is simply part of PC gaming. Once you buy a title any troubleshooting is left between you and the developerpublisher. You say you contacted Ubisoft support but did Devs seem active and involved on the Steam forums... have you tried contacting them directly? Also the game is still in active development... Its hard for me to believe that the devs would simply say There is no fix goodbye.

So I jumped on it! Watching all the videos and bench marks most games are  on high... Obviously new games are medhigh but still look far better than a console. Plus its rift compatible too From what I have seen the i variant is actually faster the i and i in many cases. Older games  years plus seem to run better on the i due to its higher clock speed and HT. i is . while i and i are . ... You can also over clock the GPU and DigitalFoundry did a great test on  Alienware configurations using Metro LL BF ETC and displayed how close the i OC GPU to an I OC GPU difference was  or  frames if that.

The only reason I got the i is Im going to use it for some emulators transcoding etc and the i is a little better at those things.If you can get an i with staff discount... Buy it!

3430949,0,t3_2ppobk,Would love for valve to fix this instead of adding more trash features we dont need on steam at all like social media type crap and streaming. There are plenty of other places that are light years better at these things yet they still put all their time and effort into these while leaving the core features of steam riddled with bugs.Sick of checking downloads every now and then and seeing them being scheduled i have had scheduling disabled since the day it was added yet it still schedules absolutely everything. The reason i fell in love with steam a decade ago was because it kept my games updated and ready to go when i wanted to play them this download scheduling crap completely ruins that and disabling said feature doesnt disable it.If they really want to save bandwidth they should make scheduling or delayed updates mandatory for people with no paid games on their account but still give us users with several thousand dollars worth of games on our accounts the ability to have updates work like they did when we first started using the service.When steam detects an update for a game i want it downloaded the second it finds it not when i go to play said game or when i open the download tab and see several updates being scheduled. If i wanted download scheduling i would enable it however i do NOT want it thus the reason i have it disabled.This has been a bug since the second they added this feature if they cant fix this bug then get rid of it completely until they do.,Steam,cpjcra8,2,t5_2qwis

I assume they would leave out some key files that are small but let users download all the assets which is the majority of the size. They are likely also encrypted but even if they are not you would not be able to do anything without the complete files especially not in one week.Much more likely is the full game gets leaked onto torrent sites which seems to happen on a more regular basis but then again its not like people are desperate to even get a glimpse at GTA since its already out on console. ,Steam,cq4iw3m,10,t5_2qwis

3628591,0,t1_cq5v0w7,The lack of online sucks but its not like this blindsided anyone. From the very start when the Steam store page came up it was known that online would be staggered from launch. Its lame but it wasnt hidden away or anything it was clearly stated. If its as big a miss as youre stating then dont buy or you shouldnt have bought the game until its included. I mean if this is just a launching pad for your other gripes for the port then thats another thing entirely. The missing currentgen effects are a bummer who knows why they chose this mix of lastgen and currentgen to base the port upon. Personally Im missing the two extra stages and clothing destruction more as the soft engine effects are subtle enough to be hard to discern seeing direct comparison footage but despite all that you still get the incredible image quality that only a PC can provide.But maybe wait until some months pass and some sales come and go. Whos to say these packs wont have deep discounts? For the time being the price to cosmetic content ratio isnt out of the ordinary. ,Steam,cq5vy33,5,t5_2qwis

3651099,0,t1_cq88gah,Preload caches are basically raw chunks downloaded from content servers. All chunks are encrypted. The only difference with a preload is the cache key is withheld while with a regular download chunks are decrypted and decompressed to file segments when downloaded instead of being stored. There is indeed compression thats how you get roughly  compression ratio with Unity engine games. However it seems developers like to encrypt stuff these days so Steam itself is unlikely to provide much compression.,Steam,cq8gac9,1,t5_2qwis

If I had to pay that much money for all those mods I simply wouldnt. You think that many people actually would? Whats the point in making mods if no one is going to play them? That might sound like its exaggeration or speculative but people are only going to play mods that they can afford or simply not pay at all. Modders are going to become opposed to each other in an ecosystem which was originally meant to be more communicative and supportive. If someones making money off your mod you can have their version not gain money anymore. It makes everything more vicious and businesslike when it was originally people just collaborating and working together with each others content.Not only that but what happens if I buy a mod which is incompatible with another and dont get to test within  hours? Im out the money because they dont work together. Or even if I do get to test within  hours what if the mod doesnt work in my immediate playtime?What happens if the mod author up and leaves the mod and then the game is updated and the mod breaks?

Why not charge the modder for uploading the mod and the costs associated with the download. Watch how modding is limited to the people who can do it. We are heading into a new way of doing business. Being in my s I see the old ways are quickly dieing out. The free mods ads and full rebust games that didnt need DLC. Online is a capitalist and not a socialist world.

The OP has put up discussion regarding on how VAC could be wrong and from my side I have stated about Bayes theorem that could show you that even in such high accuracy engine I dont know about VAC it may be higherlower than  there is still huge possibility of falseflag.VAC is not infallible. This has been evidenced many times when VAC bans have been overturned. This means that a procedure exists to review and reverse VAC bans when a mistake is made. This also implies that when no action is taken the VAC ban is probably deserved. Of course every single cheater in the world claims that they werent cheating and were falsely banned. Doesnt mean its true every single time.Expecting technically or logistically difficult and vindictive measures to sate your curiosity seems pointless.

MOST of the reviews from the group are honest  the problem is that what this man has done has basically slapped everyone that participated in this in the face. Its embarrassing sure but theres more to the story here than whats on the surface. People have been bullied threatened and there have been organized attempts to ruin reviewers reputations and do everything possible to reduce the visibility of legitimate reviews. This simply because people didnt bend to the will of one person.

Just remember that ALL other avenues must be exhausted first Steam Support online over the phone emailing Gabe whatever other options there may be.

One set of games on sale for  hours one set on sale for  hours so three of those sets a day and flash sales every  hours  could be wrong but this is what I remember from the holiday sale.. Ive never seen a game fo on sale twice in one sales event. However a lot of fhe games that are discounted in the  hour sales will get lowered even more for a limited time and then go back to the previous sale price. . This one Im not sure on but from experience the best stuff is in the flash sales and the last couple days. But seriously do no worry about the sale prices or missing something. There are  or more big sales events a year and I always see the same stuff get dropped to the same price everytime Garrys Mod for . Skyrim for  franchise pack  and below etc.So if you see something on sale this time and miss it it will be crazy low again in  months. Dont worry.

Instead Ill just tell you just one of my problems with War Thunder currently it is the lack of an improvement in the User Experience UX design especially communications systems the Tmenu. It is utterly useless for RB Ground especially considering that you have no way of visually identifying enemies and calling them out for allies and no way to actually request direct fire support. In fact it is nigh difficult for your allies to know where you are when youre spamming Cover me when youre being shot at. In fact the Tmenu is horribly unspecific about providing context to your teammates.One of the important things in any multiplayer meta is teamwork and there is barely any of it in War Thunder.  If you could get WT to have more mechanisms to encourage teamwork thatd definitely improve the game.Ok thats all I got to say. Have a great weekend.,Steam,cs4jtbk,1,t5_2qwis

4285761,0,t3_3a25jv,I think it depends on what interests you tbh. Each game tends to lean more in one direction but still has all the elements of magic and technology. Games before FF are a lot more magic based and have a more traditional fantasy feeling. FF is a lot more technical and futuristic. FF Id say is more modern without being hyperfuturistic. FF is probably more political and indepth.As a starting point though Id recommend FF. I havent played the new version so I cant speak for the voice acting or the new graphics. But the story is pretty classic Final Fantasy. And a lot of the elements in the story continue to crop up in games later in the series crystals airships Cid dragoons chocobos moogles etc. and if you continue to play FF youll appreciate the little throwbacks a lot more. ,Steam,cs8q56f,1,t5_2qwis

4294984,0,t3_3a6oe0,If anyone is considering Creativerse you should know it is in early access and it will be free to play upon release. That being said its worth the purchase if you want to support the developers who are very active and receptive to feedback from the community. Its an underrated game as it is often overlooked by those who dismiss it as another minecraft clone. While it doesnt deviate far from the minecraft formula at the core I think it is much more polished and has a more interesting selection of blocks than minecraft. One huge plus is that it is extremely easy to play with online with your friends unlike the headache of setting up a server with minecraft. Its as simple as joining a friends world through steam. It doesnt yet have as much content as minecraft but the regular updates are promising. In short if you are looking for a good alternative to minecraft and you want to support a great development team its well worth the money.,Steam,cs9rmhd,14,t5_2qwis

4592197,0,t1_ct98oal,gt But even you couldnt possibly defend Temper Tantrum  which simply swaps a skin and an environment in its predecessorI am not defending the game. I am simply against this notion if you use things from the asset store you are not worth anything. Because that is cutting off possible games prematurely. For many devs this is the only way to get into the gamedev scene without spending tens of thousands of dollars. Because that is the amount that it costs to make a game with original art.gtBut when most of the game is taken from elsewhere? No. The programmer who does the backing should not be given all the profit sans VALVe for that game.Bull. And excluding Valve does not count. They have a large Team of Artists. Those assets are there to be bought to make it possible for people to make games. Your cant dismiss a good game based on where its assets are coming from unless they are stolen. Which is not the case if you buy them. Example is Rimworld. They use the assets from Prison Architect with their permission and is very successful.    ,Steam,ct9fvf9,-2,t5_2qwis

Nowadays the only time that Valve removes a game from sale is when the amount that Valve has to pay out in refunds exceed the amount of money it has made.

4909050,1,t3_3i4cwr,Im sorry but these numbers are wrong. I mean I believe you saw  games tagged with Zombie but its poorly presented and other statistics dont mean anything.To start with Tagging is a fairly new feature.  With your realease date breakdown youre not showing an increase in Zombietagged games only that some games released before  have been tagged with ZombieAnd what are Neutral reviews? Steam only has Positive or Negative either side can be included in the funny tab tough that doesnt make them neutral. EditAnswered Neutral stood for games with Mixed reviewsAlso how did you get  games tagged as Action out of  games tagged as ZombieNext time please take my feedback as only  opinion and keep at it I suggest comparing two numbers you measured the same way at about the same time with the same circumstances. Like games tagged as Zombie and games not tagged as Zombie. I think you might want to break that last one down further with games tagged but not as Zombie and games without any tags. ,Steam,cudbmct,3,t5_2qwis
4909457,0,t3_3hb7h5,Question Computer was hijacked while afk. Long story short lost  from PayPal converted to steam wallet funds which were then sent to another account over the market. Can I get my money back?So earlier today I was feeling tired so I decided to lay down for a few hours. When I came back to my PC I was utterly confused as I saw steam chat windows opened with what looked like myself asking a friend to give me their knife so I could use it for a little bit. I also saw that my skype had been opened and that this person had messaged someone on there as well. What most shocked me though is that google chrome had been opened to reveal my Facebook page opened.Alarmed I quickly went to my friend that had been messaged by me for answers he sent me the chat history and I knew that my computer had been hijacked. I investigated further into what this person could have done and I saw that none of my items were missing but I did notice I had two more items in CSGO. I checked my transaction history and sure enough  had been added to my steam wallet and two  purchases had been made on two skins for CSGO.Ive sent in an unauthorized payment complaint to PayPal and I even sent in a steam support ticket. I know that it will probably take a while for me to get a reply from either of these companies and Im looking for a quicker answer as my situation seems to be different from just a normal hijacked account.Ive seen on a few other instances that steam was able to determine that an account has been hijacked but in my case my whole computer was hijacked so it looked as if I did all of this right at home on my own PC. Because of this am I able to receive a refund? The only evidence I have is the chat history that had been created while my PC was hijacked and the transaction history along with the account that had posted these items up on the market.Transaction made on market Transaction made into my steam wallet funds Just because of the way that the guy got this money makes me very skeptical if Im going to be able to get the money back at all.,Steam,cuddgw7,1,t5_2qwis

They has platform that is numerous times bigger than anything Epic ever did and ever will do and with more features that Epics ever developed through whole lifetime of their company. Plus couple of extremely popular games which they provide support for years yeah unlike Epics too. Plus Valve has documentation and provide extensive support for developers but community is left in the dark because its out of their scope. The problem is exactly in Source  SDK which sometimes requires a ton of effort and communication with Valve. Because its not doing what you expect it to do half of the time and is very unfriendly. Also Valve never considered their engines mainly to make money unlike Unity or UE which were created for a single thing  make money. Its just more commercially efficient to use Unity or UE. Yeah I understand while people will prefer UE or Unity but I never understand why people blames Valve who brought PC gaming back from the dead. They cant do everything. Its not fanboism people just expect unrealistic things from other people. Its nothing but entitlement. Valve is not company that sells amazing easytouse engines never was and never will obviously.

I personally love retro style games   bit  bit nessnes era games.  This is not that.Changing the art style doesnt fix the lack of animation either.  For a twitch platformer you need smooth consistent fluid animation.  For other things it can be a little sloppier but it needs to respond well.Id just like to point out the problem isnt the backgroundsblocks.  The characters are.  Rather than updating with a million unique characters focus down onto a handful and get them well madeanimated before continuing.  Even at twodozen levels with well made characters Id drop  on it for two hours of enjoyment.  It looks fun.  It just doesnt look.I know at  you cant really outsource but there are a bunch of artists who are willing to work for free on a small project.  Otherwise just spend some more time working on it.

Im also going to acknowledge so that you cant the fact that Ive been upvoted. It happens. People misuse things but that doesnt mean its okay. People use the words faggot retard and autistautistic for meanings that arent their own. Regardless of the fact theyve entered the vernacular of the Internet that doesnt make them okay to use. It just means a lot of people are using it.Once again the fact that the Reddiquette is present under all reply boxes means it is worth reading.

5223860,0,t3_3mjg76,In addition the Recent News section should be overworked. Community Announcements are useful but more often thant that there are questionable news articles from PC Gamer Rock Paper Shotgun or  Kotaku that shouldnt be the first thing I see when viewing at a game in my library. Its not about the sites in particular but that they often feature things not necessarily important to the game or are actually infusing clickbait in the feed. With games that have no DLC or Achievements the News feed even slides into a more prominent spot.It also blurries the line between actual announcements and news articles. Worse these articles can push out important announcements. I guess many devs would love a way to communicate important things more prominently on the library page aswell.All in all I think the actual library page for each game leaves a lot to be desired.,Steam,cvfo0cf,2,t5_2qwis

5729062,0,t3_3t0mlu,So earlier today I was having some issues with steam when i noticed my steam games were deleted after an updated. I was planning on looking for the games through my files when I then noticed a few programs are missing from the taskbar. I have checked using the tools in properties and my hard drive is showing there is now errors.,Steam,cx78v2l,1,t5_2qwis
5729489,0,t3_3t0mlu,Hi all. Im running steam on a pretty ok computer running FO on medium settings just fine no problems. Im streaming to my media computer which is connected with one of those electrical plug networks. Never have any speed problems netflix runs fine in HD and speed tests are about the same as on my main gaming computer.When I run streaming the feed freezes the sounds gets all techoy for a few seconds but the funny thing is that the game still responds to my keyboard imputs. So when playing FO I can pause the game while the freezing happens usually from s  s and then go back to playing. The freezing happens sporadically and changing my streaming settings has no effect other than making the game look shittier or better. Still freezes the same amount of time. The two games I play are Civ and FO and it happens about the same amount of times on both games.Here is something too the freezing on Civ seems to happen when im making a move....almost never when the computer is moving.Any suggestions? Thanks all!,Steam,cx7aro3,1,t5_2qwis

5754232,0,t3_3txs2u,After updating to Windows  when entering Big Picture mode pressing right andor down on the keyboard or any other input like steam controller or xbox  controller causes a stuck state as if that directionbutton is being held down. Only way out is AltF. I unplugged everything except my keyboard and mouse same issue. No problem in Desktop mode or any other program.EDIT Ive now noticed that it exhibits this stuck behavior even without any input. I just booted up BPM and after a few seconds the menu selection slams downright. EDITThis wouldnt be a big deal since I prefer desktop mode except that the only way to adjust steam controller settings is via Big Picture. Any thoughts on how to diagnosefix this? Or alternatively is there another way to adjust Steam Controller settings besides Big Picture?FIX EDIT tracked the problem down to two vJoy entries in Device Manager.

5906817,0,t1_cxtwl0y,The app probably got stuck in a loop trying to exit and failing to do so.Have you tried killing the process instead of requesting it to end? If so or if that fails reboot your PC. It will clear out the memory and since you uninstalled Steam it wont be able to start up again. Hopefully it would be very weird if something got left behind.Then after that just reinstall Steam and you should be OK.Good luck!,Steam,cxtx0jt,2,t5_2qwis

A person with  games will get boosters more often than one with  different games regardless of what particular games are owned.Think of it as more of a list. When any badge is made a list of user is queried a user is selected then a booster of an eligible game for that user is given. Ive been given a booster for a game that didnt have a new crafted badge listed via Spy and others have very rarely been given boosters for games that have cards but arewere disabled for crafting Are you Smarter than a th Grader was the most recent example I can find. If a user hasnt received a booster in some time a weight modifier is attached to them artificially increasing their level until a drop is achieved.Further example Ive been given a booster every Monday within a few hours discrepancy which accounts for people getting above me in the list via more games and higher level for the last few months.,Steam,cxwsygb,2,t5_2qwis

It feels very plasticy its just that a wired Xbox controller or DS are better for most games you will likely play.I really wanted to like the steam controller and yes it does allow you to emulate a mouse and play games that would normally be difficult or impossible with a controller but it doesnt feel natural to me and quite honestly the steam link games I play dont really require the added functionality of the steam controller and frankly the experience is better using another controller.I believe it will get better but my advice would be a DS while we wait for the steam controller to mature a bit.  Your steam link game selection may be a bit smaller but your experience with these games will be better with a superior controller.,Steam,cyd1pyz,1,t5_2qwis

That sounds like its really similar but those are just a few aspects theres a lot of other stuff that goes in to both of those games that makes them unique.Why do people think Im calling them the same game? I never implied it was a clone just that there was an actual reason why Minecraft would be suggested as the interests in both games overlap.

Getting rolled in starcraft when playing on the competitive ladder is hard to take sometimes but if I jump into some unranked games I feel infinitely less pressure to perform and have a lot more fun doing so. On the other end of the spectrum in Rocket League I have fun even if im getting steamrolled in the competitive matchmaking because I feel like the game has less of a serious stressed out at all times vibe to it. ,Steam,czdzwus,1,t5_2qwis

The hacker got into his account through a password change request after getting his emails password then he got in changed both the email to change the password and the password itself.

6859250,0,t3_49op30,Apologies for this incoming rant but I have to address this can people please stop spreading this misinformation that Steam needs to be connected after some arbitrary amount of time to revalidate itself or whatever?  This comes up every time someone has an issue with offline mode and I have no idea why because its simply flatout not true.  No one can ever link to any sort of official knowledge base or FAQ to substantiate it yet so many people insist that its true based on random personal anecdotes.  Here this is a Valve employee setting the record straight  Offline Mode is designed to be indefinite.And if you want a personal anecdote to support this heres mine  I still have an old WinXP box that hasnt been connected to the internet since last April that I still use to play some Steam games in offline mode.  Thats nearly a year and I havent had any issues with it yet.So please stop saying this.  Its false and it does nothing to help anyone when you suggest it.  If someone is having connection issues with offline mode all of a sudden  of the time its an issue on the users end.  There are many reasons this can happen.  Maybe they briefly connected online and Steam downloaded an update and then went offline again before it was applied.  Maybe they tried to play a game that had not been fully validated before attempting to play it offline.  Maybe they used a Disk Cleanup utility that cleared out there login ticket.  Etc etc.  Maybe in  of those instances Steam just randomly bugged out and stopped working.  It happens.  But I promise you in precisely zero circumstances has this ever been because Steam has been offline for too long and needed to phone home.  ,Steam,d0tszs2,9,t5_2qwis

I used the market mostly because it was there I sold duplicate cards I got from playing games and I used the pennies I got from that to pay for premium currency in Warframe which I liked. It just pisses me off that theyre making me wait for two bloody weeks for p when before Id get it in the same day. For those CSGO skins that cost something ridiculous like  I understand something like that even though I think its sad and a little scary someones willing to pay for it but for a virtual card that costs pocket change?Besides that though Id rather be on GOG because I respect the company more but unfortunately they havent got the enormous library that Steam has and even if it did all my games are on Steam already.

With a stolen credit card you still have your name on it and you still have access to the card and can still call the company and they can stop that card because they still control that money.

They take almost no effort to make.Some mates and I made one we never actually released it and the effort to make it was far far less than we had anticipated at first. It was about  hours long if you let the text scroll on its own or about  minutes if you forcefilled the text for each dialogue and bothered to read it.A single person with mediocre art skills can learn the necessary programming or Hell use Flash in a very short amount of time and after in a couple weeks could churn out a mediocre VN by doing a small amount of work on it each day after their normal job.If they sell for  and sell  copies that dont get returned they get  after Steams cut. That isnt bad money for  hours of work estimating based on the amount of combined time my mates and I spent on the project. The worst part would be learning the basics of programming but those skills would carry over to the next mediocre shoverware VN they made.If a person turned it into a fulltime job its very realistic to be able to pull a very livable wage by creating shovelware VNs. Once sales begin to slip as people begin to realize your company produces poor content you start using a new company name at which point sales pick up again.Theoretically if you price it right and it doesnt even matter if the company name is shamed because people will still buy it just to see.Weve never actually released it as I said but we could and believe me for the effort we all put into it being able to grab  each from it has tempted us more than a few times. The kicker of it is that from the research we did even the bad VNs have long tails so its likely that  would be on the low end.,Steam,d2n0ccr,9,t5_2qwis

Im not really familiar with ds settings to know which ones are CPU dependant but if you can monitor your CPU usage while the game is running you can try different things to lower your CPU usage freeing up as much power as possible for encoding the video stream.,Steam,d361iij,2,t5_2qwis

Star Wars fans are not looking for a way to get around paying for Star Wars media and merch. When choosing to be strict with potential piracyor building goodwill with fans for Star Wars its an obvious choice.,Steam,d45xhd3,1,t5_2qwis

We do agree that we are guilty and feel terribly sorry for developers and players. Developers cannot delete other peoples reviews only hide them Which just collapses the review with a message saying its hidden with a link that unhides it for you. The only way to accomplish this would be control over the bots to make each one delete its own review.

8061275,0,t3_4pjbsz,Thank you OP. I already bought some games from Steam and took a long look at getting either Lost World or Generations as my last purchase last night. For a little bit more than half the price of one of those games why not have them all? Whats Sega thinking process with this? Why reward people who did a small bit of research and charge  times the amount for those that didnt? Its not cool. ,Steam,d4m5vel,2,t5_2qwis
8061452,0,t3_4pm19w, gtSteam doesnt have the best deals anymore buying stuff on Steam means spending almost twice if not more the price you were about to spend somewhere else for the same game. I want to shop at Steam but i just cant anymore.Third party developers and publishers can set their own sale prices on Steam and they have to consider VALVE getting  of a sale made on there. Im not sure of what the markup is EVERYWHERE else. gt This year Sale so far for me have been just boring empty and uneventfulThis just goes to show how people were more focused on the gimmicky GAME of buying.

This is an issue this week because of TinyBuild who flatout refused to help GA figure out if any of the keys were being illegally trafficked. When youre a developer claiming to have been scammed out of half a million dollars thats a strange position to take and a huge hint that theres more going on than theyre revealing.EA and Ubisoft are both major companies that have been hit by credit card fraud scandals you can bet they have the money and political clout to go after GA if theres even a possibility that they could be found legally accountable. And they havent because it was more profitable for them to direct blame toward resellers and give out a few free keys. If this kind of fraud were happening on the huge scale that people are saying that it does that GA is fundamentally about fencing stolen goods the site would not exist.

I tend to do this with games that are expensive it would be a waste if I paid  for a game that I cant run.As to how the refunds work you request a refund and you get a confirmation email that it has been requested.

As for EA they have an extremely expensive and profitable production contract with Lucasfilm. Likewise EA has done what they felt they needed to do and if I were in the same position I hope I would also do anything to protect my golden egg.

8590967,0,t1_d6fdcfe,I mean its irrelevant it may aswell be server crashes for NMS because people just straight up cant play it in most of the reviews i read. But it really doesnt matter a huge amount. Its a launch. They are giving software that had never seen the light of day to tonnes and tonnes of people. Theres going to be problems especially with a small studio.I dont agree that they should charge any less. because by all means atleast as far as i have seen the good reviews are singing the games praises. i think the game is worth it they just need some time to iron out the launch issues. HENCE why people should never ever ever ever pre order.and to be fair to them. they did completely change the game last minute. Adding in tonnes of new features and mecahnics and changing a lot of the fundamental functions in a day one patch. So it makes sense that they didnt want reviews of the previous version to dictate sales of the new version.Although i cant help but think that they were getting a negative response with their first version and rushed in a few new mechanics to add depth. because pre day one patch the game felt very very shallow from all the descriptions and gameplay,Steam,d6fgljy,1,t5_2qwis

With often less than optimal results i.e. chosing an much used sourceover a rarely used one. This makes an manual selection method desireable.Despite customer complaints since fall  this has not yet implemented byValve. sfsselect tries to offer that possibility.It allows you to temporatrily disable single sharing sources. That way you candisable a in use library in favor of unused ones. Additionally it can tweakthe way steam uses to assign games to the active sources.It has both a GUI for casual use and a CLI scripting desktop shortcuts... mode.

8651566,0,t1_d6n0vg0,I had already adjusted the colors very slightly to be less poopy its much better already idd   You are also the second person to mention it kinda looks like UPS totally unintended The achi refreshing needs some context it was one of the biggest challenges I met.  The problem with them is that I have to do an individual request to Steam for each game and then do depending on how many achievements a game has quite a bit of comparing to keep both my own database and your achievements in sync.  The original idea was to do it all in  go and that works for someone with lt games but there are users who own thousands of games and that would take way too long and the server would timeout.  So I had to make a Queue of games that I want to update.  The way it works now is you click the button and a job gets sent to the server to update your first game and you receive a message that the syncing has begun.  After the first job is done that same job sends another request to the server to start the job for the next game and so on.  The reason I do it like that besides not frying my server is that if  people are all updating their games at the same time everyone gets mixed in the queue and everyone goes about as fast. If I were to immediately add lets say  jobs for all your games every other user would have to wait until all of your games are updated before theirs get even started.  Jobs get handled by whats called a watcher and this guy just checks the Jobs database for any jobs sees one does it and continues watching for the next job.  Atm I have only  watchers but Im monitoring my server and the plan is to add more as long as the server can cope.  Im also considering jobs in batches of  or so but there are some technical hurdles before I can do that.  Like you said the idea is that users do a single big refresh and after that only update tracked games for a much faster experience About the stats page and achi filtering those were added really fast in the last  days so the flow isnt there yet. The filter button is badly named its basically a filter for ALL of the achis you can get and not a filter of the current subset.  However the filtering there is still very basic and I want to expand on it soon.  Thank you very much for your feedback edit Added a rd watcher p  edit Ive updated the filtering a bit now you can sort by rarity and earnedmissing achievements with the help of  dropdowns. Its not  yet but a lot better than before ,Steam,d6n24z0,5,t5_2qwis

At which point Ive been baffled how the hell someone can design an EXPLORATION themed game without a functional map with the ability to retrace your steps.I guess thatve been the final straw for me cause up to that point Ive been perfectly content with tryin to overlook the other issues Ive encountered searching for the other contents promised and told myself its okay it must be in the next system and Ive been just unlucky.I just dont get how the heck Steam did it when similar issues came up with that Batman game and how they dismiss valid concerns on No Mans Sky.Its bad business for them too and if you look at the player base numbers on this title its obvious that Im not some scammer cause that number keeps dropping sharply along with the reviews on steam so it should be obvious somethin aint right and so itd be time to revise this specific game and its promises against its delivered state.,Steam,d6w3ao5,3,t5_2qwis

Valve came around and realized it was distinctive enough to be sold as a seperate game instead and their only part in the whole development process was the Steamworks integration. Up to this day CSGO is still maintained by Hidden Entertainment. Valve only serves as their director.,Steam,d6xtr97,-53,t5_2qwis

9039015,0,t1_d7xzntl,Is it really? They actually put in the work to make sure the shit is great. Im sure they look at it from a long term view. Make great games sell more copies with each new game. Its more of a quality gt quantity thing with Rockstar as opposed to the rest which focus more on cashing in fast. Sure if you factor in all the new players and look at it then Rockstar sure looks like the minority. But if youre doing that you might as well forget what you were looking at because with all the new players  in the picture it is hardly the same thing it was before. Theyre not even in the same ballpark. Hell its not even the same sport. Different rules with different goals. So to me Rockstar is the norm when it comes to making great games which in return means cashing out big time. But thats because theres few other teams in the league and theyre also doing the same. They only become the minority and the exception  when the other teams are included. But its not even worth it to include them because all they want is to get you to give them as much money as possible while at the same time selling you a highquality shit product e.g. No Mans Sky.

9073118,0,t3_54jre0,If youre talking about Steamguard from a security standpoint two factor authentication makes a lot of sense. Having a second level of accountlogin verification tied to your phone something that most people have with them all of the time prevents someone from stealing your account. Even if they manage to guessforce your usernamepassword combination or get it through other means they would need to physically have your phone in order to gain access which is an unlikely scenario.Similarly with market transactions  it gives an extra level of protection. The market transaction confirmations are a bit annoying in my view but its all part of Valve covering themselves by creating a situation where your inventory is secured on top of the account security.Extra steps are involved but the result is more security for you.,Steam,d82fws5,6,t5_2qwis

If you have something on your system that modifies these files after verification youre in much deeper trouble than worrying about your games.And if you wanna go on about what great invention it is from Microsoft to put games in protected containers its a performance drain because it needs to be read and decrypted out of that container on the fly.

9511899,0,t3_5b2b9d,Steam always charges in main region currency meaning for Turkey I would have guessed it actually charges in EUR and its simply that your bank translates that to TRY. It does notify when you added your card that all prices are rough estimates in your local currency and may not always be perfectly accurate. I mean I guess Turkey could be a main region according to Steam but I dont think it is. Not saying you shouldnt pursue it because its always best to have that clear for the future regardless.

9793217,0,t1_dak37yi,gt Im supposed to have mbps of uploadOkay then its different but you didnt tell that in the first post.Bad wirring would affect both up and download so if yo ucan download okay thats not the problem.Check your drivers for motherboard  Netadapter. Maybe your router is messing with it ? Or a software firewall ?gt Why would it need to upload anyways?Actually for your pc to recieve a download it needs to constantly send upload small messages back to the site you download from. In this case steam. So thats why you will allways see steam use upload speed when you download or even only browse steam. You download a file in thousands of small packages and for each packet your pc send a thank you message back to the sender wich will allow the senbder to send a new package.Other than that steam collects info about your installed games to check for updates and news etc. So that use upload as well.Theres also a risk that some bad stuff on your pc use your bandwidth without showing it in logs.,Steam,dak85p5,2,t5_2qwis

Steam has linux support for about  of their titles and that doesnt mean they run as well as they do on Windows. However if you find one of these things dirt cheap it is very much possible to buy a Windows License and install it instead of using SteamOS to get full support for the whole steam library.

Biggest pain in the ass made it not worth it at all. But now at least you can select a bunch of trades then confirm them all in one go.Also I use this firefox extension that lets me select a bunch of cards in my inventory at once then auto price them to be  cent less than how much that card goes for in the marketAlso it is kind of a hassle for your email to be filled up with  emails from valve telling you that some guy bought you  cent card.

10193059,0,t3_5luuah,Honestly what the fuck does Valve even do anymore to justify its existence as a company? They dont curate or regulate the Steam platform they dont develop any game besides rebalancing DotA  and thinking up TF updates at a glacial pace they just sit back and collect money from their warped cosmetic and trading card system.  Theyre literally just riding the massive tidal wave of goodwill left over from HalfLife  and the earlier days of TF and the fact that Steam had no competent competitors for a very long time so people have Steam Friends and a purchase history tied up in there that they dont want to move away from.  But if Valve came out with Steam today with the current state of things as they are... very few would move to it.Honestly shit company as Ubisoft is UPlay isnt flooded with garbage and has more interesting metaelements to their client.  At least you can earn actual rewards for playing their games instead of ths of a badge.  Origin isnt as bad as it used to be either and of course GOG Galaxy takes the pain out of updating DRMfree games manually.If Valve is unwilling to take care of its platforms then we ought to buy games from people who have different ideas of what it means to have a sales platform.  But of course no one will because just like people buying Bethesda games even though their company has shit business practices just like people buying Season Passes just like preordering games... it will never stop because consumers are weakwilled.,Steam,dbzftui,0,t5_2qwis

Steam should hire you as head of CS because you know more than them...After my snarky nd comment I got another unrelated auto message followed by an Internal Review message later in the day where a real person finally answered my questions... And they said individual titles in THIS bundle could be refunded by themselves and even told me where to check on my own like you mentioned... And so I did and it only listed the individual game not the entire bundle list of games... So I went ahead and tried to refund a glitchy game from the bundle aaaaand whole bundle revoked from my account.Gotta love it when I cant even trust the answers from Steam.I just opened a new ticket asking for a refund reversal since I acted on their false answers.

According to the PCGamingWiki page that may be because of UPlays cloud synch. It says on there that There are reports of lost game progress. Preemptively disable Uplay Cloud saving in order to prevent bad synchronization. and there are some people on Steam Community discussions saying the same although some say it doesnt work for them. Also there is a post on this Steam Community discussion detailing how to restore game saves which still exist but have the .DELETED extension which apparently means UPlay ignores them.Thank you for sparing me oh merciful one I will sacrifice a thousand goats in your honor.

They were free helped the devs by finding bugs and issues and let you check out a new game that not everyone can play Ahh the ol NDAs. It sucks but you can see why they keep doing this EA stuff  it still makes plenty of money but with that We release updates weekly! and the defense of Its just an Alpha what do you expect? from nay sayers its hard to really hold them accountable if they fail to deliver what they say they will.I hope for CEs sake it does well it looks cool and Id love to play it.

Bubble burst salaries flatlined during layoffs engineering and CS programs at universities got waxed.  Heres some dataNotice the peak is  exactly  years after the bubble burst.  Did the qualified American high school population of CS nerds all of sudden go extinct?  Of course not if youre bright and ambitious and technical there are a ton of fields that are available to you.If your argument is that Apple Google et al need thousands and thousands of AI computer vision robotics experts to do research yeah theyd need to look abroad.  I would at least hear you out.  Bang out code at the newgrad level?  Yeah that can be done by anybody whos been in the industry for a few years.  As every single one of my posts in this thread has noted the applicant pool includes people with experience.  But they wont work for k in the bay area.  The firms in the valley have a residential real estate pricing issue not a tech shortage issue.Note this isnt exclusive to software engineering it happens periodically in all sorts of fields.  The same worker shortage school enrollment increase foreign visa increase and subsequent employment and education bust happened in nursing as well.,Steam,ddlicjt,1,t5_2qwis

10764473,0,t3_5tsqp4,A couple years back I purchased modern warfare  from a third party site I dont remember the site or anything but it had me download MW through steam. It installed fine and had no issues however I had a slow PC then and it couldnt handle MW. A couple days ago now that i have a new PC I downloaded MW while I slept and I woke up to the MERRYILOVEYOUBRUCE virus filling my PC. The virus originated from the Modern Warfare  folder. All my files were encrypted and my PC was ruined so I reinstalled windows. I have not downloaded MW again for fear that it will happen. Any ideas? Should I be okay to download it through steam again? I didnt have an antivirus program at the time maybe the virus got in and it didnt have anything to do with my steam download? Thanks!,Steam,ddq9xeo,1,t5_2qwis

10913458,0,t3_5vxklf,In the age of electronic communication most people do not like to wait any amount of time for help.  And generally when you are seeking help you are already not in a good mood because something went wrong.    I know people who get mad having to be put on hold for  minutes when calling into a company about an issue I think that is ridiculous myself systems take time to load call volume changes etc..    Now the other thing is when were the comments made? A bit over a year ago Steam Supports average response time was  weeks.  It wasnt good.  Steam has actively worked to fix this so in the past year response times have gotten much improved.    Another thing to consider is MOST Not all but most people dont take time to praise support of any kind when its done properly.  If you need help and cant get help you get angry and go rant on the internet.  This is mainly because whatever you were setting out to do you still cant do so you have more time to spend complaining about it.  Whereas if you need help get help as expected then your issue is resolved and you can continue with whatever you were doing when you first started seeking help.    Im kind of rambling but I think you get what Im saying.  People like to complain.  Support used to be worst.  If you expect something to work and it doesnt waiting days or weeks is seen as unacceptable.    Im still amazed that with over  Million Steam Accounts Valve has a very small staff and still gets most support issues resolved within a week or so.  ,Steam,de5n98p,13,t5_2qwis

11492213,0,t3_640q8l,Like previously stated its been going on sale a lot. I got mine on sale over a year ago now. Then bought my wife one at GameStop for not that much cheaper than what I paid for mine. I dont think its an indication of a nd controller coming out. I honestly dont see the need for a new one. At this point its only a few years old. Valve has no reason to make another one. Every upgrade can be done through software. We dont need a hardware change. Oh but people want a modular controller where you can swap out stuff? Everyone said the same thing about a modular cell phone and that never happened. Its gimmicky. And people still feel the steam controller is gimmicky already and they dont understand what it can do. Its better for more people to have only one steam controller so that people can master it more and be able to share what makes it so great to people who dont have it. Like the videos that get posted here of new ways to aim custom radial icons etc. we can make the steam controller the best there is we dont need a new one. ,Steam,dfyn3en,4,t5_2qwis

So the places its supported already wipes the floor. The number of ways you can configure said input before it even gets to the game  wipes the floor. The comfort. Once you are used to it other controllers seem almost useless. One Exception I love the N Controller and that was admittedly a pretty... out there... controller.Of my  Games According to Steam I use it for most of them Exceptions being games like RollerCoaster Tycoon amp Sequels where there is no good way to implement controller input  Yet.

I bought Witcher  on GOG to support them directly but I almost regret the decision because Im not interested in achievements not being tied to my main gaming platform.The best method of competition on PC game sales i believe is with rd party key sellers not the shady ones of course.I refuse to buy any EA game so origin is not an issue but having Ubisoft games sold on steam but tying achievements to their own system instead has prevented me from paying full price for their games and will continue to do so.,Steam,dge3vu4,3,t5_2qwis
11630670,0,t3_65veyq,Question Is a wired inhome streaming solution for me Building a new gaming desktop and using an old laptop to game on my couch and at friends houses?I want the powerperformance of a gaming desktop but the freedom of a laptop and I believe my best solution is to build a gaming desktop in conjunction with an old laptop  inhome streaming. If anyone has any other suggestions I would be happy to hear them.I have a few questions about how to maximize my performance with this setup . Is wired the best way to go? I envision having two long Ethernet cables and a Gigabit switch linking my desktop directly to my laptop . Regarding my KeyboardMouse or Controller can I reduce input lag by plugging them directly into desktop or does that not really matter?. If I plan to stream my gaming  of the time am I better off just sucking it up and investing in a good gaming laptop? . Does it matter what OS Im using? Windows seems to have the most support so my desktop will run Windows  and I would prefer to use Linux Ubuntu on my laptop but I am flexible on these OSs if there is a better solution.A little about my computer usage Generally I spend  of my time just browsing the internet on my laptop so Im currently using a seven year old Thinkpad if it turns out this laptop is too old to stream Im open to upgrading to some sort of cheap chromebook or something similar which gets the job done and Im content with. Most of my computing is done on my living room couch which is why Im streaming to a laptop instead of playing directly on the desktop. Occasionally Id want to game at friends houses but I dont think it would be too difficult to carry my desktop and dock it somewhere in their house. Im also interested in occasionally gaming on my TV but that seems pretty straight forward and my gaming desktop will most likely be permanently docked near my TV.Anyway Ive done a bit of research on my setup and it seems like I have everything figured out I just had a few final questions and would love to hear your thoughtsopinions. Basically Im looking for areas where I can improvetweak my setup. Thanks!Error Message NAGame NA.Platform MacPCLinuxOther,Steam,dgecknv,2,t5_2qwis

11712956,0,t3_674w4k,I heavily disagree with most of your statements.  I see people all the time in subs like rpcmasterrace also look how popular the sub is! ascending from consoles. K gaming isnt the only benefit.  PCs are only expensive if you make it expensive.  Since you can make PCs yourself they dont need to be cumbersome. Its not like consoles arent cumbersome either in that case.  PCs do not constantly break just like that if you take care of it.  Viruses are by user error.  You say needs upgrades when updates come out literally all the time for consoles as well and then manufacturers make a new console generation?  The points of the PS Pro and Xbox One S werent just for K gaming. Its also relatively new.  Also youre calling those affordable? And high powered? Im just going to assume youve never used a PC because of that second part.  You dont provide any points as to why those games  were better. Some of the Batman games had bad PC ports yes but those were fixed and originally it was by developer error.  Consoles get some exclusives but most of the time the game is also released on PC but not the other console.  Why do you feel like in the next few years theyll abandon? Elaborate? And if that why do you say  in the title then?  Why is it more fun? I can deny that. I used to be a console gamer but look now I mod rSteam. Controllers or something is why its more fun? PCs get more controllers than any console. Why are you stereotyping? Most friendlists are extremely large on Steam mine is almost filled and I manage a life in the outside world.  Why the hell did you bring virginity into this?  Why do you think we only care about FPS?  PC gaming is fun thats why we do it.  Good riddance to you too get this attitude off my platform.

It is true every work your create is yours from the moment you made it without having to do all the paperwork. Will contact OP or write something here when my friend responds.,Steam,dgv5d2a,19,t5_2qwis

My phone is a little bit lower in specs than the s and I consider that it works fine in daytoday tasks and handles most of the games just fine. Anyway I hope you will have the  to get something that suits your needs better and faster ,Steam,dgvg4nt,1,t5_2qwis

11800593,0,t1_dgxm27e,You make some fair points and I think were going to have to agree on some things and agree to disagree on others. One I think we agree that the holocaust was deplorable and Nazis are a blemish on the face of humanity. Two that the guy you saw deserved to be reported and penalized by Steam for his profile picture and username. I think where we start to disagree is the method for which the punishmentwarnings should be delivered and how much control should be out of human hands. But either way Im chalking this up as a win because I got another person on the internet to say McRacism Detector in a serious argument.Listen your intentions seem genuine and I know I must seem like a jerk for what Ive said but trust me when I say I hate Nazis as much as anyone else. Myself and my girlfriend would have been rounded up and deported or worse under the rule of Nazi Germany. Any kids I would have with her would be rounded up and deported or worse under that rule. I have no sympathy or patience for racial purity ideologies or Nazis. But regulating the symbols OF those things is where it gets blurry for me. Now Im gonna go try and get my last achievement on Bioshock Infinite which if you havent played I highly recommend since it has very strong themes involving racism and morality. Youre a good person. Im sorry if I was rude.,Steam,dgxmzak,2,t5_2qwis
11808058,0,t1_dgyh4vk,The thing that gets me is that Game of Thrones was literally the most pirated tv series up until HBO Go and HBO Now finally caught up and they provided the service untethered with a  a month satellite or cable TV subscription.Its proof the market is ready to pay content creators directly for shows and the massively bloated tv bundles arent saving anyone any money at all least of all the content creators themselves.,Steam,dgyhg24,3,t5_2qwis
11808778,0,t1_dgyf7gu,There are some people in the US that make . minimum wage fast food. A  game would be about  of monthly income.Granted thats poverty line and not middle class like your example but if something is  of your monthly income you probably arent going to buy a videogame every month. It might be a once or twice a year thing.,Steam,dgykdv9,3,t5_2qwis
