3421626,0,t1_cpi69lj,I agree with Cripps also because he didnt play many games last year and getting some consistent gametime will really aid his improvement,CarltonBlues,cpiagox,3,t5_31s46
5021782,0,t1_cur5pul,Well Fev set the standard for that kinda shit and hes still one of my favorite players to have suited up in navy. You can get away with a lot of you deliver on game day.,CarltonBlues,curbehd,1,t5_31s46
5374643,0,t1_cvy78ek,Pick  is off the table unless were getting a KPP for it. Henderson and now apparently Casboult are leaving. We need Weitering.,CarltonBlues,cvyo6oi,2,t5_31s46
5424549,0,t1_cw51504,Couldnt agree more. Im thinking the worst case senario is the most likely to happen. ,CarltonBlues,cw51jbq,2,t5_31s46
5451506,0,t1_cw7u81t,Seems as if Carlton now exists to develop players and then trade them on for the benefit of other AFL clubs Adelaide have got two lively forwards in Betts and Menzel not to forget the bad decision to trade Jacobs to them in . Melbourne have got Garlett who is a canny goalsneak. Brisbane have received Robinson and Bell. Geelong got Henderson. And now Richmond have paid unders for Yarran. Lets not forget the decision to give up Josh Kennedy to West Coast instead of Fevola. In return we have received draft picks for skinny kids and the overpaid underperforming Dale Thomas. The team next year will more resemble a Reserves team!,CarltonBlues,cw8hdap,2,t5_31s46
