It wasnt until Random Access Memories came out and I realized I remembered Julian from Boombox. After that I just looked up a bunch of songs on YouTube and became hooked.

2293990,0,t1_clv3ztr,Im glad you like it. That Have a Nice Life record CHANGED me. Thats a hard question to answer. The Strokes became popular at a time when pop music saturation made the public swing back around to liking rock music like it usually does every other decade. Julian and the gang affected a really cool s New York rock sound and blew up the scene. But with FIoE the sound changed a bit.  I think it just comes down to Julian. He is a meticulous songwriter. Even when the songs are simple you can guarantee hes put a lot of work into making it sound simple and catchy. And he has a good sense of what musicians to play with. Who is going to make his songs better. IDK. I could and have talked about this band forever.

10805240,0,t3_5uiq8o,Comedown Machine likely came from the song s Comedown Machine and Future Present Past EP came from the concept that each of the  songs on the EP were made to represent the different styles and sounds The Strokes will use are using and have used in their early albums with Drag Queen being an odd future sound OBLIVIOUS being their current sound and Threat of Joy being reminiscent of their early work like Is This It and Room on Fire. ,TheStrokes,dduhg9l,22,t5_2sho1

10850297,0,t3_5v33d3,Chances. Thread over or however they say.Also s comedown machine. I dont understand the disdain for that song. Its so dreamy. And it kicks off my favorite  minutes of nap music ever. Its MKUltra shit. Controls my brain. Better than a bumpy train ride for putting me to rest. I might be partial I listened to Comedown Machine on repeat while tripping acid one time I have deep love for the album now.,TheStrokes,ddz4qme,4,t5_2sho1

11723034,0,t3_679sft,Im with you. While room on fire has similar production qualities as ITI rhythm guitars distorted vocals I feel like it brings a different vibe. ITI had a nostalgic feeling with songs like the Modern Age Someday Hard to Explain... the melodies are so blissful and ... its just a euphoria.... I dont get that feeling with ROF somehow. I feel very good while listening to it but I almost get more of a sense of I dont care vibes than the i say I dont care but I do sweetness from Julian.Thats all kinda pretentious sounding but I did my best to explain how I feel the two are different ,TheStrokes,dgou3ya,13,t5_2sho1
