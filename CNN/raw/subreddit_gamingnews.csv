Also keep in mind that he is mostly speaking about Japanese gamers who are certainly starting to turn away from traditional consolesPCs in favor of social tabletphone gaming.That being said even here in the US I do notice a large contingent of young kids only playing celltablet games and really not having much interest in consoles or PCs.,gamingnews,cfylqpb,1,t5_2rsaw

My beliefs are unimportant...you have continually degraded an entire group because you think they are lesser.Furthermore your posts do in fact define you as a gamer. Now you can dispel it by saying youre a boyfriend and have a job but the crux of your argument was the fact that youre a gamer and they cant possibly be based on their tastes...The fact that you have that much emotionally and mentally invested in your selfimposed label shows how important it is to you,gamingnews,chc2pf9,2,t5_2rsaw

Because people keep pre ordering or buying these incomplete pieces of shit. Then theyll go out and buy the  worth of dlc just to add new skins.

9294906,0,t3_57ooe0,Transcript below because the site is shitgtYesterday we learned that the Xbox One was the top selling console in the US for the third month straight thanks to NPDs and now we have an idea how some of the games performed. According to sources the top three selling games in the US in September were NBA K Madden  and FIFA . NBA K apparently sold K at retail making it the biggest launch ever for a sports game and it was a  increase compared to last years version.gtMadden  sold K without bundles and K with bundles. FIFA  sold K which was down from last years version which sold K. If youre wondering how Forza Horizon  did then we can tell you that it sold around k. This is an ok number and you also have to take into account that it was only on sale for  days a few more if you count the Ultimate Edition. ReCore the other Microsoft first party game apparently sold less than K at retail which doesnt come as much of a surprise. Its safe to say that game is a bomb. Bioshock The Collection also apparently sold around as much as Forza Horizon  did which is great news.gtThanks to the PS Slim Bundles Uncharted  sold around K in the US last month and Grand Theft Auto V continues being a beast as it sold K which is up  compared to this time last year. That game truly has legs like no other game. To no ones surprise No Mans Sky sold around K in September which is down from over K in August.gtAs for a bit of hardware news the original PS model outsold the PS slim by a lot with around K sold of the Black Ops  Bundle compared to around K for the PS Slim. The Black Ops  bundle was selling for  like the slim and at some times  at some retailers. The DS sold more this September then it did in September  and a bigger surprise is that the PS sold around  last month which is more than the Wii U did which sold around . Those PS sales are up  on the year. The Xbox One sold  units in September which was up . from last year while the PS sold  which was down . from last year,gamingnews,d8u7276,5,t5_2rsaw
