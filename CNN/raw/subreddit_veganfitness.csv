2932780,0,t3_2tq3ue,This topic does seem to come up a lot  but in all honesty  it is a pretty simple equation to gain weightlean muscle mass by doing only  things.    knowing how to work out properly and  knowing how to eat properly  enough.  Both of those things involve being uncomfortable  sometimes to the point of tears andor nausea.  This means working out harder than you ever have and eating more than you ever have  when you are not hungry and eating past being full.  Most people dont work out that hard  look around the gym.  Maybe a few people are really killing it out of dozens.  You need to be that guygal  and then some.  Being lean and muscular is not for everyone  thats why so few look that way.  It is much easier to halfass workouts and diet and keep wondering why its so hard to gain weightmuscle.  It is not that difficult to come up with a  calday healthy vegan meal plan. It can be challenging to keep down all of that food though.    If people kind of try  they wont gain anything.  If people fully commit to working out properly with maximal intensity and deal with consuming a shitton of good calories  building lean muscle and gaining weight is very achievable.  It really is that basic.  If you dont want to work out uber hard and really get on top of eating a lot of good calories  then maybe the skinny physique is your calling.    not trying to be a dick  just being honest about it.  ,veganfitness,co1gw7h,7,t5_2smq8

7779975,0,t1_d3qbzl1,Hi minatureone good question! I made the video more as a way to show that you can still eat extreme amounts of protein as a vegan without the need for animal products but there are differing schools of thought on levels of protein which can be utilised. Some say only g per hour whereas others say that the body holds it and it is very slow digesting so that any amino acids which the body needs to replenish the amino acid pool can be extracted this may explain the satiation too since it is so slow to digest. In Tim Ferris  hour body there is a section explaining that it is a myth that we can only utilise a limited amount of protein and also in Brad Pilons book How Much Protein he discusses how those who do the Warrior Diet where they eat only one huge meal each day can still absorb and utilise enough protein even though it only comes from one meal. I would hazard a guess that g is going to be hugely surplus to requirements but I wanted to make the video for fun to show just how much vegan protein can be crammed into one meal. ,veganfitness,d3qiood,11,t5_2smq8

There are medications such as acyclovir that will help you with that.  Occasional outbreaks happen when a person has herpes but it shouldnt be constant for  months.Regular stomach flu could be anything from repeated food poisoning to irritable bowel IBS.   If you feel super stressed that does tend to bring in IBS symtoms.    Stomach pain during and after workouts could be heartburn.

I also like supersetting weight exercises which is HIIT in a way as well. for example in my back and shoulders day I do  exercises right after the other and do  sets of that superset then I have another  exercises superset  times then another  exercise superset  times.Exercises   focus on strength for most muscle groups and size for one or two muscle groups. For instance I focus on strength for legs back and shoulders and I focus on size for my chest. For strength its  reps for bigger muscle groups and  reps for smaller muscle groups think traps rear delts lower back. For size I do  sets per exercise hitting the  rep for  sets  reps for  sets and  reps for  setsExercises   I mix in my running and weight lifting on the same days.

A standard omnivore diet takes in little bits of b throughout the day so  DV is about right but vegans usually take a supplement once a day or every few days. To get the fully required absorption amount a large quantity is needed and those amounts are not anywhere near toxic levels.I hope that helps!

8811005,0,t3_50tk9w,I completely understand your problem and can absolutely relate to it. While Ive learned to muster up some willpower in the process  and you will need that if you want to stick to a healthy diet with and a sustainable calorie count  there are certain things you can do to keep yourself in check in the beginning. The keyword for me is structure. Structure out your whole day and what you eat. You dont need to be crazy about counting calories but it definitely works best if you log what you eat before you eat it  that way you always have a map. MyFitnessPal is a great app for that. Nevermind the calories in the beginning although it does help for  good estimates on what you should and shouldnt consume. Just try to add every night what youre going to eat the next day. Then prepare as much and as best as you can what you want to eat. My laziness often beats my hunger which is why I can stick to a routine that is laid out for me. The good thing is you dont have to count out anything particularly out of your diet but if you really want to lose weight then you have to plan according to your TDEE and go CICO Calories In Calories Out. For example my day looks pretty much like this Breakfast Lots and lots of black coffee. It keeps me awake and concentrated and pushes my hunger feeling away so I can eat breakfast later. Basically I try to do an Intermitted Fasting approach because Im rarely hungry as soon as I wake up. Then around am  slices of proteinbread or whole wheat bread with peanut butter and jelly or with avocado and figs. Snack  Banana Lunch Around pm either a Banh Mih sandwich with tofu so basically bread some greens tofu or an easy couscous salad with olives and chickpeas some olive oil lots of spices. I drink diet coke sometimes or club soda with it. Snack  Munch on carrots tomatoes or have a green smoothie depending on where I am and what Im doing but if its a workday then usually just a little prepared snack that I can chew away on usually some more coffee. Dinner Relatively flexible but I try to always have  protein  carbs and  greens on my plate so  of my plate is tofu or whatnot  is baked sweet potatoe and  is spinach or chard with lemon. The tofu can be fried with a spicy peanut butter sauce peanut butter sriracha soy sauce just go easy on the peanut butter. Whenever you fry something go easy on the oil. Use some dont go crazy.If Im at the gym thats  hours where Im not thinking about food. Afterwards I always treat myself to a nice protein smoothie. Might make up the calories Ive lost but at least Im not eating a donut and its still delicious and keeps me somewhat full. Obviously there are many dinner recipes that you can use but keep it simple! Do something that you like that is healthy and is easy to do. ProTips Dont buy sweets and stuff. Make it hard for you to get to unhealthy stuff. Dont stuff your cabinets with that. And forget about nuts too if you overeat which I do so I never have nuts or dried fruits in my home lest I want to eat it all up in one sitting. That doesnt mean you cant have a sweet snack. I save myself something prepackaged and small for after dinner vegan chocolate or vegan gummi bears usually come in small size packs here and they are so expensive that I dont go crazy on them anyway haha Another tip is to drink lots and lots of water yup I know everybody says that get yourself a lot of chewing gum because sometimes we eat just because we have a bad taste in our mouth or something.. also my experience brush your teeth the  minutes after brushing kind of ruin food for me and again be prepared! Log what youre going to eat! Stick to the plan. Its YOUR plan after all. You also dont need a lot of willpower for that because its easy to follow if you make it easy. Plus it saves a lot of time.  Cut out the alcohol yes that means cutting out a lot of social stuff sometimes too but dont worry about that  as soon as you hit your goal weight you can go back to that because by then you will have hopefully learned to live a structured life full of discipline  Edit to add Understand whether youre a volume eater or a constant eater. Usually those are two different things. For me I realized I like to eat all the time. So I pack according to that.. lots of tomatoes or cucumber to snack on with some salt. I can literally eat so much tomato and cucumber all day and it keeps me happy because Im always always eating something. But there are also phases where I just want to eat  times a day and feel really really full. In that case I leave out the snacks but have relatively huge meals like a whole sweat potato instead of half and a whole head of broccoli and a whole batch of tofu for one dinner. Keeps me good for many many hours and even through breakfast time. It just all depends on how you feel as a person and what your habits currently are.All of that kind of requires you to have some kind of structure though. In fact if you dont have a structured job or schedule your food and gym routine can become your structure. In my experience this has helped me tremendeously with the rest of my life too!On a side note Dont go to the gym to lose weight go to gain strength. If youre sweating your ass off on cardio try mixing it with weight training sometimes. Its the same thing. Choose a routine and stick to it! That way you will create a better system for your body to actually efficiently lose weight and keep it off in the longterm. Plus youll just look better Hope it helps!!,veganfitness,d76yoik,2,t5_2smq8

9795865,0,t1_dakjviq,gt Youre thinking way too far out.  You have to start somewhere.gt If youre going Vegan that in and of itself doesnt necessarily equal healthy.  It could also just be to avoid animal products but you can eat really shitty food and still be Vegan I can make a ton of Southern Italian foods that are perfectly vegan but calorie bombs thanks to Olive Oil and other dego delicacies.  But if you stick to plantbased whole foods which inherently are vegan you avoid premade or manufactured foods.  Its significantly harder to get the same amount of caloric intake from a bowl of broccoli or a bag of apples comparative to a tube of Pringles yet both are vegan I think...dont quote me on the ingredient list of pringles!gt But if you eat right and just do basic exercise...hell even no exercise with the right diet habits...and the weight should just start going away.gt Once youre down to a healthy weight based on your height and gender then you can start being a bit pickier with how you train.  For example.  I play hockey.  My thighs and hipular area are significantly larger than necessary for regular life which makes buying jeans a pain in the ass.  But you dont have to play hockey to have the same setup...you can just do squats.  Weighted squats with a barbell or dumbbells regular bodyweight squats and especially pistols single legged flamingo style looking squats good luck with THAT shit.  That would pack on mass around the hip area like youre looking as well as give you a more rounded muscular ass.  gt Planks as well as compound muscle exercises also have the side effect of giving you abs you cant just get abs you get them primarily from diet but core exercises will strengthen and tone your midsection.  So youll be able to get the body type youre seeking simply by being healthy.  Squats deadlifts and pretty much any bodyweight exercise are the most effective things you can do to get healthy toned and lose weight.  Theyre like magic next to putting the right things on the fork.gt My guess is once you start shedding the weight and you form a habit of simply eating better all the time and not as part of a temporary diet youll sleep better think clearer have more energy be more satisfied with what you see in the mirror and in the end your goals probably will change a bit.  Anyone can say they want to do something complex like walk across the United States.  But I bet by the time they get halfway across their first state they change their goals a bit.gt As for the hair...that one made me laugh.

So some answers No. That depends on the style of workout. When powerlifting ill rarely sweat much at all even when ripping  off the ground. Olympic lifting on the other hand Im basically a water fountain. No. That being said it is likely you will be quite sore during the early months google DOMS. After that itll hit you when you change up your workout but then go away. Instead youll usually have an all over body heaviness but rarely DOMS. As soon as you hit your rep and weight goal with proper form. If youre interested in basic barbell lifting the book Starting Strength is usually your best start. Will go over programming when and how much to lift. Buy body measurement tape and measure yourself once a week at the same time.Also grats on hitting the gym!

10564805,0,t3_5r3qsq,On the days youre not working out if you are eating a wellrounded plantbased diet and an abundance of assorted vegetables grains etc. the protein powder is actually unnecessary. Heres a rough estimate of the amount of protein you should be gettinglbs your weight  .kgs .g protein x .kgs your weight  g of proteinThere are  grams of protein in one cup of beans so if you had beans for every meal that alone would get you to almost your base of protein needs.On days where you are working out the recommended amount for the endurance athlete isroughly .g protein x .kgs your weight   grams of proteinOn these days protein supplementation would be more necessary. So what happens if you have extra protein on the days youre not working out? If your body has no use for the additional protein you actually just end up peeing it out which can lead to dehydration. If you want to keep adding a scoop to your smoothies its not going to be insanely harmful  the harm comes in when you are having WAY more than necessary.
