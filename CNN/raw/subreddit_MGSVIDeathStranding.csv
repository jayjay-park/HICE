7970820,0,t1_d4bxnyi,The stuff from the beginning is a trailer the made for a game show in  before the PT demo was released. Yes I do believe I have heard that the bosses real name is Lisa and I am pretty sure I didnt here it from FIB. I am going to copy paste what i think from another post I made.At  The Bloody hand prints chasing you down the hall as you run away. prints all along the walls.  Hand prints all over Reedus and the sand.The feetus  the baby hes Holding later.Chico ties in MGSI think this is snakes nightmare. I am just not sure which snake. Big Boss or Solid. I am leaning more towards Solid. It wouldnt make sense to have Keefer and Norman both play Big Boss unless this is a flashback or what he sees in his coma. I was thinking this could be a nightmare mission we are seeing and eventually PT would be part of this chapter or game. I think the demo from the first clip is a non playable cut scene to give the players context. Then they play the actual PT part of the missionlevel. Then you see the video from death stranding once you solve the puzzle. Then at some point after the death stranding cut scene reedus wakes up.Either as solid snake. Or as big boss. If reedus was a young big boss i would guess a MGS prequel but I really think we are seeing solid snake right before Metal Gear.I think it makes sense for them to release PT this way. We all know there is a very high demand for more PT. Xbox owners and PC owners never got a taste. PSs with PT on them are still going for over  on ebay. I am sure Kojima knows this. I am sure the demand for more PT and more MGS was obvious to Kojima and to Konami. So why leave them both unfinished? No money in the budget? To make only apps and pachinko machines? I am sure the demand shown for both PT and MGSV would prove kojima correct on the demand for more from the fans and that would give him clearance from konami for the ruse. If this were all connected everyone would want this game. It would have both more MGS and a copy of PT for everyone nightmare level ,MGSVIDeathStranding,d4bzuly,2,t5_3f1xr
