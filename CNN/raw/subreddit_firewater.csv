Cold crashing is used in winebeercider making to help the yeast to settle out and clarify the product and it doesnt go below freezing.I think youre talking about freeze distilling which involves freezing the mash and then removing the ice to concentrate the alcohol.

442329,0,t1_cfn86ag,Just to clarify your point. Ethanol vapor in a still is not potentially explosive due to the lack of oxygen. The explosive potential of a still comes from pressure buildup. However vapor escaping from a still is very explosive. It is always a good idea to make sure your still house is well ventilated that you check for leaks at the beginning of each run and if possible keep all sources of ignition away from your still. Code says everything within  ft should be explosion proof or intrinsically safe though obviously this isnt practical at home. The big boys actually use sensors that can detect vapor clouds moving through their facilities again not practical but still cool.,firewater,cfqm1qt,1,t5_2rcpo

3878382,0,t3_34rje9,Those are oils and what not that you start to collect at a much higher volume the further into your tails low ABV distillate near the end of your run.  Basically it means you tried to collect too much spirits and the longer you go the more fossils and oils you will get in your final product. The easy fix is to dilute it down to  ABV alcohol by volume and then run it again.  This time collect down to maybe  ABV or based off flavor smell etc for your drinking spirits and then collect down to around  ABV which you save for your next run. Generally youll get a better product doing initial stripping runs where you run down to a low ABV.  You do this enough times to fill your still and then combine all the runs and doing a second final run.  This run you do slow and do cuts so you get a great quality product.  You only collect the hearts good stuff and save the tails and heads to use in your next runs. It takes longer to get a final product as you need to do several runs but it is overall faster cheaper and you get a much better overall product. ,firewater,cqydauq,1,t5_2rcpo

A standard brewing grain like row barley malt should never cost more than around  a pound from a shop or online supplier probably a lot less if you buy by the sack. Malted grain is necessary because the malting process causes the grain to develop enzymes that are needed to convert the starch into sugar. It is possible to incorporate some unmalted grain Irish whisky does this for example but you need a certain amount of malt in there or the mashing process which converts starch to sugar wont work.Barley is the grain most commonly used in brewing and distilling but you can absolutely use other types of malt much of the difference between different types of whiskywhiskey comes from using different grain.

Anyway if you have some kind of app or software for calculating beer recipes it should have stats for sugar in it somewhere as well not just malt. What youre planning to do is like brewing but without the mashing so adding sugar is principally the same as if youd used malt extract and the quantities are very similar.Pure sucrose contains  ppg points per pound per gallon of fermentables. Source In English this means that if you add  pound of pure sucrose to  gallon of water youll end up with a specific gravity of . also called  brewers points. In practice the sugar you buy at the grocery store isnt  pure sucrose my brewing software tells me that both cane sugar and corn sugar usually come at about  ppg. Most dry malt extracts the light ones at least for making pilsner and pale ale come at around  ppg so its basically exchangable. Just look up any of the recipes youve used for making beer and substitute sugar if you specifically want a sugar wash instead of a beer.,firewater,d286xau,2,t5_2rcpo

7437865,0,t1_d2nl2b9,The most expensive parts of a complete kit are the stainless keg and the  copper pipe. So to stay at a reasonable price range you need to get creative in sourcing those components. Kegs can be had second hand all over the place but if you have a lot of home brewers around you the prices will be higher. Talk to a local brewery flea market liquor store etc. and try to get an old one for cheap or maybe even free.The pipe can be found at scrap yards if yours will sell to the public. Ive always found huge bins of brand new copper that is left over from construction jobs. They sell it by the pound and it will be vastly cheaper than from a hardware store or online.Next up would be the welding on the keg and this is also highly variable.

7442577,0,t1_d2o4bib,As I mentioned above its more of an issue when you have a boiler charge and a retort fill that are of very similar volatilities as in when you are running wash in your boiler and wash in your retort and you end up condensing much of your boiler vapor into your retort filling it up with much more than your  inch of surface water. To be fair if you are running wash you are extremely unlikely to have an ignition of the charge liquid and vapors when the top pops and there is a volcano of wash and alcohol vapors that interacts with your burner or electronics. However if you are doing a spirit run you are almost guaranteed to have an explosion if you pop the top and have an uncontrolled vapor hot spirit release. Im not saying it will cause an explosion inside your boiler but rather it can cause pressure spikes that can pop any of your connections especially if they are pressfit like on a hoga or alambiq type copper still. The connection can pop anywhere behind the thumper connection however. Thats why I tend to use copper pipe unions the screw type so that is less of a worry. As I just said though DONT fill a thumper with water because it boils at a higher temperature than alcohol so your alcohol vapor at C will just condense in your thumper until the proof of the condensed liquid in your thumper reaches the point where it can be boiled by the residual heat coming through the vapor path from the boiler. Make sense? By that time you may have added so much volume of condensed vapors that its no longer  of retort charge liquid but more like  or  or  depending on the height of your retort. the more full the more pressure builds to bubble the vapors through and hence the more pressure building up in the boiler. The pressure can spike and eject the onion or swan neck or any part of the vapor path if its not securely connected or has a PRV pressure release valve that is properly sized to the appropriate PSI to relieve the backpressure without popping a connection and causing an uncontrolled vapor leak condition.If all your connections are very secure but you dont have a PRV a soldered connection rivet or weld could fail somewhere if it wasnt done well causing a pressurized leak of hot spirit and vapor. If you end up with a supersoakerlike jet of hot spirit and vapor jetting into your element electronics or your direct flame burner then you end up with a KaBoom. This is exactly what happened at the Silver Trail Distillery killing their distiller recently. While he wasnt using a retortthumper he stupidly overpacked his column with glass marbles causing a very similar pressure spike condition which led to the pressurized leak and subsequent explosion when it hit his direct fire burner. ,firewater,d2o69j2,1,t5_2rcpo

9577569,0,t1_d9tf42u,You need to get over fears. While distillation and making beer seem like the same thing  the hazards are very different. When making beer for example sterilization is paramount. When fermenting for distillation it isnt. Yes you want things clean but it doesnt really matter if a short ferment gets infected. Theres nothing thats going to outcompete your yeast nothing thats going to survive the boiler and nothing  thats going to take hold in the distillate. Strong alcohol is itself a sanitizer. On the other hand materials are a concern. Many synthetics that are perfectly fine with beer and wine are unusable with strong alcohol due to its properties as a solvent. In general you dont want anything between the boiler and spout except copper andor stainless and dont want to collect in anything but glass or age in anything but glass andor wood. PTFE is one of a very very few synthetics that has any place in the process. ,firewater,d9tmpvt,1,t5_2rcpo

11688795,0,t3_66qdql,Everyone is on point here.The side bar design is just a good target size as its practical not too huge and not too tiny. The riser can be any length if kept reasonable. Dont go  long obviously. The amount of passive reflux that occurs will be minimal compared to other factors.What I would do is add to this design put an additional  elbow and a union between them. So the first  turns horizontal then a union then the other  on the liebig. This will allow you to adjust the height of the output to whatever you want anything below horizontal.If you use triclamps on the different sections you can use the riser pipe as part of a reflux still later on as well.
