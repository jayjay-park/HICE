If Im correct SDCC has a big focus on Game Of Thrones for similar reasons. Both shows have large fan bases but there is some advertising behind it all.

7152544,0,t1_d1qwjb2,The panels are MUCH improved if they do it like they did last year.You get in line a little bit before doors to the venue open but not necessarily as early as years before and you get into a queue hall inside the venue before the show itself opens.  I believe this year they let people into the queue hall around AM.   There is a LOT of space in the queue hall so if you show up maybe an hour before theres no worry about any panels or at least there wasnt this year.   Once the line fills up or mostly fills up theyll wristband people and then you can go try to get in the back of another line to get into another panel of the same day.    A friend got into the Firefly and XFiles panels this way.  Then you need to probably show up an hour or more ahead of the actual panel as they will do the same thing for each panel beforehand.  Its not bad!  Definitely nothing like having to sit in line for hrs just to get in to some of them.  ,NYCC,d1r68dy,2,t5_2v1q5

Seeing as this second round of tickets are the ones that got refunded from people not linking fan verification profiles mostly I doubt that anyone who went thru all the effect to get a day or day pass would give them up.

8809423,0,t3_50sl4l,Panels are basically a giant QampA session. Panelists sit on the stage and there is usually a moderator who asks the panelists questions before opening it up to limited audience QampA where people can line up behind a mic stand and ask whatever they want within reason. If the panel is for a movie or a tv show there is generally some sort of video clips of upcoming episodes previously unreleased trailers etc.. Sometimes they show an entire episode.During the panel you can definitely not meet them or get autographs. Panels are only about an hour and they would never get through anything if they let people get autographs not to mention that some of the guests may be charging for autographs in the autograph area. Dont use the QampA to ask for an autograph either because you wont get it and youll make people angry. Sometimes you can approach the panelists after the panel but it depends on the panel. Scheduling is tight and they need to clear out and let the next panel set up.You should be able to take photos or video of the panel EXCEPT during any video presentations. Marvel especially will shut you down if you even have your phone out when there is something on the screen. If youre not allowed to record theyll let you know but every panel that Ive been to has had no problem with it except as I said during the exclusive reveals.,NYCC,d76rtjl,4,t5_2v1q5

The focus is all in lining up whether thats for exclusives or simply entry into the venue so you have a chance to wait in another line. Sure the merch was cool. The crowd is a spectacle to see in itself too. But theres nothing I want that much. And panels for the most part dont mean enough to me to wait hours on end.
