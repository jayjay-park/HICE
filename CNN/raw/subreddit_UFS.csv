2528675,0,t1_cmojtuu,Exactly the way you could do it i suppose would be to use dividends i think thats right Meaning every cargo run you do or every ship you escort there is a set rate meaning that UFC gets the cash and then pays the emplyees the simple fact is that UFS will not be able to pay anyone till its gathers enough cash to stock multiple factorys then when the influx of cash is greater than what we need to fund the corp we can start handing out dividends everymonth the exes cash is given out in percentages  for Ceos  for Managers and the rest divided up for all members if we manage to have a flow of cash where the managers and pilots alike do not just use the UFS brand name and take all the creditsyou point about working for UFS v Freelancing is rediculously important the way we could work around this is ensuring that we use our security force to the highest level meaning not nesacerly creating an army but a force that will be able to make our fuel transporters never doubt there security we could change the tax system and take  of every fuel run. lets just cross our fingers that CR is going to be able to ensure maximum corporation control ,UFS,cmomu1c,1,t5_2xolz
