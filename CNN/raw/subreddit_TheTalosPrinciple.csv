4647469,0,t1_cstyq81,Wow haha I think I found like maybe  paint buckets in the entire game.,TheTalosPrinciple,ctgdl5j,2,t5_324h1
4700767,0,t1_ctltl8y,I liked the ascension of the Gehenna people. It felt powerful especially with the chanting in the background.I feel that the expansion was pretty solid but it lacked the mystery and suspense of the main game if you know what I mean.I remember when I was first playing the main game I was dying to find out what secret Elohim is hiding from me in that dark and scary tower. He seemed like a nice guy and I wanted to listen to him but the curiosity was too much.In Gehenna I didnt really have to think much. I was given a single linear path to follow and all I had to do was follow it. ,TheTalosPrinciple,ctn2jp3,3,t5_324h1
4717440,0,t3_3ff7fs,I read that as the child programs being the ones that defied Elohim or werent good enough to solve the puzzles. So the independence check passed for them but they didnt finish it on their own so the logic failed. So its not your logic performance that failed its theirs.,TheTalosPrinciple,ctp670i,3,t5_324h1

8508354,0,t1_d64h8hh,This was actually what I did for my Skyrim series that I just finished where episodes varied from the shortest of about  minutes to the longest around  minutes. The problem there was that I recorded about  hour sessions which was then split up into  parts during editing and because of this there wasnt a Hellogoodbye for every video which is something most people like pIve actually already recorded  hour of gameplay of The Talos Principle where I tried to hit  minutes for each recording with the hellogoodbye for each but now that Im about to edit them  I started doubting that timeframe for this particular game xDEDIT Forgot to add that I think Ill cut two of the recorded episodes together into  with the magic of video editing P ,TheTalosPrinciple,d653ln0,1,t5_324h1
8518242,0,t3_4wdu1j,The moment around the middle of World A when the world suddenly went black and shook until Elohim yelled at it to fix it scared the HELL out of me. Ever since then Ive been afraid of dark places in that game. Another thing that scared me was when I was randomly walking around an area in World C and fell through the road  I was walking on into that little glitch in the matrix. I was terrified of that place.,TheTalosPrinciple,d66c9z5,8,t5_324h1
8920218,0,t1_d7k2hqq,No A is where you start. The tower is technically a th area.Im not sure what you mean by The temple as its been a while since Ive played the game. But if you havent progressed past area A its safe to say the puzzles do get a lot harder. Youve unlocked the connector and the box but theres at least  more puzzle elements that are introduced in the later levels and youll not only have to learn them but learn to combine them with the elements youve already learned.Besides collecting tetris pieces there are also stars to collect in each level and they are much harder to find. Keep your eyes out for those.,TheTalosPrinciple,d7k2vow,6,t5_324h1
