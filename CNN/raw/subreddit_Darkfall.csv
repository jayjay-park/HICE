4048583,0,t1_crhrern,To say it didnt die to the game and to say it didnt die to the developers not fixing the game is the same thing. The game wasnt good enough. The game wasnt where it needed to be and UW was an attempt to soften the game and bring in a new audience while still maintaining the DF core audience and it didnt work. DayZ is not a valid comparison as it is an FPS and you dont lose some shit you spent months acquiring you move from server to server you can hop in and hop out you dont level etc. etc. You dont deal with any long term consequences. Rust is not even finished. Nor is Reign of Kings. UO has a small core of players from the hayday of UO but if UO was released today there wouldnt be anyone playing it. Also UO has TONS of content compared to Darkfall an incredibly complex socialpvp system housing and looting and pickpocketing etc. etc. My point is that Darkfall really has nothing. The only thing Darkfall has is a PvP system. Thats it! Darkfall brings hardly anything new to the table and neglects everything an MMO requires to be an MMO. The reason people play Darkfall is there is literally no other modern MMO that could give you good combat full loot pvp. Its the only one and its immensely flawed. If a new game was released that was everything Darkfall should be this sub and DFs hopes and dreams would die overnight. Darkfall is the hottest ugly chick in the town. Nobody really wants to fuck her but theres no other alternatives. Shes not hot shes not fun to be around but she gives a really great blowjob.

4113206,0,t1_crp27hw,I do not mean to be condescending but you are being ridiculous. Games have had combat systems that scale up and down forever now yet you would remove one of the selling point and successes of DFO just because you dont know how to balance things?Its not a question of catering to small scale players but making sure all situations in the game are enjoyable. There will always be players able to win against the odds whether it be numbers or gimped builds but the average player is what matters.Whether it is  or M people agreeing on something doesnt add or remove truth to it. Skill slot or skill cap systems work similarly by making each character able to only deal with one or two situation. It works for group content of a set size but it doesnt scale up or down. It either adds to much impact when the groups are too small or is not noticeable  too powerful in larger scale.The beauty of DFO was that every character could deal with most situations. Be it damage support tanking healing escapes etc. id just required a lot of work to achieve which added to the power gap. Ideally a revival of the game should aim at the same end result but offer more choices and alternatives that require less work. For instance giving non magic characters utility abilities. an instant ray could be a crosbow bolt aoes with battlespikes heals with bandages Those tools serve the same purpose but in different ways.Once you have a baseline where each playstyle has access to a version of each tool you add force multipliers that encourage specialization. Create drawbacks for each choice of additional abilities mutually exclusive bonuses and so on. Make sure that specialists are clearly superior at one role at the expense of others. Less work for more raw power but being limited to a subset of possible roles.,Darkfall,crp4q2y,1,t5_2qzn6

Its not free money. Even if DFUWs revenue is insignificant these days it will be affected. Also if AV is smart theyll need to perform due diligence on the folks looking to license DF.

7789425,0,t1_d3rknqk,Darkfall is nothing right now  so keep your biased opinion to yourself  or lay it down completely in a text.Im just tired of all you veterans throwing hissy fits as soon as someone brings up a valid change that you dont agree with.  you agree with nothing unless its status quo Its really hilarous to see you guys whine for months but none of you cant even understand the bigger picture  the system as a whole.Short version  You dont make me sick  you make me feel pity for you  for being so pathetic. Keep jerking off your own shitty pvp videos  you must have accumulated a lot over the years so youll be good for a while.,Darkfall,d3rl6ct,5,t5_2qzn6
7793723,0,t1_d3rnh4n,BTW when i said that my leader deals with these gold farmers i dont mean to say that he pay real money. I meant that he gives them a shelter and he buys stuff from them at a lower price.that was a common practice in DFO.Give a shelter to a gold farmer and pay for cheap stuff from them with gold not real money.So while gold selling should always be illegal helping a gold farmer in game by protecting him and stuff should not be illegal. Its a sandbox game we do what ever the fuck we want in game if were not cheating.,Darkfall,d3s2mlu,1,t5_2qzn6
7877616,0,t1_d418njj,Yup i completely agree with the intentions behind your thoughts. What im saying is that i dont see how cloths like a blue sash over your veilron chest will change anything to the scenarios you describe here.You still have  other piece of armor on you that are not hidden. Obviously when i mention a clothing system  i dont imagine people wearing KKK robes that dissimulate their whole body with their weapons included. There is obviously a balance to be found here between What is shown  what is hidden  vs a consequences for using such a tactic like a stat penalty.  less fire resistance  weight penalty  possibility for the cloths to burst in flame if fire is used on you  there are many solutions to be used here again.   Cloths could be wearable only on certain kinds of armors or body parts  if you have enough artists for it you can go the hard way and modelise the overarmor cloths to mould the armor form to let people recognize them that way. the solutions i offer are always while keeping in mind a minimum development cost  dyes and cloths seems really minimal to add in the way i would do them. ,Darkfall,d41im1p,2,t5_2qzn6

8114121,0,t3_4qct1u,There are a few known issues including one that causes periodic crashes for some users and some login in issues. Weve done a hotfix for a few bugs already and plan for another one Friday. Servers have held on very well. No crashes and no issues on that front. Same for downloads. Were pretty happy about that. Our efforts up until now were not in vain.There is no such thing as a perfect launch but this one went better than expected. ,Darkfall,d4s3mvc,8,t5_2qzn6

8436422,0,t3_4v5y5o,I bought into both endeavours to support the game I love. Ideally both will pan out and we will have two very different worlds. Only time will tell but Ive got my fingers crossed. Not so much because I paid a few dollars but because DF is magic to me.,Darkfall,d5w3bzf,6,t5_2qzn6
8481334,1,t1_d61gy8m,Archer melee pointless??? Did we play the same game? Destroyers were game changers in group fights. A lot of people say they arent that good but most of them really didnt know how to play that role. To say that they wereare pointless is a joke. ,Darkfall,d61pleq,2,t5_2qzn6
8633989,0,t1_d6juhh9,Totally agree. Perhaps local banking could be added in parallel with global banking. For example if one puts his items in a localized bank instead of a global one the items durability is restored over time if the right ingredients are also placed alongside the items.Just like in real life there have to be trade offs and benefits as motives.,Darkfall,d6kutld,1,t5_2qzn6

9227503,0,t1_d8lkjtb,Id be shocked if it wasnt the case since DFUW was built on the DF code. The reason I mentioned that Aventurine did it wasnt to say oh wow they did so good it was to highlight that it was NOT an issue with the engine itself in DFUW as a lot of people kept predicting. And also to highlight that DFUW with DF movementmeleeaccuracy was a reality for a brief moment because a lot of people quit long before seeing such changes or arent aware of anything that got changed postlaunch.Just simple unbiased facts. Aventurine should have made those changes years ago but we got a pretty good idea now as to how they operated. You wont hear me praise Aventurine as a company but some individuals such as yourself did manage to get things done  its just unfortunate that management wasnt part of that.TLDR A DFUW with DF responsiveness was a brief reality.,Darkfall,d8lnjk8,1,t5_2qzn6
9336342,0,t1_d8zd320,Completely agree no need to limit but build incentive for those who want to be specialized to specialize. Rather than be punished for trying to not follow the cookie cutter recipe. ,Darkfall,d8zg721,1,t5_2qzn6
