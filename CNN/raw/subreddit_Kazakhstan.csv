2194439,0,t3_2k6mpn,Hi!     Baykonur is not a tourist attraction.  This link here lists some of the restricted areas in Kazakhstan and Baykonur is one of them.       Even Kazakhstan citizens cannot get to there.    You can get to there if you know someone who can directly request your visit and even that is not easy because of all political circumstances.    I heard a story from some Kazakh friends that they met some Australian guys searching for a spot to watch the rocket launch from afar. I dont know if theyve succeeded.But I want to warn you when wandering in that area you might attract some unwanted attention and theres no guarantee you would meet only friendly people.And lastly although there is a chance to see something worthy there I think it will most likely be quite dull.  It would probably be much easier much more fun for you to visit Cape Canaveral to be honest.,Kazakhstan,clirmjw,3,t5_2rvej

3711628,0,t1_cqe6ecl,No I understood its just that a lot of people that I know here get offended when I call them Asian since they refer to themselves as European though theyre really not... When I refer to Asian things they automatically think Im talking about Korean Chinese stuff so I guess I just got into that mindset! ,Kazakhstan,cqfcn5i,1,t5_2rvej

4929468,0,t1_cufp8uj,Yes he shouldnt need a visa if he is staying for less than  days I believe it was. Theyll just give you a tiny paper to fill out and you need to give that back to immigration when you leave the country so hold on to it!!Can he really get by with English? Astana perhaps but living in Almaty for over  years Ive always had a very very difficult time on my own with only English. I mean its fine if hes just going to Esentai mall but if hes traveling... He DEFINITELY need to know some Russian especially the signs and menus are usually in both Russian and Kazakh. Plus hell be catching the train and bus.Luckily for you tenge has dropped significantly but Almaty is still a pretty expensive city. Im not too sure about Astana because Ive only been there once. ,Kazakhstan,cufwd96,1,t5_2rvej

6662437,0,t3_462s2z,I am no cook but THE dish over here is BeshBarmaq turkic words for five fingers. its big pieces of meat preferably horse on bones boiled for about three hours with thin slices of dough added at the end. in different places we also add potatoes onion carrots and other veggies. Thats pretty much it and other turkic peoples have similar dishes of the same name. Now some people in the south would claim that kursh is bigger than beshbarmaq but theyre filthy infidels dont listen.,Kazakhstan,d08gboo,1,t5_2rvej

10537424,0,t1_dd2bk9i,Uzbeks were originally the nomads that came with Shaybanids and took over mawaranahr iirc. The local turkic and iranian populations were called sart. Later they were all given the name of uzbeks but the majority state language was chosen of sarts karlukchagataietc.Karakalpaks are a separate ethnicity that is sometimes called karakapapakhs. kalpak and papakh both mean headgear.Theres not too many real nomads left not enough to have any sort of influence. Most of them live in the clay houses with some amenities pretty much all year and some family members do take their cattle mal to zhailau yaylaq.Dont really have any statistics about the history education but its usually the more educatedupper middle class people in general. Poor people dont have access to better schooling and dont put as much emphasis on education for certain reasons. These young less educated people tend to fall towards islamisation to fill the void so to say.Edit want to add that the karluk turks in mawaranahr before the shaybanids were mostly sedentary hence why I said nomadic uzbeks,Kazakhstan,dd2j7ve,1,t5_2rvej
