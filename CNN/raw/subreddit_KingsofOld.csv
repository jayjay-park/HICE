4277992,0,t1_cs7petg,A man sits next to you as he begins to. He wears formal grab for this feast a expertly crafted leather coat with a padded jerkin over top. His boots polished and his callused flesh cleaned for the event. His silver hair swept back and his sapphire eyes shimmering in the light of the feasts glory he was surely a Lord. He filled up his wine glass and began to scan the feast kinda of a tunnel vision since he was looking for some meat to tear between his teen and devour. He notices you when he sees the boar on your plate.Excuse me. Might I ask where you got that meat?,KingsofOld,cs7uk4n,1,t5_38esr
4280888,0,t1_cs86700,Lyssa chuckled and sat next to him getting comfortable on the chair and taking some wine. Forgive me for startling you and thank you for the seat and wine my lord. And no your sister has not come in fact she is to be sent back to her your home. She didnt continue on that subject she quickly switched to explaining how she had arrived. By carriage of course but that is obvious his grace asked me to accompany him here. Lyssa sipped on the wine then smiled at him. She looked at the wine in her cup curiously. Forgive me but Im not all familiar with wines but which one is this? She raised her goblet only a little.,KingsofOld,cs86b9s,1,t5_38esr
4335898,0,t1_csdkkii,Rhaenys looked to her the small councilman for the longest of silent times before finally speaking. She was shocked to hear such things. It was odd to hear she was loved. The Queen didnt often hear such things and for her paramour to say them it astounded her even more.How long...? she asked quietly. By now the anger had simply melted away after the words were spoken. Rhaenys sat on the bed covered with silks and pillows astounded and curious. Mostly she was confused as to how Daegon could love her. While it was what she wanted it also meant the unknown. It would break tradition within her family. She had three brothers that she could choose from but marrying one of them wasnt something she wanted.You must still be drunk. No one in their right mind would say something so....rash.,KingsofOld,csedvov,2,t5_38esr
4438067,0,t1_csq36xt,Tommen Lannister appeared amused by the Lady of Crows Nest sudden gleeful outburst but made no comment upon it. Instead his eyes traced the movements of her talon clad finger as it gradually slithered across the Stormlands and stopped on the fortress of Storms End. The seat of House Durrandon. Your Queen has made some.. errors. Incurred the wrath of the Gardeners a Kingdom far more powerful than even the Stormlords. I would suggest preparing your keep for potential assault in the coming months. ,KingsofOld,csq3qa1,1,t5_38esr
4445273,0,t1_csprgal,Round ? Results amp ReactionsCorrick Dayne   vs Dareon  Fatigue  AdvantageMomentum along with distance that was what he was taught to utilise. If the point is brought away use that momentum to carry the butt toward the mans head. It was easier always easier to follow through with any given motion than to resist it.The drums began to ring in his ears his feet moving to their beat as he danced backwards spinning the spear over his head to catch him off guard with the extra range he had. He hadnt felt this tired in a long time not since that long ride back to Starfall at the Fallen Stars command blood spilling from the arrow that the idiot had pulled from his neck.He tried to push that memory back force it down as he tried once more to lose himself in the moment.Dareon Targaryen   vs Corrick  Fatigue  AdvantageAfter talking with Corrick Daeron was rearing to go.

4483941,0,t1_csvcsu7,Myranda reached out to sip from her juice happily as she sat down in her chair her legs swinging back and forth since she was too short for them to reach the ground. Theobald nodded his own head in thanks as he took the seat beside Myranda glancing down at the goblet of wine with little interest.It was rare for Theobald to drink any wine apart from the fruity concoctions that were becoming so popular in the Reach yet he did not want to appear as if he was distrustful of his hosts. He took the goblet and raised it to his lips sipping from it before setting it down again green eyes flicking over to Olyvar as he was addressed. It was a matter of ease I am afraid much too simple. The Green Knight could barely even keep his lance in the air to aim at me though I do agree that Queen Durrandons reaction made the entire affair...worth it.He glanced over to his daughter and the princess smiling as he reached out a hand to pet Myrandas hair once or twice giving her a pat on the head. I hope you and yours Prince Olyvar enjoyed the affair? I myself cannot be more glad that it is over too long already have I stayed in these dreary walls most fortunately I shall be leaving hastily this evening.Myranda frowned looking up at her father. Am I going?No no Myranda. Lady Hightower and I must make all speed to Oldtown I am afraid her father has fallen ill and she wishes me to pay my respects he is the Lord of the Green Purse after all.,KingsofOld,csvv6vk,2,t5_38esr
4626720,0,t1_csx4pnw,Tommen Lannister King of the Rock. Men said compassion and mercy were as foreign to him as green grass was to a carp  and he would have it no other way. But in the presence of his sister? He did not have to cultivate the image of a unassailable King nor did he have to be cautious against the possibility of her being a treacherous snake as most nobles of Westeros ultimately boiled down to. As Tommen embraced his sister he showed a emotion that one could be convinced by his outward behavior as to completely lack Vulnerability. There was nothing said nothing needing to be said. Merely a hefty sigh passed into the golden haired kings shoulder as the siblings disentangled from one another. Parts of it of course. I have some plans with certain individuals hawking or talking or the like The King of the Rock seated himself embracing the comfort of wine and the tender velvet lining of the ash carved seat. I know you probably dont want to talk about it now after tonight but Id like to take acquire some coin  Reach or Stormlands or whichever place we care for least  and take retribution on that monster Manderly. I know the scheming and strategizing isnt usually my place but... what he did was an affront! I have a plan brother but I want your take before I put it in motion and remove this burden from my shoulders.Tommen smiled. She wasnt like the others. Not a mewling quim nor some slack prize to be won and expected to quietly sew ones banners and give suck to ones children like a good little wife. She was cunning powerful and suffered no dishonor. Her beauty was but one facet of her glittering diamond. It vexed Tommen incredibly when men came swaggering blustering hollow praises expecting for her to blush and become smitten like some lowborn maiden obsessed with the tales of charming princes with naught but a eye for the treasure between her legs and blind to what was inside her skull and heart. It took some restraint not to behead everyone of her suitors with Brightroar. None deserved her. If anything men should be beggaring themselves and paying dowries to even have the slightest of chances to be graced by her. Alas one day she would have to be sold off for some alliance or the other for she could never be her own sovereign ruler. Perhaps the Dornish in that aspect atleast had the right of it?The Manderlys seed is as watery as their namesake. It is a miracle they can procreate nevermind prove any threat to the Rock besides incoherent alcoholfueled japes. Tommen sighed. It is tempting to seek revenge upon the fools  and we will. But the sweetest revenge is when your foes are forced to look upon your power and kneel to you is it not? We will focus on expanding the power of the West and have our retribution through that sweet sister.,KingsofOld,ctdrqh4,1,t5_38esr

Yet you must think quickly else trouble great shall befall you I am afraid. The Eunuch shrugged putting on an unconvincing sorrowful look.,KingsofOld,ctoqpzf,1,t5_38esr
