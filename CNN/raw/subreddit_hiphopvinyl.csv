6536748,0,t1_czun4kt,Great post man!Looking at this thread Im a bit surprised you havent gotten any upvotes or discussion for that breakdown.  Especially since every single time DJ Shadows Endtroducing gets dropped in here which weve all seen a thousand times it blows the fuck up.Im a fan of the man myself.  Everything about this series is HQ handmade quite literally.  When this came out years ago it was originally exclusive to djshadow.com and they released them all hand numbered limited to that number and hand customized to the buyers name and each one came with its own black and white press photo of Shadow.  So I bought every one of the records and decided to frame those press photos   I figured they would sell out quickly when they dropped back in  so I bought them the day I got the DJ Shadow email announcement.  Here I got lucky number Anyways every single one of them is good.  That one you dropped is the only way to get those songs in their dirty versions BTW every other version on wax is clean.Besides that those mixes and his unreleased except on an ass sounding bootleg collab with Zach De la Rocha and a ton of other great material is on those thoughtfully produced records.I even bought the one Handmade CD that wasnt avail on vinyl which is a great mix BTW.  If you know DJ Shadow mixtapes which I know you do you know they are good.,hiphopvinyl,czvgap3,2,t5_31w05

8705658,0,t1_d6tt1gs,Thanks.  About  years ago I met him on an old school message board called OldSchoolHipHop.com and we hit it off nicely.  Hes one of those humble guys who doesnt have anything to prove to anyone anymore so he is very easy to approach.  We started chatting back then online and became friends and exchanged info shortly after.  We chat and trade mixes and records from time to time now.But yeah recently I asked him for the opportunity to interview him and I had to send him some stuff for the interview anyways so I made it a point to sending him these  records for his autograph.  Ive had the records for years theyve always been special to me but now they are even more so.  He signed em at his work and had a coworker snap the photo for me thats how down to earth he is.  Anyways hes a really good man after years of addiction hes cleaned up and very religious now and has a million Facebook friends so if you want to friend him hell friend you back right away hes just that kind of openhearted to everyone person.,hiphopvinyl,d6tub6k,3,t5_31w05
