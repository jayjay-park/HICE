5204803,0,t1_cvdcrw7, good question. I also wanna know if he had anything to do with their track from the Sacred Seeds omnibus mezame. That was a very NIN song and even though they flirted with electronic music a little bit later it was never quite like this stuff. what did you think of Endorphine? I was pretty into them. I actually had their first CD I dont know where it is anymore though,visualkei,cvdde62,1,t5_2sc43
5259164,0,t3_3l4amx,Early Meji just didnt do anything for me but Im really liking all their recent stuff from this year. The only downside is I feel the song could be longer? ,visualkei,cvjx1db,2,t5_2sc43

5926996,0,t3_3g4dc0,ROUAGE  ROUAGE ..This is one of my favorite V albums! Very raw dark and mysterious. This is how Id define ROUAGEs selftitled debut. Except for bass player KAIKI who was a bit older and more experienced than anyone else all the members were around  years old during the recordings and I think SHONO was only  at the time!. And their immaturity shows.Vocalist KAZUSHI seemed shy and his voice control wasnt quite there yet. And RIKA and RAYZI werent as tight as they would become later in ROUAGEs career. But the energy is there and theres enough heart to transform this into a great record.You can tell this was very very influenced by early  Kuroyume and LUNA SEA.  perfectly captured gothic postpunk deathrock hardcore and metal influences and mixed them all together to create an incredible atmosphere that only V can express.So yeah the atmosphere is pretty grim throughout the whole thing. The exception being the classic Cry for the moon which is definetely the brightest point of the album. I love this one to death! I know they rerecorded this a couple of times for  Tsumetai taiyou and ROUAGE  but the original was always my favorite one. Brilliant song!I really like songs that start right off with the chorus like LUNA SEAs WISH which Im pretty sure was used as a template for creating Cry for the moon.One thing that I liked about ROUAGE was that all members contributed to the songwriting process some more some less but pretty much all their records have at least one song by each member.For exemple with the exception of  Shikumaretatoki which was written by Mr. Sasaki aka their first producer head of their label noir and a proeminent figure in the Nagoya scene every members gets a credit.Now lets go back to the beginning of the album because the first half of the ROUAGE is SPOTLESS.  is over two minutes long but its just a long intro with KAZUSHI saying he wished he was dead at the end. The album begins with Function and Ill be damned if this shit isnt intense!KAZUSHI mumbles and grumbles mostly in english! warbles and in the end hes screaming his mind out while SHONO proceeds to beat the crap out of his kit! This was always a huge fan favorite at their concerts! Fan girls all headbanging in unison while standing up. They would later perfect this one after rerecording Function in  as part of their  single. They condensed all aggresion to fit under one minute and the results are glorious!Next up probably my absolute favorite song on the disc and another huge indies classic  Mezame no utage Aaaaaah this is cool...  More aggression! More violence! SHONO again rips his drum kit to pieces. The original version is bloody amazing. Even better live!The aforementioned Cry for the moon slows things down a bit and lays the ground for an absolute gothic masterpiece by KAIKI Mist of Tears Fantastic mysterious and sorrowful atmosphere! RAYZI and RIKA sound brilliant here! I think the only problem is that this one shows how inexperienced KAZUSHI was. Whenever he tries to reach the higher notes in the verses I get a little uncomfortable. Hes almost there but never quite reaches it. Still this is a fantastic song! I just wish we had more than the demo version in which KAZUSHI sounded surprisingle better! and the edited rerecordedremixed version in their last indies single  Risoukyou.I was torn choosing between hide and seek and its infanticide lyrics or the darkness of bass heavy ark But I went with the song that named their fan club because its got a killer atmosphere and I get goosebumps just remembering about the TOUR  FINAL TOUR Risoukyou FINAL version. Fantastic concert opener! Almost no lyrics just the sound of the drums bass and the guitars along with KAZUSHI moaning that its too late for the artistic deceiver. Beautiful beautiful stuff. They would also rerecord this one a couple of times. The rendition on  is amazing and I even dig the remix on emergency express  under the name too late.Finally madness slowly takes over Paranoia creating one of the biggest  classics of all time. ! Only RIKA could have done this. His derranged personality was always my favorite ROUAGE member! Always entertaining live. Speaking of live this one is better experienced live! To get the full Paranoia experience watch the fantastic TOUR  FINAL. Seriously as a V you owe it to yourself. As they did with almost half the album they would rerelease this song as part of their nd major single insomnia. Frankly I think the rerecording is better. I think it captures the live feel a bit more and is way more aggressive.Either way its a fantastic song!ROUAGE is one of my favorite bands of all time and I think this is a great introduction to them because it shows that they werent always THAT melodic and LUNA SEAy. They had an edge especially with KAIKI still with them that was dormant for most of their major releases. I love the major era for all kinds of different reasons they  play better KAZUSHI sings better the arrangements are tighter etc. But its the youthful energy that transforms this into a wonderful record. Get this no matter what.,visualkei,cxwk6lj,3,t5_2sc43
6210748,0,t3_40nlsf,Gaaah I love  so much. MASCHERA is a damn cool band who had a string of minor hits during the late s thanks to the V boom.The star of the band was vocalist MICHI now on S.Q.F. this guy has an incredible voice and control! Strickly talking about vocal talent hes really high in my personal ranking.When MASCHERA recently reunited in  for their th anniversary concert he was pretty much brilliant all night. That guy can SING! Their reunion DVD is all kinds of awesome. Great setlist!Im kinda hoping they will reunite again next year to celebrate their other landmark their th major debut anniversary. All four members MICHI TAKUYA HIRO and TOMO are still friends from what Ive seen and I still have that little bit of hope!This is their th major single when they were still under TEICHIKU RECORDS who quite frankly doesnt have the greatest track record when it comes to rock bands... Well there was money to be made back them with the scene and everybody wanted some. Their first major album iNTERFACE still sounds very good today! I recommend to any fan who likes melodic stuff. I know a lot of hardcore V fans dig that record and I have to say I heard it last month and is still surprisingly strong! kou and  Yurari are wonderful singles!Video taken most probably from their first major video compilation SCOPE FILE ZERO from . I dont think this was ever released on DVD. I would LOVE to own it if TEICHIKU reissued it.,visualkei,cyvlfmf,1,t5_2sc43
6407209,0,t1_czhdkkn,Honestly Its probably not the best indication of their sound overall but it contains all of the things I love the most about Diru wrapped up in a very progressive and tasteful? reveal. The melodic chorus parts and guitar solo are so satisfying in this songs because they are so little of the actual song like th in total. And we get all of the early heavy moments not to mention the entrancing . For me this is what a lot of early Dir en Grey is about sickly riffs and dark verses building up to satisfying melodic releases. I may be influenced heavily by nostalgia as well it was one of the first Diru tunes to really make me go whoa this is amazing. Real talk  If someone I knew wanted me to introduce them to the band I would give them MACABRE or KISOU and tell them to go for a walk with some nice headphones or lay down and just listen to them in one go. The album experience is almost essential imo!For next week MUCC the GazettE or Phantasmagoria all sound good. I like aiming for groups with extensive discographies although I feel like we will all end up choosing old songs ahaha.,visualkei,czhxnpk,1,t5_2sc43
6811459,0,t1_d0odfcl,Ah yes their first major single! Nice! It has that happy vibe that some of Jannes bsides have as well.I have an idea of what BUCKTICK song Id choose but it can all change they have so much stuff!,visualkei,d0odjo8,1,t5_2sc43
6997928,0,t1_d185sac,I forgot it too. . . .and I always got the impression they wouldnt want to reunite without Kami.I was surprised they did anything after.,visualkei,d19k4ce,2,t5_2sc43
7074711,0,t3_4chq7r,Damn  is cool. The problem with  is that hes WAY cooler than all the other guys combined! I mean I know guitarist marya writes  of their stuff so I should give him at least some merit in how everything works and all the wierdness they pulloff but  is just so overthetop and charismatic that it makes hard for me to notice anyone else. I do hope the other guys come out of their shells a bit more in the future. A great part of being a fan of a band is that their personalities should welcome you just as much as their songs. It what can transform you from just a person who digs music to an actual follower.Anyway these guys are awesome. You should listen to them as soon as possible!,visualkei,d1ia5v5,2,t5_2sc43

7689944,0,t1_d3g166k,gt though drummers dont usually influence that too muchExcept for The GazettE or Dir en grey or girugamesh or MERRY ... Drummers influence bands a lot more than you think they do and often are their leaders as in half of the cases that I just listed off the top of my head.,visualkei,d3gapp4,1,t5_2sc43
