3694740,0,t3_32oga7,I would recommend the Nike Free Run .. Really solid shoe for running. I run all the time in them and they are pretty durable. Ive gone running through trails and done jumping jacks burpees so on and so forth and theyve never let me down. Really comfortable and lightweight. Feels like you can take them and throw them a mile away. ,Nike,cqdfb1t,4,t5_2r4sp

7332038,0,t3_4fnvof,Im guessing if fulllength zoom were standard it would make them too similar to KDs.  This gives them more variety in the signature product line.But I totally agree I probably would have bought some Xs or XIs by now if they had fulllength zoom standard.  I dont like them enough to drop  or whatever on IDs just to add the option.,Nike,d2blp8p,1,t5_2r4sp

8032384,0,t3_4p6024,i agree about the pegasus  its cushioning is much more firm and i didnt like mine either.  At that point i found the Vomero  and fell in love.  its cushioning is much more springy and responsive than pegasus  very reminiscent of pegasus . so id strongly suggest trying a pair of those.  they are a bit more expensive than the pegasus msrp is  i think but you can snag them on sale pretty easily especially now that the vomero  is out and doesnt seem to have many changes over the .  I love them so much i have three pairs  got them for   and .,Nike,d4iwz7f,1,t5_2r4sp

9038050,0,t1_d7y6t9f,Unfortunately thats what price youre going to have to pay to buy them from resellers. supply amp demand Thats kind of why I stepped away from the shoe game. Unless you have a connect in retail youre going to have to camp outside or pay the price. Its sad to see what the shoe game has turned into. Check Facebook groups  as well with caution. There are some good folks that might be able to help you out.,Nike,d7y8ak3,1,t5_2r4sp

9475855,0,t1_d9h3iz9,I mean there are lot of fake shoes and currently there is not a single reliable way for customer to find if the shoe is fake or not unless he buy it from authorized store. There is  simple way to use Bitcoin network to validate the authenticity of each of their products and its cost no more than writing a code on a sticker. ,Nike,d9h3qgd,1,t5_2r4sp
