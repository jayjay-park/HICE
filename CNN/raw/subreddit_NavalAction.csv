6716931,0,t1_d0dfhdn,Fleets are limited to low ranks as training wheels. Do any serious Group PVP and no one will want to group with you if you have AI. They wont be coming back everyone was sailing around with  TrincrdVictory. I know my posts are too long and that is their biggest enemy.  Ive addressed your points in my suggestions.There is no reason why AI fleets cant be an awesome and balanced part of the game at all levels and allow anyone to solo missions without issue. If my idea was implemented the PvP would be no issue.  AI fleets would never appear in offensive PvP combat.  That means you attacking a player in the open ocean or attackin a port.  No fleets ever.  Your fleet would only be used in defensive PvP situations.  People defending themselves in open ocean or defending a port.You do not know that they wont be coming back.  AI fleets would share crew with the player and the player would have to distribute their commanded forces amongst his AI fleet or decide not to do so.  So if you had a big AI ship that is fine but it willSubtract from the troops you may have left for your own boat.  So if you can command  troops your boat could sail alone with .  Or you could sail a ship with  and then have a cutter and a privateer in your fleet Perhaps the crew distribution effects wouldnt kick in until you hit first lieutenant.  Allowing low level players to still have two cutters and their training wheels as you put it.  Once they hit st lt they have to make a decision as to how they want to allocate their crew distribution.  This game is in alpha.  Everything is subject to change. I wouldnt be so sure in your assumptions that something is never going to happen.  ,NavalAction,d0e37fw,1,t5_2zser
6736738,0,t1_d0focum,In a  v  equal battle it is really hard.. We actually managed to do it with . BR or something at oranjestad which came down to part tactic and part luck. Regarding the screening i agree either you have to kill the flag carrier or you need to start as soon as the flag is boughtif its from a close port intercepting it and holding it in battle for several battles. But its a sensitive mechanic its hard to get it right. I have hope that the developers are working hard on this and in time this whole mechanic will change to the betterhopefully when forts and land masses are implementet. ,NavalAction,d0g4xzj,1,t5_2zser

Everyone was so busy building up that when it was time to PVP no one showed up.The point Im trying to make is that the US needs to stop thinking that building up and coming back is whats needed and fight rats rather than AI and not all important fights are PBs.,NavalAction,d1pqc0f,2,t5_2zser
7187059,0,t1_d1v34g6,To me thats the problem. How are players supposed to learn how port battles work unless they participate. Ive watched a lot of port battles on youtube and I recommend that but there is nothing like actually participating. I understand that a clan member has payed for the conquest flag but I payed the same amount of money for the game as they did so they should not be able to keep me from joining port battles.,NavalAction,d1v3uuw,1,t5_2zser
7395232,0,t1_d2iqomr,gt Taking port capture right now for example the best ship is automatically the biggest you can bring regardless of how important the port is.Which makes sense.gtWith a crew system it might not be worth it to ever risk that much crew for inconsequential ports no matter how much crew you have banked.Cost balancing is the least effective form.Moreover my point is about unintended consequences... which there are plenty of and Ive detailed them in other replies.  Discouraging people from playing is not good design.gtI disagree that these changes are counterfun though. In my opinion itll add variety and variety fights boredom from repetition.I think this will always be a bit of a problem in Naval Action.The bigger ship wins unless its so big it cant maneuver against the smaller one and that holds true unless there are multiple ships in which case the bigger ships win.Naval Action fights are going to be pretty simplistic because of this and theres not much you can do.Its not like Eve where they make up a variety of modifiers to compensate  capacitor drainage targetingECMECCM drones armorshieldhull tanking armorshieldhull resists weapon types specific weapon subtypes short vs long range ammo types propulsion modifiers propulsion debuffers tec.You cant realistically add comparable modifiers like that to Naval Action.  In NA ships usually can outgun what they cant outrun and outrun what they cant outgun.  Your options are aim for the hull aim for the masts. Get close and carronade stay long range and gun.  If youre in a much smaller ship you can abuse its maneuverability to abuse your opponent Renommee vs Santi for example but this option disappears as soon as you have more than one opponent even if you compensate with having multiple additional small ships.  One of the two big ones will almost always have a shot at at least one of the smaller opposition.,NavalAction,d2isf3q,1,t5_2zser
