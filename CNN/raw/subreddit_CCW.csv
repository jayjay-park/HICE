155987,0,t3_1vujlh,gtEven if they dropped their guard and I saw an opportunity to break leather and get the drop on them. Because its not worth taking some ones life over a couple of bucks.So at what point is it worth someones life? ? ? ? That is a false choice and the amount of money is a distractor. Perhaps that  is all the grocery money you have left for the week because your significant other lost their job.The only issue here is that the aggressor made a choice to use illegal force or the threat of force to attempt to coerce compliant behavior from his intended victim. Determining whether the aggressor possesses the ability to follow through on their threat and inflict grave bodily harm or death should be the deciding factor. Not the article in question.gtWhat if instead of asking for your wallet they asked for your weapon? As the carrier of a weapon you are responsible for what happens to your firearm. Once again false choice. I am responsible for the actions I take with my sidearm and for choosing to whom I voluntarily surrender my sidearm.gtAnd if its taken there is a very good chance it will be used for crime and possible to take the life of some one else.Irrelevant. If it has been taken i.e. surrendered under duress it is no longer my responsibility. Following that logic you are personally responsible if you give money to a panhandler and he uses that to buy meth goes on a binge and kills somebody.gtIs protecting your weapon from falling into the wrong hands a qualifier for lethal force?I reiterate The choice was made by the aggressor to use illegal force or the threat of force to attempt to cause me to act against my will. Committing a felony. The only factor for me is does the situation meet the criteria of ability opportunity and jeopardy. If the aggressor is asking me for my sidearm the assumption would be that they are displaying equal or greater force multiple attackers bigger gun etc. At that point if my gun leaves the holster it sure as heck isnt going to have the business end pointing anywhere but at them.,CCW,cew75k2,2,t5_2s4mc
156301,0,t1_cew7dll,The question of when the trip becomes interstate is not the full picture.  I would agree that a trip NJgtPA is interstate but that is only one of multiple elements required to qualify for protection under this act.A second requirement that must be met is that you must be departing from any place where you may lawfully possess and carry such firearm what is place and carry?  If place refers to your NJ residence then you would meet this requirement but if place refers to the state as a whole then without a permit and without traveling to an exempted place you no longer qualify for protection under this law because it is not legal for you to carry within the state.Finally even if we can agree that PA gt NJ is interstate travel which I will agree with you it is AND that you are leaving from a place where you can lawfully posses and carry the weapon a stretch in my opinion there still remains the question does FOPA convey protection in the states of origin and desitination or just the intervening states of the trip which is not immediately clear from the act alone.From the Congressional Research Service emphasis minegt There is little jurisprudence interpreting  A but proceedings from the House floor on S. the bill containing the provisions provides some guidance on how this provision could be construed.  More detailed consideration as to the meaning of S. took place during the House floor proceedings as Representative Ron Marlenee of Montana engaged in a colloquy with Representative Bill McCollumn of Florida ...gtgt ...gtgtRepresentative McCollum stated that the provision applies only after individuals leave the boundaries of their State or local jurisdication since  A applies to the interstate transportation of firearms.  Representative McCollum further stated the provision does not modify the State or local laws of the place or origin or the jurisdiction where the trip ends in anyway.  This strongly indicates that  A does not preempt the transportation or possession laws of the destination state and therefore ceases to act as a safe harbor upon arrival at the destination state.Furthermore in reference to lawful possession at the place of origingt While place is not defined the House colloquy states that whatever State and local laws exist regarding transportation at the place of origin of the interstate travel must be satisfied by the person utilizing the safe harbor in section A.Just because we dont have an example of someone challenging this in court yet does not mean that you cant be arrested and charged in NJ with a felony while traveling to PA and based on the information Ive given above I dont want to be the one arguing in court that such a trip should be protected under FOPA.,CCW,cew8fzf,0,t5_2s4mc

I myself dont like the idea of having a safety to deal with on ccw so I went with a Glock . I love it. Some want the safety because they just arent comfortable with having a loaded gun off safety on their person. As long as you are using a decent holster you wont have to worry about your gun going off. Also if you ever had to draw the last thing youre gonna wanna worry about is taking the gun off safety or cocking the hammer back or even racking the slide. So think about what kind of safety features youd like and that can help limit your choices. Also the glock  is  which isnt quite your desired  but it is very easily concealed tucked in or not.

Its ALWAYS windy there.  The rare day when its not windy takes you by surprise and it will cause you anxiety as you anticipate the gusts to start up at any time.  In the winter in places other than Wyoming its nice to take a stroll outside when the temperatures are in the s.  When its in the s in Wyoming youll spend as little time outside as possible.  ...and when it gets cold in Wyoming.  Oh shit it gets cold!

When I was in college still in Wyoming I would wonder to myself why doesnt Wyoming have millions of people like its brother Colorado to the south?

If the odds of ending the threat are  vs the  odds of causing unforeseen damage from a ricochet or debris it doesnt sound entirely unreasonable. This is also completely contingent on how recently the shooting started.

596064,0,t1_cg80nxm,gtStill cant agree with keeping it on you. If you stayed on the phone with the  op long enough then I guarantee you they would tell you to make sure the gun is not on you when police arrive. Youre asking for trouble by being armed when they show up to the scene of a shooting whether it is loaded unloaded holstered or in your hand. This day and age I could even see you getting hit with some bs charge for it that would make your innocence be even more questionable. Unload it and put it on the ground or in your car unless you feel you are still in danger.First why would you even tell the  operator that you have a gun or any other weapon?You call . You state I was attacked and feared for my life I defended myself I need an an ambulance at  anywhere street.You are then free to stay on the phone with  while they record the call. However you dont make any statements you dont say anything just what I said above.The problem with unloading it is that a good lawyer will ask you if you were in fear for your life you will of course say yes and they will ask you then why did you unload your weaponput it in your caron the ground and then you have to try and explain that you were no longer in fear for your life. Where they will then ask you why are you trying to hide the weapon and evidence of your crime. which hopefully your lawyer would object to them using the word crime but you never know.The safest place for your weapon is in its holster specifically designed to hold it. This keeps it safe but accessible should the need arise for you to use it again. Perhaps you only wounded the guy he passed out while you are on the phone he gets up and comes at you with a knife you now have a gun shaped piece of metal which is useless since you just unloaded it.If you are forced to use your weapon asses the situation after the threat is down holster the weapon if you feel you can go back to condition yellow and make your phone call.Do not leave the scene do not move ANYTHING and for god sake dont say anything to the police.,CCW,cg80ylc,1,t5_2s4mc

625442,0,t3_218s5o,Once again condition  carry removes the possibility of accidentally shooting yourself. I dont know why people insist on carrying with a loaded chamber. It takes less than a second to chamber a round. For training simply use an OWB holster on the side of your hip in order to reduce the danger of accidentally shooting yourself. You dont need to train with your holster always being in exactly the same place. Lifting your shirt up grabbing your pistol and then pointing it at your threat really isnt that difficult. The gun lack of community acts like you have to do this a million times before you can effectively defend yourself with a pistol. What you should really train is chambering a round automatically when you draw your pistol and then dumping your mag into targets as quickly and as accurately as possible. Learning to use cover and quickly reloading is also important. A slight variation in where youre carrying your pistol wont make a difference. Train like this,CCW,cgbd3la,-9,t5_2s4mc

775470,0,t1_cgsew20,I applied and had my interview before Peruta was decided so my statement of good cause was submitted under the old must prove heightened danger standard.  That is where my occupation came into play.  Since then the Sheriff has started accepting applications and issuing where the only good cause is self defense without additional circumstances.  After Peruta came out I amended my statement of good cause to include self defense as an additional item of good cause.  My completely unsupported guess is that they continue to issue licenses with this field simply out of inertia... it takes effort to change the configuration of the card printing program they use.When I picked up the card I was given a printout of dont do this shit or you will probably lose your license.  This included consuming alcohol or other substances that impair judgment etc. while carrying and breaking the law.  It also included specific scenarios where I must give notice to the Commander of the Professional Standards Division in writing within a specified number of days moved residences arrested convicted became subject to a restraining order etc..

I particularly like the following The recent CDC report commissioned by Obama states that as many as  million Americans use firearms for defensive purposes every year about  of the entire population . of the adult population. It also states that firearms were more effective than other common means of resistance to attack. Source Bottom line firearms are common and effective means of selfdefense. If every American behaved as well as Floridas CCW permitholders during the first  years of their program the US would have the lowest murder rate of any country in the world. Source Australia virtually eliminated private gun ownership in the s after a mass shooting. Since then gun violence has indeed declined but knife violence has increased. In fact they have more assaults burglaries and rapes than the US. Source The overall homicide rate in the US is down  from the s despite gun ownership being at an alltime high since .   Those following legal avenues to obtain a firearm and concealed carry permit must pass a background check that ensures they do not have a criminal history of felonies or domestic violence.Edit After rereading your last comment still start with the range. It sounds like even if he has handled a firearm before it hasnt been for a long time. Philosophical barriers will be much easier to overcome if theres no physical discomfort. If I were in your shoes I would just invite him to the range every time I went.

990199,0,t1_chgs243,I think a lot of people get wrapped up in the term political correctness and lose the option of the word polite.When we think about being PC its far too easy to brush off peoples feelings in order to push our agenda. If we view the same scenario in terms of what is polite I think it becomes clear what is or is not appropriate. I think it is very impolite to pull out a loaded firearm in a public setting that doesnt specifically relate to firearms. If someone walks in on a person in the act of unholstering their CCW there will be a moment if panic if they didnt witness the initial conversation. It is very impolite to cause that panic.

No one cares if a company just wanted to sell this firearm. If this firearm was offered on the free market it wouldnt be in the news except for a few people commenting on how insanely expensive it is. They care that  years after the first smart gun is sold the people of New Jersey will have no choice but to buy a smart gun. Nonsmart guns will be made illegal to purchase. That is why people dont want it to be sold. It isnt because it is a tactically moronic firearm there are plenty of stupid guns out there that arent fit for anything outside range use already. It is because this firearm being sold will trample the rights of . million people and set a precedent for other states to do so.There are also an estimated . million defensive gun uses a year in this country. The fact that you dont hear about them means nothing more than the media knowing that those kinds of reports dont really gain lots of viewers and ad dollars.

Assuming you pass the background check and know exactly what you want to buy you could theoretically go from walking in the front door to leaving in less than  minutes.For your permit you need to find a class. Look for a gun range nearby as they often have classes. Register and then take the class. Once you pass you make an appointment with the DMV the class should give you the number to call. Then you go in fill out more paper work turn it in along with the certificate saying you passed your permit class then you simply wait.

1252855,1,t1_ciajum5,gt Mostly I called  because if somebody WAS hurt I wanted to already be on the phone with dispatch just to save more time acquiring medical services. This would have definitely lead to my arrest but I would rather take care of somebody that was injured due to my negligence. Crime or not I would have been in the wrong and they would need medical attention.I can see that but in that case you should have called  and simply say I heard a gunshot at X address and thats that while going to check to make sure no one was hurt. They see NDs all the time or calls for car backfires they arent going to send an entire SWAT team for that.gt Also provided that there was a firearm involved I feel like refusing to answer the door if somebody else had called the police could have lead to a very serious and dangerous altercation. Im not a law expert but I believe that if theres a gun involved they dont need a warrant to enter and any sort of misunderstanding would have quickly lead to a fatal shooting.I dont think so unless you kept the gun in your hand andor were aggressive.People confuse standing up for their rights with being an asshole. Be polite with the police be calm and nice but be firm in your rights. When cops show up to the door you dont answer. If cops insist that they are going to forcibly enter tell them youll open the door for them and step out and lock the door behind you. They may insist on coming in check to see if everyone is okay safety perspective or commission of a crime basis in which case they can pretty much do whatever the fuck they want if you got any medications you maybe shouldnt have anything illicit of any kind anything illegal of any nature no im not talking about drugs here could be anything from pirated movies to contraband like banned foods they can charge you with it even though its unrelated to the issue at hand.Dont. Talk. To. Police. Theres a top thread right now about militarization of police and theres even a few cops in there saying dont talk to police avoid police as much as possible. gt I may end up with a criminal record which would be awful. But I suspected and the officers confirmed that calling and reporting it myself would look better than somebody else reporting it and was the right thing to do.Who cares what it looks like? Do you care if a cop thinks your an honorable citizen or a psyched out junkie? Id rather a cop think I was a criminal warlord with them having nothing on me than they think Im an upstanding citizen and having them confiscate my firearm and make me unarmed and give me a criminal record also one that can possibly make it so you can never CCW ever again. Besides many cops are quite jaded they will usually assume you are an asshole right off the bat. In this case they didnt but in many cases they will. Dont concern yourself with pleasing the police. Protect you.I mean this in the most civil way possible but I think you completely underestimate how much the police can ruin your life and furthermore how much your life could have been ruined in this incident simply by interacting with the police. In fact it still can your firearm was confiscated and theres no guarantee youll get it back you may get a CCW violation so you cant ever do that again and you might get a criminal charge and tons of courtlawyer fees anyways. Now maybe nothing happens but lets assume worst case scenario because its a very common and realistic scenario  and it only happened because you talked to the police. I commend you for trying to do the right thing but unfortunately police dont operate that way. They arent your parents. If you try to be the good citizen after an accident the police will fleece you for as much as they can to charge you. Remember theres an overambitious DA and sheriff and police chief above that cop. You might have just irked the attention of some antiA politician or lawyer or judge. You only do a disservice to yourself. Your concern for safety and getting an ambulance because someone was possibly shot was legitimate though in my opinion I think it would be smarter to check to make sure no one was hurt as sending over an ambulance for a gunshot is a little extreme and a high likelihood of an expensive waste of time for some EMTs and the local government... but regardless be polite to the police and dont admit to any crime to the police and dont talk to the police. You can affirm basic things like your identity which you dont even always have to do residence and that you are of completely sound mind but dont admit to crimes dont mention details oh yea well I do have a gun etc. I mean you dont call the police or your boss or whomever any time you make a mistake I think thats a little extreme. Talk to those affected by the accident in question and thats all you need to do. If the police were called out there well dont talk to them but deal with them then. There was no reason for you to call them just to be the first to do that. Thats not exactly how innocence works. I mean you dont call the cops to tell them you speed because you want to tell them before someone else does.,CCW,ciak80w,9,t5_2s4mc

Now...if you have properly prepared yourself trained and you carry a weapon then there are several things you could do in a similar situation that might prevent it or at least lessen the severity of the outcome e.g. noticing hes acting squirrely and backing away from the counter just a bit so that youre just out of reach if he decides to swing at you as well as watching his hands for a weapon and mentally getting ready to draw yours.Oh and heres a mirror in case that goes down.Also this guys still at large so if youre in or around Pensacola take a good look at him please heres the news story ,CCW,cibn9wi,-5,t5_2s4mc

That being said pick up an unloaded . revolver with the hammer down or even a Sig FNH or HK in DA mode without the thumb safety engaged spin it around your finger and wait for it to dry fire. Its pretty hard to get it to do so. Also take onto account that a manual safety is just one more step to take in a self defense situation. Even cops forget about them sometimes.

1577562,0,t1_cjdz32m,NJ is a may not issue state. They claim you can get a CCW permit if you have a good reason or if you require it for work i.e. armored car driversecurity guards. they are only allowed to carry while working and I dont think they are allowed to carry Hollow Points. As far as regular citizens there have been people who were mugged while transporting money for their small businesses and tried applying for a CCW but they were denied and told to hire an armored car service  which is absolutely ridiculous to suggest for a struggling small business in this state. There have been cases where people were being stalkedattacked and they were told that a restraining order would keep them safe and denied the right to CCW.If you know the right people or have a lot of money for a good CCW NJ lawyer then you can probably get a permit but again no hollow points can be carried in your firearms unless you are a LEO. The first time you need to defend your life or the life of your family you will likely over penetrate with an FMJ round and then the liberal media can jump down your throat about how evil guns are. Its a shame that the media has created so many misconceptions of hollow point rounds  claiming they are cop killers or armor piercing when if fact an FMJ is likely to penetrate armor more than any hollow point that I know of.So we can only carry in our homeson our property as well as on the property of a business that you own.Short version dont come to NJ for any reason  example Shaneen Allen NJ google herEdit  replace CCW  with CCP since I think it is called a Concealed Carry Permit in NJ.,CCW,cje0wcw,1,t5_2s4mc

What do DO have is AmericanonAmerican violence which is why CCW is pretty widely accepted and legal. There is a difference between the violence we see everyday here in America and the violence Israel experiences. gtYou suck at reading comprehension. I SAID our situation was not the same but our country is not without its own conflicts amp security issues that warrant an armed society.We DO have an armed society most states offer CCW and here in Michigan weve got a ton of CCWers and its awesome. I think the majority of our country either approves of CCW or can at least see the benefits of it. You cant say the same for them approving of a bunch of civilians walking around armed up with AKs and Ms.... its just not and never will be in American culture for it to be accepted.

1792951,0,t1_ck52onw,I love my  but thats also because Ive been taught and trained how to use a karambit. If you try to use a karambit like you would a regular knife it will be far less effective than just getting a standard straight blade. And then like you said any knife is going to be reliant on how good the user is. Im not an expertbarely competent really in Kali but I understand just enough about knife fighting to know that I would rather fight with my hands then bring a knife into the situation. Which is why I recommend everyone with a CCW mindset should do martial arts at one point or another. You carry guns knives mace tasers etc but very few people in this community have even a basic understanding of hand to hand fighting. I see it all the time in CCW classes Well Im carrying a gun so I dont have to know how to fight. Enough about that rant though. The  is a great knife in this category. This is bar none the fastest deploying folding knife Ive ever owned including auto knives. Just grip the ring and rip it out of your pocket the blade will be open and ready for you to use. The ergonomics are also really great with rounded corners right where they should be and the nice grippy g board. It was a very well thought out design. Only things I dont like about the knife are the liner lockIve never trusted these and that the blade will have slight side to side play if you dont keep it constantly adjusted correctly. ,CCW,ck55gww,1,t5_2s4mc

Only do what the officer asks and move slowly so as not to cause panic.Most cops enjoy working with someone who is obviously not trying to kill them and proving you are not going nuts is worth a lot. Plus CCW is a good citizen badge. You are not a felon on the lam which the officer has to assume up until then.

I wont carry into somewhere that has a no guns sign though I try and avoid those places to begin with or if i know Ill be drinking. Unfortunately that accounts for almost all the time I leave my house. So I dont carry too much outside my home. One of the main reasons I got my CCW is because its just so much easier to buy guns in NC than having to apply for a pistol purchase permit every time you want a gun and waiting. Now its a breeze. Another factor is its great to know the laws and here them from someone in law enforcement. I now know what I can and cant do to defend myself in my home and outside it. Taking the class was so much better than just reading what the laws are. I got a smaller gun so I can carry more comfortably and honestly Im not too worried about only carrying a mm even if its just  shots.

Ive shot one and I didnt find in particularly comfortable to shoot but it seemed well built. But by the time you consider the weight and the cylinder thickness its not as small of a gun as you might think.The Kimber Solo is right out. Any kind of carry gun whose primary criticism is early models were unreliable with x y and z ammunition and about which you cannot also say but they have resolved all reliability issues to complete statistical insignificance is a nonstarter.The LCs seems fine. Ive shot an original LC and didnt think the trigger was as terrible as all that. So if theyve improved it that much it works for me. Seems perfectly fine if you want a singlestack mm at a good price. The thumb safety is halfbaked. I carry an SRc and its thumb safety is easy to manipulate positive and ambidextrous important for me as a lefthanded pistol shooter who likes the HiPower manual of arms.

2553496,0,t1_cmruwfi,Yeah this radio is probably the most popular starter radio. That works on the M band which has a range of a couple miles. There are a lot of repeaters in the M band though if you live near a big city in the US. Many are networked with other repeaters too so its possible to talk with people all over the US via M.In general ham radio is for whatever you want it to be for. In terms of practical uses its used for communication while on the road similar to CB communication in disastersemergencies or communication while huntingcampinghiking. Its also used for more casual purposes to talk to astronauts on the ISS or to chat with other random operators in other countries across the globe. Global communication requires use of a lower frequency than the M band though so that sort of thing isnt possible with a handheld. Many people also have fun building their own antennas and tinkering with radios and that sort of thing.Most ham radios have a scan mode but they are terribly slow. Mine is barely faster than one frequency hop per second. If you want to stay up on trafficpolice events and that sort of thing youre better off with a dedicated scanner or hitting the CB frequencies. Also in my area the emergency services have switched to a digital trunked system so theres no way to pick it up with an analog radio. Its still possible to listen to digital systems as long as they arent encrypted but you need special equipment.You can have a radio and listenscan without a license.

The reason why I say I dont think so even though what you said sounds right is that if a landlord is a serial house robber and robs his own tenants then he gets a lesser charge whenever he is caught doing it just because he has masterkeys? He gets trespass while the burglar who breaks the window gets breaking and entering felonies? It doesnt seem fair. It makes it seem like as a landlord you have an easier time being a serial robber if you have the keys.But if you use a BUMP KEY to open the door to someones house technically you didnt break in you just illegally trespassed?If a burglar enters your house because your door is open and starts looking around your houses valuables but doesnt take anything and the police happen to be there and catch him do they charge him with breaking and entering or illegal trespass?

2796598,0,t1_cnlvexj,Ive been carrying for only about  months. To be honest the Shield wasnt uncomfortable and I really liked the gun and how it shot. I was very accurate with it and comfortable drawing and firing at the range. I work in law enforcement and because my Sig doesnt have a safety I tended to carry the Shield with the safety off. I purchased the Shield for a great price before they released the nonsafety version. I dont have a really good reason for selling the Shield I just want to see what else is out there and dont have the extra money to purchase a third handgun. So I figure I could sell it make an educated decision for another carry weapon maybe smaller.. To diversify and hope that it works well for me. Based on the next year with my new gun Ill be able to decide wether I like a smaller gun or I want the Shield again. Thats my thought process at least.. Possibly flawed haha..

You probably wont run into any problems but Charlotte has its fair share of areas where carrying a firearm is in a legal gray area. Many bars clubs and concert areas will pat you down before letting you enter their establishment. Are you going to be uptown? In the university area? You should also be aware that you may have your firearm with you on UNCCs campus in your vehicle but once you park it must be securely locked in a compartment within your vehicle. Under no circumstances should you exit your vehicle on campus with your firearm. This is probably a no brainercommon knowledge but I thought I should probably throw this out there. Not trying to deter you at all but its probably worth mentioning that in my three years living in the university area and three years living near Concord mills outside of a range or gun shop I have never seen a civilian open carrying.

3398921,0,t1_cpfoemf,While I have seen signs like the one OP posted I havent seen any that prohibit either and thats exactly why I think these we allow guns because nd amendment is unnecessary. There are plenty of ways of showing support for the nd amendment beyond making it the cornerstone of your establishment. Or half the front door at least. These signs exist only as bait to get gun lovers to walk in the door. One commentator below stated they know a place that doesnt actively shove it in your face but when you get inside you know they are supporters of the nd amendment. I think thats how it should be. But thats just my opinion so I know it doesnt speak for everyone. I guess Im just not one of the gun lovers who needs to let everyone know. Id rather live life with my gun concealed and as if it were part of me instead of defining part of who I am. And that includes eating wherever I please instead of the places that try to lure me in with cheap tricks.

I say this because first impression of the law is the person that calls and reports is the victim.  Had he seen the gun and called the police and lied saying you brandished it threateningly for no reason you would probably need to lawyer up to prove otherwise because the police are going to wonder why if you didnt feel threatened enough to call the police you felt threatened enough to draw a firearm.I saw this happen first hand in court a young guy and his girl were in front of the judge because he pulled a handgun on three guys trying to force their way into his car after an altercation at a bar.  Per the police report once of the aggressors was over  and  lbs. the guy that drew was like  and maybe  so his lawyer was obviously pushing self defense.  Regardless he was having a tough time getting a break because the other guys called the police and accused him of brandishing.,CCW,cphsky6,8,t5_2s4mc

It started with the perfectly logical idea that it shouldnt be a womans fault if she gets raped IE due to being flirty or wearing suggestive clothing.However the concept of rape is never a womans fault got expanded into stopping rape is never a womans responsibility.  Factor in that most womens groups are usually antigun because a gun is seen as a thing used by a man to exert power over a woman and you get the following logic  We should not have guns because men use guns when raping women!  Women dont need guns because we shouldnt need them!  The problem is not unarmed woman its rapist men!  Now thats all good in theory in theory nobody should commit rape ever for any reason and with that Im sure we all can agree .

3582598,0,t1_cq0lpnv,I have read all of these cases. I have even applied the two step framework for evaluating the constitutionality of regulations on the Second Amendment established in Ezell v. City of Chicago. The biggest problem I am having right now is showing that the universitys weapon policy is not narrowly tailored to the universitys interest of preventing gun violence. The biggest hurdle is what the Supreme Court stated in Frisby v. Schultz i.e. a regulation is narrowly tailored as long as it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the evil it seeks to remedy. Undoubtedly a weapons policy that prohibits the possession of firearms eliminates the source of evil caused by firearms. How exactly could I overcome this? ,CCW,cq0n87m,1,t5_2s4mc

Instead I dress respectfully and remain approachable so that others will ask me questions about the legal carry of firearms in my state. I have no issue with OC vs CC I conceal on occasion.  And I agree some go about this the wrong way. But the only reason I openly carry is to educate others. Its something I am willing to do because its important to me.

First youd be placing your gun in an area where you cant see someone coming unless you have eyes in the back of your head.  Additionally if someone comes up behind you seeking only to grab your wallet huzzah they now have a firearm to attack you with.  Second if you feel them reaching in your back pocket and you try to retain your gun you dont have as much leverage on their wristhand because you are reaching behind your back.  They will probably still end up with it.Third every time Ive ever lost anything out of a pocket it has been something that slipped out of a back pocket after sittinggetting up from a chair.

3820567,0,t3_33unfm,Ive owned lots of these pocket pistols over the years. The two I still own are the Glock  and the KelTec PAT.  KelTec PAT very easy to conceal decent to shoot but NOT fun for extended range use. Some people call KelTec junk but I have about  rounds through mine with absolutely zero failures of any kind even when limpwristing shooting one handed etc. Very lightweight gun so the recoil is very snappy and uncomfortable to shoot more than  rounds at a time.  The Ruger LCP is basically the same gun and if I didnt already own a PAT that works great Id buy the LCP instead. Glock  substantially larger than the PATLCP but MUCH MUCH easier and nicer to shoot. Same capacity much less felt recoil and I can shoot it FAR more accurately. A little big for pocket carry but its totally doable. I carry this most every day and have never been called out. If anything it looks like a carry a decentsized wallet in my pocket. This has become my  daily carry.Thoughts about other pocket pistols Ive ownedKahr PM very nice wellmade gun but feels a little fat and chunky for pocket carry. The recoil is much snappier than my Glock .Smith  This definitely works for some people but not for me. Despite it having a great draw from the pocket its actually quite large and the grip could possibly protrude from your pockets depending on how deep they are.  rds instead of  and I honestly cant shoot it for shit. Snappy as fuck. I have pure respect for revolver guys but Im a semiauto guy. Also ballistically Id MUCH rather have  rounds of . through any barrel over  rounds of . special through a   barrel.Seecamp  this was actually too small for me to pocket carry. Despite the best pocket holster I could find it would occasionally fall onto its side or even upside down in my pockets. NOPE! Incredibly well made guns beautifully crafted. A bit snappy and difficult to grip well and shoot well. The one gun that is suggested a lot that I have not tried is the Sig P. I have a feeling this would also be an awesome choice.,CCW,cqrrxxl,1,t5_2s4mc

Will some folks find it offensive that Id dare go out in such a manner? Yes. Will some thing me crazy for doing such a thing? Oh my yes. Might I be crazy if doing such a thing seems the best course of action? Possibly. But if everything Im doing is legal and above board then what right does anyone have to tell me I cant? What right would they have to stop me? If the law says I can and I so choose then everyone would be getting in a huff over nothing of consequence.As for your questions what if thats his only gun for defense? What if hes just another OCer genuinely trying to flex his rights and help educate anyone willing to ask about the rights we have as mostly free citizens? Who cares what his pick of defense gun is so long as he uses and carries it safely its nobodys business but his. So what if hes showing off? Looky here at my wonderful shiny ARgat! Sure hed be making a right cock of himself but again so long as everything is legal and safe why does it matter?No it isnt so great for our image but maybe we should stop worrying so much about image and worry more about education and inclusion. We ought to be educating folks on the fence and helping people who have questions. The biggest complaint against progun folks is how exclusive they are. We need to reach out help people get into shooting or at least educate them and show them that yeah maybe this dude seems scary with an AR in the airport but hes being safe responsible and if Heaven forbid anything were to happen hed be first on scene ready to help as best he could.

I do like the idea of buying the  compact and buying a  subcompact frame and getting more versatility out of it.  But it seems like capacity among other things are the same on these three guns so I am trying to find any distinguishing factors besides looks.

Lawful Ownership Possession and Use of Firearms and Other Weapons Possession in Private Conveyance.Notwithstanding subsection  it is lawful and is not a violation of s. . for a person  years of age or older to possess a concealed firearm or other weapon for self defense or other lawful purpose within the interior of a private conveyance without a license if the firearm or other weapon is securely encased or is otherwise not readily accessible for immediate use. Nothing herein contained prohibits the carrying of a legal firearm other than a handgun anywhere in a private conveyance when such firearm is being carried for a lawful use. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize the carrying of a concealed firearm or other weapon on the person. This subsection shall be liberally construed in favor of the lawful use ownership and possession of firearms and other weapons including lawful selfdefense as provided in s. ... Definitions. As Used in This Chapter Except Where the Context Otherwise Requires Securely encased means in a glove compartment whether or not locked snapped in a holster in a gun case whether or not locked in a zippered gun case or in a closed box or container which requires a lid or cover to be opened for access.So here is the confusing part. This is talking about WITHOUT a license how you can carry in your car concealed. Since Florida is a NO open carry state it seems that a firearm other than a handgun i.e. shotgun would also have to be concealed. Does this section require that if it is carried hence concealed within your car even with a license then it has to be done so in a case or container as described?Ive tried to ascertain a more definitive answer online and cant seem to get a clear cut answer.

Im not saying this only because its dangerous but because theres a chance the safety will get flicked on while the holster shifts in your pocket. If youve never practiced flicking it off as you draw you may find yourself in the unpleasant situation of getting a click instead of a boom when in a life or death situation.

I went with the P because in such a small and light gun the greatly increased recoil of . over . is going to mitigate any benefit from the larger round. Other benefits to the P over the PAT are the increased capacity rd vs. rd magazine  and the PAT lacks a slide stop to hold open on the last round which the P has.Ive put  rounds through the P so far. The recoil is comparable to a full size mm and the trigger pull is great  although somewhat long being DAO it is extremely light. The sights are actually pretty good despite how tiny they are. I shoot it well enough at  feet that Im more confident carrying it than my Jframe .spl.I carry Sellier amp Bellot gr FMJ in mine. JHP . ACP rounds are shorter and because its a semirimmed cartridge they can lock up in the mag unless you use a shim. The european FMJ rounds are the most powerful .

5194372,0,t1_cvbum5a,gt real kydex instead of injection molded plastic.Spoken like someone who doesnt know a damn thing about polymers.  Injection molding is a manufacturing process and can be used with a vast array of materials from metals to candy bars.  Alien Gear uses Boltaron for their thermoformed shells as opposed to Kydex but using the same thermoforming manufacturing process used by every other company in the hybrid holster industry.  Speaking as a product designer who has spent their entire career working RampD for polymer and FRP products Boltaron is vastly superior to Kydex in this application.  It has far better tensile and shear strength.  Ill copy and paste my discussion on this because Ive covered it too many times to count  gtgt I second the request for explanation on the advantagesdisadvantages on Boltaron v Kydex.gtgt If you get some time. A simpletons post about them would be greatly appreciatedgt Absolutely!  gt Advantages of Boltaron  In terms of the material itself Boltaron has fantastic performance in shear and tensile strength probably the best performance for anything remotely in that price point and substantially better than Kydex.  This becomes a huge factor for the application considering you have structurallycompromising holes placed in close proximity to the edge of the material Im referring to the screw holes and rivets.  Over time poor quality material would allow these holes to bend warp tear and crack through the edge of the material. This would compromise the performance of the holster and result in complete product failure.gt I have heard rumors around the internet that Alien Gears Boltaron shells are injection molded google alien gear injection molded.  I dont believe thats true.  Coming from a background in polymer products I can tell materials and manufacturing methods rather quickly.  But sometimes Im wrong.  If its true AG is using injection molding and I dont believe this is true it would again speak highly of the product.  In terms of the manufacturing methods injection molding allows precise control over the uniformity of the material and amount of material being used.  This allows the manufacturer to dial in manufacturing costs and quality control very precisely.  Contrasting this to the thermoforming of Kydex thermoforming stretches the material inconsistently and causes weak spots namingly on surface contours.gt Disadvantages of Boltaron  If its true that these Boltaron shells are injection molded the tooling costs would be far more expensive than Kydex thermoform molds.  gt Advantages of Kydex Cheap.  Thermoforming molds can be made at home.gt tldr Alien Gear did it right.,CCW,cvc46ik,21,t5_2s4mc

5357892,0,t3_3ocndf,I think this is a very bad idea.. I dont think that this is very ergonomic.  Youre using your hand to push a big door out of the way which is likely to mess up your grip.  Also that door may very well channel your index finger into the trigger guard.  Also it looks like the lock would release before the shooter can get a firing grip on the weapon possibly resulting in the gun falling to the ground.. Look at where you put this on the stroller.  When carrying with a baby your first priority needs to be getting the baby out of harms way and the second priority is to get your gun.  If someone does this then the holster is in an awkward position to get to.  If someone does not to this then theres a high likelihood of flagging the baby during the draw and presentation.  And then theyd be firing over the baby in all likelihood i.e. threat to the front and if the threat drops then the shooter will follow that threat down instinctively... which will place their baby back into the line of fire.  Terrible terrible terrible.. Rod into the muzzle.  Bad idea.  Its unnecessary if the holster is designed properly and just presents an opportunity for something to break off and obstruct the muzzle.  . Im not a fan of any holster designed to store a gun in close proximity to a child.  Its unlikely that the child in the stroller would be able to get to the gun but still.  Also many families have two or more children and when the youngest is in the stroller the older is walking right next to the stroller which would be right next to the holster.  Dont get me wrong kids should be introduced to guns early but theres a difference between allowing children to handle guns in a controlled environment and putting them next to a holster that they can access in public.  And a child in a stroller is likely too young to handle guns at all.. Seems easy for a thief to grab.  Like really really easy for a thief to grab.  Especially if the parent walks to the front of the stroller to take the child out or the kid is out of the stroller and the stroller is sitting next to the parent.. Seems easy for a child to grab if the stroller is taken to a place with children e.g. park toy store etc. which seems likely given that its a stroller.  Young children are curious and most of them wont have had any exposure to guns other than in the movies due to headinthesand parenting from antigun parents.  Easily accessible guns around uneducated children is a recipe for unpleasantness.. At some point the gun is going to have to be transferred from the stroller to another holster or to wherever its stored e.g. lockbox etc.  Doing this while trying to wrangle children sounds like a bad idea and leaving the gun in the holster unattended also seems bad but there may be ways around this.You said that this is for your wife who doesnt want to carry on her person.  Has she considered carrying in a purse or bag?  There are plenty of holsters designed for offbodycarry that would probably be less expensive than making a new one from scratch and they have proven track records for safety.,CCW,cvwj501,2,t5_2s4mc

From our analysis our holsters cost  more than competitors yet ours sell for  the price. Please dont confuse price with quality. Out shells are thicker and more expensive than almost everyone. Our backers are much more expensive to make than a leather backer. The labor is much more to make our four part backer that is hand sewn than leather backers. The three main reasons our prices are lower are highly efficient manufacturing and purchasing processes selling direct no middle man markup and not being greedy on profits.

5458736,0,t1_cw9e2ez,Everything that is commonly understood about self defense tells us that you cannot assume that you will have the time to draw chamber a round get on target and fire a shot. The average distance for a lethal force encounter is  yards and theyre typically over in about  seconds. If youre decently well trained you can probably draw a fully loaded pistol from concealment in about . seconds. That time is much higher if you also have to chamber a round. Your attacker could be on top of you stabbing you to death before you even have time to get yourself on target much less fire a single round that may or may not end the fight.Even if you did train this way you are training yourself to be showing up to the fight much slower than you have to. You simply do not have as much time as you think you will have. Whats more your version of events presupposes that you will have two free hands. Thats not a given. So if you dont youre fucked. It also supposes that you dont jam the pistol by trying to load it in the chaos of a lethal force encounter. Sure you can rack that slide without too many problems when youre on the range and its a nice day. But what if someone is trying to stab you? Did you short stroke it? Is it out of battery? You are approaching a lethal force encounter the completely wrong way. You want to plan for everything to go wrong so that youre able to triumph in the most broad number of situations possible. To your last point it IS dangerous because as I said elsewhere at least a few people have died because they thought they would have time to chamber a round. They didnt. Lastly and most importantly. Carrying with a round chambered is perfectly safe. There is no reason not to do it. You invest in a quality holster a quality firearm and you take note if that holster starts to show signs of wear etc. Its not rocket science. People that have negligent discharges have them first and foremost because they broke the rules of firearm safety andor because they were not carrying in a holster not because they were carrying with a round in the chamber. I suggest you go take a twoday class from a competent CCW instructor. You will hear my sentiments echoed. ,CCW,cw9elkf,1,t5_2s4mc

5755021,0,t1_cxafpvt,Its a great video. Ive seen it several times over the last  years and make it a point to go back and watch it every year or two. But its not allencompassing. Ive also gotten a lot out of Ayoobs advice which is also not all encompassing but raises some very salient points. One of the cases highlighted in his most recent book included an SD shooting where a victim who was attacked in his own driveway chose not to talk to the police. The attackersthere were  or claimed that the fight started in the street where all parties voluntarily engaged in a fight before the shooter pulled a gun. The story of mutual combat in the street of course was a completely different narrative than the truth of a man attacked on his own property. The evidence backed up the attackers the casings from his handgun had rolled down into the street as round things are prone to do on inclines.He was found guilty the first time then eventually got off on appeal. By the time all was said and done he did some time in jail lost his job wife divorced him and he burned through tens of thousands in lawyers fees before being kicked loose. Had he given a bare bones statement to establish himself as the victim versus remaining silent and letting others statements overlayed on the evidence paint him as a crazy person with a gun who voluntarily got into a fight there may not have even been a trial. SD being an affirmative defense ones guilt in the sense of having fired a gun wont be in dispute.

Instead it just drives those who are undecided about the issue away and into the arms of the antigun crowd and all the while you are left saying but im not with those guys. Think of it from a business perspective.  Have you ever heard about NPS net promoter score?  Basically you ask people to score how likely they are going to recommend you to a friend on a  scale with  being never and  being very likely.  You then subtract the detractors those who score  from the promoters  and .  Really good companies like Apple have a  NPS score.  Now when companies are trying to raise their NPS score do you think they go after those who are in the  detractors range the  passive range or the  promoters range?  Most strategies call for working on those  range since wasting time on promoters doesnt raise the score and some detractors wont ever be won over so go after those who are in the middle.  Bring those in the middle over into the promoter range and you now have more people promoting your company which generally equates into more people purchasing your product as you have more people actively promoting your company. The NRA is basically doing the exact opposite instead of trying to draw in those who are undecided the passives they are driving them away. The undecided are hearing about taking guns from peoples cold dead hands and this other rhetoric that paints gun owners as being extremists.  And who do these undecided then run to?

The issue here is what constitutes controlled entry. Apparently there were even some lawsuits about it as well. Just something else to research. I dont personally pay attention to signs.

One coughed loudly bending forward and reached into his inside jacket pocket.  The other man saw a shiny metallic glint coming out of the pocket so drew his gun and shot the first man killing him.Unknown to the shooter the man who coughed had Tuberculosis and was pulling out a metal case containing medicine.In court the prosecution and defense were very thorough in covering the issues involved in the shooting and whether it was justified.

6127387,0,t3_3zg2ye,Shoot to kill and shoot to wound are both wrong.  Shoot to stop.If youre already at the point where a gun is needed the goal is to end the danger as quickly as possible.  Ideally that is no shots the gun alone is enough to scare off an attacker.  Unfortunately thats not always an option so you next fire the minimum number of shots to stop the threat.Always aim for center mass.  Under stress no one can consistently hit an arm or leg and trying to do so just makes it more likely that youll miss both giving an attacker more time to advance and creating a chance of hitting an innocent bystander. I believe that everyone who can should own and carry a gun and be prepared to defend themselves with it.  But being prepared means accepting the fact that in a him or me situation it has to be him.  If someone cant be ok with that they need a can of pepper spray and some good running shoes. ,CCW,cym4c8z,10,t5_2s4mc

If they stopped it after  victims they mitigated the damage the shooter could have caused but they didnt stop a mass shooting since it already met the qualifications.We can understand this and therefore know that events that had the potential to become mass shootings are likely stopped more than we know but as you said the CCW prevented it from getting to the point that it went on the books as a mass shooting.,CCW,cyzpvia,2,t5_2s4mc

Governmentmandated testing before you can exercise your Godgiven and Constitutionallyprotected RIGHT?  Over fifty years ago we as a country fought governmentmandated testing in order to exercise constitutional rights.  There are only four words our founding fathers used to describe how the second amendment should be implemented.  Four words.  Four Goddam words.  . Shall. Not. Be. InfringedWhich part is confusing?  And you people want a governmentmandated test in order to practice your Constitutional right?  I saw the words common sense gun control being used in a few of these comments.  When we allow the government the power to decide what is common sense we ladies and gentlemen have lost our common sense.  We are the ones who need to be enforcing gun control not the government.  To allow the government to enforce gun control on any level is far out of the scope of their duty and for a good Goddam reason.  Common sense gun control is the guy behind the local gun store counter asking to see Bob Doe Jr.s proof that he attended an NRA course before he sells him a firearm.  Common sense gun control is not your government requiring you to mail in your test scores to their Records Division and they allow you to carry a gun if you passed their test.  Do you even understand how blatantly tyrannical and unconstitutional that is?  If that is common sense then we have lost all power to the government.  They won.  We lost.    ,CCW,czej9hs,4,t5_2s4mc

I saw one and ordered within  minutes and thought wow. They need a ccw version it would be amazing. And so I emailed the company and they sent me a link to this one. Turns out my brilliant idea had already been done. So I cancelled my order and went with the ccw version. I cant wait for mine to come in the mail. It adjust every  inch so you can let it fit perfectly and the belt doesnt dig into your gut if you have one. This was a main concern for me because I HATE when buckles dig into my gut.

Theres almost no way that you will be able to chamber a round before his shot takes you out.If you are in a situation where you ableneed to conceal yourself then there is almost no way that you can chamber a round silently.

I like the retention straps snap as opposed to velcro and its nice that the strap itself serves as another layer of retention  if you dont move it out of the way with your thumb as you draw you arent getting it out which makes even an unsnapped strap unlikely to let loose accidentally from jolts nudges or hanging upside down.  The latter is occasionally a factor for me do to a few things I do during the day.Interesting point about the calf strap.

There is an interesting documentary on netflix called Making a Murderer watch that if you want to see how far prosecutors will go to get a conviction.  Your innocence is not presumed in todays court system.  The mere fact you are in a court room as a defendant is going to give most jurors the idea that you must have done something wrong.  Couple that with with jury selection and using anecdotal evidence to discredit you its going to be a tough road for your defense.Save fancy back plates and inscriptions for your range weapons but personally I wouldnt even do that.,CCW,d13r8jz,3,t5_2s4mc

Expansion of the acp is . with . of penetration. Even if they made a perfectly cylindrical wound the difference between them is minimal. Unfortunately tissue expands so that wound channel tends to be a lot smaller than the actual bullet. Heres the picture of the grHeres the picture of the grNot much of a difference between the best ones from each picture.gtSimply put more case powder  more damage done.Simply maybe but stating it that way shows your clear lack of knowledge of how case volume projectile weight etc. affect energy of a particular cartridge. You have some cartridges which can use powders with higher energy density and higher case pressure to allow more energy with less powder.  gt.. and thats BLAZING for the powderpuff mm and .. for a .ACP P or . Super.. seconds for  rounds is an extra shot per second. Its more than you seem to think. Not only that but you can be more accurate if you take that little extra time to shoot more accurately. gtIf youre so concerned about recoil why dont you carry a PMR or Grendel P? fraction of the recoil of even the MM and  rounds in the mag.Because you need a round that can at least reach the minimum penetration required by FBI tests. You also need a round that can retain weight. Smaller bullets such as lr that expand tend to shed weight or explode which gives less than desired results. Thats why everyone tends to gravitate towards the big  rounds used today. Theres really no significant difference between acp and mm as far as wounding mechanics go. Youre much better off with a more compact ammo lighter ammo softer shooting ammo and cheaper ammo. If you train more are more accurate and can shoot faster than mm is clearly the better choice than the CHANCE that your slightly bigger bullet knicks an important arty.

I dont honestly recall if it was just talking or if he was an idiot and throwing things at them or what. But shortly thereafter a at the time OLD man came out with a rifle and started yelling at us. One of my friends was shot by a BB. Back then we just moved off and played in a different area and I never really thought about it.

After a long awkward moment of silence he asked for ID and that is when I handed both my TDL and my CHL IDs In my state I must notify my CCW status when asked for identification.

My only issue with Second Call is that you appear to be locked into one of their house defense attorneys which may or may not be a good option given the location where you are charged. Also the limits on the entrylevel plan are inadequate to offer much of anything. IMO the premiums on the higher levels are so high that given the relative risk of ever having to shoot someone and also running into a prosecutor interested in prosecuting you if the shoot was good it probably isnt a good riskreward option. ,CCW,d1s277u,3,t5_2s4mc

7366638,0,t1_d2fimzj,Ive never said you said birdshot was the best or that it penetrates the best or anything.  Ive only ever said recommending birdshot for selfdefense is completely idiotic which is something the entire last paragraph of the linked article of this thread does even going so far as to say birdshot is more effective than any given handgun caliber.  Youve been trying to argue that birdshot is actually a good choice for selfdefense.  Ive simply been trying to show you how incorrect you are about this the entire time and youve failed to do so thus far.  Further all of your sources are literally peoples opinions on blogs.  Thats not really anything that holds water.  Again this entire time Ive simply been saying that birdshot is something that should not ever be considered a reliable round for selfdefense even when being compared to handguns.  You apparently feel otherwise however simply because surely that will stop someone.So let me address your two points directlygt.  Shotguns are multiple times better stoppers than pistols.That depends entirely on the ammunition being used...gt. Birdshot is a viable defensive option .......and birdshot is not it.  Hopefully that is direct enough for you.If youre truly worried about overpenetration and decide to use a shotgun instead of a handgun or a rifle for home defense all with appropriate ammunition  buckshot JHPs ballistic tips respectively for a general rule of thumb then learn to aim for the hips andor just have a planned lane of fire if it ever comes to gunsout in your own home.  Youll shatter the pelvis sever the femoral artery and make them incapable of moving all while having a downward trajectory with the projectiles.

The jump up to a g from a Shield is a significant size width and weight increase. I urge you to consider hanging onto the Shield so that you can still carry just as easily.A gun the size of a g is quite a bit more uncomfortable and requires more compromise wardrobe accommodations concealment considerations etc to carry than a Shield.I started with a similar size and gradually decreased size until I ended up with a Shield and carry that despite having larger alternatives. I shoot the larger frames better but can shoot the Shield at selfdefense distances ltyd with selfdefense accuracy  group rapid fire.It feels good emotionally to carry a bigger heavier gun but be sure the extent that it feels bad physically doesnt deter you from carrying.,CCW,d2hvl9x,2,t5_2s4mc

7401492,0,t1_d2ib6hw,gt  If I go for the gun when I should have went pepper spray its not a big deal as long as I dont drop the hammer on themUnfortunately this is not true in many places. You can be charged with a crime menacing or a similar charge in many places simply for drawing a firearm when it was not justified. Check your state laws.gtbut going for the spray when I should have went for my gun could be catastrophic.This is a fairly involved mixed question of facts and tactics.Lets break it down. Bad guy is coming at you or yelling in a menacing fashion. You fail to observe bad guys already drawn knife or gun. Since you didnt see the weapon you should not have drawn your gun in most situations. If you have no other option you are now empty handed. If you have pepper spray you now have pepper spray vs. a knife or drawn gun.  Not AT ALL an ideal situation. But much better than empty handed vs. a gun or knife. Pepper spray will almost certainly get you away from the knife alive if you also have some empty hand skills you may have to dodge or block a halfblind stab or two before you run or draw and shoot. You may have to sweat a shot or two from the pistol before he is blinded but theres a good chance he misses or gets nonlethal hits on you.. You draw pepper spray bad guy draws weapon at the same time. You can probably blind the guy before he gets a good stab at you or before he gets an aimed shot with the pistol. Then you run away or maybe draw and shoot depending on your states laws the threat to innocents etc.. Bad guy comes at you unarmed THEN bad guys buddies that you didnt know were there jump in. With no intermediate weapon you had no right to draw the gun initially so youre in a fist fight with bad guy. Quickly you are in a fist fight with multiple attackers probably giving you the right to shoot but its going to be very hard to draw.With pepper spray you blind bad guy and easily disengage or quickly stop them with punches and kicks. Bad guys friends may be dissuaded but if they jump in you can pepper spray them too or draw if you are genuinely fearful for your life and fire without initial bad guy hampering you too much.gtAnother potential issue is freezing up.Yes this is real. Thats why we need to train multiple phases empty hand intermediate force drawing in the middle of a fight and firing. Even with the analysis paralysis of having an extra option Id rather have my pepper spray for nonlethal threats than face a weapon I didnt see emptyhanded or face a felony for drawing in a marginal situation.gtThats a hell of OODA especially when youre taken by surprise.Have you ever considered getting a stun gun or something on your flashlight? There are some that can be carried fairly easily. These are obviously not  ideal I prefer pepper spray because of the distance but they would give you  simple options flashlight gun and you would have a big leg up in a fistfight.,CCW,d2ji1ef,2,t5_2s4mc

Out of a short barrel you get close to  inches of penetration you can expect more expansion and less penetration out of longer barrels due to the increase in FPS. This plus the fact this ammo is so affordable you can actually test your ammo and not break the bank.  I was talking to a local cop and he was telling me that his department Moderate sized city was considering dumping the  SampW HST because of a situation where rounds were not penetrating deep enough to cause significant injury to bring down bad guys.

If there is a malfunction with a handgun the general school of thought is to drop the magazine rack the slide and reload.If you can carry a spare part do so.That said... the odds of you being in a place in a fight where you will have the time and space to reload are tremendously small. Reloading fast and under pressure is hard especially if you dont practice regularly. Beyond that carrying extra magazines is significantly more uncomfortable than carrying a firearm on its own. To be entirely honest Id rather carry a a primary and a backup gun than a gun and two extra magazines.If this is legal in your jurisdiction perhaps keep a spare magazine or two in your vehicle.,CCW,d38wd2q,5,t5_2s4mc

7747149,0,t1_d3mrt0e,There is only about  of an inch above the holster.  The mag pouches are surprisingly large so you can really tuck them down. I havent handled a g since Christmas but iirc your mags might have an eighth of an inch or so on mine. The FNS has  round mags as well but is the size of the g. Main difference in the mags again iirc is that mine are flush fit and glock mags kinda stick out of the well a bit.  Ill post a picture tomorrow and show how they set.As a side note if you are ever in the market for a compact really take a look at the FNSC. The ergonomics are very similar to glock except everything except the take down lever is ambidextrous. It has either  round or  round mags. Just like any other gun there is about a  cycle break in of the firing assembly but once the trigger breaks in you can easily dump a mag accurately in a couple seconds. Hickock has a great video on it. Only problem is finding someone who has one in stock as FNS really doesnt focus on the civilian market since they took over the colt military contracts. Here in NC either the compact standard or long slide cost . Im not a rep for any company just making a recommendation of my experience. ,CCW,d3msltg,2,t5_2s4mc

7899073,0,t3_4ngkps,OP Ive carried almost exclusively deep concealment since I turned . Ive got a few recommendations and tips for you. Its important to consider tradeoffs. The deeper you conceal the more difficult time youll have drawing if need be. Ive personally always considered it better to have a firearm that takes a few seconds extra to get to than none at all. I think the biggest thing to consider is your activity level.I see youre a janitor so this section wont help you much. I carried off body through college using a . Push pack private University misdemeanor to be caught with it in my state college had private security with no legal right to hold you or search bags. While it was not entirely legal I had practically zero chance of being caught. It served my needs perfectly at the time as it allowed me to carry things necessary for school as well as having a concealed carry pocket. I was constantly vigilant of where the bag was at all times. If it was not on my person then it was in on the floor with the strap on my leg. If you work an office job where you sit at a desk  of the time this is something to consider. If you are at all forgetful of objects I would not consider it for even a moment. Im happy to say that throughout the years I carried it I left it somewhere accidentally exactly once... At home when I meant to bring it with me. Small tip if you go with the push pack the way the top flap opens covers up the zippered pocket nicely. I passed multiple security guards movie theaters museums similar with them not even checking that pocket by doing this. I tried pocket carry for a while. Its obviously a good middle ground between off body and deeper concealment. My biggest issue with it was that I use my pockets for things like my phone wallet and keys and didnt like the adjustment period. I also didnt feel like it prevented issues like printing enough to trust it but at that point I was working an active job and had to move around a lot. Ive now settled on a unique holster called the Urban Carry. Ive had it for about half a year now and Im very happy with it. I own this design and carry a bersa thunder . in it. Printing is almost impossible and I can comfortably do very active things while wearing it. Ive paired it with a thick ratcheting belt and have the ability to comfortably draw or adjust the sit of it with speed. My father is a retired cop and he had no clue I was even carrying it for a while because its that hard to eyeball. The biggest downsides are that it almost requires two hands Ive practiced an awkward one handed draw and its very difficult to draw whole sitting but pocket carry has a similar problem depending on your pants. I think it would be the perfect solution for you. ,CCW,d43xha7,3,t5_2s4mc

Throwing around a fun phrase like armchair warrior is cool and all but statistics are an accumulation of millions of boolean expressions of real life.

8183832,0,t3_4qwml4,It depends heavily on where you live I think.  I live in Las Vegas in an affluent suburb about  mins from the strip and I open carry about  of the time when I go out around town on errands.  Here you dont need a license to open carry you do need a permit to concealed carry.  People are somewhat used to seeing openly carried guns here.  Its not super common but if you live here long enough you see it and everyone seems to be pretty familiar with the fact that its legal.  Ive never had a bad reaction while open carrying. The vast majority of people dont even notice.  Usually the only people who notice are security guards at entrances to places like Smiths and Walmart and none of them have ever said anything to me probably because they are trained that its legal.  The open carryconcealed carry debate will probably never end.  I think it depends highly on the type of area you live in what the gun culture is there how comfortable people are with guns etc.  My personal opinion due to where I live is that I am proopen carry because the culture in my area is not against it and I think it helps for people to get used to seeing people carrying guns.  I previously lived in Los Angeles and before that New Jersey so as you can imagine the first time I saw someone OCing in Nevada I was a little freaked out.  But after educating myself on guns and seeing it more and more that shock went away and now I dont even think about it.  I believe that people seeing me and other good law abiding people OCing can have the same positive effect it had on my views about guns.  I believe the more good people that open carry the more comfortable the public will become with it and the more itll rewire peoples brains to view carrying in a positive light.  Repeated exposure is what will train people to accept people who carry and view it as a positive thing.Youll have to make the judgement call for yourself whether you live in an area that will accept you OCing or whether its just not going to be worth the hassle to have people freaking out on you and calling the cops which again is rare  of stories about OCing end in nothing happened and no one noticed . ,CCW,d50j2gg,1,t5_2s4mc

NDs are just unfortunate lapses of judgement that could be avoided whether that was immediately apparent to the discharger is irrelevant if we are discussing the absolute safety potential of guns with respect to safe practices.  still comes out to only about  times higher than the number I originally came up with which is still astronomically small.It is an irrational fear because its based on what is unknown to the debater they do not know or care about how safely a gun can be handled but do know the potential dangers involved.

8607434,0,t3_4xq811,Bought a stock mm Shield a few months ago. Spent a lot of time at the range with it noted where in my opinion improvements could be made and finally got around to doing them. Basically it ended up like a Performance Center Shield minus the barrel porting and thumb safety. Yeah sure I couldve just bought the Performance Center version but I didnt want the barrel porting or the safety.List of mods Replaced the guide rod with a stainless steel one from ssguiderods.com. The factorysupplied guide rod had a spring that was so stiff it was difficult to rack Im   eat lightning amp crap thunder even after breakin so this mod was a must. Did this about  weeks ago and havent experienced any failures while putting about  rounds a week through it. Apex trigger amp action enhancement kit. No matter how much I trained I still a bit of grit in the trigger pull which became prominent at  yards and out. I know you arent supposed to shoot a tiny little gun that far but I knew it could be improved. The Apex kit smoothed out the action and is a HUGE improvement over the stock trigger and action. Its a winner. Tru Glo fiber optic sights. You gotta yank out the rear sight to do the Apex action enhancement so I figured while I was in there I might as well throw in a set of fiber optic sights. No they are not tritium and and I wont be able to see them in pitch blackness. Mainly I just put them on because I like their look.Tools used punch  punch white lithium grease red locktite big ol rubber mallet calipers for centering the new sights bench vice about  hours total for the trigger kit amp sights.

I used to be one of the naysayers of Glocks because they lacked manual safety well I have since been converted. Dont quote me but I think many of the NDs with Glocks are simply from breaking down the gun to clean since you have to pull the trigger. While we probably all agree that its not a good idea it isnt that big of a deal as long as you have common sense for safety. The fact these people are pulling the trigger without properly clearing the weapon tells us all we need to know which is that they were being negligent.,CCW,d6kto3j,2,t5_2s4mc

8642272,0,t3_4y2f4i,Well theres a couple points of interest here that you should keep in mind. Most people who like a stiff belt are carrying full loads. Firearm asp spare magazines ect. Also they tend to use stiffer belts for heavier guns. This is why you get a wide range of people that answer what type of belt you get. Because as mentioned an soe belt wont do this but still works because you can cinch it down tight. A leather belt needs to primarily not collapse when you have something on it. I.E you squeeze the sides and it doesnt fold into a taco. This causes a holster to cant in weird directions or flop over or cause the firearm to fall out when running. What you have there is good and the test is really to find out if the belts side walls will buckle. While it does work for some people no matter how thick or stiff of a belt you get. It wont defy gravity and keep your pants up definitively. But it can offload weight for you by making it even. ,CCW,d6lw6vg,1,t5_2s4mc

8787699,0,t3_50ezt4,To echo a couple of other people and my own thoughts Id want more than the  shots coming out of my shield if things go south. Ive got a full sized MampP that Im getting a conceal carry holster for but other wise I carry a shield too. But that shield is small single stack and something just enough to get me and mine to safety and away from whatever immediate threat there is. If possible Id upgrade your capacity and go for a compact or full sized MampP purely because of the capacity difference....and because youre almost expecting to be in a situation where youll need your firearm. At most in your shield youll have  rounds first time through then another . On the C or full sized you have the option to effectively double your round count to  first time through. Which is why I carry a full sized for duty state certifiedlicensed rentacop. I saw somewhere in the comments someone made the suggestion to carry all the time even at home. This is a great suggestion given your current situation. As for your  get a good buck shot and keep it at a fall back point in your house. Hopefully you have somewhere that can act as a fatal funnel while you just sit back and wait. In my apartment its my bedroom...because its at the end of the hallway and theres no other way to get back there. seriously Good luck OP I hope you never have to use your firearms that no harm comes to you and yours and that your sister gets cleaned up stays sober and safe,CCW,d744ws3,1,t5_2s4mc

10317108,0,t3_5np790,I posted this on thickheaded thursday on rguns tooMy front sight is loose on my RIA .  No local gunsmiths want to touch it they are very basic gunsmiths.  It appears to be a dovetail with almost novak but still nonstandard dimensions.  Should I attempt to do this myself or send it back to RIA and be out a carry gun for possibly weeks?Background info  The sight was probably loose from the factory and its only had  rounds through it in about  months.  I have added stiffer springs its a mm installed a short trigger new grip bushings and grips and fitted a new flat bottom firing pin stop all myself via watching youtube videos.  Sights are pretty important though so I wasnt sure if I should attempt it. The sight wiggles about half the width of the post and isnt in the correct spot to begin with rear sights whole way to the right to make it shoot straight confirmed with another shooter trying them.

10331438,0,t1_dcf26nq,I live in Austin go to UT and I have a CHL. These comments are all so out of touch its absurd. As long as your roommates arent keeping kilograms of weed in the apartment APD are not going to just bust in and charge you with a felony. Even if they did AND charged you for having a firearm in the mix youd have so much to fall back on as proof you werent involved youd have to have Mr. Magoo as your defense attorney to be caught with any charges. A simple drug test and proof that the apartment complex signs you up together and you didnt know them before you signed would be more than enough for any lawyer worth their salt to handle.This of course is assuming youre EVER going to get in trouble for marijuana use in house around campus. I mean Christ West Campus has  Smoke shops within  blocks of each other. Theres so many people smoking that if the APD took the time to toss every student living situation with weed into prison UT wouldnt have very many students. On top of that even if you all were caught the worst punishment youd ever reasonably see is getting evicted which would suck but nothing to sweat jail time on. My point is that while it is a nonzero possibility that youd be charged with firearm possession and drug pedaling the odds of that are so fucking unlikely that you also might as well go get yourself tested for Dracunculiasis a super rare parasite that feeds off your brain. But hey as long as were losing sleep over things that could happen but have functional probabilities of zero might as well tack that on the list.,CCW,dcf4jud,12,t5_2s4mc

OP mentioned his stats    Lbs.  I realize I am assuming here so be it. OP bought and is carrying the CCW for self defense and a feeling of confidence in being able to defend himself in case of a violent attack upon the person..  This was a VERY SLOW developping situation.  The large money requesting nice car driver made no physically threatening moves just didnt go away.  There was no assault just annoyance.  I agree the very real possibility of physical battery was there but the person never banged in the car windows doors made any threats if you dont X Ill Y.  He just didnt leave OP alone.  .  If you cant see the value of realizing that knowing that buying a gun getting a CCW and strapping up doesnt prepare you for all the situations you will encounter out in the wild..  Get additional tactical training.  .  Move.  Move.  Move.  Fucking move if you stay stationary you will get shot stabbed grabbed punched whatever.  Move.OP should have driven away.

10405989,0,t1_dcnh1i8,Im also right handed  left eye dominant and have always used Chapman which is a straight right arm bent left variant of Weaver who kept both arms bent.  Hickok  shoots the same way and has a video explaining it on YouTube.The concept with both is to push out with the right and pull in with the left to create stability. Arrange the left hand over the right so the elbow points down to prevent the gun from yawing as it recoils. Stance is  to target not squaredoff as with Isosceles.The criticism of Weaver  Chapman is that the  stance limits the ability to pivot and shoot in the opposite direction but that problem is solved by moving the lead foot.

10469632,0,t3_5pygh3,When I first bought a pistol in   after Reagan was elected  I entered a IPSC competitions to get some practical training.The biggest lesson learned was move and seek cover before engaging when possible.  Being accurate and fast doesnt prevent you from being shot and killed.  Being accurate and fast shooting from cover helps you win competitions and stay alive in an actual DGU situation.Competitions have two components. One is technical skill stages where you knock down plates or put a specified sequence of shots on targets with mandatory reloads. The other are Hogans Alley scenarios where you deal with target which pop up which might be a crook or an innocent and overlapping targets simulating a hostage situation where a shot between the eyes is needed to neutralize the bad guy but a miss of  kills the hostage. The practical stages teach one to think move shoot and reload strategically and to expect the unexpected and choose targets and field of fire carefully.I focused on accuracy over time because technical stages reward it and practical stages penalize lack of it.  If one focuses on accurate shooting  paying conscious attention to grip stance how arm triangle reacts to recoil etc.  speed increases with practice.I didnt continue competing because I went overseas and had to put my guns in storage but I credit it for changing my mindset and how I would approach a DGU situation.,CCW,dcuu92l,3,t5_2s4mc

10524810,0,t1_dd12vlm,Youre right in that the hypocrisy of my position is lawful incarceration. There is a lot of evil out there and some of it needs to be locked away and rehabilitation attempted. Rights to keep amp bear arms should be suspended while one is incarcerated but restored immediately upon release. This is how I feel such due process should be handed.gtthe government could never take private property for public useI am very wary of this ability because it has been abused in the past. It is a complex topic but so are all that invoke the public and especially the public good. People make assumptions that the public will approve of their position amp actions when the public is really a sort of illusory perception and not at all indicative of the will of The People. When the government says it has to take what is mine for the good of all according to a few people on a committee I am naturally suspicious of that good of all reasoning. If the government does not protect ones private property rights and instead seizes property say on a pretext of charging it with a civil offense drug asset seizure then why should we protect the governments property rights? Fear? Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station!gtthe entire criminal justice system should be abolishedDisagreed.

10833682,0,t3_5uvxve,gt  I look for maximum penetration over in as well as expansionThe problem with this is that anything that is going to penetrate  of gel is not going to expand very well. Expansion means that its ballistic coefficient is severely reduced a mushroom shape experiences massive drag through a fluid and every mm of gel it goes through will further slow the bullet down and reduce its KE for further penetration. A JHP that can penetrate further than  has essentially not expanded at all. gt Im of the school of thought that energy transfer doesnt killEnergy transfer alone does not kill. However if you want the hollowpoint to expand sufficiently it is going to have to lose a lot of energy to try and overcome that fluid drag to continue penetrating. Good JHPs like Federal HST can do this AND still penetrate to . Bad JHPs like G RIP can only expand at shallow depth making them poor choices. Other bad choices that penetrate deeply dont expand well and behave like FMJs. gt The likelihood of a bullet going through a bad guy and killing someone else is infinitesimal thoughA round that penetrates more than  means that after penetrating the average person it will still retain enough energy to effect a potentially lethal wound within  yards. At  of penetration it will still be lethal  yards away and at over  of penetration it will still be lethal at  yards. gt why not maximum penetration and maximum expansionThe two are inversely related that is penetration is often limited by expansion or vice versa the sweet spot is to get both and that happens to be around  of penetration as in HSTs until you get to mm Auto or P . Magnum neither of which are particularly suited to concealed carry. ,CCW,ddxf265,4,t5_2s4mc

But how do I know that I didnt fuck something up?  Like if I didnt quite set the recoil spring in right or if it is underlubed and the next time I shoot it it will fire the first round but then malfunction?  Would it make sense if I am going to the range to shoot  of my pistols to fire my third pistol that has been cleaned just once at the range?

11097268,0,t3_5y3vfl,A friend of my wife said something not too long ago that struck me.  Her dad was LEO and always carried when they went out.  But he put the fear of God in his kids about touching his gun.  So much so that to this day she is terrified to even have one in the house when the relatives visit.  Dad did a great job of making sure she wouldnt play with his gun... but it was approached as guns are scary and dangerous not you are too young to handle it by yourself so let me be present when I show it to you.  She said she gets very full on nervous and shaky when it comes to touching one.  Her poor husband will probably never be able to hunt again or own one for protection which we were just talking about not too far back and he would probably get something if he knew his wife wouldnt give him heck because shes scared for their kids safety.I chose not to hide my gun from my kids.  Partly so they dont turn out like my wifes friend partly because I love shooting and Im not hiding my hobbies from my kids and partly because my little one has been so freaking observant since birth! that Id never be able to hide it.  We still gotta work on the not outing daddy in public thing they are too little to have a filter yet lol though.

11145421,0,t1_dev87vk,You have  options. Mexican carry around the house unloaded.  That should show the areas that really dont work and give you an idea for possible locations to try..  Get a cheap single clip holster or something sticky if the gun is smaller and try it in all sorts of positions.  This will highlight the areas that wont work for you and show you good areas.  Some areas will be uncomfortable that may be fine if you had a good holster but the very bad areas are still going to be very bad..  Only buy from people with refundstrial periods.  Even losing a few bucks for shipping or restocking is better than the price of the whole thing.  The downside is if you are newer it may take you longer than their trial period to really determine what carry location works best for you..

Printing in pants has never been a problem for me. It is really just the grip you have to worry about. I carry a snub nose revolver with no issues but you could easily carry any of the singlestack mms out there with a good holster. Carry appendix or strong side with some forward cant and it is easy.  As far as reaching up thats just something you have to learn. If you carry on the right side reach up with your left hand etc. There is no real way around this problem aside from being conscious of it. Even if you wear super duper long shirts you end up looking frumpy and it slows your draw down anyway.

11779881,0,t3_680h3j,Three things  Start bending at the knees. Carry a tiny gun that doesnt have much of a grip poking out. Learn the picard maneuver a quick unobtrusive tug of the shirt that nobody notices if you dont make it obvious. This and the fact that you can be more easily disarmed amp have a slower draw are the downsides to carrying in the rear. When I carry in the  o clock position especially with a larger handgun I do this every time I stand up from a chair or get out of the car. Its automatic now.,CCW,dgvacgq,3,t5_2s4mc
11780465,0,t3_67zvpl,Galco I use the jackass because the magazines are covered completely.  The Miami II is also sweet. Both have awesome concealment and more comfort than anything Ive ever used. If I dont wear a jacket or coat I cant use it. But for me this is my favorite. ,CCW,dgvcqhn,1,t5_2s4mc

11793486,0,t3_689xsj,It depends entirely on your relationships with those people. If you feel theres some sort of negative judgement associated with concealed carry maybe it is best to keep it to yourself as much as possible. If you have a more open relationship those are the people you should be able to trust the most but I know thats not always the case. Is it possible that some of them are asking because they are curious about it for themselves and are looking to you for information? ,CCW,dgwtxxe,3,t5_2s4mc

11799705,0,t1_dgxg9j5,I was trained to use the overthetopoftherearoftherail grip but I was also expressly trained to let it slam home on its own and never to ride it forward.  Its ingrained at this point.  I dont ride it forward when chambering a round.The only time I gently bring it forward is when Im field stripping it as I get it back to normal position before releasing the rail with a trigger pull. But when chambering a round?  No never.  Pull release and let it do its thing.  And honestly I find the grip I was trained with to provide more overall control of the balance of the weapon with the grips involved.  Im trying to imagine doing it with just two fingers from the rear as Ive seen in the diagrams for my weapons and it seems like a recipe for slippage and an early release before you intend to release it.To each their own but the grip I was taught can be used safely if youre also trained to flatout release it and it becomes ingrained.  Im  rounds in and Ive yet to have a malfunction which wasnt a bad round.  One was missing a primer pin during my first training session and the other was just yesterday and would not fire in the Glock  I was trying out not even my weapon...was test driving dutysized pistols.  That was also my first need for a taprackfire and blessedly I knew what to do.  Didnt even need a trip to the RSO.  ,CCW,dgxjcot,1,t5_2s4mc
11800181,0,t3_68d7e4,Solid lessons learned friend but my big takeaway from this was that you seem to have excellent situational awareness. Well done but for these scenarios exactly I carry at all times because you just never know. Something to consider if you have the money is getting a pocket gun for those moments where your main carry isnt feasible. I have an LCP for those occasions. i dont carry at work or walking tofrom my car otherwise Im armed even at home. ,CCW,dgxlaqa,27,t5_2s4mc
11800344,0,t1_dgwxenj,Any movement of the mag can tap the bullet in deeper. Compound this with months of daily carry without ever checking and its doable. The opposite is true with revolvers. Their bullets tend to want to fall out of the case and is why revolver specific rounds are crimped at the top and not the bottom of the bullet  like semi auto rounds are. ,CCW,dgxlypi,3,t5_2s4mc
