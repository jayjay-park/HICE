Also who paid for his shoes all this time it must be getting pretty expensive.  You can fool all of the people some of the time or some of the people all of the time. You can never fool all of the people all of the time. In a week or two the truth about this will come out and people will scream that someone should have prevented this from happening.

3158402,0,t1_copckwo,Im an alcoholic. I suffer from depression. I can tell you that there is an extremely high likelihood that they were both present. If that wasnt the case for that particular person then good for them. However theres no way you could have known that all this person needed was some tough love and time to sort it out. I left a great friend at the bar because I was tired of hearing how unhappy he was while he got more hammered. It ruined at least one night nearly every weekend. I put a few beers in the hole for him asked someone to make sure he could get home and went on to chase whatever girl interested me at the time. That night he finally felt abandoned and miserable enough or something Ill never know that he locked the garage with the car running. It took nearly ten years before I stopped beating myself up about that night.Im grateful that your friend has pulled through and seems to be having a better life than before but I highly recommend never using this type of game plan in the future. Theres a big difference between someone whos an annoying drunk and someone who only reaches out when theyre socially lubricated enough to do so. ,MadeMeSmile,copd6z9,6,t5_2uqcm

3204375,0,t1_cotxo1e,...What selindsipity said crazy emotional nonstop screeching super needy and very hormonal. Its true people are abandoning them in droves or relegating them to their basement or their garages alone and without the attention they need. Totally heartbreaking.So why do I have cockatoos?Ignorance  I fell for their number one plus point the incredible crazy sweet cuddliness. I laughed myself silly watching their varied antics. I just adored that side of them still do always will. There is really nothing sweeter softer and more cuddleable than a cockatoo and they have a ridiculous sense of humor that makes me howl with laughter.Patience  I learned more about patience from having to adapt to my needy little screeching white bugger birds than from anything else in my life.Love  yeah ok thats really it. I adore them and I guess I just take the cuddling and the funniness together with the screeching mess and other problems as a package.  I realize now that I adapted my entire life social and business to them and despite the screeching and hormonal plucking and occasional nipping I could not imagine being without them. Absolutely everything makes them happy even just having a good scream which catches your attention. They are very very needy in just about every department but especially for attention!However I do NOT recommend that anyone get a cockatoo especially not an Umbrella or Moluccan because chances are pretty good you will not be able to give them everything they need to be happy and healthy or you may for a while and then stop because the endless annoying noise and the vast amounts of dust.Did I mention they are so dusty that when you pet them your hands get covered in fine white powder? So does everything else in your house. Our computers have to be taken outside opened and blown out with a leaf blower every month. Clouds of dust come out  its almost unbelievable that  little white birds weighing a little over a pound each could generate that volume of dust in a room  feet away from their cages but there you go.As I mentioned cockatoos  definitely not a good pet bird. I cant help but get sad when I think of all the abandoned toos who were just being their screeching messy destructive selves . And although I am committed to mine for life and its been over  years weve been together  I totally believe cockatoos are happier and saner among their own kind in an aviary with informed care.,MadeMeSmile,cou4sge,11,t5_2uqcm

5381445,0,t1_cvypp3n,A couple of years ago me and my friend were hanging out at a park when we noticed a bird stuck in a gate. I thought it was dead because it wasnt moving. As we got closer it started freaking out. I wanted to help it because we live in Texas and this was during the Summer so it wouldve died for sure. My friend wanted to cut the leg off that was stuck in the fence as it was already broken from the bird jerking around so much. I wouldnt let him because even though his heart was in the right place it was unnecessary. After a bit of us trying to work its leg out of the gate and avoiding its sharp beak it eventually calmed down. It was like it knew we were just trying to help it. That made it much easier to get it unstuck. So hes unstuck and hops around on the ground for a bit seeming like hes already used to one legged life. He then turns around and stares at us for a minute or so then flies away. I dont know if he was thanking us but I felt good about what we did. ,MadeMeSmile,cvzjgnw,2,t5_2uqcm

There arent sensors it is based of the joint movement of her elbow. So as she opens and closes her elbow joint through cord tension in the d hand it opens and closes the hand. The goal for these was to make them really affordable and easy for children who grow really fast to have one that fits as they grow.Heres the website They have different designs some based on elbow movement like the one above and some based on wrist movement so that if someone just lost fingers as opposed to the whole hand they could have a functional model.

Now pretend that on top of that you both are the leaders of nations that have historically been on opposite sides of nearly ending the world. A familiarity on a scale that none of us will ever know. But neither of you are your countries pasts you are their present and future. Youve always been pretty wary of each other and youre tired of it.Tomorrow you meet up for a private lunch and a drink. Then things seem to be going well and you have another. Youre having fun actually and another. This guys not so bad. Another dri  oh shit we have to face the world this better be the last one. Alright down it. Now we have to go give a speech.Youre out there in front of the cameras trying to be straight faced.  The world is watching as you two you representatives of the lions share of the stress and tension of the modern geopolitical stage are expected to discuss the progress youve made. Then he tells a joke and you crack a smile. Then he slurs his words a little bit and you chuckle. He looks at you with a smirk and just like that the absurdity hits you.

8267404,0,t1_d5ao27b,This is true of all but one of the dogs Ive owned. Ive had  dogs  of them were family dogs growing up and none of them liked it. Theyd let you do it for a couple seconds and then squirm to get out. My current dog though is an American BulldogBoxer rescue who had a pretty rough go at life. He was  and a half when I got him and I was already his th owner and his only good owner at that point. I could go on and on about him because hes ridiculously weird in the best kind of way but this is about hugs... Ive never met a dog that actually enjoys hugs but my dog will let you hug him lean into you pant and was his tail and if you let go he just stays leaning on you and lets you hug him again. I wouldnt hug a dog much if they didnt like it but I hug him all the time because he really seems to enjoy it especially if I kiss and pet him while Im doing it. Hes possibly the most affectionate dog Ive ever met  Damnit now I want to hug him... ,MadeMeSmile,d5azett,5,t5_2uqcm

Also in the UK we only really tip waiters and waitresses and maybe occasionally people helping you move big heavy stiff. From the outside again it looks like in the US you tip just about everyone for just about everything. Also some other countries tipping is even less than the UK Japan for example its often considered an insult partly because youre saying that the establishment is too cheap to pay their staff properly. ,MadeMeSmile,d5fqmnh,2,t5_2uqcm

I believe you will make an excellent addition to my comfort on said couch. Up she climbs. Ever had lbs of mastiff try to be stealthy? They are not. In fact they are so notstealthy that they should be accompanied by a tuba playing entrance music. Bless her heart though shed try to be as sneaky as possible. However the anvilsized head and snuffling breathing kinda gave her away as she tried to insinuate herself onto my lap. And by lap I mean entire torso and legs.

10834793,0,t1_ddx76r8,Babies are born far sighted. This is because the lens cannot flex. The muscles that flex the lens are not developed yet. When the muscles make the lens bulge it is called accommodation.  Kids start accommodating at normal levels at about  years old. Also theres this special part of the retina called the fovea centralis that has shit ton of cones on it. Its about the size of a head of a pin. This is where you want light to focus so you can see as clear as possible. Babies can not do this because the light is focused behind the retina due to the lens not being able to bulge correctly. So no its not completely wrong.E also the procedure they give kids to see again is basically pointless if the kid has an astigmatism which makes the cornea really bumpy. This makes their vision blurry because its a very rough prism. But light hits the cornea before it hits the lens. So these tests are a total waste of time and money. Just wait till your kids five. Glasses are frieking expensive jabroni.,MadeMeSmile,ddxj6n4,1,t5_2uqcm
10842541,0,t1_ddyba7n,gt Hes also concerned about the growing number of ketamine clinics that are popping up around the country where people with depression can receive infusions of ketamine via IV. Some of those clinics arent run by psychiatrists or mental health professionals he says but by anesthesiologists and pain physicians who may not have as refined training about how best to use ketamine for depression. I worry about how well people are screened and because this is a drug of abuse whether people are screened for drug abuse as well he says.????gt Some doctors and patients are not waiting for the pharmaceutical industry. Because ketamine has long been approved for anesthesia doctors are allowed to use it offlabel to treat depression. Clinics charge from  to more than  per treatment. Insurance rarely covers the cost.
