541151,0,t3_20bgl8,i think dummeys  hit on something for your bug two. I disagree with getting rid of the of the yVelocity  yVelocity and just setting it equal to something but i agree there is something that seems redundant or unnecessary about some of that logic. I believe the pauses where there for the debugging.Having yVelocityyVelocity i.e. reverse is how it will bounce back up if it comes down on it or how it will bounce back down if it comes up on it. You need to get rid of the lines where you set yVelocity equal to something. lines  Your setting it to a negative and then reversing it so it will always be positive. Thats why the ball will just keep blazing downward destroying everything in its path.If you want to keep increase the y velocity as it breaks the higher blocks which i think its a nice touchbut i probably would have just scrapped the whole idea once you start having problems you might want to add if statements to check if the ball is coming down on it i.e. yVelocity is positive or if its coming up on it i.e. yVelocity is negative then setting setting yVelocity equal to something correspondingly. Then you could get rid of the reverse and just have two yVelocity s for each scenario. Im sure theres other or better ways of doing it but thats just what came to mind first. As far as bug  is concerned my initial thought is that since you have a changing yVelocity and a collision bug that only happens some of the time that it might have some thing to do with it moving too fast. Sometimes it may not satisfy statements where your checking for its ovation since it jumped over it. Thats just speaking in general with collisions. Im not entirely sure thats the case here. But you may just want to try scrapping the whole changing of the yVelocity altogether and that may help fix both problems. Get a working game first and then you can go back later and try tweaking it to make it more fun.I hope i helped at all and that you were able to follow any of it. Bottom line is i know what your problems is with bug  and bug  may take further looking into.,LaunchCodeCS50x,cg1sa7r,1,t5_2zpkx

We are planning on doing some crazy stuff so expect to see python java and node.js all being written and talking to each other via rabbitmq and mongodb.,LaunchCodeCS50x,cjxk1g4,3,t5_2zpkx
