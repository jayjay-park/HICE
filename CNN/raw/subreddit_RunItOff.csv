5590377,0,t3_3rnqf7,When I started out to run it off I was living at home and only had limited control over my meals dinners were non negotiable.  But by being smart about how I ate early in the day it was ok.I was very strict for the first couple of months basically no snacks at all  only ate at breakfast time and lunch and Ill be honest i felt pretty hungry at times.  BUT I got through because I picked foods that would leave me feeling satisfied for a long time with few calories.For breakfast I religiously ate  weetbix with exactly  of a cup of skim milk. It was only about kj but it got me through.  I used the oatbran weetbix so the extra fibre meant I was full for longer.For lunch I had lentil soup or Borscht Russian beet soup.  Again lots of fibre and protein and I could eat  cups thats about a quart I guess and get through most of the afternoon.If I really needed a snack I went with zerosugar coke or pepsi.  It was like cheating because I would feel fuller but with zero calories.  Maybe not healthy but it was great.Oatmeal sounds like a great idea I do dry oats for breakfast now but what are you doing for lunch?,RunItOff,cwq1ems,1,t5_3an3w
