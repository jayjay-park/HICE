10539629,0,t1_dd2s4hj,gt tooYou being a grammar nazi isnt helping your cause. just proves that you are a smartass.also there is a hell of a big difference between modding a sub with  subscribers and modding a default or a large one that you want.You have no idea what it is like. and you are asking for top mod spot? kden,needamod,dd2s8bn,1,t5_2r2oo

10949084,0,t1_de9arln,I think the hardest part of this would be organiztion.Allow everyone to choose their allegiance with a flag flair. Everyone can comment on anything. But only certain people can actually speakmake decisions for a country. To gain that position one would send a request for whatever country they want to the mods and we can give them an Official Ambassador flair that states they are given the final say in a countrys matters. The wiki can have a list of unclaimed countries. Each country can have their own model UN sub but thats up to the Ambassador. The Ambassadors are also the only approved submitters so they are the only ones who can make posts regarding a nation. Everyone is still allowed to comment.I would also suggest writing a charter on the wiki.As far as why I should be a mod I would be extremely active and I love the idea of growing a sub. I could reach out to other subs to get advertisement and recognition that would help get our name out there. This is sub has a chance to grow into a Huge multisub community. And it definitely will with me as a mod.If you like these ideas I would also like to submit my application for ambassador for the United States. I am an American irl thought ambassadorships shouldnt me limited to those from their respective countries and I am getting in on the ground floor much like the States did with the UN. The UN charter was signed in San Francisco and the UN headquarters are in NYC so my position as one of the first readers and possibly a mod of this sub is similar to the United States position in the UN. Thank you for your consideration. ,needamod,de9bjtn,2,t5_2r2oo

11526302,0,t3_64j5sj,Here are five questions to help people who want to recruit you know what youre like. What are your interestswhat type of sub would you prefer to mod?. Are you willing to mod a NSFW sub?. How active are you Eg hours per day and what timezone are you in?. If you see a highly upvoted post but it doesnt follow the rules what would you do?. In your opinion what is the most important quality a mod can have?There is no requirement to answer these questions if you are offering services only as a CSS wiki or bot moderator.I am a bot.
