4729241,0,t1_ctqkbee,In the system updates it pretty clearly says Installed Friday May  ...    However something was installed yesterday and the fact that the notification board takes me to a dead link doesnt fill me with confidence.  Im also not a fan of autoinstalled updates given amazons penchant for bricking jailbroken fire tablets. ,firephone,ctqnu4t,1,t5_328bd

5116718,0,t1_cv2lb8g,I think I have the ATampT version which I unlock on a TMobile sim with the provided unlock code.  Then I flashed version .. for USunlocked GSM onto it to fix the Play Store white screen problem.  So far so good using Nova from Play Store.  It hasnt tried to OTA to the problematic ATampT .. yet.I put CM on the other one I got for my inlaws and that works pretty well too save for camera issue.  You can always go back to stock if it doesnt meet your needs.,firephone,cv2r81m,1,t5_328bd

7338403,0,t1_d296ran,Installing CM onto the Fire Phone will turn the phone into a normal Android phone. See the Fire Phone is running a heavily modified version of Android called FireOS made by Amazon. Many people do not like this however because of its compatibility performance and visual style. FireOS limits what the phone can do and hinders its full potential.CM aims to fix this by delivering an almost stock Android experience something you would see on a normal Android phone. But because Amazon doesnt like that we the community are installing this they made the phone to try and stop us so there are some things they were and to hinder the function of. And even though the list is the shortest its ever been you should still look at the Known Issues part of the thread before installing.Hope this helped! If you have any more questions feel tee to ask!,firephone,d2cbqzr,2,t5_328bd
8605482,0,t3_4xmlcy,Where you running CM SlimKat or FireNexus? If soIt depends. If you login to Google Device Manager and say erase it will factory reset your phone and he will have access to use it but not access to your personal files as you erased them.If you do not have any sensitive information on the phone things you are okay with the perpetrator seeing if they plug it into a computer then i would suggest setting a PIN through Google Device Manager instead. The reason for this is the Fire Phone is more complicated then the average phone making the perpetrator wont be able to use the phone until they are able to figure it out and while it isnt rocket science the hope is that he gives up and tries to sell it. And since you reported it to the police or should have already! they might be caught.If you have FireOS then Id suggest wiping it if you have sensitive information on it. If you dont then the perpetrator can as you can easily boot to recovery and select wipe. If hes stolen a phone before he knows this if hes an amateur then hell try activating the phone at a carrier or sell it which will again raise alarms because you reported it stolen or should do now if you havent!Sorry for the theft I hope this helps!,firephone,d6ha31z,4,t5_328bd
9234344,0,t3_56u9jm,My Fire Phone is not my daily use phone more of a hobby project  nd camera for video stuff.  When I ran into weirdness while trying different ROMS launchers etc several months ago I discovered the easiest least frustrating way to start over was to simply download the latest firmware from Amazons support site and follow their clear amp simple instructions to reflash the phone nuking it back to stock with the latest FireOS version.  ,firephone,d8mir7p,5,t5_328bd
