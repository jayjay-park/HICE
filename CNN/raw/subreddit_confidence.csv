I could have though if I tried so I suppose less would have worked well.,confidence,cfuuzpc,2,t5_2rmn5

2049431,0,t3_2ia3xj,Ive experienced similar feelings and it sucks big time. My advice is  get back into talk therapy and stick with it a while if you can. Spend more time doing things that make you happy right now rather than doing things you should  this was huge for me. Time spent doing things that make you happy is not wasted. Also journaling has helped me be able to sort out my destructive thoughts from ones that are more helpful. Remember you are not your thoughts and some thoughts can enter your mind and leave again without you buying into the idea. Look at mindfulness for more about this. Good luck there are people who care for you and even though your brain may tell you otherwise you deserve to be happy ,confidence,cl0bsyq,3,t5_2rmn5

2840618,0,t3_2slpyp,You gotta own up who you are man. Low selfesteem is not attractive. If you are a bit chubby right now then just own the fact because there is nothing you can do about it in the shortterm. Low selfesteem is  more of a deal breaker than some fat in your belly and boobs.Weve all been there. Making these moves is always risky you may get burned or you may not. Ask yourself if you do get burned this time so what? Think what you did wrong and try again. Failure is not such a big fucking deal as we make it out to be excuse the cursing. You adapt and try again. Such is life.As long as youre too petrified to take risks you wont be getting anywhere in your life. Life begins at the end of your comfort zone. Always when in doubt or when scared think about what youd think of yourself if you let this opportunity pass. You lose  of the shots you dont take.Ive been there once man. Making the first romantic moves of your life is scary as hell. You just have to do it anyway. Preferably when not drunk too. Sure maybe the girl will do the moves on you too in these times of gender equality. But dont count on it. Girls dig it when you show your intentions with confidence faked or real.,confidence,cnqz43g,1,t5_2rmn5

3113960,0,t3_2vpcd0,I ended up asking a friends advice as he had more experience with aspergers so Ill add in his thoughts.  Not having aspergers I cant say if this is good advice or not.  But I hope it helps. I do think SokrPotato is onto something too though.  Not just is it important to accept where you are in life as a step to gaining confidence more on this in a mo but people are also good at recognizing when people are faking.  They dont always know what doesnt feel right but they know something doesnt feel right and its right to respect that.We make connections by finding our similarities not our differences.  When Ive been on dates sometimes youre both nervous and just admitting youre nervous or find it hard to start talking is the thing that helps you both start and relax into the conversation.Firstly whatever your situation accept it as it stands and be as kind to yourself as possible.  Even if theres something about yourself you dont like just accept that hating it for now doesnt change it.  Next take responsibility for this  You are where you are but you dont have to stay where you are.  Pick something you want to change.  Youre on the confidence forum so lets start there.Confidence is in part about being sure of an outcome and not afraid of failure.  Riding a bicycle is about confidence for example.  Im confident I wont fall off. Fear of failure causes a lack of confidence.  Because of that gaining confidence takes practice.  Much as you wouldnt start working out by benchpressing the entire stack at the gym with confidence you start small.  My friend said what helped him was starting small conversations with strangers  people at supermarket checkouts  asking them how their day is going and so on to get used to talking to new people.  Later at work hed once a week ask someone he worked with if they wanted to meet for lunch.  It didnt always work out but it wont always work out.  Gaining confidence is a lot like a computer game where you have infinite lives.  You get up again and carry on knowing more.  It gets less scary.  The scariest thing is taking the first step. TLDR Faking confidence is tough precisely because in knowing youre faking it you may feel like a fraud and generate a fear of being caught out which will affect your level of confidence.  Instead why not celebrate that every small effort is a victory to be built upon.  As a result youll probably walk a little taller and feel more confident.Good luck,confidence,cokrf2e,1,t5_2rmn5
3217920,0,t3_2waye6,Hey man. Women are sometimes like that in the US too. It seems like to me that you have what it takes. I dont know you personally but based on your text you are taking the necessary steps. I can relate because girls have flaked on me too. I am currently single and understand where you are coming from. It could be that you havent found the right girl yet. It just may take some persistence and some patience on your part. Please dont be discouraged. I just recently asked out a crush on valentines day and got denied because she had a boyfriend and I never knew. It does suck sometimes. At the same time there is that cliche There are more fish in the sea. Heck man there could be mermaids! Or even sirens lol. But in all seriousness dont give up yet. Or take a break and come back and try again. From one single guy to another Hang in there!  ,confidence,covjf5s,1,t5_2rmn5
3239167,0,t1_coxqp5g,Thank you so much for this. I have been mentally avoiding the physical exercise but do realise it is essential biologically to stimulate the production of feel good hormones. I think I just need to grow the fuck up for the last time in my life if that makes sense. I am glad you mentioned about chicks. Because not having a girlfriend is making people judge me in itself. I had a hard break up approximately  years ago and I feel no need to go through with a relationship again  not at this stage.,confidence,coxqvpz,1,t5_2rmn5

5407866,0,t3_3p3nir,Realize that the word creep is a subjectively momentary label and its not an actual thing someone can be. Its just the new way of saying fuck off really. You could be called a creep whether or not youre being a creep solely due to a lack of vocabulary possessed by this generation. Edit Basically if a girl finds you interestingattractive you have no worries. Although if she doesnt then she might call you a creep because shes too dense to come up with something other than creep. But dont start thinking that makes you a creep just understand that theres A LOT of dumb dumbs out there these days unable to verbalize their thoughts properly. ,confidence,cw2wyp4,5,t5_2rmn5

10023902,0,t1_db4ewp1,Agreed. I used to get oneitis BAD. Like I would sit around and wait until I found someone who I thought was the one. Then Id spend daysweeksmonths pining over them and planning how to approach and ask them out. Fantasizing about an amazing future together etc etc. Only to either get shot down or date for a bit it doesnt work out and I have a total meltdown because of it. It sucks and the whole thing is pathetic when you really think about it which makes you feel even shittier for being so cringy and obsessed in the first place.Now I just say fuck it and talk to whoever and flirt with anyone who I think is even remotely cute. Makes it so much easier especially if youve been flirting with like  or  different girls and you find out one has a boyfriend or just got engaged. Your like ah fuck...oh well it stings for like a split second but its like one girl off your list of  rather than losing The One forever.It also helps me stay out of my head because now sometimes Ill lose interest in a girl or shell stop flirting with me or whatever will happen. If youre busy doing other stuff and talking to other girls you dont overanalyze everything. One minute you guys were flirting then she kind of ghosts for a bit and then pops back up a few months later flirting again. From this perspective its just how things go sometimes maybe shell come back maybe not. With the oneitis though youd be racking your brain for months devastated that shes gone only to then overanalyze and obsess over why shes flirting with you again.,confidence,dbe54uv,1,t5_2rmn5
