2292447,0,t3_2li3dd,Velocity was too sharp it felt like I was watching really slow moving animations rather than parts of clips. Put some velocity on the cines you didnt. Dont put stuff over aspect ratio bars not sure why you did....,VideoGameEditing,clv29nh,1,t5_326ga

5695954,0,t3_3t35ki,Though Vegas is very much inferior to AE it is superior to Premiere in terms of video game editing. Premiere does not have the amount of control over the clips that you need to make edits. It simply isnt suitable for your the type of editing.You can try to be a pioneer though. If you use Premiere for the basic editing then im sure the style of the video will be a lot different from all the fluff we see now especially if you already have some design or videography knowledge.,VideoGameEditing,cx34ysl,2,t5_326ga
