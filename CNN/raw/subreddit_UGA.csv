21838,0,t3_1ucukn,You are all looking at it wrong. Grantham can stay the run defense is alright. The problem is with the secondary. Has been all year. Scott Lakatos is the secondary and defensive backs coach. His ass needs to be thrown out the bus a la Lane Kiffin before he does absolutely nothing next year with decent talent. But you might ask who we would fill the coaching position with? A...special teams coach. Unfortunately this may all make waaaay too much sense for this coaching staff which is why changes may need to be made if things dont start getting better going forward. ,UGA,cegx424,1,t5_2s4l0

The fact that they used a knockoff Star Wars theme but then the actual Superman theme? Come on. Dont even get me started on wondering why they had a Supermanlike character. Or why they had the shot of CMR so completely identical to the Stan Lee cameo in The Amazing SpiderMan.Cant forget about the scene towards the end where they pick up each others lightsabers for no reason and then the colors swap in the next shot. But finally why did they go with the kill me or save the girl cliche? Besides killing him would have stopped the choking and saved her anyway. The let the villain get away for no reason.Still the special effects were pretty good except when the sounds of matching didnt match their feet while they marched on Tate Plaza.

Also if he can take the SAT again and score higher on just one section and submit all scores to UGA they take the highest from each section.Although the GPA is amazing you have to meet a certain test score to be accepted early.

10567896,1,t1_dd5z8du,I dunno if you do  I think youre conflating understand with sympathize.One I totally do think OP was in no way in the wrong! They didnt know and nor did they deserve rudeness. They just asked for feedback on what was going on and I gave my take which was also a reaction to some of the other comments.Two and I wanna stress this theres a difference between understanding and sympathizing and I think understanding someones situation is important to how you go through the world. For example when I was younger and mostly just listened to my middleaged liberal parents I had a pretty negative view of religious conservatives. But as I grew older I spoke with people I disagreed with and started to understand why they thought the way they did. That didnt mean I had to accept it  it actually meant I could engage with it in a way that was more humane and probably more likely to change their mind.So a more recent example  Im really troubled by how a lot of people on the left have demonized white working class people who have pretty deeplyengrained racial biases. I think vital to engaging with people is trying to understand where theyre coming from  I dont think its right when white working class people say say racist things  but by trying to understand their situation I dont see it anymore as something thats immutable.Not trying to make excuses trying to explain in a way thats more productive and empathetic.,UGA,dd5zo4b,-1,t5_2s4l0

If you have specific questions feel free to ask me!This guy is right there are budget problems in Louisiana but that is mostly affecting instate residents and their tuition. What degree are you going for? That and obviously GPA and all that will affect your tuitionscholarships etc. At least from my experience LSU seems to be easier to secure funds for school and acceptance in the first place than UGA. I think weather is fairly similar though it rains a good bit more and it therefore more humid in LA. It almost never gets cold though so thats nice! And when you should visit depends on what you want to experience... If you want a normal day particularly at LSU they tailgate harder as much as I hate to say it definitely do NOT visit within  days of a football game. However if you want to experience the whole football thing do it! Try and get a ticket and be sure to get there a day ahead of time and stay in town. Commuting in will suck. Good luck!

Heres some constructive criticism for the website It would be better if the site also listed courses in a dropdown instead of forcing users to enter course details. I dont understand why the course search results are displayed in small boxes or why the extra info is hidden by a toggle shade. I get that you wanted it to look pretty by having background images for courses but most courses dont have those so users typically see a sea of red boxes that convey no information. A list maybe similar to how the front page of Reddit looks would be a much better way to convey course info. Or a table. Building on the previous point I cant quickly compare how different sections of a class fit into my current schedule. This is what made me hate building schedules using UGAs registration system and what made me love using Courseoff when I found it. Why are Browse and Schedule in different tabs?
