5321445,1,t3_3nwf9c,Are you really going to pay out of state tuition k per semester not including housingfoodliving expenses to play outdoors and drink? Finish your degree in Michigan and apply for teaching jobs at the charter schools here. Dont bury yourself in debt or worse squander your familys retirement money so you can have fun for  years.Dont squander your parents money either. k more than that after living expenses for a degree in teaching high school is a terrible financial decision.,NAU,cvrvkt7,-2,t5_2r5l4
5363367,0,t3_3ods38,Im currently a senior astronomy and physics student here at NAU. I personally love the program! There are a lot of research opportunities for undergrads which aids immensely in getting into grad school. The professors are very approachable allowing for good connections to be made. Its a great place for astronomy and I love it!,NAU,cvx8bg7,2,t5_2r5l4

6433375,0,t1_czk33tt,You dont know until its too late. Maybe youll get to class maybe youll never come home. You wont know. But people are optimistic in that sense and NAU is implying we think its safe enough for you to drive here. And we dont want the risk of being disadvantaged against our peers so we take the risk. And maybe it wont be our lives but it might be our safety and property i.e. the car.And we dont have too many days like this so this would be one out of two budgeted days. Done.,NAU,czkqz7f,2,t5_2r5l4

8601596,0,t3_4xl6rm,You are going to need to transfer those credits from your first college to NAU to have them reevaluated by NAU for credit a NAU. Whether or not your Community College accepted them for your AA is irrelevant to NAU as CCs have different accrediting bodies and therefore different guidelines regarding the requirements for conferring degrees. ,NAU,d6gskj4,3,t5_2r5l4
8723356,0,t3_4zgey1,Tons of people do drink AND smoke in the dorms. With alcohol dont be loud and obnoxious and you should be fine. Smoking is a little more risky but I smoked in my dorm every day last year just blowing it out fan in the window and using febreeze. Stay safe!,NAU,d6w272v,4,t5_2r5l4
8900444,0,t1_d77t1up,Seriously its been brutal.  I really like the new routes and think theyre the most efficient ones yet Ive been a bus driver at NAU for about  years now.  But the traffic is KILLING us bus only lanes would help us all out so so much. ,NAU,d7hpf18,2,t5_2r5l4

11404849,0,t1_dfopiak,Yup and housing capacity is somewhere around  of some bullshit like that. I had friends living on couches and paying full dorm pricing in some of the dorms. Notably South Village and Hilltop,NAU,dfoq44e,1,t5_2r5l4
