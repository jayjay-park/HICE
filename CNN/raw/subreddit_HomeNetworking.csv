Unsure about bandwidth caps with specific computers. Doesnt appear to be possible with my Netgear R. I dont think your current router does . at all but I could be wrong. It may have multiple antennae and radios i.e. MIMO but that doesnt mean .. Regardless all the routers listed will do both simultaneously so you can test which one works better they may force you to name the bands different things but it is still one network and youll be able to pick and choose. . has better penetration but the higher bandwidth . is often able to give you can give you a better usable range and signal strength esp. in environments with a lot of other devices on the . specturm. Really depends on your home however.  AC will help a tad as well. Again these esp. the Netgear Nighthawk and Asus RTAC are as good as it get with basic home networking equipment signal and range wise.

This might not be an issue for you but to some they dont want to leave their PC on all the time.A NAS box is a better long term idea which is basically a computer any pretty much that you dedicated entirely to the function of serving files and other stuff if you want.The free software freeNAS or NASforFree is a great way to have a very friendly and remotely controllable NAS box.Basically open up an old PC throw a bunch of HDDs inside and freeNAS onto it and you are good to go.A better setup uses ZFS as the file system and ECC memory to make sure the data is safe and corruption free.Naturally as you go down this list the cost increases so it really depends on how slick you want the setup to be and how important is your data if you dont have a redundant storage you dont really have protected data.Lastly there are a number of programs that allow you to do an automatic backup from your PC to the shared drive by schedule or whatever other method you want.

You can either manually split off the other pair blue and brown or people make splitter adapters for the purpose.However youll get much better performance from a gigabit switch  Mbits as opposed to .This BTW is why its almost always worth it to pull at least two pairs anywhere youre inclined to pull one.  The effort is the same and the extra cable cost is negligible.  Even if you only put a keystone jack on one and curl up the second pair behind the wall plateyoull have it when you want it.I disagree with ucobb.  CATA is too much of a price premium right now but CAT is barely more expensive than CATe and probably worth using if its greater thickness is not a problem.  But pulling cable through walls is a huge PITA you dont want to start that unless you have to.Note that CATe is not guaranteed to run gigabit but usually does if the lengths are below  m ft.

2732894,0,t1_cnentwc,Link aggregation via two motherboard ports is a big maybe.  Its definitely not a builtin feature.  I cant think of any reason you couldnt do it in software which usually means someone has done it in software but I havent personally seen a link aggregation module for windows.  I have however seen addon NICs that have two to four ethernet ports and support link aggregation on the card itself.  A brief Google search popped up an article on how to do it in Linux that also goes into the limitations and talks about what it really is and what it is not.Link aggregation on an enduser PC vs a server might not do what you think it does.  It would be a great addition to a NAS but in general link aggregation does not simply double the bandwidth of the wire to that machine.  If  you have aggregated gigabit Ethernet and you connect through a switch that supports aggregation to a server that supports aggregation you get the same speed as if you used one line.  HOWEVER you can then go and start a second transfer tofrom that server or to some other machine on top of the first one.  I forget why the limitation is there but it is.Link aggregation is great between switches because it prevents one user from grabbing the whole line.  Also good between switches and servers for the same reason.  It allows more people to use the server for heavy transfers without any slowdowns but does not allow each of those transfers to go faster.  One person pulling from a server with x link aggregation would get MBs.  Three people doing it would all get MBs.  Six people doing it would all get MBs.About SNMP... I think you took what I said as a description of what you would actually do to monitor your network.  I was just describing how the protocol works.  All that stuff is handled by software with a nice web GUI for navigating and managing settings.  The send the OID and community string to the SNMP port and retrieve the value is what that software is doing under the hood to produce the nice pretty graphs you see on the web interface.What you do is enable SNMP on anything you want to monitor ddwrt adds SNMP capability to your router if it doesnt have it and set the community string its a password they just dont want to call it that the same.  The default is the word public but I dont like default passwords.Step  is to choose a machine to run a monitoring client and install a web server with PHP and MySQL support on it.  I use a Raspberry Pi but an alwayson PC is better Step  is to install some kind of monitoring software.  I use a program called Cacti which tries to be very selfcontained.  It has instructions that are easy to find and fairly straightforward.  There are plenty of options for monitoring some probably newer than Cacti.  Most of them have presets for this or that type of device so youd probably just tell Cacti to monitor a new device of type Switch and it would probably figure it all out.  Works well for routers I havent had a managed switch to try it on.Once thats done you just point your browser at  and it shows you a navigable web page with graphs of your stuff.  A switch with SNMP support will give you an inboundoutbound traffic graph for every port which is great for knowing what other device is responsible for your Netflix suddenly turning into legos.Its not a oneclickdone thing for sure.  Takes an afternoon to set up but once its set up it just does its thing.  You add a browser bookmark for the graphs page and pull it up whenever you need it.,HomeNetworking,cnepvhv,2,t5_2s4pd

If you want the end device to be oblivious of the change of AP then you need to use the same details all around including channel.You can still set up the APs on different channels and have the end device switch from one AP to the next just fine naturally without the ZeroHandoff technology.If I am not mistaken in this second more traditional approach its the end device that decides when to leave an AP the controller can only tell the AP not to associate with the device to leave it on the current AP.While in the end a similar result is achieved the time laps between change of APs is different and who and how the choice is made is different.ampnsbpEdit Ubiquiti answer on the topic,HomeNetworking,cqh1e05,1,t5_2s4pd

Be mindful of obstructing materials for wireless like walls concrete metal etc. You can setup what you think will cover and use a wifi analyzer on your phone to measure signal strength. Use exactly the same SSID and passwordencryption settings on all of your access points for seamless roaming. .GHz has a longer range but not many channels that dont overlap while GHz has a shorter range with many channels that dont overlap.

4153660,0,t1_crtftt4,Second this. Wired connections may not be as difficult and complicated as you might think though OP. Im in the same situation as you but my .ghz network worked fine for several months after moving in. It randomly slowed to a snails pace and through the help of others on this subreddit I deduced it was due to an increase in interference. I looked for solutions that didnt involve wifi or running wire and happened upon powerline adapters. Theyve been a GODSEND. They transmit the internet signal across the electrical lines in your apartment. Plug one into an outlet and connect via ethernet to your router. Plug any others into an outlet by your computersother devices and connect them via ethernet as well. BAM speeds as good as if you were wired directly to the modem itself. . for a set on Amazon TPLINK or LEA Networks and they are literally plug amp play. You can have up to something like  in a network and you only need  to transmit the signal the rest can act as receivers. Of course that only solves the problem for your pcs not older random devices like tablets and cell phones. I think though if your .ghz devices are having trouble connecting in the next room over a bridge isnt going to help matters. I would say move the router to a more central location and thats the best you can do. If you have laptops that are .ghz only you could set up powerline adapters in stationary locations such as desks that they are commonly used at. Here are a couple of crappy Paint images I made to show how you can move your router to a more central location and connect your desktops to it via ethernet using powerline adapters aloneWhat I imagine your apartment to be currentlyWhat it could beThis is possible because you can have multiple powerline networks working separately over the same electrical lines. You can make one network so you can move the access point away from the modem and into a more central location and a second network to connect your desktops and other devices to the access point.

4180478,0,t3_37j6yq,I just tried a suggestion to change current hardware NAT status to off on the Archer. Now it works fine!

I also tried setting the Roku as DMZ host which didnt do anything. But with just the currnet hardware NAT status off setting I am currently able to stream perfectly. I guess that was the fix. I just streamed  movies with no issues. I can also see from my server that the bandwidth use with Plex is much more efficient now requiring less upload from my server than before.Before when it was still working not getting slow speeds my server would constantly be streaming at top speed.

Some people like one over the other for their own reasons.

4817247,0,t1_cu1lsth,Yes all of those are routers. In order to get out to the internet youll need a router regardless. Firewalls and UTM devices all have routers built in to them as well so routing between VLANs wont be an issue for you. You can also use a layer  switch which would actually give better network performance. In all cases you can still block access through ACLs.Another thing to note since it is a coffee shop if adding internet access for customers that will be another VLAN that you want completely isolated from the rest of the network. Not that it changes what equipment you need.As far as your routerUTM device like what was posted in your thread on homelab a UTM is a fairly generic term. What specifically are you looking for with the UTM? My Mikrotik router has pretty advanced firewall rules that I can configure. For content filtering you can always just configure openDNS. For IPSIDS I would have to stream packets to a server running something like Snort. If you arent to savvy with this stuff though Ubiquiti and Mikrotik probably arent what you are looking for. They are more of a support yourself solution. I am not too familiar with the Sonic Wall or Merakai stuff but they would of course come in at the higher end of the budget but they will have some vendor support available with all of the features you are looking for ready out of the box with configuration of course. pfsense might be a good lower budget alternative if you want a mix of supporting on your own and vendor support.,HomeNetworking,cu1r4sn,2,t5_2s4pd

5039922,0,t1_cur18q2,Well Im an idiot.  Those cables did not fit into the phone jacks which were mislabeled and showing all of them were two phone lines per jack.  Out of  jacks only one jack was dual line and none were RJ I think they were RJ. The phone numbers were all wrong too only  were correct the rest I had to figure out. Also half the office was wired cate and the phones worked but the other half was wired some other way RJ for a Panasonic phone system and the phones did not power up. I spent a good deal of time just sorting everything out and now I have to go back and figure out how to get the panasonic wired phone jacks wired to work with Avaya.    It was fun to make the cable but ultimately useless to me.

5312814,0,t3_3nro27,its the subnet mask just a string of s. means the string is characters long filled with just s. of these make up  byte and  a IPv adress consists of  bits aka  bytes.it is called subnetmask because if you take an ipvadress and translate it into binary in one row and put the subnet mask in binary beneath it you can easily see what the ID of the subnet isfor example  ...would translate to     ...    IP     ...     Maskwhenever packages travel through the internet they should reach a destination the destination is usually a pc in a network the network is identified by the subnet mask and everything beyond the subnet mask up to the nd bit are so called adressbits or hostarea and identify devices in the network.in an  subnet you still have  bit left which you can use to assign adresses to devices in this network.since we work in binary this means  combinations of s and s are possible.HOWEVER since one adress is already used to identify the subnet . and another one is usedto adress all devices in the subnet at the same time .  so called broadcast.you only have  combinations of s and s left to build adresses.filling up your subnet would then look like this     ...    IP  first device  subnet      ...    Mask     ...    IP  second device subnet      ...    Mask       ...    IP   third device  in subnet      ...    Mask      ...    IP   th device  in subnet      ...    Mask   if youd fill up even the last bit youd reach the broadcastadress of this subnet which is offlimits for devices.if you know how bitincrementation works you can imagine what happens when you add another  to .the last byte would reset to  and the added bit would be carried over to the second byte     ...    IP       ...    Mask as you can see suddenly we changed a  bit which is in the subnetarea which tells the router where it needs to forward its package to.you can then add another  to this adress and it would mean the first device of subnet      ...    IP first device  in subnet       ...    Mask subnet mask and ipadress of a package are compared with a logical AND behind the scenes.      AND         AND         AND         AND   through that comparison the router knows the subnetIDthat is why the hostarea of the subnetmask only consists of s and there are no s inbetween the shope this helps. ,HomeNetworking,cvqrvwc,37,t5_2s4pd

5375928,0,t3_3ondnw,I have a similar setup to what youre doing with a TPLINK Archer C acting solely as an access point. You should be using a LAN port on your main router connected to a LAN port on the AP. Set a static IP outside of your DHCP scope on the AP LAN settings clients will then use the DHCP server provided by your router. In addition to turning off the DHCP on the AP I also turn off any NAT UPnP QoS etc. services on the access point.More info on the equipment youre using may be helpful in troubleshooting.Edit I see youre using a straight access point so a lot of what I wrote doesnt apply. You should be able to put it in Access Point mode disable DHCP set a static IP and be good to go. Cabling is a good place to start.

See if you have a default static route  something like ... ... fastethernet.

6303356,0,t1_cz640eu,Anything you expose as indicated is subject to attack.  How you mitigate it is by customizing and being unique in your planning.If you arrive in my network and then your machine starts having scans against IT wouldnt you leave?  If bots got in but couldnt get back out whilst in isnt that a good method to avoid your connection.If you wanted to get creative you could use port knocking and leverage some custom iptable scripts on your internal hosts like plex.Using random and complex usernames and passwords can protect you from the most malicious attackers.Learning to build your defenses using a system like pfSense gives you unprecedented access to complex systems in a very intuitive manner.  As you learn about the concepts the wizards and guides are more than enough to build what you want.Ensure you can port forward  end to end in a reverse proxy setup enforcing strict firewall and NAT rules i.e. source IP only allowed to see plex.hostname.com and not plex.hostname.comweb for everything inside.Allow ping and other traffic from source IPs.Rejectdeny learn ipchainsiptablesEach device exposed in any form on the internet should have strict policies in place from the way you access to the access credentials.If you decide on openVPN then make sure youre setting the firewall rules properly and yes there might be a little overhead but setting your plex and other stuff to stream at a reasonable rate itll be completely secure.You can even schedule natfirewall rules so while youre away have it run through profiles.Just throwing ideas out there. ,HomeNetworking,cz64cuo,1,t5_2s4pd

You need to be able to trust that your system will come online after every power failure and that it can reset reliably if something crashes. If you trust your current router and are comfortable configuring it Id say its a reasonable choice. Looking at this link not Tomato but still OpenVPN it seems the E should be just about capable of saturating your WAN connection over VPN. That said it might be worthwhile doing some testing before you leave. Try connecting your phone to the VPN for a few days to see whether the connection is reliable evaluate RDP performance and maybe even download some torrents over VPN as a stress test. If everything performs reliably it wont be fast at  Mbps obviously Id say stick with your current setup.

6458788,0,t1_czndgxd,gt How can I know if my device is leaking DNS queries? Does that only happen if the connection to the VPN is lost? Ive used those software VPNs before and sometimes the connection randomly drops without me noticing it. The connection seems more stable when I connect directly through the device with the VPN server IP and the username and password. Can there still be DNS leakage even if the connection is stable?gt Windows has a habit of sending DNS Queries to the server configured on your network adaptor which in the case of the company guest network may be able to see them.ampnbsp    The IPv problem is caused when the host network supports IPv and the VPN doesnt windows and probably most other OSs will see that it has an IPv connection available and try to use it for V traffic unless your VPN software explicitly blocks it or you disable IPv support on your network adaptor there is a possibility that if the destination is V enabled you end up sending the traffic directly over the network other than the VPN.ampnbsp  Re the firmware issue unless you have something incredibly sensitive on your router or expect to be the target of an attack I wouldnt worry about it to much.  Unless there is a major vulnerability in the VPN software under active attack by bots its unlikely anyone will goto the hassle of hacking a home VPN.

You can try a Ubiquiti EdgerouterLite or a Mikrotik RBUiAS. They both do QoS routing firewall various IP services for around . The new Mikrotik RBUiAS is more powerful but costs more  and the desktop model is not released yet. Then you can match it with a wireless access point such as a UniFi AP Pro  DualBand bgn or the new UniFi AC Pro  dualband bgnac or even the cheap UniFi AClite  less antennas than the pro but about the sameIf you need the all in one package the RBUiASHnDINCRSGSHnDIN is the pretty much the same as the RBUiAS but with integrated .Ghz Wifi.

Generally keep in mind that the available throughput for a single connection wont increase. If your line rate is Gbps per cable you would now be able to have up to two connections each at Gbps you would not be able to have one connection at Gbps since most LACP implementations do not send half the packets out of one port and half through the other but simply load balance a connection on one port with available bandwidth.With that in mind think if you really would benefit from that because it would require you to have simultaneous transfers at line rate before you see any benefit.,HomeNetworking,d2kdx9g,2,t5_2s4pd

Alternately you could use that second router to isolate the rest of your LAN and have the Pi sitting in a DMZ network.  Double NATing isnt ideal if you have services running on the LAN though.Secondly  some routers allow you to set a second LAN IP on it. Set a second LAN IP on your GW to something other than your LAN subnet and have the Pi on the same subnet as that.Failing that firewall rules on either the Pi problematic if others have admin access to it or the LAN devices to block access to the Pi IP.,HomeNetworking,d79vnqm,3,t5_2s4pd

The most likely cause of a security breach would be hitting a product which is insecure and then being able to jump onto other hosts etc. The router itself properly configured is very secure. Putting VMs on different VLANs would prevent an intruder breaking out on one VM easily getting onto another VM as itd be firewalled off on your router. So theyd have to get past that firewall which is as hard as getting past your public firewall if you set it correctly.gt Right now I am running Proxmox in a VM just for a VPN temporarily used it as a router but basically just as a proof of concept my server is power hungry and I dont want it always on  could this be used to properly achieve this?Im not familiar enough with ProxMox to say but Id be amazed if you couldnt use VLANs on the virtual interfaces assigned to your VMs in it.gt Sorry  I am kind of rabbit trailing a bit here now if you dont mind following it with me a bit. If the main router being used for both IPs and networks is a common point of failure would using two routers fix this problem?Not really if theyre the same hardware theres the same chance as both being compromised as one if you have them set up with the same degree of care with regards to the security youve applied to them.gt Or at that point is the shared modem still an issue? Modem almost certainly not an issue.gt I wouldnt spend money on a second router for this its not worth it for me but I am curious for the sake of learning. What I would do if this made sense would be take one line from port  on my modem to a switch for my internal network then port  from my modem to NIC  on my server and run pfSense in a VM as a router for my external services. I dont know if that makes sense though.Sounds like a lot of work but obviously that stuff behind pfSense would technically be more secure. Unnecessary though. You could say the same if you then put a Sophos appliance behind the pfSense  things behind that are even more secure. And again if you put a Palo Alto firewall behind that Sophos  even more secure... Really an ERX properly configured is fine. You dont need half a dozen devices one after the other.Im pretty security minded and I just have my ERL at my perimeter.

Phone only needs  pair wires to work so if they were lazy they may have only connected  pair.  You need to check the ends behind your wall plates to see if all the wires are connected to the keystones properly.  If not you will need to fix that.  For coax all you need to do is make sure the active line gets to that box for the modem.  If you dont have any TVs or other things remove the splitter and attach your modem directly to the incoming line.  Youll need to figure out which one that is.

9337683,0,t3_58b3rk,Im sorry if this comes across as offering a bunch of info you already know  Im not writing it just for you but for anyone else who ends up here looking for help in the future.What  of people call a router is really three things in one a router which moves information between two different networks your internal network and the Internet in most cases a switch allowing different devices on your internal network to talk to each other and a WiFi access point allowing devices to connect wirelessly to your internal network.Depending on the quality of the software that your wireless router uses these three different functions may or may not be easily separated. Good software will make them completely independent I have routers that have served as routers as access points as switches and even as wireless bridges about which more later. I am personally biased toward tomato because Ive been using it forever eight years so far and know its ins and outs but others may be even better depending on the device and the firmware.What most people here recommend is separating these roles so that only one device covers each role.So my provider uses fiber and at their demarcation point i.e. when their wires touch my wires there are three plugs. One carries phone one carries gigabit Ethernet one connects to their video system I dont use it so cant tell you about that one but assume its an RG coax cable. The phone is obviously plugged into the phone system of the house. The Ethernet runs to a jack inside the house.Inside that Ethernet is connected to the WAN plug of a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite. Its just a router and it doesnt even have a designated WAN widearea network port it can treat any of its three ports that way because its a router that routes traffic between networks. One of its ports is designated as a LAN localarea network port by me. That port is plugged via a standard patch cable into a port switch.The port switch is connected to all of the ports that the people who built the house installed  of them plus six ports that I had installed to run down to the media center area plus all devices located in the network closet right now thats the uplink to the main network and the wireless access point located right there.From this point wires run to various points in the house. Like I said twelve drops. In addition to the one access point located in the main network closet I have one in an upstairs bedroom that serves as my gaming room and one in the downstairs master bedroom. As I mentioned before the ability to use a standard consumer wireless router as an access point is mostly determined by the software capabilities. Two of the three are Asus RTACUs running Shibbys tomato which means theyre pretty good devices running very good software. Turn off the DHCP server assign an IP and tell it its an access point  all on the basic setup page of tomato. Although what this assumes as basic is basic  only if youve set up networks before  Im no pro by any means but Ive done this for over  years at home. One is a TPLink Archer C which I only bought because it was cheap and on Amazon Prime if I had it to do over Id have bought another RTACU and not bothered with saving  but its adequate.So get something to be a router in the room where the modem is located. And put something capable of being a switch in there. This could be one device or it could be two. Run wires to the places you want to have network connectivity. Do not use wireless for gaming you might get lucky but its usually not worth the bet. The wires should end in a patch panel in your network closet next to the modem and in keystone jacks look them up theyre great in the rooms youre connecting. Unless the house is a lot bigger than it looks one wireless access point should suffice for the whole thing. If one isnt enough get three one on channel  one on channel  and one on channel  at each vertex of the house. Yes I believe in overkill. Wire them all together. Let the one next to the modem be the router or just get a separate router like I did.Wow wrote a whole lot here. Hope its coherent. Happy to help with questions.EDIT also wireless bridge? Promised Id write more later. So a wireless bridge is what happens when you have a wired device somewhere out there that needs to connect to Ethernet  but theres no Ethernet available! You connect that wireless device to a wireless router that is set to wireless bridge mode. It connects to another access point but instead of extending the wireless service as a wireless extender would do it just provides the service to the Ethernet ports that are part of its switch. For example I have a device that controls some stuff on my pool. It needs to have Ethernet.It is plugged into an old Buffalo WHRG running tomato configured as a wireless client bridge. The Buffalo connects to one of the Asus RTACUs as a client and it just allows anything plugged into its Ethernet ports to pretend that theyre on the same network as my wired computers.,HomeNetworking,d8zmbpw,1,t5_2s4pd

9791346,0,t3_5fg5zv,First off you said you see two linksys networks.  Did you actually change the default WiFi name and setup security properly on your Linksys?  I would suggest that you factory reset your router and then make sure you configure your WiFi with a good password using WPA AESCCMP.  Make sure you also disable WPS.  If you left things open someone could simply be leaching your bandwidth and slowing you down.  Do that first and see if your speeds go back to normal.  Also make sure that when you setup your router again that you do not enable QoS of any kind.  ampnbspGetting  Mbps over . GHz is actually pretty good unless you live in the middle of nowhere so assuming you dont I wouldnt be too concerned if you get slow speeds on that band.  On wired you should get the speeds you pay for if no one else is downloading at the same time.   GHz can also deliver your rated speed but you need to be relatively close to your router as it doesnt go as far.  ,HomeNetworking,dajzvlt,2,t5_2s4pd

Also some routers have Ethernet ports that can be configured either as routed ports or as switched ports. These configuration choices can also adversely affect throughput depending on the router model. Also the type of traffic and the firmware level can have a dramatic affect on throughput. Merely being equipped with Ethernet ports is no indication of actual throughput. Additionally just because a router can route and switch packets at wire speed is no guarantee that it can do so under all operating conditions.,HomeNetworking,daw1102,1,t5_2s4pd

If you have WPA enabled then its a completely moot point and you shouldnt worry about it.MAC filtering on WiFi is like hiding the SSID its a dangerous option because people think it provides even a small measure of security when really it doesnt. That might be why Netgear stripped it out of the firmware that ended up on there.Edit to add ISPs retain the rights to flash firmware onto the modems connected to their network basically. One of the many reasons its better to have a separated modem and router.

If everything was at  FPS Id recommend you knock everything down but those settings look fine.VLANs are great they do serve a purpose but I wouldnt configure them right away unless you really want to or you really want to learn. We had a very small remote office that had about  users they worked off of a local server. At some point we added IP cameras to that office about  of them warehouse connected to a small office. All  cameras were IP cameras and they lived on the same LAN as the users and file server. We never had network issues. Whenever I transferred files it seemed to be just as fast as before the cameras were added. I dont have any bandwidth tests to prove that but I didnt get that feeling of this should be going faster than it is because it seemed as if everything were working as it should. Today we have put the cameras on their own VLAN but it ran wo VLANs for about . years.What I recommend is that you get the server and IP cameras on the same switch and confirm everything is operating in Full Duplex at the proper speed cameras probably at  as gigabit is not common on cameras yet but there are gigabit cameras...sure and the connection from the switch to the server should  be gigabit since it is taking in all the camera feeds.,HomeNetworking,dbia6cl,2,t5_2s4pd

10074230,0,t1_dbkapuw,I agree with most of this but I think there are additional considerations. Ubiquiti gear has a solid reputation and you can expect it to last longer than the typical consumer routers. Purchasing the Unifi AP AC Pro may provide you with a touch more future proofing as more devices start to use three streams. The question you start to ask yourself is how long do I plan to keep this equipment in use?Another factor that I feel is not mentioned frequently when comparing these devices is POE standard. The UAP AC Pro uses the .af standard of POE. The UAP AC Lite uses V passive POE. The V passive POE is not as common. This means you will need to use the provided POE injector or purchase a POE switch capable of V passive POE which tends to be more expensive. There is nothing wrong with the POE injector Ubiquiti provides. Its actually quite nice for a POE injector. However if you are installing more than one access point or are thinking about installing POE powered cameras down the line there is an advantage to using a POE switch to power all the devices. If you are planning to use a UPS as backup power to your network hardware it means plugging in only one switch vs X injectors. If I recall correctly Ubiquiti has said they are moving away from the V passive POE powered devices to those using the .afat standards. Their products currently in beta are using the .at standard.If cost isnt the primarylimiting factor you may want to check out the upcoming Unifi AC HD. It still hasnt been released for sale in the beta store but the specs look awesome. You have to sign up for Ubiquitis beta program to access the beta store. However if the inwall AP release is anything to go by it will sell out very fast.These are some of the factors that you should consider when making your decision.The EdgeRouter Lite is a great router. I would also recommend the Unifi Security Gateway USG as another option. The edgrouter OS is very powerful but the Unifi Controller interface is very nice and is probably easier to transition if coming from a more typical consumer router firmware or even ddwrt.

10411059,0,t3_5p3jta,What you want is called a wireless bridge.  Some consumer routers support this feature and call it media bridge.  If your repeater is configured as a client bridge with the repeater function turned off then that is exactly what you already have.  The only difference would be if a new bridge had better WiFi then your current one and your router supported it as well.Powerline by default does exactly what you describe just really poorly.  Are you sure both places are on the same circuit?  Being on the same circuit is not required but it does help a lot.  Since I assume by your ISP being Charter that you are in the US the bigger thing that you need to worry about is crossing phases.  A phase cross will often completely kill powerline or at the very least make it really slow.  In the US you have a  chance of a phase cross if you are not on the same circuit.  However given the relative small sizes of US branch circuits if you are on the same circuit then you devices are probably close.  In that case WiFi will do far better unless there is something that blocks wireless in the way.  If you dont already have a good AC router then investing in upgrading that and your bridge will be money far better spent then on powerline.  ,HomeNetworking,dco5t91,2,t5_2s4pd

Basically U can only be set for one vlan per port.  Only one untagged vlan also known as the native vlan this is different than the pvid but well skip that discussion right this second.So you want to add a T to your connected port for the router and a U to the connected port for the device.  Unless the device is going to tag the traffic itself in which case it needs to be vlan aware and be configured correctly for it.... But Im getting ahead of myself.Traffic will go from the untagged port into vlan  and when the switch egresses the traffic to the router it will add a .q tag when sending the traffic to your router allowing your router to handle the traffic correctly.Let me know if youre unsure on anything Ive put here.

Simply connect other network devices to the switch as normal and the switch will detect whether they are PoEcompatible and enable power automatically. The one is to use a midspan or PoE injector to add PoE capabilities to regular nonPoE network links. Midspan can be used to upgrade existing LAN installations to PoE and provide a versatile solution where fewer PoE ports are required. ,HomeNetworking,deebp47,1,t5_2s4pd

11148827,0,t3_5z5rza,Good job planning ahead or at least trying to. I recently went through something like this on a new house build. Biggest difference is that we really only use video in one space. Nonetheless I do have some suggestions you may appreciate. For perspective we have  bedrooms a big common space kitchen and study plus an attached guest apartment. Main goal for us was fast hard wired networking audio distribution and as future proof as we could reasonably do. We ran  Cat ethernet drops from a centrally located media closet to each bedroom all around the study into the master bathroom garage and mechanical room. We also ran  zones worth of speaker cable back to the same closet. This closet holds a modem router WAP NAS which serves as our media server a mac mini which is our main audio player and an HTD Lynx whole house audio system. There is a parallel home theater system in the common room which can serve as a source or player for anything running on the HTD system. An Apple TV plays video from the NAS onto the home theater zone. My thoughts I wanted hard wired ethernet and hard wired audio. I feel this gives a more robust connection higher speed for the networking and more downstream options for the audio. We ran lots of extra ethernet and we put conduit between places that we thought might help later like the home theater space and the media closet. Having retrofit wires in several other houses I know it is way easier to run cable before sheetrock. Related to the previous point I ran Cat so it would all be useful for longer. We dont need all the speed now but the price difference was small compared to the work to install or worse retrofit.The Apple TV we use was inexpensive to buy used is small and easy to use and makes playing content from any of our other Apple devices easy. We play ours through a projector but these could easily work for your TV sources.,HomeNetworking,devphbc,5,t5_2s4pd

11296201,0,t1_dfc6qoi,Yes I think thats it. Whats the best way to go about it? As far as I can see my two options areA Add single forward lookup zone on my DC for mydomain.com. Add A records in there with the private IPs of my webservers eg website.mydomain.com and website.mydomain.com. And also add a blank A record pointing to the public IP for my namecheap webhosting so that mydomain.com resolves correctly.B Add a new forward lookup zone for each website so for example Id have a zone for website.mydomain.com and another for website.mydomain.com. Each zone would just have a blank A record pointing to the private IP of the relevant web server. This would avoid mydomain.com being resolved on my internal DNS at all but means Id end up with more forward lookup zones.Im not sure whats best practice on Windows. Both have the desired result but Im a little concerned that A might cause issues with AD. Will requests for lab.mydomain.com first get queried against the mydomain.com forward lookup zone? Or do they immediately query against lab.mydomain.com?Basically does it go from most specific to least specific when selecting a forward lookup zone? Or the other way around?

An extender is a device which uses the same WiFi network it is extending for clients to talk back the main router.  Because WiFi is half duplex the extender can only talk to the client OR the main router but not both a the same time.  This makes them very slow.  If the device uses Ethernet a separate WiFi network or in this case MoCA to talk to the main router it is an AP access point.  If you want to use MoCA to connect APs then this is the best option gt I read that Orbi uses star topology and therefore the base station must be used to send out information and thus must be centralized and that its range is inferior to Velops which is a true mesh network.This is true but only to a point.  Orbi is a star based system and not a true mesh.  It cannot multi hop away from the base station.  However Orbis backhaul link is twice as fast x vs x of Velops.  This means the satellite nodes can be further away while maintaining the same speed or faster if closer.  Basically if you are not out of range of a single hop Orbi will be faster.  Unless you have a mansion it is unlikely that the range of Orbi will be an issue.  Mesh is for large range at the expense of speed Orbi is a compromise of range while not sacrificing speed.  Also Velop has been shown to sometimes do extremely dumb things like use . GHz for backhaul which is terrible for performance.  Orbi always dedicates its fastest network connection to backhaul.gt I have also read here that most mesh devices are line of site multi hop multi drop and with a very large area to cover I am still struggling with figuring out which option to choose.How large is very large area?  If you can provide some details as to the size and construction of your house we can advise which might be better but that is almost always Orbi.From the summary of the link you provided gt I have to say NETGEARs right. Orbi simply blows away its mesh competitionTake a look here at a later review from the same site.

Dont futz with new router in AP mode. Thats just asking for more work. Also mesh systems are expensive and while they do serve some people really well I dont think you need that for what seems like a pretty straightforward use case.Get a Ubiquiti UAPACLITE put it in that adjacent room. Set it with the same SSID as the upstairs router but on a different channel and turn down the power until its just good enough to get the job done downstairs. Done and done.Alternatively if the only thing separating you from the other room where theres a connection is just a simple interior x wall dont be afraid to explore running ethernet thru it. Its quite simple. The only catch would be if neither the switch in the adjacent room or your PC in the office are close to said wall. Then youll have an exposed ethernet cable running along the baseboard in those rooms.

11599638,0,t1_dgatprd,Youre thinking of WAN to LAN speed but any recent gigabit consumer router will do that just fine.LAN to LAN speed literally any gigabit router will do that at line speed without any trouble as its just a basic switch and doesnt pass traffic through any routing or inspection at all.,HomeNetworking,dgatszx,3,t5_2s4pd
11602622,0,t1_dgb39nu,A dslam is the unit the ISP injects the internet signal  frequency portion into the copper lines.  This is why if you want to use a copper line phone with your dsl that you have to use low pass filter. The location of this is called a CO. Central Office.  It connects all the houses and businesses within two to  miles with copper. DSL itself usually doesnt do well past  feet. The fact you were getting mb single loop is pretty incredible. ,HomeNetworking,dgb603u,1,t5_2s4pd
11618375,0,t3_65sfkq,A couple things raspberry Pis arent that great for APs for more than one device at a time in my experience. Secondly if you still want to try it you want to create your own ad hoc network on the wireless interface and bridge it to the eth interface then log in to eduroam on the pi.So as far as eduroam is concerned your school has to be using a local Network Access Control device like NetworkSentry  a lot of them have NAT detection and will take your device off the network and isolate it anyways so you may not have much success. Good luck,HomeNetworking,dgcybyr,1,t5_2s4pd
11627158,0,t1_dgdy2s5,A wireless bridge takes a wireless signal from a normal routerAP and makes it wired.  You dont need anything special on the source router but you want it to be AC or at least a good  GHz N one.  AC WiFi is almost always far faster and more reliable than powerline.For the bridge you just need a router that supports bridge mode.  It is often called media bridge.  Many Asus models support it.  Take a look at the RTAC or RTAC.,HomeNetworking,dgdy8g9,2,t5_2s4pd

11650786,0,t3_660ou2,Each wire in the Category cables are the same. The difference is their wiring method.You can make the cable according T A on on end of the cable and T B on the opposite end. Also you can make the cable according according T A on both ends or  T B on both ends. Both of these two method will work well.The colors in T A and T B are just used for classify and test I think. So that you can check the wiring error if the cable doesnt work.,HomeNetworking,dggmpqs,1,t5_2s4pd

11730233,0,t1_dgpm1n2,gt the lowest possible AC link speed MbpsThe lowest AC Link speed is  Mbps or   MHz stream.  That is how you get AC routers with less than  Mbps rating.   Mbps is two  MHz streams. gt Wave  features like MUMIMOBecause almost nothing supports them yet.  Your link speeds with the devices you have now will be exactly the same between an ACLITE and a fancy MUMIMO router with a huge ACXXXX rating.  In fact you can usually get better total speeds with multiple ACLITEs.  Compare to the ACHD at .  Unless you actually have clients that support MUMIMO or more than two streams it does nothing for you.  You could get two ACLITEs for  and split the load and get more real world bandwidth.  There are few devices like Macbook Pros that support  streams but that is still covered by the ACPRO for far less money.  Almost nothing supports MUMIMO on the client side yet.Wait until your normal upgrade cycle nets you devices with MUMIMO support then upgrade.  By then MUMIMO routersAPs will be much cheaper.  ,HomeNetworking,dgpnhwl,2,t5_2s4pd

11779710,0,t1_dgv8eb3,gt The MoCA adapter will take the Ethernet signal and turn it into coax that will feed into the cable box for the express purpose of providing the data for VoD and the Guide and whatnot.Thats what I figured.gt People have been using the Actiontec router as a passive bridgeMoCA convertor for a decade.I dont doubt that at all. As I expected the MoCA stuff is just a replacement for an ethernet cable similar to powerline adaptors. Thats not the part I was worried about at all. I dont know how Verizon does their TV so you need to figure that out first but I wouldnt just assume any old router would work. For one its very likely that they use multicast so you need a router that has a built in IGMP proxy not every routers has that and even if it has they are often quite shitty. Now my ISP keeps IPTV and Internet on separate VLANs on the WAN side if your ISP also does that which is likely you need a router that has VLAN support. Next my ISP requires me to set a static route for a specific IP range so it goes to the IPTV VLAN a lot of consumergrade routers dont offer that functionality either. The MoCA stuff is a nonissue its the higherlevel IPIGMP stuff you should worry about. ,HomeNetworking,dgv9n9j,1,t5_2s4pd
