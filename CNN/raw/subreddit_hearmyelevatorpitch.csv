3398172,0,t3_2z4lmb,Surveys are already a hard sell. Notice how many retail chains have surveys at the bottom of the printout receipts baiting a possibility to win a big money gift card? Id guess their conversion rates are pretty low even with the money offers. On your site Id suggest including either a video showing your most fun survey to date update as needed or just link to a demo survey. To sell surveys as fun IMO youll need to prove it with an example before asking people to sign up or rather expecting them to blindly sign up.,hearmyelevatorpitch,cpfm8xz,2,t5_37dx9
