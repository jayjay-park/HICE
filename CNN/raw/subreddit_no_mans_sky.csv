8589674,0,t3_4xg6z3,Well I for one love the game. People seemed to have had a very big misconception of what this game was about. Much of the game is about economics resources mining upgrading etc.While exploring and whatnot is certainly a very cool aspect of the game seriously Ive yet to find a planet that really looks similar to another and it really hasnt gotten old approaching a new planet and seeing the brand new environment I dont think thats the main premise of it and if youre simply just looking to explore new areas it might not be for you because there isnt a whole lot to do on each individual planets other than gather resources and knowledge. ,no_mans_sky,d6farga,1,t5_2zcmw

8626693,0,t3_4y0g2e,Im obsessed with ships. Im currently flying in a  slot I guess you could call it one of the explorer versions as its not a fighter or large enough that Id call it a cargo ship. This is my th ship. Its very VERY hard to find a crashed ship that has more than  slots over what you already have but I HAD found that it was easier to keep finding crashed ships fixing them and moving on to the next. NOW as of yesterday Ive figured out this is just my opinion that its easier for me to mine a lot of one mineral like Emerli or even Gold stock up as much as I can in my exosuit and ship and then go to the space station and try and find someone who will pay high dollar for it. When youre selling stuff sometimes there will be a little gold star in on the right side of the item to indicate its a high value item good for selling not great for buying. If you wait for ships to roll into the space station and talk to the pilots you will eventually find someone to pay you upwards of  over the market value. Make the big money that way and buy a new ship from someone on the space station. I didnt have enough time to finsih mining the Emerli I was going for thats what Ill be doing tonight. Looking forward to a new ship maybe with  slots. Thatd be nice. Tired of these freaking space pirates. ,no_mans_sky,d6jxuqo,1,t5_2zcmw

I cant remember but I also thought they showed damage in such videos. From what Ive experienced the large scale combat as shown by the OP is  ships warp in from a given faction a bunch of pirates attack from my experience one of those bigger ships. No matter how long you wait to join that fight the ship doesnt get destroyed and the capital ships firing at said pirates never kill a single pirate.

Even what I have done is little compared the vastness of the size of the universe of NMS.gtI love exploring but what fun is exploring when theres nothing to find except silly looking animals and plants that mostly look the same.Procedurally generation can give silly results. Why werent you expecting that? Were you ignorant to what that means or simply had other presuppositions about the nature of life in NMS?There are  sentient races so far.  No denying that but even those have more than  differences each.gt that build a variety of like  different buildings evenly spaced awaySpoken like someone that never left his ship out of eye sight.  Flying over they are close getting out and walking and finding one can be hard to do.  I guess that explains much.  gtIts not deep. I love real exploration and finding hidden things. Nothing is hidden because theres no where to hide.You have no basis for your conclusion.  Why are you even replying to me?  You know nothing. You have nothing to back up your opinion.  Did you or anyone you know other than me find a water snek? No? then because YOU didnt find it does that mean it doesnt exist? Or it was never there for you to find?Exactly.
