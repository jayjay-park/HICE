2126741,0,t3_2jbawh,Thats the dream. Ive always hated sheiks owned clubs but I gotta admit I would be the happiest man alive. Just thinking about what they can do about the new stadium new training centre new youth systems these are all investments which do not affect the FFP.I hope they can make us become a big club by investing in the infrastructures and by increasing the revenues i.e. marketing sponsors rather than a few random cash injections. Really unlikely though but one can still hope.,sscnapoli,cla5lkh,5,t5_2spkf
2134965,0,t3_2jbawh,Super conflicted. While Id love to see what they would do does Napoli really want to been seen as only being able to reach the top with a Baby Daddy? ,sscnapoli,clb78qx,3,t5_2spkf

3349876,0,t3_2yg54o,I like how Hamsik just passes the ball through the legs of the defender and then just casually keeps walking and watching Higuain working his magic ,sscnapoli,cpa4004,2,t5_2spkf
4455828,0,t1_css9msh,Very much so! I was disappointed that Gianelli Imbula ended up signing for Porto when I heard we were in for him but Allan seems a very good choice as well,sscnapoli,cssc8am,2,t5_2spkf
5668409,0,t1_cwzpdok,Heres an article in englishTo summarize gt According to reports from several sources winger Dries Mertens has been injured on international duty while training with the Belgium national squad and hes expected to spend somewhere between four to five weeks on the sidelines rehabbing from a muscle tear. It is still not certain the extent of the injury but I would be surprised if he was featured before the new year.,sscnapoli,cwzpzn9,2,t5_2spkf
6922009,0,t3_4ajk96,I think this upcoming match day is our best chance to close the gap. Juve have Bayern mid week and then a derby del mole which is always unpredictable whereas we just need to collect three points against Genoa. Along with Roma playing inter this match week could prove pivotal for us.,sscnapoli,d10xmf7,7,t5_2spkf

8522450,0,t3_4wfy9g,from what I have heard he has burned too many bridges to ever return. Lavezzi still loves the club but Cavani has kind of gone cold about it.,sscnapoli,d66v8wj,2,t5_2spkf

9142627,0,t3_5592tp,If you could bring  young promising players to Napoli who would you pick? Its kind of a tricky question because the best talents out there wouldnt really come without a spot in the starting XI. Keep up the good work!,sscnapoli,d8aw6f5,2,t5_2spkf
9322284,0,t1_d8xlqlm,Great to hear you loved the city! It is an incredible place. A shame about the match although I guess its not so bad since it was a loss anyway ,sscnapoli,d8xo244,1,t5_2spkf

11271461,0,t1_df9juyv,I guess I just think of Mertens as the backup LW despite playing striker in Miliks absence. Would Keita want to come here to be Insignes backup? ,sscnapoli,df9lqot,2,t5_2spkf
