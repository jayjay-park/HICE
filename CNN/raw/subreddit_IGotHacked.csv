6856888,0,t3_47zeow,Why do you think that the DoS was initially targeting your SmartTV at first? Pic shows destination IP address of ... which is a public IP address which makes me curious as to how you determined that the packet was targeted at the SmartTV as opposed to your entire connection. Or was the address in Pic cut off like it is in Pic and really ... i.e. the private LAN IP of your SmartTV?Also Im curious as to what you mean when you say the destination IP address changed? Were these alerts created for packets arriving at the WAN interface? If so I question the claim that a packet somehow arrived at your WAN interface with a different destination IP address. Or were the alerts create for outgoing packets? If so perhaps one of your devices got owned and being used as part of a DDoS botnet.There seems to be a lot of possibly incorrect or incomplete information in your post so its hard to say exactly whats going on but generally speaking getting a couple of alerts on your WAN for SYN flood scans etc. are not necessarily something to worry about. Everybody is constantly getting scannedprobed on the internet. It might mean you are being attacked or were compromised or it might just be the normal background noise of being connected to the internet. Its hard to say at this point without further clarification.Also dont get panicked about the whole DoD IP address thing. IP address spoofing is trivial and you can rest assured that if the DoD had anything to do with it they sure as hell wouldnt be just doing a SYN DoS from their own network.If you want to be safe reinstall OS reset devices to factory settings upgrade firmware make sure you dont have any open portsdisable UPnP change all passwords and take extra care with your SmartTV as they tend to be notoriously vulnerable and easy to exploit.,IGotHacked,d0tjc7l,1,t5_30ln3
