In other words voting Agree would mean you wouldnt need to change anything about current DC practices.,NMS_Federation,dgmx5ha,1,t5_3k0sb
11757673,0,t3_67rt6b,This looks great! As for the Known Star Systems page I would recommend putting CategorySolarion Imperium at the bottom of each page. Then it just automatically organizes them for you. Or if you want one for specifically just star systems and nothing else you could make a CategorySolarion Imperium Systems category as well.Then you dont have to automatically add each system to the list and other people in your civilization who use a template assuming you eventually set one up can have their systems automatically added that way too. The Galactic Hub has  pages in its category so far Its nice having it all in one spot.,NMS_Federation,dgsrg2i,2,t5_3k0sb
