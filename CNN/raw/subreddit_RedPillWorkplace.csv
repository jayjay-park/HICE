10810548,0,t3_5ulp0a,The biggest problem Ive faced when mentoring dudes over time is that almost none of them apply raises to bump recurring income streams.  Im going to say that about  of men who get raises immediately increase their costs of living and the raise means nothing for the future.  In a pretty hefty minority of guys they actually spend MORE and save LESS when they get a raise because they feel they have future income coming to pay off debt easier.The best thing I ever did was what I call living on income from  years ago.  For example in  I lived on money I earned in  and saved for .  This gave me a lot of leeway to change customersjobsindustries because I always had a  year buffer.That  a year raise is significant because it can be  you put towards another income source.  I dont like acquiring debt but if I had gotten a  raise in a year I probably would have bought a  bedroom rental somewhere with a  year payoff on a note.  Or saved that  for  years and bought rental property.The only real way to get wealthy is to have a lot of other people working for you and you making k a year profit on their work each.  But that isnt easier its just more likely.,RedPillWorkplace,ddv15al,4,t5_3crsc
