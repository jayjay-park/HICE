97975,0,t1_cepf5zp,After the renovations Alta Bistro unfortunately isnt the value it once was.  No more  course menu means the food prices have increased by around .  Its still one of the best restaurants in Whistler but now its priced like it too!,Whistler,cepl1j5,0,t5_2s3ik

You will feel at home.Probably should plan to buy your gear in Vancouver. At least then if theres no good deals you still have the option of buying in Whistler. Not sure about which shops to recommend as I shop in Victoria.I dont know about hotels in Van. much again because I live in Victoria and dont stay in hotels in Van. more than once a year or two. I have stayed at a bunch of hotels in Whistler. But I dont know your price range.To ensure your riding progresses as fastly as possible you should take lessons. But they cost a fortune  for half a day at Whistler. I would find someone who used to instruct to teach you at a price you set in advance.PM me if you want to know any more.,Whistler,cqd3g4k,1,t5_2s3ik

5383294,0,t3_3oogbs,Im heading to Whistler the exact same week and we are staying in a kitchenette too. The cost of a bus from Vancouver airport for  people is almost the same as renting a car in Vancouver and dropping it off in Whistler. We are planning on getting groceries in Vancouver and bringing them to the hill. I found the cost of groceries a little pricy in Whistler last time I was there. I bought lift tickets in advance and when I picked it up at the hill there was a better deal and they gave me a gift card for . That  bought me  bowls of chilli on the peak so the price of food on the hill is quite expensive. Also if you are renting a car see how much the cost is at your hotel is for parking.,Whistler,cvzryms,1,t5_2s3ik

5835931,0,t1_cxkkuiq,BC is far more mountainous than Washington so that doesnt seem to be a valid explanation.I think a more plausible explanation is the opposite. Most of the Washington population doesnt even see snow in a typical year. Virtually all of BC does. So it wouldnt make a lot of sense for Washington to mandate winter tires. They settle for chains.,Whistler,cxkm8so,0,t5_2s3ik
5840235,0,t1_cxl3fwx,gt I think youll find that chains on passenger vehicles are uncommon in many other US states even in mountain passes where the locals deal with real winters regularly.Well this is definitely factually inaccurate You obviously havent lived in many places.Try driving through the Rockies without chains during a winter storm sometime. See how far state patrol will let you go.,Whistler,cxl6jwf,1,t5_2s3ik

7003744,0,t3_4blhb9,Sushi Village!!! I was there about  weeks ago. Amazing! and to top it off our waiter looked exactly like Chuck Norris... when we asked the other staff if hes been compared to Chuck previously they said it happens all the timethe menu is fantastic and the staff are awesome for recommending dishes on and off the menu.price may be more than your usual but it is worth it!,Whistler,d1a7w9q,0,t5_2s3ik

10455445,0,t1_dcst1sa,True.  But I dont believe there is one at the top of the gondy? So if this ticket lets you get on at the bottom you could just take it all the way up and do full mountain gondy laps rather than getting off at Olympic Chair...,Whistler,dct89in,1,t5_2s3ik
