As for the crowds it may not directly affect your experience but sometimes Ive noticed that if the fans arent giving the band a ton of energy the band wont give much energy back either.  Ex  Phoenix at Lolla put on an unbelievable show and the crowd was Lollapaloosing its collective mind.  Flash forward a few years to Phoenix at Coachella people in the crowd arent cheering very loudly the band asks a few times if people are having a good time eliciting a lukewarm response Phoenix kinda phones in the rest of the show and doesnt even come out for an encore they were Saturday headliners.  This is only one example.  Ive seen many bands dip in energy a bit on stage after Coachella crowds didnt really show much appreciation.,Lollapalooza,d18jphs,1,t5_2r3dl

7629400,0,t1_d30tauz,Both are great but completely different shows. Ellie will look and sound great. Shes been super consistent for a while now. With Ellie its What you see is what you get Her songs wont deviate that much from the albums. Which isnt a bad thing if you like her stuff.LCD will be easier to get closer too and youll want to do that if you do decide on their show. Im a fan of both acts I think the pay off for LCD is greater. Theyre a live band. They sound ok on their albums kind of repetitive. But it all comes together so well live in a very tight jam session. James is always moving around up there and will surely have some funny shit to say. His banter is always fun although hes cut it down since their return. Hes really taking the return serious and tries to fit as many songs into his sets as possible. Not a bad thing.Good news for you...they are both extremely dancy fun sets. You cant go wrong haha.

I do not understand your point about tyoe diabetes because it isnt expressed in a form that is logical or coherent. But now that you have clarified I do get it. You feel that anyone who criticizes someone for drinking too much or taking more substances that they can handle would also in any and all cases refuse medical treatment to someone who suffers from typeII diabetes. How is it possible to know this?   I see your larger point about empathy and compassion but I disagree with the sense that assigning blame to people who make conscious choices that leave them unconcious should not have their choices criticized. You may somewhere in your mind think that these are perfect tlt acceptable choices. I disagree. Ive helped plenty of people to the med tent. Did I do so without empathy or compassion?   You also used the expression hurr durr to imply that I was mentally retarded. Since you dont know me that is quite a stretch. It was completely uncalled for too.

You have to look at like this its  and the quality of acts is diminishing but Chella and Lolla tend to find the right balance of filler and quality acts throughout three or four days. In this instance Coachella nabbed three of the best headliners anyone can get and still managed to get an exciting undercard as well. Obviously theres some repeats here but are they touring? Are they relevant? Did their albums at least make some noise or make a lot of noise? Yes all across the board for most of the higher billed acts. Sure you can question the billing of some of these acts but in their respective fields from Father John Misty Empire of the sun DJ Khaled they are wildly popular. I mean Warpaint has played Chella three times and theyre on the fourth line for Sat....youre not telling me thats not impressive?

Just gotta butt into conversations with people and everyone around you will totally welcome you into the conversation. Especially since most people are talking about music and thats what were all there for. If you dont have an instagram itd be a good idea to get one. Thats the main social media platform people have used at least with me at shows so we can keep in some form of contact. Ive met many people that way! I dont really use snapchat but thats another popular one people use to stay in contact. Youll make friends from all over the place. Its awesome.

11251348,0,t1_df7b74c,Off the top of my head I remember him predicting lineupticket release dates incorrectly but Ill try and use uneddit or something to look through deleted comments. I understand that if he truly is an industry insider its possible that artists drop out and whatnot but I just dont feel convinced that he is who he says he is. I find it hard it hard to believe a name as big as Travis Scott would drop off of the lineup  days before its release especially due to booking a tour date in Chicago. I find it harder to believe that acts as big as The WeekndWiz Khalifa could be booked on this short notice to replace him. Those are his claims from the last two weeks alone. I have nothing against jj but I cant justify treating his word as gospel.,Lollapalooza,df7bnz2,1,t5_2r3dl
