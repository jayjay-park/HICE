4518047,0,t3_3cyi29,Im assuming youre a US citizen.  My experience is that paperworkwise its the same as flying to and from New Jersey.    A license has always been fine for me.  However if you head out on a day trip to the BVIs you will need a passport.  This Customs link  confirms you do not need a passport but interestingly does indeed recommend you have a birth certificate along with your ID... Not sure what would happen if they wanted that second form of ID and you didnt have it but Ive never had an issue.  ,virginislands,ct0564g,3,t5_2tpp0
4520156,0,t1_ct08vxd,Its less touristy because theres a lot higher unemployment and therefore a lot more crime.  But honestly its like being in any other city just have your wits about you and dont be in certain places after dark.  ,virginislands,ct0ep20,2,t5_2tpp0
4529944,0,t1_ct0ep20,St Croix tends to gets bad name as far as crimemurders.  If I remember correctly the  islands are usually almost identical in homicides every year..  With STT having la smaller population actually makes STT more dangerous.  In  each island having exactly  murders. Yes the territory has an obscene murder rate but it is not directed toward tourists.   Your biggest concern as a tourist on either island is getting your purse stolen or something petty. As with any big city you have to be careful.  If you go to rough parts of town looking for drugs etc you most likely will run into trouble.  I lived in St. Croix for  years and never felt unsafe and I was working at a bar and walking to my car at all hours of the night. Im rambling a little but I always felt it was unfair to paint STX in such a bad light.  ,virginislands,ct1mvkc,1,t5_2tpp0

9574994,0,t1_d9t7tp1,I do Sales and Marketing for my FL based company in the Caribbean Basin. Thats why I still travel there. I used to work in St Thomas in a scuba diving tour so I feel you.St Thomas is more commercial frequented and better connected. When there are cruiseships there during the high season the population basically doubles. I liked it better since it didnt feel so small some times. When there are no ships it feels very sparsely populated. When the ships are in en masse. Feels like any bustling city.St Johns is a paradise. Slow and calm if thats your thing. Accesible via a short ferry from St Thomas.St Croix I found it to be a little bit more expensive IMHO. Farther apart from the other two it has its own rhythm. Taking a taxi there was always a basic rate of .When it comes to Puerto Rico You CAN make it here some basic Spanish will go long ways along with your already fluent English. I do have family in advertising and they are basically very hipster... ish. They live well not too much pressure and super laid back scene.In PR mainlanders either stay in the cosmopolitan Condado Isla Verde or Old San Juan. Super touristy. Or they go east to Fajardo Vieques or Culebra our offshore municipalities or spanish virgin islands or to Rincon on the west coast of PR. Rincon is like a little surfing town youll get a California vibe.Feel free to ask me anything!And for verification I live in the  zipcode. Lol,virginislands,d9tbau4,3,t5_2tpp0
