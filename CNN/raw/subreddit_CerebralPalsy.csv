6164045,0,t3_3zxet1,CP is caused by dead brain tissue messing with the electrical signals to the musclessuper basic explanation. If you had it it would show up in a brain scan and that scan would have been done when you were  to  years old.  Its possible to have something else with similar symptoms so go and get an MRI.  Remember a Google search is not a PhD in medicine. ,CerebralPalsy,cyqaepg,2,t5_2rpsy

10379149,0,t3_5olcuk,CP really stinks and its really hard to explain to people without it how much it really stinks. My CP affects my left side so playing guitar is pretty much impossible. As is playing piano. And sports were out if the question growing up.Now that the negativity is out of the way the best you can do is go to your strengths and not worry about the things you cant do. Though I am myself religious I do not believe that I was given CP for a higher reason. It just is. But what CP can do is give you a different perspective in life and help you to be a more humble person. Keep on keeping on. ,CerebralPalsy,dckjgye,1,t5_2rpsy
