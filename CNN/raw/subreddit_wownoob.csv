2711800,0,t3_2r47lp,The best only? way to get better at PvP is to PvP.  The learning curve is pretty steep initially and its a totally different game than PvE.Pare your UI down as much as possible dont worry about tracking every little thing.  Try out the most passive talents you can so you dont have to worry about hitting  buttons.  First start with random BGs or other casual stuff skirmishes try to avoid vehicle BGs.  Its going to feel like full blown chaos compared to PvE like youre trying to drink through a fire hose this is fine.  Focus on one objective or section try not to get into big battles where youre going v.  Learn the terrain well and contribute to your team how you can.  Try to avoid getting v stay in a small group if possible.Do this for a while small focused learning and youll start to get a feel for the flow of battle and how your class plays.  Once you get to that level you can start to be more tactical and strategic.  You can peel off healers and pressure the opponents.  Use CC proactively and start to meddle with your spec more.Again this should all be in a noncompetitive environment.  Stick with it for a while and youll get the hang of it.,wownoob,cncbk5j,3,t5_35idp

7612274,0,t3_4jince,. If you want to level it quickly then yes doing so without Herbalism would be expensive. There are cheap but slow ways to level it though. At level  theres a catchup mechanic for all professions.. My warlock has never been affliction but yeah an imp set to assist sounds like the way to go.. No playable characters are members of the Burning Legion. The Legion is the dark side. At worst player characters are dark dark gray. Playable warlocks are just magicusers who have an endsjustifythemeans fightfirewithfire attitude towards the Legion.. I believe when youre into endgame minmaxing a wand or other onehanded item plus offhand item gives more total stats. When leveling though its much easier to keep a single item like a staff upgraded than two items so thats what Id recommend.. No. There are a lot of reasons to have alts professions seeing different factions or questlines more shots at timelimited stuff just plain fun but theyre almost never worth it for utility stuff like that.. Not really. Just keep the pet from dying so much. Not sure about affliction but demonology warlocks can heal their demon and destruction warlocks can resurrect them on a oneminute cooldown with an ember. Out of combat you can drink water from innkeepers to replenish your mana.. No. They used to be and maybe they will be again in Legion I dont know but not now. ,wownoob,d37h4zm,1,t5_35idp

8135072,0,t3_4qncmr,How much effort do you put into recruiting nonraiding members in a guild that is devoted to raiding?I ask because Ive run a guild for a bit that originally was born out of a raid team. It was always mainly a raiding guild with most of the active members raiding regularly. Most are adults with regular jobs kids and etc. who you tend to only see on raid nights. The rest of the week some people may be on here and there doing their own things but it tends to be pretty quiet.I never gave too much thought to sorting out regular raiders from other recruits. We have some people who raid and we have some people who never do and consistent raiders get minor perks like more bank access since they need it but I dont require anyone to raid if they dont want to.I thought this was working out fine but then I had one person who was a very active consistent raider leave because there were not enough people logged in outside of our usual raiding schedule. I havent heard this complaint from anyone else but it made me wonder.In your experience is it possible to run a raiding guild that just raids and does little else? Or do you find that raiders tend to drift away when the guild isnt also hopping with casual and social members?,wownoob,d4ugf7a,2,t5_35idp

8255733,0,t3_4selsu,You can minmax any of the classes but right now for the best minmaxiness youll probably need to go with a pure dps class which is magehunterroguewarlock. BUT and its a big BUT its all about to change. I would recommend playing what youre comfortable with because you can pull of insane stuff with any class. Ive had epic moments on my DK Rogue Shaman Warrior Mage and Hunter. Simply just knowing how your class mechanics work and maximizing them will make you a better player than most. I cant tell you how many egos I busted when I showed up in heroic gear and was doing equal damage to the geared raider. Or the loud wooshing sound when I took the top slot every raid. That being said there is always someone better than you. Dont let it get to your head.Tanking can be fun but it sounds like youd actually contribute far more as an effective DPS who can dip into tanking when needed. Until youre doing hard content tanking honestly is pretty rote and boring. Same with healing.

8348876,0,t3_4txgrw,Hello!Thought Id share my personal setup works for me across all characters and link the addon that makes it possible. I recommend checking out Dominos its a great improvement from the basic UI and is really simple to use Id never use anything else after setting this up. Also OmniCC is an addon that will add cooldown text to all these bars making it much easier to track the cooldowns on your abilities. Here is a link to an old screenshot showing that the  bars at the bottom which I think look way smaller and neater than the basic UI and are much easier to customise the keybindings to.In terms of binds I use     Q E for my main rotational abilities as theyre all very easy to click and close by for that finger. Less used abilities such as cooldowns or heals etc I use on F G Z X which are pretty comfortable to press every minute or two. I use V for interrupt on every one of my characters Important! Makes it such easy and quick muscle memory to get used to if things are uniform across toons. For other abilities I use shift modifiers which sounds hard to get used to but once you learn them then it really becomes second nature. Things like ShiftE of ShiftQ are pretty easy to press again for lesser used cooldowns I generally use them for defensives. Also if you see in the screenshot then ShiftQ is located above Q ShiftE above E ShiftF above F etc which I find makes it easy to follow and remember  Oh also I use middle mouse button and shiftmiddle mouse for things another easy button to press for lesser used abilities. My mouse also has extra buttons which in the screenshot I think are bound to   and  but if you have extra buttons on your mouse then you can use whatever the software is to bind them to a lesser used key in WoW then make that key part of your dominoes setup too.I definitely rambled a lot but TLDR Download dominos! Its excellent and if you need any help setting it up feel free to pm me D ,wownoob,d5l5uqe,2,t5_35idp

It is our a tanks responsibility to make sure everyone is ready and comfortable with an up coming pull. That includes but is not limited to taking dungeons slow knowing mechanics and more importantly making sure the healer is ready so the tank and of course Dps dont die. As for practice solo youve really already done what you can. Maybe try some random bgs?

8902263,0,t3_525gsi,The Focused Rage variant of Arms is a pretty substantial DPS increase for single target encounters. The tradeoff you make of course is having to be a bit more careful managing your rage but in the end the DPS increase is so much that Icy Veins recommends waiting through some GCDs to ensure you have enough rage to use Mortal Strike. I have personally gotten crits as high as k on a fully buffed Mortal Strike against a level  open world enemy. Im not sure if it would be absolutely necessary in Mythic but Im betting most Arms Warriors will be using it.

9184914,0,t3_564ll1,Hey Ive played both so I can give ya a hand.. WoW is an unbelievably lore rich game. As you level your going to be skimming through a lot of the story that has happened so far not to experience those events like you do in ff but simply to level through them. Once you get to the current expansions content will you be able to experience a complete storyline as it comes out. Currently we the champions of Azeroth and fighting back a demon invasion. We are searching for ancient artifacts called the Pillars of Creation said to have been made by the Titans the creators of our universe. At the present moment players are assistant malfurion stormrage in cleansing a dark evil in the druids meditative homeworld known as the Emerald Dream. Thats the current end game the emerald nightmare is the latest raid release. There is a LOT of backstory to this game and quite frankly a huge chunk of players dont actually know it. Your main goal is to get to that end game and beat it!. Yes. Ours rotates on Tuesdays. . Yes they play quite similarly. I will be blunt and say that raiding in WoW is significantly harder than ff but once you get the hang of it Its not too bad.. Professions are not NEEDED to participate in end game content. They do however make you a lot of gold right now and you need the gold to buy supplies to take with. Flasks potions food enchants gems these are all things you need when you start raiding. Working on your professions and knowing how to use them will be of huge use to you to get them.  ,wownoob,d8g970e,2,t5_35idp

I ask because it might be easier to quest and stay in that continent. Vanilla zones which are kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom zones offer a bit more variety where you can go. Once you go to Outlands there choice is less BUT since you say you are a bit OCD it can help to put a bit variety. What I mean is you can go forward and back if you like. Maybe in the new zone they want you to collect X amount of hidenoseswhatever but shoot there was a kill quest back where I was let me do that one quick.Professions help to gather yourself too.  Cause maybe you are cooking or fishing while waiting on dungeon finder. If you are gathering you see that quest you missed and im in the area  complete.Main thing is to breathe and one step at a time.

Probably not the fastest way to level but it should work. Ive leveled my current char to  like this but Ive done a bunch of world event stuff as well.I dont think raceclass should matter much maybe a Rogue so you can collect pets in stealth more easily but I dont think thats really necessary to be honest.

Up at the top you can pick the role youre queueing for I think it defaults to picking the role of your spec but you can also pick other ones your class can do so for Druid you could pick any of them.Then hit Find Group at the bottom and it will queue you. Once youre at the front of the queue it will put a group together for you from other queued playersone tank one healer three DPSes. Then youll be invited to the group. Once you and the other four people accept youll be teleported to the dungeon.From what I understand and from my experience so far as a tank youll basically instantly form a group because there are tons of DPSes but far fewer tanks queueing for dungeons Im not sure about the ratio of healers to tanks but both times Ive queued it instantly found one.,wownoob,d9olgcr,1,t5_35idp

Free swaps to each spec as long as you are out of combat with the bonus of auto swapping your weapon if youve gotten the specs legendary.  Just remember that you need to select your talents the first time you activate a different specialization.One of the anticipated features of the up coming patch will be the change of AP items to bound on account.

Single target for bosses?There are situations where you might respec between raid bosses.

10752586,0,t1_ddp0nnt,Alright sounds like good advice. Im mainly wondering where I should be looking guilds from. When I rerolled and tried finding guilds I looked at realms Wowprogress and checked those guilds. At least back then almost every guild there had some sort of website and required applying. It felt stupid I had to write application even to mediocre casual guilds at their websites and it pretty soon overwhelmed me and I gave up looking raid guilds. Back then I was under  years old many guilds were   and my classes were mage and DK I played both dps and tank on DK. Currently I am over  years and willing to play healer so I guess Im more qualified for guilds now LULAny other methods for finding guilds?Spamming  with LFG messages sounds a bit dumb I guess its not good way?,wownoob,ddp1p71,1,t5_35idp

11072199,0,t3_5y2myx,If youre quickly leveling I probably wouldnt worry about it just yet. As soon at you hit Mists of Pandaria content at  youre going to be grounded again. Youll stay grounded from there on out in leveling content through Warlords and Legion. Like that other comment said by then you should have plenty of gold just from looting and vendoring stuff.Few tips thoughInstall the addon HandyNotes and all of its modules for the different xpacs i.e. Pandarean  Draenor  Legion Treasures. Starting in Mists there will be random treasures and items scattered all over each questing area mostly hard to find or slightly hidden. This marks their spots on your maps so when youre near one you can just go loot it. Most are vendor items that sell for gold or gold itself. This will greatly add to your pocket book as you level. You might wanna start working with the Auction House. Selling whatever leveling mats youve collected along the way. If you still have a bunch of green BOEs from  then check their going rates on your AH some go for crazy amounts of gold for transmog. Theres tons of other stuff to do but thats the easiest most passive.,wownoob,den0us4,5,t5_35idp
