2443444,0,t1_cmdpmqw,Im not sure of the brand that I use I buy it from work. We have a make up artist who sells make up and I get them for  dollars each so cant beat that. The color payoff is awesome and the formula is great. I use mostly ELF brushes because theyre cheap. Most of them are fairly old so Im thinking thats the problem. I usually start from the bottom and work up and put darker colors on last because I dont like how they mix on the brush.,newbieMUA,cmdpq5r,2,t5_353ld
