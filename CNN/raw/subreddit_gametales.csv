2224070,0,t3_2kk1cq,My most memorable character death was selfinflicted.To set the scene the party had gathered things called elemental souls they can only exist inside a mortal being a mortal can only hold one at a time and when the carrier dies the soul goes into the nearest living being.our party of six had collected the five elemental souls and were following the npc questgiver to go use their power to close the gates of notcthulhus prison forever. as were going along a few of us notice the questguy had stopped looking deadonhisfeet tired and seemed fairly healthy. OOC we all realized shit was about to go down but metagaming is severely punished in our group seriously one time a solid gold cow fell from the upper atmosphere and crushed a character because his player used out of game knowledge to win a fight so IC nobody said shit.So we arrive at the place the ritual is going to take place the five of us carrying elemental souls are helping draw the circles that will draw out the macguffin to close the prison so we thought IC and Jetharius only one without a element soul was standing a little ways away scratching his arse and being despondent that he wasnt going to be part of the ritual. thirty ingame minutes later the circles are complete and questguy cackles madly ad gestures at the five of us holding the souls. We get sucked inside of the circles and cant get out. Questguy throws a spell of protection over himself so Jetharius cant get close enough to go stabby and then of course the fucker started his monologue. He talked about how this ritual was going to summon the worldslayer sword and he was going to use the sword to cut his masters chains and unleash a thousand years of torment for all of reality. and this is when I realized what I needed to do.switching to incharacterJetharius run! you cannot defeat him alone! I screamed forcing panic and despair into my voice hoping that our betrayer would believe me despondent with broken will. Jetharius looked at me with shock I had never run from a battle and neither had he we always fought to the bitter end regardless of our chances of victory. I locked eyes with him and nodded once quickly letting my brother see the fire still burning in my eyes. Jetharius gritted his teeth and began backing away from the dark sorcerer.While he did I reviewed what I could remember about the spirit of fire I was holding in me. An elemental soul can only exist inside of a mortal host a mortal can only hold one soul at a time and when the host dies the soul enters the closest available host. Now I just had to hope the man in front of me still qualified as a host and that the circle I stood in would still do its job.Skyfather hear my words. I die now by my own hand if I am to be judged a coward for this action then so be it I do this for all of existence. With my final prayer uttered I took a deep breath and found the pumping rage in my veins I entered my godblessed state of berserker fury and then i fought against the thoughtless bloodlust long enough to set my claws upon my head and twist savagely. The black halls came quickly and I felt my spirit leave stretching the wings of my soul and flying with glorious joy towards whatever awaited me in the halls of judgement.exiting incharacter perspectiveso with a will save and a strength check I broke my own neck. the elemental soul of fire entered questgivers body and he was sucked into the circle with my corpse. The chains holding Cthulhu remained strong and the world was safe. All we had to do was return worldslayer to where it came from and the ritual would be complete well the hosts of the elemental souls would all be dead and that kind of sucked but hey we saved the world right?Wrong. see Jetharius failed the everloving fuck out of his exceptionally large number of knowledge and intelligance checks yes the typo is on purpose and thought that to make the ritual fizzle he had to stick the sword in the ground or a rock or something. So with a flourish of pride did Jetharius sink the blade of the worldslayer deep into the ground completely destroying it. Literally slaying the entire world.and that is the best death ive ever encountered.,gametales,clmj6vl,13,t5_2wqgc
2279426,0,t3_2lb2l7,Oh! One thing that warrants elaboration...Our monk was a real character. She had pretty low Int but high Wis and would occasionally say things that caught everyone completely offguard. When she picked up a spiffy headband at the dragon island her Wis shot even higher and she started catching glimpses through the fourth wall. It was like her whole life was in comic book format and she could just barely see into some of the other panels.Guys we have to get out of here the evil wizard is going to cast a spell that will fill this room with poison gas!What? How do you know that?I dont know.The DM was pretty flexible with just how we manifested our powers and abilities.

Unless Erinyes can pull some Sauron homingbeacon shit.Even better Find the watch and take out one singular gear and replace it with another nearly identical gear with half the teeth. Just to see what happens. Also keep the original gear on your person just to be safe.ampnbspAs for my setting the Fey or the Fae because I like artsy bullshit spellings were complete and total assholes as the Fae are prone to be. You know murder slavery fine print the whole shebang. So humans got sick of em and closed down all the portals to and from the Fae realm.When the Fae managed to get them back open what they found was a small army of iron golems set to walk forward punch things in the way and generally not give a shit about anything the Fae try to do to stop them. The Fae were taken by complete surprise and the iron golems marched on in and slowly annihilated their world. Ecologically anyway. Fae creatures died left and right and those golems are STILL THERE TODAY spreading the taint of iron deeper and deeper into their dying world.However some of the Fae creatures survived. The elf counterpart race the Faeren is actually a remnant of the Fae people that managed to make the worldhop and magic away their weakness to iron. They still cant return to their world though because its still ecologically fucked and you cant fix planets on the same scale as genes. The Faeren are excessively polite and paranoid determined not to have the humans unleash a SECOND armageddon on them.,gametales,cmzew8q,4,t5_2wqgc

Outstanding start.The fight goes on in my favor for a few turns until finally the other player lands a With Style roll on my knight with some Sith Lightning launching her across the room and sticking her with a consequence.My Padawan being cocky and now upset starts to go all in.

Hmm now Im wondering about the mechanics of such a curse...Would any name he used be enough to find him indefinitely and would names or designations given to him by others work as well? Did the person have to know it was him in particular? For example if he was in disguise andor under a false name would they know it was really him automatically if they already had the curses knowledge andor would they be able to follow him by his false identity if they hadnt known him before and he ditched the false persona? What if they had only heard of him from another? Was second or thirdhand information enough to trigger the curse into giving away his location? What about any potential body or soulswapping?Maybe its a bit munckiny of me to go so indepth on what was probably just a trivial thing to the character and player but Im the kind of guy who always wants to know how things work on a fundamental level so the idea of this curse and how it operates is pretty fascinating to me.,gametales,cpl5djk,3,t5_2wqgc

We were done with the main quest line of our game and stayed at an Inn when apparently our gm felt like it was time for a random encounter. We hear a loud noise of wood breaking from the common room so we all get out of bed and hurry downstairs to the sight of a freaking hill giant breaking in. Roll initiative. My dwarven cleric goes first and summons a celestial bison which in my mind looks like Appa from ATLA. The bison fumbles and fall prone at the feet of the giant. Now its the giants turn. It grabs a table and crits the bison with it. One hit KO. Then it becomes the fighter who of course also crits and in return one hit KOs the giant.We all stand in awe and realize that all this happened in the span of six seconds.

Sleepwalkers were known to the other Splicers  as having one key weakness. If they were roused they would let out an explosion of whatever superpower they were using. It would do no damage to them but incredible damage to anything or anyone not behind cover.In order to recover a piece of armor needed to get a powerful man on their side the PCs had to sneak through an asylum of Sleepwalkers trying not to rouse them.The first time a Sleepwalker was roused everyone around had to make a saving throw against an explosion of extremely venomous spiders.

7668934,0,t1_d3dqsbn,Dont worry Ive got plenty left to share about this group.  One of my favorite parts is actually coming up next.And funnily enough were such a hodgepodge group that it didnt really screw up the overall story too much.,gametales,d3dwwy2,1,t5_2wqgc
7740585,0,t1_d3m1ed8,Well it is nothing like Elites. You can have small engagements Large Engagements And very large engagements As you can see it is not a first person dogfighting game. Having said that nothing raises my heartbeat like some fights. First time I was PvPing I ended up shaking with adrenaline. The strength of EVE is in its depth and Sandbox mechanics. I can be a cloaky bomber or a fast interceptor stopping larger ships from escaping before support arrives. I can have a huge carrier that rains fighters on enemies. I can also mine in peace to make money or harvest in dangerous space for more valuable materials I can later sell on the player market. I can go on an explorer ship and get myself lost in wormholes finding relic sites and valuable items in there. I think that is the coolest thing about EVE. ,gametales,d3m1r6c,4,t5_2wqgc
8010273,0,t1_d4gdnxx,While that would make sense I find it more amusing to have a character whos so pitifully weak that it takes a significant effort for him to do any damage at all even with a sharp dagger.,gametales,d4gfh3i,3,t5_2wqgc
8182708,0,t3_4rbufj,Youre not dead! Thats awesome! Nice to see this is still going D,gametales,d50e004,3,t5_2wqgc
8418093,0,t3_4ut8oo,Admittedly I feel like a couple of her ideas would be cool in a vacuum. The image of an army of soldiers cutting their tongues out so as not to swear a new allegiance is pretty metal. It sounds like the kind of thing youd hear in a brutal old myth.,gametales,d5tszfc,31,t5_2wqgc
8503217,0,t1_d644r3y,Kind of like MTGs system of different planes for different genres! ,gametales,d64gf6i,2,t5_2wqgc

8995821,0,t1_d7t4sbw,Glad to hear it. Having been playing DampD is  I can tell you it will make for some of the most fun times with your friends youll ever have.Love to hear what you have planned for your own campaign.Not having the time to write my own stuff these days Im enjoying Defiance in Phlan which is part of the DampD Expeditions series of PDFs so if youre ever stuck for material the DampD Expeditions series is pretty good.,gametales,d7t5pj2,3,t5_2wqgc
9123101,0,t3_557z7x,Great read but I want to know what did Fluer spray paint? Did she mean to spray paint the markings of a known French terrorist cell or did the GM make that a coincidence?Also not clear did you guys kill Edgelord and dump the body?,gametales,d88g4m8,8,t5_2wqgc
9139022,0,t1_d8adebp,He said he got the deck two years ago. So Im thinking maybe Daretti?,gametales,d8afr6p,6,t5_2wqgc
9141256,0,t1_d8al3uw,I didnt even think of politics until pro mentioned it after the first game. I think I had thrown down a curse on him first thing then Dave immediately removed it and pro was saying he didnt do anything to Dave till the end Idk how true that was I was trying not to get flayed. Though Dave admited he just did it because he could.,gametales,d8apxfh,3,t5_2wqgc
9199276,0,t1_d8i12zw,I try to downplay them. GURPS e is good for that.. clear charts for critical hits and misses in combat and notes for critical successes and failures for noncombat rolls so its possible to roll a natural  and only have normal damage no chance at dodge or parry though so you still get something or roll an  and not die or TPK.It doesnt help that I lurk in rDnDGreentext so I get regular doses of Natural..Fucking..X in what feels like every friggin story.Maybe a part of it is also generational.. too much exposure to the Million Ways to Die kind of random charts of doom.,gametales,d8i2qwh,12,t5_2wqgc
9531399,0,t1_d9mtrsd,well the dragonborn my character weighs  pounds alone and thats not even with his equipment,gametales,d9ny1f2,3,t5_2wqgc
9650543,0,t1_da2kshs,Thanks! Im glad that you enjoyed it.I believe that it was treated as an improvement that allowed her to morph her skin and change her bone structure. Mechanics wise it gave her a  to any disguise checks that she made. ,gametales,da2mnzw,2,t5_2wqgc
9740590,0,t3_5emms2,Just means that the leader of the cult trusted the B team with this task... perhaps the A team will have better luck.,gametales,dadqnyd,28,t5_2wqgc
10041234,0,t3_5jflbb,As someone who has very little tabletop experience but has considered DMing for other newbies what do you do in this situation? Is it appropriate to offer a doover because his character would obviously know the difference between books and beer regardless of what he calls them? Or do you just keep going because it already happened? ,gametales,dbgedst,16,t5_2wqgc
10468498,0,t1_dcumro3,I dont know how this keeps getting missed  they knew it was a contract with a devil before fulfilling it and before they lost their powers.,gametales,dcupm9c,2,t5_2wqgc

10968034,0,t3_5wcxw5,My favorite thing to do as a player which I dont get to be very often anymore is to develop characters. Im huge into story and how the world and adventure shapes the character Im playing. Their views. Their reactions. What they care about. Their feelings towards the other characters. Having said that this story absolutely strikes a chord with me. And if your player was clever it could likely have gone the opposite way. The wizard dies and the Warlock takes it as a personal affront changing their alignment and motivations. That would have also been interesting to see fleshed out. ,gametales,deb9x07,1,t5_2wqgc
