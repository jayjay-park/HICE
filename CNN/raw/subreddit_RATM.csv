8106407,0,t1_d4r8a1s,The internet is not super helpful on this topic.  Several lyrics sites have it as pendejo which made sense to me because its a real rude word.  Some have it as pen devil.  My friend says he remembers it being pen devil on the lyrics sheet that came with the album.  I should note it appears in two songs that I can recall  Down Rodeo and Guerilla Radio. ,RATM,d4r8e5v,1,t5_2sgz6
