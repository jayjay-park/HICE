5135394,0,t1_cv4g8tu,Hi here are the photos of both palettesThe Hourglass palette has barely been used as I had  of the fullsized blushes when I bought it.  I do not have the box.  The Monarch palette has very light use as well although the shadows in the photos look as if they have more usage it is the way the light reflects off them from the photo.  Only a few colors have been used less than x and the others either untouched or just swatched.  I do have some one else interested in the Blush palette and am waiting on her to get back to me.  If you are interested and want to discuss price for both these items please PM me and I will need your postal code or country location to calculate shipping.,AussieMakeupExchange,cv508sc,1,t5_2yuq3
