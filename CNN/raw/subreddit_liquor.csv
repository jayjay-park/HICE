4670076,0,t1_ctfyer7,Ill stand up for the margarita!  Properly made it is a drink of depth and elegance.  Badly made it is an abomination  but that can be said of a lot of cocktails.  It has no bitters but otherwise follows the same basic template as many classic drinks  spirit citrus sweet liqueur.  My personal pet peeve on this front actually has to do with Tommys in SF  they make a great drink using just tequila ice lime and agave syrup but its not a margarita in any classic sense  its more like a tequila daiquiri.  That would be annoying but fine except that now all the Tommys fans run around claiming that their approach is the best and denigrating anyone who dares to add Cointreau even though Cointreau or the equivalent is a defining characteristic of the cocktail as historically understood...,liquor,ctj7rmy,1,t5_2rgdw

10012991,0,t3_5j0rvf,I will be blunt. The only thing you can do is give it time. Your body is an amusment park and you should enjoy the rides but anytime you ride something too hard or improperly it will break. When it breaks you should number one be greatful it didnt kill you. Number two if you are even considering getting back on that ride you better sure as shit learn how to ride that thing properly. TlDr In short you broke your ride. Be thankful you are alive and mentally stable then spend some time fixing it and learning how to use it safely.I dont really care about the why aspect of all this although most people might but the point remains that you admitted to almost finishing a  standard shots in a btl so  is pretty close bottle on two separate occasions. That is massive damage to your liver over a short period of time. Hardcore alcholics can do that but they treat their liver like a muscle and work it out every day. Do you?You baisically subjected yourself to a form of toxic shock and your body is in recoil from it. It is also actively rejecting something it knows from past experiences to be dangerous. It is an amazing form of self defense we are very fortunate to have considering we do nothing to control it aside from breaking the ride. Milk Thistle Tea is thought to help liver functions so you can try that but please rethink your drinking habits. Try and focus on quality made products and steer clear of Fireball. Not only is that shit disgusting but it contains more sugar than alcohol and a variety of other garbage that you dont really want to subject your body to. Avoiding sugar in the alcohol you drink will dramatically improve your odds of waking up feeling ok. I really cant stress that point more without seeming like more of an asshole than I probably already come off as. Cut out the sugar. As much as you can from your entire diet. It will go a long way to recovery.If you must drink cinnamon whiskey do this instead Get a decent bottle of bourbon no more then  and two cinnamon sticks. Take a shot of whiskey and put the cinnamon sticks in the bottle. Seal er up and let it sit for  or  days. Make some simple syrup c to c boiling water and sugar cooled and sweeten the infusion to taste. The longer you let the ingredients sit together the better flavor the end result will have.Dont drink a whole bottle to your head unless you are a professional drinker goes without saying. As does make sure you eat fairly solidly and drink plenty of water when on a tear.You can rebuild your ride with the awareness of how to be safer in the future but you do now unfortunately need to give it some time. ,liquor,dbcpzjt,11,t5_2rgdw

10854329,0,t3_5urm7x,If youre buying the bottles and pouring them yourself at home perhaps the dishwashing solution isnt being completely rinsed from your glassware.  Since Pyrat is bottled in Guyana and Markers Mark is bottled in Kentucky its highly unlikely the problem is with the spirits. ,liquor,ddzjpjn,2,t5_2rgdw
10904556,0,t1_de4p3gc,I prefer Johnny Walker Black Label if Im feeling sorry for myself but as far as bourbon goes Wild Turkey  or Jim Beam Black label are both great versatile whiskeys imo.I have a soft spot for Turkey because of the  proof and it was the first whiskey I really enjoyed drinking. It can be astringent because of the alcohol content but makes great high balls or a quick two shot buzz.Beam Black is incredibly smooth and fairly complex in flavor. Wild Turkey has a bright sunshiny flavor while Beam Black is a bit darker and straightforward yet surprisingly complex..kinda like Turkish tobacco.Evan Williams Black Label and Ancient Age  are both sufficient bottomshelf bourbon for mixing and shotssipping but Benchmark No.  is where its at..its a bottomshelf bourbon that blew my socks off with its complexity and price. ,liquor,de4q6zt,1,t5_2rgdw
