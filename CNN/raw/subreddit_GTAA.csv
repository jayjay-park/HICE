Ala not being able to fit in the LSC  garage Or being absurd like a Lazer.  Out of all the thinks players want They seem to yearn and pine for a fucking SQUAD CAR more then anything else People would LOVE it They could probably get away with making them extremely overpriced as Shark bait if they wanted! Its not like theyd have to program a lot of content and be hard at work for months They could add prices for the vehicles and upgrades Make a police auction site with uniforms and shit to boot for vigilante justice. I mean the players have written VOLUMES on why they should be able to have these Awesome factor RP And more. They havent even given many valid reasons why we CANT have cop cars They arent even blowing us off with the typical Stay tuned! These are reasonable Easily implementable things that are ALREADY IN THE GAME The most theyd have to do is bump up the customization a little so you can change the rims or some shit I mean in honesty having something like a cop car or a stockade is perfectly reasonable The stockade for example is slow and not completely indestructible A cop car is flawed enough too. Another thing that could be added is unlocking some of the paint colors the game ALREADY USES Wanna know what i mean?

When you spend lots of time together regardless is it in form of online gaming to any other activity or hobby people will create their own circles of active or otherwise approved people. Theyre called friends.This is what ive been saying for a long timeIf you feel left out in our crew be more active. Join in freemode sessions game invites host heists or other gamemodes. Chat in Discord. Thats were all the fun is and all the planning for events happens.I do remember you from  days and keep seeing you in my friendslist.

7190432,0,t1_d1v8yct,If you arent in the crew already youll miss this one and if you are you should flair up. But I host one of these sessions every week at the same time and I also happen to handle the invites for the XB side of the crew and process them every Monday. Social Club has had issues lately for the past couple of weeks but as soon as I am able to send out invites I will. Just make sure you follow every step in the application process. ,GTAA,d1vhoxo,1,t5_2z7ey

7876832,0,t1_d41cvmv,The rule is no killing crew members. The only exception is if both parties are partaking in a gameshenanigan where killing is integral and both parties have agreed its okay ie Infected Flare Wars or Jousting.The only other way I could see it being acceptable is if two crew members were in two different organisations in a random public freemode session and were in a direct battle with each other but this is pretty unlikely as theres no much point in a whole organisation fighting another one. ,GTAA,d41ffq4,5,t5_2z7ey
