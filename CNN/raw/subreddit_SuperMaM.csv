Here let me fix that for ya...Lets just throw out the fact that all evidence pointed to him OJ Simpson and most people believe it was him. Lets pretend that he didnt write a book detailing exactly how he did it. For this purpose we will give him  presumption of innocence.OJ Simpson yes Im using his full name actually was the prime suspect in perhaps one of the highest profile murder trials of all time. Naming him as a suspect isnt slanderous or libelous. Its a fact. Are you actually trying to suggest that mentioning his name in a forum on the Internet will have any negative effect on his life? Do you seriously believe that these comments will somehow trump the thousands of articles that have been written about this subject? Something tells me that you dont and that is why I referred to your OP as a strawman.On the other side of that coin you have many people who were not suspects in any murder case. Innocent people with families are being blamed for murder. This absolutely can effect these innocent people who were never suspects in any murder case.

What a pathetic little liar you are. Since my quote says Wiegert refused access on  to the remains while in Calumet police inventory room clearly you dont mean coroner access to the remains.  Clearly you mean coroner access to something else.

If there are  different types of slugs I see your point. But Im skeptical that a bunch of people are coming into Steves yard and shooting at that gopher. The salvage yard is a big place.

Recognizing a person you know is a lot different than trying to recognize someone you dont theres no way Earl is going to stand around chatting with Steve and later be unsure if it was Steve or not because he knows his brother.Dolores did not provide Steven with an alibi.  Brendan was with Steven but he was doing things related to the disposal of evidence.  Earl and Fabian saw Steven but he was doing things related to the disposal of evidence.

9538345,0,t1_d9om0c0,None of which has anything to do with your continued evasiveness and obfuscating over the garage searches and warrants and the way LE handled this biased investigation. LE was investigating a murder and had their lone suspect from before day . No amount of circlejerking or fortuitous reasoning changes that. Nice try though. gtRULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE gtSo where is the murder scene? When reporters asked Ken Kratz why he had not brought up the murder scene in trial I was absolutely dumbstruck at his answer. He said that he was going to explain all that ...in closing arguments. Whiskey tango foxtrot? Closing arguments do not introduce new evidence and are not evidence in and of themselves. gtA closing argument can only refer to evidence that has already been placed into the trial. What Kratz was admitting was that he had not a single shred of evidence to prove where the murder was carried out. But apparently that wasnt going to keep him from telling the jury where it was without evidence of any kind. To put forward a theory of how the crime could have happened without providing evidence for the conclusions is appalling.  If the judge allowed that well... I have no words...gtWhere does this leave us? Kratz doesnt know where the murder occurred he probably suspects that using Brendan Dassey as a prosecution witness would be disastrous and continues to try to make a criminal case against a defendant without the use of reliable or convincing evidenceand has no explanation for why the evidence was not found. But I can tell you one thing the evidence proves to me regardless of who killed Teresa Halbach even if it turns out it was Steven Avery she was not killed in Averys garage or trailer. ,SuperMaM,d9ossns,1,t5_3fkch

10164352,0,t3_5livja,using ubelee description of the scenario and my feeling of many others on the property having access to the locations evidence was found..it could have been..someone else on the property kills her. wants Avery to take the fall for it. LE finds the car on the property on the rd...you cannot discount the fact that the evening of the rd is when Colborn learned of TH and within minutes or even hours..calls in her plates. Those three things are just TOOOO coincidental.The pieces are all in place by whoever killed her but there was nothing as of Nov. th that directly connected Avery to her...which is why he was not in custody in Crivitz. MCSD needed something. They acquired the key..placed in his bedroom. They acquired a bullet from the property got DNA off an item of THs smeared it on the bullet..its put in the garage. Lenk knows his blood is in storage. The blood makes an appearance in the Rav. Everything else could easily have been left by anyone but these  things directly point at Avery. Blood bullet key in his room...all  Lenk had access to.So when you say its some huge gradiose elaborate scheme...Its not. One man could have done it...Colborn could be  innocent but I doubt it since he is so clearly lying about shaking the cabinet.

Since the bullets and casings were all allegedly collected on the property it would be not surprising to find they were fired from a gun found on the property.  Ticktock here are just once again hurling a bowl of pasta against the wall.Legitimate questions avoided by TickTock include.  Were the bullets fired from gun above Stevens bed or another gun on the property?.  Was the gun above Stevens bed there on the th and th?  On the th they did a consent search.  On the th Colborn took photographs inside the trailer  how come he neglected to photograph the guns in the bedroom?.  Was Teresa Halbach killed by a gunshot or was the gunshot post mortem after the police had seized the casings  allegedly in the garage..  Were the casings even in the garage?  Or were they collected elsewhere on the property?And of course the big one which TickTock will discuss.

10545030,0,t1_dd2z230,gtBD has NOT maintained his innocence.I think he has.  On the th November  he proved that if he told the truth but was then confronted by those in authority he would lie to please them thereby avoiding the confrontation.  That was the pattern of his subsequent interviews where he confessed to taking part in what was a murder a brutal murder by any standards.And yet despite the heinous murder and gruesome disposal of a body which was more akin with the acts of a serial killer he calmly asked what time he would be getting out as he needed to be at school to hand a project in.  That suggested he was a cold blooded psychopath with no sense of remorse for what he had done. That however is in stark contrast to the very reason they were apparently suspicious of him in the first place in that he had lost weight and appeared distant demonstrating the enormity of what he had done was playing on his mind.  Those two position are at complete odds with each other.Apart from the weight loss and appearing distant that was the only thing Kayla told investigators about Brendan.  The only time Kayla says he confessed to her was AFTER Brendan had apparently confessed to investigators and AFTER Kratzs infamous press conference.  Kaylas statement just repeated what Kratz had said but also expressed her hatred of Avery before he had stood trial proving she was incapable of the mental capacity needed to afford someone the presumption of innocence.So I dont think Brendan was ever confessing to the crime as we would recognise a confession he was just telling investigators what they wanted to hear even if that meant guessing.  Brendan even told OKelly who should have been there to help him that he had nothing to do with Teresas murder but OKelly calls him a liar so what does Brendan do?  He then goes along with OKellys story.  Someone at some point should have seen this pattern and realised Brendan simply went along with what he was told.  That could have been the investigators the prosecutors his defense Kachinsky or the court.  For some reason everyone chose to ignore the obvious which has left Dassey stuck in prison for  years without and real prospect of being released until .If Dasseys case was a stand along case in that he alone was being accused of murder with no forensic evidence just the fiasco of his confession I think anyone would find it inconceivably he was guilty.  However throw in the fact people think Avery is guilty so therefore Brendan must be you can then mentally ignore what happened to Brendan.On a final point although I could easily make twenty but a lot is made of Brendan confessing to him mom.  The problem is he didnt.  Investigators told him that Avery had burnt a body or cooked as they repulsively phrased it.  Now Brendan was told there was a fire on the Monday and as I said was told Avery had burnt a body in the fire pit that evening so as far as Brendan was concerned by helping collect wood etc. for the fire he had helped with the murder.  He was also told the stain cleaned up in the garage was the victims blood.  He took that coming from two mature police officers as a fact.  So he then thought unwittingly he had also help clean up the victims blood.  So when his mom asked if he did it he said some of it.  That was mistakenly taken as an admission of guilt.  If Avery is found to be innocent so by default so must Brendan be its virtually impossible for me to imagine how the state will be able to explain away Brendans interrogations and being charged with Halbachs murder. ,SuperMaM,dd3ealr,5,t5_3fkch

If truthers really took on board the true nature of SA  why would they cherish him as though he was such an illwronged person? I will provide the answer MAM minimised his true character and maximised the potential for a conspiracy theory. It is more entertaining that way.gt gt gt gt Your brain works in a strange way if you came off of MAM thinking he was guilty but after more research think he I would like to think of it as critical thinking. I am skeptical of anything I read or hear.In the documentary they mention he killed a cat in a fire I have been told time and time again that usually means a seriel killer sociopath and thats the impression I got. Also without further investigation MAM makes it sound like Dassey definitely knew something happened and he was somehow involved in the murder. Until reading more online and the case files I know now the coercion runs much deeper then MAM portrayed. There are other things obviously but this is the stuff that stands out most to me.Also the key... MAM showed us how shady it was who found all this evidence I was pretty sure of the planting but it wasnt until after it was proven that Colborn was lying about how he found the key due to reddit that it really solidified the planting theory for me. This alone makes all the evidence questionable especially anything that was found any time these two were around.,SuperMaM,ddwd6id,3,t5_3fkch

The fact that post secondary education exists secondary education is high school if you had half a brain I would not need to inform you of that  doesnt make it possible for someone to graduate from  high schools.  Groton Prep is a secondary school not primary grade school.  Choate is likewise a secondary school. You claimed you graduated from both which is impossible.gtI went to The Groton School in K. I went there. Look it up it is real.  The K school is a public school mental midget. That is not Groton Prep Groton Prep is a secondary school.  Groton Prep is where FDR went to school.  No presidents attended Groton public school not even FDR he was tutored.gtYou are not a lawyer and I question whether or not you actually passed the bar NYNJ as you claim due to the fact that my best friend is a DA in NYC and says youre full of shit. Basically you dont practice law because you cant.Your friend sounds imaginary but if he truly exists claims he can look up whether I am a member of the NY and NJ bars without my name then he is not a lawyer himself but rather as big a moron as you. gtIve given you ample opportunity to say anything of substance yet its all attacks.

You should change your name to dontknowjackshit that would be quite fitting.Lets recap your stupid claims and how they fell apartclaim   you graduated from the same high school as  presidents including JFK After I pointed out that Kennedy went to Choate and is the only president who went to Choate and in fact only  other presidents went to high school within several hundred miles of Choate you changed to claim claim  you went to middle school at Groton Prep and  presidents went to that school so that adds up to  My rebuttal Groton Prep is a high school jackass and FDR is the only president who attended it.  Which brings you to claim Claim  you went to Groton Prep from k gradeGroton Prep is not a k school only Groton public School is.  No presidents went to Groton Public school.

11138947,0,t1_detf8ma,gt Avery was  minutes from Schmitz even if one moves the time backwards and says she left Schmitz at  it still would be impossible for Avery to have arrived at Avery until . That renders Averys claim she arrived  and left  impossible. Try doing yourself a favor and actually applying your claims to see how they play out.gtgt Schmitz said she called him at  when in fact it was  so his reflection on time is proved to be unreliable. Funny considering nothing you write is reliable. He told police around  not .  His  approximate is not far off from the actual time of the call it was a pretty good estimate.  minutes off is not a big deal.That doesnt prove him wrong about the time she arrived. The time of the call is not something he would remember with precision he would be more apt to remember when she came and left than the phone call.  Once again though even if she left his house  not  it makes no difference that still leaves not enough time to get to Avery and there is no reason why she would skip Zipperer and go to Avery first.  Zipperer was on the WAY to Avery.  Plus the phone calls prove he went to Zipperer first.gtI will assume Teresa was at home but in her vehicle when she called Schmitz. As Teresa was young its a reasonable assumption she wouldnt necessarily stick rigidly to all speed limits. It was also a Monday afternoon so no rush hour traffic and she knew the roads. Knocking off  minutes for her first appointment that gave her  hour  minutes to get to Averys by pm so time to see Avery then call the Zipperers before she left Averys at pm.Making up such doesnt mean squat except that you choose to make things up. Lawyers dont provide evidence in court witnesses do and there are no witnesses or other evidence to support what you made up. You are the clown who said he was  minutes off so moving her visit back to leaving  is the best one can do. The way to try to do that would be to try getting the witness to change his claim and agree she could have arrived  and left .  If the witness denies it then you are screwed.  You are stuck with what the witness says. You dont get to make up what you feel like.  Your timeline would still would not give her enough time to get to Avery let alone to finish in time to be in her neighborhood at .  But you make up that she called at  while still at Averys.  Why would she drive past Zipper all the way to Avery first?  Worse still why would she call Zipperer from Averys and lie about being in her neighborhood but having trouble finding the house?  You never use your head you just make up stupid crap that makes no sense.  Here is how your stupidity would play out in court Ladies and gentlemen of the jury my name is Defense Attorney Mental Midget. You are going to hear evidence that proves Avery was the last stop of the day for Halbach.  I want you to disregard that evidence and believe my unsupported claim that she went there second and left and went to a different stop third.  All the evidence and witnesses will be wrong or lying thank you.  Evidence adduced at trialSchmitz She arrived  and was there for  minutesZipperer She arrived Evidence of the call to Zipperer proving she was looking for the Zipperer residence prior to  but having trouble finding it so called to try to get directions.  Since no one answered left a message saying she was having trouble finding it but would be there shortly Dawn At  spoke with Dawn and she indicated she was on her way to the Janda job.Bobby Around  he saw Teresa taking photos and go to towards Averys trailer and around  he left and her vehicle was still there. That was evidence from the actual trial.  If the defense made such a stupid claim on the basis of Avery then in addition the prosecution would have called a witness to discuss how Zipperer was closer to Schmitz than Avery and that the Zipperer residence would be reached before Avery therefore the logical path from Schmit would be to drive  minutes North to Zipperer and then another  minutes from zipperer to Avery. In addition the witness will be asked about the driving distance from Schmitz to Avery and how long it takes to do such drive and how it would be impossible to get there in time.  All of this evidence would prove the defense claim that she went to Avery second to be nonsense and Avery would be toast. gtSo  hour  minutes to travel  miles would be an average speed of MPH. Its also possible she drove from her home to Hilbert first to get a drink then called Schmitz thereby lowering her overall average speed. I knew this was possible already its just a shame you didnt also work it out. Now why would that be?All you did was ignore the evidence and make up a bunch of nonsense.,SuperMaM,deul70y,2,t5_3fkch

11188686,0,t1_df07jmp,Yeah I saw this part. I think I was looking more for what the cars in the area around the pond would typically be.Ive been to junkyards and there is often a system. Where they put a car might be based on factors like its current state. For instance cars near the pond might be cars that are ready to be stripped of parts you want to get rid of before crushing.So while they cover the specific crushing process I was hoping to learn a bit more about the higher level process. ie... first a car goes over here and we remove the wheels if they have value. Then it goes here to this section because its a ford. Once its been stripped out sufficiently by customers or we need room we move it over to this area which means its ready to be stripped to prepare for crushing.. etcI get the feeling this high level process didnt get discussed. But it could pinpoint what was done that didnt fit that process. As I said... if a given car was moved to the pond area that wasnt ready to be crushed that might indicate a change in process.

Colborn specifically concentrated his November th search of the bedroom to the bookshelf and desk spanning at least  minutes from  p.m. During the initial November th bookshelf search Colborn directly removed items from the bookshelf including handcuffs leg irons magazines and so on.  Lenk confirmed the bookshelf itself was searched on November th but couldnt recall whether or not all items were removed at that point. There exists no photographs of the bookshelf from before or after the November th search to compare. Lenk admitted he had no idea how the key with clasp ring and blue lanyard attachment could had been wedged into the back of the bookshelf unseen by all and without falling out. Colborn I tipped this to the side and twisted it away... I will be the first to admit I wasnt any too gentle as we were you know getting exasperated. I handled it rather roughly twisting it shaking it pulling it... that binder and some of the other things there were kind of stuffed rather forcefully back in there... Im sure it was looked under when it was tilted to the side... All of that tipping twisting shaking pulling and looking underneath the bookshelf while it was tilted to its side yet the physical placement of the bookshelf in relation to the wall was unchanged in the beforeafter photos as was the placement of the loose change and receipt on top. One has to believe that the same law enforcement group that made this mess during the trailer searcheswhich RJ explained was left in complete shambles with panel ripped off the wall busted toilet and sinks damaged and completely broken doors sliced up carpeting and couchwould still concern themselves with replacing the top contents of the bookshelf in a meticulous fashion. We have no photographic evidence that the bookshelf was ever displaced in the minutes before the key was first observed let alone to the extent required for the keys to land where they did despite Colborn explaining it was still kind of away from the wall when the key was found again the beforeafter show it to be in the same exact placement in relation to the paneling behind it.,SuperMaM,dfa053y,10,t5_3fkch

Whoever mutilates disfigures or dismembers a corpse with intent to conceal a crime or avoid apprehension prosecution or conviction for a crime is guilty of a Class F felony.The law doesnt define these terms so dictionary definitions govern.Dismemberdismembered dismemberingplay britransitive verb  to cut off or disjoin the limbs members or parts of  to break up or tear into piecesDisfiguretransitive verbto impair as in beauty by deep and persistent injuries a face disfigured by smallpox Mutilatetransitive verb  to cut up or alter radically so as to make imperfect the child mutilated the book with his scissors a painting mutilated by vandals  to cut off or permanently destroy a limb or essential part of   cripple His arm was mutilated in the accident.She was not dismembered in the common sense of it because that usually means cut up.

Why did he insist on listing it with AT and paying since his sister refused to pay and didnt want to sell it?Why didnt he call Halbach directly like he did for the  appointment?Why did he call that same day to arrange it instead of in advance? Why did he provide his sisters name address and phone number for the photographer to call to confirm whether she could make it that day or would not be able to until the following week full well knowing that his sister was not home and would not answer?Why didnt he at minimum give his own name as well and say he was paying and providing the ad because his sister was working?why didnt he call Halbach directly to ask if she was able to make it or not and instead call AT a second time pretending to be Barb?Why did he choose to keep it from Halbach that she was meeting him and thus force himself to keep watch for her for hours because if he missed seeing her then she would have taken the photos knocked on Jandas door called Jandas phone and then left. Why did he use  when calling her before she arrived to ask if she was still coming but not use it after she was dead? Why did he lie to Chuck saying she never showed?Why did he lie to police at first saying he didnt speak to her or interact with her and only knew she came by because he happened to see her through his window thus pretending he had nothing to do with arranging it?After his family was going to say he arranged the visit himself anyway so he came clean why did he still lie claiming his sister asked him to list it for her? When you consider these questions and try to answer the you must take into account the totality of the evidence including that on  Avery in a towel grossed he also left an image of a penis on his computer screen to try to see what her reaction would be to it though it is unclear whether she saw it or not  the evidence proving Avery shot her burned her body in his pit burned her electronics in his burn barrel and hid her vehicle.  When one looks at all of the the answer is clear he wanted to list the vehicle solely to get Halbach there.  He concealed his role either because Halbach was reluctant to meet him anymore and was avoiding him or with the intention to kill her from the outset in order to minimize his exposure as much as possible.
