2120747,0,t1_cl9c6go,I second everything youve said! Youve made great points about blogs  I dont mind blogs if its your personal blog or a quality review from another blog that might be lesser known and you do it in a selfpost and not in a way thats an obvious grab for clicks or page views. Great idea Also agree with POC. Im a POC and would love more discussions here about those types of things. For example none of the eyeshadows in the Naked  palette show up on me unless I use Milk so...its kind of pointless and frustrating for me to use it yet its everyones current favorite. Half of the Mega Pro shades would all look the same on me.Bashing peoples stuff is also unnecessary. Reading comments and having someone say something like ew I hate when people wear orange lipstick and...you like orange lipstick...that definitely can make someone feel bad especially with something as personal as your preference for lipstick color. Dont force that shit on others and insult them for not following your rules. They just seem like a place to be catty and mean without any real point.Im getting the same with the massive banner but I know the mods are currently working on it so Im excited to see it all fixed up!!,sugarfreemua,cl9e5ua,4,t5_340hb

2310609,0,t1_clx9snf,Bah if everyone does it it can hardly be costumey now can it? DBut in short I think probably not. You have a very round eye shape with brows that extend a little farther out from it and wings will help elongate your eyes. Youve got some wiggle room to play with wings girl! If your eyebrows ended much closer to the ends of your eyes it could get close to costumey but youd have to extend them pretty far to push into that territory.,sugarfreemua,clxb2dw,2,t5_340hb

2943993,0,t3_2tvodh,First off I think you have a good eye for picking lip colors  all of these look great on you!  My biggest piece of CC is that your foundation looks a bit powdery and obvious in a couple of these photos.  If youre going for a matte finish be sure to use a light touch when applying any setting powder andor matte foundation because its very easy to go a bit overboard and end up with a cakey look.  Your eyeliner application seems to be pretty good and you do a nice job of keeping your eyes even relative to each other but in a couple of photos it looks like your eyeliner doesnt quite come to the inner corners of your eyes.  Id suggest bringing in your eyeliner a bit further as it looks less abrupt in my opinion.  ,sugarfreemua,co2qubw,40,t5_340hb

2978176,0,t1_co5t0y8,You can use tape on the outer corner but I sometimes find this gives too harsh of an edge. I prefer to take a clean dry cotton bud and swipe it from the outer corner of my eye to the tip of my eyebrows as many times as necessary to give my eyeshadow the winged out effect or just look cleaner. As for the inner corners while I like the haziness I think this is a nice girly grungy type of look you can make it less hazy by not blending it out so far up or in towards the bridge of your nose or using a smaller blending brush. I really like this look. I like the pairing of blue brown with the dark pink nude lip the tones play well off each other. ,sugarfreemua,co6mui3,1,t5_340hb
2983660,0,t3_2ucr61,Your wings look great! Im jealous!It looks like maybe your contour is extended a little too far into the center of your face. I think the typical guideline is that it should stop around the same point as the outer corner of your eye. I think the placement and color is otherwise good just the line is too long. Also your brows look nice but the right brow left in photo seems to be filled in more at the start and its thicker than your other brow. You might want to try to get the inner portionsstart of the brows to match a little more in size and shape. ,sugarfreemua,co79545,1,t5_340hb

4093084,0,t1_crlxpbr,Im hesitant to recommend a specific resource because I dont think you should let a guide inhibit your creativity. I often find myself disagreeing with how to choose colours for your whatever  makeup tutorials because they are just too restrictive. Instead it is best to just experiment with looks and see what looks good to you.With all that being said a colour wheel can help you understand what colours are warm and what colours are cool. I would argue that red and green are both neutral colours and sometimes they can lean more towards being cool or being warm. When you choose colours for your look you can swipe them on the back of your hand first to see how they look close together. With practice youll develop a better eye for combining colours.  ,sugarfreemua,crmu4uv,1,t5_340hb

6210021,0,t1_cyuux4e,What producttechnique are you using? It almost looks like powder which is great to fill but easy to loose definition. If it is powder you can try experimenting with it wet if thats your preferred method. Line the bottom front of your brows  you may need to over draw to get them even  then lightly stroke the product from the bottom line to the top of your brows angling your brush to mimic your brow hair. Blend as desired  try experimenting with this as well and see how much definition you like for your looks. Line the outer parts of your arch and use the light stroke technique from top to bottom on the arch and end of your brow wherever you need more fullness and blend. Finally take some concealer highlighter or light eye shadow and somewhat thinly line underneath your brow to highlight it. Your brows are gorg though and have a great arch. Lining your brows and blending will help create more definition on where your brows start and end. Heres a video kind of showing what I explained ,sugarfreemua,cyviggt,1,t5_340hb

9731927,0,t3_5eifbj,I think that lipstick is seriously killer on you.  Gorgeous!  My only criticism is to maybe use either a clean eye shadow brush or use a color close to your skin tone to blend out your eye shadow a little more it ends a little abruptly and looks a little harsh. ,sugarfreemua,daco7v5,28,t5_340hb
9732416,0,t1_daco7v5,I agree the lipstick is great on you! I would also suggest blending the eye shadow at the crease and the corners and perhaps adding a little under your lower lash line for definition.,sugarfreemua,dacqdxb,9,t5_340hb
9908321,0,t1_dayllwx,Thank you! I normally just use some eyeshadow under my eyes but Ill try nixing that tomorrow and seeing if it looks better. I definitely need to play around with the brows more too!,sugarfreemua,daz2t5o,1,t5_340hb
9929150,0,t1_db12197,Ill definitely try this out. Smoking out the bottom lash line is something Im kinda worried to do because I feel like Ill give myself raccoon eyes. But you never can succeed if you dont even try!,sugarfreemua,db1skrg,3,t5_340hb
10115674,0,t1_dbq0nx9,This is such a good comment tysm. Im gonna look at all these suggestions more in depth when I get home from work. Im a bit wary of bb creams and the like cause I like a really long wearing foundation cause I cant touch it up during the day at work cause I work in a cafe and its too busy.,sugarfreemua,dbq2wk1,3,t5_340hb
10313029,0,t1_dccybty,I grabbed mine when they were on sale in a local store. I guess try googling them? The ones I use are like regular eyelash curlers but the rubber part gets warmed by batteries. There are also ones that are like a weird metal wand with a wire?,sugarfreemua,dcd1drm,2,t5_340hb

10545940,0,t1_dd3defk,No OP but If they naturally do that and it bothers you or youd like to try shaping them a little differently Id suggest you try get them done by a professional. They can at least give them a basic shape that you can keep up with by tweezing and stuff. And trust me if youre doing a major overhaul you do NOT want to tweeze the whole time. Ouch! Waxing is so much less painful and threading is a big thing now it seems too. Additionally people who do brows for a living tend to at least know what looks good in general so you dont accidentally overpluck or pluck in the wrong place. I think the main thing you could work on with your brows if you want to are the tails. The arch is there but I think the tails are too thick they dont taper as much as the ideal.If you dont mind the shape though its not a big deal theyre your brows!  Also since Im not OP I want to tell you that I think it looks really nice! That color looks surprisingly natural on you well compared to what it would look like on me. I think it has a lot to do with your colorind and of course the general aesthetic I see from just this picture. I cant really tell the lashes are blue unless I look closely but Im sure its more obvious in real life. The wing I think does look a little strange. It might be the combo of angle and width. ,sugarfreemua,dd3i0f4,4,t5_340hb
10563683,0,t3_5r8rdj,Your lipstick isnt a bad start! You have pretty clear skin with an even tone and some cute rosy cheeks! So you dont have to worry too much about foundation or concealer right now. What I would work on to start is eyebrows and mascara and some eyeshadow if youre feeling bold. Youd be surprised at how much of an improvement good brows and lashes can be over a plain face. Your lipstick looks a bit smudged on the bottom corners if anything but a lipliner can fix that as well as helping you practice having a steady hand. Id pick a more natural color for now but thats not a bad color on you. Any good brow tutorial or simple eye look tutorial will point you in the right direction!,sugarfreemua,dd5ih3j,4,t5_340hb
10642879,0,t3_5sanw6,When you watch tutorials of people doing their brows youll notice they shape the outside of them first generally starting with the bottom to give them structure. Draw a line along the bottom then the top then fill it in making it darker towards the outer corners. Dont fill in that inner half inch too much instead use vertical strokes to imitate real hairs. You want to cover your hair with the pencil so plucking the strays or having them waxed helps give them that polished look.,sugarfreemua,dddqcb3,1,t5_340hb
10870524,0,t1_de16llj,ty very much! I recently tried my first halo eye its such a beautiful eyeshadow look but I have to practice WAY more! D thanks for the suggestion! Ill practice. ,sugarfreemua,de17tq5,4,t5_340hb

11222637,0,t3_5z2ae8,i also use the dewy and smooth to set my face every day. ive hit pan! but like you i use a loose powdercoty airspun under the eyes and where my smile lines crease. i tend to just go over the areas ive used that with the glowy powder and use it not only as a setting powder but as a finishing powder. sorry if youve tried this! good luck!!,sugarfreemua,df42lqj,1,t5_340hb
11284579,0,t1_dfb1wxq,Thank you for responding! I love my wings but its probably because Im insecure about my eye size. I feel like theyre really small and try to...extend them i guess? Also do you have tips on tightlining without twitchingfreaking yourself out? Ive tried to tightline but my eyes water when i try to do so. Actually i kind of avoid my bottom lid all together. I suppose its more sensitive than the rest of mt eye?,sugarfreemua,dfb39fe,4,t5_340hb
11461024,0,t3_62yfwc,This is a great natural look for you. If I have one critique it is that I would add a little bit to the eyes but I wouldnt go darker  Id add a shade a touch lighter than your skin with a bit of a shimmer so something thats not quite light enough to work as a highlighter on you right in the middle of the eyelid just a bit of light behind the lashes. Speaking of which how do you feel about curling your eyelashes? That would really give some natural oomph.,sugarfreemua,dfv3loh,1,t5_340hb
11462769,0,t1_dfs2bk5,Yeah I was thinking of taupe or something similar in place of the orange shadow. It could help the red accents pop even more. I think it would also help with your blending concerns because the colors would be more similar. Hope that helps!,sugarfreemua,dfvaq91,2,t5_340hb
11579919,0,t3_6595lc,Your skinmakeup looks good for being new to makeup. In case you didnt know already you have hooded eyes I have one eye thats half hooded and wish Id known sooner haha and rhoodedeyes is a great resource for eye makeup tips.
