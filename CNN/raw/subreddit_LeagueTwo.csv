229761,0,t1_cf4igd4,Your first shot anywhere near the target and you score grr. As for the second one Im still trying to work out why our CB Will Antwi looked like he was running through custard and let your man reach a ball that seemingly he never should of...,LeagueTwo,cf4k9av,3,t5_2wn55
577358,0,t1_cg5w9xx,Possibly but it would still get the club out of the fine and everything so it doesnt explain why they would want to suddenly change their mind...,LeagueTwo,cg5weod,2,t5_2wn55

805754,0,t3_23cs0d,Shame for the Stags with that last minute Accrington penalty.A win would have kept us in with an outside chance of a playoff place and something to play for in the last three games.Hopefully they will keep up the good form even though the last games mean very little as we are mathematically safe.I still think that a tophalf finish would be amazing though after the horrendous run we went on over the winter I would certainly deem the season a success overall.  ,LeagueTwo,cgvv9ga,3,t5_2wn55
826407,0,t3_23lj03,We didnt play particularly well but all that mattered was getting the  points and we did and unless we seriously fuck up were safely in the playoffs and for the first time ever I am actually confident we could win them. Onwards and upwards!,LeagueTwo,cgy7ppr,3,t5_2wn55
877764,0,t1_ch3jira,No worries Ill be checking your results and hoping you get the right ones like I said you always pack your allocation so Im hoping youll stay up with Torquay down we need our local derbies. What was this safety officer fiasco I missed that?,LeagueTwo,ch4203j,3,t5_2wn55
1830228,0,t3_2fj4m4,This is great but I cant stand how theyre mixing gambling with news.  isnt even great odds for the relegation favourites to get  points from  games.,LeagueTwo,ck9qhfr,2,t5_2wn55
