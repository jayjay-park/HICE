Koresh Jones Manson Ti and Do...Aldi.Quick question I just watched Ben Bailey being pushed around the store in a cart which I assume to be some sort of fertility rite. Is he an official ambassador the Tom Cruise of Aldiology? Or an unwitting pawn in the mission to bring sacrificially low prices to the masses?,GroceryStores,cv32b4e,3,t5_2tztq

Youll have canned vegetables dog food and cake mix on the same pallet for example. Also our store is open hrs so customers would probably be annoyed by pallets blocking aisles. It would be way more efficient if we could bring out full pallets though.,GroceryStores,dexobqy,1,t5_2tztq
