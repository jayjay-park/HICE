9658476,0,t1_da3hlf4,Ill explain a very dumbed down versionOk so a quick breakdown of hashes. In computing a hash is used to verify that a files integrity hasnt been compromised that it is not altered. Basically the computer runs a math algorithm through the data of a file the s and s that make up all data on a computer and generates a hash. The algorithm will generate unique hashes based on the file that is hashed. No two files will produce the same hash. Also the algorithm used to generate the hash is the same between anyone using the same hashing schema. The algorithm math problem that creates the hash is not a secret both parties will use the same algorithm the data of the file however is. This is useful in computing because anyone can take a file and generate the corresponding hash and compare that the hash matches. If it matches it proves the data is the same between the two people who hashed it. Even a incredibly small alteration in the data will completely change the hash that is produced.For the current situation people myself included are worried because wikileaks is claiming that the hash they released is for the data after its been UNENCRYPTED. After encrypting the files the way wikileaks has its basically scrambled the s and s. Attempting to hash the encrypted file will not yield the hash of the unencrypted file. Basically the hashes are useless for us.As an aside the encrypted files that WL has released are VERY strongly encrypted. They are impossible to decrypt without the associated key. Even super computers would take retarded long amounts of time think s of years to guess the correct key.The ONLY reason one can possibly make for posting the hashes is that its to prove to someone that they have the files. But who can possibly know if the hashes in the messages are legitimate? The answer Anyone who has the data unencrypted FBI CIA NSA etc.. They can hash their copy of the files and realize that the hash is the same as the files they have. For PGP keys PGP keys are a type of encryption called asymmetric key encryption. What this means is that when using PGP you generate a set of two keys. The key you keep is called the private key. The key you give to others is called the public key. Basically anything encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted by the public key. Also anything encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. WL has released the public key to the public while the private key remains hidden. This means that we can verify if something is actually from WL when they use the private key to encrypt it since the public key will decrypt it correctly. Using a computer to guess the private key with the public key is basically impossible. Its confusing to explain so just understand that you cant hack the private key when you have only the public key. This is how PGP is used to authenticate that a message is authentic. WL not using the PGP keys is very strange.The weaknesses of PGP is essentially keeping the private key safe. If someone steals it through hacking or other methods they can basically pretend to be you and nobody would be the wiser. Also you need to be able to trust that when you receive the public key the first time it actually came from who it was supposed to.

The disinfo is that posesta brothers are involved with the kidnap of Maddie when in fact she died in the apartment.

Question is howwhy did they release the photos when at the time podesta bros were not even in the frame for any criminal activity.  Was this an inside shot across the bow a warning to poedta bros.

They reported that she was setting up a trust and wanted to get advice from him. Her foundation raises money mostly for animal welfare organizations but also raises money for the Free Assange campaign.  The article says that Vivienne Westwood who knows Anderson from a bunch of fashion work they did together and who is a longtime JAWL supporter said that she was going to introduce the two of them but the plans fell through so Anderson went on her own. Certainly more plausible than anything else speculated about here. People seem to think of PA only in strictly sexualized terms rather than seeing her as a full person with other things going on including her charity work and political activism.

How did you even miss the fact that snipets of it were shown as promos a day before at least? You cant show snippets of something unless it has been recorded first that recording is called pre recorded. Any  interview is live at the time it is recorded.

10220355,0,t1_dc2fkdk,The key word here is conceptually. From a philosophical i.e. not legal standpoint free speech is an ideal for which there are quite literally no limits on speech. In legal reality there are many actual constraints on this. A big one is copyright legislation. Another is defamation legislation.I feel it is important to present these constraints in the philosophical context to better understand and  or appreciate the limitations and whether or not one would agree that such limitations are just. Like almost everything in law compromises must be made because the world is not as objectively rational as our tendencies toward logic would suggest.The constitution presents a framework for which matters of law can be settled with a context that provides support for various ideals  ideals which can almost never be entirely achieved as it wouldnt take long to find immediate contradictions. Imagine a visceral example of free speech as allowing someone to scream at the top of their lungs into the ears of any passerby. If this happens somewhere you can be sure that individual could and most likely would be arrested.Im not arguing that free speech in its philosophically pure form has ever existed. Im just saying that the laws that fall under defamation are inherently in conflict with the concept of free speech and that much of the legislation written for slander and libel has its scope limited by free speech.Many people forget that the first amendment is not free speech. It merely protects many forms of free speech by prohibiting congress from passing laws that would jeopardize it. Free speech itself isnt a law it is a concept.,WhereIsAssange,dc2j9ah,1,t5_3h5f3

So he is spreading what you consider misinformation. His misinformation may well be used by others to disinform. He may have come to this conclusion by his own observations which was also backed up by videos he had seen but he is not as far as I can see being an agent of disinformation. The video or is it videos? on YouTube you talk about are they specifically designed to attack and discredit Wikleaks or are they also observations from those who have a problem with the evidence as presented? You seem very sure. Do you have verifiable information that this is the case that it is a definite attempted to attack and discredit and not just a point of view? So you know for sure  that they were in the same room. I think you are possibly right yet when I watched the video my first impression was that they were not in the same room.

I understand the air of caution on the videos. I go around applying the science and IT to some of the more obvious claims. The blinking is actually normal if you look at previous interviews with Julian. The Hannity interview has an overarching shot of both people and I worked out the likely camera angles Julian and Hannity in this photo. The Piliger interview was definitely strange for editing and what really had me jump on board with all of this. However as was pointed out a few times its likely a new technique used to reduce pauses in videos. It totally looked weird and didnt help with the Proof of Life claims everyone asked for. The green screen he used for the AMA has been used in the past as well the timing of the AMA and Hannity interview contribute to further proof of life. Hannity showed location and the AMA showed currency. If you have anything more worth pointing out in the videos Id be happy to help explain them.,WhereIsAssange,dd066qa,2,t5_3h5f3
10517491,0,t3_5q78r8,Great refutation of the bullshit that is spread thickly like nutella. Of course they will dismiss this under the accusation that youre shutting down lines of discussion youre not or trying to claim everything is fine youre not because kit is obviously not fine but youll never convince them to stop. Best you hope for is that they get bored and move elsewhere.,WhereIsAssange,dd09rdl,3,t5_3h5f3

10644730,0,t1_dddr27r,Im pretty tired of the WL helped influence American politics thing. They published factual information on the DNC being corrupt. No dip that influenced america... as it should have. Even if Hitler released that info we would owe him a thank you. As far as wikileaks and the RNC they published info on sarah palin when she was on the POTUS ticket. Donald trump doesnt use email and without emails think about what wiki would have on the dnc?  Basically nothing.  HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH,WhereIsAssange,dddx7fm,10,t5_3h5f3
10660917,0,t1_ddfjbv3,How does this video not show enough location for you? The embassy is surely not a place just anyone could walk into and there would be a LOT of people who would know if he really wasnt there. Youre trying to say that there are hundreds of people if not more that are in on the fact that Julian is NOT inside the embassy? That there is No evidence he is there and yet you have No evidence he isnt there.,WhereIsAssange,ddflcb5,2,t5_3h5f3
10725435,0,t3_5tc9wz,I agree I doubt it is about  but why try to force the FBI to reveal they have the emails when Wikileaks could just simply publish it themselves and be done with the matter? Interesting analysis thanks for sharing.,WhereIsAssange,ddm8ytl,4,t5_3h5f3

10767679,0,t3_5u14c8,Having lurked here for a while I truly think that whats happened is that JA is alive but not well. Either his tech is under the control of the govt or he is forced for whatever reason to do their bidding. Idk how we get out of that situation JA perpetually neutered by threats on his life and those he loves unreliable leaks and a DMS that apparently was thwarted by the PTB. I mean if he is OK and the deniers are crazy then... what the fuck is he doing? This twitter acct is just another example of totally baffling decisions JA makes given the lack of trust still surrounding his agency.,WhereIsAssange,ddqlu64,22,t5_3h5f3
10879936,0,t3_5vfb4d,Amazing to see all the people making comments buying into the Trump is working with Russia narrative. Theres more evidence for Julian having worked for Russia simply because there is substantiated conversations through his lawyers and a rd party group trying to frame him for being a pedo and working with Russia.  Congrats to all you people in a whereisassange sub buying into the same propaganda narrative by the same parties that pushed it on Assange. Get a fucking clue. ,WhereIsAssange,de26rrv,15,t5_3h5f3

10925006,0,t3_5w25pc,Yknow Im out of here after that image. I used to think Assange was doing something worthy around transparency. Turns out hes a useful idiot who has been only about his own importance. Any value in wikileaks has been subsumed into Assanges ego. Hes become a useful stooge of dangerous forces and hes massively damaged anything positive behind him through his naivety. Now this image shows up. These troll play nazis are victims? FFS. Poor multimillionmaking victims being held accountable for their behaviour. Fascist snowflakes are the whiniest most pathetic snowflakes. ,WhereIsAssange,de6u6mk,-41,t5_3h5f3
10936687,0,t1_de7zsxp,That was a set of questions they wouldnt allow and the main one. There were others such as why the moderators and their behavior changed so much why there was a sudden influx of astroturfing and concern trolling etc. This sub was inherently skeptical but concerned with Julians safety primarily. However its worth nothing that what called his safety into question was the perception that the other sub and the official twitter had been compromised plus strange geopolitical actions.,WhereIsAssange,de81jko,6,t5_3h5f3
11153994,0,t1_dew523d,This is a relatively small price to pay to rebuild peoples confidence in Wikileaks in order to reap the benefits of roping up more whistleblowers more hackers more people involved in clandestine activities. The whole thing reeks of bait.,WhereIsAssange,dewakqt,2,t5_3h5f3
