8571301,0,t3_4wp2ah,. I was sort of confused by this I kind of assumed it was a shot at hunky gym bros given Charls handsome little facebod but I think it works on another level too. I could see it as a satire of a lot of the people over at the MDE sub who think they are alphas for lifting when in reality they most likely have shit form and look like fuckin ogres. Im just thinking this because of the little ridiculous wig Charls had on which made him into a clown. On the other hand I think it is criticizing the more hardcore lifters who abuse the juice to get shredded given Charls quickness to inject himself with some meds for his back pain. Really liked it though and it made me quite uncomfortable.. For this one I posted a thought I had over on the MDE sub which was Or maybe its about how people in authority positions allow bad people to go unchecked  IE bad cops scummy politicians shady businessmen  because these bad persons help keep other people in check like for example the bully was sent by the black principal Vice Principal? to pick on the smart black student because in her eyes he is potential competition as a black person who beat the status quo. . Not much new on my end I thought the ending was pretty telling. In societies eyes women are into sex for the emotional aspect while men are into it to bust a nut although I like what you and some other users are saying here. I also loved the hyper aggressive cop and maybe its referencing how some police power trip and go absolutely nuts over the small stuff including killing people.The end song was kind of a sigh of relief for me honestly stuff like that makes me question this women degrading image that their fan base seems to want to build up for them. Although a lot of MDE fans probably dont realize how asinine they sound I used to be the same way until I started forcing myself to socialize to get over a serious bout of depression I was going through. I only hope they get over it because it seems a lot of users are smart and could be very productive members of society. end rantAnother thing I really loved was the intro it really had an Internety vibe to it and I feel like it really establishes their aesthetic and feel ,worldpeace,d6czt3b,3,t5_2qtgg
