52195,0,t1_cejk03b,I dont think you are at all being a dick but I do think you may have missed my point. Im not saying that the No campaign has no room for any positive speech but rather that they will always have to be a pessimisticrealistic reflection of a more optimistic Yes campaign.The Yes campaign has much greater freedom for optimism. There are simply much higher stakes involved with independence and so the greatest possible gains are going to inevitably be higher. An independent Scotland is a just significantly larger magnitude of change and that change as far as any person can be a certain could go in either direction. So lets imagine for a moment that both sides plans will work out in the best possible fashion. It is easy to see that independence is going to be the more compelling sell since the possibilities of independence are much larger. This means that the No campaign will always have to frame their arguments in terms of casting doubt on the Yes campaigns claims since on strict upsides they simply cannot rival the possibilities. Again this inevitably makes them seem the pessimists.Im trying to think of a simple example and I think perhaps gambling is the easiest.Imagine that there are two games you can play and for both if you win you will double your bet. You dont know the actual odds of winning for either game. The first game asks you to put  pounds into the pot the second asks you to put in . Now if you are a strict optimist and only focus on the potential upsides of each game then the obvious answer is that you should play the second game. After all the upside is more than  times as large. In fact logically the only way that anyone could ever get you to play the first game is by making you focus on the possible downsides or losses you might incur. True the lesser gamble can also be slightly optimistic in suggesting you might win  pounds. Essentially though their only possible strategy to make you play their game is to somehow reduce your optimism for the second game to temper it with either reality or pessimism such that you are sufficiently afraid of losing  pounds that you decide to take the smaller risk.When the other side is harping on how great it would be if you had a  more pounds the lesser game simply can never win your confidence by only trying to make you excited about the possibility of winning  pounds. They absolutely have to by the necessity of their position insert doubt into the equation.edit wording for clarity.,Scotland,cekdfc1,2,t5_2qkli

82266,0,t3_1v0vjb,gtIt followed claims by nationalists that Sir Chris Hoy the sixtime Olympic cycling champion was a traitor to his country for warning that independence could harm Scottish sport because Scotland currently lacked the resources to recreate Britains success at s London Games.I certainly wouldnt call Hoy a traitor but I might call him a bit dim. Scotland only lacks the resources because there has been  insubstantial investment by the UK government. This would presumably change in an independent Scotland if it was felt to be a priority.

263000,0,t1_cf7zv42,Im sorry but I cant take you seriously if youre going to cite the Russian revolution as an example to follow. Not only did it cause millions of deaths through civil war and the Cheka as soon as the small group of industrial workers gained power they locked out the peasants who their revolt was built upon. Not to mention the fact that long term it resulted in the leadership of Stalin. I genuinely cant tell if youre joking or not. You cant just pick and chose where our money goes its all government funds. Its easy to spin it like that but I could just as easily say Scottish taxes go to disability benefits in Wales and aid to refugees from Syria. Do you want to take that away? Just because we take away our contribution doesnt mean that funds would stop being misused wed be hurting the underprivileged not the upper classes. I highly doubt most people in Birmingham care whether we vote yes and I think its absolutely ridiculous that youre implying it would spur some sort of industrial revolt. Its great that you would support an independent Scotland to do that but I dont trust politicians in Holyrood any more than I trust politicians in Westminster.

293733,0,t3_1xfexg,Not sure why the Nationalists are getting all excited about this. If you want Independence some form of Border Controls should be seen a tangible expression of Nationhood.... The US  Canada border photo is totally misleading in that you cant actually cross the border there and trying to will get you arrested very quickly.These are the signs that are just out of shot.This is what the US  Canadian border typically looks like. Similarly this is a typical Russia  Poland border. Just because there are places where the security is more lax doesnt mean there are no border controls. In all the other photos there are no border controls because the two countries share a policy on customs  immigration to such an extent that such controls would be unneccessary. In contrast one of the reasons often cited for Independence is that Scotland and England have completely different needs in relation to immigration. As such one of the benefits of Independence would be Scotland adopting a far more open immigration policy than England in line with our needs. If that happens theres every chance that border controls will be put in place  otherwise England would be subject to our immigration policy as opposed to theirs. Ultimately Border controls might be unlikely if RUK stays in the EU  but Salmond et al. simply cannot tell us they wont happen since like so many elements in play he doesnt get to decide. The RUK does. ,Scotland,cfb7lgf,18,t5_2qkli

353655,0,t3_1y537u,Sure its more straightforward than you might imagine..The first thing that you need to know is that the domestic law that created the UK is irrelevant to the international law that deals with Scotland breaking away.International law with respect to the succession of states is only really concerned with  things population and landmass.When one part of a state breaks away the remainder can continue to be recognised as the continuing state if it comprises the majority of the landmass and the majority of the population.So for example  When the Soviet Union broke up the Russian Federation was recognised as the continuing state because it still had the vast majority of the population and landmass of the USSR. When Yugoslavia broke up nobody was recognised as the continuing state because nobody had over  of the population or landmass. When Pakistan broke away from India what remained of India was recognised as the continuing state because it had the majority of the landmass and population. Also when Ireland broke away from the UK the UK was the continuing state. It just changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Nothern Ireland but it wasnt a new state.And thats it really.So if Scotland was to break away because what remained of the UK would still comprise the vast majority of the population around  and the majority of the landmass around  it can continue to be recognised as the UK. ,Scotland,cfhf96v,22,t5_2qkli

Most rental cars are stickshift manual because thats what most people who take a driving test take the test on  if you test on an automatic transmission you can only legally drive automatics. Automatic rentals are available but you need to ask for one in advance to be sure of getting one and theyre usually larger pricier cars.. Check in advance that driving licenses issued by your country are acceptable for vehicle hire in the UK. Not all of them are the UK has a very high driving test standard.. ID requirements for renting a vehicle in the UK are in my experience tighter than they are in the USA  expect to be asked to show a driving license and a passport as well as giving a credit card..

With a currency union theres some insulation  but then the amount of borrowing which iScotland could do would be decided elsewhere. Of course this leads to the question of whether you think that debt is a good thing or not. I dont.

1032196,0,t1_chl95ki,It is difficult to argue with such a fundamentally different perspective. Even if we accept that Thatcherism has had some massively deleterious affect on the country  something highly dicey in itself  im not sure there us anything to propose to make it better.Unemployment was smaller in the s because we happily sent people down pits and into horrible manufacturing jobs  these jobs may have disappeared during the era of Thatcherism but the reason they have gone is more fundamental than that. We just dont need to employ hundreds of thousands of miners anymore and automation in a modern factory is incredible and only going to get better.Given the Greens hatred of coal and spartan attitude to consumption im not sure why you think theyd have saved all those jobs. Those jobs are gone because of deeper structural reasons than Thatcherism.Manufacturing as a proportion of UK GDP has remained unchanged since forever. But the employment demand of manufacturing has decreased massively. Besides which I dont find the greens even slightly believable. A mantra of we must live in harmony with nature is nonsense. We dont and never have lived in harmony with nature. We overcome and conquer it. We happily lay waste to woodland so we can have agriculture and cities we aggressively eliminate diseases we consume available resources then develop new technologies that allow the consumption of hitherto unknown resources. The history of humanity has fundamentally been about rejecting any balance with nature since we first started sparking up fires.And of course we have an absolutely huge and massively rapidly expanding renewables sector despite the ravages of Thatcherism. ,Scotland,chlm669,2,t5_2qkli

Were not losing much of a voice when we never had one anyway. With or without a currency union our economies are about as similar as you can get. their interest rates will be fine for the forseeable future. Although I do think we should aim to either have our own Scottish pound in  or  years. or more. Or we could join the Euro if it looks favourable. . Scotland will be on a similar path to Norway maybe not quite as rich as them but we both have export led economies which lead to a strong currency. We wont be defaulting on any debts. theyre not our debts as has been made clear by earlier statements by the bank of England on this matter. If the politicians really were so stupid as to refuse to allow us to take our share of the debt then thats a political decision which the debt markets will discount as a oneoff event. It doesnt impact on our ability to repay investors which is all they care about. The end result of which is that we come away with no debt. Just read the advice of the  Nobel prize winning economists who have made statements this week. Professor Joseph Stiglitz and Sir James Mirrlees. Ill dig out links for you in a minute. The euro is a nonissue. theyll let us do whatever we want in order to keep us as members. Cameron has already made enough enemies to ensure theyre on our side  In fact Jean Claude Junker was very quick to reassure people in Scotland that we would be given a special fast track entry procedure. we already comply with everything so the normal procedure for entry is nonsensical.Linksskip to  if you want to skip the stuff about european banks. but I found it interesting nonetheless.I hope this answers your concerns.,Scotland,ck0ey12,9,t5_2qkli

1815993,0,t3_2fcdjz,On the votes not counting issue  I cannot see how its not a justifiable claim its not just an issue of who wins and what that means in terms of policy but it includes the policies themselves and the parties that create them. It includes the serious flaw in the first past the post voting system and a majority ruled legislature.Is Independence a risk? of course. It is a serious one? Well thats debatable. Its highly unlikely its going to be some kind of huge disaster nor its it even likely it could be a reasonably disaster. Most likely its going to pretty much the same maybe a little bettermaybe a little worse  but broadly similar. So why bother? Maybe Im too pessimistic but staying part of the UK is staying on a road that is going somewhere bad. I see basically no positive trends nor do I see any realistic paths to change that. Now a lot of this is global stuff the broad economy in particular  which maybe you have a little chance of changing within the UK but its still probably too small to make any real difference which an independent government couldnt do a lot about even if it wanted to. But some of it isnt  GCHQ war on terror civil liberties equality etc. When you take a step back reduce the stakes and take a chance to breath maybe change will actually be possible. Regardless of what your particular pet issues are discussing them with people who in broad terms have similar world views and convincing them that something should be different and only having to convince a couple hundred thousand that its true maybe something could actually happen.   Im not naive like I said its likely to be pretty similar. But right now and I dont think its hyperbole to say that the only thing that gives me any sort of hope of a positive political future is independence.

1839674,0,t1_ckauw41,Ok Let me clarify here. These are two different issues.UN Security council permanent seats wield an incredible amount of power and just want you guys to understand leaving means giving it up to rUK and any internal influence Scotland has upon it. As a resurgent Russia has shown us you should not leave your security in other peoples hands. Also unrelatedly I hear France has two Mistral amphibious assault ships for sale and you should probably consider buying one and making it your flagship. Gives you a bit of soft power humanitarian aid deliverance and a bit of hard power too.EU economic policy is set by the French and the Germans. In general these policies tends to mostly benefit those states and those close to them to the detriment of the more southern states and others on the periphery. Ireland Malta Italy and Greece have all felt this to varying degrees.If you do go independent you should be wary of using either the Pound or the Euro in the long term because of the ties and restrictions it will put upon you will not always be in your interests and you have little control over them. It can potentially set the future of your country back generations.I am not saying these are reasons on their own to vote no I am just saying to make the right choices for your country and if that is a yes and the vote swings your way to not be naive to have your eyes open to not put up with bullshit that will wreck you country if not immediately then potentially    years down the line when it is too late to correct your course.,Scotland,ckavl7k,1,t5_2qkli

Sometimes sounds may be elided for euphonic effect.gtIn Native English elision comes naturally and it is often described as slurred or muted. Often elision is deliberate. It is a common misconception that contractions automatically qualify as elided words which comes from slack definitions. Not all elided words are contractions and not all contractions are elided words for example going to  gonna an elision that is not a contraction can not  cannot a contraction that is not an elision.gtIn French elision is mandatory in certain contexts as in the clause Cest la vie elided from a est la vie  Ce est la vie.gtIn Spanish elision occurs less frequently but is common in certain dialects. It is never marked by an apostrophe in writing. Of particular interest is the word para which becomes pa. Multiple words can be elided together as in pa trabajar for para trabajar and pa delante or even pa lante for para adelante.gtAn example of deliberate elision occurs in Latin poetry as a stylistic device Under certain circumstances such as one word ending in a vowel and the following word beginning in a vowel the words may be elided together. Elision was a common device in the works of Catullus For example the opening line of Catullus  is Lugete O Veneres Cupidinesque but would be read as Lugeto Veneres Cupidinesque.gtA synonym for elision is syncope though the latter term is most often associated with the elision of vowels between consonants e.g. Latin tabula  Spanish tabla. Another form of elision is apheresis which means elision at the beginning of a word generally of an unstressed vowel.gtSome morphemes take the form of elision see disfixgtThe opposite of elision is epenthesis whereby sounds are inserted into a word to ease pronunciation.gtA special form of elision called ecthlipsis from Greek  is used in Latin poetry when a word ending in the letter m is followed by a word beginning with a vowel e.g. ...et mutam nequiquam adloquerer cinerem  ...et mutam nequiquadloquerer cinerem Catullus .gtThe omission of a word from a phrase or sentence is not elision but ellipsis or elliptical constructiongtInteresting ELISION Ensemble | Elision French | Copy elision | Reinterpretation Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckgbqrw oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckgbqrw.

Is there a general consensus over which way the undecided might vote on the day? All we hear is that theyre far more likely to vote No but to be honest Im not sure thats something to rely on because I feel as though voters a far more likely to vote positively on the day if they still havent made their mind up.

In order to to make it worth while for companys in Scotland to invest in renewable energy and build wind turbines etc the UK government guaranteed to pay a price way over the going market rate for electricity created from renewable sources.This subsidy comes from UK as a whole and is added to everyones electricity bill even though most of the renewable production is based in Scotland.If Scotland becomes independent rUK will no longer subsidise renewable energy in Scotland and Scotland will have two options a large hike in energy prices for Scotland to make up for the loss of  of the people contributing to the scheme or abandon the scheme entirely which would likely kill the renewable sector in Scotland as it would no longer be a profitable way to produce energy and companys cant operate at a loss.Regardless of the party in power after independence they will be forced to pick one of these options or cut money from other services to make up the short fall.,Scotland,ckkty2e,2,t5_2qkli

1936497,0,t1_ckmha62,Options British pound in currency union that considers Scottish interests has the Bank of England acting as lender of last resort for Scottish banks etc.  Problem the UK would demand tight constraints on Scottish policy.  Query why bother seceding?  Problem the euro shows us that US economists were right and this is actually a bad situation to be the smaller partner in.  Immediate problem UK said haha no. Just use British pounds.  Totally doable  various countries use the US dollar or the euro in lieu of their own currency.  This is because theyve failed at governing themselves or for Gaza perhaps dont have a sovereign to begin with.  Problem you dont have any lender of last resort or control over monetary policy like how big your money supply is.  Economy is acutely sensitive to balance of payments and tips into austerityrecession if pounds flow out.  Its a lot like being on the gold standard.Keynesian intermission think of money as like lubricating oil in an engine you need a certain amount to keep things going stably.  If you have too much then your engine floods inflation but if you dont have enough then the engine seizes up and stops working at all depression. In the world of frictionless spherical cows prices would drop to match a reduced money supply in the real world prices are sticky downward and dont.  The ability of a sovereign to simply print money has proven crucial to keeping modern economies running on an even keel.  Yes you can overdo it but they mostly dont unless things are falling apart already for other reasons. Have own currency but peg it to the pound.  This has the same immediate drawbacks of  and may require more work plus leaves you open to attack by speculators like Soros driving the UK out of the ERM if they think your exchange rate is unjustified or that you havent backed your currency conversely building up a supply of British pounds to back your currency can mean big austerity especially if youre already running deficits.  Benefits you get shortterm exchange rate stability and the freedom to float when you need to later.  Also AIUI Scottish banks have already been printing their own banknotes though fully backed by a supply of British pounds so this would be easier to implement than Greece leaving the euro. Own currency float to begin with.  Benefits exchange rate adjusts to suit your economy for me this would have been the single biggest potential benefit of independence.  Problem bank accounts and debts are currently in British pounds and handling transition can be tricky.  If you try to force conversion capital flees if you dont then Scots find themselves with foreign debt in pounds while earning in a probably depreciating currency.Best options would have been  or .  I dont think any would have been painless far as I can tell Scotlands been getting money from the UK so independence would mean being poorer straight off and I dont know that the export boom from a falling currency would make up for that quickly.  And Scotland already gets much of the oil money so getting the UKs share wouldnt help that much and oil production is falling like a stone anyway.,Scotland,ckmjek2,10,t5_2qkli

I dont really see it as being an abuse of the button but a reflection of peoples feelings about how the person has contributed and if they have contributed a strong argument.Its less about the system and more about the demographics that are exposed to the content. Ill even admit it is sometimes an echo chamber in here but the opposition in the debates is really weak you do get the exceptions though but through the indyref you got people recycling arguments debunked ages ago. It can get really annoying.Sometimes it feels like some people come here to troll spouting misguided daily mail rhetoric without any facts and unable to have a debate.

It wasnt our choice.  I agree it could have been handled better in some parts of the uk.  the midlands of england suffered terribly for example.the UK does well as a services base economy.  Explain to me how the Uk is meant to compete in large scale industry against huge countries in the st century?  the Uk needs to focus on small scale luxury goods.  Using its engineering expertise in consultancy rather than digging things out the ground or making things in factories.THere are tories  in the north as there are in the south.But despite all that  there are many elements of us vs. them.

They voted down a living wage for public sector contracts decimated college places and havent introduced a single progressively redistributive policy in  years.

Im so sick of hearing the tories brought up as if they are a shower of bogeymen over the hill. The tories I hate arent people who are members of the Conservative Party they are policies of low regulation low pay amp minimal state intervention  ie the policies Scotland WOULD have had to follow upon independence just like every other small fringe eu state has had to. Im glad to hear that you want a reformed labour party. I think were in a state too. Trade union rights are a mess worker organisation is a shell of its former self and problems that ought to be understood as socialclass based are being seen as nation based in Scotland as well as England. If you want a better labour party now more than ever is your opportunity to make a mark on a CLP and make that change happen.

The SNP dont want to implement anything in the UK and have never claimed so. They are only interested in Scotland and the cultural influences therein that effect its peoples political needs. There currently is a government seat in a foreign nation which is interfering with Scotlands politics Not the other way round. And Scotlands people never called for it. Even back when the Union was formed. And remember its a Union of nations not an amalgamation into one. That interference is actually inevitable simply due to population. So even if everyone means well it doesnt matter. English culture trumps every time.gt why would I form a breakaway party? If there are minor differences then I can work within the parties instead.See this is more excuses. If it was really in the interest of the Scottish people it wouldnt be a big issue to form a new party. It would be a simple matter since all the MPs live here and have grass roots appeal as individuals. They would keep many if not all their votes from previous parties and likely regain any they had lost eventually. In the long run the party would have a far better locallyconcerned ideology and image.But instead youre making excuses to put the status quo of current party before public interest and Westminster before Scotland. That stance in itself is proof of a compromised position.gt And again in what sense is Scotland compromised by being part of a larger nation while Glasgow isnt?By compromised position I meant the political parties are not the nation.And the UK is not a nation and never will be its a Union of nations. That difference is actually very important. Were a closer dichotomy to Europe than to say Germany for instance. Despite whatever nonsense amalgamated image of British Culture the tabloid media are feeding the public in the UK we remain  very different cultures and nations all with different wants and needs. We need politics to reflect that. ,Scotland,cltq8mt,1,t5_2qkli

So if you dont devolve those taxes and cut the Barnett formula as it make sense to do if income tax is totally devolved then there will be a hole in Scotlands finances.

2844259,0,t1_cnrbu6m,Ive been on this program for a total of  days.    Technically I am still on it but I refuse to participate as its ridiculously flawed. Here are some of the reasons whyThe job search isnt hours a day on this program its  hours a week in the programs office not at a job center on a day of their choosing usually it is your sign on day so once you finish your job search you can go home then go sign on you still need to go to the job center as normal. If your JS day is at pm on a different day you need to go to work go to the job center then return to work.      Your transport is covered by the cheapest method of travel I live in glasgow and my placement was in helensburgh my cheapest method of travel was the bus. I have IBS so if Im travelling I need access to a toilet or im screwed so I got the train so I had to put  towards my all week pass  a fortnight is a lot of money when youre on jsa.On top of that lunch isnt covered because youd eat lunch in the house anyway so theres another  spent on lunch breaks because youve only got tins of food and frozen stuff at home which you eat more of because youve been working all day so theres more food you need to buy.Then when you are on your Job search day you see an awesome job posting that youre suitable for posted on monday? Well fuck you its friday youre application has been submitted  whole days later! Way to make a good impression. Granted you could do this at home after working all day getting in late making your dinner having a bath and getting an early night because youre up at  in the morning now.         But lets say this prospective new boss is alright with the fact your application was sent in on friday he read it on monday after all the weekend applications flooded his email and he gives you an interview. Going to an interview means youll be missing workjob search which then means The job center phones the interviewer to make sure you actually have an interview So theres a second good first impression Hey were just phoning to make sure X has an interview with you on Y now were not saying we think X is a liar and not to be trusted or anything but if you infer something from that then its beyond our control.Now I got placed in helensburgh because I missed the first interview that was arranged for me the letter came the day before the interview and I didnt get it until the interview time had passed So I got placed in the same shop in helensburgh no interview this time weird huh?I brought up my concerns and they told me I could get a local council run museum which I wouldnt have minded that much but they never said anything to me about it again even though they said they would.Anyway thats all beside the point it gives you valuable work experience to make you more attractive to employers and you also might get a job at the end of it!  Eh bullshit.       I already have about  years combined retail experience including a year as a store manager I dont think I need anymore practice.And I dont see how me polishing all the furniture yes even the fake wood effect vinyl shit in the charity shop every morning is teaching me anything. Money handling skills? Nope not allowed to use the till.So everyday for however long they wanted me on the program I would be polishing the wood effect off of furniture opening bags of old clothes and putting a label on them. Ah stop complaining they might hire you at the end!         Eh bullshit. I asked the store manager why I didnt need an interview and she told me it was because her boss knew the woman who ran the program and has dealt with her before with slaves like me. Even though apparantley this program has only been running less than a month?I also worked beside a  year old who had been there six months through a Get ready to work program The manager was the only paid staff in the shop so there is no jobs going nor will there ever be they get their full time staff from these programs.So I dont do it if I work full time I deserve a wage Im pretty sure thats a human right and there was a whole big thing about this a while ago? And if I am unable to find work I deserve the benefits that my tax money has funded before and that everyone is entitled to.I will not spend most the money that is by law there to feed me and keep me alive while I look for work on going to work for someone for free.Fucking hell the NWM isnt even a living wage and its expected of me to spend   of my  a fortnight to Earn my benefit fuck right off.So because I dont do that I get my benefits cut Im on hardship and Im currently getting  a week. For food electricity transport etc.Now you might think thats pretty shit having to live on  a week or you might not depending or which way you lean and how fucked up your perspective on the lower class is But what is even worse is that if I was doing the program therfore not receiving a benefit cut and getting my full amount of benefit I would still be living on  a week.Earning your benefit is a total sham and is only there to make the unemployeds life worse while making you feel better about all the benefit cuts and shaming of the unemployed because fuck em these cunts arent earning their benefits!Edit Here are some additional things Id like to add.In my job center not sure about the rest They have taken the Job points away so you cant look through the listings when youre waiting to sign.I applied and started a program called New enterprise where you get some help filling out business plans and help you get funding for a new business. Even though Ive had my meetings filled the paperwork and Im officially on the New enterprise program Im still getting sanctionscuts for not attending the Slave Labour program.,Scotland,cnre2xd,13,t5_2qkli
2847942,0,t3_2spieu,The first place you want to look is the General Teaching Council of Scotland. With the exception of a few private schools and it is a very few all Scottish schools require you to be GTCS registered. Now if your are a qualified teacher with teaching experience this registration may be easy to get but youll want to check out what the GTCS say about it. No GTCS registration no teaching.Youll also need a police letter from your current municipality because you will need a criminal record check and you will need to join the Protecting Vulnerable Groups PVG membership scheme. The GTCS will require this too. Youll need to visit the Disclosure Scotland website for information on what you need to do for this.As for working in Scotland as non EU citizens thatll be a much harder hurdle to clear. All employers are obliged to check if you are eligible to work in the UK. If youre not EU citizens you will need a work visa of some kind. To get one of those I think your employer has to show that no EU citizen can do that job. Thats hard enough for universities but schools? As  of newly registered teachers teachers who have just finished their induction year have yet to find permanent jobs I think you may give that quite hard to do. Your Masters qualifications might help especially as they are STEM ones but I know Scottish born and trained teachers with PhDs who still cant find permanent jobs. Is your second generation Scottish husband eligible for UK citizenship through a grandparent maybe? If youre not sure find out. I think you can hold joint UKUS citizenship but youll need to check that out too. If he is thatll make it much easier for at least him to find work and for you too in the long term.Not to say dont try it but its not going to be as easy as just applying for jobs.

3019520,0,t1_coaxrt2,It strikes me that a lot of you guys are basing this stuff on the huge assumption that labour would enter into a coalition or supply and demand arrangement with the SNP... personally I think its very unlikely for a number of reasons The price of the SNPs demands is likely to be higher than labours English MPs are prepared to pay. The obvious example is Trident.  Although it might get Miliband into power briefly in  it will do irreparable damage to Labours chances of ever forming a singleparty majority again... for two main reasons  because in Scotland it will only solidify the SNP as being the party of Scotland. Anything that comes out of the arrangement that is percieved to be good for Scotland will be attributed to the SNP and everything bad to labour. It will essentially be the PRdisaster the lib dems have been dealing with for the last  years only for labour.  Because to the  of Britons who live in England it will appear to be a labour government propped up by a party that only  of people could vote for. Whilst in Scotland the SNP enjoy a modicum of respect and public support in England the party is seen as absolute anathema. If labour are perceived to be willing to sell themselves to the SNP just for a narrow majority it could be a PRdisaster in the future. ,Scotland,coayy9s,9,t5_2qkli

Subsidies blanket economic strategies and arguably the democratic deficits like West Lothian and EVEL. I am increasingly viewing Unionism as a fairly idealist standpoint nowadays.

In your entire answer you miss out the clear divide in Scotland that was present from at least the late middle ages the divide between the Presbyterian Scots speaking lowlanders and the Catholic Gaelic speaking highlanders.

In the case of the EU I have always thought that we should get a chance to make the decision and to put the issue to bed once and for a generation but the evidence so far in the UK is that referendums arent a particularly good way of making popular decisions because people struggle to accept the result and it naturally becomes a neverendum.  I dont think that this over rides our right to get to make that decision for this generation but in the interest of stability which I accept is something lots on here dont care about but it is essential to healthy economy so people can plan with confidence I think that any future referendums that are held should have a time commitment included e.g. decision will be respected by signing parties for x years.  ,Scotland,cq7lijj,5,t5_2qkli

Quebec has been given powers over lots of the matters in Quebec including lots of taxes whereas the Scottish government only has powers over health education transport scots law and various other matters with some income tax varying powers but this power can only vary the flat rate of income  tax and has never been used for obvious reasons.The main reason I think Scottish independence is inevitable is that the main UK parties will never give Scotland a federal settlement or devo max or home rule or whatever other names they can come up with for all powers devolved to the Scottish parliament except foreign policy defence and some monetary policy.

At no point have I made an assertion even remotely close to that. And I find it borderline offensive that you would even suggest such a thing. You are only showing your complete ignorance of the motivations of the supports of Scottish Independence.

And I would treat them as true fellows once they had settled in. And quit using your catchphrase Identity Politics. Weve went over this.

Someone with such a high profile and a large following will attract all sorts. She is also a big money backer of the No campaign so would also attract even more attention. However surely we can agree this is a minority of internet gobshites? Im sure being called an English bitch by  people in a row or whatever she is abused with is awful and draining over time. However is this what she bases her antiEnglish sentiment on? Is she even out and about in Edinburgh these days talking to your average person? Baring in mind roughly half of those who bothered to vote did indeed back the SNP? Do they all hate her because of where she was born and raised? Does she honestly not feel accepted in her adopted home outside of this internet bubble?I have genuinely not seen any antiEnglish sentiment in Scotland or any from SNP supporters. I am not denying the knuckle draggers exist but I havent seen any. Im currently in the office with only two other people today. Both are English and both have settled in Scotland. One is a big SNP supporter whilst the other is a bit of a classic Tory. Neither have experienced any antiEnglish sentiment bar being called an English wanker once in a Glasgow pub  years ago.This is the problem with all this back and forward arguing though isnt it? It comes down to personal accounts and experiences. Someone who disagrees with me will tell me the time his English mate got chibbed because of his accent. I can reply with the time I got called a dirty Jock bastard and pushed over in an English themed pub in Tokyo by some cockney. The thing is... antiEnglish sentiment in Scotland exists in some manner and viceversa. However how is this not just labelled as individual morons? I can determine this myself when Im in England or abroad. I think we all can. Has she ever read ANY British media article on Scottish politics? Why does she not balance her argument with the constant stream of vile vitriol directed towards Scotland on a daily basis? I dont dislike her because shes English or backed the No campaign. Even yesterday I once again praised the article she wrote during the referendum with one exception. That exception is that she is the only figure apart from maybe her mate Alastair Darling that I have ever heard bring up the blood and soil nationalism argument with her Death Eaterish comment. Personally I think she is acting irresponsible in portraying Scotland as a racist country to her worldwide audience. She never balances the debate nor provides any detailed evidence.

If you let one part with more population have more votes when theres as big a difference as we have especially and they consistently get their way even though others continually oppose them then it ends up creating the same kind of situation as what led to the Independence vote.Its a tricky situation indeed. On one hand you would want to do it by population count because thats how many people wanted it but at the same time that population is split between  separate countries. If  or  of them consistently vote against the bigger part and ultimately are ignored then it will certainly breed resentment sooner or later.

But we digress since comparing the past to now is a folly since its a completely different situation in the world.gt And the problem last election wasnt that Labour was too far left nor was it too close to the centre. The problems were that they failed to pick a position and stick to it they did not develop a coherent narrative they did not defend their previous record they shied away from arguing their case both in Scotland and in the rest of the UK and finally they did not respond to political reality which is not the same as making a Uturn.They couldnt stick a position because they are both discredited in the eyes of the electorate. People dont want old labour since the winter of discontent will always arise if they went more left. Blair and Brown tarnished the centre of Labour who wants to vote for a party that destabilised a country in an illegal war and ruined the economy I dont believe the last part but that is the narrative.Labour either go to the roots and appeal to the left ensuring support in the North and London but lose a lot of the centre vote or go for the centre vote and lose Scotland.

There shouldnt be special rules here which permit behaviour we would never tolerate in the real world.Its like a pub with a lot of regulars. Mostly we talk about the same old stuff and we welcome new people pretty happily. But weve got a few arseholes who make a nuisance of themselves  weve got a guy who butts into every conversation about Alex Salmond or Nicola Sturgeon and calls them dear leader and makes jabs about SNP supporters. Every single time.Mostly the regulars are tolerant and deal with this by turning away and not listening. Thats what the downvote is by the way its not censorship because it doesnt delete the comment and its not disagreement that would be posting a contradictory comment in reply its just a way of not listening to someone whos butting in. Thats why removing the downvote button is a terrible idea  it doesnt stop us from disagreeing it just stops us from politely ignoring as a group our trolls.Theres a key distinction between trolling and expressing a dissenting opinion trolls dont form their own discussions they colonise other peoples discussions where they disagree with the majority in order to cause trouble. In a pub we wouldnt tolerate people who specifically looked for tables where they disagreed with the ongoing discussion then sat down and started abusing the other people at the table. That would be crazy and I see no reasonable argument for tolerating it here.And we need to get past the lol circlejerk idea too. Agreement isnt a bad thing. Neither are shared values and attitudes. Good ideas and new thinking dont come from violent aggressive confrontations they come from exploration and collaboration. In the pub we dont break up tables of friends who are agreeing and we dont claim that what they really need is an argumentative dickhead to even them out.There are people here who dont agree with the majority but who start their own discussions fight their corner well and contribute good ideas. Ignatiousorlly is one. But we also have a pretty serious trolling problem posters who colonise other peoples discussions and try to cause trouble. If we want the pub to be a friendly place where we can all sit down and a have a pint and a blether in comfort those guys have got to shut up or leave. Spitting on the barman then demanding that you have a right to be served is just stupid.

4976055,0,t3_3j2r56,Behind the wallTHROUGHOUT the Scottish independence campaign I observed many BBC Scotland journalists at close quarters on those occasions when I was invited to chip in my tuppence worth on air. There are some big personalities among this band and some very bright and gifted people yet never did any of them forget that they were journalists first and last and that working for the national broadcaster they had a moral duty to be impartial. Being human they didnt always achieve this goal but under immense daily pressure from spin doctors from either side of the debate they performed admirably and often made me proud that they shared my profession.The issue of what we want the BBC to look like in Scotland is once more vexing the country. Ahead of the corporations charter renewal London BBCs upgrading in status of its Scotland Correspondent to Scotland Editor is merely condescending. Its like giving a child a toy catapult to replace his peashooter. BBC Scotland in its coverage of news and current affairs and in its unique position to alter the face of how drama is written acted and produced in Scotland ought to be at the very centre of Scotlands cultural life. Instead it remains on the sidelines waiting meekly each month outside a door in London marked senior executives only to find out if it has received permission to commission a new programme or make grownup changes to its news and politics coverage.The newsgathering and editing infrastructure in Scotland is piecemeal and inconsistent while a macho s working culture has been allowed to flourish in the newsroom. As such many fine journalists have become demotivated and reluctant to contribute ideas for fear of being ridiculed. Some programmes Ive observed being made look like theyve been edited in a bar at the end of the universe.A mere glance at what we know about how little BBC Scotland receives in crumbs from Londons table reveals much. The BBC has an annual budget of around . billion and licence fees in Scotland bring in more than  million. BBC executives insist that BBC Scotland gets between m and m every year a figure which is seriously misleading. A sum of between m and m forms part of the Network Supply Review under which a number of programmes are produced for the UK network. These include Question Time Homes Under the Hammer and all the lottery game shows. They are known as lift and shift programmes they did not originate in Scotland their teams are not based here and often their crews and technical studio staff are flown in from England in a Monday morning ritual derided in Pacific Quay as the trundle of the trolleybags. They are not Scottish programmes made by Scotland about Scotland and for Scotland. So the true budget for Scottish programmes lies between m and m.A tantalising glimpse of what a fully functioning BBC Scotland could look like  deploying to the full the creative gifts of Scottish journalism Scottish screenwriting and Scottish production expertise  has recently emerged from inside Pacific Quay. Unfortunately several unionist commentators would have you believe that Scotland does not have sufficient native talent to match anything written and produced in London. This is a lie advanced by people who obviously never watched BBC Scotland specials such as The Great Tram Disaster Portillo on Salmond and Iain Banks  Raw Spirit.THE Charter Renewal team in BBC Scotland have produced a blueprint for the future of the BBC in Scotland which is nothing less than a broadcasting Magna Carta. In preparing it they commissioned research based around European models such as Finland and Denmark. These are similarsized nations whose national broadcasters get audience shares three to four times the size of BBC Scotland. They are small countries making programmes for which their audience has a huge appetite and the best of which are sold across the globe.The blueprint has been backed by the entire Scottish executive team led by Ken McQuarrie. Everything they asked for was accepted by London senior management. Overnight BBC Scotlands programmemaking budget would have grown fivefold to more than m and would have devolved all programmemaking to BBC Scotland with the emphasis on serving Scotland first but being able to show any programmes on the network and sell them to other nations. A Scottish BBC channel broadcasting HD to Scotland every weekday night between  and midnight would be created.Reporting Scotland on BBC One would be retained but an hourlong news programme would be added broadcasting at peak time every night covering Scottish UK and world affairs from a Scottish perspective. This would require extra staff and the building of a new studio. There would be overseas and London bureaux along the RTE model.A second Radio Scotland channel would be created too while there would be huge investment in commissioning Scottish drama comedy entertainment factual and music programmes. There would be proper investment in education content.Such a package would have transformed Scotlands cultural life at a stroke. Currently there is little drama worth speaking of commissioned written and produced in Scotland. What little there is depicts the country as a land that never sees sunlight where wee hard men who always look like Peter Mullen walk around chibbing people all over the shop. Other than that we are forcefed a diet of some of the worst comedy in the English language such as Mountain Goats if this had starred actual mountain goats it would have been funnier and the infantile Bob Servant which is about as funny as dooking for chips. Who needs England to misrepresent us when we seem perfectly capable of doing it ourselves?Since the Scottish Charter Renewal teams blueprint was first accepted enthusiastically it has since been quietly pulled and rewritten. Tony Hall under pressure from k London executives who are all defending their little metropolitan fiefdoms is now saying it will never happen.He must think again under pressure from every political party in Scotland. The decline in the newspaper industry means a BBC Scotland providing highquality cuttingedge journalism and worldclass Scottish drama has never been more needed.,Scotland,culroou,3,t5_2qkli

Habitats that have evolved to recover from extreme natural disturbances tend to be better able to recover from the damage of fishing gear essentially its little different to another storm from the beasties perspective as long as it doesnt happen too frequently.  Of course the passage of the gear could still be physically damaging in very calm and stable seabed habitats mud and those that support a lot of sessile epibenthic species reef.  Those tend not to be the sandy seabed types in which razor fish are found though.  I think the bigger concern is the effect of the electricity on other benthic fauna  particularly non target invertebrate species worms etc and any changes that could be caused in the biogeochemical processes within the seabed,Scotland,cyijck0,2,t5_2qkli

A formalisation process is usually achieved by cultural output first printing of a Bible or a great work of the language eg. Dante and Goethe for Italian and German. Scots doesnt have that theres no unifying work to formalise spelling  preferred words etc. so thats why the National piece came across as quite irritating in some ways. It was a hodgepodge of words used across Scotland which is odd. We could standardise and make Scots a language. It would be both a good and a bad thing. Good in that we recognise the richness there is in the Scots tongue which is undoubtedly there. However a unified Scots would mean eliminating the hodgepodge it would mean elevating one persons Scots above anothers. With Dante the more correct Italian was based on the language used in Tuscany or with German the first bible printed in the language of Saxony.  Despite the mess that was the National in my eyes the language naysayers seem to be denying a richness that should be encouraged and explored. I find it quite exciting there are books and things being published in whats called Scots. On the other hand the prolanguage folk should be careful what they wish for.

6340599,0,t1_czabjqi,Of course all nationalities are constructed but few are constructed with such intent as Britishness the most comparable example I can think of right now would be European its very much one that is foisted upon rather than adopted by.Scottish as an identity was invented sure but if you think it was in the th century then youre missing a fair few centuries that was an attempted britification of Scottishness a way to put Scottishness as a subset of Britishness. Are you genuinely saying you think the idea of a Scottish identity formed in the th century?where do you live if you dont mind me asking have you moved to Scotland recently or something because that really is a massive what sort of a moment a strong Scottish identity has existed despite Britain not because of it. Now it certainly has changed over the years but that is an incredible claim to have made.gtAlso Im not a British nationalist I laugh at this notion that if you are a yoon you are a Britnat. Im not. I just want the United Kingdom to remain for various reasons.I dont know what the problem of so many unionists with being associated with the word nationalist is I think it primarily stems from it being used to apply negative connotations to the people its being used on unionists see nationalist as a word for bad people so when its used in relation to themselves its taken as offensive.I mean whats so bad about thinking the people of Scotland ought to be sovereign? never mind anything else you apply to it that specific proposal.I think a lot of unionists are nationalists they just hate the thought of begin associated with the negativity that most yes voters have just realised doesnt actually apply to what they campaign for.gtIts meaningless though all countries are essentially amalgamations over time. Though the thing is back to the point of my first post.....the SNP are the ones constantly trying to divide the peoples of Britain and engineer a new national identity create new purely Scottish sense of identity that doesnt encompass Britain so graudally more and more Scots feel less and less association with rUK peoplesociety. Its a remarkable tactic and their are clearly some cunning tacticians in the SNP. But the point is some of us need to be on hand to keep their cunning plans in check.i really need to know where you learnt history because... seriously this is worrying.A Scottish Identity has existed independent of a British one for a long time over the last few hundred years it has been incorporated with limited success into a british one the same is true of EnglishAlso the SNP are actually ridiculously keen to adopt the idea of a family of nations.the people dividing the people of the UK in my view are the British Nationalists they continually advocate the destruction of the home countries and its something I cant accept.Im perfectly open to the idea of the UK continuing but not at the expense of destroying my country take your view of history youll look back in years to come once youve had more exposure to Scottish and British history and realise how mislead youve been but this attempt to rewrite history by whoever has taught you that is too much for me and most in the UK British nationalists want there to only have ever been a British nation and only ever be one as a result as you can see any time you turn on the TV the idea of a singular British identity is pushed relentlessly.Its subtle but people have started to finally push back right across the UK people are saying no they wont be forced to identify with Britishness and to erase their nation ultimately British Nationalists are the ones dividing the UK in their desire to invent a British nation theyre pissing everyone in it off the SNP are the scottish example of people pissed off at the erasure of their nation.Ultimately the British nationalists will be the ones to end the UK through their divisiveness.,Scotland,czactbq,1,t5_2qkli

This gave them a chance to put it in practice without  so they thought  much risk of it backfiring.I dont think the devolved governments were really meant to be indecisive  Labour is hardly going to object to that when its making the decisions.

Youre defence of the rebate which remains uncosted by the party that proposed it as well as not having actually been explained by the party that proposed it is absurd. The problem with the policy aside from the fact that it taxes people and gives them back money at the same time and so only constitutes a waste of the money it takes to process is that the party that set it out refuses to explain what it would do. You seem to think that its the Scottish Governments job to explain a Scottish Labour policy that they themself cant explain. And if the Scottish Government came out and said This will cost m to administer you think that people would accept that? Dont be ridiculous. If Labour want to be considered a serious party they need to explain their own policies  the fact that they cant is hugely telling. gtDo you honestly think its better to have the cuts than to raise taxes imperfect though they may be to keep the public services?I support taxing those who can afford it more. As mapped out by the think tank that supports Scottish Labours position  thats the most progressive option. I dont support taxing the lowest paid in order to alleviate cuts. gtWhat you fail to justify in your argument is why the tax raise is worse than the austerity that it would cancel out.This is completely at odds with your argument is that Scottish Labours tax rise doesnt just pass on austerity cuts to taxpayers. If the tax raise is cancelling out austerity then surely you dont still contend that thats not passing on austerity cuts? Youve completely undermined your own point.As for the progressive or unprogressiveness of this policy  Ive just quoted you extracts of the only supportive comments of it  and they explicitly say that it benefits doubleearner middle income families that the rebate system isnt progressive in the least and that a flat rate increase isnt progressive.

7700447,0,t3_4krq5b,I am an American postgrad student in Aberdeen. I have done all my higher education in the UK though and in a very different discipline. From what I know of the American system youll find the UK postgrad programmes much more relaxed in terms of competitiveness but equally possibly more challenging in terms of material than a US course due to a greater degree of specialisation. Students who did their undergrad in Scotland will have  years of studying not much else other than engineering or engineering related subjects. There isnt really an equivalent to core classes here although you do get to take subjects other than your degree programme in your first two years of undergrad.Most Masters programmes are  months although you would have the option to do it parttime  months which I would recommend because you can be more cost neutral if you can find a decent parttime job. You also have two years to build contacts which is a big part of any postgrad degree.More than anything and especially in a field like Engineering I would be thinking about what comes after. If you are looking to immigrate to  Europe which will be easy with your EU passport but if you are thinking of the UK then you may need to hurry up... then doing a postgrad course here is a great option to get yourself established and possibly make some contacts before applying for jobs. If you are wanting to return to the US then perhaps less so but youd still have a great time and that may be worth it. ,Scotland,d3hhnb5,5,t5_2qkli

As for the dreadful injustice stuff the Brain family moved here on a wing and a prayer hoping to use a scheme that would only have guaranteed  years residency.  years of living and working here later they still dont satisfy the visa requirements.What it all seems to boil down to is that they should be allowed to stay here...because they want to. And because theyve got a wean that speaks Gaelic its been picked up by the media as a human interest story. Just what did they think was going to happen when they moved here? What were they planning to do after  years visa was cancelled?

The party that wants it barely got over the threshold for getting into parliament at the last election . And for the past  years theres been an agreement in place between literally every other political party in the country to not work with them on anything. Theyre called Vlaams Belang previously Vlaams Bloc but they had to change their name when they were prosecuted for racism about a decade ago.Mayor of Antwerp and leader of the largest party in Flanders Bart De Wever said this to Tom Van Grieken of Vlaams Belang in a televised debateIf you passed a motion that said The sun shines I still wouldnt vote with you.They are ultimate fringe and usually seen as more of a protest vote. Now their support could grow but not to levels large enough to make them relevant theyd literally need an overall majority for that since no other party will ever work with them.But more important than all of this probably is the difference in political situation between Spain and Belgium. There is no effort in Belgium to silence independence wishers. There is a huge problem in Spain because one region so obviously wants to split and the government does not want to allow it.

For example Scotland pays .bn to UK Defence when comparable countries range from .bn Ireland to bn Norway the normal for a NATO country our size would be between bn and .bn.  We could even do an Iceland and not bother paying a fee to NATO instead.  Defense for a country like Scotland or the UK is just willy waving its meaningless in the scheme of things.Others are harder to come by.  We pay our share of the National Infrastructure Plan where spending predominantly in London is classified as UK and charged to Scotland.  This varies a decent estimate in  was bn saving to Scotland.

They had very little industry poor education system some people said they would fail hard. They struggled the first few years voted in an authoritarian asshole and were out of the NATO and EU integration process. They managed to get rid of him though and after that we supported them heavily in their efforts to catch up in the integration process. In the late s they pushed through so succesful economic reforms that they almost caught up with us economicaly and proved everyone that they can do on their own. The relationships between our people were never as good as now with over  having favourable views of each other. We dont get to blame each other for our own shortcomings on the contrary we appreciate that we have such a close and reliable partner in each other. Overall the split was the best thing that could happen to both of us. No sour feelings or regrets here.I understand that the UK vs Scotland situation is not exactly the same but I just wanted to support you by giving this example which proves that it can work.

Solar technology is vastly improving but apart from the initial outlay of purchasing the kit the issue is capacity and storage should you wish to take into account FIT. What I think we need is a change in Government policy to encourage many forms of Micro Generation for new buildings to try and best avoid larger power plants.As for your other points  the regulations state that new windows to new build domestic dwellings have to have a uvalue of . WmK and many double glazed units achieve that. Extensions to domestic dwellings actually have more onerous targets which I think is a missed opportunity  so yeah by all means request better uvalues for the windows but to make it effective you also have to increase the targets of the walls floors and roof. The passivhaus standard is great in theory but I think for it to be used on a wide scale it needs to be made more user friendly. What I find in the architecture industry is that many Clients wish to follow the standards but then not actually pay for the final certification at the end which is an additional cost. You may need to employ an accredited specialist consultant just for the design process and as mentioned below the costs of all these elements soon add up which put people off.Of course things will get better but there needs to be a concerted and radical approach to housebuilding in the UK. Volume house builders and domestic Clients alike need to be on the same page and if the Government can lead with exemplars from the continent tighter regulations and tax breaks and or increases then that would definitely assist. ,Scotland,d5iszeq,1,t5_2qkli

It would need another version of the Edinburgh Agreement to be agreed between the two governments its not in Nicolas gift to do that. i.e. it would then need legislation to flow through the house of commons and house of lords and then follow on through to Holyrood.The Edinburgh Agreement stated that the referendum have a clear legal base be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament timeboxed! be conducted so as to command the confidence of parliaments government and people deliver a fair test and decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respectThere is an argument that weve had a decisive expression  and there is a scenario where the UK government is unwilling to play ball and yes there are long term issues with this... which the SNP have been trying to get the Tories to say  they could state that NSs tests in  were around a majority of MSPs with an independence referendum on their manifesto and they were the only ones  the greens said theyd campaign in the event but didnt say theyd call for one  and that they didnt meet that test.The UK government could legislate in its place and change the bias of the question.

8505102,0,t3_4w70jg,I know nothing about the NHS but I know a few things about anxiety and depression. First of all please dont be afraid of antidepressants! Not all of them have bad side effects and people respond differently. And its very common for someone to try a couple different meds before they find one thats right for them. Dont get discouraged. Everyone is different so theres some trial and error.Also I do know there are drugs like Wellbutrin that rarely have negative side effects and can actually boost sexual feeling. Crazy right?! But even for drugs with sexual side effects they often dont last long. Your body gets used to the med and the side effects diminish. Definitely worth a try for major depressive episodes! People dont have to be on them forever and Ive never known anyone to be addicted to an SSRI. As far as anxiety meds I would steer well clear of benzos. They work like a dream but they change the way the gabba receptors fire and they become physically addicting in that sense. I dont mean youll crave them or have any emotional attachment to them although some people actually do but within days your brain gets used to them and if you go off youll feel withdrawal. In fact when someone is on them a long time the drug must be tapered slowly because its very very dangerous to go off suddenly. If someone has major panic attacks benzos have their place but its not great for everyday use if it can be helped. Xanax is the worst benzo because it has a very short halflife. Something like Valium is safer. Luckily there are also non benzo options for anxiety like Celexa. They work totally different. Other than therapy Id try doing a CBT workbook on your own. Id also suggest diving into an activity that takes all your focus. Learning a musical instrument is perfect for this. Or taking partner dance classes Partner not needed btw. The way theyre set up singles are more than welcome because you switch partners constantly in a rotation. Or just any activity that makes you lose track of time. Lots of research suggests that people are happiest when they spend time everyday in the zone. Theres a great TED Talk about this. Ill see if I can find it!  ,Scotland,d64oxji,2,t5_2qkli

Things like this arent some sort of distant relic of the past thats only  years ago.Nah see this is truly living in the past. You truly think that the UK Government today doesnt want Scotland to prosper even while remaining part of the UK even while having Scottish people who have held longterm political power like Gordon Brown?It really is nonsense  you talk about s as though they were recently but homosexuality was only decriminalised in   truly showing that the Government and entire political class was an entire World away from today back when what today constitutes entire independent nations like Belize were still colonies of the Empire.As for the McCrone report  no geopolitical or economic prediction or study in the last hundred years has actually come into reality. You are incredibly angry and bitter about some perceived alternative reality where Scotland is a wonderful wealthy country like Norway where you have a better quality of life.Its really bizarre and shouldnt affect anyones view on independence now because becoming independent of a thoughroughly changed UK from the s wont bring the oil back or improve the Scottish economy.You sound like a conspiracy theorist in this respect believing that a secret evil group in the British Government is holding back the progress of an entire country and people.

8949122,1,t3_52shvg,Reading through the comments its really horrible as a Scot knowing other people are getting a hard time.. Let me try to clear it up a little. Scottish people are inherently a little moany about anything but we do like people especially if you are having a pint with us. Then the whole UK Independence thing came along. Some of us wanted to be away from England and their habits however some of us wanted to stay with them. Later on the EU Referendum.. now it got complicated. Those who didnt want to be away from England wanted away from Europe and those people were the guys constantly shouting all these foreigners coming here taking our jobs! Oh no our unskilled minimum wage jobs.. whatever shall we do? Anyway things have become a little jaded around these cold n wet parts mostly. The feelings have intensified a little and misinformation has been spread something terrible. Personally I would like to see Scotland not as part of the UK but as part of Europe still. Im open to people coming here much as I am for our people going to other countries. Actually if Scotland were to be independent we would NEED more tourism. Like a constant supply of the damn thing. Now of course everything I have mentioned mileage may vary depending where you are etc.. its just a brief and light hearted take on it. Dont give me grief. Thing is Im only the second generation of my family born here. My family came from Italy they came here and opened cafes employed local people spoke their language and went to their events and were part of the community. It CAN work it isnt a scary thought stop reading newspapers and youll be fine. On that note I actually would like to live in another country some day once my kids grow up a little so hopefully other countries can be as nice and understanding and accepting as I am hoping lol.

9156802,0,t1_d8cnmbb,gtSo the campaigners of the remain side promised to accelerate devolution so that Scotland could have the power to decide things for itself without having to rely on westminster while remaining in the UK.While I agree with a lot of your post I dont really agree that this includes our membership of the EU. They promised to give power over local issues over to Scotland but that doesnt mean that the UK cant make any decisions as a whole. Particularly with foreign policy it seems that Scotland had a choice between sharing it with England and Wales or being independent. I cant really see any alternative and I dont really buy that people voted No under the belief that this wasnt true. The EU is very much a question of foreign policy.gtMy main contention was that the UK used FPTP representation. This creates a problem of majority rule and while some people would argue thats democracy they do not understand the problem with it.FPTP has huge problems. Arguably so does PR see Spain or several EU nations which are stuck in political deadlock for months at a time. I would also say that AMS isnt an improvement as it has huge potential to be gamed by two identical parties running together but being officially separate. I would agree that FPTPs main problem is that it results in a parliament which isnt representative of the general public. I dont really see gerrymandering as that great a solution as it means frequently moving borders and wont always be possible eg. if  of the population supports Green but is spread evenly throughout the country. I think AV is the best of a bad bunch. Its controversial but I think AMS is much more abusable than people realise.gtAnyway despite devolution and the progress we made from the indyref the EU referendum shows clearly how big the problem is to Scotland. And thats why I believe we owe it to ourselves to have a second referendum.Part of the reason that I think its wrong to have a referendum now is that nothing has changed. Until some time in  we wont really know what deal is worked out with the EU and I dont think its fair to ask for another vote right until we do. Id probably vote No again out of resentment if I were asked again so soon and without being given the chance to see what direction the UK is going in before making my choice. ,Scotland,d8covym,3,t5_2qkli

9227882,0,t1_d8l71c9,gt The issue of what currency an independent Scotland would use. This is probably even more of an issue now as the Brexit clusterfuck makes retaining the Pound with a nonEU state a much more complicated issue.I think the correct answer here is to explicitly go for a Scottish Pound.It will be pegged to Sterling in the short term so in practical terms it is completely equivalent to Sterlingisation you have the same notes with the same value as today it does not require the UKs permission and it opens the door to either floating or pegging to another currency in the future.By far the biggest problem in  was stating that the UK would  no question  share a currency with Scotland. In practical terms I think Salmond was correct in realpolitik terms it was an absolute own goal as DarlingOsborne could simply say No.A Scottish Pound completely undercuts that argument.gt Generic separation causes economic uncertainty arguments with the No campaign now having Brexit to use as an example.The correct answer here is to say that separating from the EU will be worse.That rUK is Scotlands largest trading partner means that trade barriers between rUK and the EU will hurt Scotland. Trade barriers will hurt Scotland  that hurt was caused by the politicians who pulled Scotland out of the EU.Scotland will tackle that on two fronts. Firstly by working with the EU and those in rUK who want to avoid pointless trade barriers. Secondly by diversifying Scotlands economy  just as Ireland did after independence  to trade with a wider range of countries across the EU.gt Yes would have to produce an answer to both which is both fairly easy for the average punter to understand and which can be condensed into easilyrepeatable soundbites.I agree Yes had some good lines last time round but fluffed the currency story completely.I think Sturgeon is less ideological than Salmond in that respect. It would be far more effective to have both a soundbite Scotlands currency is the Scottish Pound Scotland wants free trade  with all our neighboursand a debate We will peg to Sterling just as Ireland did for  years and Denmark still does. If Sterling continues to collapse we will have the option to follow that currency or not depending on whats in Scotlands best interests. But the Scottish Pound belongs to Scotland. Trade barriers between rUK and the EU will hurt the Scottish economy. We reject the Conservatives claim that those trade barriers are necessary but if the Conservatives create them we will protect Scotland by taking advantage of our ability to increase trading with the EU. We want free trade with all our neighbours.A lot depends on what form May decides Brexit should finally take.

Italy the same the Euro is helping them stave off mass inflation and economic collapse due to decades of internal economic ineptness.The Euro is destroying the southern EU states. Not Ireland I agree but Greece Italy Portugal etc simply cannot cope with the Euro. They cannot compete with Germany at the same fixed exchange rate. Even if they had the same government the same policies the same workforce the geographical problems alone would make it impossible for them to compete. Floating currencies provide a natural stabilisation mechanism. If the Euro did not exist the DM would now be valued so highly Germany would have difficulty selling its goods abroad and would be sucking in imports at a much higher rate from other European countries. Greece would have a currency so low that it would drive an even larger tourist boom and encourage companies to set up there. gtTheres a reason why its such a small sum compared the states in the US give back and thats because these are sovereign countries not states of a single country.

9908664,0,t1_daz41u9,Thats a fair enough idea. Theres nothing open on our High Street beyond  except pubs takeaways the odd restaurant bookies and Markies.    Personally I think we should be looking at changing the role of High Streets. Online shopping is continuing to grow at a huge rate and out of town shopping centres and retail parks have many advantages over town centres that the High Street just cannot replicate. Instead of trying to attract big retailers back into town centres what we ought to be doing is using more space in town centres for residential purposes. On Elgin High Street for instance there are so many buildings which are completely vacant on the upper floors or vacant altogether  given the housing shortage practically everywhere these places would make brilliant flats and theyre close to transport links and amenities too. The added advantage is that the more people there are living in town centres the more trade you can expect the nearby businesses to get. We need to reimagine High Streets as places to live IMO and this will breathe life back into them  we cant go back in time to when all of our shops were in town centres because that isnt beneficial to shoppers or to businesses.,Scotland,daz4f29,1,t5_2qkli

9999537,0,t3_5itp9a,Its interesting  we quite often land near the top of these lists and having lived in a variety of places the biggest difference I find is the relative lack of anxiety. You can put this down to a lot of things but mostly I think the pace of life is just a bit slower up here. Its also quite close to a classless society so social climbing  and the pretensions and anxieties that go with it  are not really a thing. Its like a Scandinavian society in that sense. People go to great lengths not to outdo their neighbours. People often build far more modest homes than they could afford to for fear of driving a wedge between them and their neighbours. To say that someone is ordinary is actually a sincere compliment up here. That makes for very ugly architecture but quite a nice society. Another anxiety reducing factor imo is that its impossible to live up here and be under the belief that you are a lonely individual with no connection to society. You will soon learn that most people living near you know who you are what you do who youre connected to etc. And that they are curious to learn more. The rumour mill is legendary. Its claustrophobic at first but the longer I live here the more I see it as a good thing.,Scotland,dbayv7v,30,t5_2qkli

If this is true it explains a lotgt Reading the content rather than the polittical soundbites it appears that the SFC is receives monies on the understanding that unallocated funds are returned to the government at the end of each accounting period. This is similar to the Labourrun administration returnung a considerable portion of the block grant to the Treasury. However some SFC officils have attempted to use c. . of their budget as a slush fund and have been called on it. if they want to change the accounting rules then they should make a formal request to the Scottish Government.,Scotland,dcsiw0e,11,t5_2qkli

10536834,0,t1_dd2f8tj,gtThe article is saying the unionists would be two more seats up if some SNP supporters didnt vote Green.As I said the number of proIndependence votes actually went up overall by a very slight amount yet proIndependence parties lost  seats overall. SNP lost  while Greens gained . This article is saying that that without tactical voting the SNP would have a majority whilst the Greens would have retained their original  seats. So if you look at it from a pure numbers perspective the headline is right when it says ProIndependence voters didnt help Unionists by splitting their votes. Id argue that any benefit that there is from an additional  ProIndependence MSPs is more than negated by the way the SNP only winning a minority was spun and is still used to attack ProIndependence policies such as another referendum with Brexit etc. And as I said thats not even getting into the pointless and damaging way the Greens let Ruth Davidson gain a constituency seat. But those are different arguments.My point is that this headling is utter bullshitgtAlthough there might have been a slim SNP majority if they hadnt.So then there was harm to the SNP. In pure number terms this report shows that there are two extra proIndependence MSPs and that it cost the SNP a majority. Short of being vindicated as Ive seen many people on Twitter claim this report seems to prove that Greensothers telling SNP voters that they were guaranteed a majority and that they should vote Green on the list actually cost the SNP a majority.,Scotland,dd2gt3f,4,t5_2qkli

10688940,0,t3_5svhy9,Rather than got into the modern day specifics Ill try to explain my understanding of why Scotland has diverged from rUK. This is nothing to do with what was right or what was wrong just a summing up of the factors that has lead us here.Lets starts at the early th century. Scotland was a happy partner in the U.K. with mainly coal mining fishing and boat building industries and with a strong workers union culture. The union culture allowed many lower class members of Scotland not only work with but also fight with their English counter parts for their workers rights.A couple of wars created camaraderie and a bunker mentality between the nations and we plodded along fine. Scotlands main industries steadily declined until we arrived into the stagnation and union obstructionism of the s. Thatcher then came into power and proceeded to shutdown the coal industry which seriously damaged Scotlands economy and all but destroy the unions which isolated the lower class Scots from the workers of the other countries of the U.K.But as luck has it oil was also found in Scottish waters and this new commodity allowed Scotland to pay more than its fair share into the U.K.s budget. Sure it wasnt the large scale investment needed to help the country diversify from its defunct industries but it paid the bills. This left the country stuck in a constant low growth stagnantion.Successive governments after Thatcher continued down the path she had set and never really put the money or effort in needed to properly shift the country out of its funk. England on the other hand though admittedly sections of had exactly the same issues as Scotland went through various booms and busts. Even the parts that didnt directly partake in the booms and busts were noticeably affected by this economic activity but Scotland for whatever reasons did not feel very much from them.The Scottish electorate started to get a little fed up with the lack of movement around them and Tony Blair ushered in a new solution to alley their dissafection Devolution! The only problem being that it didnt give Scotland the necessary tools to try to remedy their predicament but it did manage to solidify a new identity for the one that had been lost with the removal of the unions.The Scottish now with a stronger identity to fall in line with started to demand more of Westminster to help them fix their problems but Westminster seemed to either not care was incapable of helping or was actively hostile to helping depending on how you see things. Added on top of this was the fact that the environments the Scottish and English had enhabitted had increasingly diverged ever since Thatchers great social shift and so each countries worries and problems became harder and more obscure to other as time went on.Thats about it.,Scotland,ddihhal,3,t5_2qkli

They never have been in the past. Treaty change is a very long difficult process in the EU. The EU itself is working towards an ever closer union and rolling back things already agreed in the treaties is simply not something they will countenance.Cameron tried with an upcoming UK referendum as ammunition and got nowhere.The EU may be prepared to fudge the rules.

The Rev Stu calls out that this might be the case to his credit.However I think theyre pretty simplistic and I cant follow any of the links back to their source. Itd be good to know in a bit more detail how these figures break down and exactly what the criteria are for each column.For example Glasgow was the Empires second city for a reason those payments for Imperial Services werent to the complete detriment of Scotland. Its seems odd to covet the revenue raised by Scotland as a part of Empire and assume it could have all been pocketed without paying into it as well. Also theres no way of knowing without further information but Imperial Services could include the all manner of costs although not spent geographically in Scotland that would have been spent by an independent Scotland had it been governing itself as there was no devolution.It would also be significant to see how much money raised in England Wales and Ireland were committed to Imperial Services at this time so we had a basis for comparison.

Ive been in plenty situations where Ive been racially abused or even attackedjumped and noones stuck up for me not even when friends have been present so I do think its important to challenge those kind of attitudes when encountered.

There is money left in UK oil and gas but not much there have been major tax incentives just to keep them working in our bit of sea TLDR we had lots of oil revenues were not properly managed we now have a lot less oil therefore no matter the tax system funds will be a lot less.

Gay fathers still require females to fulfil the biological role of mothers.  Its quite possible that this would be amongst close friends.  Mundell and his wife clearly got along.  It would have to be someone why not her?  Only someone lacking an imagination could fail to conceive a situation where those genes could still have mixed.  gtThe joke is therefore talking about the fact that Mundel is gay. But it doesnt poke fun at Mundell or homosexuality. It doesnt say he wrong to be in the closet or to come out. It says absolutely nothing about it. It is not attacked. Its therefore not homosexual.It doesnt necessarily have to be directly denigrating homosexuality just using that information inappropriately.  Inappropriate use of sexual information has been part of the oppression of gay people.

We shouldnt want to be as free to make short sighted and ill informed decisions as the UK did with the EU.Imagine how bitter that divide will be when a new country is to be founded by a majority that slim. Brexit has split Britain right down the middle in quite an ugly fashion but I guarantee this will be worse if a similar thing happens. I couldnt care less about what is seen as fair I care about good governance and stability which we wont get with a narrow independence vote. The flag that flies and the national anthem matter very little to me Im totally open to Scotland gradually becoming independent in say  years. If it happens too fast though it will become bitter. It already is. I used to argue it had ended amicably but in the years since Ive felt the political landscape in this country turn evermore sour.Whats more if you do it that way and its a close loss for Yes then the question still wont have been put to bed because it wouldnt be a real victory for No either.

In fact if we are honest the nation thats not a functional democracy in the UK is England. No other nation lacks its own devolved institutions no other nation has the other parts of the UK able to block legislation by MPs not in that nation as the SNP have done several times already.I dont mind public opinion being polled and for policy setting yes it probably should be done more often in a meaningful manner some countries poland I believe but Id have to check has policy referendums every year and has mature informative campaigns to educate rather than deceive as the brexit and indyref did here on both sides the population.But other countries also have a much more sensible approach to sweeping constitutional change requiring a larger majority than a simple majority as these things are important and long lasting and should not be judged on small margins which change frequently. The very fact the people can suggest opinion has changed by a few  and should rerun the ref is in itself an arguemetn that its an absurd thing to do. What happens a few months later when opinion polls show it would go the other way by ....The will of the Scottish people was to be part of the UK they knew that involved collective decision making I dont assume they were stupid or naive they knew how the country works. They opted for that. In that system some things go your way some dont but thats collective decision making thats what Scotland opted for.as for time limits. Ernest Renan is talking bullshit. I dont care that youll tell me who he is and how highly regarded he is that a stupid position. Democracy is not just having the people express an opinion its enacting it its a covenant between teh people to be informed and make informed decisions and the government to give them those decisions AND ACT ON THEM. Without that there is no democracy there is just an eternal poll and no delivery. policy with no delivery is not expressing the will of the people.The Scottish people were voting for a generational decision to stay or leave the UK. They voted to stay the democratic mandate was given the democratic action is to follow through on that. To say we dont agree lets go again is anti democratic and betrays the trust in teh population and treats the electorate as children unable to make decisions and who must be asked again and again until they agree with you.I have faith the Scottish people knew the risks and opportunities of a yes or no vote they weighted them up they knew the uncertainties and that there were unknowns and decided on balance to stay in the UK. Maybe I have more faith and respect for the ability and right to determine their future of the Scottish people than you.

I wonder what figures from this years report will be changed in ?gtSo its an irrelavent criticism of the current GERS figures.You give Bob a task to do where he needs to speak with Jill to get all the accounts information and then use that information along with a bunch of other stuff to run a report. You find out he manged to come up with the report without the information from Jill. It looks right but you cant be sure because nobody else has the right information.. all you know is that he didnt get the numbers from Jill.You manage to convince Bob that he needs to speak with Jill in the future but youre uneasy.. you dont know what else he is missing since he obviously failed so badly at the very first step. You also know that Bob has in the past tried to use the report to make his own department look better than it actually is.Saying its irrelevant is clearly misleading every year parts of the report are revised to be more accurate. Often times this can result in a large change that affects the bottom line. The fact this needs to happen on a regular basis at all is indicative that even more criticism needs to be levied on the newer reports to ensure their voracity.Im not saying that revisions shouldnt happen and Im glad they do but what I am saying is that when you see utterly basic mistakes like the Olympics happen and have to be penciled in later it doesnt exactly inspire confidence in the current report does it?,Scotland,df6zwco,1,t5_2qkli
11253046,0,t1_df787kb,Thank you for the response! What Im finding quite interesting is that both you and my father when arguing over the policy idea both agree in the idea of people becoming dependant on government welfare yet of course you disagree with the policy where he agreed. My first question would be thenIs this idea of basic welfare of giving people the boot to pull up the bootstraps by so to speak a negotiable position within the Conservative platform?I ask the question because the current SNP policy appears unrealiable granting Headmasters directable funding in whether it will be properly executed upon whereas we both agree that breakfast is valuable. More concretely is this policy Im entertaining one that might be favoured better by a party over than the SNPConservatives?There is also two things Id like to respond to more directly for debate. First would you consider the policy to be interesting if applied more selectively to the  student body? If not what alternative would you suggest to closing the attainment gap as the SNP say. The reason why I investigated this policy was that while radical it did seem something capable of receiving crossparty support as while the SNP are focused on the attainment gap I also see in the Conservative manifesto a comment on school meals presumably lunchs stating the cost of a good meal being between . and . and also stating seperately in promoting the purchase of local farming goods. Ergo my last question would be do you think that the Conservatives would be interested in the potential for crossover in solving these manifesto aims?Otherwise I thank you for the response so far having a teacher when discussing educational policy is absolutely valuable. Do hope you can respond further.,Scotland,df7il71,1,t5_2qkli

I know the why or at least I think I do and you dont seem to be offering any other reason I just dont agree with it being publicly funded at all again unless someone can provide an actual reason. Im not in favour of the NHS funding things that arent actually about a persons health unless there was some overriding public benefit involved. And I as Im sure you can guess dont see having children as some inalienable right.  For example I would be absolutely against the NHS offering artificial insemination for single women or artificial gestation is that the right word? for single men and I dont think I would get much protest to that opinion. I reckon its a bit daft to compare not being able to conceive a child with being alive and not having an arm. Thats an incredible leap rather than a natural conclusion. Perhaps I can see it in the chemo example youve given although I havent thought about that much as I guess youre just in a roundabout way alleviating a symptom of chemo or removing a reason that might make someone not want to go through chemo. However thats not what this is about. Its about offering  rounds of it to anyone who cant naturally conceive. ,Scotland,dfczyix,5,t5_2qkli

But here Im merely pointing out the legal position.And just because Pensioners are private citizens they do not have any less rights than International Banks and Finance Houses who buy UK Government Bonds.  They are still Creditors.  Creditors with a legal right to be paid which the UK government cannot avoid with Legislation which generally cannot be retrospective in regards to contracts.And there are plenty of people who would be in a position to enforce the agreement.  Internally the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom would almost certainly enforce it if they tried to welch.Additionally it would also have a significant knock on effect to the Credit Rating of the rUK.There is only ONE way for the rUK to avoid these liabilities.

11617489,0,t1_dgbsu1p,And oh so glorious sir please tell us dumb poor folks what the poor people will do in our ever advancing society when we cant access education to learn how to read and write? Im too dumb and poor to know unless you tell me sir. In a society that is increasingly service based and requires a fairly significant amount of education to even do what are all the uneducated poor to do? Are you going to pay them benefits to exist and do nothing to pay you back? Surely not! So are they to starve?  No? So a basic benefit system to keep them alive but doing nothing to help society. Ok. Oh and while all these uneducated poor are around... who will help do the jobs that you need done? Call centres need people who can read and write a lot of them also require basic mathematical knowledge and you aint getting that unless you go to school. Especially since as we all know English is a fairly complex language compared to things like Korean which you can probably learn to read and write in a day of dedicated practice. God only knows you Tories dont want shudders FOREIGNERS doing the call centre work for your banks or insurance you cant understand THEIR kind so it has to be in the UK. But if youll take a jaunt over to rtalesfromcallcenters youll see that theyre shit jobs that pay worse and no middleclass or above person will do it so its full of GASP! THE POOR! Hilariously enough the same applies for the majority of shitty service jobs that you wouldnt be caught fucking dead doing. They all need education to do. If the poor cant do them through lack of education then we need to take in more immigrants who also have families and then they have kids who they cant send to school and the problem escalates. Furthermore crime SKYROCKETS because hey fuck it Im poor dumb and have no job prospects. Might as well turn to crime least if I go to fuckin jail Ill get education food a bed and some structure in life. If I dont get caught then I have money to get those things. Its a winwin situation. And if you say that Oh well make jail really brutal so you dont want to go there then you introduce yet another issue... I need to commit crime and a cop catches me jail is horrid and Ill likely die there so its me or the cop... sorry copper you dead now son. Nothing personal old chap. I cant believe you actually believe that free education is ANYTHING other than a net positive for society. So educate me oh great and wonderful sir with all the answers. Tell me how it would be any different from the above?
