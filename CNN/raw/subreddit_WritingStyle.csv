My theory was they just thought they cared nothing about anything but the action that really although they didnt know it they cared very little about the action. The things they really cared about and that I cared about were the creation of emotion through dialogue and description the things they remembered that haunted them were not for example that a man got killed but that in the moment of his death he was trying to pick a paper clip up off the polished surface of a desk and it kept slipping away from him so that there was a look of strain on his face and his mouth was half open in a kind of tormented grin and the last thing in the world he thought about was death. He didnt even hear death knock on the door. That damn little paper clip kept slipping away from his fingers and he just wouldnt push it to the edge of the desk and catch it as it fell.,WritingStyle,chcrhp7,1,t5_2wy5j
