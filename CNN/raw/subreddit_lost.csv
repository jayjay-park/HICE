That sounds more like Walt is supposed to be the new Juliet i.e. someone with special skills recruited to the island to take care of a specific problem. With Juliet it was the pregnancy problem. With Walt its the ghosts inability to move on.I like to think that Walt would eventually become the new Benleader of the Others since Jacob had wanted him to be an Other originally but I dont think theres anything to suggest that Walt was intended to take Hurleys place especially since the epilogue seems to take place almost right after Jack dies.,lost,cg2tdni,6,t5_2qhag

I remember an interview with the writers that I actually use quite a lot in debates on this subreddit where they said that this was inteded to be the answer for why Claire was kidnapped. I guess you could say its a little understandable to not know if its true or not just by watching the show but they do try their best to make it seem true. They use flashbacks that actually happened as shes explaining it you know Juliet is not lying about studying pregnant women and in a flashback in this very episode theres this exchangegt BEN You need to stay here until your work is finished.gt gt JULIET Its impossible.

953516,0,t3_251979,The whole show had a decent number of errors like this many of which were caught and edited out for DVD release. I think in the specific case of season  the writers strike must have affected production. The industry knew about it long before it started so I imagine they tried to get as much done in as short a timeframe as possible before the strike then after it ended because the strike had gone on for so long the season was shortened by several episodes in order to get it completed on time. Filming was probably just as tight. Everything ran at doubletime during season  which Id assume led to a higher incidence of production errorsshortcuts.,lost,chco8ef,3,t5_2qhag

Again Im just going based off what the writers said in their podcast in their minds he could take the forms of living people too. Not taking over their living bodies mind you just creating a lookalike like he did with Locke Isabella etc. He does it with a person whos almost certainly alive a least once and that wasnt even really early on it was in season three when they had already explicitly established he could take the form of dead people.Honestly like I said I wish it was categorical that he could only show up as dead people thats just not what the writers ended up doing. Hes showing up as dead people living people friggin insects in Expos Im still iritated that they did that so unnecessary!.

Both are shows about people confined to close quarters with an assortment of other people unable to leave and forced to learn how to live with one another.

When they first introduced her in Flashes Before your Eyes they clearly intended for her to be kind if mystical not exactly a real person. In their podcast they described her as something like A spokesperson for the universe. Then after they started really getting into the time travel thing they decided to bring her back probably figuring that her connection to Dan would be enough to explain her knowledge and kind of hoping the audience wouldnt remember the specifics. I kind of wish they hadnt done that and had just cast someone else to be the Eloise Hawking character.But if you want a fantheory explanation I can think of  Dan and Desmond bonded over time travel maybe Desmond mentioned the encounter to Dan and he wrote it on his journal offscreeen.

Personally I dont discount mythological as in folklore and myths not LOSTspecific mysteries explanations.  The show is rife with mythological as in folklore allusions.  Not crazy at all. Thing is though with Ethans birth  if Ethans mother had shown the same pattern as later Other women did then by the middle to the end of the the second trimester she should have died.

He was actually hearing her talk about the vending machine she meets Saywer at. The vending machine itself is an analogy for the island. If you unplug uncork the vending machine island the candy MIB as Locke just drops right down. This means that MIB is no longer part of the island and is vulnerable. And its technically legal ie not against the rules. You are right about Ben wanting to spend more time with Alex. There are a lot of different elements to moving on from the flashsideways. Its not just as simple as meeting someone important to you you also have to make spiritual progress. Jack dealing with his father issues Locke letting go of his guilt about his father etc. Once that has happened and they meet the right person they can move on.

2140808,0,t3_2ji34x,First thinggtI know Jacob brought people to the island to find a replacement for himself.This whole thing is all about a sort of philosophical debate between the brothers. The Man in Black thinks that people are bad while Jacob thinks that people are good. Basically its the whole everlasting question of the nature of man being good or evil. Jacob brings them there to prove that theyre good but when he gets them there The Man in Black corrupts or outright kills them. The Man in Blacks interference with these people is brought up when Richard shows up. Richard asks Jacob why Jacob doesnt interfere since he knows that his brother will. This is when Jacob takes Richard on as a sort of intermediary between Jacob and those who are brought to the island.The survivors of Flight  are brought to the island in search of a replacement but the ones before that seem to be more about this general disagreement about the nature of humans.Now with that said your other questions about this probably answer themselves a little bit but if not...gtCan someone explain to me why Jacob through Richard had any need of Ben and the others? ... What do the others have to do with this? Where did they fit into the plan? They were all brought over that original dispute between the brothers or from DHARMA in Bens case. Its not so much that Jacob needed them for anything specific. In a way they like many before them were like ants in the farm for Jacob and his brother to watch and mess with.gtAnd on a side note was MIB being in Jacobs cabin towards the end there meant to suggest that perhaps some people who thought they were taking orders from Jacob were actually taking them from MIB?That seems to be the case.,lost,clbxzq2,5,t5_2qhag

2414212,0,t1_cma3k25,I think the island absolutely needed them to leave the island in order to come back and save it. Claire is largely irrelevant in the bigger picture except for that she inspires Kate to come back. But then you also have the catch  effect if they never left Locke wouldnt have been killed MIB wouldnt have been able to kill Jacob and the island might not need saving in the first place. I feel like turning off the jammer represents a break in the stalemate between Jacob and MIB To quote Game of Thrones chaos is a ladder and the chaos of disrupting the Looking Glass jammer became a race between Jacob and MIB to see who could get to the top.So I guess what I mean to say is the island needed things to progress for good or bad and Charlie was the only person who could make that happen at that time. But the island had a history of bringing musicians to its shores so youd have to figure it was something that the island wanted to happen for a while and it gave Desmond the gift to allow that to happen.,lost,cma3t2l,2,t5_2qhag

2648515,0,t1_cn491ft,Thats actually not true though totally understandable why someone would think it a lot of Lost fans pass it around without realizing. IMDB is counting the number of times an actor is credited not the number of times they actually appear. Meaning that for the main stars it will count every episode of a season even if the character doesnt appear in all of them. For example Henry Ian Cusick Desmond was credited as a main character in season six so on IMDB hes credited as appearing in all  episodes but other than a cameo in the premier he doesnt even show up until halfway through the season and only appears in  of them.  The reason some actors are shown as appearing in more than others is if they were credited as in bonus material like the mobisodes or that epilogue.Some very hardworking fans at Lostpedia compiled the actual numbers and put them together in this article So really of the  episodes Hurley appeared in  of them missing . It makes me sad to say but Jack really did appear in the most though he misses his fair share too appearing in  and missing . Keep in mind these are just raw appearances it counts even if a character walks by in the background for a second so it doesnt automatically reflect actual importance to the story. I really do like it just how many episodes characters miss it really does validate OPs point that there really is no one main character in the traditional sense and I really like that about this show Edit Heres a fun and handy chart of how many episodes each character appeared in.

2873182,0,t1_cnuns2i,gt if Malkin really was a psychic and all of a sudden he had this miraculous proof from his daughter he wouldnt take that opportunity to suddenly start lying he could use the opportunity to show hes not crazy and a fraud and learn more and help more people.But we have no evidence that Richard wants to disprove the idea that hes not crazy or a fraud. What we do see however is Richard trying to keep his daughters resurrection a secret. He lied about his daughter in order to keep Eko from investigating. And to make his lie more convincing he came up with the idea that his wife didnt actually believe it was a miracle either but that she had lied in order to embarrass him when we know that the wife believed it actually was a real miracle. So regardless of whether Richard is a fraud or not the most logical conclusion is that he lied to Eko about Charlotte and his wife. If hes lying about  of the  things hes saying and at least one of those lies is being strengthened by the third thing hes saying wouldnt that give more credence to the idea that the third thing is a lie itself?So as a writer I would have included that fraud admission in there regardless of whether it was or wasnt true simply because it gives Eko a logical reason to turn around and stop investigating something that Richard clearly doesnt want him investigating. And note that Richard doesnt want Eko investigating something that is actually very much worth investigating... If I was a writer on Lost it wouldnt be the first time someone wrote a red herring into the script.You do bring up a good point about the deleted scene but I also have to think that it might have been deleted for continuity reasons as well. We have to remember how adamant Richard was that Claire keep the baby. Then when he finally changed his mind he forced Claire to take Flight  as opposed to any other flight. On top of that he promised Claire  plus airfare to deliver Aaron to the couple in LA which would have severely cut into his profit if the couple only paid him .Of course its entirely possible that the couple was real AND Richards vision was real. Richard could have been tempted enough by his  profit that he decided to convince Claire to give the baby up after all even knowing that something bad would happen if she did. Maybe he even knew about Flight  crashing so he made sure Claire got on that plane so he could both get his money for doing what the couple wanted and make sure Claire didnt give up Aaron.gtThink about it if you were the writers and you did want to drop the psychicAaron plotline what would you do?I would have had Richard appear and say he was a fraud in a context where it was clear he was being honest about being a fraud and never bring up the Aaron cant be raised by anyone else idea ever again. I understand the writers failing on one of those but failing on both leaves me suspicious. However given that the plot line was entirely dropped after Season  that tells me that the writers at least retroactively decided that Malkin really was a fraud but it doesnt say anything for the idea that they had planned him being a fraud from the beginning.,lost,cnuojor,2,t5_2qhag

Remember the runway was built on Hydra Island.gtAlso didnt this tiny plane set off from Nigeria? And crashed in the middle of the Pacific? Surely a plane that size would not have that kind of range...was any information given about this that Ive missed or am I being overlycritical?As others have pointed out the Island appeared to move in space across the globe.Consider that the Nigerian plane was but one of a handful of crafts to crash on the Island following a flash.We see the Nigerian plane crash immediately after a flash.Danielles crew also crashed immediately following a flash.We also see the statue in the distance during one of the flashes before Locke stabilizes the wheel.

What about the button? dude the button kept all of that energy that was released at the end of season . That energy wouldve killed everyone if the button wasnt pressed every  minutes to contain it the only reason it didnt is because Desmond switched the failsafe. The smoke monster was Jacobs brother and became the monster after Jacob threw him into the heart of the island. The pregnancies are explained in The New Man in Charge.

And he reacted angrily stubbornly to that with his famous sevenword saying.

When the Island gave him his legs back he relished in the freedom he got his walkabout and he believed correctly that he and the rest of them were brought there for a reason.

3907099,0,t1_cr1cbcw,Its so refreshing to read a discussion about Jack that isnt all about how much the fans hate him.  Which has gotten to be as old as time.  Jack does have an earnestness to his persona when it comes to the opposite sex.  While he is a complex character he does have this what you see is what you get approachability to him.  And I think a confident woman will be drawn to a man that doesnt have to lay it on thick to get her to be interested.  As a female I also found Sawyer to be too much at times the constant sexual innuendo the tackles the grab and kiss were all out a corny romance novel to me.  He had the long locks and the unbuttoned shirt too.  All that was missing was the ripping of the bodice.  Sawyer is very handsome but his brooding squinting and flaring nostrils were unintentionally humorous.  Like the other person said there were moments when he was adorable and I loved it when Sawyer let his guard down BUT only when it seemed less contrived.  The Awww.  Sawyer is holding Aaron.  How cute. thing never won me over.  Sawyer made me like him when he would show the human side of him.  And no scene shows that better than the scene when he tells Jack that he met Christian in Sydney.  I think that is one of the best scenes in the entire series tbh.  Sawyer had no real like for Jack but he knew that if he didnt tell Jack what Christian said Jack could very well die believing that his father hated him.  Sawyer could have let his envy and rivalry over Kate win over and make him keep it a secret but instead he let his decency and empathy override his selfish urges.  And what came out was beautiful.  ,lost,cr1n6s2,2,t5_2qhag

As protector of the island the Mother and Jacob are able to use the powers of the Source. Theoretically the protector of the island has all the same powers that the smoke monster has.

I may be wrong.My impressions was that the save the world thing was some hyperbole invented by Inman and passed down to Desmond then from him to Jack Locke et. al. It became shorthand for the question of whether the button actually did anything important or if it was just an experiment to see how long people would blindly push it. It ended up being both. Pushing the button didnt save the world but it did prevent electromagnetic energy from building up to critical mass in the pocket underneath the Swan. The whole point of the button in the second season outside of the scifi trappings of the show was a debate over faith.

4488600,0,t3_3ckq1t,Nah the island wasnt heaven or purgatory or anything like that it was a legit island and they were alive hence Christian saying to Jack youre real everything that happened to you is real the connections you all made on the island were real etc. The island is a special place which houses the source of life and must be protected because if that light goes out it goes out everywhere which means either the end of the world or at least everyone turning evil like when Sayid and Claire went to the dark side. The island has generally had a Protector for as long as its existed someone to protect the Source. When our timeline starts its the Mother. She had Jacob powers and Smoke Monster powers which seems to be how its supposed to be. She adopted Jake and MIB and planned to make MIB the next Protector. But he was not willing to stay on the island and take the job from her by drinking the water so she had to give the job to Jacob instead. But she still wanted MIB to stay alive and on the island so she manipulated things so that they would split the powers and MIB would be the Smoke Monster trapped on the island but immortal and Jacob would keep him from leaving in her absence while guarding the Source.For  years the two of them fought over the nature of humanity. MIB said humans were inherently evil and greedy beyond help. Jacob said they were ultimately good and that he would prove it. So he kept bringing people to the island for thousands of years and they formed various cults following Jacob from Egyptians who built him statues and things to the Others of the modern day led by Ben. He brought the Black Rock to the Island and Henry Gales balloon and Yemis plane and Oceanic  all because you cannot find the island unless Jacob wants you to or you have the right compass bearing. For  years these groups failed. MIB would kill them off after they showed their true nature was bad and Jacob would say aw shucks next time I guess and bring more people to the island. Oceanic crashed and MIB launched a plan to finally get off of the island and kill Jacob. Jacob had a bunch of people on Oceanic who were Candidates to take his job over and Smoke Monster tried to get them to kill themselves off indirectly since he cant actively kill a Candidate. This includes appearing as Christian Shepherd in episode  to try to get Jack to run off a cliff and appearing as Dave to Hurley to make him question his sanity. Most of these attempts failed.MIBs original plan involved guilt. He had Christian and Yemi as his disposal and tested out Jack and Ekos guilt about the deaths by appearing as those folks. Jack was immediately too headstrong and stubborn to be MIBs pawn but Eko felt very guilty for Yemi and always questioned if he was a good person. MIB planned to appear as Yemi a ton and use Ekos guilt to manipulate him ultimately into killing Jacob I imagine.But then Eko found redemption he realized that the life he led and the people he killed were all the result of a truly selfless choice he made in childhood where he saved Yemi from living this life by killing a man for him. That lets Eko decide that he is a good person that he saved his brother and he lets go of his guilt and simultaneously has no baggage. The Island has no use for him because the Protector has to be damaged in some way they have to have baggage Jacob None of you were happy in life you needed this place as much as it needed you. and MIB has no use for him since hes not guilty over Yemi and is a big strong leader type. So he kills him.MIB then does the plan with Ben instead after Alex dies. He appears as Christian to get Locke to bring the Candidates back and to die. Then he appears as Alex to tell Ben to listen to everything John Locke really MIB himself says. MIB as Locke then gets Ben to kill Jacob before revealing himself to be the Smoke Monster.From there the Smoke Monster is trying to kill Jack Sawyer Sayid Hurley Jin and Sun but cant do so directly and needs them to kill themselves or be killed by someone else. If he does so he can leave the island. Theyre trying to stop him obvs.At the end he kills  of them and then Jack takes on the Jacob powers. They use Desmond to unpull the Cork the thing keeping the island in place causing it to sink into the ocean which will put out the Source and end the world. While this is going on the islands rules are all gone and Jack and MIB are just humans. They fight and MIB gets killed by Jack and Kate. Jack then makes this epic heroic sacrifice as hes dying by going down to the Cork and braving the electromagnetism to put it back in saving the Island and Existence. And then everyone else leaves on a plane and Jack dies. And Hurley takes over as the new Jacob with Ben as his number . IN the Epilogue they go get Walt from Santa Rosa and imply that hell take over as the new JacobJackHurley so that he can help Michael stop being a Whisper.FLASH SIDEWAYS PART IMPORTANTAfter everyone died Shannon when Ana shot her Jack when the MIB stabbed him Kate and Sawyer probably  years later off the island Hurley a hundred years after that or more etc. they created a Purgatory type of thing the FlashSideways. It was a place where they could cycle through some of their old baggage and anything they wished had gone differently in their lives before letting go and moving on together. Jack gets to meet his son and work through some of his own issues with his dad Locke gets to be married to Helen Sawyer and Miles are cops instead of con men Hurley is really lucky etc. They use the place to reunite with the people they loved and lost Hurley and Libby Sawyer and Juliet Jack and Kate etc. then as Christian says they all come together to move on to whatever the afterlife will be. TLDR Everything before the plane crash and on the island up to Jack dying really happened. The FlashSideways takes place long after that when everyone is dead and is the Purgatory thing where they reunite remember and move on. Island was super real and Jack Kate and Desmond saved all of existence by defeating the Black Smoke a monster created indirectly by Mother because she loved him so much that she never wanted him to leave and directly by Jacob who was just a pawn in Mothers scheme.,lost,cswg7lk,40,t5_2qhag

5106593,0,t1_cv1ii2d,Its a popular misconception that when the plane originally crashed there were zero survivors and everyone was dead the whole time. As far as I can tell there are a few factors that lead to this Mainly ABC thought it would be weird to cut directly to commercials after the ending with Jack dying to save the island. So without consulting Damon or Carlton ABC decided to add in still images of the crash from the first season as a buffer between then end of the episode and commercials. Some viewers interpreted those ending shots to mean that everyone died in the crash and that everything on the show happened in their minds in the final seconds of life. source Combined with the flash sideways that turned out to be a place where everyone meets when they eventually die you can kind of see how those two things got jumbled together even more by people who stopped watching the show and then only heard things second hand. It also doesnt help that an early theory before it was shot down was that everyone was dead and the island was purgatory.,lost,cv1ja7y,8,t5_2qhag

5216156,0,t3_3mf7j1,Here are your answers OPgt How did Jacob know Nadia?Jacob was studying all his candidates a lot offscreen he knew about Nadia through being around Sayid.gtWhy was Libby in the mental institute in the flashback before she was shot by Michael?Libby was married to a guy called David but then he died she went a little loopy  this is why shes seen in Santa Rosa with Hurley. Her dead husband David was the same Dave that Hurley was seeing in Santa Rosa. Libby was fond of Hurley because she saw him hanging around this guy called Dave which reminded her of her husband  and over time she cleans up and got out of the hospital.gt Was Jacobs brother really Jacobs brother after he was thrown into the light tunnel? Or something more evil hence the black smoke?Essentially yes. The body fused with the electromagnetism and his soul went into the black smoke creation the original body was left limp and dead. Smokey still had the same consciousness of the original Man in Black.gt I assume that the side timeline was some kind of purgatory whilst those people waited for everyone else to die? Either way if Jack and Juliet got married and had a life together why were they not together at the end with Jack and Kate and Sawyer and Juliet being together?The FlashSideways what you called the side timeline was some kind of inbetween stage between reality and the proper afterlife. I think Jack and Juliet being put together in unseen scenes and divorced is the shows way of conveying their actual relationship on the Island which was had a connection not technically together. Jack is with Kate in the end and Sawyer with Juliet because theyre each others soul mates and true loves. Heres an interesting tidbit about the JackKateSawyerJuliet love quadrangle its two doctors and two outlaws and the doctors being paired with the outlaws I feel is natural and realistic as if they complete each other.gt Were the othersnatives brought to the island by Jacob or the man in black? For what reason?By Jacob mainly via Richard. Some of them were likely to have been Candidates the rest were just devout followers of Jacob and the Island there to help Richard with Jacobs long term plan  protect the Island and bring the Candidates. Also some like Juliet were brought for research and their expertise.gt If Mr Eko was on the plane you could assume he was a candidate. If so how was Smokey able to kill him? The submarine explosive leads you to think that FLocke cannot kill Candidates.Youre right the MIB cant directly kill the Candidates but Ekos case was particularly unique. The MIBs original plan involved guilt. He had Yemis form at his disposal and tested out and Ekos guilt about his death by appearing to him as Yemi. Eko felt very guilty for Yemi and a large part of his character always questioned if he was a good person.The MIBs longterm plan was to appear as Yemi a lot more and use Ekos guilt to manipulate him ultimately killing Jacob. But then Eko found redemption he realized that the life he led and the people he killed were all the result of a truly selfless choice he made in childhood where he saved Yemi from living this life by killing a man for him. That lets Eko decide that he is a good person and that from his perspective he saved his brother so he lets go of his guilt and simultaneously has no more baggage. This leads the MIB to kill him.So how was it the MIB was able to kill Eko when he was listed as a Candidate? Eko was killed by the Monster because he failed to atone for or admit to his past sins. In SE Eko was scanned and then he was judged in SE just as Ben was in SE. Unlike Ben Eko refused to admit fault and take responsibility for his sins. So having judged Eko guilty the Monster was able to kill him.gt Why did Ben not go in with everyone else at the end? Was he only there to see Locke and Hurley assuming those two had a long reign on the island together? Do you think Alex Danielle and Ben ever had a long life together following when Ben went round for dinner and Rousseau gives him sexy eyes saying that he was like a father to Alex?You kinda answered your own question P Christian says to Jack the most important part of your life was the time you spent with these people. Everyone in the church at the end had big impacts on each others lives. Ben didnt go into the church because he wanted to spend more time with Alex and Rousseau and in time move on with them  because Alex was the most important part of his life not our castaways despite spending a bunch of time with Hurley postfinale so he still felt he should say a proper goodbyegt If Sayid was so different and emotionaless after being brought back to life in the temple why was he still the good guy to take his own life on the submarine?Sayid wasnt totally gone he still had shreds of the old him left in his final moments. On that sub he takes a look at the bigger picture and realises when looking at his friends that it cant end like this and Jack needs to be the new Jacob  telling him Desmonds location and making his sacrifice.gt If Kate and Sawyer made it off the island at the end as Jack sees when he is lying with Vincent how does FlashSideways Sawyer and the real Sawyer tie in together... Do they all become one at death?When Jack dies in the forest next thing he knows he just wakes up on  in the FS. To quote Christian There is no now here the concept of time is ambiguous in the FlashSideways when people die whenever they wouldve died they go to the FS. Think of it like their characters are in the FS are paused until the real character dies.Hope this cleared up a few things and Ill be happy to try and answer any other queries you may have ,lost,cveqmkc,5,t5_2qhag

My problem that Ive been railing against is that were never given a clear enough indication of what the stakes are in the end. With the hatch Kelvin says that electromagnetism builds up and has to be discharged or it will destroy the world and we see what happens when the button isnt pushed and that its effects are visible even off the island. With the cork though the monster seems to think that it will just destroy the island and the rest of the world will be all right.

6720194,0,t3_47mit1,Off the top of my headSeason  I know it couldnt be done since they werent created back then but redshirt scenes with Nikki and Paulo would help a lot for us accepting them as part of the group. Would still kill them off in Expos since that was perfectSeason  The imploded hatch looks great in LA X but is a cheap CGIeffect in Further Instructions. If they had the gravelike set from season  I would like to see them excavating a bit before moving on to find Eko. I feel like they all just forgot about The Swan too quickly in season . Somewhere in season  possibly at the start of Catch since it alludes to Penelope coming to the island they should go back to that end scene from the season  finale. It could answer where in the world they are. We see that the phone call gets a little bit longer. Maybe something refering to the freighter? And then bth Henrik and Mathias are going to catch the next ferry. Snow storm is getting bad. Maybe theres already a bit of tension between them and heck maybe one of them betrays the other? Which makes us question if Penny will every find the Island. Did she get the coordinates?Season  Something I anticipated but didnt happen would be a memorial statue for Oceanic Flight  somewhere in LA. You know those types that lists all the names of the passengers. It could be an interesting thing to have Kate walk up to it in Eggtown and seeing Edward Mars name on it. A nice silent and reflective moment.Season  I feel like we needed a couple of scenes where Jack is a mess. He went pretty fast from drugpopping bearded alcoholic to sober handsome action hero. A couple of scenes with rings around his eyes sweat and driving while listening to grunge. We already had Nirvana and Pixies. We couldve had Alice in Chains too. Live performance by Geronimo Jackson. Would be perfect at the recruitment day in Namaste. In The Variable we couldve had one of the flashbacks set in Ann Arbor. Shown what Daniel Faraday was doing there at the headquarters. Then we could see the DeGroots.Season  Its not really a new scene but an extension of the whisper reveal. When Hurley thinks he knows that they are he walks through the bushes and ends up at the site with the ancient Roman pillar from The Brig. He sees Michael there and then a lot of other people show up around him. Some familiar faces. Maybe a very old Radzinsky? Or Nikki and Paulo? Then he realizes that they are all the whisperers. The ones who cant move on. I feel like the scene would have more impact then instead of just through dialogue. The outrigger chase is perfect in Everybody Loves Hugo for Ilanas death scene. She wants to go to The Black Rock to find more dynamite. Someone says it would be faster by sea. She and a couple of main characters including Miles take the outrigger. She sees Locke on the boat on the other side thinking its MIB while in fact its the real John Locke in the other boat. Shoots at him. Miles says Hold on a minute... realizing what this whole thing is and then she gets shot and the boat vanishes. She lands in Bens arms and says something important. Theres a lot more to the ancient times of The Island that would be cool to explore. Like an Across the Sea Part  where we see all of the structures being built and the different civilizations there.Other Not necessary scenes but more stories and flesh to Widmore Eloise Abaddon Ilana etc.  The Tampa job and Basra incident would be cool The life in The Swan with Kelvin and Radzinsky.  Radzinskys suicide or did he? DHARMAs experiments on the frozen wheel. Sending polar bears to Tunisia DHARMAs first encounter on The Island The DHARMA Initiative Hanso Group inspections Henry Gale arriving on The Island Huge CGIscene which would be extremely hard but the actual crash of the fuselage for Flight .,lost,d0efcq2,10,t5_2qhag

7681610,0,t3_4kgebq,When the writers created Radzinsky he was supposed to be some guy like Kelvin who was recruited from the outside world and brought to the island to push the button. He didnt know anything more about what was going on so he started going out and exploring the island by himself and created a map of it on the blast door. The writers themselves confirmed this in a special feature on the Season  bluray.Then two years later when they were writing Season  they decided to ignore that idea and put Radzinsky in the show as fanservice even though it made no sense based on what they had already established because everyone always wanted to see him. ,lost,d3fcp5l,3,t5_2qhag

7724123,0,t1_d3jjza0,A lot of the shows downturn in its second half can be traced back to two factors the  Writers Guild Strike and ABCs agreement to end the show three years in advance.People seem to love season  for some reason but I think its one of the shows worst and a lot of that is because of how much material the writers strike forced them to cut out that they never made up for. We lost a Ben flashback episode that would have filled in the rest of his back story his relationship with Juliet what happened to his childhood friend Annie why he singled out Horace during the Purge to respectfully close his eyes why he spent so much time and effort trying to solve the Others fertility crisis. All of that went unaddressed leaving a ton of dangling plot threads not just in Bens story but in the plot of the show as a whole.Libby was supposed to appear again not just in a onesecond vision to Michael on the freighter. The second season stinger of her watching Hurley in the mental ward would have been resolved probably through the Daniel and Miles flashback episodes that we also lost. Along with that Daniel episode we lost the resolution to The Constants cliffhanger with Daniel writing Desmond Hume will be my constant in his journal. Michaels whole redemption arc was brutally truncated to the point that he basically dies almost immediately after he returns to the island. Mira Furlan asked to be written off the show but Rousseaus abrupt death at the end of the final episode aired before the hiatus was likely another result of the impending strike as the writers had often talked about doing a flashback episode for the French woman and killing her off instead of having her go into hiding again guaranteed that could never happen.Not to mention little things like someone warning Sayid dont trust the captain which makes no sense in the poststrike episodes where the captain is the most trustworthy person on the ship. In a lot of ways the show never fully recovered from the damage the writers strike caused during season .As for ABC allowing Damon and Carlton to end the show after six seasons this was the right choice and ABC isnt to blame for how that decision ending up hurting the quality of the show. Thats Damon and Carltons fault for not taking the time they were given three years!! to plan out the remaining seasons overarching plot and structure in advance.In seasons  aka the good ones the writers were pretty much winging it. A lot was made up as they went along and although they  introduced major gamechanging elements of the mythology from time to time they could never plan more than a season in advance because they didnt know how much longer ABC would keep renewing the show. Occasionally youd wind up with tedious lulls in momentum like the Hydra arc in early season  but for the most part the fact that the show was forced to take its time is what gave us so many great character stories and story arcs in those first few years. Darlton said that if theyd been in control of the show from the beginning they might not even have done the hatch story. Think of what a loss that would have been.So when Darlton brokered a deal with ABC to produce three more shortened seasons of Lost it meant sacrificing that wideangle lens of storytelling but in return we should have gotten a tighter more focused plot that brought us back on track to the conclusion wed been building to since day one and resolved everything that needed to be resolved along the way.But for some reason they didnt do that. Instead they ignored many of the remaining mystery hooks set up in seasons  along with vast swaths of the mythology which they seemed to rewrite between every new season if not during each season. Notice how there are way more retcons and contradictions in seasons  which the writers had three years to plan than in  which they more or less made up as they went along? When things would change before it was so gradual you could almost believe it had been intended to be that way all along the Others transformation from supernatural jungle ninjas to ordinary people living in houses. Then in the later seasons youd be told one thing in one episode only to see it blatantly contradicted a little bit later in the season.I still love the show and the final episode itself is one of its very best in my opinion but it cant be said enough how much the last three seasons despite the occasional brilliant episode failed to live up to their own potential.,lost,d3k6guo,0,t5_2qhag

I have done a lot of rewatches on Netflix in the meantime so in addition to it being so many years ago I also have that working against me.I guess I wanted more island than not island.  So to see a bunch of people in the church threw me off a bit.  I do remembering rewinding Christians speech and understanding it but I felt like I was tricked or something.  Like why even bother having a crazy island adventure... give me the adventures of Ben and Hurley in postJacob land.  Then there was the questioning of the church simple stuff like really Sayid and Shannon?  I guess Nadia wasnt important after all.  I think in that feeling of it not going in a way that was instantly acceptable to me I failed to miss the beauty of what was happening and was picking apart things that really could be explained if given a little more thought.  After I watched    again on dvd I wound up loving the ending instantly.  Maybe since I could pay attention to everything and have the episodes so close together that helped me along.  I guess I was kind of like Ben the first time I saw the ending.  It just wasnt my time to go into the church. But by the end of my rewatch I found myself tearing up the same way I did when Sawyer and Juliet found each other.  ,lost,d4niyo3,5,t5_2qhag

His story was no doubt tragic but it was also beautiful. Locke was not just important because of time travel. One of the final moments of the show hammered the fact home once again that he was special. Without John the Island is doomed or remains stagnant. John was the most importance piece of the game. They were all pawns but some were more important than others. We thought Lockes purpose was going to be to lead. It ended up being greater than that. It was disappointing not having him involved with the action on the Island in Season  but his influence was all over it. It was pretty awesome to see Jack become Lockes apostle.

Everyone is into pushing the plot along as fast as possible without really taking the time to have characters that develop or express some sort of idea that is attached to them.Take Hannibal for example.   The show really just revolves around two people having this connection I know many who told me they gave up because nothing was happening and it was too slow.  The idea of looking into a characters personality and finding out what that means in a deeper sense didnt suit them.Hell it didnt suit many people back in .

10275145,0,t1_dc8h4d4,The carvings under the temple that Ben goes to in SE depict what appears to be the smoke monster in front of an Anubis figure and has a vent beneath for it to come out of long predating the brothers arrival. So the monster has been there for a long time before the death of MiB.However I dont think the monster just pretended to be Jacobs brother he was a real person until his death. Previous inhabitants may have found a way to contain the monster but the act of one brother killing another unleashed it again when so close to the font of evil the plug keeps in place. Various mythologies seem to hold fratricide as being one of the most evil acts indeed Osiris was killed by his brother Set and both are referenced often in the carvings around the island would also be a good excuse for while it was so pissed at Mr Eko for getting his brother killed besides the truth of why Adewale left the show. I dont see how Jacobs brother could of died from being in the pool because he fell unconscious  ft away from it so no reason why Desmond or Jack would of been in danger of becoming a new monster by stepping in it. While not physically manifest during the brothers time growing up it would appear the monsters influence still existed on the island because their adoptive mother was indeed crazy but was also the guardian of the island before Jacob. It may well have appeared ghost style to manipulate her like Jacob was able to appear to the candidates after his death while lacking a physical presence. Also the lack of any scenes of the monster doing monster stuff while the boys grew up suggests a dormant period.. surely a cloud of black smoke would raise more questions from the boys to their mother than a couple dudes building huts.When the monster does emerge from the pool again it seems to take on the strongest drives of those it pretends to be. it could just be coincidence that bother MiB and monster have a strong desire to escape the island but there are times when it appears as Locke when it genuinely seems to forget its not really Locke. Could it be the monster is rather than the manifestation of pure evil but a collective of dark and self destructive behaviour. There is no pure good or pure evil characters on the show lot of grey area. Infact in life Jacobs brother was one of the nicest people on the show until his mother nearly killed him and murdered all his friends. tldr Monster always existed Jacobs brother is not the monster. ,lost,dc8qrow,3,t5_2qhag

10918148,0,t3_5vz1uy,Yes and in general I liked it.  What goes missing in that approach is how tied the flashbacks are to the main action to the point of serving as a kind of key or Rosetta stone to whats happening.  But once you know the back stories once you know how they fit in with the main story its been enjoyable for me to watch without flashbacks or forwards and FSW.The only exception Id make is Everybody Hates Hugo.  I could be wrong but I dont think any other episode edits the FBs like that ep does where they seem almost happening at the same time.
