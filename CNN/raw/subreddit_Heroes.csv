4532291,0,t3_3d4sp2,uzeldapunkgrrl Said it all. The bonus content for the Volume II DVD explains that the season was planned as being as large as season . Generations Volume II was going to continue with Peter not catching the Shanti Virus and all the heroes racing to get Claire to stop the outbreak. The next planned Volume III was supposed to be Exodus which was designed to reflect the Shanti future Peter saw in Generations. This was cut and that lead to stark change in how Villains Volume IV was originally planned. Thus with the closing of Generations Villains was newly written as a new original story and not one that came about because of previous Volume occurrences like Generations and Fugitives.While as a true fan I dont believe the show died never to be revived with the Writers Strike but it made Villains amp Fugitives seems very wonky. Redemption Volume V was written and played out closer to Genesis and Generations thus leaving the series on a relatively good end or high point,Heroes,ct1xh8y,5,t5_2qpys

Im guessing her dad monetized on his ability to create EverNow and used the sword as a booster to get Mikos ability to work kinda paralleling Hiros quest for the sword and gaining better control over his powers due to it.Im guessing later in the series she will be able to freely travel between the real world and her dimension or possibly stay in EverNow since they already have graphics for it andor father connection without the sword and possibly pull people in with her for a safe getaway sort of use.,Heroes,cve2e8u,2,t5_2qpys

When noah and that ginger dude were looking for files i remember either a screen or a page saying that both claire and molly walker were basically MIA or that info on them was missing.

5658136,0,t3_3si1n1,I enjoyed this episode. Not quite as good as the last two but still good overall.I figured that Matt was in charge of that facility and I like his little hypocritical talk about being an evo cop who sells out his own kind. Hes a much better character now and Im glad to see that his arc has advanced.I still believe that we have a general bootstrap paradox after all nothing before Noah and Hiro went back could have happened unless it was because they went back TommryNathans ability and growing up in the past Malina growing up in the past with Angela Noahs memories etc. Im still relatively confident that nothing has actually changed although Phoebe killing or appearing to have killed Quentin a few episodes ago along with Renes earlier apparent death is an inconsistency and that it is possible that everything from Dark Matters after the explosion is an alternate what if type of future although it is certainly possible that Quentin was willingly being used to track down Micah. We dont necessarily need an explanation unless it is a pure bootstrap paradox though and can chalk it up to timeywimey stuff.Luke and Joannes showdown was interesting. Its too bad she shot Casper but its probably good for the story as a whole.Interesting to see that Miko has emergedor has just lived years in the future. It looks like Erica will use this future to manipulate Nathan somehow so I think it may be possible that the big final battle in Odessa may be between him and Malina.Im pretty excited for next week.

5724106,0,t3_3tepj6,Ive had a theory that Peter and Sylars ability are actually one I. The same  Empathic Mimicry. However the difference lies in their attitude. Sylar was traumatized as a very very young child. So much so that he never really connected with anyone emotionally. He subconsciously remembered how his biological father made him feel so he picked up that power from him. His DNA is flexible like Peters but not to the same degree hence the crazy.Arthur alludes to this when he tells Sylar that the head examination step is unnecessary. Soon after he learns electricity from Elle because he finally understood how she made him feel. Thats the most obvious bit of evidence to my theory. However there is one more...When Sylar lost all his powers but his original one which two stayed with him? Intuitive Aptitude and....Telekinesis. Why did Telekinesis stay around when the rest of his learned abilities were lost? Well it was the one Evo murder Sylar felt guilty of. It in fact left an emotional imprint on him that activated his true power.If and this is a big if Sylar ever returns to the series and has the ability to read minds then I will  confident that his power is the same as Peters original power and Intuitive Aptitude was picked up by his father. And to be fair powers being completely passed down to a child is usually rare it seems. It seems to be a variation of it like Arthurs Ability Theft and Peters Ability mimicry or completely different like Hiros father knowing the probability of anything as a weird form of precognition and his mother being a healer or Micah being able to control machinery when neither of his parents had any relation to that.,Heroes,cx6mr6t,1,t5_2qpys

But the one who is raising Nathan is the one who is already freed and travelled back with Noah.About Claire dying. There are  alternatives. Nathan took her powers. Or Phoebe was still blocking the powers on june th. So there is the possibility that Nathan can but dont have to take powers when he is near someone. According to this theory when he is near Luke and his wife in the earlier episodesI dont know which he didnt took the power neither when he was near Casper. But its true that they havent touched.

6518766,0,t1_cztjxo4,Season  Peter had all his powers but he was Haitiand. Honestly Peters arc was pretty interesting because he was rediscovering powers as he rediscovered his past.The oneatatime nerf came after Arthur took his powers in Season . He injected himself with the formula at the end of the first half of the season and thereafter could only have one at a time. Just typing this paragraph makes me cringe at how weird and terrible volume  got.Still though Peter was a liability. He was way too powerful. There was no way to keep him at his power level without causing tons of plotholes in the show especially as more powers were revealed. I actually really like your burnout idea but its a temporary fix unless it happens regularly. Eventually Peter will regain all his powers and be unstoppable again. The other idea is a permanent burnout but then Peter is a vanilla human and thats boring OR all of his powers are so weak as to be useless interesting but no fun.Now what I REALLY wish would have happened would be that Peters powers were ALWAYS limited to mimicking those in close proximity to him rather than learning to access all the powers he had ever been exposed to. This would make the ending of season  even more powerful Peter is able to fight Sylar but ONLY because all the specials had gathered. Fighting a villain alone? Peter only has the villains powers.
