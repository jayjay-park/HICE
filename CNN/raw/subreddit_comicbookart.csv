1251158,0,t1_ci9wekc,Excellent work if I could afford something original Id take you up on that offer.Im interested that you put him in Gotham in this piece. I like to see him out of his familiar element. Additionally the composition is unique but it works well its very dynamic as if weve just caught him landing from a long flight.I think youre right when you call him a beacon of hope and its a shame that many recent incarnations have lost that. Sure they give it lip service in Man of Steel and yet the example he sets in that film is less than ideal.To me Superman is at his core the guy who does the right thing no matter the consequences. Its his strength of character not his superstrength that I admire most.,comicbookart,ciadcn3,2,t5_2slqw
