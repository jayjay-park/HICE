2592681,0,t3_2pcqem,This is brilliant! Thanks so much for all the details. Would love to see some dialogs compared on fairly straightforward subjects e.g. getting a haircut the weather etc..Also how do Dari and Tajiki differ?Another quick question How much do written Tajiki and spoken Tajiki differ? I guess what Im asking is does the written language adhere to the standard grammar of Persian and the spoken language doesnt necessarily do this? For example in written Farsi we may say    but in spoken we may say .,Tajikistan,cmx0165,1,t5_2sayl

4245778,0,t1_cs477xk,Yeah I really see it but maybe on one or two occasions I saw someone in Dushanbe wearing it. In Uzbekistan I saw female laborers with their face covered a lot but I wasnt sure if the reason was other than religious.,Tajikistan,cs47jqu,2,t5_2sayl
4632054,0,t1_cteechw,gtI think vowel harmony is hard if you try to memorize it in writing but if you learn it just by ear then it feels more natural because the sounds go together. I think the whole point of vowel harmony is not that the language was originally written that way but it was simply the accent people spoken in because it made pronunciation more comfortable. In English we often alter the pronunciation of words to make it easier to say them.Theres something to that. I dont know how far Ill get with Turkish but I do look forward to seeing things like this. Ill always be all about Semitic culture and some IndoEuropean love too pgtI dont know Ottoman Turkish not very well anyway but from what Ive seen of Ottoman writings neither vowel harmony nor consonant harmony are present. To me thats more reasonable because Latinized Turkish unfairly penalizing learners for not specifying exact letters where the sound is inherently vague.From what I know most Turks couldnt speak Ottoman Turkish. I also read that often full sentences would have zero Turkish words and  Persian and Arabic. I understand why it wasnt compatible win Turkish nationalism. gtI suspect that Kyrgyz better represent the traditional nomadic lifestyle of the Asian steppe. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are in a geographic area where people have been sedentary for thousands of years so I think historically they were always urbanized. Central Asia wasnt always Turkic since prior to Turkic expansion it was an Iranian inhabited area but they were nonPersian Iranians until after Turks invaded and then subsequently Islam spread and brought Persian with it. It explains why theyre so mixed up. Iranians themselves were once nomadic at one point too and nomads still exist in Iran.I think this is the extent of my knowledge about the region. Actually I didnt even know all of it haha. I fully intend to learn more. gtUzbek is a pretty sound language when sung. I found it harder to speak because it lacks the kind of smooth flow that Turkish has. However Turkish always sounded weird to me.I know what you mean. I think its those umlaut vowels for me and the undotted I. It just sounds so...something. gtHere is one of my favorite Uzbek songs which I heard on my trip there this past Spring. You can hear a lot of the Persian words that they use in the song. I think Uzbek preserves the sound of Persian words better than Turkish does. Sometimes you cant realize right away with Turkish that word is the same in Persian or Arabic because they changed the pronunciation of it too much. In Uzbek Persian words sound like how they originally did in PersianThanks for the song! I like it a lot  and now I have a starting base to find more uzbek songs from D I must confess that I recognised exactly zero words from listening to that lol. My Arabic is far better than my Persian but my Persian is probably intermediate. Do you know where I can find the written lyrics? That might help lol. Kinda disappointed in myself now p,Tajikistan,ctefunc,2,t5_2sayl
