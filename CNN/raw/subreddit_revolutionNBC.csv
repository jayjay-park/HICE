495973,0,t1_cfwlzrp,I assumed much of it was Aarons imagination and the nanites were just controlling the plot.,revolutionNBC,cfwn9g8,4,t5_2u2kx
544844,0,t3_20apdu,I have to admit that I am a little disappointed that the Patriots are just an ultraconservative coup rather than the ultimate secret society. ,revolutionNBC,cg27eog,6,t5_2u2kx
706975,0,t3_2292f6,Season one Miles was the best. Season two Bass totally became the best character. I love all his wasted preblackout references on his son. ,revolutionNBC,cgkmx6s,6,t5_2u2kx

1053213,0,t1_cho04rk,No they cant just end it. There could be a line of books or the series could move somewhere else. Im not saying that either of those are probable but there really was no way to end it.,revolutionNBC,cho06wb,3,t5_2u2kx
1053835,0,t1_chnyq08,It felt a little too similar to a certain episode of Doctor Who.,revolutionNBC,cho2qjt,1,t5_2u2kx
1056387,0,t1_cho06ke,As BluELement postedI wouldnt say it was that bad of a cliffhanger. They wrapped up all of the current drama and then provided a completely new focus. Now if we were halfway through and they just ended it without resolving anything that would be a crappy cliffhanger.,revolutionNBC,chod6i2,13,t5_2u2kx

4300245,0,t1_cs9eb28,Its pretty stark and not exactly very satisfying. Wouldnt the nano dying have killed off their powersuppression ability? Even if all their stored energy died with them someone somewhere had to have tried spinning a magnet inside a coil to see if electricity could be generated.,revolutionNBC,csad1ea,5,t5_2u2kx
