1835965,0,t1_ckaezzy,Thank you for your reply. I guess Ive just had a stressful week. I should clarify that shes in a special day class for school its just her after school care that we are having problems with. The week ended well and I think my daughter is growing on them. Today when we picked her up the director had braided my daughters hair and commented on how my daughter actually sat still. Shes such a joy to be around and although she can be stubborn at times she has a bright smile and loves dancing and laughing. We live in the Bay Area and Im actually kind of surprised at how lacking the programs are here compared to where we used to live. Were connected with the local groups here so Ive been able to talk to other parents about different issues that come up. It sounds like your daughter is doing well which is very encouraging for me. Thank you for your advice ,SpecialNeedsChildren,ckafh9y,1,t5_2su71
