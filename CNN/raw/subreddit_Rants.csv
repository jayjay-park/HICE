1470426,0,t3_27tau4,I hate OkCupid too.  I tried it a while ago just because I thought it would be fun.  Heres what I found out the entire concept of OkCupid is just bunk.  Online dating in general is bunk.  Reallife dating is very tough too.  People dont fall in love with you for your great personality your emotional stability and your financial stability.  They just dont.  In terms of technology everyone copies the base model algorithm which hasnt changed at all in nearly  years ie its still heavily profile driven even OkCupid and its ilk.  There has to be a better way and someday it will be found.  We live in a day and age where technology has geometrically improved so many things.  I work as a computer programmer in the silicon valley and with all things related to my job the first thing me and my coworkers ask ourselves is What question do we ask google?  Every problem we enounter is something someone else has encountered before and has already posted the answer to someplace online.  We dont need to figure things out we just need to keep googling until we find the answer.  Then we need to figure out how the answer works and put it together in a logical way with all the other answers weve found via google.  I cannot imagine what doing my job must have been like before the internet made it a million times easier.  You dont really need to be a CS major in college anymore you just have to have a ton of intellectual curiosity and always be willing to learn.  Google can train you on the rest.  Someday soon someone is going to invent the google of dating.  Right now dating is like being a programmer before the internet.  My father was one in that era and I have no idea how he did his job for so long.  When someone invents the google of dating well all look around and wonder how people dated before this invention.  It will happen bank on it.,Rants,cj0ldgc,1,t5_2qhu7
2074259,0,t3_2ilnc5,I was once rear ended by a lady looking at her phone. She claims she didnt see me... of course you didnt you werent looking where you supposed to be looking. I was even stopped at a red light I assume she SAW it too. Clearly not.She had to pay for my repairs and my insurance didnt find me at fault. Oh and the worst of all she had a newborn in her back seat. A NEW BORN. DONT FUCKING LOOK AT YOUR PHONE AND DRIVE GOSH.,Rants,cl3hfbl,1,t5_2qhu7

8241447,0,t3_4p8673,I get what youre saying about the nd amendment and basically agree. What you said about the Mid East though is off base. America created the power vacuum there by ousting Saddam and Libyan government. Thus leading to ISIS. War in Mid East is directly correlated to British empire and America meddling for their own financial gain. ,Rants,d57qizz,1,t5_2qhu7

That made me the asshole. Brave had nothing to do with it. They wanted different bits. Cool.Im not against it. Just dont have enough fucks to give. Be whoever ya wanna be. Personally I just want to be the guy who doesnt care.,Rants,dbmtyk8,3,t5_2qhu7

10580019,0,t3_5rbjzz,Just wonder how often you said that throughout the previous  years of constant complaining. Because I keep hearing you lost get over it from people who right up until midnight on Jan   were swearing that Obummers coming for our guns hurr durr durr.A basic principle of democracy and a foundation of the Constitution is the right to dissent. Colonists were protesting before there was a USAthe Boston Tea Party was a protest.Either both sides need to stfu or neither does. If you dont agree with that either brush up on your American history or pack your bags and move to Russia.,Rants,dd78w93,4,t5_2qhu7
