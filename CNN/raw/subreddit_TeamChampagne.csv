5643993,0,t3_3seomy,You know.. breastfeeding is well known to help you lose weight after baby but I bet if you ask breastfeeding moms at least half will tell you the opposite. Breastfeeding has not made it easier to lose weight for me. At  weeks pp Im starting to exercise and eat less to lose weight but Im also paranoid about it affecting my milk supply. If my supply takes a hit I HAVE to eat more. My baby has to be able to eat. So thats frustrating...  pounds more to prepregnancy weight!,TeamChampagne,cwwox1o,7,t5_3ag1g
