2110440,0,t3_2iezmb,I dont know exactly what your circumstances are but my doctor told me that RAI for nodule is more of a cure than an excision when compared to RAI for Graves. The theory is the overactive nodule absorbs the iodine is destroyed and leaves the rest of the thyroid to function normally. Its really in Graves a more systematic overactive thyroid when your entire thyroid absorbs the iodine and gets destroyed. Perhaps you need a second opinion?,gravesdisease,cl82yl7,2,t5_2wrar

6388317,0,t1_czfr7ao,It takes a while adjusting your levels is not fast business.  When I was very sick the first time I was on probably mg a day and it took a while to calm it down.  Now I just monitor my resting heart rate.  When it goes above  I know Im starting to get sick.  I got get my levels checked and then mg a day does the trick and I tamp it back down.  It takes the longest for the TSH levels to recover for me and I hate going hypothyroid on methimazole so I really watch my resting heart rate and levels closely to keep from doing that.   years of practice now. Now Im lucky I do not have to deal with the eye component of the disease thank goodness for my genetics I suppose.  My dad and brother both deal with this too.  My brother is the only one of us with the eye problem in addition to the hyperthyroidism.  My dad had a thyroidectomy back in  and hes been on thyroid supplements ever since.  He strongly discouraged me from doing the radioactive iodine treatment.  He has been very unhappy with having to take supplements permanently which will happen with radioactive iodine as well based on my all my research reading at the time I was first diagnosed.  I know that once I retire I wont have to deal with the stress I do at work and this wont be a problem any more so Ive decided to hold onto my thyroid.  And the reality is its not a disease of the thyroid anyway its just following orders.  So I am reluctant to cure a symptom rather than the cause.But everyones case and what works for them is individual mine is very controllable I would guess thats not the case for everyone.  My recommendation is to learn as much as you can about the how the disease works and how your body responds to medication. Hope things improve for you soon.  I know how bad it can feel. ,gravesdisease,czfsa1h,1,t5_2wrar
11026160,0,t3_5xel7o,Welcome to the GD subreddit. I was just diagnosed about a year ago. I am on the lowest dosage of methimazole currently. I always used to get low blood sugar have weird energy levels where Id be hyper one minute then exhausted the next and had a resting heart rate of . Everyone is different with what treatment method they like. If you go for surgery or radioactive therapy immediately it does remove the slight chance of going into remission. Once youre treated though you will get a whole new lifestyle and feel sooooo much better. Good luck!,gravesdisease,dehsgs9,2,t5_2wrar
11797614,0,t3_68au2p,I cant prove that I had it as I was only diagnosed at the age of  but I recognise the symptoms going all the way back to around  or so.This is my video of my experiences with GD But in terms of life as a kid with GD? Its rough. It made social anxiety ten times worse threw my hormones out of whack ended up at a therapist myself at university.Like yourself I struggle terribly to remember very lengthy periods in my life. I believe that chronically raised stress hormones interferes with the process of laying down longterm memories in the brain. The isolation I have felt on and off but mostly on between  and my late twenties is something I believe that is rare in its severity and harshness. Its an insidious and nasty illness that eats away at your mental faculties and by proxy your ability to cope with and coexist with its sideeffects in your daily life. The coping mechanisms I developed were needless to say not of the healthy kind. Im just glad to be here and in as relatively good condition as I am.But yeah like yourself including social problems and anxiety I suffered badly academically as well im intelligent I graduated with a double honours in French and German but Graves made it a hundred times harder.I do feel adrift in a sea of days sometimes partially because of how GD affected my memories over the years one feels there should be a thread that runs through life and all too often it seems to be missing entirely.Its interesting that like yourself it seems to have been about a decade between the beginning of symptoms and a diagnosis. Suffering undiagnosed with a very complicated issue like GD is a punishing and unforgiving experience one which I wish I had been able to share with someone over the years as no one can appreciate it without having lived it. Certainly my powers of articulation arent up to the task at least.How did I cope with it in the end? I got treated and then I recovered using the guitar and the gym and entirely avoiding alcohol and bad food. My life is much better now but Im sure things wouldve been very different without GD.,gravesdisease,dgxat1j,1,t5_2wrar
