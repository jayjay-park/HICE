3650587,0,t1_cq8d1ml,I wanted a bike that can fit within standard baggage restrictions for ultrabudget bus services like megabus. Having one that does makes it possible for me to do short bike tours in a different state whenever I have a few free days without having to worry about ticket costs or the logistics of shipping a bike to the destination separately.Unfortunately the maximum baggage size is really small   inches combined length  width  height. Even small folding bikes dont normally fit this criteria since they tend to be very long in one dimension. I managed to make this one barely fit. I was initially going to change the rims to A but that ended up being too big. I had to go down to  inch which works fine but I have to do a lot of disassembly. Tires removed drive side crankset pulled etc. It takes about  minutes to build it up and adjust everything then maybe thirty minutes to take it back down which is reasonable for a multiday bike tour. The final minimum box size ended up being xx inches which is two inches under the limit. Some creative packing lets me get a basic touring kit in there since theres quite a lot of dead space. ,Frankenbike,cq8e6tq,7,t5_2xbq8

4285683,0,t1_cq0qyms,I love it. I think the mountain bike tire in the back slows it down a bit but it does make it a bit more steady. Plus its a NoMorflats tube so I dont worry about flats in the back.,Frankenbike,cs8ptqf,1,t5_2xbq8
