7444574,0,t1_d2ngzze,After today with Chiefs v Quins away and Wasps v Irish home in the last round I can see the top  being. Sarries         . Wasps          . Exeter          . Tigers rd is possible if Tigers beat Bath away and Exeter lose to Quins. Think Wasps might be the nicer option over Sarries.    ,leicester_tigers,d2oefmx,1,t5_3e592
