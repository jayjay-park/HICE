3614197,0,t1_cq41pze,There are only a couple reserved slots for the Mod to be able to mod and not kick off someone to get in. There are major latency issues and when someones connection becomes unstable I have no choice but to boot for the stability of the game and the other players on the server.,thewalkingreddits,cq48t86,1,t5_35w06
3614938,0,t3_31rdqm,Good to know there are reserved slots!  I was worried that my game was screwed up since I couldnt join last night until the server count dropped below .I did notice the zombies last night moving so much better! Pretty much no lag.,thewalkingreddits,cq4bumz,1,t5_35w06

Youd think after NEVER hitting any of their estimates that maybe theyd just add a month to any estimate and keep their internal goals the same. Use a Scotty estimate and be the miracle worker every time.,thewalkingreddits,d0l3ala,2,t5_35w06
7345709,0,t3_4fnbvd,Hey. This is ScubaSteve. In regards to the loot you can take whatever is in a prefabPOI nonplayer made building. I understand that with being a new player you arent that familiar with which buildings are prefabs and which are playermade so feel free to ask someone if youre not sure.Just make sure you follow the server rules regarding POIs dont destroy any loot containers in them if you take up residence in one it can only be temporary and you cannot lock doors or prevent other players from entering them to loot the POIs loot containers and you cant destroy the POIs themselves. Breaking down doors or windows or walls to get into a POI is fine but dont demolish them or any of their loot containers. Its recommended that if you place your own chest in the POI that you put it off the ground so other players can clearly identify them as playermade vs. part of the POI.And as for rules of where to build in Redditville yes you can build anywhere as long as you respect the server POI rules and the space of others ask before building next to other players bases. I think everyone is fine with building near each other but its common courtesy and they might have plans to expand their base or build a garden or pond or some other structure where you want to build so always ask first. You can build in town or on the outskirts like we did or away from the town. Whatever you choose.,thewalkingreddits,d2d5n85,3,t5_35w06
