5442516,0,t3_3plgm9,I think all are still widely played. Coming up with sports teams could be fun I think. Obviously these sports would be organized differently than in modern times but I would love to see SARs field teams and play on a national level.National Teams of the SouthwestAltaBaseball The Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego PadresAmerican Football The San Diego Traders Los Angeles EaglesHockey NoneBasketball Los Angeles BearsArizonaBaseball NoneAmerican Football Arizona RattlersHockey NoneBasketball Arizona HeatAztlanBaseball The Tucson Sidewinders and the El Paso Romans a play on Cesar Caesar ChavezAmerican Football Aztlan Strikers Hockey NoneBasketball Aztlan VaquerosNew MexicoBaseball Santa Fe JackrabbitsAmerican Football NoneHockey NoneBasketball NoneZionBaseball NoneAmerican Football NoneHockey Zion PioneersBasketball Zion Honeybees,socialistamerica,cw7c1ei,2,t5_39buk

5592947,0,t3_3rq8do,Possibly superfluous proposal for New Hampshire SAR. Its part of the New England SAR so it may not necessarily need one but heres an idea nonetheless. The general design is based off the flag of the New England SAR. The white black and grey canton is meant to be a graphical representation of granite.  This was chosen because granite has long represented the people of this SAR and their strong and hardy nature.  The fly has an anchor to represent the long history of the shipbuilding industry.  The anchor is flanked by the stars and garland of the prerevolutionary flag.,socialistamerica,cwqcvs4,2,t5_39buk
