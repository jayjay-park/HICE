5858276,0,t1_cxmeqy6,Yeah its a consistent reproducible thing on that machine. My win laptop has no problems as far as Im aware. How does the application make requests? I suppose its possible that some kind of network config change has broken it. I suppose it could also have corrupt somehow...? Where does RWC store data? AppData? ,rwallpaperchanger,cxnjrn4,1,t5_2zfys

11179843,0,t1_dez2epq,Thanks for the log and screen grab! Dang thats a lot of the same wallpaper! Ill have a trawl through tomorrow and see if I can work out whats going on! I dont think the hung bar is an issue. That simply shows the progress of pulling the thumbnails for each wallpaper when populating the blacklist panel. I wonder if one has been removed so it cant grab the thumb so hangs. Either way Ill get back to you.,rwallpaperchanger,dez80x5,2,t5_2zfys
