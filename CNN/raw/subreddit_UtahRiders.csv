4315491,0,t3_3acu1g,I havent ever had my tires changed at Moto Frugals but I bought some of my gear from them. I had a pretty good experience with their customer service and willingness to let me try out different things to see what I like. Sorry I cant give a real recommendation but I moved out of Utah county before I needed to change my tires.,UtahRiders,csc2zzf,1,t5_38pzm
