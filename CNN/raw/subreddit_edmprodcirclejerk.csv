7519260,0,t3_4iceqh,wow you are so deluded this is fucking terrible what about this makes you think it can contend with the thousands of excellent albums by producers that barely have a career or unknowns? Do you have any fucking shame? Putting out a album with this trash? You really think you can build a career out of this? The only good thing about this song is that there arent any notable mixing mistakes. Thats literally it. There is no interesting melody certainly nothing that is pushing the musical conversation forward in any way at all you are barely scratching the surface and this song has nothing to say except hey im a song on a album there is nothing else here. Please assess yourself fairly and dont make a full album thinking you are going to have a career with this level of skill its an insult. I am literally  times better then you and I am not good enough to establish a career yet and I certainly dont have the fucking balls to make a FULL LENGTH ALBUM. If this is in any way representative of your tracklist you should take a step back listen to your favorite artists and really understand how far you have to go. This is offensive to me.,edmprodcirclejerk,d2wwih7,14,t5_2tx7e
7538962,0,t3_4ilsi6,wow you are so deluded this is fucking terrible what about this makes you think it can contend with the thousands of excellent CSS Stylesheets by web developers that barely have a career or unknowns? Do you have any fucking shame? Putting out a stylesheet with this trash? You really think you can build a career out of this? The only good thing about this theme is that there arent any notable bugs. Thats literally it. There are no interesting colors certainly nothing that is pushing the design conversation forward in any way at all you are barely scratching the surface and this design has nothing to say except hey im a CSS stylesheet on a subreddit there is nothing else here. Please assess yourself fairly and dont make a full stylesheet thinking you are going to have a career with this level of skill its an insult. I am literally  times better then you and I am not good enough to establish a career yet and I certainly dont have the fucking balls to make a FULL SUBREDDIT DESIGN. If this is in any way representative of your work you should take a step back look at your favorite web designs and really understand how far you have to go.
