I would get deeper into Python unless you really want a more general purpose language. Then C and Javascript may be a better choice?,expertinayear,cygd5kc,1,t5_36uu5

Of course get the hang of it yourself in lessons first but there is no alternative to going and spending six months working in a McDonalds or whatever.,expertinayear,d2e7t1k,3,t5_36uu5

9592361,0,t3_5b20yu,mute allhelped me go from silver  to Plat  after placements within a couple of months  playing when i could. Im sure if i took the game seriously and mute all everygame i would be able to climb as well.. So i believe in you. Anytime you start to tilt just mute all and learn what is losing you the game What you could affect for the next one write it down so that it becomes part of the discipline that youre playing to learn.,expertinayear,d9vge8i,1,t5_36uu5
