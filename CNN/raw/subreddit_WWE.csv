44119,0,t3_1ujep8,I interpret Sister Abigail as someone from Bray Wyatts past that took him in probably a  creepy nun or something.  Its apparent from his NXT promo where he talks about his daddy who was burned alive in his boat causing him to go away. It adds to his mystique and mysterious past and origin of the Wyatt family. Bringing in anyone to be Sister Abigail would ruin anything decent left in the Wyatt family gimmick.  Theyre already watered down from where they started and the Daniel Bryan angle had potential but has already been a mess.  One of the Bella twins seriously?? Way to go creative youre well on your way to ruining the only interesting gimmick in the WWE  and the career of the most over superstar in years DBryan,WWE,cejgd1n,1,t5_2rau9

Brays a character so my thought is that its easier to draw the line between himself and his persona. Whereas someone like the Miz or Ziggler they are just playing certain aspects of themselves so keeping the kayfabe up is very murky and harder to do. Also with social media guy wanna showcase other parts of who they are to the fans parts that they cant show on TV because they dont get the time.

Shes a workhorse is one of the best on the microphone with no doubt and plays her character consistently. Shes not the best wrestler though and I think thats where a serious problem exists.

Hornswoggle is a heel with the jobber squad MB and currently in a feud with El Torotio.John Cena is still John Cena honestly not a damn thing has changed about him though hes currently in a phenomenal feud with Bray Wyatt who is an amazing heel.Rey Mysterio is still around though hes really past his prime as much as I dont want to admit it still one of my favorites though!Hardys are all gone. Jeff is on TNA and I have no idea where Matt is.Shawn Michaels comes back every now and again usually to serve as play piece in Triple Hs plan screwed Daniel Bryan last time he was there. Edge has to retire because of neck injuries. He didnt come back to wrestle but more inspire John Cena against Brock Lesnar hes back but a part timer which brings me to my last point...Undertake was still around.

Below them youve got a large crop of mid carders like Dolph Barrett and Kofi.  The mid card guys just arent getting over enough to break into the main event to stay.   The last person to really break through into the main event was Bray Wyatt and he is one of those guys whose only been there a year or two with that gimmick.  most people are watching NXT these days to see good rasslin.  ,WWE,ckb73rw,0,t5_2rau9

1953110,0,t3_2h1eca,Henry vs. Rusev The only thing I care less about than this match is the Divas one. Therell be a bit of a back and forth and then something stupid like Lana getting on the ring apron and distracting Mark Henrythe ref will lead to a Rusev victory to continue the feud. If he werent in a program with Bo Dallas Id love to see Swagger come out and go turncoat like Sgt. Slaughter did back in the day.Paige vs. AJ vs. Nicki Bella Thisll be a clusterfuck of a match carried by AJ and Paige. Which unfortunately Nicki is probably gonna win so she and Brie can fight for the title at Hell In A Cell in a godawful match. AJ and Paige are left to fight the rest of the current Divas roster and languish.Dolph Ziggler vs. The Miz Itll be entertaining like you said. Lots of back and forth just a little bit of comedy with Sandow and RTruth at ringside. Im thinking Ziggler picks up the win after some kind of interference from Sandow goes wrong. Eventually leads to a threeway dance at HIAC for the championship.Sheamus vs. Cesaro This will either be match of the night or just another terrible midcard fight thatll be forgotten in a couple weeks. I dont think the win for either one of them is as important as something like a double turn. Have Sheamus become the monster heel he should be and Cesaro back to the King of Swing. That said I think Sheamus is gonna hold onto the belt whether is by winning clean or by DQing himself.The Usos vs. Stardust amp Goldust I see the Rhodes brothers coming out on top here. The WWE has been teasing something with them ever since Cody became Stardust. Nevermind the fact that the Usos have held the straps for like  months now and havent done anything with them. They havent even been on a PPV since Battleground I know I know thats only  PPVs ago where they shouldve lost to the Wyatt Family while they were still on fire.Jericho vs. Orton Ortons gonna pick up a clean win here so Jericho can disappear to do his thing again. Itll be a decently worked match on both sides with Orton looking strong to reestablish himself as more of his Legend Killer persona as opposed to the lackey hes been playing lately. Id love to see a big spot Lionsault into the RKO maybe? to finish off the match but I wouldnt be surprised to see something like the punt to the head.Brock vs. CenaHow I Think Itll Probably Go Down Basically another decimation by Lesnar. Cena gets in some offence as he Hulks up and battle back but Lesnar continues to beat him down again and again. Suplexes Fs punches to the head. Finally locks in some submission that Cena cant even tap out of because hes out of it like Swagger and Rusev a few weeks back. Which he uses to say that he never actually quit against Lesnar. Hurrah for Cenas never give up attitude which irks Lesnar and Heyman. Cue match at HIAC.How I Hope It Doesnt Go Down A Cena win in ANY fashion. If theres outside interference from Heyman that leads to a Lesnar DQ. Or if Cena wins cleans and walks out of there with the belt. Any form of Cena winning and Ill have completely lost faith in the WWE. How I HOPE it Goes Down But Know It Probably Wont Because Why Turn The Universe On Its Head And Turn Cena Heel? Its a repeat of SummerSlam all over again. Lesnar is dominating. Just dominating. Hes tossing Cena around like a ragdoll. Commentary team arent even talking its that brutal. Lesnar throws Cena into the corner and runs at him for a Spear and Cena miraculously gets out of the way. Lesnar hits his head on the ringpost and is out but Cena cant make the pin. He manages to drag himself to his feet as Brock begins to stir. As he does Cena reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pair of brass knuckles which he slips on to a mixture of cheers and boos. He does debate slipping them off when all of a sudden Lesnar charges at him and he punches laying Brock out again. He acts all shocked like did I really just do that? as the ref rings the bell. Ref checks on Lesnar and Cena pushes him away and climbs on top and starts feeding Lesnar shots. Security is called and PPV ends with a bloody dazed Lesnar and a shocked Heyman watching as Cenas dragged away. You can even fit Rollins into the end there though I think itd be anticlimactic after what we just saw. He comes out knowing thisll be the only time he ever really have a chance to take out Lesnar. Hes right about to cash in when BOOM! hes blindsided by a returning Dean Ambrose because hey he said hed be there whenever Rollins tried to cash in. They battle their way through the crowd feud more for the next month and then fight for the MiTB contract at HIAC.,WWE,ckojxdr,6,t5_2rau9

2318774,0,t3_2luh97,The only reason nobody can compete with vince mcmahon is because of the perception that nobody can compete with vince mcmahon. The reason that perception exists is because every competitor to him previously was completely inept at running a wrestling promotion. Look at WCW. Prior to the N.W.O. they were at a point where they spent the past few months pitting good guys vs bad guys. It didnt even matter who the good guys were. They had the dungeon of doom teaming with the four horsemen. That combined group was conspiring to destroy hulkamania. In . Hogan was buddies with Randy Savage and Sting. Does this not sound like s WWF? The only reason WCW was beating WWF in the ratings barely at that time is because WWF was putting on some of their worst material in the history of monday night raw. Ever. Then along comes this major organization to compete with them and they made a few right choices to turn heads and get attention. Once they had that attention within a year they had one of the hottest angles EVER in pro wrestling history. They did it by using ideas that hadnt been done. They presented it in a manor that had never been done and even though hall nash and hogan were all considered to be wwf guys they used them in a way that played into that. Then they ran with it. That doesnt mean that preNWO WCW was in any way successful. Eric Bischoff has talked about how when he came into power the WCW live events were losing money instead of making money due to poor attendance. So even though more people watched them on tv weekly barely on mondays they still only had a few hundred people show up to buy tickets. Its because up until the NWO they used the same ideas that WWF had already flushed. They used the same wrestlers that WWF already flushed. You basically watched WWF and the new generation. With new wrestlers. Or you watched WCW and it was like a WWF rerun from  years prior. Then eric bischoff stole an idea from japan modified the idea to fit into WCW and gave american audiences something that was new and fresh to their TV sets. Suddenly there was a reason to tell your friends to watch WCW. Thats when it went from being barely better then WWFs ratings to WAAAAAAAY better then WWFs ratings. Thats when live events started turning a profit. Thats when WCW found its own identity. And thats what caused this preconceived notion that nobody can compete with WWE today. Everybody is using old recycled formulas that wont work again. TNA never found its identity. It went from seeming like a bunch of nobodys doing nothing to kurt angle jumping ship to now it seeming like youre watching WWE circa . Notice a trend? So does the rest of the world. The hardest part of competing with WWE is getting the mainstream to know you exist. TNA never got that. If you asked the average person what TNA Wrestling is they would assume its a bunch of girls with big boobs pillow fighting. Then assuming you tuned in which of all the other promotions out there TNA would have the biggest chance due to being on spikeTV the viewers tune out because its something they already have seen. Then theres ROH. They go back all the way to . I first heard of them in . It was a very niche group. Every event was only sold on dvd. So in order to follow the product you needed to be rich. They eventually discarded that structure and got HDNet. These shows had the production quality of a public access show in the s. Then they were bought by sinclaire media. The quality of the production went up but the available markets on tv are very limited. If you dont live in a sinclaire city you have to go out of your way to watch it on the internet. Which means you have to already be a fan and know it exists. The value of a major cable channel is that people can be former wrestling fans who dont like WWE and they are flipping channels or looking through the guide and see this new wrestling show is on. Once they watch they have to like what they see. Once they settle down and watch the rest of the show it has to leave them wanting to tune in next week. Once they tune in next week their interest has to grow from last week. Eventually they have to tell their friends and buy PPVs and tickets. Thats how a wrestling company grows. Thats how a company that has grown takes control. Thats how a company in control dominates. TLDR Theres a huge difference between it not being possible to compete with WWE and nobody currently doing it. ,WWE,clybcat,2,t5_2rau9

Now you stated that you are gagging for Survivor Series now. As you should be we all should. We deserve better! I understand business is business but it gets to a point. and i understand the PG era and the need to keep it clean for the sponsors and what it entails to please them. hell that may be the very reason why Cena hasnt turned heel yet. The sponsors might not want it they might feel it could hurt the influx of potential income. cause no matter what the storyline reads he is the face of the WWE. and at the end of the day it all comes down to revenue even at the sake of story development. its become clear through out the years that Vince is more than willing to alienate the fan base to appease the investors and stay true to his antiquated view of what a WWE Superstar should be. From time to time we as a collective voice can get someone exceptional pushed but they use them for as long as they deem them lucrative then they either delegitimize and job them or just out right release them. this is also the reason why they keep regurgitating the same played out storylines that had worked in the past. keep it safe and familiar. Wait the powers at be are on a power trip? you dont say! surely that hasnt happened roughly every year since the Montreal screw job.one can even argue that Lesnars title reign isnt because he deserves it but more to garner attention from the legitimate sports media. even at the expense of regular title matches at consecutive PPVs. and that is honestly one of the most disgusting things they could possibly do to the WWE universe. so to reiterate we deserve better!,WWE,cmaaf59,1,t5_2rau9

Ambrose Wyatt Ziggler and Bryan were all in that rumble tonight all absolute fan favourites each one of them was treated like shit they werent eliminated in any spectacular way that had the crowd on the edge of their seats hoping to god that theyd find some way to stay in the match. They were eliminated like jobbers. Knocked off the apron or just simply dropped over the top rope. Combine that with the fact that the last  were Kane Big Show and Ambrose that Randy Orton didnt make his return like everybody thought he would that they had Rusev pull the whole I wasnt actually eliminated thing just to be thrown over the top rope after a few seconds. Add to that that they had The Rock on hand because they knew that the people would boo the WWE knew that what they were about to deliver to their fan base wouldnt go over well with them that they had to have a legend on standby to walk down to the ring and try and save him. And again add to that how protected Reigns was they had him push Miz off the Apron to allow Mizdow to come in to the match they had Bryan eliminated early so people wouldnt cheer for him instead of Reigns towards the end they had Big Show and Kane eliminate  fan favourites so hed hopefully look good when he eliminated those two and they had him eliminate arguably the biggest heel in the company Rusev in about  seconds. Everybody thought that after last year the WWE had learnt its lesson and dont get me wrong Im not saying Bryan should have won tonight Im not saying anybody else should have won. I am perfectly happy with Reigns winning the Rumble if he does horribly on the road to WM and at WM then Ill be pissed at him winning what everybody is pissed at is the horrible decisions that were made throughout the match. It just simply became painfully obvious tonight that the WWE doesnt care about what the fans want and to be honest thats pretty fucking shit.Yes this night ended with people booing Reigns. But it wasnt directed at Reigns it was a fan base venting its frustration. And tonight the fan base collectively reached its limit in dealing with the shit that the WWE has been throwing at them. Its booing keeping guys like Ziggler and Bryan held back its booing keeping John Cena the same stale character that hes been for  years its booing everything that they did to Punk its booing a lot more things that I probably dont even realise. Unfortunately it just happened to be Roman Reigns standing in the middle of the ring when it happened.,WWE,co191yx,5,t5_2rau9

Granted I do believe he deserves a title re match since he never lost the title maybe that would be a good match at fast lane or possibly the ppv event after Wrestlemania. As far as the Wrestlemania main event this year that belongs to Roman Reigns. Now whether he wins the belt an goes on to have a successful run is hard to say theres been alot of good title runs from guys who werent known for saying much Goldberg was probably  of my favorites when i was younger he didnt say much but was booked to look powerful.,WWE,co1r7h7,1,t5_2rau9

Just cause you get it doesnt mean you get to keep it till you get your shot you might have Months to defend the title in before your chance at PPV comes up. The struggle for the midcard titles should always be ongoing similar to how it is now but with a better outcome. They mean something in the end rather then being a well he is holding the midcard title  that means hes going places except it doesnt.

IMO Sting being near the end of his career is probably best utilized to put the younger guys over but you cant have him lose clean all the time so while hell pick up a clean win or two at some point Sting wont beat Rollins for the WHC.

He wasnt necessarily the greatest wrestler but who cares he was the most believable guy they had to be a squash match specialist. His military press powerslam is like my favorite move ever and no one hits the spear like Goldberg.Currently Currently Id say my favorite is a toss up between Reigns and Cena. Reigns because I think he is extremely believable and he has to deal with more crying from the WWE Universe against him than anyone Ive ever seen. Cena because he is just an extremely good person and that means something to me I guess.Least Favorite Daniel Bryan. The perfect mixture of unbelievable and pampered. The guy is literally just handed belts. Had an entire WM dedicated to him and then gets hurt. So of course the smart thing to do is to have him win the next most prestigious belt almost immediately after his return just to get hurt again. Ive enjoyed the Bryanless WWE.,WWE,cvi7ww6,2,t5_2rau9

5700297,0,t3_3syc2t,I would book the intercontinental championship. After survivor series Roman Reigns turned heel and the Authority screwed Ambrose out of the title. So Ambrose is rightly pissed and goes ballistic on raw which gets him thrown off the show during the show a certain flying goat comes back to take the title away from the authority. On smackdown Ambrose is still angry and starts of smackdown but then Kevin Owens comes down and says Dean this is not the correct way to start of the Kevin Owens show so Dean responds oh well would you rather fake out of a fight you know i here the ratings on that show are droppin real fast then Owens proceeds to nearly get in the ring but then not but Ambrose responds by destroying Owens leg meaning Owens is out for a week or so. On the next raw Ambrose cuts a promo saying  You know Ive scratched and clawed to where i am today so when someone like Kevin Owens doesnt play fair and cheats and gets further in a year than i have in   maybe four im unsure of the number well im not gonna take that lying down. Im comin for the title etc. So on the next raw Owens comes out taped up and says  i wouldnt normally let a nobody like you go after my title but i need to get my hands on you for what you did to me i do this all for my family etc. So at TLC Ambrose goes after the title but loses via shenanigans. Unfortunately due to Rollins injury this is a shorter feud. So in the week leading up to the royal rumble both Ambrose and Owens say theyre entering the royal rumble. They cut a promo on a raw each talking about how theyre going to destroy the other in the rumble. In the rumble Ambrose enters around  and starts to eliminate everyone hes clearing house and looking really strong. Owens enters around  more the closing numbers. So Owens and Ambrose are battling it out completely destroying each other and by the time number  comes out its just Ambrose and Owens. Then you here woah oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh oh oh oh and Sami Zayn runs out and immediately starts attacking Owens which leads to Zayn eliminating Owens and Ambrose eliminating Zayn. This would lead to a ic championship match at Wrestlmania fuelled by Zayn destroying Owens shot at the wwe championship wrestlmainia and an Ambrose title shot.,WWE,cx3odw7,1,t5_2rau9
5703792,0,t1_cx37mmx,i like this idea so much though. And the back story is there. Reigns tired of getting stick from the fans and always seem come up short from the title with many obstacle rollins wyatt is fed up and looking for easy way up.Moreover with last week ambrose saying that they are brother forever and putting the trust so much for reign even fighting his battle and then getting turned will put much sympathy and emotional investment for his character. And they can also do storyline when rollins return as face because of how authority ditched him after found the man . in reign so rollins can get massive pop as well.But i doubt that happen since WWE has put a lot of onvestment to establish reign into the face of PG company with never give up attitude. ,WWE,cx440bw,2,t5_2rau9

He is currently in a program with the McMahons and the Royal Rumble will be for the belt. Dean Ambrose is the IC champ. He defeated Kevin Owens for it and they are currently feuding. Alberto Del Rio is the US Champ he returned to WWE a few months ago and defeated Cena in the US open challenge. Kalisto beat Del Rio for the belt a few weeks ago on Raw but quickly lost it back to Del Rio on Smackdown. They are currently feuding. The New Day are the tag team champions. Not much to say here. They were entertaining but WWE is kind of beating a dead horse now. Currently feuding with the Dudleyz. Charolette is the Divas champion she fighting the other divas. I dont really pay attention since Banks Lynch and Charolette got called up from NXT. The Undertaker and Lesnar had a few matches this summer. Undertaker returned at Battleground during the Lesnar vs Rollins title match. Pretty much he was tired of Lesnar and Heyman taking about the Streak. They had a Summer Slam match with a screwy finish. And then Lesnar kicked the shit out of him at HIAC. The Undertaker and Kane then feuded with The Wyatts at Survivor Series and havent been seen since. Lesnar recently returned and will be in the Rumble.

Have bray ditch the Wyatt family and become the new face of fear. The undertaker would then have been able to make appearances as a manager type figure like Paul bearer was to him. He could channel his power into bray and in a way continue his legacy. That way we get to see the undertaker frequently even if its just a video on the jumbotron and bray gets a boost in popularity.

Its not everyones cup of tea its more of a tv show featuring wresting matches but if you want to get a taste for the different styles of promotions I suggest checking it out along with NJPW. LU is also only on its second season so its easy to get into and a great place to get your foot through the door. I was desperately trying to get into wrestling two years ago but was overwhelmed by the long history of WWE. I was able to watch LU from the start learning wrestlers moves and terms more organically. It also helped that I was a fan of comicbooks and genre films which LU can feel like sometimes. From there I started watching Raw weekly and was making connections with LU that helped.

They address the show as family programming aka childrens TV on the show itself sometimes  Jericho amp Cena have done it specifically. Its literally rated PG. Spongebob is a childrens show and plenty of adults watch it and dont give AF.the guy has been out on suspension for  weeks only being mentioned by Rollins to keep him relevant for this triple threat and here you are bringing up irrelevant stuff about him like everyone else does but will go on to complain when hes featured throughout RAW. protip if the purpose of the post is to be all wahhh roman reigns dont talk about him cause the less the WWE sees about him the less theyll probably feature him. funny how it works. ,WWE,d567l65,1,t5_2rau9

8358081,0,t3_4u2gmm,A top title that can only be contended for by people holding lesser belts really disrupts a lot of potential storylines.  Going with your scenario you will see a match between the Raw and Smackdown champion for contendership to the Unified championship at just about every PPV.  Which means that any rivalries for those belts in their own brand have to be resolved before the PPV.  Since the point of television shows is to sell you on wanting to see a rivalry come to an end at the PPV ending the rivalry for each brands top belt on free TV every month undermines the whole point.  On top of that if a wrestler is both the Unified and Raw champion as an example then someone from the Raw roster would need to beat him for the lesser belt then beat someone from Smackdown to be allowed to challenge for the top title from someone that theyve already beaten.Finally this idea really undermines the whole idea of the brand split.  It would be best to keep Raw and Smackdown entirely separate.  If I were booking it they wouldnt even acknowledge that the other exists except for the very very rare occasions where they share PPVs basically just the big four and even then I wouldnt have them compete against each other with the exception of the Royal Rumble and a on Survivor Series match.  The point of the brand split is to give people the chance to grow into top stars and have a series of matches that cannot be had right away to create anticipation.  If every belt has a version that straddles both brands that undermines the whole idea.  Every time you put a belt on a performer it necessitates blowing through a series of matches with the other brand that in a competently booked scenario could have been dream matches that could headline a PPV rather than working the undercard as Raw Tertiary Champion and Smackdown Tertiary Champion.,WWE,d5mb8xi,1,t5_2rau9

The time it becomes an issue is when they are hooked on them and intake above prescribed levels. Steroids in general are really bad for you lol. Yes steroids can improve healing and are used in medicine. The difference is typically when its used in this way its to target somewhere where its lacking. Where as athletes pump themselves full of it additively to recover at superhuman levels and gain testosterone and energy.  If you dont think this is a problem I honestly question your intelligence and its becoming clear that theres no point in debating with you. If you show up to work on meth or even pot you get fired.  wellness policy would NOT prevented what happened to Benoit and his Family.

8590990,0,t3_4xh8uy,I think the choke slam is a move that should be protected. Too often SUPERKICK DDT STUNNER wrestlers incorporate important finishing moves to their regular set and if devalues them. With that said a choke slam is certainly one of those overused moves. The fact that he could put a spin on the move commonly used by Giants does make it special. So Im ok with it. However as history proves this will likely not be his finisher in a year or two from now. So I would say let him do it until he can come up with an additional finisher preferably a submission hold we havent seen a giant use. A big part of Strowmans repackaging is that he is unique. So if he can perform a finisher that protects him as a big guy but also makes him look skilled thats the way to do this. Shows a cerabral side.,WWE,d6fgpaq,3,t5_2rau9

No one should be crying bad booking in that scenario.  And AJ Styles as a Heel WWE Champ isnt a stale character hes genuinely entertaining.  What value do you get out of a Clean AJ win?  You bury Dean Ambrose out of contender status Cenas out Dolphs out Ortons out... so who do you have as a contender if AJ wins clean?No one.And that means your belt prestige is nonexistant.  A belts prestige when a heel has it is determined by who is chasing it.This is why you dont book like you suggest.  Does this mean AJs win is tainted?  Yep.  And that means that Dean has a legitimate call for a rematch for No Mercy. Your booking books for Sunday night.  The way they booked it books for weeks to come.  This is booking  theres reasons to do and not do things and usually when a heel wins the big title clean its followed by the burial of a face.

8996307,0,t3_53h0zw,That idea wouldve been good in the past but i think there could be other more realistic ways to do it. There are two ways in this feud to make Cena heel IMO that would be cool doubt hell turn heel though. Have him and Dean somehow take out AJ from the match permanently through announce table through barricade etc. as triple threat rules mean no DQ. Then have Cena resort to heel tactics to defeat Dean only to have Dean win causing Cena to go apeshit on Dean post match.. My personal favorite theory on how it should unravel have him beat both of them cleanly. The heat is already there because of this then have him close the following Smackdown giving an AA to Daniel Bryan during his celebration for tying the  world titles. On talking smack have him explain to Renee Young and Shane that hes tired of hearing the Cena Sucks chants and that he is overrated and that hes going to embrace it from now on because he is now the man to beat.He can put over guys like Shinsuke and other faces in the future and itd be a refreshing new look for Cena.,WWE,d7t7t7g,1,t5_2rau9

Like we havent seen a ppv in awhile where literally every match had a storyline that people were truly invested in.  We have heath and rhyno which people are eating heath up right now...what was supposed to be Becky and Alexa which people are eating Becky up as champ now....miz and Dolph might be the most built up storyline success of the past couple years....and Cena almost tying the record.  Plus the beautifully scripted Orton and and Wyatt angle....if they would have done IC at the midway of the show and heavyweight at the end or as the last  matches of the night or heavyweight first then IC....the crowd would have been lifeless it was a  hour event plus preshow kickoff.  The main goal of this ppv was to have the biggest pops during the IC and heavyweight matches and they did.  Plus they managed to get a pop out of every other match too.

But her botch last week was so bad if she fucks up like that again on a ppv I dont think shell be able to redeem herself in my eyes.

9973421,0,t3_5ibyjl,Money in the bank rolls around. We have watched as Nikki Bella wins the smackdown title from Alexa Bliss at Wrestlemania and Sasha retains hers against Charlotte and Bayley in a Triple Threat Match. Asuka debuts the night after Wrestlemania taking an open challenge from Bayley who just wants to fight after such a dissapointing result. Fast Forward to Money in the Bank where each brand agrees to enter  superstars and the winner will be given the choice of whichever title they want to fight for and therefore the opportunity to switch brands if they win the belt. Who benefits most from this? Imagine how refreshing it would be if Charlotte wins instantly takes the fight to Nikki Bella amp wins the belt  moving from Raw openning the heel slot to Sasha Banks and giving Naomi Bekki amp Nikki another really top heel to fight. Charlotte then can build Carmella up as a better heel let her trash talk and eventually they can have a blowoff match when each of them think they are bigger and better than the other. It also means that Asuka can fill the top card slot from Charlotte on Raw  Asuka the person to broke Bayley by taking her title in NXT  the same Bayley who hasnt had any success on Raw because Asuka holds this over her.Or  Charlotte Wins because PPV LOL!,WWE,db7kba7,3,t5_2rau9

If I remember it right during his matches with Rusev he already was a part of RollinsOwens feud and it shoudntve been like that. With Jericho... They just threw the title on the line. They werent feuding over the title it would be the exact same story without the belt on the line. And that takes relevance away from the US Championship. Relevance that first Cena then Rusev worked so hard to bring back. In my opinion Strowman if they keep booking him the way they do is the right person to save it.

Yes wwe is gearing up for another fantastic era as more and more stars get made. Yes currently SmackDown is better than Raw. Yes the Cruiserweight Division and Womens Divisions arent as good as they should be. All this means is there is room to improve. The head writer of SD is likely going to soon take over Raw or become the head of creative. When that happens the storylines will improve. Right now WWE is off script from their plan because of Balor getting injured and because they are stuck in the same people in the main event loop again but it is a show that doesnt take weeks off.

10312969,0,t1_dcc866u,yup.  Joe rogan theorized that Lesnar pissed clean long enough to know that the fight would go on and hed get paid.  He didnt care about the last  tests because USADA wouldnt catch him until after the fight was over and he was already paid.  Since it was going to be his last fight anyway he shot up a little extra before the fight.  Big deal he gets caught after the fight.  Hes already paid and hes not fighting again anyway so why not?  I guess Lesnar didnt figure it would hurt his reputation in the wwe since everybody in the company and the fans already knew he was juiced to the gills by looking at him.  That all may make Lesnar smart in a way cause he turned out to be right.   Still stupid to use anything when he didnt need  to.  ,WWE,dcd14ys,1,t5_2rau9

Without the success of the Attitude Era wrestling wouldve went belly up in pop culture completely. But then again its hard to take this writers opinion seriously since he thinks the attitude era started at with the Montreal Screwjob. The chemistry between all the elite talent WWE had Austin Bret Shawn Taker Mankind HHH Rock... this was the greatest roster in the history of wrestling! You even questioning that is a joke. Vince was always a genius. He played his hand at the right time. Was inspired by others and executed at the moments he needed to. He didnt need to go as extreme as ECW and didnt have to break kayfabe as hard as WCW. He made us beg for it. Gave small tastes of it and we ate it up. What you call stealing the world calls strategy. Vince is a true businessman a true creative genius.Do you want proof? Hes actually gone full circle back to his PG days building loyalty with the younger audience as he did with all of us and the product will remature again with and as his audience does. The attitude era will be back in a new form someday but right now he doesnt have to. The attitude era is by far... the greatest era in wrestling history.

10576024,0,t3_5reks0,Moving the PPV themes from show to show each year just leads to homogenization.  What they should do is aim for equality in the themes albeit at different times of the year.  Say that Raw puts on Money in the Bank in the autumn with the whole briefcase ambush cashin thing intact.  Smackdown would counter by reviving the King of the Ring with the winner receiving a WWE Title match at Summerslam.  This gives both brands an equivilent win this thing to earn a title shot PPV but makes the two brands distinct at the same time.One brand could run Hell in a Cell while the other revives the War Games.  Similar in concept but still different.  While your Extreme RulesTLC example works I would honestly get rid of TLC as a PPV entirely.  It just limits what can be done on that show because you start trying to shoehorn in things like a chairs match.  Instead I would prefer to see Raw take Extreme Rules while Smackdown picks up the old WCW theme of Uncensored.  The way that PPV originally worked is that the entire show was technically unauthorised.  Everyone was competing at their own risk.  Thematically similar to Extreme Rules but with the right storytelling leading into the show it could be the culmination of frustrations with AmDrag and Shane trying to look out for the health of the wrestlers while the wrestlers are so incensed with each other that theyll do anything to resolve their rivalries safety be damned.One of the things really holding the brand split back right now is that despite the separated rosters everything still feels too similar.  This isnt going to be solved during WrestleMania season since everything is building to that show now.  But if they want the split to work they need to spend the next eight months after WrestleMania making sure each brand finds its own style.,WWE,dd6u1fr,2,t5_2rau9

10646096,0,t3_5s9ak5,Lesnar Goldberg and Rock are outliers when it comes to part time workers. Lesnar was coming in with a high profile off of his MMA career and managed to negotiate himself a great deal and to his credit when he shows up he puts in his work and even a few years later it still feels special when his music hits.  Goldberg was supposed to be a one off and the response was so positive they came to an agreement to extend a contract out to Mania and he hasnt been beating anyone other than Lesnar.  Rock has turned into a pop cultural icon at this point. You cant have someone that will bring in millions of outside eyes job out to lesser known guys.  I also think there is a major difference in opinion between newer and older fans when it comes to part timers. I have been watching for almost  years and grew up on the world champion showing up rarely and having the midcard guys carry the show. The issue to me is not guys working part time schedules its the lack of a legitimate midcard that has hurt the product. No one is in a defined tier when it comes to championship anymore. Everyone is capable of jumping from midcard to main event without hesitation or struggle and that creates a lot of grey area and everyone melds together into one giant grey blob. ,WWE,dde2a53,0,t5_2rau9

But compared to Lebron James . of the NBA isnt on his level. I feel Charlotte is this. Shes just biggerquickerfasterstrongertechnical than everyone else. Its hard to believe shed lose to any of these women. As good as Sasha Bayley Becky and such are. Charlotte is just better. She really fails from not having anyone like her to face.

11253299,0,t1_df72qrj,Punk was good in the ring great on the mic. I caught the beginning of his career but didnt watch much of last  years. It was actually his UFC fight that got me back interested in wrestling and watching again. Having watched much of his old stuff on youtube and wwenetwork he was a very bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming era. So was he all of those things you said? Probably. He also comes across like a guy who really thought he was competing in a real sport and deserved whatever top spot existed in his mind and would accept nothing less. On the other hand he was also an incredible talent who was right about many of the criticisms he leveled against the company and was most likely the victim of extreme mishandling.So as much as people including myself would love to see him back its also a call the people in charge literally Triple H and Steph that the fans dont like what theyre watching its boring they want it more exciting and they liked all the things that punk guy had to say. At the end of the day he felt like something real in a fake world and it was refreshing. ,WWE,df7jm9p,1,t5_2rau9

But wwe just has dropped the ball. But the whole wwe universe booing Roman not because they dont like him but because they want to push back the company is hard to swallow. Because whenever Vince comes out like he did last week I believe he was cheered! I dont know.. I do appreciate your comment so much! Well typed good examples and so on. And I do agree with that promo and the whole Daniel Bryan one.Which I must say Bryan is one of the best modern wrestlers out there. Too bad he cant come back to where he belongs despite getting cleared from all his doctors.I just wish wwe will allow him to turn heal.. imagen Roman dropping somewhat of that infamous cm punk pipebomb. He has so much to work with. For example he can say something like you all boo me but your in the airport at  in the morning for an autograph just to go sell it on eBay because your to lazy to get a real job!Ok ok he cant say those exact words because those are punks but you get my drift.

11762597,0,t1_dgsq85j,You can laugh all that you want though its sad that someone much closer in age to the neanderthals than I has issues with logic.Of course Hogan transcended wrestling didn i just tell you entertainment was much more limited and as such wrestling was bigger? Fans would talk to their friends and bring them into the fray. Today if you watch wrestling you get mocked. Cena became even bigger due to memes it wasnt just his natural charisma almost anyone with technology in his house has seen or heard about Cena.Of course fans would reject the next Hogan wanna be. Even Cena who is a great promo to back him up had problems with the fans that hated how he was the second hogan.And you can blabber for days about smarks and reigns the fact is in  he was the most over in the shield and people booed when he lost the RR. Had he won then hes be on his way to Cena level. The fans turned on him for reasons unrelated to his quality. Hes improved a lot yet the people that cheered him back then now say he sucks.In the end it doesnt matter hes a money maker and he can get any other wrestler massive cheers. Strowman will never get louder reactions than with Reigns. ,WWE,dgtbipv,2,t5_2rau9
