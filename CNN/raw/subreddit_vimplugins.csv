I can totally see where you might have been a little defensive and perhaps a little sensitive and willing to go a little offensive.  I might even be willing to admit that your point that it wouldnt be a technical issue per se...though it would technically be an issue.  But seriously if English isnt your first language or you typed that on a phone or something Id say its probably not insurmountable.,vimplugins,d9outzh,1,t5_2rf3x
