1482899,0,t1_cj23j2s,I didnt mean learn to shoot right handed I mean use a right handed gun shooting left handed. After I got used to the safety the shells ejecting across my face never really bothered me. ,LeftyGuns,cj25nk5,3,t5_2tgm6
1487263,0,t1_cj236db,gt your best course is to learn to shoot a right handed gunWhy do you say that? I mean I am a lefty shooting a bunch of righty guns and Im actively looking to get lefty guns SPECIFICALLY because Im tired of having to adapt. The guns exist and theyre not hard to find. Why is there this big taboo against using them?,LeftyGuns,cj2pbw7,2,t5_2tgm6
