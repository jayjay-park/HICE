6094379,0,t3_3yll62,gt Play with electronic toys is associated with decreased quantity and quality of language input compared with play with books or traditional toys.This study did NOT show that there was decreased language learning among infants as the title of the article claims but instead showed that parents use less language around children when playing with electronic toys than with books and traditional toys. Its tempting to jump to the conclusion that because less teaching went on less learning occured and while this conclusion is certainly possible it is not what this study showed.,ScienceFacts,cyid9fq,2,t5_38by0
6639237,0,t3_46hx6u,While this is pretty fascinating the Milgram experiment also shows the limitations of peoples willingness to follow orders. The experiment often cited where  of participants complied is referred to as the baseline experiment it is the only version of the Milgram experiments that produced those results. Alter any aspect of the baseline experiment put the learner in the same room have multiple teachers instead of a scientist in a lab coat use any one else including a scientist not in a lab coat and the compliance rate drops dramatically.Even more damning is the prods used  of the five scripted prods the subjects were given only the fifth was a direct order quote you have no choice you must continue. Compliance rate after this prompt was given drops to .The Milgram experiments actually show us two very important things We will follow instructions given to us by a trusted authority so long as the intentions align with our own beliefs. We will not follow orders if pressured to directly.,ScienceFacts,d061yzd,3,t5_38by0

7780717,0,t1_d3pxzzy,Thats a really good explanation! I hadnt thought about it before but it makes perfect sense the difference between FM and CW that you give up the ability to transmit a lot in exchange for more people being able to use it. Oh and I dont mind grumpy old boys club types but Im a  yr old woman so they might mind me.  Honestly though I spent a lot of my formative years as my Grandpas shadow. He was a grumpy old engineer and all his friends were grumpy old guys and I loved them. We all got along splendidly and they always seemed excited to show me how to do anything I asked about. I found myself at  yrs old sitting in rocking chairs in front of the auction house where a lot of them hung out on a Thursday night. They all would whittle cedar sticks and make these tiny shavings. I had my own pocket knife and would make these giant hacking attempts. But they eventually taught me. I think most people love to share things they are interested in.So heres another stupid question if you are running yours through your computer do you still use an antenna?  ,ScienceFacts,d3qlps1,1,t5_38by0
