387458,0,t3_1yixih,I have been cooking Indian food pretty much my whole adult life  more than twenty years now. My family has cooked Indian food for generations as my father is Indian. They and I have always cooked in large batches and frozen leftovers.Ive frozen dhals meat curries poultry curries fish curries vegetable curries biryanis pulaos aloos and breads. All have frozen perfectly. Im not sure whether eggcontaining curries would freeze and reheat well. I have found that the curries tend to reheat better after having been thawed conventionally before going in an oven for twenty minutes or so. Having said that careful reheating from frozen in a microwave by which I mean heat on medium power for  minute stir repeat until piping hot throughout will work too.Good luck!!,IndianFood,cfkxc2l,12,t5_2s65y

I think in your case its more important that you look after your personal well being and also make things easy for yourself in the kitchen so its probably better to use ground spices for all the food your prepare. What I would suggest is that if you are able to digest ground spices without any issues that you buy them whole and grind them yourself at home so you get the best of both worlds. ,IndianFood,cpyvyw9,2,t5_2s65y

7440239,0,t1_d2nfw1i,As uTransFatty mentioned there actually is a difference. I once had sambhar and kootu at someones house and was trying to figure out how they had prepared the food in order to bring out such bright flavours. Turns out they ground their own spices. I dont think they ground it fresh every time but they probably made smaller fresher batches than what you can get at the store.      To be honest I havent ever tried making sambhar myself. I feel like you can get away with decent sambhar using the store bought powder but you wont be able to attain that next level freshness and brightness that grinding your own mixture affords.    Id probably first get used to making sambhar via the store bought mix then transition into making my own sambhar powder mixture as I get more comfortable.  ,IndianFood,d2nwocx,2,t5_2s65y

Add a can of coconut milk and a tablespoon of green curry paste and mix it evenly. Once you feel like the sauce has had a chance to soak into the brussel sprouts add Braggs to taste and serve.My dad has hated brussel sprouts his entire life and he loves this recipe. ,IndianFood,d5ovjci,2,t5_2s65y
8435874,0,t3_4v5v8b,I guess everyone has strong opinions about chai. Heres mine. I feel that the typical way of making chai is actually quite bad as it involves boiling the heck out of the tea leaves which makes it bitter.A much better way to make chai is to take watermilk  if whole milk  if skim milk add crushed cardomom ginger and whatever else and let it come to a boil. When it comes to a boil it will start rapidly rising so watch out for it and when it does start rising remove from heat.Having removed it from heat add tea leaves. Vagh Bakri is good for strength but if you want a balance of strength caffeine and aromaflavor then do halfhalf CTC tea and tea leaves. Black Label and Green Label for example or Vagh Bakri and Green Label or an Oolong. You can also find premixed CTC and tea leaves.You actually do not need to bring the pot back to heat now as the watermilk is already hot enough to brew the tea. I guess you could bring it back to the heat for another rapid boil but really dont do it for too long  half a minute or so at most  resist the urge to boil the heck out of the tea to extract the last bit of stuff from it. Stir the tea leaves in with a spoon cover with a lid and let the tea leaves brew in the hot liquid for at least  minutes. This is what brings the true aroma and flavors out.Add sugar filter and serve.,IndianFood,d5w0va5,4,t5_2s65y

9529404,0,t3_5bcfqo,Heres a slightly involved idea echoing other posts mentioning Southernfried okra fried pickled okra. Most people dont like okra because of the slime and both pickling and deep frying cut the slime factor down to an almost imperceptible level. Boil equal parts water and vinegar with salt to taste and whole spices of your choice coriander cumin black pepper and mustard seeds might be nice pour the mixture over okra and plenty of chilies and refrigerate indefinitely. Once theyre pickled to your liking you could fry them in a batter of chick pea flour corn starch water salt turmeric and maybe a little baking powder for lightness. Maybe serve with a sweet chutney to complement the sourness of the okra. And of course whatever pickled okra is left over would be great for use in stews fried rice or as a side dish on their own.,IndianFood,d9np7jw,4,t5_2s65y

9982691,0,t3_5gxj99,It sounds like chili powder but be aware that chili powder can mean many different things Chili Powder in an Indian grocery refers to powdered dry red chilis. This is a seasoning used to provide capsaicin heat to a dish. It usually comes in two varieties  regular and extra hot. Unless you are used to Indian food you will find both to be quite hot. Use sparingly. Chili Powder in an American grocery is a spice mix used for making chili a meatbean stew. This is not a single spice its a mixture of many spices in different proportions. It has absolutely nothing to do with Indian food. But you need to be aware it exists because if you go to grocery store in the US and pick up a jar of chili powder in the spice aisle this is what you will get. Kashmiri Chili Powder is a specific type of Indian chili powder which has a very mild taste. Most Indians wouldnt even call it hot though if you are used to bland foods you will detect some heat in it. It does have a rich earthy flavor which goes great with some dishes and provides a deep red color to the gravy. Paprika is also a kind of chili powder since its made of bell peppers which belong to the chili family. They have next to no heat and are used for color and flavor alone in European cooking specially around Hungary and the Balkans.Since youre asking in rIndianfood Im assuming you have an Indian context for your question in which case chances are high that the red powder is just dry red chili powder used for heat.,IndianFood,db8ru0d,1,t5_2s65y

Boil till tea is a golden orange. Taste. Add additional spices as needed. Some people like a hint of clove or black pepper. I dont.
