11557325,0,t1_dg5t4vb,There are a coupple of books online by calan if you want to understand democractic confederalism there is a short book by him with the same name. For Bookchin I would say The Next Revolution would be a good starter there is even an audiobook of that on this sub. I also really like Damian F. Whites book Bookchin A critical appraisal.,Communalists,dg60z5l,2,t5_36o7o
