4830950,0,t3_3god75,I agree with what people have been saying thus far given the size of the sub monthly might be the best bet. I think this is a really great idea though so as the sub picks up speed we could increase then rate. Also I think a week would be a good amount of time in advanced for people to start thinking up questions to ask.Other people I think would be cool to hear from would be Teqtoniq aBstracT Kepz SOLACE and Bluedude ,Audiotool,cu3hbwv,2,t5_2sict
