6125923,0,t1_cylwkfo,Thanks for the link to the other post about the data center contractor interview.  Ill be interviewing for a position titled Data Center Technician level  which I believe will be junior to the position the other poster was going for.  Still Ill be scouring that post till tomorrow just in case.As for question  I dont think Im under any sort of NDA.  Ill be interviewing for a position in one of EMCs data centers in the Research Triangle.  Unfortunately I dont know anything more specific than that.Thanks again for the info.  It really helps me narrow down my research focus.Edited to provide more accurate info about the position Im interviewing for.,datacenter,cylyca2,2,t5_2rkdh

Remember everyone is responsible for their own security unless they agree to provide client security and IDSIPS services.    But say a clients server is breached then they are themselves resposible for security. ,datacenter,d6e1nex,1,t5_2rkdh
