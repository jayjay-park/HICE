Looking back it was terrible writing.  New story published start of Feb  so far ive had  sales.  And my rank has gone from  in erotica to  as of today. Does that rank of  mean its more visible and will pick up more sales or does it mean nothing?nd Question  How much do reviews affect visibility or sales of a book?,eroticauthors,cfbymoi,2,t5_2y69p

965801,0,t1_chdzsej,Hi TabathaAustin. The most common scenarios are the cliches we can immediately think of  the ones you mention and others like cowboys office workers in the john saunas pools lakes locker rooms gym anywhere men shed their clothes and see other men naked. Its what you do with the locales and characters that elevates them from the cliched. I think the stories Im glad to see gone are the ones about a gay man who lusts after a straight man because that straight man is a real man. Too much selfhate. The leather scene SampM scene cruisingcasual sex scene  all of these were once gaycentric but have gone more or less mainstream. Timeless stories are ones that have an emotion punch with their readers. I think BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is full of cliches but its how this particular story about cowboys is told that gets people to respond to it. Tragedy helps. I remember reading an erotic story in the s that won a big cash prize from a gay porn magazine  it was about a guy who thought of himself as a dork with glasses. He couldnt believe his luck one night in a strawberry patch when the hot guy in the neighborhood did a solo scene just for him. He thought it a fluke and ran from hottie every time hottie made a move on him. It wasnt until years later that the dork realized hottie was really hot for him all along when he unexpectedly saw hottie at a gay bar with his boyfriend who had a very strong resemblance to the narrator. Its a lovely hot sad story. An important component to a porn story or to any fictional tale is the evolution of the main character from when we first meet himher to the end of the story. She is a changed person and sees things differently. Its that transformation readers respond to.,eroticauthors,che2k2z,3,t5_2y69p

1522288,0,t3_2bnmp7,I have a Manual of Style which has all my wisdom about this Ill reproduce the relevant parts here. These are just my opinion some of it especially the stylistic stuff is not necessarily standard.  Always in the past tense and either third or first person. No omniscient POV stick with one character unless youre writing something at least novellalength about k words. To cum is a verb. Dont spell it to come. Use cum he is cumming he cums he came he will cum he will have cum he has cum he had came When using it on its own you can describe a scrotum as a sac no k. In a compound word like ballsack the k is preferred. Precum should be one word no hyphen. Use of the verb to grind is common in sex scenes. But the past tense is ground and the noun ground i.e. whats beneath your feet is also commonly used in sex scenes. Both are okay just be careful I often change this in editing and its easy not to notice it. remember people are masturbating not reading closely. Penises should be referred to as dick and cock mainly. Alternate between them. Penis rod member and manhood are okay sparingly. Tip shaft base root foreskin and head are okay. Maybe glans sometimes but I usually remove it. Testicle ball sac and scrotum are all fine. Use pussy freely if your audience is men. Use it sparingly for women in most stories use it more freely in kinky or BDSMtype stories. Cunt snatch and twat should be used sparingly for an audience of men and only in extreme works for women. Same for minge quim and fanny in settings where they are common Clitoris clit mound and vulva are fine if used sparingly. Im ambivalent about labia. Other words for female sex organs including  vagina sex and entrance should be used sparingly or not at all. Yes that means you have to dance around it a lot. Breasts and tits should be used freely. Orbs and similar shapebased words are okay in certain contexts. Avoid boobs or melons or anything else outside of dialogue. Wherever possible use nonflesh words to signify sex organs. For example he caressed the bulge in Jims pants uses the nonflesh word bulge to mean male sex organs. This doesnt mean to use unusual metaphors like he caressed the banana in Jims pants but to use words specific to an individual situation or environment. English majors use metonymy more than  metaphor Unless your setting is an unusual time or place dont use other words for sexual organs.Now for the more complex issues theres too much to reproduce it all here. So seriously go read my manual of style People are choosing to read erotica over watch porn so give them the stuff they cant get from porn. Smells tastes big scenes costumes set and setting context. If youre writing billionairethemed erotica it should be a story that could only happen to a billionaire. Dont just write an erotic story that happens to be about a billionaire. If your audience is men that billionaire needs to be the sexiest billionaire ever and should exhibit all the traits that make billionaires sexy. If your audience is women focus on the change of relationships over time. Not necessarily boyfriendgirlfriend relationships but changing power dynamics etc All sex scenes should have a defined setting. Remind the reader where its taking place. During sex every paragraph or so should have a reminder either of the setting or the theme or ideally both e.g. remind the reader hes a billionaire and theyre in his office. Use metaphors and other literary language to evoke ideas like rugged masculinity or powerful orgasm Pay close attention to rhythm and sentence structure. Keep it simple and easy to follow especially in sex scenes. Avoid group sex. Dont focus on anatomy during sex focus on the feelings effects setting and themes All sex acts should have five stages early arousal penetration or equivalent preclimax orgasm afterglow. Dont skip them usually. Each sex act in a story should get progressively more in some way could be more kinky more loving more passionate more intense etc.I also have a bunch of links at my manual of style I dont feel like changing them all to reddit formatting. So go here if you want to check things like hairstyles clothing terms etc. Those kinds of words can really evoke a person andor subculture so you want to get it right.,eroticauthors,cj73gv3,5,t5_2y69p

1760330,0,t3_2emqjh,Choosing a pen name is entirely open... although Id add a few general guidelines.. Dont choose a pun name unless youre writing very cheesy stories.  Claire Westwood is better for a general catalog than Claire Cocksalot.. Female names tend to sell a little better than male names  except for gay erotica.  . If you pick a name do at the minimum a Kindle search to make sure there arent any other authors using it.  That will be awkward for you both.. If you pick a name somewhat similar to yours it raises the chances that other people in your life might find it  but it also makes it easier to convince them that you write erotica if you tell them.. Make it pronounceable and easy to spell or remember!  Claire Spheinechartandero is not going to sell well.  Good luck searching for that on Kindle.. If you look at popular covers an interesting trend pops up  its surprisingly common to see author names with a twosyllable first name and a shorter onesyllable last name.  Lawrence Block.  Gillian Flynn.  Alton Brown.  Bobby Flay.  And I believe that these names look especially good on a book because when stretched to be the same length this makes the last name bigger than the first.  Example.You dont have to follow any of these naming suggestions but they do help!,eroticauthors,ck11owz,4,t5_2y69p

2031191,0,t3_2i0c64,As a general rule erotica is almost ALWAYS more appealing when told from a womans point of view for both male and female readers. For women because it gives them someone to identify with and for men because what man doesnt enjoy a story about a woman who loves sex?     I would think this would be even doubly so in the case of incestuous situations. Most mainstream outlets almost always portray incest negatively as the man forcing it on a woman. Portraying it from a perspective where the woman wants it at least as much as the man does diffuses a lot of the ick factor that seems to be inherently present in that sort of scenario.,eroticauthors,cky0c0k,2,t5_2y69p

2274881,0,t1_clsv0ma,Its a parody of a roleplay game in Second Life called GE Gor which means Gor Evolved. Over  percent of the players in the game are female. So I figure that there is a market for it among them at least. But I use Second Life avatars as models for all my covers because its easy and fun and to my mind creates interesting covers. Im thinking seriously of changing that.Now the story itself is not really marketed at men OR women kind of both. Both characters and how they feel and who they are are important. I realize this puts me outside the box for both romance and erotic fiction but damn that was a fun story to write and I think a fun story to read and I hope that I can somehow make that evident to readers somehow.,eroticauthors,clsw7db,1,t5_2y69p

2295564,0,t3_2ljmb6,Its not that hard to max out keywords. I just type in a relevant word in the search box screenshot the suggestions filter out duplicates put it on one line and add a comma. I keep all these in a file. Then when its time to publish I mix and match these. I take these phrases and reorder them based on priority then combine them into one line and paste it into the box. I usually overflow the box. I consider a sale to be two phases  to be exact. The first is getting discovered. This phase depends on your keywords title and cover. As a whole theyre probably about the same weight but if I could only keep one it would definitely be keywords simply because it influences what comes up when people search. The second is getting the sale. At the very least you want them to read at least  to get your KU. However I think getting them to finish your book is even better. If Amazon tracks how much readers read your book I imagine they also give you more search juice when readers actually finish your book. This also has the added benefit of readers actually browsing your back matter. When they get to the last page kindle will prompt you to rate the book as well. Writing well is very important but it alone isnt enough to get your foot in the door. Thats why keywords are important. If keywords dont work for you then Id suspect its either the title or cover. To recap the purchase process . Type into search. . Scroll and click the interesting one. . Read blurb or excerpt . Buy or read past ? The amount of information visible at each step is different. Getting more than  reviews on a title would probably be even better because those stars are visible everywhere at every step.  ,eroticauthors,clvg4o2,1,t5_2y69p

Since hearing that I went out of my way to make it overt that its consensual. The one that was blocked was a valentines daythemed romanticish one about someone using hypnosis to get two people that had a crush on each other but were too shy to talk to each other to hook up. The cover had flowerscandy and a close up of a girl holding a lollipop to her lips. Tame as hell throughout and was supposed to be the second part of a series of holidaythemed stories. Kind of frustrating.I didnt get an email the day it was blocked so I sent a message to their support to see what the canned response would be. Support responded the next morning and basically said to resubmit the book as a new book please let us ban you! without even mentioning reasons for the block.

That way you have a better shot of doing well for small niche keywords but yet if your story eventually takes off youll still have the chance for major exposure under a larger keyword.That being said I personally like to target keywords in the low to mid hundreds with the ceiling being  results or so for the largest keyword.  But this is just whats worked for me.,eroticauthors,cp0yrjq,3,t5_2y69p

3359217,0,t1_cpa23cd,I looked up these titles without logging in so I would think that Amazon would not show me Adult dungeoned books I did not get the Excluding adult content warning however. Of those  titles I looked through the covers of the first  results based on publication date today back through Dec.  .  Of those    were books which would seem  based on what we can figure out of Amazons hazy guidelines  to be the sort of cover that Amazon might reject a person showed as clearly bound or with apparentlylocked handcuffs. Of those   showed up in the Kindle Store gt Kindle eBooks gt Literature amp Fiction gt Erotica gt BDSM category and  attempted to slip around the erotica category by coyly being classified as  Romance gt Contemporary Biographies amp Memoirs or Humor amp Satire gt Satire.  was Erotica gt Lesbian. Most of these titles appear instead to have used handcuffs as a keyword to attract the BDSM demographic  although probably an equal amount  showed unlocked handcuffs the handcuffed pair of heels stock photo or handcuffs merely on the belt of a policeman not being used.    I would still be very careful about using handcuffs on a cover although your chances of sneaking it through appear to be best if you are in the Erotic gt BDSM category.,eroticauthors,cpb6c29,1,t5_2y69p

Truth be told a lot of people skip around until they get to the sexkink they want ahem use it a few times and then move on to the next story.Its really frustrating to me because I like the build up I put work into it to really set the set the scene for why it makes it even naughtier for the character.

3458934,0,t3_2zrufa,Funny you should ask.I just ran my second free promo and WOW. The first was months ago and while it probably would have netted me some sales I was also not actively pubbing around that time so I think I wasted whatever little bump the promo might havedid give me.But this time around and my freebie peaked at seven in one category and thirtysomething in a second. Its now sitting in the top twenty of its main category and putting this as mildly as possible I am le stoked.I am so le stoked that all Ive been doing the past seventytwo hours is smiling like a loon and randomly hugging myself. Its by far the best Ive done so far.I am running the story the full five days for maximum exposure. Your idea is nifty and I say do it both ways to see what works for youyour story. Im pretty sure at the end of the day it will hang more on the book than how many days you run it at once but dont take my word on that. Listen to the others who have been playing the game longer than I have.I didnt pick a specific day to start. It just happened to start three days ago. I dont have any evidence that weekends or weekdays are better but again you should probably just experiment around and see what days work for you.I was able to use all five days but I think that is because the story has only been in KU maybe a month.My plan is to use up all five days when I drop anything new from now on Im going to run some promos on my other stuff too to drive more eyeballs to the rest of the goodies I have to offer. I figure it cant hurt or I hope it doesnt and if it looks like it IS hurting Ill just stop doing the promos and hope to goodness the ship will correct course on its own.But TLDR? Yeeeesss do the promos and take advantage of the extra eyes you get on the rest of your work.

3837775,0,t3_34dsx3,Yes. A thousand times yes.If youll permit me going all rtheydidthemath on you for a second in theory ten titles can get you  different fourbook bundles but some of those will just be the same four books in a different order. Also that would make you an asshole.The key to bundling is theme I have for example a bunch of books bundled together as A Femdom Collection where each of the books is used only once by which I mean you can buy all of the books called A Femdom Collection without doubling up on stories. I get a lot of repeat buyers in that respect but it also frees me up to do more niche collections for example chastity lesbian BDSM cuckolding blah blah blah whenever I can reuse the stories. Also bundle your series stories but that should go without saying although maybe wait a week after the last pack goes up just to see if you can ride the wave twice.Also KU for everything. People who are borrowing your books arent going to buy them anyway  why would they when they can get an almostidentical smutbook from another writer for free on KU?

3920143,0,t3_35bcxt,I have just published seven books of Female DominationMale Submissive stories with the latest one just going up as I write this. In most of the books I have  stories totalling about  stories. I have exactly one that is written from the perspective of the female dominant. In that particular story the woman has some complicated motivations as to why she needs to enslave her husband whereas from the husbands perspective he is bonked on the head and put into permanent captivity for no really good reason. So short of a Bond villain style confession to him the story would be confusing and very short.Also the characters I write tend to be women who really know what they want and the benefits of having it. But for the men submitting to a life of servitude and pain might take a little more thinking. Thus the woman have arrived at their destination from the very beginning whereas the men have a journey to make and the story typically follows that journey.For instance My book Memoirs of a Modern Farm Slave these are men who are basically being turned into farm animals. This would exactly be the above journey.Personally my least favourite story format is one where they do this jump back and fourth between the perspective of the woman and the man.I think that it all really boils down to the fact that the idealized female dominant knows exactly who she is while the submissive male might require some guidance.,eroticauthors,cr34rxu,2,t5_2y69p

Im not new to the game. Ive had books rank below k. Its because of this experience that I know that its wrong to promise anyone  including yourself  that you can guarantee k in  hours. Its not as cutanddry as that. Sure you can increase your odds of a book performing well through experience but you can never guarantee that every book you put out will be a hit. Because it wont.To clarify Im just a little upset that youre selling lies to the gullible. This latest book of yours had NOTHING to do with  hours to k... it really seems like youre only trying to swindle these good people out of their money with this one.Summary of this bookPart  Talked about how sales rank works. More sales in a short period of time  better rank. Better rank  better visibility. Better visibility  better sales which feeds back into itself.This isnt rocket science.Part  Maintain a mailing list. People who sign up might buy your stuff.Again nothing groundbreaking here.Part  Buy and borrow all of your books. Because that extra sale and borrow per book will make a mountain of difference.No it wont.Part  Social media is pretty much useless for erotica writers. But heres a detailed description on how to gain a bunch of fake followers on Twitter anyway.Part  Dont forget to maintain your backmatter. That is all.Part  THE END.

The only problem? Sex is her only weapon and also the only thing keeping her alive.I think if you want to market this as erotica rather than a thrillersuperhero story youre going to have to get steamier with your blurb. You mention mating  is there pregnancy involved? Tentacle sex could mean cum guzzling overabundant cum etc. Werewolf could mean rough sex alpha males bdsm powerplay... I think getting into more specific detail about the sex acts in a non filterable way would help you out to market this more as erotica.Apart from that since its so long is there a plot? You mention getting her back to her husband but it seems like an afterthought. Im not sure if its her main goal or if this book is going to be a series of missions with her just happening to be able to make it back to her husband in the end.I hope this helps out a little bit.

4208066,0,t3_392b8w,Why would your books be in romance? While there is some overlap between erotica and romance where you can place your story in romance your stories dont apply AT ALL. I mean theyre literally labeled erotica on the front cover? Why would you think to place them in romance? Nobody who is looking for a quick step brother bdsm cuckold story is going to be looking in romance so not only are you probably going to get in trouble for miscategorizing down the line its not helping you out one bit. And this is coming from someone who does place some stories in romance but those characters either are in love or fall in love through the course of the story. So that is definitely my advice change all of those categories. Id work on the format of your blurbs dont space them out tremendously and make sure that your sentences are making sense. IE Ryans sex on legs. Theres not a woman around who doesnt drool at the sight of his muscular body... is kind of confusing. Just need to make sure that the excerpt makes sense out of context. But as an unknowing reader I have no idea what Ryans sex on legs means.And lastly definitely look at some other covers or buy some on fiver. Unfortunately with the amount of erotica out there its not enough to slap colored text on a stock photo. If you want to do them yourself though its best to do something dynamic with the text outlines shadows etc and use a downloaded font as opposed to the ones already on your computer just make sure theyre okay to use commercially. Just check out other titles in your category I see a few very good covers in your customers also viewed column.,eroticauthors,crzwors,2,t5_2y69p

If a reader stops in your book no matter how many pages you have in it no matter how high the payout is you dont get paid for them.  Period.On top of that big time authors never went into KU because of the low payout theyd get compared to normal sales. Why would Amazon make this change if they knew it meant those authors would get the same payout in the long run as they could now?  It makes KU no more attractive to big league novelists thus defeating the purpose of the change.

4843162,0,t1_cu4z6vn,gt I never once said in my article that I expected every writer to warn about everything.Then what are you saying they should warn against? Only the things that affect you? Thats how youre coming off. Only things that you consider serious enough or traumatic enough?Itd be really nice if you could share more of your opinion instead of getting defensive. I dont think anyone is trying to attack you. Maybe a pickle phobia seems silly or insulting to you but the general idea is still valid. Where does the line get drawn? What triggers get warnings? Which ones dont need warnings? How do we as writers make that distinction?I think this could be a really good discussion but not the way its going now.Edit Heres a less rareless insulting example. I debated on whether or not to share this since the internet is only so anonymous and its not something I tell many people. I am SEVERELY cleithrophobic similar to claustrophobia but it is a fear of being trapped as opposed to a fear of small spaces. I had something happen to me non sexual as a teenager that caused it to worsen though Ive had it since I was very little. Anyway seeing pictures hearing stories or just reading something about people being trapped can bring on severe panic attacks. Think news stories about peoples cars being covered in snow. Wont go further with examples. Its bad. Its difficult to write about it here. Now there are a lot of dubcon noncon or even just BDSM where someone cannot get out or get away. There are also plenty that arent.But my phobia isnt incredibly common. At the people who have it arent commonly affected by stories mostly by personal situations. This is as real and as painful to me as any other persons panic attacks. But can I really expect authors to put a warning about it? Personally I dont. If I come across something painful I chalk it up to a mistake and try my best to handle it. That can mean hours of crying. That can mean days of having to have every window and door open in my house. It can mean having to walk everywhere because I cant get in my car.Is it realistic to expect authors to warn me if someone gets stuck in an elevator and has an orgy versus walking into a perfectly working elevator and has an orgy? I dont think so.I digress. I guess my point is that the line is really hard to draw.,eroticauthors,cu50mtd,3,t5_2y69p

To give you an idea I was writing a humor blog and selling on Amazon in . My best month made me  in a month. In  I saw a reddit thread about a guy making  a day writing erotica. I gave it a shot. For the first  months I made between  and . After my th story sales shot up and I made  one month. Then they started banning books. I threw a tantrum and said the sky is falling! All the best times are behind us! And promptly quit writing like a petulant child. In  I was living in a new state girl broke up with me and I remembered hey! I like to write. Im going to REALLY dedicate my time to this. My best month was  and I decided to quit my job move to the beach and write full time. Then Amazon started banning again. The bans came without making any sense. Blatant rip offs of my best sellers were allowed to stay but I got banned. The world is unfair! And I quit writing again for about  months. Then I started writing again. It was slow going for a bit but then I had a story hit. Monthly sales hit  and I was back on track! Except the new KU payouts were announced. This month Im getting aid about . Next month my payout is . Have I learned my lesson? Nope. I havent been writing.The business fluctuates. There is never any consistency.

To maintain catalog quality I unpublish older smaller bundles so that singles arent in an excessive number of volumes. Theres also the prospect of releasing shorts for market testing which is what my new gay line turned out to be. Then you can bundle the singles. Yet theres something to be said for knowing when to walk away. If you havent fully exploited the mix amp match potential of your catalog you might be surprised how many new releases you can get out of that. That way youll have at least a trickle of income from erotica while you move forward on your new projects.

Go read some rwriting stuff and youll notice that even though most of them never publish anything the best advice for becoming a better writer is that you must write  a lot.  Ive gone from horrible descriptions and crappy sex scenes to compelling storylines and HD graphics as a reader said in a review that leave the reader both satisfied and wanting more.You cant do that on your first attempt at writing a short story.  According to grammarly my estimated word count last week was  words though thats everything that Ive typed in the last week not just professional writing.  So if youre going to write stories that will keep the reader coming back and become one of those key  true fans youre going to have to write a hell of a lot of words.Another way to think of it is that supposedly you become an expert in a field aka professional after youve spent  hours doing something.  I write approximately  hours every month.  Ive been doing that for  months now thats  hours per week on weeks that Im not super dedicated.  So Im not even  of the way there.Even if you dont want to make your living at writing erotica if you want to be able to write a story that will leave your reader begging you to write just one more story you need to practice.

5569597,0,t1_cwnfdlr,Itll be interesting to see how this bookstore does. Amazon isnt a stranger to taking a momentary loss for long term control. While this store may not cause a monopoly consider the impact of bestsellers. This store is only going to have  books. These books are chosen to be the top of the top. Whats Amazon really going for? Are they just trying to maximize profits? I doubt it. What I think Amazon is doing here is going after the Big Six publishers. Consider what we know of the eBook market Big Six publishers are selling less eBooks in exchange for an increase in paperbacks or hardcover books. This is caused by their decision to price their eBooks at around . pushing sales to physical books.With that information its not a stretch to see what Amazon might be trying to do here. What if they could further diminish the sales of Big Six publishers by drawing in purchases of the best selling books? Those companies would then be hurting quite bad perhaps bad enough to see ramifications that could lead to a monopoly. This ultimately does impact authors especially those that self publish. In the long term what happens when Amazon controls price points? If people arent willing to pay . for a popular bestseller what will they be willing to pay for a nobodys self published book? Were already pricing books on Amazon at a market low to compete. ,eroticauthors,cwngjzp,1,t5_2y69p

As it gets fewer downloads its search engine stats go down and its search engine ranking goes down decreasing its visibility and further decreasing its number of downloads.Also for the first three days to first week your book will be on the front page for many searches by publication date.  As that goes down along with the decreasing search engine visibility your book gets lost.  Only when people search for longtail keywords will your book get found.

But Im making the same if not more money. Ignore pricing if you will but Im just stating fact. Im a . type of guy.Ultimately both you and I have been at this for  months. Heres the way I look at it  months is no time at all to become a success. There are outliers sure but for most people in most professions in most arts in most everything...  months is a drop in the bucket its a blip its nothing. People spend a lifetime trying to make it doing what they love. It stands to reason that it might take a year or two to really make this vocation sustainable. If you look through some of the old AMAs on the subject youll see that some of the more successful people have said it wasnt until they were doing it for a year that they were making livable money. And that was in KU and before.Personally Im going long. Ive got about  titles out right now over  pennames and while Im happy for my successes I think its time to shit or get off the pot. Shorts arent going to cut it. Sure I still plan to kick a couple out to keep my penname alive for now but Ive been spending my writing days working on a clean romantic comedy novel. Its way more fun and way harder than writing shorts. But I think it will be worth it. Originally my goal was K in  weeks now Im leaning toward K in  weeks. And then Ill do it again and again get better get faster. The new age of pulp baby.Like you my savings are beginning to dwindle. I feel like Ive got another  months before I really need to worry. But shit if I can get  novels out in  months market them well who knows what tune Ill be singing by that time. Its a gamble but for me... this is the life I want.

6034055,0,t3_3y370b,This probably isnt an answer youre looking for but is that k tale of yours the edited version? Ive written works in the k and up range so I dont have a lot of room to speak I suppose but those are unedited counts and Lord also knows that number drops after editing. Theres usually lots of places where Ive used three words when one or two would do or fattened up a line more than necessary to get the point across. Lord knows Ive seen plenty of ebooks that could have really used an editors touch to cull unnecessary bits before sauntering off to print. Plenty of physical books too for that matter. You can get away with a certain amount of flab in short stories but the longer the work the more the likely for the writing to start feeling flabby to a reader. If your muse wont let you cut down the story find someone or better yet two or three people you trust to go over it for you.On the pricing point though youve got a novel on your hands so price accordingly. If short stories sell at . go for . to .. Just make sure to include a mention that its a fulllength novel and not a short story in the blurb if you publish it as erotica rather than erom or something like that. At  chapters each chapter has around  words at your word count so you could sort of think of it as a  part serial bundle if that helps.

6250114,0,t1_cytkf76,gt Why is the viagra necessary? Youre saying forced to have an erection but an erection is an involuntary reaction to stimulation. If a guy is capable of having an erection then they can be effectively forced to have one simply via stimulation.While a fair point thats not entirely correct. There is only so much a mans anatomy can support. Say for example a partner  character  whomever wanted the male to ejaculate repeatedly... Or wanted the male to remain erect for prolonged periods of time andor with minimal physical stimulation.A man who is particularly young teens twenties or particularly blessed might be able to get away with some of this without aid. But the further away from puberty a male gets the more difficult it is to do something like ejaculate repeatedly in a short span and keep getting rock hard. Or to maintain an erection for extended periods without sufficient stimulus. Drugs like viagra make overcoming these physical limitations much easier.  ,eroticauthors,cz02jvy,1,t5_2y69p

When customers contact us with quality issues in a book you published we validate the issues and send them immediately to you to fix.Starting February   we will begin showing customers a warning message on the Amazon.com Kindle store detail pages of books that contain several validated quality issues. We will remove this message for a book as soon as we receive the fixed file from you and verify the corrections  typically within  business days.We understand that even with the best quality controls defects sometimes make it through.

Agree with udbkate regarding importance of volume. Takes a while to build up an audience. Also multiple books start generating income for each other when readers decide to go through the back catalogue.Personally Im trying to stay away from dream numbers Im just happy whenever the graph lines move. I started selfpubbing recently enough that I am still tickled whenever I find out that someone paid to read something I wrote or borrowed it and read the pages. Hoping to see upticks with more publishing volume I guess Ill have a better idea about whether this is going to be something successful in a year or two... or five.Id say the more disenheartening thing about romance is that it really has to be a lot longer romance readers are always hungering for more and romance readers can be very picky.,eroticauthors,d0csytc,2,t5_2y69p

Period. That means if you do it you are risking getting slapped for it. It doesnt matter how many other people have already done it and are getting away with it. Every single time someone does it just increases the chances of it pinging the radar that this is happening and triggering Amazon to go on a spree to correct the problem as it were. Its up to each author to decide if they want to risk it or not but please dont go giving advice encouraging it based on having found others getting away with it currently on Amazon.Also I would especially warn against providing links on a public forum  which this is  which point out books squeaking by the guidelines of whats allowed or not.

7092371,0,t1_d1fwzon,Most conventional romance  certainly anything from  and before  is borderline dubcon. Due to societal pressures and the shamefulness of sexual desire and behaviour for women most of them get ravished and readers like this which allows them to abnegate responsibility. The idea is that the hero who is otherwise a highly intelligent high status highly attractive man is so overcome by the heroines devastating feminine attractiveness  even if shes a dowdy secretary because vicarious  that he can barely control himself around. This is very flattering and exciting to the heroinethe reader identifying with her.And of course as soon as he touches her in any way even if shes protesting her skin is electric at his touch and shes melting inside etc etc. This is the essential dynamic you need. Ballsy women having energetic consensual sex and taking the lead? It happens but its probably not the majority cupoftea for readers. That said Ive been twisting this in a recent story but it still returns to the essential dynamic at critical points.More modern romances arent always so coy but theres still a hell of a lot of We shouldnt!

You could also check out the romanceauthors sub which is not hugely active but Istara is always on there giving out advice to people who ask.When it comes to stuff that gets you dungeoned maybe we should ask the mod to update the FAQ as we go since the list of dungeonable terms keeps getting longer.

7305527,0,t3_4fg5uv,I think this depends on a few things so here are some to consider Are they all from one perspective? As in all written from female perspective all male all third person etc? You can usually mix third person in with either gender but Id be careful mixing a bunch of maleperspective stories with a bunch of femaleperspective stories. Similarly you should keep your lesbian erotica separate from anything with men in it even a FFM menage story. I dont know as much about MM stuff because I dont write it. How varied are we talking? You mention both tentacles and cowboy under one roof which I wouldnt recommend unless youre just starting out and even then some people have different opinions on this. Some kinks go well with each other and have a common feel to them or stem from similar things control is a big umbrella with a lot of kinks under it for example. How long are you planning on keeping the pen name? Most people from what Ive read on here tend to start with a pen name that acts as training wheels in a way. This is the pen name where you fuck up on things in the beginning and learn what works. Then you establish a new pen name that focuses on what you know works and build that up. You can sometimes carry some diehard readers over between pen names which helps a bit. Or you keep your original pen name and you take down the stories that didnt do well and keep plugging away at whatever goldmine kink you found. As a reader what do you like to see when you click on someones author page? Do you like to see a lot of variety in stories some of which you dont like or a common nichethemefocus that makes the stories more similar? Considering your own taste in these things can be helpful when making decisions.Ultimately its up to you what you do. I threw everything under one pen name and then found a niche that stuck for me. I still use that first pen name but have taken down some of the stories that tanked and were oneshots in niches I dont write in. It cleaned up my back matter a bit and now all the kinks play nice with each other. Now Im moving to eromromance and will be starting a new pen name with no erotica under it. I dont know if thats necessary for everyone to do especially if you plan to do more erom than romance but Im sure someone will chime in with their opinion ,eroticauthors,d28l7wt,6,t5_2y69p

Hire an editor for serious errors. Read the  star reviews to give you a boost. I think it helps the soul to get praise.

Do some draw certain niche readers as opposed to others? In the FAQ it says lighter colored covers sell better. Makes sense if readers are looking at small images.

8279909,0,t1_d5c39h6,Is this supposed to be a cuckold genre story? Or is it an erotic romance story with a cuckold genre element? Its hard to tell from the blurb as written and the difference to potential readers is vast.Ill leave it to the experts to weigh in on telling a genre cuckold story from everyones POV except the husband. But as an ER reader There are a number of questions Id want answered before I clicked on the Look Inside button.Please tell me why would all hell break loose on a sports team just because a player even a star is fooling around with a married woman? Unless shes the team owners wife mistress or daugnter its hard to see the simple fact that theyre hooking up become such a big deal to the team that the entire story hangs around it. Doesnt that kind of thing happen all the time?After that itd be nice to know exactly what is so fascinating about Amanda. We know Robs a hot celebrity athlete that attraction is understandable. But whats so special about her out of all the multitude of gorgeous women in Paris?And lastly how does it become Amandas choice of rules to play by? Why does she end up in control of a situation that seems to involve the internal workings of a sports team shes only associated with via infidelity?All of these things may be explained away perfectly well in the story but readers wont ever get there if the blurb doesnt hook them in.,eroticauthors,d5cjq5b,2,t5_2y69p

8529086,0,t3_4wjvwi,Well Ive always loved to read and Ive been writing things since early grade school. I always knew I wanted to write and publish it was just a matter of when. As I got older I turned from Junie B Jones and Magic Treehouse to Romance and Erotic Romance. I read a lot of historical romance when I was younger. I think some of my first older books were Judith McNaught and Danielle Steele and I just started picking up more and more and any ones with sexy covers. A lot of Harlequin books because they were at the thrift store and giveaways. It was pretty natural for me to move to writing Romanceor Erotica stuff. In middle school my close friends knew I wrote racy things haha And I kept a fantasy journal in high school. Then I discovered this subreddit in  and writing now instead of waiting until I was older and more experienced seemed possible. Some of my favorite writers that I can think of right now are Aliyah Burke Lora Leigh Gaelen Foley Kristen Ashley Nalini Singh and sooooo many more. ,eroticauthors,d67p6tz,2,t5_2y69p

A Belgian civilian finding himself on the wrong end of a gun barrel. Two men caught in the beginning of the bloodiest conflict in modern historyWorld War One.gtCan they survive the threats of war and the discrimination that they face as they fall in love? As they confront their own losses will they find the best way to heal is possibly with each other?gtA tale of historical love in the face of adversity in a time when love between two men wasnt understood at all Changing Seasons will sweep you off your feet and leave you wanting more.gtThis book contains adult language and explicit adult activities it is intended for . Approximately  words in length. Can be read as a standalone book no major cliffhanger HFN ending. Mixture of eroticaromance.Unsure if I need that last bit but I like to be safe with things.

Thanks guys!REVISIONGabriel was the last survivor of his village. Family wiped out and homes torn apart by the Germans he stepped back into his torn village looking for anything to salvage and make new again.The last thing he had expected to find was a lone German soldier wounded and escaping the war. And for some reason feelings he didnt know existed were showing up.Mistrust turns into pity. But can pity turn into love?Bastian was running. Running away from a painful past and hoping to escape the present too. Death and war was all around him and when he ran straight into Gabriel a sudden strong chemistry formed that he hadnt felt in a long time.

About the torso vs to including faces Im still trying to figure that out. But I tend to agree with you my books without faces plainly showing sold better.      As for the length of the books like it has already been recommended I too would suggest you to shorten them and write between K and K. Thats what you are looking at when talking about pure Erotica Shorts.   Over k  its ok to start experimenting Erom and then when you got your hands dirty with that you may wanna look at KK for real Romance but before switching to that you need to experience with shorts first. Im on my th month with Erotica shorts and the road ahead is still very long but as long as Im seeing improvements in all aspects    and I have to thank all the great threads posted on here for this  Im extremely happy and motivated. Yet I cant deny I have very bad frustrating moments at times. Sigh.       What Ive personally learned is to never stop learning. Never. Always question yourself and try different things. I know this may sound like a clich now because its been suggested thousands of times but its definitely true Research research research  Write write write  publish publish publish!

9675638,0,t1_da5jvne,gtWell it helps in that it disables pageflip which many think is at the heart of at least some of the problemInitially responded on my phone so cleaning up now and adding a lot more info.Vellum does not disable page flip.  There are two page flips enhanced and regular.  Enhanced shows thumb nails to move easily though the book but page flip itself is available regardless of the formatting or how its formatted.  Additionally page flip is available when a book is sideloaded into a Kindle which means its not something Amazon is doing but something in the Kindle which follows considering that different devices are showing different behaviors.So to clear the myths.  Enhanced typsetting is not the flag that allows page flip.  Books with enhanced typesetting have page flip enabled books without enhanced typesetting have page flip enabled.  There are two things at play here.  Page flip and enhanced page flip.  These are two different things.  Enhanced page flip which is where the drop caps and svg might play a role is not an issue because readers would never read in enhanced page flip.  Whereas page flip is more convenient to read in hence why its a problem and there is no known way to turn it off because its device based.  There is no consistent way that anyone knows of to disable page flip.I also wanted to add that the author of the post is an employee of Vellum.  So while his information came from a theory that was bounced around for a while and was sound as far as a theory goes while a group is trying to figure out an issue it was actually very quickly disproven.,eroticauthors,da5q4i6,4,t5_2y69p

It was unavoidable really.I dont subscribe to that philosophy of life though. I dont believe in things got in the way. I do believe in the concept of letting priorities slip though which is what I did the past two weeks and my sales show that with a slow steady decline.

Get within shouting distance of finishing the story Im working on.. I hit publish last night. That story wrapped out...that story...and a bundle.

10325960,0,t1_dce75y9,gtI have some pretty serious social anxiety issues and have been unemployed for a few months. I dont have the psychological or financial strength to go to a doctor for treatment let alone hold a job in public. My bank account is getting closer to zero every month. My hope with erotica was to make a few hundred dollars per month just to get by for a few months. And then build from there. But now it looks like its going to be a few months before money starts coming in at all. And then if Im lucky Ill hit the jackpot of  per month.The good news? Although it might be the last thing you want to hear youre not alone. Many of the people here share your struggle or have similar issues. For some its crippling anxiety. For others its depression. This community takes all kinds and not only encourages you to be open about your struggles but will actively support you in your journey. There is no judgment here.Now the bad news even if you start making hundreds of dollars right now youre not going to see it until the end of March.And back to the good news again luck has nothing to do with it. You can be as successful as you want to be. You just have to invest in the work and invest in yourself. Its going to be scary. Its going to take you outside of your comfort zone and there will be times when you screw up or when it doesnt seem like youre making any progress. Keep at it. Dont give yourself any other option but to succeed. Try. Fail. Learn. Try again. Just dont stop until youre rolling in the bucks.gtRight now it takes me all day to get through  words. I dont know how you guys do  words a day some days and how youd possibly do that while holding down a fulltime job. Maybe someday Ill figure out how to do this.Shit. Id like to be writing K a day. Or even half that. How many words you write every day matters less than the fact that you write every day. Speed is something you get with practice.

10464690,0,t3_5mcxyq,First off I think youre really idealizing office work. To paraphrase the guys from the Podcast Home Work I thought working at an office would be like The Office. It wasnt.Its entirely possible you will hate your job hate your coworkers and find them entirely backstabbing and nobody youd want to be friends with. Or theyll be acquaintances and not form meaningful bonds. Or youll hate the work and find it drudgery and ten years down the line youll hate yourself for never taking on that writing dream.You wont waste your life if you take  days or a year off to see if writing full time is for you. And if it isnt you can always do it on the side. Theres a lot of books on how to balance a job and writing at the same time. I liked Pen on FireTheres a lot of good suggestions in here. Id like to add that you might try writing in a library to supplement writing in Starbucksother cafes. Itll help change things up and theres a lot less chance of you buying something. Itll also be more helpful if youre prone to being distracted too easily by the chatter of a cafe. ,eroticauthors,dcua1ym,1,t5_2y69p
10554506,0,t1_dd3hrb7,One aspect of my wheel spinning is that I dont want to commit to any particular niche until I get some semblance of traction. So Ive got single books in a variety of niches and none of them are getting as much as a glance most days. Theres not a lot of data to learn from if no one is even touching them. If I had even one book that started pulling down a dollar per day Id latch on to that and for the next one try to fiddle with it to make it a day book. And then maybe put out a few more like those until Im making maybe day and see what patterns are emerging and so on.But right now its just a few books earning nothing per day or a penny per day or nine cents per day and I dont know what to learn from that other than do something different next time.edit all that said youre right about everything and also I love the clay story so I am just going to keep making pots until one looks nice.,eroticauthors,dd4h0a1,2,t5_2y69p

If it meant paying and knowing that Facebook doesnt treat my data like its plaything as opposed to not paying and letting them do as they wish I know which Id prefer... but this is not a model that many people will move to.The Adam Ruins Everything episode on this is pretty enlightening although naturally hyperbolic.gtIts ridiculous from an ethical standpoint though though I stopped believing Facebook really cares what its users think a long time ago now so I doubt they care about ethics any further than What can we get away with?Ethically though... yeah I agree with you. But this is big money corporate shit where you an individual user mean next to nothing to them because overall the userbase will continue to turn a blind eye to the potential for abuse.Its also just as ridiculous from an ethical point of view that Google is a hundred times more invasive if you like me browse the Internet on Chrome and use an Android phone as well as search using Google... theres almost nothing about you they dont know but thats a story for another topic.Also Amazon mastering targeted advertising is essentially how our market exists and how we continue to sell our books so in some way we are culpable and contribute to the problem.

Perhaps that can guide you a bit through determining where their heads are at when they go into the scene hopefully the plots are different. For example if the heroine is struggling to prove herself in a professional setting use the sex scene to reflect her need to feel empowered. Let her be on top.

11044235,0,t3_5xp3nr,Reaching out for advice is as easy as writing an email but some authors are more receptive than others. Dont take it personally if you dont get a reply. Its all about building relationships and that sort of thing takes time and patience. It might also do good to join Facebook groups in your niche as well as community groups like the Slack here at EA.As for newsletter trades some authors are more mercenary than others and will expect something of a similar value to what youre requesting in return. Others are more protective of their businesses and might not be willing to take a chance on recommending your book to their readers because they might not be at all familiar with you at all.The bottom line is that everyone pays their dues one way or the other. If youre just starting out the best thing you can do is to continue to publish and grow your own list organically. Learn new skills and become a more visible member of the community as a whole while building a positive reputation for yourself.

11210310,0,t3_5zzbki,  I havent done any bundles yet so I dont have any advice from experience. But as a reader I would be annoyed if I bought two or three bundles that all had the same stories in them. Though if you are very specific in the description and let them know which stories are in which bundle and let them know that these same stories are in these other bundles too then Id say you might as well keep them all up.  Just be very clear and let readers know their options.  ,eroticauthors,df2ocfl,1,t5_2y69p

11244686,0,t1_df67ae5,I dont have all the answers but I do know this just from reading film theory and critique as well as my print media coursesWhen youre using imagery and photoshopping them together it can be extremely hard to make them play nice together. Try overlaying a color to give both images similar saturation and you might find blending the top two pictures easier. I cant remember where I saw this information Im like  sure it was on Cracked and featured them photoshopping a face over a mans nipple but if I can find it andor a photoshop tutorial showing how you can blend pictures more easily together Ill come back and link it.Edit Heres the article from Cracked ,eroticauthors,df6kh47,2,t5_2y69p

11538140,0,t3_64nis8,First off if theyve been posted for free forget Kindle Unlimited. You can still sell them on KDP until Amazon finds the freebies and price matches but not KU. Second k is short for a short. Add a little story before and after and youll likely hit right around k which is just about right.In your shoes Id start by figuring out what kinks youve written and develop a pen name for each toplevel niche. Then Id research how those kinks sell study top blurbs and covers and figure out how the hell to nail it first go. Then Id publish and learn from all my mistakes.,eroticauthors,dg3umke,6,t5_2y69p
11540240,0,t3_64jq7h,. Write  words. . Edited and published  novellas  one Id had sitting around on my computer forever that Id published in a box set previously but now its out there my own so it kinda counts as my first? Yay! And the other with my cowriter. I put it out there without any back matter and no promo no website no newsletter just a decent cover and words written with no thought it would sell until I had a few out and started promoting but its in an underserved niche right now and people picked it up right away and I had to scramble to get my structure in place. As of right now Ive made over  estimating a low page read count of . and if my rank stays under k I should clear close to a thousand between the two at the end of the month. Guh. All credit on that to my cowriter. She does crazy amounts of market research.. Start daily writing streak of at least  story words. I had a busy week last week with setting up a pen name and everything that goes along with it website newsletter blog email author central etc etc and only wrote about  words. I can do better than that. I have one story with my cowriter waiting for her to wrap up some projects and write the next chapter and I told her to focus on the other projects because they have a due date and I have the second book started of the first one I published. So words on either of these. I tend to be most productive at the beginning of the day and most creative at the end of the day but my computer is really too big to take to bed with me so Im going to try to get words done in the morning if the minion will let me. Otherwise itll be zombie night words.,eroticauthors,dg436ls,1,t5_2y69p
11541225,0,t1_dg46fan,gt In closing Ill tell you this since Im about your age and thought the same thing on occasion everyone isnt having these fantastic group socialization parties lol. You may think they are but they arent. Most people our age are actually busy working three jobs a week and barely trying to keep the house clean have a relationship and time to enjoy all the effort we put in. Its really going to be okay. This is so damn true. Im also  and it seems to be the age where most of us have grown out of the binge drink and do crazy shit every weekend phase and onto the I need to graduateestablish my careerpay back my loans phase. I have to literally pencil in social interaction with my friends each week and even then sometimes it doesnt happen. People are busy its life. One thing that helped was talking on the phone instead of texting constantly. The conversation goes more indepth and people vent more when they dont have to type it out with their thumbs. So if you text with your friends constantly then finding a time when you can call or skype might really help.I also second the going for a walk idea. I take my dog out daily to go around the neighborhood and even just seeing a neighbor and waving hello makes me feel like Ive done some socializing for the day. Then again Im basically a hermit IRL and sometimes I consider smalltalk with the cashier at the grocery store to be enough socializing for one day p,eroticauthors,dg4772y,3,t5_2y69p

11558191,0,t1_dg637gt,This is a great answer!Yeah Im definitely seeing a lot more wide  hybrid strategies. It seems like more and more authors are trying to think longterm and Amazons general fuckery just isnt the most stable environment in which to do that. Also for uNotMyRealName  the other big thing I see is audiobooks. They seem to be everywhere lately. I have no idea how lucrative it is for erotica at this point but I can definitely see it having legs. I was reading this article just the other day on Forbes maybe? Or Business Insider? about audiobooks and how everyone is so obsessed with productivity these days that theyre using audiobooks so that they can multitask while brushing their teeth cooking dinner etc. Doesnt necessarily lend itself to erotica lol but I think its only a matter of time before audio becomes a default way of consuming written media.,eroticauthors,dg64ilv,3,t5_2y69p
