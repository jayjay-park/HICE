251772,0,t3_1wztin,The rest of the league probably wont see your comment. Id recommend posting in your message board.If after some discussion you are still in disagreement with the league then let us know and ask the other manager to comment in this thread post the link to the thread in your league message board so other members can comment with any other information and then the review board can vote.The trade is pretty lopsided. Lillard and Duncan are the two best players in the deal and Holiday doesnt hold enough value to make up for it imo. Is it vetoable? meh..it is a close one.,RedditCantJump,cf6umpp,1,t5_2vf9m

568941,0,t1_cg4x9o3,To be fair I did join MJ league before you. I remember you were trying to join a different league but had some problems with your account and got stuck with MJ league after all the other leagues filled so you only have yourself to blame for this!,RedditCantJump,cg4xzjz,3,t5_2vf9m
