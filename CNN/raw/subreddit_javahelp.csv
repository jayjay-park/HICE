2207382,0,t1_cljzd6e, is the most similar to  except you need to add the calculation methods surface area  volume so you should not have too much trouble there if you completed  requires creating a basic GUI which is easy if your IDE has a built in GUI designer. I use Idea  However its a good idea to also understand how to do this by hand. Typically you start with a JFrame which you can extend from your main class and add JPanels  JTextFields  JTextArea  JButton using a layout. Learning how the different layouts work is actually the most complex thing which it sounds like you havent covered in your class. If you use a GUI designer it will handle all of that for you but as mentioned its good to know how they work without a tool  coding by hand.If you make all of the text related GUI components member variables of the main class and implement the ActionListener interface as well you then add a method defining actionPerformed in the main class which will query the text related GUI components usually by their getText method and print things out as the assignment requests. Because you implemented ActionListener in your main class for the Send button you can set the callback for the button using the this reference of the main class like addActionListenerthis to direct the click action to the main class. For your assignment you dont have to make things pretty per se just basically functioning. Technically this program should be no more than  lines of code or thereabout. ,javahelp,clkeuhw,1,t5_2t1jq
2235700,0,t3_2kqwvn,Thats because the java awt interface for modifiers is fucking stupid.Normally if the method would make sense it would return a List of all modifiers held down.Instead it returns a number utterly stupid as it is.  This number obviously consists of zeros and ones. Imagine you get the number   from getModifiers. Now listen closely Every position in this number represents one key. If the position is  that key is not pressed if it is  that key is pressed. So this number   means that two modifiers are held down.How can we now find out from this number which single key has been pressed? We have to do it with fucking binary arithmetics like a fucking ancient moron.So you know you can AND two bits together and OR them together and XOR and so on  AND     AND   ? Thats what you have to do here.Basically InputEvent.CTRLMASK defines another number with a single bit set to  for example  . We can now AND this number with the number returned from getModifiers. What happens if we AND our two example numbers?             AND          Now you see the resulting number is all . This means that CTRL was not held down. If instead our getModifiers number looked like this   and we did the same operation             AND          we would get a number that is not equal to  this means the CTRL key was held down.Now that you understand how it works you can apply the logic to your program itself. In java you can bitAND together two values with the operator amp note that ampamp means a boolean AND it only ANDs booleans. amp does it for any number.You should be able to write the expression yourself now if you still have problems or something is unclear ask away!And the stupidest motherfucking fuck thing is that this fucking shit you have to do is documented in fucking no place for a new programmer to find. returns the bitwiseor of the modifier constants as if anyone new to this shit would understand that.

2246761,0,t3_2kwslk,It feels like this is doing too much and too little at the same time.  Why for instance would one use beforeJ.next.next when myJ.next gives the same reference?I would step through this with a debugger looking at the values of everything both before and after each change.  If youre really not comfortable with a debugger you can use System.out.println but you should really get comfortable stepping through your code.Its all a little confusing.  getNodeBefore seems roundabout especially when one invokes getNodeBeforej   to get the node at position j.  Finally I suspect that the results you get from this will be different if i and j are sequential than if theyre several steps away from each other.  You should be able to predict perfectly what everything will look like after each assignment and so you can compare what you get with what you expect to find when things begin to go wrong.Do yourself a favor and test with i and j being   and  at the very least.  See what happens if one of them is zero too.  I think you will find the results illuminating.,javahelp,clpezvm,1,t5_2t1jq

Example        class HybridListltMyElementgt             ArrayListltMyElementgt list            MyElement treeRoot                   class MyElement                 int value                MyElement left                MyElement right                constructor etc.                       public void addint i                MyElement elem  new MyElementi null null              list.addelem               if treeRoot  null treeRoot  elem               else doBSTInsertelem                    public MyElement getint i               return list.geti                    private void doBSTInsertMyElement e               MyElement current  treeNode              while current ! null                    if e.value lt current..go left                  else go right..             i.e. normal BST insertion here                            Now when you need to do a binary search do a BSTSearch using treeRoot and compare values. When you need to get something by index. just call geti.    The challenging thing with this can be deletion  you will also have to modify the tree structure so it reflects the change but preserves the BST property. But you surely can google binary search tree delete element    Now the funnies part is that with binary search you really dont need all this hassle. Your goLeft and goRight equivalents are exactly what the algorithm does  split the thing in too compare the value proceed left if smaller right if greater repeat. But for that to work you will have to keep your list sorted at all times. Its a tradeoff you see.     ,javahelp,cmlwm52,1,t5_2t1jq

2754852,0,t1_cnh7af3,Edited for clarity but your first suggestion has similar issues the chance of getting an item is inversely proportional to the number of items in your table. It may take many rolls to drop a single item.Easiest approach Give every item a likelihood rating make this a long.When loot drops sum the likelihood of all drops from that mob. Call this sum. If you want a chance of no drop either put nothing in the loot table or increase this sum by the likelihood of dropping nothing.While we are calculating sums calculate the cumsum of likelihood ratings for all possible drops.Roll a random long X between  and sumStart at beginning of loot list and the first item in the db whose cumsum is greater than x drops. If x is greater than the highest cumsum nothing drops.It is basically the original implementation without worrying about summing to  so it will be easy to implement for op.,javahelp,cnh7qwp,1,t5_2t1jq

You perform everything inside the outer most parens i times. Everything in the inner parens you do j times. Multiplying everything you get ijc  ic. As variables in an equation get very large constants tend to mean less and less not always. This results in ij  i. In addition to constants lower power terms tend to mean less and less as numbers get large since what are constants if not variables to the zero power. Therefore the term that best describes the behavior of the equation is ij and since they are so close you can probably say n.,javahelp,cnjqrf7,1,t5_2t1jq

You would usually use replace or replaceAll for this or iterate over the string.The other way is to use Javas build in formatting capabilities. There is for example String.format or the SimpleDateFormat class. These take a format string template themselves and format Objects accordingly. You could for example construct a Date with the values of the duration and a SimpleDateFormat with the specified template string and then format the Date with the SimpleDateFormat. For this to work the template string syntax would need to be the same though which it isnt. For example in you case S means seconds in  digits while SimpleDateFormat interprets it as milliseconds.,javahelp,co2e388,1,t5_2t1jq

3074316,0,t3_2vdbio,Alright as usomnolent said youre never calling getArea on your Shapes. More specifically for all your shapes youre calling     System.out.printlnshapeBut then in the toString method for the shapes youre not doing anything that relates to the Area. As a result youre printing something just not what you want.What I would do is change the signature of your getArea methods to    public String getArea instead of what it is and instead of simply printing out to the screen here I would return the Area of the Shape as a String. This is because the name of the method youre using is getArea and you should always give something back when a function says its a get. Then in your toString method I would call getArea like so    public String toString         return getArea    Now calling System.out.printlnshape will print out the Area you return in getArea.

3514535,0,t3_30ix2n,Well this is pretty messy and I dont know enough about your program and logic to discuss architecture changes  but I can show you how to clean up a mess of code like that.The first thing you want to do is make this as easy to understand as possible. Dont worry about performance  this is entirely a problem of readability. First thing I would do is get local variables for those slots and replace the method calls just to reduce the amount of text    Slot slot  getSlot    Slot slot  getSlot    Slot slot  getSlotRight away I see some special conditions in your logic. For example at the bottom all three slots cant be held. So lets break that into its own isolated condition and break out of your code immediately if thats found     return false if all of the slots are held    ifslot.isHold ampamp slot.isHold ampamp slot.isHold        return falseThen you have a valid image check so lets get rid of that next     return false if an invalid image is held    if!validIcons.containsslot.getImageName        return falseNow keep in mind you might be tempted to combine this with the first condition I wrote. When you are dealing with something as confusing as this dont do it! Just leave it as a separate condition so whoever is reading it can digest these concepts one at a time. Now I may be confusing this next part but in order to get  in a row all images must be the same right? So why dont we check that one time and finish off the image stuff.     return false if all the images do not match    if!slot.getImage.equalsslot.getImage ampamp slot.getImage.equalsslot.getImage        return falseNow all you are left with is your holding logic. But does this really matter? You know at this point that all  slots arent held because the very first condition stops that. So who cares who is holding what? Obviously Id ask you to test this part but I believe you might just be able to return true at this point since we know that all the images match and the image is valid and any remaining holding situation should be valid. If this is true you can change the last code I wrote above to just this     return true if all the images match    return slot.getImage.equalsslot.getImage ampamp slot.getImage.equalsslot.getImageAll together now    Slot slot  getSlot    Slot slot  getSlot    Slot slot  getSlot     return false if all of the slots are held    ifslot.isHold ampamp slot.isHold ampamp slot.isHold        return false     return false if an invalid image is held    if!validIcons.containsslot.getImageName        return false     return true if all the images match    return slot.getImage.equalsslot.getImage ampamp slot.getImage.equalsslot.getImageNotice how much easier this is to read compared to your initial block. All it takes is a few one sentence comments to explain whats happening and we can break out of the method immediately if certain conditions are met making it easy to read through.

5083201,0,t1_cuymayb,Right. I am looking for a somewhat generic answer assuming unidirectional groups as Ive faced this problem multiple times. Im used to programming with C where theres no iterators so Im not really sure what the related best practices are for Java.Still Ill explain my current use case in my current project which is an optimization project for a LowLevel Synthesizer which basically parses BLIF files describing logic functions and creates a circuit description that implements these functions using registerslogic gatesetc. To be exact this is in one of the simplest parts of the optimization algorithm and is used very often as a quick and dirty optimization pass in the middle of more complex optimization algorithms so performance is critical.A and B describe logic cubes of a single logic function which are vectors of   Dont Care also represented as X indicates both  and  are accepted or Illegal Value indicating error each entry in these vectors describes a single input. These cubes describe outputs related to inputs. For example a cube X would be true if the inputs are  or  and false otherwise. In technical terms a logic cube is an ninput output Programmable Logic Array PLA description.For memory reasons as we often have thousands of cubes each with hundreds of inputs they use a custom collection implementation where each entry uses  bits in a vector of longs very similar to the Java BitSet implementation. This memoryefficient implementation while necessary the user wont have ridiculous amounts of RAM most likely together with the huge number of inputs makes any operation on the cubes itself very expensive.Im trying to find superfluous logic cubes. A logic cube B is superfluous if there exists an AB where for all inputs for which B is true A is also true. As an example lets assume I have the logic cubes of  inputs each AX B and C. A is true for the inputs  and  while B is true for  and C for . This means that AB fulfills the condition since A contains all true inputs of B therefore B is superfluous and can be deleted. A and C however are not superfluous and need to be kept.An important characteristic of such a superfluous logic cube is that if BC fulfills the condition and AB as well then AC also fulfills the condition for sure both B and C are superfluous. Another characteristic is that if AB fulfills the condition BA can only fulfill it if A is exactly equal to B. This results in the fact that if you find that AB fulfills the condition then it is unnecessary to check any other pair containing B. In addition if AB we only want to remove one of them.Since checking the condition is expensive mostly due to the memoryefficient implementation of the Cubes themselves I want to remove B from the list immediately after finding a pair AB which fulfills it so that I dont iterate through more pairs containing B.Im currently using the indexed outer loop approach as doing a logic cube list traversals is cheaper than checking the condition more times than needed still Id appreciate some tips on how to avoid the expensive list.geti.This is the current code. c.containsc returns true if c c fulfills the condition c is superfluous. Otherwise it returns false.    public void removeDuplicates         forint i   i lt cList.size i             Cube c  cList.geti            ListIteratorltCubegt it  cList.listIterator            whileit.hasNext                 int i  it.nextIndex                Cube c  it.next                ifc  c                    continue                ifc.containsc                     it.remove                    ifi lt i                        i                                        Assuming I want to be a good guy and follow the assurances given by the documentation in the nested iterator implementation I am not allowed to call it.remove as that will invalidate it. Any other alternative I can come up with like the one above has large downsides. My question therefore is are there best practices for such a case where we have a nested iteration over the same list and want to modify it in the inner loop or do I have to accept a loss of performance with no alternative other than ignoring the warning in the documentation and hoping the underlying implementation which might be outside of my control doesnt mind?I mean theres always the alternative of implementing a linked list myself with a custom iterator that guarantees such a thing but that seems like too much work.,javahelp,cuypwhe,1,t5_2t1jq

6855893,0,t3_49of3e,. Think about refactoring the code. You dont need two independent loops. This can be done by setting a start value depending on whether to use  or   its perfectly ok to write for loops as forint i  startValue i lt numRows i. Use proper code formatting. Each code block should be indented and the curly braces should match the indentation.. its useless to check the same boolean variable twice once for  true and a second time for  false. Boolean variables are either true or false so a simple else will suffice.. You can reuse loop variables. There is no need to declare individual variables for each loop group. Also it is common to use the forint k  ... syntax if you only need the variable in the loop.,javahelp,d0tf9my,1,t5_2t1jq

For example if you are using eclipse this individual here  goes through how to use the debugger and how to watch variables. Every IDE netbeans itelliJ and so forth is similar to each otherbut probably require you to do something slightly different. As for the other comment. It seems you understand up to the last line so lets use an analogy. Say person n is on a street and person n can currently see three houses. The house currently closest to n is  and furthest is  and of coarse in between is house . Now lets pretend n is suddenly teleported and as n is being teleported a new house appears in between  and  ... we will call this house  n is teleported to  if it isnt clear.  Now when n materializes it can only see houses  and  because n cant see the houses behind it. However even though n cant see behind it those houses do not get destroyed. They are still there but unless we teleport n to the head of the street n does not know about them anymore. There are limitations to this analogy as it is not  accurate as n doesnt know if there is  or  more houses ahead or what is behind it. All it knows what is the next nodes reference and what value n is assigned to in this case .  ,javahelp,d1fuov6,2,t5_2t1jq

7307337,0,t1_d28bo9e,On a colors level if you are holding a solved rubiks cube with the red side facing you the orange side will not change when you rotate the red side.  If you rotate clockwise the closest row of yellow moves to green closest row of green moves to white closest row of white moves to blue closest row of blue moves to yellow.  If you keep the red side facing you with white on top and rotate the right edge upwards you are really rotating the blue face clockwise.  Though from an understanding logic standpoint it is probably easier to orient by which face you are looking at and rotate it clockwisecounterclockwise instead of worrying about rotating anything updown or rightleft which could be handled in the program by calling the rotate method of the appropriate face if designed correctlyThere is a bit of a complication with a x that the x doesnt experience in that if you look at it from the facing side you can rotate the front or the nd level where a x only has a front to rotate as the cube faces youignoring side rotations as above.  When you rotate the nd level from you only the connected Faces actually change the front face does not change.Depending on the level of class there are a few ways this could be represented through data structures.

9276203,0,t3_57g0s4,I think whether or not your exceptions are checked actually has a pretty big bearing on how I would answer your question. If you use Optional like some folks indicated below that option is very similar to using a checked exception as in both cases the calling code MUST handle whatever the outcome is. Whether the Optional is empty or a checked exception is thrown its going to be much more obvious to the caller of your code that they need to deal with it that situation.On the other hand an unchecked exception starts getting you into hairy scenarios where the calling code could ignore it and let it bubble up in a way that becomes hard to keep track of and could lead to other unrelated code that doesnt even know it should be looking for a certain exception. Ive even seen some folks equate unchecked exceptions with being the equivalent of abusing GOTO.Anyhow in your scenario I think Optionals or checked exceptions have basically the same effect and either is acceptable. I personally prefer using Optionals whenever possible to indicate its possible and expected for a method call to not return a value. I tend to prefer exceptions to situations where the outcome of them being thrown is a little bit more exceptional and unexpected.EDIT Also I wanted to throw in one more thing about your question asking if its too much to create lots of granular exceptions. My personal opinion isnt just that it is ok but that it is preferable. If you use very generic exceptions and just change the message you make it difficult for someone catching the exceptions to decide how to handle it. A great example of this is the exceptions that JPA throws... they are very generalDo you have any idea how much stuff in most ORMs just throws a generic PersistenceException with a different message for the specific error? This makes it extremely difficult when writing a web app to translate some of those errors into HTTP codes which are much more granular.,javahelp,d8rtpj0,1,t5_2t1jq

9544306,0,t3_5bm7xd,It seems you are mixing up keys and values. I believe you want a map of String keys and Integer values which makes your declaration of count correct. The incorrect part is in your loop where you are using count.geti where i is an int.However the HashMap.get function returns the value for a given key parameter. Since counts keys are of type String passing get an int parameter which would probably be autoboxed to Integer will never get a match. Thus list.contains will always receive the argument null and always return false.I would try writing out the algorithm as a state machine or in pseudocode on a piece of paper and understanding that first before putting it into code.Lastly its generally discouraged to start variable names with an underscore  e.g. list but its not going to break your code. Oh and using the increment operator in an expression e.g. count.putlist.geti countValue is also discouraged because it tends to be more confusing than the alternative.

You can put an implementation in the abstract classes and then you dont have to deal with copying this code across all of the concrete implementations  all you need to worry about is the specifics of each skill which the abstract class can declare an abstract method e.g doSkill to implement the actual skill which is what you will implement in say the Fireball class.e.g DirectSkill only affects one Character  so the implementation in the abstracts method perform would be something like call doSkill on the character that was passed into me. AreaSkill can affect multiple characters so already there is a different implementation here because you need call doSkill on say a List of characters that was passed in making sure they are within the AoE area before calling doSkill on the specific Character. Depending on what the concrete class extends determines which method gets called  but once youve written that code you can then add as many DirectAreaSkills as you want without ever having to worry about how the perform method does the calculations. All you need to do is implement what the actual doSkill does e.g decreases targets hp by  and the rest is already taken care of,javahelp,dbkwj21,1,t5_2t1jq

10490118,0,t1_dcx3kiw,In many programming languages doing math between two integers also returns an integer.  Java also does this.The fix is to cast one or both of the arguments to a double first.On a side note Java will automatically do widening conversions as needed. In the above code its doing it when it stores headsPercentage.  However Java also does this when youre doing math operations to make both numbers the same type.It always converts to the type with the widest range.  From smallest to largest the ranges are byte short   char but please dont do math on char int long float double,javahelp,dcx5ycg,3,t5_2t1jq

As far as it working when you moved the jar  this is probably because the Curr directory gets added to the classpath by default  so the files there are available as resources.

10610984,0,t1_ddadjy6,Youve fallen into the trap of using inheritance for code reuse. This is actually a really bad thing to do and bad advice... in anything but the most basic projects you run into a hierarchical mess after youve added more classes refactored a few forced some things to fit etc.Also since youre not even storing state youre just using the base class in order to override its method you are far better off using an interface and using composition over inheritance to get the required behaviour. You dont even lose any of the benefits because you just create lists of the interface instead.Subclasses should only extend another class if they have an IS A relationship with that class. A monster is NOT a drawable.. they dont represent nearly the same thing. A more specific type of monster however e.g goblin IS A monster.

10793861,0,t1_ddt7jyt,gt Im actually really surprised that compiles I feel like that should throw an error.Why should it throw an error? There is nothing wrong with the statement as such.The main difference is that .equals and its variants compare the contents of the Strings and  compares the object references think memory locations. Had you read the link that Ive posted in my previous comment that is also linked in the sidebar you would have understood the reasoning.There are certain cases where you want to use  to compare objects when you want to test if two objects are the same object i.e. if they have the same memory reference. Swing Actionlisteners use that concept a lot.It wouldnt even make sense to throw a warning because it could definitely be in the intent of the programmer to compare the object references and not the actual content.,javahelp,ddtb6fu,1,t5_2t1jq

11399731,0,t3_62ob32,Well my biggest critique of your game is that it isnt proper object orientated programming. A class in Java is supposed to represent whatever your class is named after. Classes have field members and methodsthere are others but they arent as important that make up your class.Methods fall in one of three categories actions getters and setters.  So for example if you wanted to represent an Apple class you may have a Color objectwhich does actually exist which can be accessed by an instance of the Apple class using    public Color getColor             return color object here might look like return appleColor    or can be set using that same instance    public void setColorColor aColor             set the current value here might look like appleColor  aColor    actions depend on whatever you want it to do. For example if I wanted to create a eat method which reduces the amount of apple not yet eaten based on an int value passed to it like so    public void eatint percent            percentNotEaten  percentNotEaten  percent    In your code you also use extend improperly. To extend something in java is to inherit all methodsand other info related to of that class. You should only extend something if the class your making is a more specific version of the class your extending.,javahelp,dfo58bz,1,t5_2t1jq
