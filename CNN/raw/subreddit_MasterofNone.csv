5658254,0,t1_cwy9qpx,gt My prediction for a season  if it happens is that neither Dev nor Rachel will actually spend a year in their respective destinations. If were being realistic here and as noted in the show its crazy to just fly away and expect everything to work out perfectly in a foreign country with no solid plan steady income or anything else to speak of. Exactly. I agree that this show could easily pull of Rachel and Dev getting back together. And frankly I dont care either way if they did. Thats what I think this show does so well. It feels like youre watching people just living so I dont really have any urge to push my own expectations on to them as characters like I would with more unrealistic comedic or drama filled shows. They feel more like real people with real problems rather than characters in a made up world that doesnt operate by the rules we are use to in real life. I dont know if Im explaining myself well...but basically Im more interested in seeing characters grow and find their own path rather than imagining them in a path I like bestI think thats a hallmark of great TV.,MasterofNone,cwygmf6,3,t5_39u76
5658681,0,t3_3slou7,I binged watched the season and I personally enjoyed this episode the most. At  Ive realized my parents arent perfect in the same way that I am not perfect. It took me that long because I think that growing up I thought my parents had it all figured out.But the parts where each of their dad flashed back to their respective childhoods and moments of disappointment hit me right in the feels. It made me reflect on all the times when my own parents might have had similar moments.And thats the beauty of this show the characters are not afraid to be real and vulnerable. We might not always agree with their world view or behavior but they show us their human side flaws and all.,MasterofNone,cwyiiwx,8,t5_39u76
5659873,0,t3_3rro67,I used the scene from when Brad Honeycutt doesnt shake the womens hands to the end of the episode as an example of feminist epistemology in my Philosophy class! It was an excellent example of something called Testimonial Injustice so good infact youd think Ansari and Yang were familiar with it.,MasterofNone,cwynu57,3,t5_39u76

5720870,0,t3_3tdzsq,Im a big fan of Arnold because hes so reminiscent of Tim amp Erics comedic style but I can very much see why his character doesnt appeal to everyone. The whole deadpan almost surrealist shtick does take some getting used to.I also think that Arnolds character is something that developed organically which I think is great. When he was a guest on Marc Marons WTF podcast Eric mentioned his guest spots on a couple of episodes on The Office and that the character he was playing was rigidly written with very little room for improvisation. Arnold very much seems like something that Eric had a lot of fun developing and that Aziz and Alan gave him a long leash to be classic Eric.,MasterofNone,cx68auy,6,t5_39u76

6263854,0,t1_cz19vxr,I agree. I really like this show but its much more for the writing and subject matter. The only acting I find consistently natural is from Noel Wells. Aziz can be good and I think the actress playing Denise improved by the end or just grew on me but really most of the acting averages from pretty bad to passable.,MasterofNone,cz1mp8d,8,t5_39u76
