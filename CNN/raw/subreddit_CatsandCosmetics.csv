2583468,0,t1_cmvq7td,Oh! Its probably your type of oven then. Most box recipes give instructions based on conventional ovens that lack fans. Yours is a convection oven  it cooks foods more efficiently but if you dont modify your temperature andor bake time it tends to produce a different result. This calculator may help you out. I sometimes bake cookies in my toaster oven that has a convection feature and I use something like that as a guideline...but I watch them like a hawk too since Im not used to cooking that way.The type of pan may also have something to do with it  the different shape may affect heat distribution. If you can get an inexpensive cookie sheet I recommend it  theyre useful for so many things other than cookies! D,CatsandCosmetics,cmvsp1l,1,t5_2xzgm
2583540,0,t1_cmvsuph,It depends on the type of cookie but yes usually. My chocolatechip recipe for example looks almost too soft straight from the oven but sets as it cools down  the edge has a light crisp but the center is soft and gooey. I can do that with my conventional oven or the convection fan on my toaster oven.Like most cookies they will probably harden over time as theyre exposed to air  so once theyre cooled put them in a sealed container.

3276315,0,t3_2xgfv8,I just snack. I try to make sure I have semidecent snacks on hand all the time because of days like this. Cheese crackers fruit carrot sticks hummus olives nuts sliced lunch meats tubs or bags of premade salads. I throw it all on a tray and bring it in to the sitting room and just snack away while I lie horizontal in front of the TV.If you want more of a meal then those readytoeat bagged salads and lunch meats are amazing you throw it all in a bowl dash in some vinaigrette and you have a delicious chicken salad! Takes two seconds.My grandmothers ageold tip is of course freezing stuff. She used to make a big stew every month and freeze it in portions. You just microwave up as many portions as you need at a time and eat! ,CatsandCosmetics,cp1q5oo,1,t5_2xzgm

4138641,0,t3_381wuf,I really enjoy my Etude House Face Conditioning primer  it helps even out my skin tone I had crazy blotchy red cheeks before and is moisturizing. I dont know if this is in my head but it also helped me from feeling greasy throughout the day! I worried less because there wasnt a point in the day where Id go hmm... my face feels a bit like its melting  I should go check.Also I LOVE CATBUG! D,CatsandCosmetics,crs0um2,2,t5_2xzgm
4141487,0,t3_3833jk,Technically this FOTD was a couple days ago  hope thats okay! whee!! yay new glasses!I usually keep it simple for work and Im usually too lazypressed for time because Im bad at managing my time. Karaoke time? Of course! Who needs to change out of pajamas?face Innisfree Water Glow BB Cushion specifically made for warmersummer weather very light coverage. This particular compact is meant more for dry skin. I love the feel of this product and it makes me look dewy but since I have combo skin its kind of a fail. My tzone feels kinda slippery throughout the day especially with glasses so I need to powderblot. Otherwise on nonoily parts this works like a dream! I havent tried this yet with my primer but honestly I dont expect to make it better. Comes in a cute compact that you can refill which is a plus. Rimmel Stay Matte Translucent Powder  I love this stuff. Its the only product I repeatedly buy. Sets my makeup and delays that oily feeling. I pat some extra on under my eyes to help stop my eyeliner from smudging. Shiro Potion Blush  one of my favorite blushes because you can apply lightly and has a pretty light gold shimmer D A light hand adds just the barest hint of pinkycoral color so Im not flat and building it up gives a pretty flushed look.eyeslipsbrows Stila Stay All Day Liquid Liner black  My exfavorite liner. This current one is AMAZING and has no problem drawing fine lines and isnt clogged... but I recently purchased this in brown and that pen is a nightmare. It seems to be an issue with newer pens if MUA is anything to go by so I probably wont repurchase. Im thinking of trying Kat Von Ds liner or perhaps going to a KoreanJapanese brand... but Im open to suggestions! Sonia Kashuk Longwear Gel Eyeliner  Its pretty much ass. It smudges a lot unless I set my undereye area with lots of powder. I use it to tightline I think thats the term for using eyeliner in your lashline?. Looking for a better alternative. Hello Waffle Rapunzel eyeshadow  used for my lower lashline for some color though I think its barely noticeable. Blended it a bit with Hello Waffles Maia in the inner corner. Her new formula is excellent and reminds me of Fyrinnaes shadows! Super creamy and chunks together like Fyrinnae. Makes me wish my HW collection wasnt so large because I would totally upgrade it all if it wasnt such a money sink. Blinc Mascara Amplified  new favorite mascara tried it in the Lash Stash kit from Sephora. Applies very well to my lashes and helps hold whatever little curl I can get. Not too wet so my immediate need to blink after applying isnt ruining my look  Annastasia Dip Brow in Dark Brown  Ive learned using a light light hand is really important or else I rock the powerbrow thing and its not good. Applies easily though a bit more fussy than my brow pencil. Lasts all day with or without my setting spray. Yay! Face Shop Lovely MEEX Dessert Lip Balm  Honey  I love honey and Im pretty sure I eat this more than I let it help my chapped lips D Comes in super cute pot with a wand to help apply. Its super slick Im a chronic liprubber so this is ok for me and helps my lips feel less like the Sahara desert when its actually on. I dont think it tops my favorite Bite Beautys Lip Mask but its  of the price... so theres that. Urban Decay AllNighter setting spray  Love how it extends the longevity of my makeup dont love the price. Feels nice when sprayed and doesnt have much of a scent and dries quickly. I can gently blotpat my face and nothing smudges or comes off. Looking for a cheaper alternative if there is one!,CatsandCosmetics,crsciap,3,t5_2xzgm
4338729,0,t1_cse232a,Ew wtf. I dont know what kind of recourse you have  usually here if you raise hell and be like well your freaking post man either made a mistake by marking it delivered when it wasnt made a mistake by delivering it to the wrong address or is a freaking liar. SO FIX IT RAWR. Theyll usually question the postman to find out wtf he did and then they can either retrieve it or they should have to reimburse you in some fashion,CatsandCosmetics,csepddf,1,t5_2xzgm

4489016,0,t3_3ckqrg,More skincare but Clarins Pure Melt Cleansing Gel is the bees knees. Its hella entertaining to use it starts off as a gel then transforms itself into an oil while youre smooshing it about on your face. And then when water is added to rinse it off bam! Its now a milk. Even my hardiest of waterproof mascaraseyeliners are no match for this fucker. Plus its hella hydrating mega dry skin here too c  and leaves your skin feeling all soft and smoooooth. And! You only need a smidge for your entire face so it lasts for ages. Best cleanser evah! ,CatsandCosmetics,cswi3a7,2,t5_2xzgm

5139964,0,t3_3laclj,This week has been interesting. I got a new job a new pair of glasses my first ever its weird to see myself in them and started my second week of classes. I also talked to my program coordinator who suggested I drop the extra gened class I took to fill a gap I had in my schedule and he offered for me to do my field placement with him during that time instead. In his words I was going to send an email out seeing who was interested but if you want it Id take you in a second.  The not as good bits are the migraine I got today from wearing said new glasses. I woke up at  to make it to my am class and the migraine sent me home by . I ran into my afternoon teacher in the hallway and let him know I wouldnt be there for class today. I missed last week as well with an appointment. I got a look and So youre missing two weeks in a row? so I apologized which lead to Dont apologize to me apologize to yourself. I had him for a teacher a while ago and hes always been a condescending jerk who talks about himself excessively so despite being annoyed I brushed it off.Also because I had to cancel my doctors appointment for my job interview on Monday I still havent seen anyone about my heel spur and its still hurting as much as ever. ,CatsandCosmetics,cv5k3k7,1,t5_2xzgm
5216317,0,t3_3mfx5n,Ive been having some weird intense ups and downs in my first week in my new job! everything overall was amazing with the actual job it was a global team meeting for the humanitarian team so it was just amazingly interesting BUT Ive been so tired and running around and spending like I was already paid This means that Im killing it at work but in my personal and financial life things have crashed and burned. It will be fine I need to just take a step back and find balance.A friend who I hadnt seen in three years moved into the house Im living in and a guy in work who I hadnt seen in three years was around for the global team meeting so Ive been drinking and eating WAY more than usual. Last night I went out dancing and had cash stolen and spent a ludicrous amount of money on alcohol so Im probably just not going to drink at ALL for about a month. We came home last night at about am which is the time Ive been getting up for work all week so I had been going for hrs! I am not built for that so just had breakfast today at pm lolIm having some anxiety around the way Ive been spending so I know I need to get a handle on that so thats what Im going to focus on for the next few weeks. I was thinking I might start a goal setting thread again I loved it and miss it.I have a pretty awesome morning routine now though which I might do a scratching post about later  lt,CatsandCosmetics,cverbmr,3,t5_2xzgm
