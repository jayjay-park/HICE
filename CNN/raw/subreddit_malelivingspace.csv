559011,0,t1_cg3t1uk,Now the serious issues are out of the wayGive some thought to settingchanging the color palette of the space. Youve got white everywhere and a black bedframe so neither of those are going anywhere. Take the multicolored quilt and pillow off the bed and see how you like the way it looks. A bit highcontrast right?The checked gray bedspread joins black and white well but what if you added an accent color to the room? A light wood color to offset the clashing black and white. Ikea has thousands of woodtone lamps which could replace that white plastic thing lamp? on the dresser.Then addchange wall hangings to use a primarily light browntanearthtone like the color of old parchment. Bedspread could probably go the same way.I disagree with reorienting the bed to put the foot at the window. Your space is small I assume its a dorm so the bed is the focal point. You dont tuck your most prominent feature away into a corner you display it proudly.Aside from that maybe some chameleon wall sconces high on the cieling. That big cabinet is a little unfortunate but we work with what we have. Could be a good place to stick some art so long as it doesnt show up as busycluttered. Look for big prints of stuff you already like and avoid movie posters that arent undeniable classics. Sequential or serial art pieces would also work so long as three panels and only three are used. Think of it like a blank triptych setting.Not the best example but those retroretouch Star Wars posters might fit the bill. A ver.,malelivingspace,cg3teal,11,t5_2v70p

652587,0,t1_cgefpyr,Ive always wanted to do something like this and your super small living room would be perfectGet a low to the ground TV stand and put the TV in the corner by your bedroom door. Get a nice rug in the middle of the living room and get two to three quality bean bags  something like a love sack  in place of a couch. A couch will eat up all your space and make the living area look even smaller. The advantage of the love sacks is you can store them away when not using them but still basically have a couch when you do need them. Couple that with some fern type plants for added ambiance and some appropriate wall decor and you could have a very chill atmosphere set up. With this set up Id also put a small dining table in the corner of the kitchen so that Id have some place to eat. ,malelivingspace,cgeg66b,1,t5_2v70p

The main problem we can all get behind is wondering how do we choose a rug based on quality criteria and how do we determine a reasonable enough price and level of quality in the wide range between between throw away crap and heirloom?edit What would someone in the know buy? In many industries there is a big difference between what consumers buy and what professionals and knowledgeable people will buy e.g. coffee supplies audio gear and others.

1203385,0,t3_27u060,Sure! Start with area rugs. In your bedroom youll want the rug to add some softness and comfort to the space then in the living room the rug will work to separate the space from the bedroom since those double doors to a lot to pair the two spaces together. Do you have a bed? If not get something that looks pretty good and will match living room furniture well because of those two doors. As for colors stay away from blues and greens since they already painted some parts of the interior for you. Earth Tones and beige will keep the volume down on that paint color. TLDR Get a sofa that matches the bed and area rugs. Worry about the rest later. ,malelivingspace,ci4zz3a,2,t5_2v70p

1337029,0,t3_29cfd9,Some people have suggested an accent wall.  That is a good idea but it could end up making a narrow room look narrower so take care.  I would suggest painting your kitchen back wall maybe the bar too with a warm colour maybe with a stripe  Either paint or some interesting tiles.I like that there is a mirror for extra light but IMO the frame should be plainer and it could be bigger.  Putting a standard lamp near it could be good too.The red lounger is a good addition in terms of colour but it takes up a lot of space and looks a bit isolated there.  I would recommend a rug or a small coffee table there by it to make it a more inviting and useful looking thing perhaps switch places with the cream chair so you could have it under the window as a reading area.  Moving the charcoal sofa so as to delineate the living area from the kitchen bar area might create a more cozy set up.  And scatter cushions or throws are a good idea to bring colours together or add interesting textures.  Or an area rug.Potted plants add green which is something I feel is often neglected.  Green compliments just about any colour.,malelivingspace,cik15me,1,t5_2v70p

1431876,0,t1_civr5fg,I generally agree with you here in that bottle water should in no way be assumed to be better than tap water.What I advocate is using a filter. As pharmaceuticals in water is a known problem it is something that filter manufacturers target and they are indeed set up to filter out.Saying that filter companies dont filter out pharmaceuticals because the FDA does not require them to is a bizarre stance this type of thinking which implies that something must receive a federal seal of approval to be valid is one reason why Im a libertarian. Its like saying your computer will not process floating point values because there is no federal regulatory body that demands it do so.As for your last point. Chlorine is also absorbed through the skin in swimming pools and hot showers thus it is very hard to control or regulate the dose you receive. So I would suggest the precautionary principle and after the chlorine has played its useful function of delivering the water to your house pathogen free filtering as much as possible out. Chlorine itself certainly does no good for the human organism.,malelivingspace,civrgbb,1,t5_2v70p

2304301,0,t3_2lmtjt,I think your room is alright.  I admire how much colour and individuality you have brought into it.If I were to suggest changes it would be the followingI would stop hanging things on the outside of your cupboard doors and on the walls either side of your side window around your desk. It makes the place look a little cluttered because the light hits it and draws your eye.  Perhaps arrange them on one of the other walls instead move your stuff around a bit see if it works better in other positions.  Replace the valet with something more closed in something with doors that hide that you store cleaning products and shoes and jackets in the same place.  Perhaps something that is wooden and painted white to match the cupboards though I can tell you are not afraid of colour so maybe not white would work too.The things you have on the walls are great but how you have displayed them is not perhaps best to their advantage for example on either side of your front window you have two items that work in terms of colour and shape but you have taped one to the wall and framed the other and stuck them on the wall at odd heights.  Perhaps frame the poster in a similar style to the other thing and hang them at the same height.I really like the drinks globe.  You hide the emlec thing and the shirt too low to show them off they compete with the globe.  Pick one and hang it higher or switch walls see if that works better.I rather like the lights they are quirky.  I would get another duvet and some more coordinated bedding so you have bedding enough for yourself and potential guests.  It looks a little messy as it is though I like that it isnt matchymatchy.  ,malelivingspace,clwj0xa,4,t5_2v70p

I would get some shelving to put up on the wall that an hold books and maybe some of your odds and ends. Get some artwork to put on the walls something subtle. Anything really busy and colorful will make your room feel even smaller.  You might want to get a rug if it doesnt get in the way of your chair and any doors.

2785591,0,t3_2ro3ha,People are giving you flack for this but I think its not bad just not finished. Put your speakers up on two shelves on the outside of the poles so they line up with the TV. Then put a wider shelf under your TV if it fits to house your settop boxes. This way the two tall poles have a purpose of being the whole entertainment centre. Then move that triangular table and the desk lamp so the plant has space to breathe around it. You might also want a picture frame hanging in portrait above the TV between the two poles but mounted on the wall so that part of it doesnt look as bare.Remember to hide cables! That smartens any mess of technology up no end. Tuck everything behind the TV so that the only one you see is the power cable going to the wall.If you really need a lamp there go with an uplighter.

At some age it might be a little odd to still have a rooAnd if you live in a big city with steep rent to begin with it becomes a pure matter of utility.  Some  bedroom places only cost about  more than a single but oftentimes you get more for your money with a  bedroom unit perhaps as far as location or amenities are concerned.  As far as what is better I think for most people as long as they can afford it theyre better off having no roommate.  Only in extreme situations regarding budgethaving moved to a new city with no friends  finding an awesome roommate or even better having a friend be your roommate might someone prefer to not live by themselves.

The obvious benefit is that you can bleach it so if something gets on it that you really dont want to stay it can be removed. Bleaching does shorten the life of fabrics though. And dirt dust drool and things of that nature will show on white between washings. Plus white sheets always remind me of hospitals which can be a little ofputting. They look institutional instead of warm. With a white comforter and black bed you have an opportunity to play with color. Imagine bold options like navy blue or red. Or muted subtle options like cream or tan or beige. Or summery colors like muted orange lighter green or light blue. Seasonal bedding definitely is a thing some people do. ,malelivingspace,cqsooql,2,t5_2v70p

5487023,0,t1_cwd0a41,Fair enough.  My trick was to raid the websites of nice museums but to find art that wasnt feminine.  Its cheaper than you think. I would find really large prints too.  Like  x  feet.  The more wall coverage the better. Then I overspent on framing. A good framing shop can do wonders with a nice print.  Ask them to cover the print with protective coating and you can make the print look quite like a photo.   I stuck to masculine stuff such as military land scapes old world villages.  But something with a little color and depth if not a bit dark.  You can even go to art.com.  Get something imaginative as if you have taste if you have to fake it so be it.Let me share a photo in the AM.  It will click when you see what I mean...but point being the biggest cost is the framing....but well worth it and it dazzles a room.,malelivingspace,cwd0neu,4,t5_2v70p

5554703,0,t1_cwllfuj,Adding colour to your room can make it warmer and more welcoming. So like decent coloured curtains maybe a small bean bag some plants a single coloured carpet.  In fact if you can get stackable boxes and put all your loose items in them it makes the room look bigger and neater. It isnt a very big room so Id use neutral colours for the carpet and brighter colours for cushions and bedsheetsLooking forward to seeing your after images,malelivingspace,cwlm0xs,1,t5_2v70p

5630400,0,t3_3s5w39,Id recommend leaving at least two pillows on the bed at all times. Four ideally but it depends on the pillow. Id go with different bedding the grey is kind of dull. You could do the basic white or get a pattern of some sort. Something clean and simple that brightens up the room a bit. Also that light you linked the one on Etsy I dont think it would go with the rest of the room. Its very industrial youd need wooden furniture probably to make it work. The IKEA one is nice though and leaves a lot of money left over. ,malelivingspace,cwv06dg,3,t5_2v70p

7299242,0,t3_4fcvpi,Honestly...?  Pick a corner and a direction.  Lets say the corner with the hanging pots and the trash can.  Fix that.  Then work clockwise meaning once youve got the corner with the pots and trash looking nice move on to the next spot.  Eventually you will work your way around your entire apartment.  Tackle each room that way.For the trash find a way to store that trash can under the sink.  You may need to replace it with a smaller or more narrow trash can.  Mine is a plastic  gallon trash can with lid that fits nicely under the sink.  Id link to it but its old.The pans arent bad but there may be a better looking way to hang them.Seriously...  pick a corner.  Figure out what needs to be replaced and what can be organized better.  Start there.  Later tackle whatever is to the right of that space.  Over time youll work your way around the room.If you try to do everything at once youll end up accomplishing nothing.  Dont get me wrong a cleanup of everything is always a good idea but when it comes to large scale upgrades organization and furnishing its always best to tackle it in chunks.Good luck!,malelivingspace,d27vhap,19,t5_2v70p

7491938,0,t3_4hzsg0,I have one. I built it myself directly into the studs of the walls so there are no legs coming down. I dont consider it childish but I do wish I had a regular bed. Its a pain to get in and out of especially on cold mornings. Its a mild hassle if I want to take any thing to bed with me laptop cup of tea. My girlfriend and I have had sex on it maybe a dozen times in the two years weve had it we prefer just to use the couch for that now. Its sturdy as a rock but it does creak and I just dont want to risk it.But no I dont think of it as childish. It helps considerably that I have high enough ceilings that you can stand up straight underneath the bed and weve set up the room as just a normal sitting room. EDIT albumPlease excuse the poor pictures. The room is small and its tough to get a decent angle. Basically I mounted x boards into the studs themselves and then used joist hangers to suspend x beams the span of the room. I then used x deck wood as the floor of the platform because its more smooth than rough lumber. Not much different from building an outdoor deck. The gaps between the deck boards are so the mattress can breath. Im aware its ugly but it gets the job done. I intended to paint it but life gets in the way and its just not a priority right now. If we stay in the apartment more than another year Id like to sand and stain it. This is where I found the plans.,malelivingspace,d2tsjsa,7,t5_2v70p

7869252,0,t1_d40j5g8,The issue isnt so much with their orientation as it is them being hung too high As it stands theres an oddly large amount of space between your bed and the bottom of the art. It gives the impression that the art is distant from all the other furniture standing alone in a sea of orange. This is heightened by the fact you dont have a frameheadboard which makes the distance seem greater. Moving them down a few inches would let them interact with the rest of your room a bit more. Its quite possible the pieces outside your room would look better lower as well. them being too crowded Finding the right sized art is important as a piece thats too big will overwhelm your wall and likewise to the contrary. A general guideline is that the art should take up  to  of the available space with  being a popular recommendation. Your art pieces take up probably  of the length of that wall. Its made more noticeable because your art area is wider than the bed the central piece of the room which gives an odd proportion to the view.I hope this doesnt come off as hypercriticizing!

8572736,0,t3_4x3faj,My MIL has always described herself as a minimalist but her house is definitely decorated in the maximalist style.  Her house is super cool tons of artwork and trinkets from their travels around the world.  Furniture pieces theyve had for decades that kind of stuff.  My wife on the other hand is a true minimalist.  I wanted to get some artwork for the bedroom and she asked why?  I like the wall color fine.  To me both aesthetics are equally difficult to pull off effectively.  The maximalist look needs to have personality and character.  Everything should tell a story and hopefully thats a story people want to hear.  I think the examples in here tend to show rooms that are cohesive.  It also needs to be clean.  Dusty shit is just ugly.  On the other hand the minimalist style is hard to pull off because it puts a lot of emphasis on the few things that are there.  And if those few things include poor quality or bad workmanship that stands out.  A good example of this would be a minimalist style home with no baseboards.  To do that you need to have high quality construction with well cut well hung walls and perfectly laid flooring.  because of whats not there any imperfections that are there draw the eye and stand out.

8717060,0,t1_d6v1bsw,agree on most things you say except for all the plants... inside plants are at least as overrated as Steve Jobs is. in my opinion plants belong outside. i would rather invest in more art for the walls and multiple elegantdecorativeinteresting lamps to put in different spots of the room to be able to create different sorts of lightingmoods. but thats just like my opinion manalso just a general question  why do so many people sit that far away from their TVs? from that distance you could literally hold a smartphone at arms length in front of you and the screen would appear to be bigger than the TV.,malelivingspace,d6v9saz,-8,t5_2v70p

Get a double curtain rod get some reddish brown or even off white sheer curtains and then get some drapes with weight to put in front.  Ikea has dirt cheap curtain rod set ups.The sheers would be nice in a layered look as a grand window like that with all that light isnt something you want to block out. However you do need some privacy from across the road. Keep the sheers just more toned to the main color of your furniture. Add heavy drapes in a richer tone that compliments the room in front.

I dont have a full size fridge sink doesnt have a contained drainage basin hence the countertop drainer which I store away underneath when not in use.  I dont think there is an effective way to photograph the kitchen or the bathroom though just due to the lack of natural light over in that corner of the apartment not to mention how small it is.

10413273,0,t1_dcnw0v7,Youre post is awesome! Thank you for taking the time to help out and the images really help to visualize how much better things could look with minimal effort.Kitchen I totally agree with everything you said. One thing I noticed is that you removed the trashrecycling bins. Do you think a sleek black bin which combines the two would work in place of where I had the two small white ones? Otherwise Id need to work out how to add sliding bins under the sink but that would be a pain to have to open the cabinet slide out the bin and open the bin lid every time I throw something outrecycle it. Living room I also like what youve suggested here. My only qualm with painting the wall back to the beige is that A I really dont like beige very much because it feels so bland as opposed to white which feels crisp and clean and B I feel that the room would need much more color elsewhere to compensate for the loss of color on the wall.Also for lighting the living room is great during the day but at night there is no light in there except what comes from the kitchenhall area so I really need something in that corner above the desk. Were you suggesting a different style hanging light or perhaps a floor lamp?Do you think white pillow cases would work or would that be weird because nothing else in the room is white? I dont want the new cases to be the same as the beige walls but perhaps a light grey? Or a bright accent color?My wife loves that deer head despite being very cliche but I like the idea of fewer large prints. Only thing is most art in Scandinavian inspired homes seems to be very whiteblack as well so Im not sure where the pops of color will come from if not the art.Bedroom Ill probably start off with a light grey or white duvet cover and then see where that takes me...,malelivingspace,dcoeuqt,2,t5_2v70p
10428333,0,t1_dcpn5t0,also adding on to  your curtains should be wide enough that if theyre fully extended they actually go to or past the edge of the window looks pretty poorly done if theyre inside the window frame. most are  wide per panel for standard drapes so id look into finding ones that fit your window properly. will look much more polished. once you can do that you can also get some holdbacks or tiebacks to make them look better when opened as well. id maybe try to find panels with a small bit of pattern to them unless you plan on adding more interesting decorative wall elements since right now your room is pretty bland with a ton of beigewhite.,malelivingspace,dcq4cap,1,t5_2v70p

11192449,0,t1_df0kz2z,I did the Math for my current salary.At the same tax rate for the median wage applied to my current wage  which is a little lower I would have roughly  less per month after taxes.My job pays my health insurance so thats a nonissue in this comparison. However I pay  in school loan repayments per month. So thatd come up  ahead for Norway.I do imagine the cost of rental would offset that or more and Id likely lose the freedom gained from owning a car depending on the price of used vehicles there and the cost of ownership but also another  monthly saved as a result of not having auto insurance in this case.I think Id probably come out of it a LITTLE worse off financially compared to my current state if all else were equal except that I would gain better protection in catastrophic life events and dont have a copay even if I have insurance in general for standard things.Norway and similar countries have higher taxes but also a high standard of living and seemingly similar if not slightly higher level of disposable income that in many ways will offset some of the higher priced goods and services.

11358756,0,t1_dfjbzmp,thanks for the response. So the stuff I saw was the roll out stuff I posted a link above it. The only question I had about the plastic pieces is can they be cut to fit the perimeter of my balcony. Plus its super tiny so I dont know if a company would even be interested in do that. Not sure if you can find those sorts of pieces in a store here in the US,malelivingspace,dfjhstd,3,t5_2v70p

11607183,0,t3_64uk2o,I can show you my dorm but there really isnt too much that you can do. Most of the furniture is going to be stock and the rooms arent big enough for a fixed recliner or sofa. Get some comfortable foldable chairs a sturdy stand for a T.V. and go all out on posters. Get some nice frames with mattes. Maybe a plant. Buy some surge protectors and extension cords. Invest in comfortable ear plugs if youre a light sleeper like me because the walls arent thick. Get a set of matching towels. Talk to your roommates about who is bringing what for the kitchencommon area. Buy your own dishes so you dont have to worry about your roommates not doing them. Electric kettles are a lifesaver when youre trying to make ramen. Dont cheap out on the bedding. Get a comfortable set of sheets and buy a good memory foam mattress. Your back will thank you later. If you have any other questions you can totally ask me. ,malelivingspace,dgbomvy,1,t5_2v70p
