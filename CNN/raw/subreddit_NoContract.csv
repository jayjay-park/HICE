670224,0,t1_cggfla4,It depends alot on your usage since theres no Unlimited option.  Under Verizon I was paying   tax for two smartphones one unlimited data and one GB data.  But combined we rarely used more than GB of data and usually less than  minutes of talk time.  Text is another issue.  On our first month with Ting our bill was   tax with just over GB of data used between us.If youre using your phone as a mobile hotspot because you have unlimited data and youre torrenting movies off of it yeah its probably not for you.  If youre a power broker or real estate agent and youre on the phone  minutes out of every hour it might not work out well.Its not like Ting is hiding anything.  They even have a web page where you can see if its right for you where you input the minutes text and data you normally use and theyll calculate your likely monthly bill.The thing I like about it is that I pay for what I use I dont pay for more than I use.  With the contract plans its like ordering a large steak dinner and all the fixings every time you go. But you pay for the steak and all the fixings every time.  And if you want a salad with that you have to pay extra. With Ting I go I order what I want to eat and I pay for what I ate.  No more no less.  Thats straightforward and honest pricing and I think people appreciate that  EVEN IF TING DOESNT NECESSARILY WORK FOR THEM.,NoContract,cgggcb1,3,t5_2xq7c

I did average out my data  voice  msg usage for the last  months and from what it looks like per the ting rate page I use  minutes  messages and  data so I would be around  per month per their rates. If I went with Ting Im probably going to buy a Nexus . Republic looks like it would be my best bet in comparison because their highest plan is  and the Moto X is a very nice phone also. I would probably save the most money with republic but its tempting to go to Ting for the Nexus. However from past experience I wont end up using the device to its full potential and it would probably be a waste of money for me.,NoContract,cgzx335,1,t5_2xq7c

This artificially limited the supply since the OEM didnt have the capacity to meet a higher demand.There hasnt been a followup yet so most users probably still have theirs. So there are fewer used units for sale. Simple low supply and relatively high demand at work there.Its also the first of its product line. Think about the main flagships for other OEMs. When the one comes out the price of the old one falls due to the decrease in relative perceived value. If we had a OnePlus Two Three Four etc each new version would bump down the price of the old one.

4258552,0,t1_cs4nk9c,The karmas not Karma Go are working fine.  But they quit selling those months ago.  The Karma Go is their current product.  They announced a product for G LTE ready in July  but that didnt materialize.  Thats not the problem lots of businesses miss projections for when a new product will be released.  The issue STARTED in September when they took preorders last for delivery around thanksgivingshortly after black friday and advertised it as in time for Christmas.  On Nov   I remember because it was my birthday they announced they ran into an issue and needed to push back shipment to early  which most people took to mean January.In January they annouced the new ship date to be April th .  This one was an issue because they admitted they still needed certification and admitted they knew certification from the FCC was a process that took monthsthis is when people first started to figure out they were lying to customers and there was a high chance of this being vaporware.On March th they announced that they had to push back to May didnt specify date.On May th they announced theyll miss May and went back to no ship date availableIts a great concept but there are a lot of problems with their company.  I dont have a horse in this race so I would like to think Im objective but a lot of people around the interwebz seem to follow around those of us who question whether Karma will survive. I think that at best they are an inexperienced company who took on more than they could chew.  And rather than admit that they started to bend the truth until eventually they got caught in it.  At worst they are a dishonest company that needed investment money to get their product off the ground. I do think the former is more likely than the latter as they are giving out free data to customers who are complaining about the wait and anyone who asks for a refund on their preorder gets one within  hours.  Of course getting free data only helps you if you have the older device so anyone without a device doesnt see the benefits from that immediately. A lot of people are like me and wary to sign onto them even once they get this thing shipped assuming it does ever ship.  I would want to see them in business at least a year or two after this debacle before I put money into a product and even more money into data that never expires only to have them fold a few months after I make that investment. There is a problem with their disruptive innovation which is that if it really becomes disruptive enough any carrier can copy their business plan without hardly any capital investment.  If for some reason they launch tomorrow and get  million subscribers TMobileSprintATampT could announce that they are offering the same thing and put very little investment into the concept as compared to Karma.  TMobile would actually have the easiest time with it IMO as they are setup with the prepaid data packs.  Instead of making them expire after   or  days they could just set them to never expire.All of which means Karma now needs to thread the needle between being not popular enough that they fold because people are wary of them now and being too popular that all the other carriers want to copy them.,NoContract,cs5nnx5,2,t5_2xq7c

Once its done the phone will essentially become either a U version or ATampT version official updates will be received like they would normally be received SamsungAndroid Pay will work etc.IIRC GoPhone doesnt require IMEI whitelisting to get LTE like regular ATampT Postpaid does so you shouldnt need to give them a fake IMEI in order to get LTE.

10571007,0,t3_5r8q0i,In both cases I would say no. Boost because due to network quality and restrictions on what phones you can use there are just better options. Boost markets to the younger crowd and all you end up paying is their marketing budget.Straight talk is fine but they just resell networks on behalf of a Mexican billionaire from what I understand. More competitive than Boost but you have to deal with crappier customer service.All of the major networks offer a competitively priced network with less of a middle man. Verizon prepaid Cricket Wireless ATT and even republic wireless are better options. Think of the networks as utilities they control the same lines they just want to price discriminate for each audience.

10632193,0,t1_ddcl6xn,Its not great but I only use FP as a backup service.  FPs GSM HSPA service not sure about their ATampT LTE service has high latency because its partner is Fogg Mobile who has a US partnership with TMobile and ATampT in the UK.  It pings servers in the UK so Google Voice thinks my phone for FP is in the UK so I cant use it for free calls in the US.  Calls are ok but texts are instant from my perspective on both ends.,NoContract,ddcmoun,1,t5_2xq7c
10636310,0,t1_ddcsb3c,Ultra had a  fee when adding funds to your account which could be minimized by topping up with codes sufficient to fund multiple months of service.  No other fees IIRC.Not sure if mint follows that model or not but there is a definite sweet spot ranking of  months or  months with mint right now.edit  Its funny how people have such different perspectives on data.  Im one of those people who was slow to adopt a smart phone and had payasyougo plans with HO paying . per mb and then PTel . per mb was wonderful.  It was fine since I spent much of my time in a wifi environment.  Ultra mobile plans with  mb were sufficient for me since I didnt stream and had all my phones apps set to wifi only.  My usage patterns make me extremely comfortable with  mb.  Im just one of those people that wants a low recurring bill and even MVNOs arent putting out new sub plans that interest people like me.,NoContract,ddd1y7n,1,t5_2xq7c
