Im in WA and weirdly enough there is a bowhunters course online Ive been looking into but I have to take the regular rifle course to get a hunting license here.

4413909,0,t3_39nxlk,I cant see why anyone would want to put a whisker bisquit on a highly engineered compound bow.  In my experience the bottom whiskers that support your arrow eventually sag or loose their rigidity.  Eventually changing the angle of your arrow on release. You wont find many serious hunters or d shooters using a buisquit. If you just need something cheap to get shooting thatd one thing but its just hard for me to take that rest seriously.  The QAD is a full capture rest and in my experience its one of if not the best  rest you can put on your hunting bow.  ,bowhunting,csn6ko8,1,t5_2stpz
4881061,0,t3_3hqq32,When I was a kid I had a compound with no sights for a while. It just takes practice. Sights are easier to pick up and be accurate just before the season.

9546433,0,t3_5bh71s,Dont hunt or go near your best food source stands until the ultimate times to hunt them.  Everytime you go to a stand you leave residual scent whether youre spotted by deer or not.  The more you hunt a stand the fewer deer you will see.  Deer pattern us better than we EVER pattern them.  However I will hunt the same pinch point stands over and over during the rut because Im hunting cruising bucks that havent been educated about that particular location.  It is SO easy to over hunt your spots and the majority of hunters ruin their spots before the rut is hot and the mature deer are even out in the daylight.,bowhunting,d9psmq7,3,t5_2stpz

9853924,0,t1_darxv55,Yes.  only. If you search theres a guy with a full set for cheaper still.If youre legit . Id get the  to put you at  and the loop can get you the extra half.Theres a screw or  holding it on.Take that one off and put the new one on. Thats about it.This is assuming the string length is still true though which is highly doubtful on a single cam that old.If you can find a bow press....Take all the pressure off the limbs.Take PICTURES OF THE STRING ON THE CAMS AND CONNECTORS than take the short one off and measure it.Its longer than its supposed to be I promise they stretch. Twist it till its the length noted on the chart and put it back on.Do the same with the longer one.Swap the module while Its loose.Reattach limbs tie a new string loop the old will be off now and sight it in.,bowhunting,darzm3m,1,t5_2stpz

10067024,0,t3_5jrcdm,Everywhere is different even down to properties next to each other. Best way to learn is common sense and get out there an observe. I assume you are hunting deer and they can be predictable and unpredictable. Sometimes deer will come from exactly where they shouldnt come from. Know that wind will blow any sent with it and even the best cover sent will not mask all of your odors. They dont see very well so break up your clothing with some sort of camo.  Look for game trails and food sources. If you jump a deer at any time make a note of the bedding area. Other than that go sit with a bow and watch and listen. I enjoy just being in the woods you never know what you will see.If you shoot a deer wait for an hour with a good shot more with a bad shot then go find it. Dress it whatever way you can. Just know that organs inside need to come out. Be safe and have fun! Edit guess you were specifically asking for resources not tips. Most areas will have an organization directly related to bowhunting. Visit ourdoor related trade shows and ask around. ,bowhunting,dbjr8jl,1,t5_2stpz
10243550,0,t1_dc4kgqr,fuck that. if you have a cableas or bass pro theyll teach you for free.Never try and pull the string back with fingers. you can deglove your fingerhand if it gets caught and you lose the string.Make sure for your crossbow is on FIRE it will not lock back with it being on safe. put both hooks facing downwards on either side of the slide. bring the rope between the hooks back into the groove on the backside of the stock itll be right behind where your safety is. The Jackel might be all the way on the back. put the rope in that groove. Make sure the ropes do not cross eachother.put your foot in the stirup and lift it with your legs. If the rope is too long ease it forward and retie the knots going into the handles. I was a bow technician for several years if you have any questions feel free to ask. There are plenty of youtube videos too.Make sure the slide is lubed up and it doesnt hurt to put some on the serving in the middle of the string its the thicker part in the middle and typically a different color.,bowhunting,dc55vyl,1,t5_2stpz
10251707,0,t1_dc62j37,Yeah I dont want to drive myself nuts changing my sights the whole time I shoot every time for the reasons you stated.

Ive bought two bows from members and went through PayPal and I didnt have any issues. One thing I can tell you is if its way too good of a deal then be weary of the seller. Good luck in finding a good deal this is the best time to buy a bow and get comfortable with it before bow season.,bowhunting,dgmdeux,2,t5_2stpz
