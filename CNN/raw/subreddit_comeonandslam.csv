2851139,0,t1_cnrw031,Analysis quick MS Paint jobHere I threw together an analysis to address your concerns. First Im not entirely sure what you mean by match up. As you can see in the picture the downbeats line up pretty much perfectly. You may be getting thrown off by the heavy swing of the Pinky and the Brain theme whereas the Space Jam theme has very straight rhythms.Also I did not just throw both songs together. The introductory sections of the Space Jam theme line up with the first verse and bridge of the Pinky and the Brain theme and the verse of the Space Jam theme lines up with the second verse of the Pinky and the Brain theme. I specifically put in filler drums to line up the phrases that way.I do not typically like putting verses on top of each other but in this case the Pinky and the Brain theme only has a fourmeasure bridge. Sticking only part of a stanza of the verse in there would sound weird so I compromised and put the verse in with the second verse of the Pinky and the Brain theme.Overall my choices were limited by the short length and simplicity of the Pinky and the Brain theme. It is not a very interesting song on its own so I could only do so much with a slam jam remix of it. If you want to blame me for picking a boring song go ahead but I tried my best to make it more interesting with edits.Edit fourmeasure bridge not two,comeonandslam,cns6ado,2,t5_2sv9h

Obviously the  section is the most difficult part of the song and its not perfect but theres some good stuff in there.One thing Ive learned from working with  slamming is that it tends to work better if you use the first three beats of each measure from Space Jam. Also the echo effect you seemed to be going for would probably sound better if you played around with the volume mixing a bit.,comeonandslam,d0b4phv,7,t5_2sv9h
