10596765,0,t1_dd8yqfw,Ive seen several people discussing the fact that there were several people involved with the protests who were wearing all black and covered their faces with masks. These are the people who allegedly performed all of the violent and riotous acts during the protests. Its possible that these people are misguided liberals who dont understand that they are causing damage to their own movement and not furthering their goals. Its also possible that these are saboteurs and outsiders who are intentionally sowing chaos and destruction to make liberals look bad. In either case protesters and organizers need to become more proactive about regulating this behavior. If we allow a protest to be subverted into a riot then the police are going to be the ones to regulate protester behavior.,esist,dd8z3on,0,t5_3irqb

10775070,0,t3_5u2vde,well the GOP is consistent.  Theyve shown nothing but contempt for democratic principles for years.  Its one thing to be the loyal opposition when you arent in power another to simply dig in your heals at everything the party in power proposes even when they like they did for healthcare propose something that was basically your own plan.  Or preventing any infrastructure spending in a recession when the country is desperately in need of better infrastructure.  Or defaulting on the debt.  Or not allowing even a hearing for a scotus nominee.Then of course theres their support for Trump a person they knew was manifestly incompetent and illsuited to say the least to be President.  But as always the GOP wanted power over everything so they went along.And so now here we are where this abandonment of democratic principles to maintain power is the standard for the GOP.

IMO war should be avoided at all costs but there are lots of people on both sides of the isle that would welcome a war because it means more jobs for their districts. Plus it lets them look tough. But what I dont understand is that the most likely opponent in the next war would be Russia but Trump seems to be trying to avoid a war with Russia while everyone else including Putin  is trying to do everything they can to incite one. So do we want to start a war with Russia or not? Or is it possible to stop all this xenophobia and realize there are good and bad people in every nation?

The single person in his twenties making  a year who was able to buy luxuries like health insurance and maybe an iPhone now only has  remaining.  Unless he lives in a high cost of living city he wont starve but he will not contribute much to the economy.  People who make less than he does which is most people hurt more.  On the flip side if someone makes  per year they will bitch and moan about the tax increase but will probably squeak by with the  they have left over.We ask the masses of people who make less to pay less because they are the real engines of the economy and we want to keep them spending.  And of those who make very little money they simply cannot afford to hand over much in tax.So it doesnt have much to do with whats fair.  It has to do with what works.

11231358,0,t1_df4v4rk,Thats true but we have to remember that these people dont have many means to get a higher income. Strikes with protection from the state are a very important part in the fight against income inequality. Example A week ago Berlin Air employees went on a strike leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled. They were not fired in Europe it costs money to fire someone and it must be with a real reason. As of now they have already been given a pay raise of  cents an hour but their demand is  an hour more. Their union and the airport employers are negotiating. Where will that pay raise come from? From people higher up unnecessary purchasesinefficiency and money for shareholders. Who profits? The poor from money that wouldve otherwise gone to the top .In the US I believe such a strike would be impossible. That causes more inequality and that causes more populism.,esist,df525et,2,t5_3irqb

Maintenance is far cheaper on them and there isnt a need to supply fuel. Solar panels are costing less and less to manufacture every year. There are many places already where renewable is cheaper than fossil fuels. Were we to develop wind and solar farms as well as placing solar on more homes and commercial buildings we could eventually eliminate the need for fossil fuels. With the cost of energy storage coming down it is very likely we will have it figured out as long as people dont fight it. Until then I am more than happy to use nuclear energy as its as close to free as it gets without being renewable.

11450739,0,t1_dftwps7,gt Sure. In lots of solidly red districts the local Democrat is just an emptyheaded ambulance chaser or local business owner who is running to get his name out there. Theyre using party funds as a way to market themselves or satisfy their vanity and dont actually give a shit about winning or advancing a policyfocused narrative. Often they will parrot the Republican talking points and will just be a little more bland about it. People would do a lot better in those situations if they could focus on giving moderate Republicans enough steam to compete with the fundamentalist whackadoos. Liberal policies are already a nonstarter so they might as well be strategic and minimize the harm.This is why Republicans do better than Dems. Republicans are more single issue voters  they wont cross party lines as a result. gtThis is where closed primaries really hurt. Many people would like to be able to moderate the Republican slate where they live so their school board can be run by a Chamber of Commerce Republican who may be a callous asshole but can at least competently manage some staff and wont try to sneak intelligentdesign bullshit into the curriculum. But doing that makes you relinquish your ability to have a say on your Congressional Senate and Presidential candidates as a Democrat.Closed primaries also means you keep outsiders away that are just trying to influence the party with no good in mind. Like a Republican voting in the Dem primaries. ,esist,dftxkcw,1,t5_3irqb

11506105,0,t1_dg053nj,Right. Way more corrupt than the side who lied about chemical weapons and invade the wrong country. Saddam didnt do . That country had nothing to do with . But the public and our loved ones where lied to so they could to die in a country that didnt even do . That must have been awesome for those service men and women who literally only signed up because they saw  on tv. But republicans and the bush administration lied and let out loved ones die over oil. But nope its those damn dems who wouldnt let Bernie run who are truly the crooked ones fucking up this country. Not the party who created a cluster duck in the Middle East by invading the wrong country. Not the party who left the Middle East so unstable it gave rise to Isis. I forgot about all that. Oh and should I mention stuff like how republicans got caught in the court of laws restricting black votes down south? Remember that? Remember when the republicans restricted black votes by closing DMVs in inner cities. Maybe Bernie would have been the nominee if people in the south could have actually voted. But nope the crooked DNC stopped them from voting.... Oh wait that was republicans. What is utterly naive is your logic. One party fights to help America get better by stopping oil helping the environment giving health care to people etc. the republican politicians are the ones who get paid under the table to stop these actions from happening. Obamacare has high premiums because of over  revisions by republicans who insisted big insurance stay involved something Obama said he didnt want. those  revisions by all republicans can be traced back as to why premiums are so high. Then you naive people voted trump thinking he would fix those issues. Nope instead he is just going to do what republicans wanted to do all along. Which was not insure anyone. Lets look at oil. Like I said bush started a war over it that had nothing to do with  and was started on a lie. I would say all the men and women who have died or lost limbs going after saddam outweigh the few lost in Benghazi. One was a lie to start a war. One was an attack that was so quick US had little time to react. Both are ducked up but one is clearly way worse. Dying over oil trumps dying over protecting Americans. One is far worse. Secondly which politicians are being paid millions by oil companies to deny scientist and do stuff like continue the pipeline something trump has investments in e.g. Huge conflict of interest. seriously you people are utterly pathetic thinking the DNC is bad because of Bernie but yet you ignore all the shit your party does daily.  ,esist,dg07up4,3,t5_3irqb

11506673,0,t1_dg02pzd,The first link just outlines the jan  press conference where he announced the plan and posed with all those blank sheets of paper.    As the Atlantic says though    President Donald Trump still has not taken the necessary steps to distance himself from his businesses while in office. In accordance with a plan that he and one of his lawyers Sheri Dillon laid out at a press conference on January  Trump has filed paperwork to remove himself from the daytoday operation of his eponymous organization. However numerous ethics experts have voiced strenuous objections to the plan which they say does very little to resolve the issue As long as Trump continues to profit from his business empirewhich he does whether or not he is nominally in chargethey say the possibility that outside actors will attempt to affect his policies by plumping up his pocketbook will remain very much in play.       And the second link doesnt really say anything of substance. It gives info on the emoluments clause then it says no ones proven Trumps in violation yet duh then it goes into a weird thing about how this is the progressives virtue signaling.

Im not saying they werent I just highly doubt it. To me the only sane respectable person in the family is Ivanka.But I do feel especially bad for Barron.

Im far from an expert on the subject but to simplify it what he did was neuter powers of the other branches of government and give those powers to himself.Whats going on here in America isnt really a republican thing well it is in the way that all the people involved are republican but its a bit more complicated than that. Basically what Trumps doing is dismantling federal agencies not to give himself the power but because he thinks theyre a waste or he and his hyenas can get rich by doing so. Again vastly oversimplified but thats the general idea.And if youre talking about the republican party in general its not about consolidating power its about giving more power to the individual states.

The only thing available is to decide if Trump is compromised and if he is compromised than impeach and and impeachment was written into law by the same people that said For the love of all that is holy dont have political parties because party over country wont allow impeachment to happen.Besides foreign powers compromising is a very tricky situation.  If foreign power did a thing to help a candidate would invalidate that Candidate then every foreign power would have an easy way to fuck up the US electoral system forever by helping BOTH candidates and then releasing the information on whoever won.The question isnt Did Russia help Trump which is most assuredly true but Does Trump owe Russia anything? which is a little harder to prove.

Corporations are made up of people and as more and more people esp. highlevel women within these corporations get fed up with this type of behavior being allowed internal struggles develop that contribute to these decisions. Look they already lost their rising star Megan Kelly over this garbage.

Or are you perfectly ok storming every muslim home and shooting them in front of their kids?Where do I defend evil behavior?gtThe goals of the far right are to get Islam to reform like nearly every other mainstream religion to something not incredibly oppressive and violent.Gotcha.  So force every single muslim to convert to a republican approved version of islam.  I may not agree with islam but Im also not stupid enough to think anything like this would work.gtanyone that disagrees with me is literally Hitler argument.Show me where I said thatgtPeople like you defending antihuman rights ideals and a violent culture are an obstacle of progress ironically.Show me where I defend anything of the sort.  If anything Im offering up the idea that how we are going about fixing this issue is the wrong way and will only ever lead to a problem like we STILL have with nazis.  We rounded up nazis after WW put them on trial sentences lots to death.  The ones that would assimilate were allowed to if they were not guilty of murder etc.  Why do we still have nazis?The fact that you can jump to such radicalism says a lot about you.

11762106,0,t1_dgs24zv,Yeah basically what I ended up concluding is that Trump voters lack empathy. You can dance around it and try and find other stats and deep explanations but IMO that is really all it comes down to. You cannot have sincerely considered what it feels like to be in one of the groups Trump targeted and still support him. You just cant.Thats why there have been so many articles from liberal outlets calling for Dems to be nice to Trump voters. Sure but gimme a call when Fox News publishes that story about being nicer to black women or undocumented children. Empathy doesnt really work as a oneway street. Oh and the whole bubble argument too. Yeah ok my bubble of working with refugees in South Africa and teaching English in China is comparable to their bubbles of living their entire lives in a town of  in Arkansas.
