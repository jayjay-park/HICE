936260,0,t1_cha78li,Thats a great point!  The game uses the mouse to drag and drop the broccoli into the bins but this would definitely be better with touch controls.  I think if I hone my d art skills I may consider publishing this as an Android app ,TheArbitraryGamejam,chaphx1,3,t5_30xof
951102,0,t1_chccenj,I did have it originally where a kid used all their moves than the moms moved and then the next kid and so on but it was too easy. I have only gotten past the second yard once myself. I need to adjust or remove a patrol or two in that yard I feel.I also have been toying with the idea of adding fat and skinny moms as well to give them the  moves a turn.I will post a xcom style turn system tomorrow so every one can compare the two.,TheArbitraryGamejam,chcech1,2,t5_30xof
