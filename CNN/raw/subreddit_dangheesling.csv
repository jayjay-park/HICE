127229,0,t3_1vjowv,Did you download the technic launcher from the link that was including in the twitch message? You need to download that and run that program each time you want to join the server.Make sure you select Hexxit from the list of mods on the left after you opened the program and then hit play. Once you get to the minecraft home screen hit multiplayer and then click the add server button at the bottom. Name the server whatever you want but where it says IP address make sure you type in the IP that was given to you exactly as it appears in the twitch message.After youve done that you should be able to connect to the server,dangheesling,cesx46g,1,t5_2ytwn
