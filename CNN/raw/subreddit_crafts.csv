I recommend a number of facial expressions to give some variety.. Arrange and print on magnetic paper. I got mine from Staples at  sheets . X .. Cut out your shapes.. OPTIONAL Spray modge podge or a spray adhesive on top of the cut out characters. I did this to prevent smudging or peeling and to give the characters a glossy look..

A good starting place is a big box craft store as they have a little bit of everything including books and classes. The only source I have for supplies is two chainmaille groups because my bead store in my area closed. The Ring Lord is one option for chainmaille and supplies and West Coast Chainmail is the other. Ring Lord is in Canada so sometimes their shipping prices make me squeak but theyre a longstanding supplier with a good inventory. West Coast Chainmail is a smaller operation but so far theyve been reliable and their quality is good.

Thats what I do with my stuff like that though I do save a stack of newspapers for emergenciesmaking fires cooking etc.There are lots of other things you can do with leftover newspapers and magazines though.    For example you could do papier mache or make papier mache clay or make paper pulp to use for fancy homemade papers.  Loads of possibilities there.  Here are many more though        You might also be able to donate some of your piles to a local teacher kindergarten to high school for papier mache paper mache clay or specific projects they might do using newspaper or magazines.    One thing that kids really like is rolling newspaper sheets on the diagonal over a dowel securing the end tip with gluestick then using the long newspaper tubes after removing dowels to build freeform or other structures along with masking tape to connect the tubes.Youll be continuing to get newspapers and magazines forever though so only recycling will keep your house from looking like a hoarders unfortunately.

They also sell glitter mod podge! Mod podge will not permanently adhere to the mason jars. You can peel it off after it dries. It wont fall off on its own but if you expect heavy wear and tear be prepared to have to redo the Mason jars. I assume theyll just be sitting on a table so that will be just fine!Another thought if youre putting candles inside do NOT put the mod podge on the inside otherwise Ill probably melt off the Mason jars!,crafts,csfjbgy,2,t5_2r187

5192980,0,t3_3m1xc3,First acrylic paint is a permanent paint so doesnt need sealing to prevent bleeding diluting etc.   You can put a clear finish on top of it if you want though either to add a different surface appearance glossy matte satin or to try to protect it from possible scratching or from coming off if thats an issue.Youll probably want to use a clear finish thats harder than acrylic paint so polyurethane is a good choice the waterbased indoor version is fine.  You could use an epoxy resin which will be almost as tough but its messy to use and more expensive.    Polyurethane is available at any hardware store usually in the aisle with stains and varnishes for bare wood my favorite brand is Varathane now owned by Rustoleum because it has an interpenetrating factor but any will be pretty tough.  Id buy the brushon type myself since sprays go on unevenly and usually need a number of light coats.It can be helpful to apply a clear finish over paints that might come off if they get soaked or are on small areas of large expanses. In those cases the sealer can form a larger area of contact if its applied farther than the edges of the paint or form a mechanical hold if its applied around corners of some kind or even all the way around something.As for using a sealer on the shell itself coconut shell is basically wood and wood is porous. Acrylic paint should bond well to porous surfaces especially the thicker ones that arent too wet so you could just make sure its completely clean and dry then go for it.  You may need two coats to get complete coverage of the color.  You may want to paint the area white first though since the shell is brown.  Acrylic paints are opaque but some of them may require many coats to achieve that.  So just painting the area with white acrylic paint will allow the colors you add later to look more saturated and true and using a white primer like white gesso is even better since thats what its for.  And be sure the shell is clean and dry when you paint.  You can even rough the surface with fine sandpaperetc a bit to give the paint more area to grab or you can do the same thing with clear finish or white acrylic paint probably wouldnt be necessary with the gesso. ,crafts,cvby4q1,1,t5_2r187
