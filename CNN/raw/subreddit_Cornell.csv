I think it was  problems and if you were taking only one exam you had a full two hours whereas people trying to get credit for both had to finish both in that same amount of time. From my personal experience you dont need a certain scores on each individual question. I tried to use a shortcut to basically do no work on the last problem that wasnt applicable and got no points for it but I had gotten all the other problems right so I passedAs for study materials any colleges second semester calculus material should look about the same. If you find a course at another school with comparable material coverage it should also have similar problems. If you have access to a calculus textbook most are pretty much the same. Not sure how helpful it would be but you could even look at the free response sections of the AP calc BC exam for practice. I would say when it comes time to preenroll if by that point you feel like you have a good grasp of the material sign up for MATH  and the physics that you want to take because it will be harder to schedule and switch into an intro level engineering class than with a discussion time and lab that fits your schedule than into another class. ,Cornell,d3oebpf,1,t5_2r0sd

8031634,0,t3_4p84yz,The placement exams are generally final exams from the course that it will place you out of. So the exam will be as difficult as the actual course is.Disclaimer I have not taken the Physics CASE exam.If you are worried about taking EampM during the semester because you found Mechanics difficult youd probably be better off taking the course than placing out. The first reason for this is that the material will likely come up later and youll need to know it on the level taught in the class not on the level that you memorized in two months. The second reason is that if you think you will find the course difficult you likely will not pass the placement exam in the first place.If youre interested in taking the exam you should ask around for  problem sets and past exams to practice on so you know what topics will be covered and what the test format is. ,Cornell,d4itxwh,1,t5_2r0sd

8639585,0,t3_4y4m9p,Math and econ are great at Cornell. I loved my econ program as well as the College of Arts and Sciences CAS. I will say that CAS is very selective in admitting transfer students. Only  of their student body is transfer students and engineering may be even lower in the  range definitely under . For better or worse its difficult to externally transfer into CAS and COE unfortunately. Thats not to say its impossible. I definitely knew transfer students in both of those colleges. However CALS and ILR are  transfer students and they accept a lot more. Also if youre a resident of NY state CALS is only about  of the tuition cost. Unfortunately CALS doesnt really have a math or econ program comparable to CAS. CALS does have Applied Econ and Management which is similar to a financebusiness degree but I think that might be migrating into the College of Business not sure what that process will be like. Theres also biometry and statistics as well as information science. I know of a few people who transferred into Cornell ILRCALS and then completed an internal transfer into CAS because its easier to do that.
