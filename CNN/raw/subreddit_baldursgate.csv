There isnt a way to make the phantom ammunition have any sort of bonuses aside from what it can hit.

They try to give you a this is the point of no return warning as you descend the steps to the tree of life but it can be easy to miss.There are a few solutions but I think the easiest one would be to just teleport to your stronghold grab your stuff and teleport back. I imagine it would work in ToB but Im not sure so to be safe you might want to go now. After activating the CLUA Console select your whole party and use the following commands    CLUAConsole  MoveToAreaARThis should place you right outside the mage stronghold. If youre not a mage you can either hoof it or you can tell me which stronghold you have and Ill give you the area number. Once youre done use     CLUAConsole MoveToAreaARto go back to hell.

2048298,0,t3_2i9md1,Those are legitimate complaints. I think the key is to avoid strategies that you think arent fun. So if you dont like having to cast a bunch of spells to knock down magic resistancesaving throwsspell protections alter your strategy. Physical attacks are limited mostly by PfMW which means a single breach is all you need to immediately have your fighters start working down a protected spellcaster. Your spellcasters can use summons party and self buffs improved haste Tensers transformation champions strength etc. or physical attacks melfs meteors energy blades so they arent just standing around.If you start invisible the enemy mage will waste a round casting true sight giving you extra time to interrupt them before they get their timestop off. If you can open with a poison bleed effect or even a silence or miscast magic you can stop them from casting entirely.Basically there are hundreds of ways to go about each fight so you shouldnt be afraid of trying new things if your current strategy is boring for you.As for ToB youll have a lot of opportunities to use your powerful spells against hordes of weak enemies but there are also more powerful ones that have even more magic immunities than youll find in SoA. If you arent able to find an endgame strategy you like Id recommend trusting your gut and going with Icewind Dale. Or you can try a new character and party and play BG again.,baldursgate,cl06me9,5,t5_2t07j

2973997,0,t3_2u7rg5,Ive played BG quite a lot and I can tell you she is great character if played right. She is a highly versatile party member who can fill a variety of roles in your adventure. As a Druid she has access to many of the most powerful offensive defensive and utility spells Harpers Call Heal Insect Plague Cause Critical Wounds Summon Animal  Summon Fire Elemental are just a few that come to mind So you get all of that with a character who can easily function in a melee. She can wear some of the best medium armors enchanted chain mail typically has access to weapon types that include some of the most powerful weapons in the game staff amp spear is much quicker than most fighters and has utility spells like Iron Skins that give her very high combat survivability. Other perks include her neutral alignment which helps avoid innerparty conflict or her leaving the party her wining personality and insults and her character quest. Yes her quest is a pain in the ass. Yes its confusing and makes her a weakling for a while. Yes it results in several difficult ambush encounters. BUTIts totally worth it. The quest line puts you in combat with several powerful adventuring parties and thus gives you a chance to acquire some very powerful magic items. Some of the best items in the game to be exact and because it is a party you fight youll get something no matter what class you are. Of course best of all the final quest reward is THE most powerful necklace item in the game. It has  distinct enchantments on it and makes her that much more of a badass. The quest also involves a personal interaction with one of the Sword Coasts most legendary denizens.

Did you know that BBoD damages like the flail of ages while simultaneously having an onhit effect on par with Blackrazor?  Did you know all hits during timestop are guaranteed successes if the enemy isnt immune to being struck?Clerics get great damage resistance but Mages can easily avoid all damage.  The PC in particular gets the best exploit of all as PFMW combines with his natural immunity to normal weapons.  But mages can also do things like cast mislead and spell immunity divination and be untargetable except by enemies who see through invisibility.  Clerics get death ward.

There are others and Im sure Im forgetting some that I like myself but these are my favoritesItem Randomizer mods if you played a lot of BG which is the game where items have the greatest impact since theres amazing items then you know where everything is and you will go for the good stuff instantly after starting a new game. This provides a better alternative to highly arbitrary solutions like Im not gonna buy the Robe of Vecna until I reach level  at least or something like that. Its an excellent mod that has plenty of options and smartly randomizes items by rank you wont find an insanely powerful item in an easy to reach place basically hard quests still reward powerful items just not the ones you expect. Every playthrough is a surprise!Icewind Gate  delta version I prefer the nd ed rules but for someone that played a lot of BG its good to have some variety so this mod brings Baldurs Gate  in its entirety I played it myself all the way through though I have yet to test ToB to the Icewind Dale  edish engine. New builds! New enemies! well old enemies with new rules. Iron golems are much harder in rd ed for example New spells! some absent like Time Stop unfortunately. GREAT fun because BGs world is immensely better than Icewind Dale s. The whole thing is much more stable than you might expect! the only little hassle is doing some stuff when you want a new NPC to join your party but you dont constantly change party members and you can also use a full created party with no additional hassleSword Coast Stratagems good mod for a bit more of a challenge. Pretty straightforward! can be a bit frustrating in a few places but nothing majorCustom house rules a great thing about the infinity engine games is that theyre are ridiculously easy to mod in a lot of aspects so you can alter some things you likedont like. I personally play BG with the BardPaladin spell progression of Icewind Dale which means epic  level bardpaladins arent restricted to the same spell levels they had at level . Sure it makes the game easier but it also makes it more fun and you can make the game harder in other ways while still being kind of official Im using the Icewind Dale spell progression after all. I also change the color of armors every once in a while to look cool I made a goodytwoshoes party with everybody wearing golden or silver armors and another time I played a solo demonologist sorcerer I modded the demons to give me xp when they kill someone otherwise I would never level up with a Robe of Vecna modded to be blackred.Finally theres a mod Ive only recently found so I cant give a full recommendation but so far its been pretty good which is called aTweaks whose most interesting part for me is the attempt to make monsters closer to their PnP counterparts. Its good for variety and it can make some monsters extra tough theres an option for demons to be able to gate in other demons for example!.Apart from Icewind Gate  which is technically an IWD mod all those mods work in both the original versions of the game and the enhanced editions if you prefer them.,baldursgate,cw6wzua,10,t5_2t07j

6734623,0,t1_d0fw5s2,Thieves cap out pretty early in how useful their levelups are. Youll have sufficiently high scores in detecting traps and picking locks around level  making that a suitable point to dual into a mage. You want as much time as possible to level up as a mage because theyre pretty linear  basically every levelup gives you additional spell slots until the mids. Also the longer you wait to dual the longer youll be without the abilities of your first class.Now thats how I personally would play a thiefmage. You might have something different in mind and you should play to support that. If you want to play a backstabbing assassin who uses magic to immobilize your foes or teleport behind them you might wait until a higher level to dual and get a bigger backstab multiplier and more points in moving silently or hiding in the shadows.

Good Guys have fighters rangers and paladins. Bad guys originally just had fighters. Beamdog added an evil paladin. If we were to throw in an evil ranger then the bad guys would have an option for all three types.Of course you could just mod away the alignment restriction but if a player rangers reputation drops below a certain number they become a fallen paladin and lose all their ranger abilities which limits what you can actually do in terms of evil.Plus some evil ranger NPCs would be nice since the good guys already have more than they know what to do with.,baldursgate,d3pe7jz,1,t5_2t07j

10208405,0,t1_dbyiz9q,Okay here it is.  Bodhi just happened to be there.  Its never really established what her relationship to Gaelen Bayle is.  Presumably a thrall of some sort or she had the foresight to know Abdel would show up there who knows.  Bodhi and Abdel make the beast with two backs while he is under some sort of hypnotism or thrilling type shindig.  She sucks his blood just to know what the blood of a god tastes like.  ltThis is the main reason she was ever present.  I feel like a secondary reason would be to give the story a little more cohesion.  Without this relationship there would literally be two echospheres of activity that never effect each other until the very end of the story.uFrenchFry,baldursgate,dc16h2j,2,t5_2t07j

10655007,0,t3_5sgzny,I dont think Minsc and Edwin get along at all. Honestly youve got a solid team there nothing to worry about it terms of difficulty. For context I am currently going through the game solo on insane and finding it fairly easy. It all depends on class and spell choices get Breach cast it ??? profit. Out of interest why Kensaimage for a first playthrough? No doubt its a powerful class but with Edwin Im struggling to see a good reason to not choose a more standard physical attacker. Particularly since you already have Victoria and Imoen. Id switch out for an inquisitor or grab Keldorn since you have a space left. Kensaimage are quite boring to play in a full party and dont get powerful until late game when everyone is a beast anyway. Dont worry about powergaming just choose whoever and have fun. Enjoying the NPC conflicts is part of the first time fun. ,baldursgate,ddezd4c,7,t5_2t07j

11333162,0,t3_61pngs,Ive noted some mages have unnaturally low Saving Throws vs Spells for example Torgelias and the Rayic Gerthas making some antiMage spells rather pointless. If all else fails throw weeny summons at them to expend their spells and then rush them down either yourself or just keep throwing stronger summons. You could also try throwing Greater Malison on them to reduce their saves by  but even that wont always cut it.,baldursgate,dfglenj,2,t5_2t07j
11346040,0,t1_dfg2qvc,I second the suggestion that fighterthief sounds more up your alley. Fightermages are great but only IF you are very comfortable with the magic system using it to buff yourself weakendisable your enemies etc... Fighterthieves have a lot going for them and are a lot more fun to play than straight fighters. Hiding in the shadows sneaking up behind an enemy and backstabbing the shit out of them is pretty satisfying... Especially since the fighter side makes you a lot less fragile and actually able to handle the fallout when youre discovered. At higher levels get a decent weapon and watch the meatchunks fly... Youll onehitkill a good portion of enemies in the game. ,baldursgate,dfi1xq0,1,t5_2t07j

11416798,0,t3_62yvcu,Irc Keldorn and viconiaedwin might pose some problem. I think it might be Keldorn and Viconia that will get into a fight. Looking at your party you can use your PC Jaheira andor Viconia as frontliners in a pinch and with the right equipmentspells but if you really want a dedicated fighter Id recommend Korgan. Personally id probably roll a host of semifrontliners and recruit HaerDalis as my sixth for that team but that just because I like the guy.Lets look at the thinkingYou have x divine druid and cleric x arcane and .x thieves Imoen can be a solo thief with good use of pots but counts as . because of no further points given which is a well rounded team but since arcane is the bread and butter of this game youre not worse off adding another arcane caster but its hardly needed. That said a fighterrangerpaladinberserkermonk might round it up quite well as you said.Looking at the rooster available from recruitable npcs from these classesAnomen fighterclericKeldorn Paladin and frankly a great addidition to any nonviconia teamKorgan fighterMazzy fighterMinsc rangerValygar rangerOut of these Keldorn is counted out because of noncompatible with viconia. Ive never ran with Anomen but can imagine he would not fit well with edwinviconia. Minsc and Edwin is also a nono. That leaves Korgan Mazzy and Valygar. Both mazzy and valygar have kits less aligned toward front line leaving Korgan.Ive ran with Korgan a few times for evil parties. He does the job but is nothing special. Viconia kitted out is a decent frontliner. Ive used her for my limited parties  characters along with one arcane and one theif. Ive not tried Jaheira at the frontline but I could see it working with some prebuffingthe right equipment. Your PC might actualy do quite well on the frontline too. Given all these semioptions you can basically pick any sixth baring personal conflicts and the party would work.Just my five cents anyway.,baldursgate,dfq2z9v,2,t5_2t07j
11432934,0,t1_dfqeea1,My install is a fresh one and SCS still has corrupted strings so its not a guarantee. Theyre few and far between though although unfortunately Spell Thrust one of the most key spells in SCS is entirely faulty which is a kind of a bummer.Could be worth it for you either way though. Hope you enjoy the fights! Mage combat in SCS is probably the most fun youll ever have with the game if you enjoy that kind of challenge... until you get HLAs and Robe of Vecna and everything is just toast. ,baldursgate,dfrwtji,1,t5_2t07j

11505324,0,t3_643iaz,Heres the thing. Youre in a world dominated by gods you dont even know existand dont give me that Bhaal crap hes a minor bird in the best of cases.Permadeath can occur due to varying reasons Chunking as uBraymondGreen pointed out. Simply put if there is nothing to resurrect you cant be resurrected unless someone literally pulls your soul from Hell. Gods forbidding it. If Mystraone of the OG gods not like the Helm and Cyrus new age niggas says no a spoon in your eye will kill you permanently. By the end of ToB youve pissed off so many powerful gods it would be odd to not be permad out of spite. Special circumstances. Even if your body is  intact and what killed you was poison designed to kill a baby you can still be permanently dead because guess what DampD doesnt really have surgeons that can put everything back the way it was. You are reliant on gods granting the heal spell and barring point  above your body may not be able to sustain life upon resurrection and thus youre once again the bitch of the underworld. Last but not least your soul needs to be present. DampD usually has a defacto rule that if your soul isnt there you aint getting shit done with your bodybest case scenario zombie. Given thatusually your soul goes off to some random waiting room for trial if youve been damned to some level of hell or heaven you aint getting resurrected no matter what you try.

11727621,0,t1_dgiqmzt,Agreed I really enjoyed Shadowrun Dragonfall PoE etc. A lot of the issues here really boil down to console vs rpg whether they recognize it or not. Why were the KotoR games simplified compared to what their engines predecessor could do? It was designed for consolefirst. Simple.Why did DAO ship with third person view? For consoles. Why were the subsequent games in the franchise streamlined and simplified? EA wanted higher sales on consoles.Why dont you see games like PoE the EEs Shadowrun etc on consoles? The niche is best served on PC. The mechanics and controls are linked and easier to execute with kbm than a controller.So did KotoR represent the dumbing down of RPGs? Not even close. The genre isnt zerosum cRPGs dont have to suffer because of consolefirst designed action RPGs or jRPGs just like theres space for all variety of MMOs or integration of RPG mechanicsprogression in other genres.I can enjoy all different types of RPGs and still find textheavy choiceampconsequence heavy turnbasedpause ones with isometric perspective and thats a good thing.,baldursgate,dgpcu7h,2,t5_2t07j

If ye make me angry Ill bury the head of me axe so far up yer backside yer breath will smell like magic metal!Jan Thats exactly the kind of thing TwinHammers would say. He was a ruthless savage bloodthirsty outlaw who would kill anyone or anything that got in his way. He used to repeatedly terrorize a certain gnomish village he frequently wandered through in his neverending quest for profit and bloodshed.Korgan A man after me own black heart! Carry on gnome ... ye got me blood stirrin!Jan Of course all good things come to an end. Fed up with Uriahs antics the village hired a hero to protect them and enforce the law  the legendary Clint Hackman so named for his habit of chopping his foes to little bits. With the townsfolk peering from their windows the outlaw and the famous lawman stared each other down in the center of the dusty deserted street. Cold as ice Uriah said Ive killed women and children. Ive killed everything that walks or crawls on this earth. And now Im here to kill you. Alas Uriah met his end on that street. With his first blow he broke his hammer on Hackmans shield and that was it. Weaponless he wasnt much of a match for the mighty Clint. If my uncle had only been named TwoHammer because he carried two weapons he still might be alive today. But Uriah got his nickname for the mighty hammer he carried in his belt and the even mightier ... uh hammer he had beneath his belt if you get my drift.
