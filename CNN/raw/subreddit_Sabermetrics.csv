1425851,0,t3_2adpz6,Its an interesting point. xFIP is a better stat than FIP but SIERA is best and values Kennedy over Ross . to .. Kennedy has the edge in strikeouts walks and even ROS projections.So yes Kennedy is more deserving but those stats arent looked at by many voters or players. Ross gets in because of some good defense behind him and elite ground ball rates.,Sabermetrics,civ0a7t,3,t5_2rxl3
1979928,0,t3_2hd1ms,The stat would take pinch hitters into account but there are very few ABs for pinch hitters compared to the rest of every starting lineup especially considering that a lot of starting pitchers will be out of the game by the time pinch hitters come up. Id imagine they wouldnt affect the data very much. I assume its a result of both things but maybe one more than another. Maybe you could isolate pinch hit ABs to see.,Sabermetrics,ckrs688,1,t5_2rxl3
2582074,0,t1_cmvlv6h,Are you sure? I know Dominic Smith had a  wRC despite a . OPS because he played in a park that is death to lefty power hitters whereas Kevin Plawecki had a  wRC despite a . OPS because he plays in an extreme hitters park. I assumed it was.,Sabermetrics,cmvm4nj,2,t5_2rxl3
2587583,0,t1_cms69gx,That is ssn interesting thought I will definitely consider it along with other ideas. Data may be laborious to our together but could be worth it. Thank you,Sabermetrics,cmwc24x,1,t5_2rxl3
3741408,0,t3_339bga,Others on the site have asked but can you recommend a good primer for interpreting pitch fx data on Brooks baseball?Also any early surprising standouts based on that data?EDIT  thank you for stopping by!,Sabermetrics,cqiqtzz,2,t5_2rxl3
5698288,0,t3_3t5v9s,Someone can correct me if I misspeak but wOBA does not factor in BABIP nor does it factor in things like park factors. Personally I prefer using wRC. But either is fine as long as you know what you arearent looking at. ,Sabermetrics,cx3feiy,10,t5_2rxl3
5958490,0,t3_3x13x3,Id say a . BA and a . OBP are about equal so youre probably not far off.,Sabermetrics,cy0ot28,5,t5_2rxl3

8295226,0,t1_d5e8hwj,I think I figured it out.  I had to reimport the Master table into MySQL from CSV and I used R to do it.  Theres probably other ways to do the import Im new to MySQL but the default MySQL Table Data Import Wizard wasnt working.Its actually good to know how to update the Master anyways as it looks like Github updates this CSV file in midseason.,Sabermetrics,d5egn1f,1,t5_2rxl3
10816734,0,t1_ddvhmc5,Thank you for the info! I very much appreciate it. I suppose I just never ventured on over to the Value tab. That and your replies should give me everything I need.,Sabermetrics,ddvo4jc,2,t5_2rxl3
11547771,0,t3_64t80a,BaseRuns arent really a linear concept where you can calculate them at the individual player level and then add them up to get the combined team value.  I mean you can do that but its just using BaseRuns as a type of linear weights and it doesnt retain any of the advantages of using BaseRuns over just using linear weights in the first place which isnt that big a deal unless you need a lot of precision.  Unless you are going to project the expected team totals for each individual stat i.e. add up the total expected PA hits BB HR etc for the lineup and then calculate BaseRuns from that which youd almost certainly have to do yourself given how specific it is youd be just as well off using standard linear weights values like you can find on FanGraphs or BaseballReference.,Sabermetrics,dg4xxrn,1,t5_2rxl3
