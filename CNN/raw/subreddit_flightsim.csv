668386,0,t3_21s33e,The approach on your GPS is not a precision approach. It will only take you over the lateral position over the fixes waypoints. What youre asking is how to execute an ILS landing and to do so you need two things  . An ILScapable aircraft . An ILSequipped runway.In FSX youre shooting an ILS approach youre given vectors to the final leg by default meaning ATC will tell you where to go. When youre being vectored in that is the time you should be setting up the AP to shoot the approach. You need to know  . the runways ILS radio frequency and the ident code . the runways course  . the glidescopes altitude if youre being vectored in you dont need to worry about this as theyll set you up at the right altitudeAfter you have that you would tune the frequency into the Nav  radio and turn on the Nav  radio audio so you can verify youre tuned to the correct station by listening to the morse code on that channel. Then you would set the course to what coincides with the runway. After ATC sets you up on a  degree angle to intercept the glidescope you would activate the NAV button on your AP panel make sure it is set to VLOC and not GPS to line yourself up with the runway. Once youre in line press the APP approach button which is generally next to the NAV button. This will instruct the AP to capture the glidescope and descend the aircraft to MDH minimum decision height generally  ft AGL.For example I intend to shoot the ILS  at CYEG  ATC tells me to expect vectors to runway  ILS  I gather the correct information to shoot the approach ILS freq . heading  ident IFP  Tune the Nav  radio to . set the course on the HSI to  degrees  Verify correct radio station by listening to morse code .. ... .. spells out I F P  ATC sets me up for the intercept descend and maintain  until established on the localizer contact tower on .. I now press the NAV button after ensuring the AP unit is set to VLOC. I also contact tower to get clearance for landing  Aircraft turns to heading . I now press the APP button.  Intercept the glidescope and the aircraft begins to descend. Now is about the time you would lower your gear make sure youve been deploying flaps and adjusting throttle as needed to stay at your best approach speed  ATC Cleared to land  When  feet above the ground disconnect the AP and set throttle to flight idle  Land,flightsim,cgg8tkl,4,t5_2qspy

720781,0,t3_22f6kc,Thats the free TF right?Some notes   Keep the ball centered. It was off center for most of your flight especially during your high power pass over the runway. This is going to slow you down a lot lose energy. Either use rudder trim or the pedals to keep it centered. In general you need way more pedal input compared to the A or the F.   You were at RPM when you reduced manifold pressure all the way back. Its not too bad you can do that but dont do it to often. As long as you reduce MP before you reduce RPM you should be fine for the most part.   Max sustained power setting is  of MP and RPM. Max military power shouldnt be flown for more than min although I have flown at RPM for more than  minutes wo any damge but sometimes the engine breaks after mins.   Engine should be at RPM for landing Manifold pressure as needed.    Have fun flying!

If so youve got a valid usagecase.On the other hand if you simply buzz buildings fly under bridges and try to crash into other planes that would most reasonably be interpreted as Entertainment and would not be a valid usagecase.Very few people who would read this subreddit buy a flightsim product purely for entertainment.   Theyre usually people seriously interested in learning about or simulating the real thing.  If youre in that group youre in.  And even LM has said that its OK to have fun in the sim.

1435203,0,t3_2akhhb,It really depends on what youre looking for.  XPlane is more of a sim in that it does a lot of things more accurately such as flight modeling contoured runways accurate and constantly updated nav data but lacks some immersion factors such as seasonal textures and while the clouds are constantly improving they are still a little lacking.  Fsx on the other hand has an enormous library of addons whereas XP is smaller but growing and with pmdg coming on board has a very promising future.  Be warned a lot of the fsx videos you see on YouTube have a couple hundred dollars worth of addons to make them look so magical.  I used fsx for many years but have switched over to XP full time because its much more stable.  Many people complain about the lack of detailed airports but there is also a massive collection of freeware airports for XP and their world editor is very easy to use.   I populated my local airport with static aircraft and buildings in the span of a morning.  As said already in the comments with XPlane you can download the demo to give it a shot but I must say that with it being very scalable in terms of visuals you need to play around with the settings to find the sweet spot on your machine.  ,flightsim,ciw6gss,2,t5_2qspy

2658257,0,t3_2qdyum,Well first you only have Global installed so it is definitely an improvement over default but there is still room for improvement. I have Global as well as Vector and a couple regional Orbx packs Pacific Northwest and Northern CA. Each one steps up the beauty to another level.Meanwhile with just Global you need to make sure you have it and FSX configured to best show it off. So you should turn off Hybrid mode. You want to only turn it on when you have one of the regional packs installed AND you are going to be doing a flight that takes you across the border between general Global textures and the regional upgrade. If you are only flying in a Global area or only in one of the regional upgraded areas then keep Hybrid off.Hybrid doesnt ruin anything but as the Orbx devs explained it in their forums Hybrid mode changes some of the rules that FSX uses to choose which textures to display for a given landclass type of ground. It makes the ground textures more generalized so you are less likely to notice the boundary between upgraded areas. But that means you dont see as much of the custom textures tuned for realism in the area. Forests may not look quite as similar to what is really in an area and so on.Also you need to make sure you have configured the FSX settings properly. Be sure to read through the user guide that comes with the FTX Global package. They provide recommendations on settings to get the most of the textures and balance against your computers capabilities.,flightsim,cn5kabu,1,t5_2qspy

2963247,0,t3_2u3e24,My opinion here...so just take it or leave it but you can save yourself a lot of money here. Ditch the water cooler. Go grab one of those Hyper  Evo air coolers. Theyre great and youll save .  Ditch the SSD. I dont see FSX benefiting from this. Maybe XPlane will. It depends on how many readwrites per second Xplane perform. For example Arma games are always streaming terrain data little packets of data from the hard drive so an SSD is a huge benefit there. If there arent many reads or writes per second then an SSD wont help you that much performance wise. Itll load up everything quicker but would it be worth the cost? Id go with a GTX  or . FSX likes NVidia better. Plus the power draw is a lot less I think? With lower power draws youre electricity bill will be smaller and you wont need such a hefty power supply. With some of these savings Id go with an Intel I and just overclock the hell out of it.  Performance for each core is lightyears ahead of AMD.

3347231,0,t1_cp9sfze,Extra thought....  Stalls.Throughout private pilot training youll be asked to repeatedly stall aircraft.  Over and over again.  There are a list of reasons for this but after a few hundred hours of flying small planes youll be very familiar with the stall characteristics of an aircraft.Its not something that you can describe.  Its just a pattern of behavior that any aircraft has when flown close to the stall speed of an airfoil.  The only flight simulation Ive ever flown that has come close to modeling stall behavior appropriately is XPlane.  Ive flow a bunch of combat sims over a  year period a couple IFR training simulators  years ago and every Microsoft and sublogic flight sim since  and XPlane.  What sold me on XPlane is the stall behavior.If you havent been in a small plane flying it through a stall and had a wing drop suddenly on you youve missed the fun and the sensation.  I dont know why but I never liked stalls never cared for the sensation of it.  But theres no mistaking the feeling when you let a stall go uncoordinated.Like I said XPlane is the only sim Ive ever tried that modeled the airfoil and felt close to real in a stall.You can get an XPlane model into an honest flat spin as well.  I used to do that all of the time to test the weight and balance of the models I was creating.  Spins flat spins and inverted spins are all about weight and balance and accurate modeling of the airfoils of the lifting surfaces.  XPlane does an good job as a sandbox for testing experimental aircraft designs.,flightsim,cp9t5zz,1,t5_2qspy

3385676,0,t3_2yxofe,I think its brilliant! You really have the potential but maybe just a couple things Id like to point out.First being the cockpit view I think its too far back which is annoyingly uncomfortable and less realistic.Secondly is the shaky effects on EzDok. I think it is as important as the cockpit view. It really makes the videos more suspenseful. So if you can configure your settings maybe turn on the RND and DHM effect it would be nice.Other than that youre good!,flightsim,cpe6zeg,2,t5_2qspy

3518508,0,t1_cpt4fsb,Schedule is pretty much as followsBriefing myself Meteo restrictions mission planning etc.Briefing with partners if we fly cooperative missions with other squadrons or nations we have to prepare that so that everyone is at the same place at the same time tanker rendezvous are prepared everyone has diplomatic clearances for every country...Go to aircraft prepare everything for take off go through mission again to memorize the important aspects.Fly the mission.Return secure the aircraft.Debrief yourself usually very quick unless you had an instructor in the back seatDebrief your partners. Now in big missions this will get quite complex. For example we had a big international training op a few weeks ago and for two hours of flying we were debriefing about six and a half hours. To do the debriefing we use our GPS recording systems and the recordings of our partners simulation of weapon behaviour etc all running in sync in up to ten debriefing facilities. This actually looks pretty cool with all the aircraft being modelled correctly weapons being fired etc. but it really can be a chore. Administrative duties and preparation for the next day.We are working office hours. This has given us some very bad publicity when we were unable to intercept an aircraft and the fench had to do it.From my office to lift off probably about  mins if we are prepared more like  mins.,flightsim,cptc41r,3,t5_2qspy

With the cost of the rental and CFI that should give me plenty of room to spare.Im going to disagree with you a little bit on the maneuvers and landings. You are correct in that the real thing handles very differently than the simulator as far as tactile feedback and control surfaces but a lot of the rest as far as rudder work and maintaining an approach speed is relatively the same. The simulator will also help in maintaining pattern altitudes and getting lined up on dwbasefinal.

3816590,0,t1_cqranrl,Its definitely...  different.  However the driving mechanics are hugely improved on the PC version every car feels different and driving is a whole lot of fun.  Its still derpy you can drive up the side of a mountain in anything you want and the damage model is nonexistant but its fun.I played a lot of GTA IV purely as a racing game and I can see where they were going with the suspension model and all that.  Cars didnt feel like gocarts but on the other hand they felt more like marshmallows and combined with the terrible frame rate on the PS it was like pushing a marshmallow through molasses.  But this game is just a different beast entirely.  Driving in first person is a blast if youre using the  controller you can very accurately take corners stay in lanes etc.  I havent raced online yet but the driving mechanics are definitely interesting enough for online racing to be fun.  Plus you can make your own courses.But I was just looking at the speedometers in GTA V.  Firstly all cars are the same speed most of them max out at  MPH.  The faster cars just accelerate faster but the top speeds are mostly the same.  Second  MPH is more like  MPH.  And despite supposedly being almost twice as fast as highway traffic which goes a steady  MPH youre barely faster than them.  I dont think the speed scale is linear.  The brakes are also way too good you can brake from full speed in like  feet in most cars.  There is very little riskreward play with speed something thats kind of essential in a driving game generally you just keep the right trigger buried all the time because there are not consequences to driving too fast.And I can see why they do all this the world is pretty small.  It takes a few minutes to go from the south of the island to the north but thats because youre capped at what feels like  MPH.  Just hop in a car and drive  MPH and look at the signs and trees coming at you.  It feels very slow because it is very slow.  I wish theyd have just let us have riskreward speed mechanics the ability to go much faster than we should be able to with the danger of very severe crashes and just taught the player to manage their speed a little better.  But if they did that you could probably get from one end of the map to the other in  or so minutes.,flightsim,cqrblfj,8,t5_2qspy

If you want diversity and dont mind the lower graphics IL  is still a great game and the recently updated C.U.P. overhaul mod its HUGE is incredible.Diehard F fan? Falcon  BMS is absolutely incredible. The work that BMS has done to upgrade Falcon  will blow you away. The F is an incredible aircraft and most of the systems are well modeled. Biggest pro a truly dynamic campaign system that is unrivaled with other combat sims. While flying youll be passing other flights tasked on other missions and the result of AI and your own missions will affect the campaign as a whole.Mixed era DCS World. DCS started with a focus on modern airframes but has expanded into just about every postWW era to some degree. The list of aircraft is quite impressive with the full fidelity modules being a gold standard not just for combat flight sims but flight sims in general. Yes you have to buy each plane but its well worth it in my opinion. Most of the modules are full fidelity sims which means youll be reading some manuals before doing much flying.

3940082,0,t3_35kn3i,I think you should get DCS FC.You can go over WWII modules with the BF  FW and P as kodiak says also you can go over the start of the cold war with the F Sabre or the Mig.If you want try the modern fighters you should get Flaming Cliffs  the cockpit is not clickable and you have the Advanced Flight Model only on the F and the Su with FC you also get the Mig and the Su.You also get some simplified but still fun AG planes as the AA and the Su.Falcon BMS is also really fun the F is a great plane and its basically all simulated learning every system is great and it gives you a lot of satisfaction unfortunately you can get some problems with controls and some little crash it is community developed after all.The reason I say DCS is also the fact that the most fun part for the fighters is to fly against human opponents and the multiplayer  is more populated in DCS and its also easier to jump on a server and play alone while Falcon its probably better played in a good clan etc.You can download DCS World and you get access to a Su and a TFD that is basically a two seaters P without guns you can get a feel of the sim and see if you like it.Also you can get Falcon BMS is basically free try it out because it can be really fun but I think you will go wiht DCS after a bit.,flightsim,cr5eir3,2,t5_2qspy

4222626,0,t3_399cyo,Tbh I wouldnt expect to not worry about trying to simulate a lot of the feel parts of flying but that doesnt mean simming wont be helpful. My experience going through my ppl IRL was that the act of physically controlling the aircraft the part which is probably most difficult to simulate accurately in a home sim was actually the easiest aspect to gain proficiency in. This perhaps oddly included landing. Think of It this way. It only took me  hours to solo which obviously includes proficiency at landings but another  to get to my check ride. Theres a lot of stuff post solo and simming becomes more helpful as you start getting into things like planning weather airspace navigating cross country radio comms etc. The AA version of the  is certainly nice and Pilot Edge is definitely a good idea ... If you can handle southern Cal airspace and comms you can probably handle anywhere.

4358360,0,t3_3axrvq,hey rflightsim communityi am new here as i am new to flightsims in general.personally i am a simracer and never really tried out flightsim at all. i own an oculus rift dk for nearly a year now and enjoy my simracing with it since then.last week i installed war thunder from steam since i heard they have pretty solid oculus rift integration and took out my saitek x which i bought for elite dangerous . and now i am hooked. the immersion is so sick and i enjoy just flying high up in the air and watching around. since i enjoyed that so much i went on and searched for flightsims which arent to expensive for a start and found out that fsx was quite cheap due to the steam sale. went on and looked if that has dk support of some kind. all i found was that blog everything that i could read up there was good enough for me to buy fsx for the  euros.today the blog got a new update and as it seems the public alpha and the kickstarter is going to start really soon now th of junethe developer seems to be a redditor himself uanprogrammeris there any love for vr flightsims in this subreddit? in simracing its getting more and more attention and quite a few iracers already have made the switch to the dk like myself,flightsim,csgx4xd,3,t5_2qspy

FSX will go WHATS A GTX  IS THAT AN I YOU HAVE IN YOUR POCKET. Clock speed and single thread processing ability is king as the lions share of processing is dumped into one CPU core.Flight sims even the ones that make good use of GPUs like XPlane and PD ultimately end up being CPU limited when you hit the very top end of hardware and addons Caveat I do not have anywhere near as many addons in XP as I do PD so heavy XP users may be able to advise better here. YMMV if you have low or medium hardware.I would say just get FSX on steam and have a splash around first to see if the bug bites. Then think about upgrades later.,flightsim,csmastl,3,t5_2qspy

4667412,0,t1_ctiv9xl,Rex provides textures only. ASN is a weather engine and will import live or historic weather into the sim. It effectively paints with the available textures and creates both extremely lifelike vistas much more so than default ever can as well as giving correct rain thunder cloud  cell behaviour wind rain etc. Its way more powerful than the default weather system in FSX  PD.REX weather architect is a new thing that allows you to customise your weather and apparently is very good if you want to do flights over water where there are no weather stations and hence cannot control the weather there. I dont have experience with architect but can say for sure that REX PLUS ASN is a very worthy addition IF your PC can handle it.,flightsim,ctivqdh,3,t5_2qspy

There is nothing particularly realistic about simulating flight sitting at a desk using a computer monitor and a USB joystick or yoke.On the subject of XPs blade element flight modelling versus MSFS lookup tables  both have their advantages and disadvantages and neither is necessarily better than the other.

About  months ago I knew very little about computers and ive just immersed myself in forums like this one and Toms Hardware to learn. There are even windows based overclockers that come with the motherboards nowadays. Just get a good liquid cooler like the Corsair H stick it on and run the wizard. Itll get something like that  up to about .Ghz which is a huge improvement. Dont be scurrred! lol,flightsim,cwwpz5v,1,t5_2qspy

5795292,0,t1_cxff8ya,I should clarify that Im in that group of people not used to flying the C.  If someone was more experienced with it it probably wouldnt be a problem.  I would still say its worth removing since it seems its not hard to do  This user reports that doing so results in a dead zone in the center of the throttle well it makes apparent one thats hidden by the detent but I would find it hard to believe removing the detent could possibly hurt the sticks performance.EDIT Did it tonight.  Used the second method and filled the trough in the plastic bit with wax.  Id recommend that over the first to anyone thinking of the same as I would imagine it gives much better resistance.  Without the spring it just felt horribly loose.  It wasnt hard at all but the throttle does indeed have a dead zone where the detent was.  Even with the deadzone now more visible I much prefer it this way.,flightsim,cxfglj0,1,t5_2qspy

Before the advent of said term with regards to mobile devices a App was simply short for application and is still defined as any program or group of programs that is designed for the end user. Period.. Id suggest reading the EULA. It specifically states that they are not required to provide refunds or offline functionality should the GFWL or GFWM services be discontinued which it states is a possibility. The same goes for Steam Origin GoG etc etc etc. Furthermore theyve already discontinued the ability to purchase titles through GFWM and have ceased product support with regards to updates and patches. Its certainly not outside the realm of possibility that they given a complete lack of profit and dwindling user base while costs remain that MS would simply shutter both services.

If your source imagery say from Google has a visible transition between one area taken by one camera on one day and another area taken by another camera on another day... that transition is gonna be right there in the sim. The Sim Heaven photoscenery for my local area must have used source imagery taken at the end of a very dry summer but some areas were taken on an earlier date or during a wetter summer and it was quite jarring to see half a farmers field in a very dry light brown colour and the other half bright yellow with a ripe rape seed crop.Sorry no other shots. Ive got the photoscenery tucked away on an external hard drive somwhere would have to find it and reintall it.The WXPL object placement sceneries help the photoscenery a lot.

7057940,0,t1_d1fzmuk,gtNo its the fact your not being a dick to people and that resonates with your customersNope people pirate primarily because they can get something without paying for it. The copy protection limits the ability to do this so that only some can pirate.gtYou know what else has increased. The number of people on the internet. as well as the number of thing that are available you did say overallDigital sales are decreasing. More people on the internet should result in an increase in digital sales.If Digital sales are decreasing but illegal file sharing has increased that means piracy overall is increasing. And its hurting sales.gtThe top  most pirated PMDG products are the MD    and a pack containing all of themDoesnt establish PMDG products are the most pirated FS products.But PMDG is a very popular product it would be no surprise if such numbers existed that they were near the top of pirated FS products Flight however is doubtfull. As I said they would be at the top because of their popularity not because of poor customer service or copy protection scheme.gtOh and FSdreamteam does have strong copy protection. But its also not one that gets in the way.I guess you havent seen the ton of complaints people have about FSDTs addon manager.gtgtSo someone should steal because buying legally is too difficult ?? Makes no sense.gtThat makes perfect sense. they still want the product. People want a lot of things that doesnt mean they should steal it.If you dont like the difficulty in obtaining it then dont buy it.  If you really want it badly then put up with the copy protection.You have a choice but stealing is never the right choice.gtWhen the pirates are offering a better service than the guy selling the product what do you think will happen!The pirates arent offering a better service.

7160605,0,t3_4dlk3f,Hmmm. My suggestion after rereading it would be to adjust gamma in the video settings. My problem with triple monitors was that lights got so small and invisible as you got closer to the ground. The way I ended up solving it was a pretty sketchy settings file tweak by going in and changing the light size. My assumption is that the light size is dynamically based on the resolution of your monitor or field of view so that they dont show up too big when running at low resolutions. However I have nothing other than intuition to back this up with. Something to think about if its just the point lights that are too small. ,flightsim,d1s3b5m,1,t5_2qspy

7761778,0,t1_d3oerun,Sorry in advance for the long post didnt realise before typing how much of a difference there actually is. For me FSX just worked better. Ive tried so many settings in PD and I just cant match the smoothness of FSX and I have a good PC. Plus PD looks better in some aspects but terrible in others. For example the AA is horrible in PD. I see lots of shimmering in the distance and can never quite get the crisp edges I had in FSX. Im using NI driver hacks. This is what I see with xMSAA and xSS in PD  enlarge the imagesSecondly Ive noticed much more popin in PD. Granted Im not running it on an SSD but nor was FSX and distant textures and objects loaded much faster and further away. This is what I see with LOD on Ultra in PD you can see the distinct line where autogen just stops I never saw this in FSX  Performance doesnt feel as smooth. Average FPS is probably about the same certainly not improved in PD like many claim. Overall I think with a lot of tweaking and good set up FSX with DX can look better than PD and run better. So like I said with cloud and cockpit shadows I think FSX would be perfect. ,flightsim,d3ogcez,2,t5_2qspy

It is great to be able to give an audio command to change your radio frequency and not have to go head down to the radio stack and use the mouse to change frequency. On takeoff being able to keep both hands on the controls and merely say Gear up or control your lights audibly.

I expect to look down right to see it.Regarding Leap Motion yes you should be able to manipulate switches in the cockpit and you can  but without the haptic feedback and the switches being small the chances of hitting the wrong button or applying too muchnot enough power mixture or trim are high.

8881205,0,t3_51t1no,TLDR summaryThe best EFIS display in any GA aircraft in Xplane.  Carenado included.With a completely shit flight model.If a very strong and functional EFIS display is what you are looking for it is sensational value for money.Slight longer the EFIS is really the shining light in these aircraft.  The functionality is just about  there to the real dynon displays Flown sever aircraft with Skyview IRL.  There are a few annoyances I have however when the new pad pops up to enter numbers.  Its smack bang in the middle of the screen completely covering the AH.  If you are hand flying in IMC that is a complete no no. I like to hand fly rather than watch the plane fly for me your millage may vary.Being able to click what you see on the EFIS display is great and really is a pleasure to use when operating in an online ATC space.The external and internal model look a little cartoonish but again I can overlook this due to the massive fidelity of the  EFIS displays.So overall the D is ok but its no Carenado D model.Flight model. Well I have too much to talk about with it. It flies like a radio controlled aircraft with zero inertia. Its flight controls are a joke. There is zero control loading modeled so add full rudder at  knots and watch the plane turn itself inside out.It rolls faster than a FA and has a pitch rate like a extra .It does not fly like a light jet.

8945368,0,t3_52t5e5,On the face of it flight simulator addons are extortionately priced compared to other games. You can pick up entire games for  that have had years of development or you can get scenery for a single airport.I suppose it comes down to the number of users when your audience is hundreds of thousands or more you can afford to sell at a low cost as sheer volume of sales will be enough to turn a profit. Thats quite a bit harder for a limited audience like FSX.That said there are addons that just seem far too expensive for what they are.

Realistic systems and flight dynamics.AA  any of their latest releases are top notch!I do recommend to use Simbrief for your routes in the beginning. Its good enough to start with and especially for being free!I would get REX soft clouds for better and more natural looking clouds.

10217224,0,t1_dc24xzi,I think I didnt quite word it right. Basically it has quite a lot of issues. First of all the two extra axis on the throttle quadrant do not work because of some ripped wiring inside which is something that its had from day one. Also the two throttles are a mess. Theyre not alligned so if the physical throttles are both in the same position one will be significantly behind. They dont even seem to have the same level of linearity for lack of a better term. What I mean by this is that that difference in position will be noticeably larger in the middle than at either ends. Im also having trouble getting them to either  or  unless I set up a pretty big deadzone on both ends making it very hard to estimate when youve hit  or . The pedals are not too bad I guess quite difficult to be precise with them but not a huge issue. But on my unit the right toe brake flickers constantly up to as much as  even with my foot of the pedal. The joystick feels great in the hand however theres an issue with that too but this time by design rather than a malfunction of some sort. The usable soft range of the joystick is very small. Physically you can move it as much as any other joystick but I guess because of the force feedback the actual range reported in game is so small that flying isnt all that pleasant. I dont think Im nitpicking here. Sure its still usable as I dont need the extra axis on the quadrant the brake flickering doesnt affect my flights all that much I can always set all in game throttles to just one of the physical ones and the joystick despite that tiny range is perfectly usable. Its just the whole experience is quite frustrating and not really all that enjoyable. Im a fan of Logitech products. My racing wheel mouse and headset are all Logitech and Im very pleased with all. But this flight system is a real headache.,flightsim,dc26hmo,1,t5_2qspy

10587619,0,t3_5rkd8s,Im actually the opposite PD I am fighting the sim having to adjust settings for whatever I want to do. Sure I can load scenery profiles and config profiles but in XP once Ive set it up I load and fly. No eye balling VAS the whole damn time. I fly PD chronically but it is a pita. Ive never used default aircraft in XP. That being said XP does have a pretty good . As for trimming theres a lot at play here including engine torque weather etc. Some paid airplanes are easier to trim out than others. Airports well theres the scenery gateway. You also have the org site where you try and find your local airport. If all that fails then use WED and build it yourself. Which is fun and relatively easy. Paid aircraft and atc is a whole different kettle of fish. Everyone has their opinion here. My advice is to atleast try and find your local airport try some HD Mesh and buil an Ortho or two for that region. Just give it a go. Also XP is also something you can check out as mentioned by others. UI much more friendly and the control setup a walk in the park. I actually preferred the old style and the amount of options available for control setup is mind boggling in XP. But XP does make XP look dated. And you can demo it which is a plus. Its still in Beta so changes will obviously be coming still but as it stands right now its a decent alternative to FSX and PD. ,flightsim,dd815i8,9,t5_2qspy

For a vanilla install if youre willing to compromise in graphics and settle with fps any modern intel CPU should do the trick but if you want to have good performance and decent graphics you will need an i i avoid the U line and similar.

I havent used the default clouds in years though so im not totally sure if the old clouds could look like that. EDIT after flying with them a little bit longer and trying a few different weather scenarios they are still quite ugly. They seem really blurry for some reason. Not even like low resolution but just out of focus. The smoke from the tires when landingturning too hard looks alot better. The smoke that comes out of the back of the engines i assume its trying to be contrails but it looks like smoke is still super dark looks quite bad. The one thing that is quite better is performance.

11166904,0,t1_dexqmy7,only problem with the r is that its based on speculationweve already seen that the r has already been pushed to basically its max from factory just because the core count is less doesnt necessarily mean it can overclock betteras far as the gb making a difference i dont know ive never used a nvidia gpu for a flight sim so i can only speak on the experiences others have i dont have any issues with gb though so im not sure if that extra gb over  already will really make much of a difference could be wrong tho,flightsim,dexr9as,3,t5_2qspy

11325577,0,t3_61mgjh,Well Ive just recently started my long journey to becoming a glider pilot.  I believe that some addonplanes are might be really close to the real ones regarding systems simulation.  I noticed that when you are flying in reality compared to the flightsim on the PC you see a lot less of the instruments and the outside at once.  While the physical aspects of flight might be very well simulated in the current sims there is a lot more to it than just the physical behaviour of the plane itself. For example in reality there is a lot more sensory input for you to process especially gforces. Just as an example If you fly a glider the air is not always smooth. Its sometimes more like a bumpy road and if you add thermals it feels like you are on a rollercoaster on top of that.So while i can more or less safely land a glider in a sim it is at least for me a completely different ballpark in real life and actually very intimidating at the beginning.  All that said flightsimming can actually lead to difficulties with learning to fly a real plane. In the sim i focused to much on the instruments vs. the outside for visual flying which i have to unlearn now.,flightsim,dffqhft,1,t5_2qspy
