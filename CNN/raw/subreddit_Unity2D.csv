I got up to a nice level screenshot.At that point there was so much xp I was pretty much leveling up every  seconds though. Also when you run into that red circle is it meant to kill all the enemies? Its just it would stop showing all your friends you had gotten they were still firing but werent showing on screen.

644651,0,t3_21h8hs,Im just starting to learn about Unity so keep that in mind but here are some thoughts about the gameTheres no ceiling but you die if you hit the ceiling.  Why not add a ceiling?When you die you dont always fall to the ground.   Like if you hit the ceiling you fall down about half way and float.When you die it doesnt tell you that you died.  Give me a game over screen or stats pretty much anything to give resolution to my shortlived life.  Be aware of color schemes.  The gray colors are bland and some of the colors used dont really go together.  Use something like Color Scheme Designer to pick colors or find ones that go together.  What simple things can you make more creative?  For example instead of snapping back to the beginning as if nothing happened keep the dead dragons where they die and when you start over an egg hatches a new dragon.  This is a borrowed idea for a game.  What can you add to it to make it more unique?  Maybe you have a rechargeable fireball that can blast through crystals?  You have punishment that drives gameplay if you hit something you die but what rewards can you add to the gameplay?  Maybe some type of power up like something that gives you  dragons at once like a multiball type of situation or something.  Or maybe just a slowdown in speed.Good job with the game keep it up.,Unity2D,cgdjpg6,2,t5_2yfb2

After GameData is built I just serialize it for saving and deserialize for loading.The problem is this system probably wont be backwards compatible so if I make changes after release its going to break any old saves.  How do devs normally tackle the issue of save file compatibility between multiple versions?

Hopefully hell read it and enjoy the game!When the game launched the UI was really static and inconsistent and stuff. One night I was just laying in bed and got an image in my head of how to make it better and I did a complete overhaul in like  days XD The official UI tutorials from Unity were a really big help!For the transitions its just a big gameObject that has the could sprites attached. When the player hits a certain point the next stage is enabled and set to the edge of the clouds and then when the player hits a second point the previous stage is deactivated.As for your pooling problem Im not sure since my pooling is a lot different and more rudimentary than Quills solution.

4244974,0,t1_cs4458i,Thank you D The idea of making it loop is nice. I already have a mirror mapper but a looper would also be nice. Noted down.Btw This thing features a so called Room Snippet Editor which allows you to design rooms that get stamped on the map. You can choose one or multiple Snippets randomize and rotate them randomly etc. So you can have a good amount of control on that level too. You could design a few interesting rooms and connect those procedurally or create rather static setups with let say a boss room right in the middle with all paths leading there. etc. So its as random as you like it to be.Im just currently driving the bugs out of that feature D,Unity2D,cs448h1,2,t5_2yfb2

Just take a look again and compare it to the player in editor you can clearly see that if you control the character its smooth but if you dont it isnt.  Edit Alright I figured out so far that it is not network related. When I detach the camera from the player and move the player it looks blurry also so I am pretty sure its because of the way I am moving the player. Im going to try using rigidbodyd to move the player and see if there is any change.,Unity2D,cs55aj2,1,t5_2yfb2

4432797,0,t1_cspfoi6,Yes that kit does require both it seems. Its not uncommon to see games using both. However dtk is cheaper and also comes with a good amount of tools for well d games. Ngui is ultimately easier IMO but dtk isnt too bad. You can utilize DOTween with it too for visual effects. Ngui probably has more community backing though. Many people are still debating whether ngui is needed anymore since .s ui update which was developed by the ngui developer gave us nearly the same tools. The one thing I desperately hate about .s gui system is the lack of support for bitmap fonts. Which means I cant import a custom font with a large outline or pretty effects.

The proper way to handle this is to store the system time when backgrounded and when your game is launched later compare that to the current system time.

Also with this method you will be doing the single tap move initially and then the double tap if thats what you want great but most people dont.

5291798,0,t3_3ngsvy,Cant you just debug it so you know exactly whats happening and dont have to guess? Put a breakpoint inside your first if statement and check what your transform.position etc. is at this point.And if what youre saying is true then you can rewrite your code to something like this    if Input.GetButtonFire         fireFrames            if fireframes gt            Your shooting code in here which is now delayed by  frame.    This is obviously a workaround but its probably acceptable if you cant find the actual reason for why this is happening. At least while Unity works on a fix if its actually a bug.But if what youre after is ensuring all bullets are spawned from the same firing position you could also just compare the position in your ifstatement rather than whether or not the fire button is held down. Just check if transform.position is equal to your firing position and then start spawning your bullets. That way itll look correct no matter how long the delay is.First of all I would rewrite your code to be something like    bool isFiring  Input.GetButtonFireand then pass that variable to Mecanim and use it throughout the rest of your script. Just to make sure it isnt the fact that youre passing Input.GetButtonFire to Mecanim directly that is the problem.,Unity2D,cvo37or,1,t5_2yfb2

6474602,0,t1_czohu7k,Well if you want Pokmon style movement then a D array really is the way to go. It is really the simplest most primitive and least errorprone way to implement movement in a D grid based game.If youre making something small you probably dont even need any rd party assets although there are some good ones out there for tile based games. Unity is also in the process of rolling their own tile based components that should be available soonish. In the mean time just a bunch of GameObjects one for each tile should be fine so long as you arent making massive maps.Obviously if you go procedural then you would generate the array first and spawn prefabs based on the positions of the array but if you want to generate the array from the scene it should also be quite straightforward especially assuming all your GameObjects are  tile size. At the very simplest you create a D array of bool the size of the rectangle containing your level tag all walkable GameObjects use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag to find them and grab the x and y coordinates of their transforms be sure to use Mathf.RoundToInt to convert them to ints and then do mapArrayx y  true. As the default value of bool is false any unwalkable tiles be they wall or outside the map will be false.The trick to this working well is to forget about colliders and physics and all that calculate everything inside the GameController object and then relay that information to the actual GameObjects. The neat thing about using bool if that you just do if mapArrayx y to know whether you can walk there or not. I have to go out now but let me know if you need any further information about this. I dont have a Unity tutorial to hand but Im sure there are plenty that use this kind of method.EDIT btw you can use this for free movement too just check which cells the bounding box of your character is overlapping for collisions.,Unity2D,czp0qej,2,t5_2yfb2

Maybe even the top and bottom if you want.gtThe player box changing in scalegtThe player box changing in position slightlyThese little changes will make the player have to pay attention to a lot more things instead of just one thing that gets too hard. ,Unity2D,d10huyb,3,t5_2yfb2

6988527,0,t1_d18h92f,Well each scene is complete separate from each other. You can even load the currently loaded scene to reset it. If this was me I would probably just have a component with a static color property. Then in the start method get the sprite renderer and set the color. Static methodsproperties do survive scene loads as they exist on the class over all instances not just one instance that gets destroyedrecreated. They are usually considered bad practice and frowned upon but if used sparingly they are a perfectly fine way to have information traverse scenes. Something like this Im at work so Im going from memory        using UnityEngine    using System.Collections        public class ColorChanger  MonoBehaviour         public static Color targetColor                void Start              if targetColor ! null                            SpriteRenderer sr  GetComponentltSpriteRenderergt                ifsr ! null                                    sr.color  targetColor                                        Then on scene load and on instantiate of a new object every gameobject with this component will change its spriterenderer color. You can set the color anywhere you want and it will survive scene changes. You just have to make sure that you are referencing the class name when changing the color. You dont even need to get the component either. Just ColorChanger.targetColor  new Color   ,Unity2D,d18hoio,1,t5_2yfb2
7014743,0,t3_4bpr97,So the draw calls are essentially a count of images that have to be copied to the graphics card. If you are drawing from  different spritesheets that is  draw calls. The goal is to have less images copied to the graphics card. A larger image will take up a little more video memory but be less draw calls than multiple images. However if you are talking only one draw call vs having a lot of duplicates it might just be better to have the draw call.

7443732,0,t3_4h4c4n,Being a game developer or really any kind of developer requires the ability to solve problems... youre asking for someone to show you how to do these things.  Why not try to do them yourself and then when you have problems with something ask for help.. Generally in the programming world its frowned upon to ask how to do an entire task.. in the words of ShiaIm not trying to be mean but you dont have a problem which youre asking for help with.  You have tasks you want someone to show you how to do and thats now how programming works and we wouldnt be doing you any service by showing you how to do these things.  Since Broxxar above already gave you the best answer I suggest you read into those methods he suggeted to solve your problems and if you run into a question ask again!The Unity documentation is going to be your best friend on how to use those methods so read up and actually learn how they work instead of just getting the work from someone else.Thats my programminggamedev tip for you since someone already answered your original question  Good luck and most importantly HAVE FUN!One thing I like to do is this for instance your change block color.. i like to break everything down on all the steps I think i need to acomplish to solve the entire problem.  So before I write a single line of code I break down the entire problem in comments.  Its not always exactly right but it gives me a good idea. make block appear and change color make block appear randomly set a color valueif i didnt know how to solve a step i would then search it out.. How do I make a gameobject appear at run time  then i learn about instantiate.. Awesome now I have this ability in memory and can use it whenever i want.

For this reason I just add ExecuteInEditMode to my script and call it once in the editor. Your suggested solution would work fine. You could also loop through all the children of the body gameobject and do all the reflect function stuff on them if I am understanding your scenario correctly. You would only have to do this once after you load all the sprites.

8130934,0,t3_4qcpl8,Maybe a good rule of thumb is If possible Make your object an prefab and assign all the componentreferences targeting the prefab itself in the inspector the scene needs to be deserialized if the field points to null or to an object doing the assignment here should be the least performance impact. if its possible that your component is instantiated at runtime and needs references from another place as the prefab its instantiate from assign in Awake method. If possible avoid Find and FindByTag There might be a case where a lazyassignment could improve loadtimes ...  fallback if nothing above applies assign in the inspector.Start vs Awake here is a quote from the script referencegt Awake is used to initialize any variables or game state before the game starts. Awake is called only once during the lifetime of the script instance. Awake is called after all objects are initialized so you can safely speak to other objects or query them using eg. GameObject.FindWithTag. Each GameObjects Awake is called in a random order between objects.

9645973,0,t3_5d566d,Hmh sadly Im not familiar with the games you referenced but I hope I got what youre trying to do right.  So if I understood correctly there are two things you want to do  animation and collision ignore. About animation its rather simple you just make the sprite change size  growing as the character reaches maximum jump height and then smaller as it falls down. While youre at it I think you could even use animation events to disable collisions  I must admit I havent used animation to call functions so far so cant be sure if this is the best solution but it does provide you with perfect lining up of the animation and collision ignore. So on the first frame of your animation you should call the function to disable collider and on the last enable it again. Heres something to tell you more about animation events and calling functions from animation You can disable the collider by simply using    BoxColliderD collGetComponentltBoxColliderDgt    coll.enabled  falseHowever there are problems I think youll encounter with this approach. If you disable collider player could also jump over level boundaries or walls hes not supposed to. With that in mind theres probably something you could do about it with layer matrix or something maybe even making it so that you actually disable collider on an object that will be jumped over and not the player. You could do that by raycasting or using OverlapCircle to find the objects around players and call the functions on them. That could work since all your jumpable objects will have your Jumpable script so you could do something like this    when player jumps    GameObject  obstacles  PhysicsD.OverlapCircletransform.positionradiuslayerMask    foreach GameObject go in obstacles            Jumpable jgo.GetComponentltJumpablegt            if j!null                    j.DisableCollisions                However Im writing this in a hurry in . so there is good possibility that this small part of code will have to be changed to work as it should.  Also its probably not the best solution but I think its the easiest to understand.And yeah another problem you might face is what happens if the player finishes the jump inside that is above the obstacle? Dont have that much experience with top down games so I dont know how that problem is usually handled.,Unity2D,da22dia,3,t5_2yfb2

How do i set it to adjust to whatever the horizontal and vertical axes are? So it will be able to move  and  and all  directions.Next Id like to ask where in your code I should put code to let it animate and if the animation code is any different than what I have in my script.And thanks Im still learning this and for my code I mixed  sets of code together.

9796264,0,t1_dakl7y5,Its kind of weird to set an animation then have to check that animation to see what direction youre facing. Much better to have a DirectionFacing variable then use that to determine the animations as well as the direction of any projectiles.You can see the variables of transform in the documentation here The three directions are Up Right and Forward.

10690315,0,t3_5sxjj8,The lava and clouds look like theyre going a bit overkill on overdraw. Keep in mind that many particles drawing over top of one another will not perform very nicely on mobile.Looks like youre doing some experimenting with additive vs alpha blend which is great. With your fires and lava and what not try introducing just a bit of blue to the base colors so that the hottest areas blend to white. Your rain dropplets could be a bit longer and move a bit quicker. Maybe also experiment with variable speed and alpha here to break up the effect a bit otherwise it feels a bit like one scrolling image and it may as well be!And shameless self promotion I have a video on my channel that you might learn a few tricks from.

11309367,0,t3_61e1wn,I have two blog posts that should helpIt looks like youre on the right track. But it looks like you are raycasting from the enemy to the player directly rather than in the direction the enemy is looking. So youll always hit the player unless there is an obstacle in the way regardless of the direction the enemy is facing.You should check that something was hit before checking the tag    ifsighttest             the rest of your code    Since youre new Im going to save you endless future pain!Instead of    ifsighttest.collider.tag  Playeruse    ifsighttest.collider.CompareTagPlayerIts a better way of doing the same thing. It will save you from typos it checks for a valid tag and it is more efficient.Also you should restrict your raycasts to specific layers by adding a layermask parameter. If the enemy only cares about the player then give the player his own layer and only raycast against that layer and any layer that contains obstacles that block the view. More efficient and less prone to problems.But what in your code is specifically not working?,Unity2D,dfdwe9g,2,t5_2yfb2

I understand your reasoning and it may very well be that you could make it work for a specific screen size and use case but I think its harder than you make it out to be. And your pixel size for sprites in Unity is completely up to you. Sometimes I use  unit   pixel and sometimes I use  unit   pixels or  pixels or whatever I feel makes the most sense for the current project.
