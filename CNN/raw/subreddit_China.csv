8263,0,t1_cefaidj,The expected result given that he crashed and was subsequently rescued by a coast guard would be that the Chinese coast guard rescued him. Since China claims sovereignty over the area it would presumably be their responsibility.Furthermore the reason he went out in a hot air balloon in the first place was to assert that the area belonged to China and not Japan.Its therefore ironic because not only did he essentially prove the opposite by crashing since the Japanese coast guard ended up noticing him instead of the Chinese coast guard the very nation he tried to put so much effort into discrediting ended up saving his life and he however reluctantly ended up choosing to use its public services.So Im going to declare that there is a significant element of irony in this story.In my experience on Reddit people who think theyre smarter than everybody else wrongly attempt to point out misuses of the word ironic more frequently than people actually misuse the word ironic.,China,cefdkuk,6,t5_2qh2v

There are many hawks in the US that would have the US invade Iran NK send troops to Syria put a missile shield in Poland and Turkey scale up Afghanistan and increase military intervention in Pakistan. All of those actions would be horribly destabilizing but that does reflect the official stance of the US government.There are different factions within the CCP just as there are factions in the US government.

But ultimately no country is gonna take that sort of things into account when making policies Im referring to your earlier comment on Russia in another thread.To be honest I even doubt whatever department thats in charge of controlling the Internet cares. They dont get paid enough to take down anything the party disagree with  they only bother to take down whats big enough to threaten the leadership. For example  I just talked about this topic on a Chinese nonmainstream forum without being censored because a random person ranting his disagreement with the countrys foreign policy will not bring down whoevers in charge. But a NYT journalists public report on formal leaders offshore wealth might start something and thats why he got kicked out. Also regarding your history of aggression argument  you might consider to stop referring to history when discussing todays politics aka realpolitik. Politicians use historyread propaganda with only one purpose to control people.

But Im a white American so I tend to gravitate towards examples about white Americans first probably because of all that Sunday school and the seeing the speck in someone elses eye while ignoring the log in your own thing. I would say that generalized xenophobia is probably more of the issue in East Asia although it gets pretty confused regarding white people because theres definitely been more ingesting of the white supremacist narrative through media and advertising. So while some people want to go all Boxer Rebellion . on you other people want to make you into a model for their Taobao store because Western people are somehow more innately attractive because of big noses or whatever.

747170,0,t3_22oz7z,From wiki Many early Chinese emperors are speculated to have had homosexual relationships accompanied by heterosexual ones. Opposition to homosexuality according to the study by Hinsch did not become firmly established in China until the th and th centuries through the Westernization efforts of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. On the other hand Guliks influential study argued that the Mongol Yuan dynasty introduced a more ascetic attitude to sexuality in general. It is also argued that the classical Chinese were unable to express homosexuality in a coherent and empathetic manner. Thus it may remain for further research to determine the question of whether antigay attitudes in Modern China can be significantly attributed to the entrance of Western attitudes into China or whether opposition was merely not expressed in a coherent manner. Either way it is indisputable that homosexual sodomy was banned in the Peoples Republic of China from at least the twentieth century until it was legalized in . In  homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental illnesses in China.,China,cgp7k2l,2,t5_2qh2v

973852,0,t1_chevmfb,I just bought a house too.  Comparing prices here with Vancouver where I used to live Im doing better here.  In Vancouver I had to split rent with  roommates could afford to go out maybe twice a month and was tired all the time from my work and commute.Working the same amount here my income in raw cash is roughly  times as high.  The price per square meter of my apartment when I bought it is about the same as where I lived in Vancouver which is ridiculous because Vancouver is x nicer than this city and the price of the goods I bought to fill the apartment is also about the same or even more expensive here.  But the price of the labor to put it all together is like th what Id pay in Canada.  I also dont have any monthly property taxesthat cost is all frontloaded to the initial purchase price which is what drove it up into Vancouver territory in the first place and the utilities are cheaper too.  Overall its definitely worked out much cheaper to buy and own a house here as it should be because again Vancouver is way nicer.  But I dont feel screwed at all by the tradeoff and the fact that I make about  a year here right now whereas in Vancouver Id have to probably do another year degree at least and still be somewhat fortunate to get that kind of job certainly makes the decision to stay easier.,China,chezil2,1,t5_2qh2v

1111635,0,t3_26u06t,The Tiananmen Square saga is one of the most tragic and ironic incidents of modern history. Few people understand just how dramatic it was and how it was just the visible tip of a much larger internal conflict which had been unfolding within the CCP for years. Goodintentioned reformers among both the students and the government were betrayed by hardliners on both sides. Ironically the ongoing protests were main reason the CCP reformist faction lead by General Secretary Zhao Ziyang lost legitimacy and was pushed aside by the hardliners lead by Li Peng who used the protest to justify a political crackdown. Among the students chaos and disorganization ruled and there was no clear consensusthus negotiation with the government became impossible. Amid the confusion a young female PKU student named Chai Ling declared herself leader of the protest and called for no negotiation with the CCP reinstated the hunger strike and proclaimed that the square should run with blood rather than surrender. She felt that she and the students should sacrifice their lives and thus cause the masses to rise up in their memory. The tragedy was that most of the students in the square aside from a core group of activists were probably there to have fun as much as anything it was a party for them rather than a violent protest. They were naive and young and had no notion that they would be in any danger. Chai Ling and the other student leaders fully understood what was coming.Meanwhile it became clear to the reformists in the CCP that they had lost and that Li Peng was about to finally gain full control of the situation. On the eve of the military crackdown Zhao Ziyang the general secretary of the CCP waded into the crowds of students in Tiananmen and begged them to stand down trying desperately to convey the futility of the situation. Interestingly he was accompanied by his secretary a very young Wen Jiabao who survived the incident unscathed.In any case Chai Ling and the student leaders ignored Zhaos beseechment and the rest is history. As they wished the square ran with blood. Zhao was placed under house arrest until his death. Chai Ling escaped the square and fled to the United States where she lives to this day. The oncestrong internal democratization movement in China forever ground to a halt and marshal law was declared.Many people fail to realize that China has never been as free as it was briefly in the lates and that the political crackdown instated after Tiananmen was never truly lifted.,China,chungas,47,t5_2qh2v

1498329,0,t3_2bckrw,I kind of follow dota on and off. For those who dont know this years TI The Internationa has been the biggest in prize pool for dota ever. TI is basically the world cup of Dota. NewBee is also rumored to be somewhat racist because apparently they refused to scrim with another team because it had a nonChinese player on it. Im not too sure if this is founded in fact or not but I wouldnt rule it out to be false. Neither of the final teams were fan favorites and if you search on reddit its very apparent that the fact that theyre both Chinese is a bit of a turnoff for other players. Vici Gaming slaughtered their opponents through fast pushing which might have been a surprise because Chinese Dota players are traditionally known for farming until late game. NewBee lost one game in a Best out of  but went on to win three in a row by out drafting Vici and countering their picks. Overall TI has been pretty disappointing this year. Chinese teams defeated all of the favorites and even the one Chinese team westerners cared about DK got smashed so basically there was nobody to really root for during the finals. NewBee didnt even really show any emotions when they won which is somewhat understandable. They crushed Vici so heavily that there was no real doubt they would lose after the first ten minutes of each game. Really underwhelming. ,China,cj4395z,0,t5_2qh2v

You should probably start preparing for a new relationship or some serious time alone to grow.Edit Did Vivian go back to Taiwan recently and now she is back in the United States?

1823091,0,t1_ck8t1xi,Duly noted on Chaucer. Thats two big gaffs on English literature in one comment. Shows how much I know!As for the Chinese stuff I guess it depends on who you talk to about it. Id say slightly fewer people understand Zhuangzi in China than understand Plato or Descartes in the West. I know quite a few people here who are well versed in the whole thing.I think everyone with a decent education has had quite a bit of classical Chinese shoved down their throats in school. If they didnt study a lot of Zhuangzi they at least read the Three Character Classic Tang poetry and Ming novels. As a result they dont see classical Chinese as such a great leap from modern Chinese even though it is especially for the older texts.Another thing though is that for texts like Lao Zi Zhuangzi and Confucius the language is so vague and open in the first place that even a translation into modern Chinese involves making a lot of decisions about what the author is actually trying to say. So if you already speak modern Chinese youre probably better off taking a crack at one of the widely available annotated versions the equivalent of our Shakespeare readers andor reading books about these thinkers.,China,ck8vea0,4,t5_2qh2v

2065372,0,t1_cl1q5hs,The real issue with western democracies is not the quality of the candidates but the quality of the electorate itself. People are not willing to properly participate in their democracies even at the lowest local level where they have the most influence. As a result politicians are not held accountable ineffective incumbents live off the public coffers and governance suffers. That said democracys greatest achievement is not and never was efficiency  this is the straw man that Eric X. Li offers in the video. Democracy is great because it allows peaceful regime change and stability. Democratic governments that function well last for a long time and its the lack of war and civil strife that has made countries rich not the quality of the legislature that gets elected.     China may seem like an exception for now but history shows that autocratic regimes do not last. When the times go badly people overthrow the regime in a bloody revolution. If you look at the breadth of the policy platform that Li outlines the party may have been in control but during the Cultural Revolution there were thousands of deaths and riots.

2098358,0,t1_cl6j4tz,What is an ideal democracy?  There is no such thing.  Furthermore politicians generally will not ask peoples opinions about every issue.  The American government is a representative government which means  that you elect an individual because you trust their judgement and have faith in the decisions that they make.  They are expected to deal with the problems in the best way they see fit not in what the majority feels is the best way.  The thing about American form of democracy is that the national politicians are not just looking out for the majority donor.  They will vote for the majority donor if its not an issue that conflicts with what their constituents want but for the most part they will do whatever they can to keep their voting population happy.  For proof of this look at the Republicans shifting further to the right out of fear of being challenged in primaries and voted out.  Look at how Harry Reid shut down Yucca Mountain.

At the party he looked longingly towards her.  He was another guy that could have had almost any girl on campus but never actually went out with anyone.  He starred longingly at my girlfriend during the party when he thought Ishe wasnt looking.Now Ibek he was actually born and raised in China so he was bilingual in Mandarin but he told me that hed gotten tired of Chinese women.  He left his Han girlfriend of two years every girl on campus wondered why but he said that she was way to spoiled and partied every weekend and has probably been to every whore house in Beijing and Xinjiang.  He longingly told me about how much pussy he got when he was studying abroad in Paris and how he loved non Asian women he goes to Yale now and every picture I see of him on Facebook has a white or latina girl with himGreat group of people just that the guys except Ibek need to step up their game!,China,cm23vqc,1,t5_2qh2v

When Chinese people see me they automatically assume I cant understand or speak to them so they wont speak to me either.  I take music lessons here and I was hoping my teacher would help me improve my chinese by speaking to me all the time instead she stays silent the whole lesson.  Everywhere I go where I have to talk to someone bookstores hotels the clinic shops restaurants... Ill say something in Chinese and then watch as the shop assistant or receptionists scrambles to say something in English.  I listen as they say in Chinese I cant talk to him! I cant speak English! they say to each other right in front of me how can I say this to him in English! Even though Im perfectly capable of understanding the Chinese. At the store one time the cashier asked me for my signature on a receipt and just as he did the girl behind me jumped in and said He doesnt understand!! I replied in Chinese I understand its not very hard and Im not stupid.I dont think they have any right to be upset with us that we cant speak their language nobody expects us to and nobody will speak to me in mandarin anyway.

2386395,0,t1_cm6jt8v,gtIf Chinese culture is so against making money you wouldnt expect any sort of major trading or currency development in Chinese history.......a little research shows this not to be the case.You are quite right People in China do love making money. It has no conflict with my proposal that the Chinese culture as in the original the traditional Chinese culture are completely anticapitalistic since who said anything about the Chinese have to honor their traditional culture  all the time?It might strike you as completely unbelievable and odd if I tell you a lot of successful businessmen in CHina are ardent Maoist and are nostalgic about culture revolution. Human beings are a complicated and sometimes dishonest bunch. A lot of scientists are pious believers. So why is the traditional culture a problem then? Since it does not interfere daily business transactions? Well you have to look at the bigger picture. On the social level people despise businessmen in general. Its not anything like we dislike Donald Trump because hes a swaggering double talking douchebag. The average Chinese actually hate successful business people and would draw without hesitation the conclusion that the  of rich people got rich by crooked means. Thats a rather extraordinary claim but average Chinese actually do believe that. In the west it is likely such belief can only be agreed upon by a fringe element of the population.Thats merely scratching the surface. The worse problem would be Chinese overall way of thinking when it comes to the issue of financial success. Government and Market public and private sector doesnt have to be enemies but there most certainly exists a rivalry or competition between the two. For Chinese the most decent way for one to get rich would be to become a high ranking official in the government so he can enjoy both the stability of a job and its welfare and benefits. In other words traditionally and in modern times most Chinese became government employees not because of naive idealism or because they dont have a better option but for the sole purpose of personal gains. Nevertheless they would write a lot about how they want to serve the massesAnd of course all the interpersonal relations and all the backdoor deals as well as backstabbing in the political arena would far surpass the wildest imagination of any college graduate of modern China or the champion of a royal test. They would soon find out that they have to deal with impossible situations quandaries that do not mean to be solved by mere mortals and they are terribly terribly underpaid and underappreciated. And what happens next? They have administrative power in their hands right? Thus the rampant tenacious and seemingly endless corruption. In the west thats not a problem at all. If you want to be rich become a craftsman a watchmaker a trader a dealer. Of course people do try to get into the government for personal gains but they dont HAVE TO. In China the dealing and trading kind are constantly looked down upon. A wealthy businessmen from Anhui in Ming Dynasty once built  and half a room for his massive residential complex in the Ming capitol.  and half because  is a sacred number and can only be adopted by the emperor. If this businessman dared to build just  rooms or more there will be his friends his acquaintances his visitors  usually are well educated people who are very likely to go tell on him. Most Chinese if were asked to choose between the government authority which utilizes mainly coercive mechanisms and the marketplace which is based solely on voluntary interaction will choose the government. All thanks to Confucius tireless preaching and indoctrination. I hope this is a satisfactory response I can write a book about it but I will be one of the least qualified. About the corruption in CHinese society both in ancient times and in modern times I once told my little theory observation if you will to a professor of peoples university.

About  ounces maybe more? I didnt measure.Then I added a bit of ketchup. Now I really should not have done that. I usually put tomato paste in and they had some at Metro but only a huge can I figured I could get by with some ketchup but I really could taste the ketchup and that bothered me.I also cut up a medium sized carrot and like  sticks of celery and put it in the pot. Oh and a medium sized bag of mushrooms. Oh and one medium spicy chili.Anway so after browning the beefoniongarlic I added it to the pot of beans and tomatoes etc.. and let it sit for a few hours.I added spices as I went to fine tune the flavour.I added chinese vinegar I am not sure why I did this but I think it helped make up for the fact that I used ketchup instead of tomato pasteSoy sauce Fennelcuminchili powderbrown sugarOh and I also added half a can of spaghetti sauce because the  cans of crushed tomatoes were not really enough.

2889634,0,t1_cnrmkde,I am actually a German engineer and although I do not work for any car manufacorer right now I still have many friends who know what goes on on the market.The mistake many consumers do is that they look on the market only with they eyes of the consumer. The consumer thinks French cars are okay too. So why are there so much more German cars?The key here is to look at China with they eyes of the car manufactorers The CEO of VW said in  that China is not will be! their most important market. And some said he is crazy. Most German manufactorers already decided  years ago to invest in the Chinese market. This was a time in which the rapid growth of China just started and many people in the west thought that the Chinese bubble will burst in the next few years like it did in India. The German manufactorers took a gamble and won. Mercedes was actaully quite late. But they profit from the other strong German manufactorers in China.Today French manufactorers lack the infrastructure to sell more cars in China. Even if Chinese people want to buy Renaults. Renault can not just get  mio Renaults to China. I mean they could. But it would be way too expensive.VW makes a lot of money already with every sold car. Renaults does not. Renault barely manages to get its cars to China. If Renault starts to sell cars cheaper than the production costs to get track in China VW could just reduce the prices of its cars by  and would still earn money. And Renault would not stand a chance.It is hard to get track in a new market for any company. Do you have an idea how to improve Wal Mart? Great! But you can not just open your own Wal Mart and add your own idea. People wont buy in your store. And even if they start buying in your store Wal Mart will just copy your idea and reduce its prices a little until you are out of business.VW is doing the same thing with Renault in China. If VW and Renault want to sell a car of the same quailty in China it would be like thisVW has to spend . to produce it in China. And can sell it for .. Renault has to spend . to produce the same car. And can sell it for only . because VW has a better image. And most Chinese people would still buy the VW. And if Renaults still gets dangorous for VW VW would just sell its car for ..Renault could invest about  bio dollars in China to get even with VW in terms of infrastructure. But they still have no gurantee if Chinese people would start buying Renaults instead of VWs. Would you take this risk if you were CEO of Renault?,China,cnwjzbt,2,t5_2qh2v

3099354,0,t3_2vnfol,Id imagine if you compared Americans you met in Iraq or Afghanistan with ordinary Americans living in the States youd have two different visions of what American culture is. Thered be similarities sure but seeing American culture as an occupying force rather than a part of ordinary daytoday life accepted willingly be Americans themselves as opposed to American culture being imposed by force on foreigners will change how you perceive that culture. Without going into whether Xin Jiang ought to be a part of China or not it sounds like a place under siege or occupied by the Chinese military. It is also clear that many Uighurs are unhappy with this situation. Youre inevitably going to see Chinese culture in a negative way in that context. So I dont think youre necessarily unsatisfied with Chinese culture per se just in the context of the Chinese as occupiers. edit Im kind of annoyed that the OPs post is being downvoted.

3117696,0,t1_col21ek,Yes.  But to get to that position where you know how things work in China you got to get in on the ground.  Which means you need work experience in at the HQ or at a main business unit before being sent to China.  In Japan if you speak really really good you can compete with the locals and your foreigness may even be an advantage.  You wont be the token whitey.

Employees their rights even the long term future for instance Mercedes cars used to be super reliable now they are junk. They did this to win short term profits.While Asia has some funny things. Japan for instance has uber overstaffing of everything. Old tech like faxes are still used and there is a whole lot of make work. Offices have tea ladies which the UK got rid of  years ago in favour of make yer own.Or the HK MTR when it gets busy in the mornings and evenings they have an army of people to stand and hold signs on the platforms and the entrances to the stations. While in the UK there is no such thing or they use a block of concrete to hold the sign up. Hell I remember a bloke in Beijing who manned a zebra crossing... we sometimes see this outside schools in the UK.Or the way that people pump your gas in Asia.

3131547,0,t3_2w0qgo,Yeah dude. Chinese culture is absolutely this way. Unfortunately most  Chinese people are completely  slaves to what I refer to as Mandate from Above which means what their parents teachers and government tell them to do  which is to marry a Chinese man who has money and produce grandchildren.Sorry man. I know this really sucks and its unfortunate that she was weak willed enough to allow her interest in you to be hijacked by what her parents think. You are a good deal younger than her and in those four years a lot of shit can happen that can change you.Leave her be. Respect yourself. Youre worth more than that.

3131704,0,t1_comjvzs,gtMy only real thoughts are that you have to ask as to what she really wants honestly. Chinese in general are completely clueless about that. Chinese culture is a culture that discourages critical analysis and rational thinking. Ask any kid that works  hours a day trying to get into a good collegeWhy are you working so hard? They will most certainly tell you a good college can give you a shiny diploma which means a good job which means material wellbeing and perhaps in the future they could get rich.Thats why so many kids with stellar Gaokao scores chose to go to Beijing University for ArcheologicalChinese LiteratureGeologic etc. etc. degrees and ended up one day selling pork or s in the streets as reported many times by the news media. They dont know what they want and they dont bother to ponder the big question. Their all and only motivation for doing something is pretty much because everybody else is doin it. Typical hivebee mentality.And under the most circumstances those goals that a young Chinese had are not really his in the first place they were handed down by his parents. Thats why you see them getting married as early as  right after graduating from college that why although making a meager wage of perhaps  bucks a month they have the audacity to shoulder the burden of auto loans and housing mortgages. The rootcause of course has  a lot to do with Confucians . From the day one a Chinese were born they were supposed to be a slave of hisher parents.

After a delay of  hour caused by a kid throwing a tantrum on the th of Lichun another Chinese passenger caused another delay when they refused to close the toilet door when changing their babys diaper on a flight to beijing causing the odor of turd to fill the cabin.

His kind have only slightly changed their tune from singing the praises of the triumphalist Soviet to that of the America eternal. History doesnt end nor is it ever a clean linear process even in hindsight. The rise of America was punctuated by civil war massive political corruption a great depression and two global conflagrations yet its power continued along an upward trajectory. Likewise Japans own economic growth was interrupted by massive economic upheavels of the s and s that at the time seemed devastating. Ironically enough Chinas current level of prosperity vis a vis the United States is similar to that of Japans prior to the nd world war. Germany witnessed almost a tenth of its population wiped out its cities obliterated into rubble and an entire generation of the flower of german youth its actual best and brightest fertilizing European battlefields. Yet a mere two decades later they were again challenging the economies of the victorious allies. What insipid courtiers and various bureucratic imperial functionaries do not understand is the resilience of the human spirit and its capacity to endure and overcome adversity instead seeing the world as wholey mechanistic and all humans as cowardly and feeble as themselves. Useless without the ever present all powerful hand of the state. Their myopia leads them to see non performing loan ratios as the end all be all of history and their own degenerate collapsing liberal order as the ideal which humanity is to be judged in its moral worth.The ressurection of China was never the doing of the Communist party and its welcome demise would hardly be the end of it except to imbeciles whose vision of the existence ends four quarters into the future. The Chinese nation is being rebuilt by the blood sweat and sacrifice of the Han race and not by the thieving kleptocratic Communist collaborators seeking sanctuary in the West. The west hilariously calls them our elites because they so closely resembel their own. Thieving deracinated cowardly opportunists with absolutely zero sense of duty or responsibility are now making their way to the metropoles of the Anglo American imperium.

When the day comes you have to do an I you may or may not encounter difficulties with Part  depending on your current salary employment history etc.  Be sure to file federal taxes and make sure you have a parent or sibling would be willing to cosign the sponsorship.  It would be much worse to get married in America under these circumstances.  When your fiancee enters America shed either need to enter on a K series visa or commit visa fraud.  Any other visa tourist type carries with it a statement that she does not have immigration intent.  Intent to marry an American is considered immigration intent even if you wait awhile to drop the green card application.Speaking of which be sure to brush up on your options for either a green card and maintaining it while abroad or on the spousal visas she could enter on.I met and married my wife while she was a student in America.  She was getting a PhD and had been on a F series visas for some time prior to us marrying and the entire process was smooth.  Greencard in hand two months after marriage.  We had a marriage ceremony in China long before pulling any paperwork by a good year since were moved in before marriage but her parents want a ceremony.  That is to say the dinner the host etc in her hometown.  We never pulled a marriage cert in China and did it all stateside at our leisure.  As long as USCIS isnt wiretapping the hotel you have a ceremony in they never know that happened to hold against you. When the greencard time comes people will talk about photos of you together etc.  USCIS is well aware of what photoshop is can do though.  Not to mention just staging some photos.  Joint assets mortgage with both names etc are really king for making USCIS believe this is a real marriage and not a shame one.  ,China,cpd2gil,3,t5_2qh2v

I went there another time and ordered the same dish and it came out the same way.  I looked at another table and the same dish was prepared properly.  I asked for the waitress to come over and I asked her what was the dish on our table.  She said it was di san xian.  I pointed out the dish on the other table and asked the same question she said it was di san xian.  I asked her why our dish had cucumbers rather than peppers.  I told her to send back our dish and prepare it the right way.  She took the dish but when she arrived she said they had run out of peppers.  Other dishes were coming out from the kitchen loaded with peppers.I almost got up and walked out of that place but my GF fempat calmed me down.  I was seriously triggered and in need of copious amounts of booze to calm the rage.Second thing Inability to do anything outside their basic job of bringing food to the table.Recently I went to a shitty burger spot that just opened in my city.

From what Ive seen Dama finds something and earns a return. Happy about the profit she tells Damas about her good fortune urging them to invest. They invest which in turn drives up the demand and with it prices rise. With higher prices supply increases but the amount of new investors prices continue to rise. When supply finally does been adequateread abundant youve got a bunch of investors who dont really care about the underlying asset they own. From what Ive observed so far the market has a hard time finding its way back to the right price and supply amp demand levels.

3565213,0,t3_315mzu,Text of article Following what experts called a major breach of public trust and confidence Google has announced that it will no longer recognise security certificates issued by the official China Internet Network Information Centre CNNIC.CNNIC responded to Googles announcement with a defence of its practices calling the search giants move unacceptable.Last month CNNIC issued security certificates for a number of domains including Googles without their permission. Security certificates are akin to a website or online services fingerprint and tell a browser whether it can be trusted. By issuing unapproved certificates CNNIC risked compromising the encryption protocols used to protect users of email services and other secure websites.CNNIC is included in all major root stores and so the misissued certificates would be trusted by almost all browsers and operating systems Google said in a statement.Officials told Google that they had contracted with Mongoliabased MCS Holdings which said it would only issue certificates for domains it had registered.However rather than keep the private key in a suitable hardware security module MCS installed it in a maninthemiddle proxy. These devices intercept secure connections by masquerading as the intended destination and are sometimes used by companies to intercept their employees secure traffic for monitoring or legal reasons Google said.Tom Lowenthal a security and surveillance expert at the Committee to Protect Journalists said that the move marked a major breach of public trust and confidence.The deliberate breach had the potential to seriously endanger vulnerable users such as journalists communicating with sources he wrote.On Wednesday Google said that as a result of a joint investigation of the events surrounding this incident by Google and CNNIC it would no longer recognise certificates issued by the Chinese authority.The company said that it did not believe any other certificates had been affected aside from those issued by MCS and praised CNNIC for taking steps to improve security. We welcome them to reapply once suitable technical and procedural controls are in place.In a response posted online on Wednesday CNNIC said Googles decision was unacceptable and unintelligible and called on the company to consider user rights and interests. For the users that CNNIC has already issued the certificates to we guarantee that your lawful rights and interests will not be affected the agency said.Googles move comes as US president Barack Obama issued an executive order declaring cybersecurity a national emergency in the wake of a concerted attack on the opensource code repository GitHub.,China,cpynsus,9,t5_2qh2v

Also work on your reading comprehension as your rebuttal isnt even related to the main thesis of my argument.  And what Im talking about is how youre attempting to use the US and Japans historical annexation of far flung territories to justify Chinas current aggressive expansionism in the South China sea. Yes Okinawa and Hawaii are far away from their respective mother countries but they were both annexed by their respective mother countries in a era when the geopolitical climate was rather different. Nations were still building empires engaging in colonialism  mercantilism and a whole host of other behaviours that are no longer considered justifiable by the modern international community. But thats exactly my point China doesnt care what the international community thinks and though the rest of the world thinks their aggressive stance in the South China sea is in contravention of international law China knows they can get away with what is essentially illegal colonization of a international or other states sovereign waters. ,China,cpyvmcm,1,t5_2qh2v

I also believe that in addition to this we should join the proposed deal between Australia and Japan and develop a fleet of state of the art diesel subs.  Acquiring a squadron that will be permanently stationed in the Pacific and buying another squadron to take care of our coastal waters.Adding a supplementary force of diesel subs would free up our nuclear vessels for our many world wide commitments.  This approach would also collapse costs while greatly increasing our combat power facing China.  By joining in the production run with Australia and Japan we could bring down unit costs and maintenance costs for all three nations.,China,cq1udht,1,t5_2qh2v

3673285,0,t1_cqaa3cl,gtCharity has existed in numerous cultures and religions for millennia not just Christianity the ancient Greeks as you mention the Indians Hindus Buddhists Jainists the Romans... Ancient China lacked formal charities and charitable acts outside of festival alms but did not lack formal religions such as Daoism Taoism and the numerous smaller local faiths and beliefs  its just that Confucianism which fixed and formalised human relationships somewhat unnaturally I believe around the family and authority kind of nixed charitable affairs and then mutated into what we have today. Even then however theres a semiformal begging tradition in China...Taoism was never really an institutionalised religion that had a sold clerical hierarchy it was more of an individualised philosophy that any person could adhere to even if they had another dogmatic belief to go with it like Christianity minus the rituals. gtAnd while they may not be official religions Confucianism and Maoism both basically fill the same mental and spiritual gap in the human psyche. Not today it doesnt. The vaccum today is materalism soulless materialism. That spiritual hole needs to be filled with something meaningful.gtReligion is not a solution because it is and always has been an explanation and justification for natural human acts. And theres nothing wrong with that at all. Evil acts are evil no religion teaches evil it can be inspired to do evil but thats due to lack of understanding. Evil acts can be done in the name of secular thought too.gtPouring Christianity into China isnt automatically going to result in a harmonious caring society Mexico is Catholic as Hell as is Brazil and look how things are going there  and America is awash with materialism and thats an absurdly religious society by Western standards its going to take a reduction in the gap between the super rich and super poor a promulgation of values that encourage civility and thoughtfulness which exist independently of religion and a quashing of quasiConfucian family and societal values. Youre using examples from countries that already have an inherent problem thats unrelated to religion. Mexicans and Brazilians are very friendly and have an outgoing culture but thats down to the Spanish influence largely anyways same with the Philippines  and Christianity there is cited as a huge factor in consistently ranking high on happiness index. It doesnt need to be Christianity however. Because Christianity can of lacks solid teachings of what to do in certain situations and can easily be altered like the CCP have done. Also Christianity is associated with the West so they wont like it at all. Islam is a thorough religion which the Hui follow and has deeper roots in the Eastern world and they follow the teachings of both classical Islamic texts and authentic Mencius teachings which some say waters down the extremist tendencies. Both economically viable and spiritually thriving. With a bit of modification here and there such as like you said discarding quasiConfucian values  a perfect balance can be struck. On top of that it will not only be economical but cultural exchanges like the old Silk Road with the Middle East Central Asia and South East Asia far greater than it is now. China can learn a lot from its neighbours in this sense it will add to the diversity too.The proposed new Silk Road is an utter farce because its simply economical with no emphasis on civic refinement like the ancient one which then puts everything back to square one. ,China,cqaz8k4,1,t5_2qh2v

3911070,0,t3_358hbc,Weve had this argument many times but China really isnt much cheaper if the quality is the same and in many cases China is more expensive.Electronics cars clothes. The same item is cheaper in the US unless you are looking at the cheapest options. Same goes for iPhones Starbucks any luxury or brandname product.Anything imported is almost certainly more expensive in China as are niche items which dont appeal to Chinese consumers.Even food might look more expensive on paper but when you take the quality cleanliness and nutritional value into consideration you often get more bang for your buck in the US. McDonalds is a great example sure its cheaper in China but its worse. The last time I was in the states I had an angus swiss burger or something like that and it blew me away.

3914053,0,t3_35a4f5,Me Id do one of several thingsI would buy upworthless land near Ordos. Id take advantage of the glut in solar panels Chinese companies have been dumping on Europe enough to prompt a trade war or build a mirror solar furnace and build a gigantic solar power plant there. As societies develop there is ALWAYS an increasing demand for energy. As China gets richer like all other countries before it environmental regulation will tighten up. A couple of blokes could be hired to dust the panels off everyday.Or Id go to Korea and build a milk pasteurisation plant. Korea has a glut of milk. Due to differing pasteurisation standards Korea cant export milk to China. Milk producers in China are viewed with suspicion because of milk tainting. Which is why exports from Europe and Australia are going through the roof. Powder the milk and sent it over on cargo ships from Icheon to Tianjin.I might also open a semi microbrewery my grand dad when he was in the merchant navy was legendary moonshine maker and sell different non mass produced beer for the niche markets. China has plenty of fizzy piss type beers but not so many ales.If you gave me . mil Id build an indoor skydive tunnel. Asia is severely lacking in them.

4024364,0,t1_crezzln,upads is partially wrong they do identify you as a foreigner as part of their target analysis and that indicates possible higher chance of carrying valuables lots of variables involved obviously.It is common to wear backpacks in front in Guangzhou dont know about other places. For the safest methods that work a necklace pouch for ID cards and most cash then front pockets or waist pack worn on front or side for smaller amounts of cash and phone. Some men also have snugfitting things that look like waist packs but go over one shoulder and under the other. Effective but hardly stylish. Money belts are safe but accessing them is difficult and too sweaty for passports.The pickpockets often work in groups of   or  and sometimes have radio dispatchers perched up high to coordinate not kidding. Once caught a group of  following me down the street. One was directly behind by a bout  steps one trailing closer but to my left and one in front of the pack. The one to my left used lengthy tongs to open my backpack and I supposed if anything had been in there the guy behind would have snatched it then if I had noticed Id need to guess which of the three had my stuff when they all split but they didnt. I turned and stopped and they just stopped and stared and the fourth hoved into view. Im sure if I had done anything in retaliation they would have all been quick to reveal some small blades.Another time  such fellers surrounded me on a crowded bus when it came to a stop the biggest one bumped me hard while one of the others grabbed my wallet from a special zippered pocket in my trousers. I saw them exit the bus wondered why theyd jumped on right after me then gotten off so quickly and then suddenly realized what happened.Locals had been warning me for months about the dangers but none had explained the techniques. After a few failed attempts I thought I could deal with it but only after losing my wallet did I finally understand and never again carry much besides cash although theres the debate about safety of carrying less cash and the ATM card or carrying only cash and no cards at all. I think if a person is here for a year and not living in some green zone theyll get pickpocketed at least once and likely burglarized as well similar frequency in the USA in sketchy neighborhoods but here youre on public transport and often in places you dont even know are sketchy.The interesting part is that these represent the most consistently clever demographic in China in my personal experience. One time a girl with great English started talking some scam to me and I didnt have time but later wished Id heard her out and enjoyed the interaction it was the least boring conversation Id almost had in years as it was mostly offscript compared to what I always hear as a foreigner.I think the eyes in the sky radio dispatched groups of multiple thieves is impressive.

4164596,0,t3_38g74j,Hey OP...first a caveat Im not catholic but I dated one....many many many years ago so my info is both outdated and somewhat removed. but I think Catholicism has a great and long tradition here in China and you should feel free and safe to come and worship as you like. Depending on where you are going to move there are numerous lovely churches and catholic communities.  and while they will be the Three Self churches...so under the ultimate authority of the CCP as opposed to under the churches authority they are a solid community nonetheless.  I will also say the handful of Chinese priests that I have met are all deep spiritual men and have all at least wrestled with the issue of Pope vs. CCP and have come down for now on the side of the Three Self Church. BUT they are still faithfully serving and at least the few services I have attended here in Beijing seem pretty much just like those I would see in the US. Again from the Beijing perspective many of the churches have a pretty healthy community of foreign worshippers who do activities together etc. I believe you can even find some that still have Latin Mass which as an American seemed like a real treat! but maybe in Portugal they still offer latin mass I dunno Some also have an English Mass as well I believe. or at least they did many years ago. anyway feel free to come you will find a community and I think you will be better for the experience.   ,China,cruz1el,1,t5_2qh2v

The big problem is that with the increasing in the Aussie Dollar their exported goods really ceased to be competitive in India Malaysia Indonesia etc.  They peaked at  of their econ as manufacturing and are now below .  Theyve been sliding for awhile fighting Japanese competition since the s but when their dollar was pumped by all their resource exports it really look a hit.  Used to be in that part of the world you bought Australian cheaper than shipping American or European goods to the region when you wanted something quality.  Now theyre just unaffordable in those markets.Same with the service industry the service of Australian lawyers etc now costs more due to their strong dollar so companies farm the work out to other law firms in developing countries who make up for their lower skills with greater numbers and cheaper prices.  Hopefully the Australian government is taking some of the revenue off all these resource exports and sticking them in a sovereign wealth fund so when the good times end they can use the money to expand the manufacturing and service sectors.  ,China,crzxyl9,1,t5_2qh2v

The laws and institutions are set up to function no matter what for the most part though obviously many countries have not succeeded. Democracies still depends on a strong leader to rally the country and the party together if you ever dont follow Australian politics you will see just how an ineffective leader to do to their party regardless if they are in power or not. Just look at how much power the coal industry have on the current federal government to move away from renewable industries and their influence to both major parties via donations lobbyist consultants etc.Laws and institutions are still ineffective if you dont enforce it we see plenty example taking place on a lesser scale compared to China everywhere it is not whataboutism it just human nature and their selfinterest to collect as much wealth as possible when given the power to do so.gt but Im very sure there are many more who are not being caught. They will never catch them all but its a great start considering how much lip services was paid to previous attempt like it or not they caught some pretty nasty ones and parade them around on TV etc. In Chinese we have a idiom called  and it is exactly whats happening now.

Back in the colonial days it was appointed by the UK postUK its buy the BJ. Obviously the s and s was the glory years where HK was in the right place China opening up HK was used as the gateway to leverage the laboursetup shops there and right time everyone else besides Japan was still developing.

The seminars are of course about how to recruit other people into success seminarsget a cut of the profits based on how many people under you under them etc.  A new one is WV or dream trips which is supposed to be some sort of travel club. This one preys on the idea that you can just travel and sightsee while making money because you recruit others into the club.  Personally I think the government turns a blind eye even though they are technically illegal because they keep large numbers of otherwise unemployable people chanting positive quotes and having pep rallies.

4475507,0,t1_csusssp,Good questions! Right now the software is only using one server but this will change depending on loads. The server is in Singapore because mostly because it was fast Right now I log a unique Device ID calculated by one way hashing your Mac address I log the amount of data downloaded by this device ID and the last time this device ID requested something from the server. This stuff is important to this beta test but basically I dont log anything that should identify you. I also dont really care about your IP. And  minutes ago I just finished a counter for downloads of the program. Policy wise I havent thought about it but I guess I wont log anything personal to you I will never seek to profit from any data obtained by you in any way and I will be fully transparent if you ask about howwhat I log. Yes the connections share the server IP when routed through the server that is. So basically your browser communicates with a proxy on your computer loopback and that proxy attempts to retrieve any domain directly without using the server unless its on a list of domains already known to be blocked list is about k domains long. If it doesnt connect within  seconds it will stop trying for the next hour and instead reroute requests to this domain through the server. Your proxy then tells the server what it wants together with its device ID and the communication starts.

4849804,0,t3_3hbcb0,The sudden fall in Chinas currency last week spurred a lively debate about whether the move was a victory for market reform or a competitive devaluation designed to shore up flagging exports.But even those who believe the  per cent drop was aimed at exporters acknowledge that a weaker renminbi by itself is radically insufficient to cope with the challenges facing Chinas economy.Currency depreciation to stimulate export growth is neither useful nor necessary said Qu Hongbin HSBC chief China economist. He notes that while Chinas exports have fallen this year exporters across Asia faced the same challenge suggesting that the underlying problem is sluggish demand in developed markets.Chinas economy officially grew at an annual rate of  per cent during the first half of this year neatly in line with the governments fullyear target. However some doubt that figure  Capital Economics for example reckons it is  per cent  and there are widespread suggestions that further stimulus will be needed to prevent a slowdown. Yet an export revival would boost growth only marginally. Contrary to received wisdom China has not pursued socalled exportled growth for the past decade. Net exports subtracted  per cent from annual growth in Chinese gross domestic product on average from  to . Meanwhile investment contributed an average of  per cent of growth each year.The importance of investment explains why data released last week will keep Premier Li Keqiang awake at night. Fixedasset investment grew at its slowest pace since  in the first seven months of  led by a collapse in property investment. Factory output in July was also barely above the fouryear low touched in March.China economic data for July may have lacked the lethal explosive force of last nights detonation in the industrial city of Tianjin but it laid bare the wider deterioration of domestic macroeconomic conditions Chen Long China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics a Beijingbased macroeconomic research firm wrote last week.Though property sales have begun to inch up following  consecutive months of decline the market remains saddled with a huge overhang of unsold flats. That has caused developers to pull back on new construction hitting demand for basic materials such as steel and cement. Faced with this slowdown factories that produce these commodities are cutting back both on current output and investment in new capacity.Even more distressing are signs that the production slowdown may finally be feeding through to the labour market. Chinas leaders are sensitive to the risk of social instability from a spike in idle workers but they have so far been willing to tolerate four consecutive years of economic deceleration because unemployment remained low. That may now be changing.Chinas official unemployment rate is widely dismissed as unreliable but an index of labour demand based on proprietary survey data from FT Confidential a research service of the Financial Times shows labour demand contracting in July for the first time since . The index hit . last month down from an average of . in the first six months. A reading below  indicates falling demand for workers.Mr Li has repeatedly said China will not resort to heavyhanded stimulus that would boost shortterm growth but exacerbate problems with excess debt and industrial overcapacity. Instead the leadership wants structural reforms to promote a new growth model that relies more on consumption and services.Sticking to that pledge means enduring the pain of an investment slowdown as smokestack industries that thrived under the old model gradually give way to emerging industries such as healthcare education tourism and information technology.So far the government has employed targeted stimulus in the form of fiscal spending on infrastructure while resisting pressure to unleash a wave of lending from commercial banks to the manufacturing sector as in . That stimulus plan led to a quadrupling of Chinas economywide debt from tn in  to tn by mid equivalent to  per cent of GDP. But if the job market continues to worsen pressure for drastic measures will increase. The wild card is deflation. Wholesale prices have fallen for  consecutive months with the decline accelerating in July. Falling global commodity prices are largely to blame for Chinese deflation but that is cold comfort for indebted companies whose nominal cash flows are in decline even as the debt they owe remains fixed.In an illustration deflation is undermining deleveraging efforts Chinas debttoGDP ratio has continued to rise this year even as new borrowing fell  per cent in the first seven months from the yearearlier period. That is because disinflation has caused nominal GDP to slow even more sharply than outstanding debt.Tao Wang chief China economist at UBS said Clearly the overwhelming problem for China remains one of rising deflationary pressures.,China,cu5uqh2,3,t5_2qh2v

But dont forget he also promoted  to teach each according to their abilities and forte yet they were babbling on about We have one system one syllabus one teaching and if you cant keep up you fallConfucius also promoted the idea in short it says doesnt matter who learnt one thing first. The ones who knows the best shall be the one who teach yet the Chinese teachers in the show were all ticked off when their students correct them on some slight errors in their teaching materialand they continue to teach with the wrong formula.You see there the Chinese often babble about tradition and their saints teaching but ultimately what they respect isnt the Saint tradition or anything like thatits power.

4969239,0,t3_3iygju,I think a good way to think about it is in terms of legitimacy.  Legitimacy refers to the governing regimes justification of their rule.  For example many monarchies throughout history relied on the divine right of kings  Elected regimes in constitutional democracies such as the Obama administration derive their justification from the democratic process.  Under Maos China the Partys legitimacy relied on socialist ideology.    Chinese were taught about Marxs theory of history where a civilization moves from slavery and feudalism to capitalism then to socialism and finally to communism.  Mao was portrayed as the ideological heir to Marx and Stalin.  He and his Chinese Communist Party to the people they would implement reforms that would speed historys greatest civilization to communism and even enable them to skip the capitalism stage such that they would surpass Britain and catch up with America in economic performance.Nowadays Chinas leaders still use a little bit of socialist rhetoric and the close relationship between corporations and the government smells a little like central planning.  However legitimacy is no longer derived from socialist ideology.  In other words the Chinese who support their government do not do so because of a belief they will turn the country into a Marxist utopia.  Rather legitimacy is derived from the Partys ability to deliver sustained economic growth which they have done now for over three decades.  However recent economic woes have cast doubt on their ability to maintain the growth narrative.   ,China,cukwrdq,7,t5_2qh2v

4994157,0,t3_3jbsh9,After riding normal bikes of all sizes and some ebikes I think that the smallest possible and lightest weight folding bike is the best for a commuter. If you dont have any other priorities like carrying capacity for heavy shopping then the smaller the better and dont worry about the range it will be as already described  KM for basic battery setups and those will be appropriate for small lightweight bikes.Why small and lightweight? So you can take it everywhere and easily get onto elevators and public transport or even throw it in the trunk of a taxi for emergencies. Hope you have a VPN here is a perfect example of what I mean a video of a foreigner in Shenzhen who has the perfect commuter ebike In case you dont have VPN here is a link to the taobao store where he bought it.,China,cunzd0h,1,t5_2qh2v

British guy offscreen being rational about Japan and pointing out that some of the first people to expose the Nanjing Massacre were actually Japanese journalists getting cut off they try to steer him towards Japan be evil though but he doesnt bite Xis Mao suit. Subtle touch The Belarusian son is cracking me up. He seems to be having a great time. Good on him! Honestly if I was his age and I got to watch some serious military hullaballo I would have been grinning too Some Chinese troops were involved in the Normandy landing. Something I genuinely did not know! Pretty interesting. Im actually enjoying the titbits about the songs Shots of veterans nodding at eachother in approval Jiang Zemin rocking a killer tinted version of his signature look First set of guys taking  steps to commemorate the  years since the start of the first SinoJapanese war its totally about the anniversary of WWII guys I just realised this is the first time I have actually hear Xi give a speech. a decisive battle between justice and evil light and dark preserving Chinas  year old civilization foreign aggressors... foreign aggressors... foreign aggressors  Xi announces cut of  troops  didnt expect that  years Inspection of the troops begins Dat insanely precise metronome marching. Must take so much practice.   actually the most perfect and most Chinese thing Xi could say to the troops. He is killing it today. Also his facial expression. So stoic Something so weird about the hole Xi stands up through in that car. Makes him look a little bit like a cardboard cutout stuck on top. What a monsterous ride too. Much face.

Its like saying that China owned the moon because they had star maps.B  Regardless IF the US were to lose these islands  territory in war they would be lost edit  like Brazos Island.  Its ours now we took itEven if they can claim ownership flimsy it looks like China lost these islands after the first SinoJapanese war.  Then someone moved there and build a fish processing plant.  Thats a precedent there.  Ownership.  His son sold the islands to the afore mentioned rich Japanese family who recently sold them to the Japanese government.It seems simple.

5196203,0,t1_cvcbl4w,i remember that in the end the government paid everyone their ant money because stupidity and greed is subsidized in china.like theres some fund that is failing and a shitload of people are protesting right now demanding their investment and interest... because  interest is totally gonna be risk free.Heres something to recognize RIGHT NOW.Theres a bajillion fucking banks in the country now.  All of them are selling off their bad loans as wealth management things.  All of them are giving loans to whoever the government tells them to even if its a bad loan.  Their NPL standards are not in line with the rest of the world they only count as NPL after several months of failed principal payments interest doesnt count.  And even with those shoddy standards were at  or so.  Seriously go use a platform to transfer money now the bank list is endless.  Not all that long ago there was ONE bank.  Chinese banks are now being pushed to lend to each other to keep liquidity in the system.  In other words the system is fucked at this point.  There is zero trust between the banks they all lie to everyone.  The only trust is that the government will cover all losses as long as they do what the government tells them what to do.There are virtually no more insured wealth management products anymore because not even the insurance companies are willing to give rates that would result in ROI high enough to attract anyone it would be sub at this point and the insurance companies would have to be bailed out if there was any significant failure anyways.Chinese people are dumping their life savings into this crap relying on the interest to live their newly middleclass lives.  See what happens when even one of them starts to go pop?  There are riots over it everyone is to blame except the morons who put their money into it and in the end the government works out something to keep the peace.  Good for them but this is soon going to be trillions of dollars worth of crap that hits the fan.  To bail it out were going to see some insane inflation not to mention moral hazard where the nongs are trained to understand that no matter how risky and stupid the investment the government will pay them back when it fails.There are people who see a  interest and take out a HELOC at  and think they are clever as all fuck for doing it.  The property bubble is about to go again.  They are already starting to try and loosen up the restrictions in the st tier.  This is a direct counter to their claimed stance of limiting population.  The real reason is that the market is deflating.  It also demonstrates a clear lack of understanding of the Chinese mentality.  When restrictions are put into place it jacks up the prices and makes people more desperate to buy on the perception that if they dont act now it will be harder or even impossible to buy in the future.  When restrictions are relaxed however it implies that if the desired effect is not realized more restrictions will be relaxed in the future therefore there is only really downside.  Everyone sells the bubble pops VERY QUICKLY.  There is no such thing as nonrecourse in China.  If you dont pay you are fucked.  In China you are basically required to own a home and a car to get married this is the kind of shit that could start some very serious shit.In short China has been huffing a bag of its own jenkem.  Its overleveraged and the government is more or less out of ideas on how to keep kicking the can.  Limits are being reached on many fronts and the only path they see right now is dogmatic nationalism as a means to staying in power.  The way they are circling the wagons blocking out foreigners increasingly seeing any with any Chinese blood as one of theirs pressing on overseas chinese to act as their agents in espionage and leaning on their families to get what they want.What is coming will be best viewed from the sidelines.  For over a decade I have been a defender of the system here but they have fucked themselves on this one mainly due to greed desperation and fear.  The k military cut is also making some serious enemies the job situation is already grim and k troops mainly officers who were relying on that iron rice bowl and now being kicked to the curb.  Commanders who paid for their positions and are now losing out.  China has ALWAYS been little more than warlords tolerating a central coordinatorleader.  Back in the camapign in the s warlords just got turned into generals and a lot of them who didnt like it sold out to the Japs first chance they got cus they got their fiefdoms back.  Right now there is shit kinda going to hell behind the scenes its bleeding out and the government is trying VERY HARD to cover it up but they are making stupid mistakes.  Xi is doing something right now that... well historically in China never really turns out well.  Theres gonna be not a small amount of blood at the end of this.,China,cvcc47r,5,t5_2qh2v

My argument was that China is exporting an ideology a fundamental shift  that economy and development is the only basis on which nations can interact. Also weve been living with the basic assumption that economics and prosperity flows from liberalization  China is pushing a model that says liberalism is the enemy of development authoritarianism is the key to prosperity.

Military age males are a resource since military age also typically implies suited for other labor.  Educated knowledge workers are a resource which is why governments have education policies.  Marriageable women are a resource.  So are many other classes of of human being.  Its the harsh reality.  Unmarried males leads to social instability.  Poorly educated people means no knowledge economy.  Poor demographics means issues with the social safety need or other graying population type problems such as Japan has.  So on and so forth.  I get shes offended by being considered a resource but its the truth.  Its why lots of governments register all their fighting age males for ease of drafting if needed.  Its why governments try to concentrate their knowledge workers in clusters in hopes of replicating a Silicon Valley in their countryregion.

As an example Ive mentioned Elvis a bunch of times to people here and nobody has ever known who the hell he is even after I show them pictures of him.  Im not a fan of him but hes one of the biggest selling musicians of all time and an easily recognisable iconic performer that everybody should have at least some basic knowledge about.  The same goes for people like Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley  the vast majority of people just dont know they existed.  The Beatles seem to be the only band from the s that everybody here seems to know about.This is not a west vs east thing either since Ive had some pretty cool conversations about older music with Koreans and Japanese with no issues at all.Its simply because China was completely closed off to the outside world from  up until the s and even then the country didnt completely open up overnight.  While a large part of the rest of the world was seeing music trends evolve in front of their very eyes Chinese people never experienced it at all and when they finally had access to the music that was previously banned it was too late for it to be relevant to them therefore seem to have no idea about  of music that was created over  years ago.

In a pinch you can buy imported USNZ ones at places like Shanghai vape if youre in SH however I prefer German ones with higher PG than VG US ones all seem to be higher vg than pg. You can order the German ones online and have them shipped to China. Maybe they would get caught in customs maybe not havent tried.

Once at the tea house they will order some seeminglyreasonable amount of tea and will continue to act nice to you. When it comes time to pay the bill will be something like x what it OUGHT to be but the girls will act as though this is normal and offer to split the bill with you. You fork over a wad of cash because hey the friendly native girls are willing to pay this much so it must be reasonably priced and then leave.The tea house owner then secretly reimburses the girls pays them a commission and they go out and find more gullible foreigners to lure to the overpriced tea joint.

6001924,0,t1_cy6a71t,My worldview has nothing to do with Atheism and that is the central point here. Atheism is a  lack of belief in a deity period. Therefore it cannot be evil it cannot be immoral it cannot be anything it is purely a lack of belief.Jesus if he existed was god in another form sure he felt pain but so what? You can put up with pain many humans have done so but why should I be impressed when a god does so when it knows that nothing can kill it? Plus of course this is purely rhetorical as there is . no proof that Jesus existed and . No proof that gods exist.Which leads to your next point god cannot force anything on to me or any nonbeliever as he doesnt exist. However gods can force actions good and evil onto believers via their beliefs and their belief that what they are doing good or evil is the will of god or ordained. This is how you get good people doing evil things.There are many instances in the bible where murder slavery and other atrocities are carried out and required of those who believe but I havent read anywhere where it says but you dont have to do that anymore. Therefore the requirement to kill witches and practitioners of bestiality is still extant regardless of the separation of church and state. Now while I deplore bestiality I dont think its worth killing someone over and I know several witches and theyre lovely people and much more moral than the average Christian I read about.You cite the  commandments but which ones?Exodus    orDeuteronomy      or perhaps youd preferExodus is radically different and is the only one which the Bible refers to as the Ten Commandments. This is the second set which were given to Moses following the destruction of the first tablets when he suffered from an anger management failure after witnessing the Israelites worshipping the golden calf. While it has a few similarities to the original set it does not include well known rational commandments such as gtThou shalt not steal and gtThou shalt not kill but has instead instructions about holy days not cooking kids in their mothers milk and God expresses a distaste for sacrifices containing honey leaven or both blood and yeast although either alone is apparently quite acceptable. God says Exodus  that this second set was also written on the first pair of tablets so the Ten Commandments from Exodus  are probably not the Ten Commandments at all.This is the list of the new ten commandments in case you forgot Ive noticed many Christians are not very familiar with their Biblegt. Do not worship any other god for the LORD whose name is Jealous is a jealous God.gt. Do not make any idolsgt. Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast as I commanded you.Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv for in that month you came out of Egypt.gt. The first offspring of every womb belongs to me including all the firstborn males of your livestock whether from herd or flock.gt. Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb but if you do not redeem it break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before me emptyhanded.gt. Six days you shall labor but on the seventh day you shall rest even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.gt. Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.gt. Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD the God of Israel.gt. Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning.gt. Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mothers milk.So you see if you do get your morals from the bible you are actually quite free to go around killing people!,China,cy6ds4p,1,t5_2qh2v

It is possible to teach without a computer as unbelievable as that sounds.Yeh Ive had this said to me before after it happened by other foreign teachers and Chinese bosses.But heres a few of issues everyone needs to consider the cirriculum is online. Its an online course. My students are studying an online cirriculum which this college has forked out tens of thousands for. ONLINE. I need a computer that works in order to include the material from this online course as we were ordered to by our Chinese directors.Computer not working? Oh Okay Ill just pop over to the empty classroom next door.....oh darn this ones not working either. Oh Ill try this other empty classroom....no?....Three fing classrooms later and still no computer working which is a big fing deal for a school preporting to being a professional outfit. So then I have to get the IT guy from across the hall to check out the problem only he takes ages while Im waiting. By this time  of the class time has gone.So y see rather than freakthfcuk out and go into one of those CJmodes we all see on here I spare myself the aneurysm and admit defeat send them off to the library. I need the computer to maintain an attendence register and performance grades. This is my way to prevent such situations where habituallyabsent students turn up to the final exam demanding to take the test. It also helps me keep uptodate with student performance on the spot and I can make notes as I go.Doing this by paper is no good as paper registers and notes get lost computer data is a little harder to lose. By computer all the Chinese names are ledgable and clear.gtIt is possible to teach without a computer as unbelievable as that sounds. Its called talking.Yeh no. Its not. My students are lowlevel and cannot speak or understand spokenEnglish. Their English comes from writing not oral and pronunciation which they need. Therefore a computer helps me communicate with the students give them directions for games and activities get them engaged in discussions get them to speak.If I do all the talking theyre just going to get their phone out or fall asleep.If youre one of those teachers who does nothing but talk to the students in a languageaccent they cant understand all the way through the lesson pretty soon theyre not even going to turn up.If theres any breakdown in communcation in my lesson we get onto Baidu or BingGoogle Translate and BANG! were away.I mean whats Chinese for Give me an example sentence with a Present Continuous? Eh? D you know Fella??? Nah me neither. A computer helps me give cultural examples through presentations and media.

6050275,0,t3_3ye85x,Elderly Chinese farmer escapes execution after killing his neighbour and dismembering corpseBeijing  An old farmer was sentenced to death by a court on Friday for killing his neighbour and dismembering the victims body the Beijing Times reports.But the court suspended the sentence for two years which meant he would be spared from execution as the penalty is usually downgraded to a life sentence automatically at the end of the suspension period.Such clemency for a serious crime is unusual in China. The judge of the First Intermediate Peoples Court of Beijing defended the verdict saying the court is now more reserved than ever to sentencing people to death.The yearold farmer had agreed to pay  yuan HK in compensation to his neighbour after his dog bit a friend of the neighbours in the farmers orchard.However he never handed over the money. In February the neighbour came to the farmers house for a drink and discussed the matter. A fight broke out after the two got drunk.The neighbour died after the farmer smashed a DVD player over his head.Instead of reporting to police the farmer dissected the victim and burned the remains in his backyard before scattering the ashes along a national highway.He was arrested by police a month later and charged with murder.The court said the incident was triggered by a small dispute. The accused had confessed immediately after his arrest which showed that he recognised and regretted his wrongdoing. It was therefore not necessary to execute him immediately.The judge whom the report did not name added that the court was extremely cautious on issuing a death penalty to be carried out immediately.Executions with immediate effect are now strictly limited to crimes that severely threaten public security and the verdict echoed to the general tendency to reduce the use of capital punishment across the country.China however remains the leading country for capital punishment. About  people were executed last year more than all other countries combined.,China,cycozo4,3,t5_2qh2v

The willingness of the US to engage in military conflicts in defense of NATO and other defense treaty partners is very different since the cost of not participating is so much greater. It certainly said something about the USs willingness to defend any democratic countrys sovereignty with military action but Russia found a very effective way to obfuscate the issue since there was political instability and the real possibility of a civil war even without Russias action or even if Russia withdrew.If China found a way to create a similar situation in for example northern Vietnam then the Ukraine example might be significant to how the US would react.,China,cze59d8,1,t5_2qh2v

China might have a hard time in the near future with huge public debt and slower than expected growth but its not as if their economy isnt growing and its not as if it doesnt still represent a huge market to tap into.

Littered muddy path around a hill with a huge petrochemical complex in the distance almost hidden by the smog. The fires bursting from some columns make the complex looks like Blade Runner intro scene. On the way back we pass the steel smelting facility and chicken farms. PM Back home I clean the mud out of my wifes shoes and my shoes. I code and read. PM Maternal uncle arrive followed by his wife and his son. The uncle says ni hao to me I say ni hao that will be our conversation for the day. His wife ask if Christmas is like that too my wife answers no its different. Diner is ready. PM Done with the meal with the inlaws and a maternal uncle. Not much talking just downing the food and some baijiu and beer. FIL is drunk so he went sleeping in his bedroom. PM All the family minus FIL is stuffing itself with various kind of seeds on the sofa while changing the TV channel every minute. Me I code and I read. My wife ask me how much we give for her brothers hong bao. I hope tonight I can at last take a shower  days...  no running hot water but we got Wifi ?! and its freezing cold no heating. I try to get a bucket of hot water but MIL make a scene every time telling me I will die of exposure. This night whatever I wash myself. Outside it sounds like a civil war is raging. PM My wife just got .RMB with Weixin hongbao game. The CCTV gala started. They put lots of monkeys plush toys they look really cheap. FIL emerged from his bedroom he looks ok. All pressed against each other on the sofa the cold is bearable. Nobody eat seeds anymore and the fireworks outside completly stopped. PM First scene of the gala really nice. I liked the floating dudes in red suit doing synchronized choregraphies in the background. PM The wife won with the Alipay hongbao game. MIL the wife and me retreated in my wifes bedroom so that we can be comfy on the bed. BIL felt asleep he had too much beer ie. not even a full Snow bottle at the meal. FIL does not join us because he knows his feet smell bad and feels shy about it when Im around. I try to cheer him up and tell him to join us but he declines. The TV gala so far was boring but now there is a song with those famous teenage triplets and extras in super cheesy costumes. PM Nobody really watch the gala anymore. I keep coding and reading wife is reading inlaws are sleeping. PM The army invaded the show with footage of marching soldier and a superduper boring piece of propaganda about patriotism and stuffs army choir... never saw that on CNY gala before. All Glory To The Hypnotoad. I need more beer. . MIL sleeps wife is bored to death her only joy are the hongbaos games on her phone.

What exactly was the benefit?While having a totally different meaning the phonetics are far significantly more similar making more logical sense to have them share the same character. Whether this is actually a net benefit I actually dont know Ill admit that is moot point.gt The traditional character countries have higher literacy rate than mainland China. Yes and? This is a bit of nebulous reasoning that isnt necessarily that accurate either. Going by  numbers Taiwan had a  literacy rate Hong Kong  Macau  Singapore . China came in on average at  just slightly better than HongKong and slightly worse than Singapore. All this says is that complexity of a language doesnt necessarily correspond with literacy rate of a country. A more interesting statistic is the rise from  literacy to  literacy of China over the course of  years. Now obviously this astronomical jump cant be attributed to simplification of characters but the belief is that it facilitates learning to read and write. I reread my post and it came offe wrong. It is not hard science that it helps.gtThe four corner thing is not modern at all. Look at the fonts of Chinese characters in ancient times. They all had the balance. Honestly speaking I have no idea what this four corner thing you are talking about anymore. Do provide an example of this or at least expand on what you mean by balance.gtYes languages are simplified and changes overtime. But those changes come organically according to the needs of that time not through bureaucratic decisions. Lets not forget that the simplification wasnt a goal in itself but rather a stepping stone toward complete alphabetization of Chinese characters. Luckily it was stopped because the third round of simplification was found even more illogical. This is halfright and halfwrong. The writing portion of languages changes can change through bureaucratic decisions or organically and often changes to both Such as the French Academy modernizing French orthography. The spoken language is resistant to bureaucratic changes and changes with the people. ,China,d0zxrdq,-1,t5_2qh2v

7117803,0,t1_d1n3bxt,Anecdotally its very common. Chinese see themselves as more advanced as others. Its even a relatively common belief that Chinese evolved from a more advanced species of manprecursor than other human some believing Chinese are different from other Asians even others believing that Chinese are the original Asian. A lot of it stems from seeing Chinese to be a more advanced culture where western culture is more primitive than Chinese  and that includes smart. Ive had Chinese even tell me things like Westerners like democracy because they have more primitive culture. Someday maybe in a thousand years your culture will be advanced enough and will be clever enough to have Chinese style government.Chinese see themselves as the society who figured out gunpowder while everyone else was still banging together sticks and they think the disparity in advancedness still holds true with a lot of mental gymnastics taken to continue supporting that notion e.g. China only sucks now because of western exploitation it could never have been Chinas own fault and USd exploitation of others is only way weve become best.Btw that IQ by race stuff is bullshit. For example Dutch score right up there with Chinese and Japanese. Given that we dont really even know what IQ is measuring other than generally bright people score higher than nonbright people style and level of education cultural bias testing style socioeconomic status etc. all seem to play a role in IQ scores.Edit Fixed typos from typing on phone.,China,d1n7fmu,13,t5_2qh2v

7132724,0,t1_d1oqdhm,China is rolling out a nationwide system of social control known as grid management in a revival of state presence in residential life that had receded as society liberalised during recent decades.From smogblanketed towns on the North China Plain to the politically sensitive Tibetan capital of Lhasa small police booths and networks of citizens have been set up block by block to reduce neighbourhood disputes enforce sanitation reduce crime  and keep an eye on anyone deemed a troublemaker.The rollout coincides with a broader tightening of state control over civil society and crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping.The grid management system is an attempt by the authorities to reestablish its control over individuals said Li Dun an expert in public management at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The aim is to reinstate the idea of upholding the partys leadership.An earlier system of neighbourhood committees which monitored every urban citizen has declined since the mids as private housing became more common and social controls faded. Grid management also harks back to the baojia system of the ancient Chinese dynasties when groups of neighbours were responsible for mutually enforcing proper behaviour.During a recent journalists tour of Lhasa officials credited grid management for the calm and order in the city. The mass troop deployment that followed a  riot was no longer visible although local residents said the heavy security presence was reinstated during Tibetan holidays or sensitive anniversaries.As well as small police booths that stud residential blocks in Lhasa there are police booths at the entrance to villages around the city as well as much larger checkpoints set up like tollbooths on the roads leading into larger towns.The masses manage themselves and serve themselves this is a Chinese characteristic said Qi Zhala Lhasas party secretary.The system is being introduced relatively late in Guangzhou in the traditionally more freewheeling south. The city plans to hire  grid administrators so each can be responsible for  families. Like many government plans in China the numbers appear to be based on the population of registered residents not the migrants who swell into big cities.If a grid administrator is responsible for  families he can roughly remember who is in his grid in one months time and grasp the basic information of each family in about three months time. In six months time he can count every member of those families Guangzhous mayor Chen Jianghua was quoted as saying by Oriental Outlook a magazine run by Xinhua.He will even have a clear idea of the numbers of migrant workers living in his grid and how much they are paying for their rent Mr Chen said.Many of the armbandsporting neighbourhood watchers in Lhasa are beneficiaries of a national jobs programme. Mr Qi said their deployment had helped Lhasa eliminate zero employment families.If you cant find a job for them in one block you can move them to the next he said.Deng Xiaogang the second most senior Communist party official in the Tibet Autonomous Region said grid management was not being used to keep migrants out of Lhasa but did acknowledge that we might ask to see your ID.Rural migrants from other Tibetan areas are instantly recognisable by their different hairstyles and traditional longsleeved coats and were blamed for the arson and violence of the  riots.One teenage boy from a rural area to the north of Lhasa said he was often stopped by police when he visited the city. They check our ID and sometimes they curse at us he said. Its OK. I can accept being cursed at.,China,d1owtku,5,t5_2qh2v

Here is an article from party mouthpiece Global Times and even they dont say that using VPNs is illegal they say its just a registration issue for the companies. Here is an article about a woman arrested for inciting a riot over Twitter It was blocked at the time and they still didnt charge her for using a VPN. Here is a Quora answer that seems to explain it well. Unless you have some source to the contrary it just seems like youre flatout wrong.AFAIK no one has been arrested for using a VPN. Not foreigners not Chinese.  And you should have more than a bit of common sense you should have some logic and use it. Not everything that is illegal for one party to do is therefore necessarily illegal for the other party to do. Selling drugs is illegal but buying it isnt always illegal. The same goes for sellingbuying sex in some countries. And actually youre wrong it isnt criminal to avoid the law generally speaking unless in doing so you are committing a specific crime. In this case the law is regulations on businesses Consumers generally cant be charged with a crime for purchasing from an unregulated business.,China,d1yf3nd,1,t5_2qh2v

Im not sure if youre ignorant of the history or just sardonic to the point of coming across that way.The KMT was different groups over the course of its lifetime and at one point effectively included the communist party. Sun YatSens role as the founder of the Republic e.g. the predecessor to both Chinas is acknowledged on both sides of the straight. The pejorative aspect of being a warlord is lacking political convictions and being motivated by selfgain. Sun YatSen was highly educated and active as a dissident and revolutionary before becoming involved in any warlike activities and it is those factors that distinguish him from the warlords.And saying that the CCP was in the right place at the right time ignores the fact that they chose the place and made the time. They spent the war cultivating relationships with the people in their area of control while the KMT concentrated not very effectively on cooperating with the Allies in traditional military actions against the Japanese. The CCP entered the civil war with an area under their full control and a body of citizens willing to support them based on their actions during the war while the KMT was left with a ragtag band of beatenup soldiers occupying areas already ravaged by the war.

But its risk was always the government. Right now that risk is front and center and not going away and any market access people are still waiting to get seems very unlikely to happen.Back to the company side they will consider power factors like control of supply chain access to markets obviously strategic positions and so on.

7688718,0,t3_4kmadx,First of all to answer this lets establish the going rate for teaching in China non lichened teacher.Its about  in a T city and about k in a T.  These are people with degrees and an ESL cert around that level thats around a  hour working week allinall.  There are plenty of people who work  teaching hours for around  who are qualified to that level at a private or uni.  They just do it for the spare time and getting private lessons is getting harder and less profitable.Another reason is that the average going rate for a NON degree westerner probably is k RMB at a kindergardenschool.  I know a few buddy recruiters of mine offer around  to a white teacher with no qualifications full working week and  for a black American.  The worst dude I know is a white non degreed teacher who was working for  a month.Next we come to the fact that some of these people are non natives and come from a poorer country in Europe that can be a lot of money to them.  As for other foreigners non teaching I think its pretty insane if you come here for less than  a month but some people do it in other fields too but the likelyhood is much less as the local rate in professional fields is probably about  a month in a decent sized city.,China,d3g5prz,3,t5_2qh2v

Europe is full of them and they are making a killing.Problem is Chinese workers dont have a high enough dedication to create valuable handicrafts and Chinese consumers are not educated enough to enjoy high quality handicrafts for cultural reasons they always go for the cheap alternative.,China,d3g5rom,5,t5_2qh2v

One thing I have heard is that the government doesnt want really common people to know that the same awful corrupt shit that goes on in their village happens across the country they see it as a local problem and if it turns national that could change things. There is also stuff like hiding the fact that lots and lots of money is fleeing the country for instance they will say oh we recovered  billion RMB from corrupt officials who fled overseas effectively hiding the fact that they recovered only  out of the  billion which was taken abroad.But the bigger thing for the government is not allowing organizing online thats why twitter and facebook are blocked. Its not information quite so much but the ability to take action quickly. And by organizing I mean planning to protest.  thousand people on the streets in any city above tier  would be a nightmare for them and remember k is a huge number in Western countries but not in China.The last thing is they have to block everything that would make dear leader cry no one may say any unkind word to nice peaceful developing China so that would be one effect of lifting the blocks.

A feat that not many countries can claim. What is weirdest is that people who perpetuate this hate are the same people who choose to be in China on their own free will!

7940226,0,t3_4o0j2f,Ill ask a couple questions back first. Why do you want to come to China?  Reality may not mesh with your expectations at all.a What do you like to do? hobbies interests etc.b What would you like to do? as a careerThose should drive your choices.  And youll have to make those choices before you come.  Chinas picky about their visas and get more strict with the enforcement.  Its not the kind of place you can legally just come over and then figure out what to do once youre here.  The suggestions to pursue university here are good ones.  It gives you a legal reason for being here and is a very good way to learn both the language and the culture without being thrown into the deep end quite as badly.As for in general?  More than any place Ive seen or heard travelers talk about China is polarizing.  Very few foreigners coast along in the no opinion lane.  They either love it or hate it.  Or like me vacillate randomly between the two with prolonged pauses of hardfought obliviousness in between.    But... youve  got to have a strong will and stronger intestines to survive here.  It can be done though.  I know a few lifers who are doing quite wellbut even they reach their limit at times.ETA  I came here on a fluke as a teacher and an old man and have moved on to head up the marketing department for a joint venture.  So there are opportunities besides teaching.  But you need to build relationships and be lucky.  ,China,d48k0j8,7,t5_2qh2v

8102747,0,t1_d4qn45x,Ah sorry I thought you were another poster. That second comment was totally off point. My bad. I replied over in the unread messages page and didnt check the thread itself.It was stupid because of the economic benefits that come with the union. UK had negotiated a pretty good deal picking and choosing the parts they wanted to be in for while avoiding others.Thats why the pound is falling and this is going to hurt a lot of things like local housing prices will probably fall as well which actually might be a good thing. If they dont reverse course which there is a movement to do that then Scotland could well vote to leave the union they were quite close last time and voted strongly to remain probably again because of the economic benefits.So I am not arguing about your points they are pretty strong actually. There is a point where sovereignty trumps other concerns. But Cameron looks like a total fool now and the entire UK project is in jeopardy and the economic pain will be very real. So overall probably an unwise move maybe they will vote again.,China,d4qtliq,1,t5_2qh2v

8203763,0,t3_4rplzv,A little over a month ago Chinese censorship bureau SAPPRFT announced new rules that require every mobile game launched in China to be preapproved by SAPPRFT alreadylaunched games will have to get retroactive approval before the grace period ends in October. Before the rules had even gone into effect developers and analysts alike were predicting things could be bad and that the rules might dismantle Chinas indie mobile gaming scene entirely.An individual taking on SAPPRFT in courts has about as much chance of winning as a fiveyearold would have of beating LeBron James.Now were barely seven days into the new system and many of those fears seem wellfounded. Developers are already raging against the machine.Case in point one developers rant has gone viral in the Chinese web after their game was supposedly rejected by SAPPRFT for containing English words. Not offensive English words mind you but completely innocuous ones like mission start and warning. Im really fucking surprised wrote the developer of the rejection.Another developer confirmed that their game had been rejected for the same reason including English words like go and lucky. SAPPRFTs rules also forbid the use of traditional Chinese characters.Very soon mobile gaming in China could include a lot less games. Very soon mobile gaming in China could include a lot less games.Developers are also complaining that the process is taking longer than its meant to. SAPPRFTs rules specify that developers should get a response within  days but the first developer whose game was rejected for including English also said that their company didnt get a response from regulators for four months.Another mobile game developer is taking his anger to the next level. Indie dev Chen Yu has told Sixth Tone he will sue SAPPRFT over the new rules. With these new regulations all independent game developers and small enterprises will be driven out of the market with no glimmer of hope for survival Chen said. Abiding by the regulations is simply too difficult and too expensive to make indie game development a worthwhile enterprise.We could be facing a future where Chinas mobile game catalogue consists only of games produced by powerful corporations.Chen has virtually no hope of winning of course  thats something both he and his lawyers agree on. An individual taking on a government body like SAPPRFT in the Chinese court system has about as much chance of winning as a fiveyearold would have of beating LeBron James in a oneonone. Still they say they hope the lawsuit will bring attention and spark a discussion on the new rules and the effect theyre having on the game industry and particularly on indie developers.Chen sees the suit as a potential watershed moment for the gaming industry and it will be interesting to see whether hes right. SAPPRFT has intervened in industries to tighten restrictions many times before but this is the first time in recent memory that new SAPPRFT laws could potentially choke an entire sector of startups and SMEs out of business entirely.Chinas mobile game developers and more importantly Chinese mobile game fans will have to decide if thats something they can live with. Its not clear what any layman could effectively do to limit SAPPRFTs power but if nothing changes we could be facing a future where Chinas entire mobile game catalogue consists only of the games produced by powerful corporations like Tencent and Netease with no room for startups and indies.,China,d530wcx,11,t5_2qh2v

8342762,0,t3_4tukuo,ForecastSouth China Sea tensions will rise in the longterm as China exhausts its nearshore fisheries and continues to push outward to secure further stocks.In Asia consumption of fish will increase with population and industrialization boosting pressure on claimant countries to control their waters.Fishing vessels will continue to spark short sharp crises and risk further upset to the delicate balance in Asias disputed waters.AnalysisChina is pushing outward. The country has made steady moves to reclaim its role as the preeminent power in the Pacific Rim. This expansion however differs from those made at any other time in its history. For most of Chinas existence it was a continental power endowed with sufficient resources with an economy driven by selfcontained markets. External trade was a factor but moved mostly by land primarily via the Silk Road. Sea trade also did occur but Chinas coast was generally a liability  a point of incursion to protect from raiders and hostile powers. China was not compelled to explore the seas and seek new lands.Until recently modern China hewed to this pattern. This began to change by the late s when Chinas economic boom started to strain domestic resources. At the turn of the century imports of key commodities began to outstrip domestic production exports ballooned and China became reliant on maritime transport. The very success of Chinas economic growth brought new vulnerabilities.Because the United States maintains effective control of the worlds oceans this is a difficult move for China. Beijing has opted for a twopronged strategy diversifying away from sea routes with its Belt and Road Initiative and building up its naval strength capacity and reach. But the push to solidify its claims to maritime territory is upsetting the balance of power in the Pacific Rim and challenging a pillar of the U.S.centric world order freedom of navigation.Many WatersChinas reorientation toward the sea is particularly disruptive given Asias geopolitics. Although Europe and Asia share the Eurasian landmass their geopolitics differ fundamentally. Europe a continent crowded with nations vying for space is defined by land borders that ebb and flow like the tides. East Asia by contrast is defined by the sea and ringed by populous coasts a space defined by maritime transit and resources. The sea serves as both the barrier and the pathway between the mainland and the archipelago. Europes land borders might be contentious but they can at least be clearly delineated. Maritime borders are ephemeral and subject to diverse concepts of use and passage.What has emerged is a rising sense of competition and even potential conflict in the South and East China seas driven by fear of losing control of key supply lines competing maritime territorial claims differing interpretations of maritime agreements and competition for resources in these seas themselves. Much has been said about competition over subsea mineral resources from claims of vast potential reserves of oil and natural gas to seabed methane and ocean mining. Although oil and natural gas reserves are actively exploited around the periphery of these seas little significant exploration has been done in much of the contested areas and assertions of a second Arabian Gulf are greatly exaggerated.But there is one very real and actively exploited resource in those waters that is often overlooked fish and other marine foodstuffs. Clashes over fishing grounds are frequent volatile and mostly out of the control of the various regional governments. Given the size of the seas maritime patrols are infrequent. The absence of strong regulation or enforcement allows room for gray areas to be exploited and territorial waters to be violated. Poor regulation and enforcement of boundaries make the security situation even more opaque and complex. Fishermen are both exploited by and exploit nationalist government sentiments and willfully push the boundaries of fisheries. As with the agricultural sector the fishing industry and its countless smallscale producers can have a disproportionate effect on political decisionmaking.Feeding Asian GrowthIn Asia fish and other marine foodstuffs play a greater role in diets than in the West. Seafood production is an important source of employment and a vital component of national economies. Asian fisheries make up half the global total capture production and six of the top  producers of marine products are in Asia.In South Korea and Japan seafood makes up about  percent of the protein supply and contributes more than  percent in Cambodia Indonesia Malaysia and the Philippines. It makes up more than  percent of protein supply in Taiwan Thailand and Vietnam and while it was at around . percent in China between  and  there was a  percent increase in the role of seafood in Chinas national protein consumption. By comparison seafood provides a little over  percent of protein consumption in the United Kingdom a little less than  percent in the United States and less than . percent in Germany.In addition to its important role in national diets and national food security seafood also plays an important economic role. There are an estimated . million fishing vessels plying the waters of the South China Sea alone employing some . million people. And Asias fleets are growing faster than those of the rest of the world. Since the late s the overall size of the worlds fishing fleets has stabilized but the Asian fleet has nearly doubled comprising around threequarters of the worlds powered fishing vessels. In  Asia contributed a third of global seafood exports with China alone accounting for . percent of total global exports up from just  percent in  with the value of Chinas exports growing nearly  percent over the same period. In Indonesia fisheries contribute more than  percent to total national gross domestic product. In other countries the numbers are harder to come by as fisheries are often included with agriculture and forestry in statistics. Many countries in Asia have sizable local fishing communities and as with agricultural concerns these often have a greater political impact than their economic share might suggest.Fish and other maritime products are particularly important to China. After the  economic opening and reform program Beijing actively sought to expand its fishing fleet and activities. Since then Chinas seafood production has grown at a rate of . percent per year making China the largest single producer of seafood in the region and second only to a combined Southeast Asia.The value of the fishing industry in China has risen to . trillion yuan  billion in  with fish now its top agricultural export. There were nearly  fish processing companies in China in  employing  workers predominately in Shandong Liaoning and Fujian. Overall the fisheries and marine foodstuffs industries in China provide nearly . million jobs and China boasted  fishing vessels in  a sharp rise from the  in . Chinese fishermen earn almost  percent more than their farming counterparts and as of  China was spending  billion a year in subsidies to the industry.,China,d5kedym,3,t5_2qh2v

8705064,0,t1_d6tbqxm,Hey say whatever you want about China as you may have knowledge in that area but Nigeria has always been strong at predominantly one sport YouthOlympic level football. That is when the boys are at the peak of their athleticism and they are very hungry for a win. These guys are straight outta the local leagues and play to impress any possible big club scouts at the games so they can be signed and put food on the table. that is why our gameplay can be a little selfish. Its not as comfortable for them as you might assume being used to the level of national investment in sports in more developed nations. How would they afford PEDs when they couldnt even put together a reliable transport scheme for the games??? arrived just  hours before kickoff accommodation troubles the squad captain Mikel had to pay outofpocket for a hotel etc. Nigeria uses PEDs... Did you even watch our matches? players were getting spent a little past the midpoint of the first half...Nigeria is a football nation with plenty of talent. Its just that support and infrastructure is not up to par at the higher levels so once these boys get signed up to a big team they tend not to come back and play for the national team One of many examples Ahmed Musa who replied to each of Messis  goals in the previous world cup Plays for Leicester they little team took the cup played the mighty Barcelona this season and he still replied to Messis  goals scoring the only goals in the match for Leicester. Leicester did not want him to go to Rio and likely offered enough money till he decided not to. even the ones that do tend not to be as initiative and aggressive in their gameplay they do have experience though as they are now used to the clockwork gameplay of big clubs. Motivation is also diminished as one who has been strrugling all his life tends to be carried away by the luxuries of his new club and develpos a new play style and attitude which dosent fit in the national squad. There have been many examples of this even in other sports. Nigerians have the potential to be bigger in most athletics genetically speaking and all that but there just is not enough government investment in sports compared to other countries talk more of investment to the point of formulating and acquiring PEDs. Thats why we dont complain when they do not bring back gold. Our young prospects leave the country as soon as possible to compete for richer countries with better facilities to build a more accomplished career and they cant be blamed for that. Look at most English Middleeastern and some other European black athletes Mostly Nigerian. The talent and physical ability are there in spades Pepe probably recognize this and that was why he made his comment. There are many negative things you can criticize Nigeria for. Governmentsponsored PEDs Governmentsponsored anything really is not one of them. Hell our only gold at Rio was the rower and she SPONSORED HERSELF! Thats crazy. She just popped over won gold and went back to school. If cheating stopped altogether Nigeria would stand out more in track and field events and if there was any significant government investment we would win much more medals.,China,d6trmno,1,t5_2qh2v

The world seems OK with our hegemony. noteWe are fine with Chinas rise so long as it doesnt threaten that.note   Comparatively.gtHistory has left China with a fear of barbarian encirclement and a strong drive to maintain face after what the Chinese regard as a century of humiliation and colonial degradation. The goals that China pursues in the international system today are a direct result of this narrative of Chinese history which the CCP has appropriated to argue that only the Communist Party can realize and restore Chinas pride. In short history and the trauma of the long th century left China selfcentered touchy lonely and seeking respect.gtThese are heightened by the effects of geography and Chinas present condition.

Credit Shanghai Isaac Stern International Violin CompetitionMore than  years after the violinist Isaac Stern made a groundbreaking visit to China his legacy there lives on.gt gt The inaugural Shanghai Isaac Stern International Violin Competition concluded on Friday after nearly three weeks of intensive performances by  young violinists from around the world. Mayu Kishima of Japan was awarded first place taking home the grand prize of  the largest single award for an international violin competition.gt gt We were looking for the kind of spark and commitment to music that our father would have embraced David Stern cochairman of the jury committee said in a telephone interview from Shanghai.gt gt That Isaac Stern who died in  now has a competition bearing his name is somewhat ironic given his aversion to such events.gt gt So when the conductor Yu Long a towering figure in classical music in China raised the idea of holding a competition about two and a half years ago it was not the easiest idea for the three of us to approach Mr. Stern said referring to his brother Michael and his sister Shira. Our father did everything he could to mentor young musicians in order to avoid competitions.gt gt Isaac Sterns dedication to training young musicians was perhaps most vividly captured in the  documentary From Mao to Mozart Isaac Stern in China. The film which won an Academy Award for best documentary feature chronicled Mr. Sterns twoweek trip to China for a series of concerts and master classes.gt gt That visit which came just as China was emerging from decades of selfimposed isolation and political tumult is credited with having influenced a generation of young Chinese musicians including Mr. Yu who recalled sitting in the audience as a teenager during one of Mr. Sterns performances in Shanghai.gt gt During the Cultural Revolution we didnt have many opportunities to play Western music Mr. Yu now conductor of a number of ensembles including the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra said in a telephone interview. Then in that moment in  when Maestro Stern came we suddenly felt the difference in how we could understand music.gt gt Since  classical music in China has grown tremendously with gleaming concert halls being built around the country and some  million young Chinese studying the violin or the piano.gt gt Still Mr. Yu said The problem in China and Asia more broadly is that the players are more concerned about technical issues.gt gt So when it came to this new project both the Stern family and Mr. Yu agreed that they wanted to make a more comprehensive competition that would reward musicians not just for technical ability but also for allaround dedication to music.gt gt After two years of discussions and planning the Stern family and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra came up with a competition structure that David Stern said his father even with his distaste for competitions probably would have approved. This meant including elements that were important to Isaac Stern like chamber music and Chinese music.gt gt For example contestants in the semifinal round were required to perform two concertos The Butterfly Lovers a popular Chinese concerto composed in  by He Zhanhao and Chen Gang and Mozarts Violin Concerto No.  with a chamber orchestra with original improvisation during the cadenza section. They also had to play a violin sonata as well as the first movement of piano trio by Schubert or Brahms.gt gt The  contestants represented several countries including China France Germany Japan South Korea and the United States. In addition to the prize money Ms. Kishima will also receive performance contracts with several international symphony orchestras.gt gt Sergei Dogadin of Russia was awarded the second prize of  and Sirena Huang of the United States took home the third prize of . The violinists Zakhar Bron of Russia and Boris Kuschnir of Austria were among the  who sat on the jury.gt gt The competition also presented an Isaac Stern Human Spirit Award of  each to two noncontestants One to Wu Taoxiang and Du Zhengquan who founded the Einstein Orchestra a middleschool ensemble in China and the other to Negin Khpalwak who directs an orchestra for women in Afghanistan for their outstanding contribution to our understanding of humanity through the medium of music.gt gt Most of the funding for the competition which will be held every two years came from corporate sponsors according to Fedina Zhou president of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. The symphony has been expanding in recent years forging a longterm partnership with the New York Philharmonic and in  unveiling a new hall where the competition was held.gt gt For many musicians and music lovers in China the competition represents further validation that China is well on its way to becoming a heavyweight player in the classical music world.gt gt At last the Chinese people finally have an internationally recognized competition of their own said Rudolph Tang a writer and expert in Shanghai on the classical music industry in China. It has everything that a top competition should have like a top jury great organization and high prize money.gt gt It is like a dream come true he added.,China,d7a5bxa,1,t5_2qh2v

The parallels with Japan that we have both made go deeper than we think as there was a large upsurge in Japanese hard asset purchases and factory ownership back then. We now know that this was in part because Japanese companies knew that they would need the US market in the future.I point this out because it seems to contradict the narrative of a Chinese Consumption Economy that will supply all its own demand and wont need anyone else thats being pushed by nationalists.Their assets being in a place isolated from CCP fuckery including bullshit stateowned company favoritism is a bonus.,China,d7g92r6,2,t5_2qh2v

I wont lie though its kinda nice to completely obliterate people in terms of who can drink the most.

You think NK is going to be able to use SK like a punching bag and the  UNUS Japan will just sit on their hands?  Jesus. Have you been watching what has been happening in MENA for the last  years? The US has stepped up to and stepped on all challengers. China? There is absolutely no upside for China to get involved if NK goes off the reservation.  And dont forget Russia. My point is that NK is just following a script provided to them by China. Everything else is just noise.  Otherwise if NK was truly going off script and China was actually worried about it they have numerous levers to pull in order to rein in NK.  But hey they arent doing much in that area are they?  Why is that?  Because China is using NK as a proxy to engage the West from a different angle.I am cutting down on the ellipses.

Focus more on how to excel within the current set of rules not on crying about things that many others already know arent worth the tears.

9986518,0,t3_5im3wz,Chinas digital dictatorship  Worrying experiments with a new form of social controlWHEN communism crumbled in the Soviet Union  years ago this week the Chinese Communist Party seemed to many to be heading irreversibly downwards. Yes the tanks had left Tiananmen Square after crushing a revolt in  but the war appeared lost. Even Chinas breakneck growth which took off a year after the Soviet collapse looked likely only to tear the party further from its ideological bedrock. In  President Bill Clinton intimated that he foresaw an inevitable democratic trajectory. He told his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin that China was on the wrong side of history.Yet while the West has suffered from the financial crisis and the fallout after a failed attempt to implant democracy in the Middle East Chinas Communist Party has clung on to its monopoly of power. Its leaders behave as if China will never have to undergo the democratic transformation that every rich country has passed through on the way to prosperity. Instead they seem to believe that the party can keep controland some officials are betting that the way to do so lies in a new form of digital dictatorship.A party apartUnder its leader Xi Jinping the party looks from the outside to be stronger than at any time in decades. Since Tiananmen stale apparatchiks have been replaced by bright technocratsand even entrepreneurs. Citizens enjoy freedoms unimaginable a generation agoto do business to travel abroad and to pursue freewheeling lives. Using Western techniques of public relations the party reminds ordinary Chinese how everyone thanks to mass consumerism is having a jolly good time.And yet the party is still profoundly insecure. During the past few years it has felt the need to impose a fierce clampdown on dissidents and their lawyers. It is bullying activists in Hong Kong who challenge its authority and is terrorising restless minorities. Rapid economic growth has created a huge new middle class who relish the opportunity to get rich but who are also distrustful of everything around them of officials who ride roughshod over property rights of a state healthcare system riddled with corruption of businesses that routinely peddle shoddy goods of an education system in which cheating is the norm and of people whose criminal and financial backgrounds are impossible to assess.The party rightly worries that a society so lacking in trust is unstable. So it is experimenting with a striking remedy. It calls this a socialcredit system see article. It says the idea is to harness digitally stored information to chivvy everyone into behaving more honestly whether flybynight companies or tax and finedodging individuals. That sounds fair enough. But the government also talks about this as a tool of social management ie controlling individuals behaviour. This is a regime that already tries to police how often people visit their parents. How much further could it go? Citizens ratings are to be linked with their identitycard numbers. Many fear that bad scores might result in sanctions such as being denied a bank loan or permission to buy a railway ticket even for political reasons. They have reason to worry. The government decreed this year that the system should record such vaguely defined sins as assembling to disrupt social order.In the West too the puffs of data that people leave behind them as they go about their lives are being vacuumed up by companies such as Google and Facebook. Those with access to these data will know more about people than people know about themselves. But you can be fairly sure that the West will have rulesespecially where the state is involved. In China by contrast the monitoring could result in a digital dystopia. Officials talk of creating a system that by  will allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.So far the scheme is only experimental in about  areas. The government itself seems unsure how far to take it. There has been much debate about how to ensure that citizens can challenge their ratings. Indeed attempts to use the system to give the party more muscle are meeting opposition. Official media have reported misgivings about one experiment in which citizens visiting government offices to complain about miscarriages of justice were punished with poor scores. The media have even quoted critics comparing such tactics to the Japanese handing out good citizen certificates to trusted Chinese during the imperial armys hated wartime occupation.That the party has given publicity to such concerns suggests it may heed some of them. But it is just as likely that the experiments mark the beginning of something bigger and more sinister. They are of a piece with Chinas deepseated bureaucratic traditions of coercion and paternalism. The government feels that it has a right to intrude on citizens lives. Public resentment has made no difference to brutal illjudged efforts to dictate how many children families can have. Whenever Mr Xi is challenged his instinct always seems to be to crack down. The routine succession of threats any government faces is more likely to lead to oppression than to a free informed debate or a decision that the state should forsake the digital tools available.Turn the spotlight on the rulers not the ruledInstead of rating citizens the government should be allowing them to assess the way it rules. Vast digital systems are not needed for that. For all democracys weaknesses the ballot box can still work. Too much to ask for in China perhaps? Not if the government is to be taken at its word. Its outline of the socialcredit scheme grandly calls for complete systems to constrain and supervise the use of power and steps to broaden channels for public participation in government policymaking. That sounds a lot like democracy.Sadly Mr Xi shows little interest in experiments of that kind. Witness the thugs who were recently deployed outside the home of a Beijing citizen who dared to try to stand in a local election without the partys permission. Instead Mr Xi continues to develop digital tools and systems for controlling people. That will fuel anger and resentment towards the government. In the long run it will prove that Mr Clinton was right.,China,db99s3n,8,t5_2qh2v
9986568,0,t3_5imaaq,For Chinas highly leveraged real estate developers  could be the year that the borrowing binge finally catches up with them.Regulators have choked off a key source of funding with the Shanghai Stock Exchange raising the threshold for property firms to sell bonds on their platform in October. Since then builders havent sold any notes in a market that played host to about  percent of their onshore debentures over the past two years data compiled by Bloomberg show. The curbs couldnt have come at a worse time with a record . billion of developer bonds due next year and another . billion in .Chinas government is treading a fine line with the curbs on debt issuance as it tries to gently deflate the realestate bubble while avoiding wider fallout in an industry that accounts for as much as  percent of Asias largest economy according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The sector is also threatened by a broader increase in funding costs with the yield premium on AAArated domestic corporate notes reaching the widest since July  amid a global pullback in bonds and targeted central bank steps to stem leverage.Smaller developers will be the hardest hit with bigger players still able to sell exchangeregulated bonds according to NN Investment Partners.Overall funding conditions will become more challenging in  said Clement Chong senior credit analyst in Singapore at NN Investment. Only stronger developers can issue onshore bonds subject to a number of conditions. But smaller builders will be forced to come to the offshore market to issue bonds which will be subject to regulatory approval.But even outside of China the environment is becoming more challenging.The average yield on dollardenominated bonds from Chinese developers and other Asian highyield issuers jumped by  basis points last month to . percent the steepest increase since September  JPMorgan Chase amp Co. indexes show. Banks are charging more to lend to builders offshore with their average loan margins this year climbing seven basis points to a threeyear high of  basis points Bloombergcompiled data show.Government efforts to thwart capital outflows also make it more difficult for Chinese developers to get money offshore to make overseas bond repayments said Sun Binbin a fixed income analyst at TF Securities Co. in Shanghai.The curb in refinancing will certainly increase Chinese developers debt burden he said. Its hard to predict when Chinas exchanges will resume property bond sales.The yuans  percent retreat this year has made both Chinafocused developers and regulators nervous about offshore debt. Approval from the foreignexchange watchdog is now required for early prepayment of overseas loans even for amounts less than  million the European Union Chamber of Commerce said in an email Thursday. These restrictions come just as Chinese builders need to repay  billion of offshore loans next year the most in five years data compiled by Bloomberg show.While house prices continue to rise in many big Chinese cities government buying curbs are starting to bite. Thats contributed to  bankruptcy filings by real estate companies according to an official website set up in August the worst of any industry.Regulators have also limited the ability of wealthy individuals to channel money into overheated property markets. Issuance of trust investments for realestate projects slid  percent from September to . billion yuan . billion in October the most since February according to research firm Use Trust.  The property market was so strong for much of this year so from the liquidity standpoint developers are in decent shape said Karl Choi head of Greater China real estate research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.It also depends on how long the funding window continues to be shut he said. The longer this window remains closed the more it favors financially stronger players.,China,db9a0jd,1,t5_2qh2v

And as I said why would the Chinese gov even waste time and money to seize meth shipments if they are the ones behind it all?Free press nowadays is basically social media which is absolutely rife with fake news. That is why even Obama said he is concerned about misinformation being spread online. So while mainstream media is sensationalist clickbait you also have websites like Breitbart News that spreads hateful dogma or something like that. Most journalists arent even experts or academically knowledgable in the articles and topics that they write. Snowden is wanted in the US because he revealed that US gov spies on its own citizens. This threatens US national security and stability. In the same way China censors information that threatens the security or stability of China. They also consider media criticism to threaten their national security. I dont see a problem really. All countries are different.,China,dbemzjc,1,t5_2qh2v

Sadly the reputation that many of the losers here have laid make it harder for decent people to break through in situations like these.She is probably interested. But she is probably testing your persistence. If you are really persistent not pushy persistent then she will probably feel safe that you want more than a casual relationship and eventually relent. The other advice is good here about the little WeChat messages Id also do things like bring in small snacks and the occasional milk tea for her.Because of the situation she is likely to say no more times than is normal... and of course you are expected to be a mind reader and determine if it is a legit no or if she is testing the depth of your interest.She may not be interested in you but Id say persist again not push a little more.

I guess its a step in the right direction but only technically. We are doing that research and I have no doubt that we will come up with some sort of solution that actively combats the problem rather than just mitigates some of it. The issue is that with Trump freezing funding towards that research we may not come up with a viable solution before it is too late. It may be the case that we do not need to limit our reliance on fossil fuels at all for the foreseeable future we just need to build a few big catalytic converters or release genetically engineered algae but without the relatively miniscule amount of funding this science needs to continue we are fucked.,China,dcwqr1o,3,t5_2qh2v

By any notion of international law even if the sea did belong to China the US has the right of innocent passage up to that  mile line from the shore. And by pushing those ships through there regularly its a clear message to China nope you cant take this shit by force. We wont let you. Meanwhile official position was we will just follow international law and they didnt say SCS is or isnt a part of China until the tribunal made a clear statement that international law does not recognize Chinas right to the claim.All of this made China effectively powerless other than putting some military infrastructure up of which has dubious capability and bitching about it in their state media.

Science is not behind anything because science is not a world view its a process.  And if you had bothered to study the history of science youd see clearly through many examples that arrogance and certainty both individually and together illbecome the scientific enterprise.  Its not behind atheism because its not behind anything.  What supports most forms of atheistic belief however is unbridled and unhinged scientism.  Scientism works through vain appeals to authority credential fetishing the selfrefuting paradox of scientific consensus and all manner of other related unscientific and psuedointellectual garbage that passes for stimulating discourse in the Starbucks of the world these days.  Atheists are believers who either havent thought through their beliefs very carefully or who havent had sufficient life experience to have yet encountered something that didnt fit mechanistic or materialistic dogma.

Well put.Explains the chabuduo constitution.gtXi Jinping has after all stepped even if opportunistically into the role of standard bearer for globalization. His unapologetically globalist Davos speech played well at home. And if nationalism has an opposite number today it is globalism.But doesnt that just go to the previous point?  That Xi Jinpings support of globalism is really only as a tool for nationalistic gain money and power?

I dont know exactly how taxes work with being an American citizen abroad but it sounds like youd be doing better financially than I would be working in finance in NYC! The idea of saving k actual american dollars per year is something that is not possible in most places in America because of the much higher cost of living despite the higher salaries.What youre describing for the job is basically exactly what I want  something with a bit of dignity that doesnt take up too much time that will allow me to save money while doing something interesting. I am especially impressed by the fact that your coworkers are so great  do you think many expats have a good experience with their direct coworkers rather than their boss?Having previously lived in China for  months albeit in Shanghai I have a bit of a sense of the sort of behaviors that come off as especially strange to Americans and they usually dont bother me much. Except of course for those really puzzling ones that hocking globs of lung saliva directly onto the floor in a restaurant. The seminecessity of drinking is something I think I can adapt to even if I know Im not going to have much success enjoying it.If you dont mind me asking how specifically did you find your job?

Im still not clear on how SK has been a major victim unless you consider their security against NK but then it gets confusing because you could say they are indirectly under Chinas thumb through NK? Nonetheless the stability of the NK peninsula as a whole today can definitely be attributed to bad Chinese management.The reason the Korean peninsula is still divided today can be traced to several different countries mainly Soviet and American conflict e.g. splitting of Korean peninsula as well as Japanese aggression in the s. The Chinese were not really eager to enter the Korean war and fight America in the first place. The reasons they did were because of Soviet encouragement American protection of Taiwan Mac Arthur provocations etc. Without the Japanese invasion of China its likely KMT would have maintained control over China which would have meant China would never have intervened in the Korean War at least not on the Soviet side.Edit I would definitely prefer to not argue or limit it and I agree that continued existence of NK tensions today is mainly the fault of China. I just wanted to point out that the existence of NK this is probably confusing cannot be blamed mainly on the Chinese.,China,dezp8vv,-1,t5_2qh2v

11266139,0,t3_60spks,Among financial geeks the repurchase market is seen as the lifeblood of a monetary system. Without it banks cant really operate.Chinas seized up on Tuesday prompting the Peoples Bank to perform an emergency cardiac massage. Other regulators in Beijing may want to look on closely because they may be called upon to undertake a similar maneuver shortly.To understand what happened in Asias largest economy its important to know how banks operate. Every so many hours institutions tally up how much cash is coming in the doors and how much is going out. Unlike in the textbooks this never nets out at zero. Enter the repo market. Banks with excess cash lend it to those that are short at a friendly interest rate. The borrrowing bank also deposits some securities in treasury for the lending institution as a guarantee it will return the money tomorrow.That kind of arrangement happens even when the central bank is the creditor. Remember when the U.S. Federal Reserve said Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. didnt have collateral to be used for additional liquidity when it let the investment bank collapse back in ?CHINA GOVERNMENT FIVEYEAR BONDS YIELD.Bankers are a suspicious lot by nature and they suspect each other more than anyone else. When a rare default happens they start hoarding cash even if they know they can get their money back by selling some of the securities that were pledged. Thats whats happening now in China.Chinas central bank on Tuesday injected hundreds of billions of yuan into the financial system after some smaller lenders failed to make debt payments in the interbank market people familiar with the matter said. The interest rate on overnight borrowings soared  basis points from a week ago to . percent making the yield to borrow for a single day higher than the . percent fiveyear Chinese government bonds pay.MadnessChinas repurchase rate curve has taken an odd shape with the cost of twoweek money rising steeply to become now pricier than sixmonth cashSource Bloomberg Snap shot as of pm EST March  That should normalize after a few liquidity injections  after all nothings more comforting than knowing the central bank has your back. This time however it may be more complicated particularly if the missed payments are the start of a trend.On Tuesday it also transpired that the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp. which oversees exchangetraded notes plans to allow financial institutions to use only AAArated company securities as collateral for shortterm loans. In China banks tend to be a bit more generous than their Western counterparts which typically only accept their own governments debt as collateral.THEYRE ALL GOODOne of the most recent times regulators tightened repo regulations was in December  and the bond market pretty much froze. Then banks were told they could only accept bonds rated AA or higher. Thats since become something of a moot point Thanks to the financial discipline of Chinese borrowers about  percent of corporate debentures can be used as a guarantee for interbank borrowings.The new requirement means at least half of these securities will no longer qualify. Whether that played a part or not in this weeks interbank defaults isnt clear. But you can bet it will in future.,China,df900zy,5,t5_2qh2v

Critics say some of the measures are expensive too shortterm and come with massive hidden costs.On World Water Day held by the UN annually since  to promote the availability of clean fresh water to all people worldwide we examine three major ways China is helping to solve its water crisis.Shaying River in Henan Province a branch of the seriously polluted Huaihe River.Shaying River in Henan Province a branch of the seriously polluted Huaihe River.Moving the riversChinas most spectacular water project has been in the works for years.Its an idea borrowed from Chairman Mao Zedong the strongman founder of the Peoples Republic.The countrys south has lots of water the north has less if it were possible it could borrow a little Mao said in  according to the South to North Water Diversion projects website.In December   years after Maos initial pronouncement water from Chinas south began to flow into Beijing hundreds of kilometers to the north as part of a enormous canal built from Danjiangkou Dam in Hubei all the way to the capital.The eastern route had ferried more than . billion cubic meters of water from Chinas wetter south to the arid north up until November   the projects website said.By the time all three routes are finished  eastern central and western  it could cost more than  billion.Its gone a way to solving the water shortage  but experts doubt it is a long term sustainable solution to Chinas problems.Ma Jun the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs director and prominent environmentalist told CNN the immense project had only given northern China a lifeline of water in the short term.Laborers work on a construction site in September  for the SouthtoNorth Water Diversion plan in central Chinaamps Henan province.Laborers work on a construction site in September  for the SouthtoNorth Water Diversion plan in central Chinas Henan province.But first we need to recognize that this is not coming without a cost and it is a high cost  environmental and social. And even then it is not enough he said adding a Western link was still being built at great cost to the environment.Ma said it was possible the massive longanticipated project had even led northern Chinese water consumers to overuse their resources always confident of the imminent flood from the south.Its not a long term sustainable solution ... we need to take advantage of this period of time and try to truly switch our priorities from the expansion of supply to conservation he said.Inside some Chinese cities conservation plans are already underway.South to North Water Diversion seen on November   in Zhengzhou Henan province of China.South to North Water Diversion seen on November   in Zhengzhou Henan province of China.Changing the citiesToo little water isnt always a problem for Chinas northern urban centers.In July  Beijing flooded along with the nearby provinces of Hebei Henan and Shanxi  all in Chinas dry north. More than  people went missing.Just four years earlier also in July  people were killed when Chinas capital filled with water after a torrential hour downpour.A man rests by his destroyed home in the devasted area of Beijing in July  after severe flooding.A man rests by his destroyed home in the devasted area of Beijing in July  after severe flooding.Rapid urbanization and poor city design has left Chinas cities prone to flooding leaving important rain water useless and at times dangerous.The citys infrastructure basically cannot cope with the runoff ... you pave the entire city with concrete so once the water hits the ground it has nowhere to go but down the drainage says Xuemei Bai a professor of urban environment and human ecology and Australian National University Professor.Beijing residents face costly pollution fight Beijing residents face costly pollution fight But what if the water could be turned into reusable resource?China is experimenting with innovative urban design to solve flooding and water shortages. Theyre called sponge cities.Porous concrete manmade wetlands and green spaces capture and reuse water that previously would have vanished down the drain.Its much more economic as well  if you try to upgrade your sewage infrastructure that could be quite expensive but then if you use this Sponge City concept typically the cost will be  of that Bai said.In April  the Chinese government announced  cities and districts which would test the sponge city program with a goal to use up to  of rainfall.Bai said already more than  billion . billion yuan had been spent on the project.But no amount of drinking water will help China if it totally unusable due to pollution.Cleaning the swampsWidespread water pollution is making Chinas water shortage even worse.Already limited supplies of fresh water in Chinas north are growing increasingly polluted from industry and urbanization.In fact according to official government statistics more than half of northern Chinas groundwater is currently undrinkable because of pollution.In April  a major action plan was announced by the State Council to tackle water pollution  the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan or Water .It was a broad plan focused on specific polluting industries and gave targets to be met by  and  for water quality across the country among other initiatives.Ma said the plan could help clean Chinas water  if its enforced properly.We still have many factories which cannot comply with basic water discharging standards ... They will still need to find ways to fully enforce the plan he said.Ma said local governments were carrying out the easier more obvious aspects of Water  rather than tackling more complex issues  for example cleaning up small trashfilled urban rivers rather than tackling drinking water problems.A resident clears dead fish from the Fuhe river in Wuhan in September  after they were killed by high levels of ammonia.A resident clears dead fish from the Fuhe river in Wuhan in September  after they were killed by high levels of ammonia.But others were more positive  China Water Crisis Director Debra Tan told CNN penalties and factory shutdowns had increased in the new policys wake.Penalties collected last year are over  billion yuan  million up  year on year and over  companies had to either shut down or halt operations she said.Tan said polluting textile factories had been the hardest hit by the Water . Enterprises have shut down she said.Hope on the river HuaiPhotojournalist Huo Daishan told CNN he had returned to the Huai River of his childhood years ago to shoot its natural beauty  instead he found it filthy and polluted.Hed grown up on the river and was stunned to see it so polluted that the fish were left deformed.Huo Daishan R shakes hands with Philippine President Benigno Aquino on August   during a ceremony honoring him for his environmental work.Huo Daishan R shakes hands with Philippine President Benigno Aquino on August   during a ceremony honoring him for his environmental work.Now the rivers strongest advocate he has pushed the local government to clean up the Huai.

People talk about crashes as being bad things but really they just drain the bad blood from the system.

You currently do not have a job in China after May that allows you to legally stay in China.Are these points correct?If they are correct I need to ask Do you recognize some a problems in character and responsibility that your wife may have as evidence by the plan to leave her new baby for a year? What is your wifes idea of how the baby should be taken care of during her travels? Who should be taking care of the baby and where?  Are you going along with her plan?
