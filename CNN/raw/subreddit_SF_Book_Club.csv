2032688,0,t1_ckxkwq3,Its not just the narrative mirror one could arguably describe the outline of both books in the same wayAn unreliable and seemingly impotent narrator travels as an observer in a spaceship to meet an alien or aliens accompanied by and manipulated by a vampire and a group of modified humans a soldier a translator and a scattered personality. The vampire may or may not be in charge of the whole operation.,SF_Book_Club,cky76qb,8,t5_2rzkm
2034676,0,t1_cky9w06,gt My only disappointment with Echopraxia was that it spent most of its time in the Oregon desert and in space only lightly touching on events in the wider world. Your portrayals of future Earth  zombie presidents Vatican communiques the inscrutable Moksha Mind Realist terrorists paranoid gylands the WestHem panopticon  is so intriguing and the nonsentient uprising teased at the end of Blindsight is chilling. Consider this a vote for further fleshing out s society and exploring how it might fall whether its at the hands of the vampires or a Portiainfected Bruks. End of the world fiction is sadly so hot right now.Well if I do write a third volume Im pretty much compelled to keep it on Earth if for no other reason than thematic symmetry.  The first book went outwards the second went inwards the third has to just hover at the midpoint in order to keep the mirror in balance.Might not go over so well though. People seem to like my shipinabottle stories better than my bigwideworld ones. Starfish was a hit and it was claustrophobic and selfcontained.  I showed the wider world in Maelstrom and a lot of folks found that book too well messy. Just like reality Id argue.gtHow well were you served this time around in terms of support promotion and other behindthescenes stuff?Better than Blindsight was served certainly which is admittedly a low bar to clear. They did a bunch of EchopraxiaUltraThinMan giveaways. Commissioned The Colonel gave me their Tor Author Pop Quiz posted a rave but hardly unbiased review at Tor.com passed on thirdparty requests for email interviews that kind of thing. And lets not forget I got a much better cover this time around.As far as I can tell they didnt really push the title though nothing that involved laying out a budget I asked them about a book launch which has always happened in the past and they blew me off. I dont know if they advertised it or anything. They didnt put any blurbs on the cover except for one I hand fed them which is kind of odd given how many good reviews Echopraxia has got from the usual suspects.  None of this surprises Im just another midlist author after all and publishing is a business like any other. You put your money where you expect the greatest return.Also as Ive mentioned elsewhere I was told explicitly that any kind of active promotion was unlikely as long as I insisted on a title that people in Marketing wouldnt be able to pronounce. I was open to alternatives but I couldnt come up up with one that worked on multiple levels the way Echopraxia does and neither could Editor  and to give her credit she let me keep the Eword despite her misgivings.  I do think its the best title for the book and its not as though Tor was about to run second ads for State of Grace during the Superbowl anyway but I acknowledge that more people might be buying  the thing if it had a twosyllable title.Im pretty sure though that those extra people would have stalled out before page ten.  If the word Echopraxia on the cover scares you off youre not going like any of the words behind it.,SF_Book_Club,ckygaa9,6,t5_2rzkm

3550470,0,t1_cpwordj,Good question. A full answer would take pages and pages so heres an abbreviated version. Censorship in China is an incredibly complicated subject. The relevant regulations are vague and open to interpretation and what is tolerated or not tolerated can change on a daily basis. The kinds of things that are most heavily censored may also surprise some Westerners  e.g. overly patriotic statements. The sort of criticisms that can be voiced depends on the speakers position as well as the size of the audience. Different rules apply to TV and film as opposed to literature.Writers and editors generally engage in quite a bit of selfcensorship to avoid trouble but the extent of such selfcensorship varies. Someone whos very sensitive to the shifting political winds will be able to figure out exactly where the line is and push right up against it others will stay far away from sensitive topics.This particular post by Ilya Somin who visited China as a legal scholar is pretty good at describing the complexities of living under this system.Liu Cixin himself has said that he does not believe that his own work is very political and he deemphasizes the effects of censorship on his own work.TTBP presents an interesting example. When it was first published the Cultural Revolution chapters were moved to the middle of the book because it was around the time of the th anniversary of the end of the Cultural Revolution and such topics were deemed sensitive but the chapters werent deleted.Also Fangzzz is generally right that criticism of the Cultural Revolution is not some forbidden topic in China. The form of the criticism is tricky however. Some ways of criticizing the Cultural Revolution are okay and others are not. And the differences between them can be very subtle unless youre steeped in the political history and contemporary politics of China.Without disagreeing with Liu Cixin explicitly I will say that there are some works of his that have not been brought out by publishers  though they can be found on the Web if you know where to look. Whether these works are too sensitive to be published in China is something I leave to individual readers to decide.Liu Cixin has also said that writers of scifi generally have less trouble with censorship than filmmakers  based on my own observations I think hes right.,SF_Book_Club,cpwz678,18,t5_2rzkm

7424220,0,t1_d2ljavm,gtThis is the way the world ends. Again.  gtThree terrible things happen in a single day. Essun a woman living an ordinary life in a small town comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile mighty Sanze  the worldspanning empire whose innovations have been civilizations bedrock for a thousand years  collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madmans vengeance. And worst of all across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  gtNow Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly dying land. Without sunlight clean water or arable land and with limited stockpiles of supplies there will be war all across the Stillness a battle royale of nations not for power or territory but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. Shell break it herself if she must to save her daughter. ,SF_Book_Club,d2m3318,2,t5_2rzkm
