782191,0,t3_233vbt,Become a university employee and get a facultystaff pass then you can park virtually anywhere AND it is sadly cheaper than most of the parking passes you can get as a student.In reality though once upon a time might still be the case you could get a  day visitor pass to park in the ferg parking garage for a small fee. I dont know if the other ones offer such a thing as well but if so that might be one way to get closer to your building on occasion.Be glad that youre getting out now. The popular rumor is that within the next  years they plan on eliminating whats left of roadsparking inside the campus borders and making it almost exclusively a walking campus,capstone,cgt6t86,2,t5_2slr8

1443965,0,t1_cix61bk,One thing to think about as far as football season goes youll get  football seasons either way unless you graduate early.  However if you start in Spring by your senior Fall semester youre going to have  more credit hours than most seniors meaning youll have an advantage for getting away tickets including postseason tickets.That being said a lot of friendships are made Fall semester freshman year Im not sure thats worth giving up.  There are enough people here that youre going to make friends no matter what but I feel like people are more open to forming social circles their first semester and then tend to not branch out as much afterwards.,capstone,cix9zlz,6,t5_2slr8

2693368,0,t3_2quqoj,The faculty senate was very unhappy when classes were cancelled back in .  Spring  was even more extreme with some classes and all finals cancelled due to the tornado and many classes cancelled earlier that semester due to snow.I wonder if UA has priced out how much it would have to charge to charter a few aircraft to take students to Dallas as it would eliminate the need to cancel a whole week of classes.  UA Athletics already contracts with Delta to fly  s from Tuscaloosa and the MDB has previously chartered aircraft from Delta Allegiant Sun Country and Air Tran among others out of Birmingham.FWIW BHM can handle the  which would make for an interesting charter.,capstone,cna5532,2,t5_2slr8

4477695,0,t1_csv05iz,I felt like that at first but...Full disclosure..Im not in the demographic for gaming centers or have ever used one.I think rcapstone is a good place in the month or two leading up to the fall semester for a place like Hive to selfpromote.  Thousands of new freshmen the majority of which arent interested in FraternitySorority rushing will be descending upon Tuscaloosa.  Its not a bad idea to promote entertainment venues so they have an idea of whats going on.  Perhaps a better place for this would be in the wiki.  We have a guide to bars in Tuscaloosa but why not a guide for outdoor recreation digital entertainment and other things to do besides risking underage drinking charges?,capstone,csv2zhp,3,t5_2slr8

9768340,0,t3_5f2zje,I cant speak to your unique situation but I think theres a place for everyone at UA as with most large colleges. A majority of students are now from out of state which means you will find people from all backgrounds beliefs and ideals. Maybe Im too familiar with UA Alabama native and grew up coming to campus on Saturdays in the fall but I think Greek social influence is a bit overblown. I feel like any state school in the South is going to have some Greek social influence. Im not Greek and Ive never felt left out of anything. Football may be a different story. Football brings this university state and community together. Even if you dont like sports you might like football Saturdays just for the social aspect.,capstone,dah5xo9,4,t5_2slr8

11459378,0,t1_dfs396f,As a CS student at UA and I know a few at UAH Id argue the point of going UAH simply because of the different focus on C compared to UAs python and java. I will be graduating this semester and have found a ton of companies are searching for .Net experience or C experience if it comes to any computational work. Technically speaking once you know the fundamentals its easier to learn any language but I believe learning C would have been more beneficial than Java. Im from Huntsville and chose to come to UA for a different reason. But your son would get a better CS education from UAH. ,capstone,dfuwvhz,2,t5_2slr8
