533674,0,t1_cg0v3bo,I agree that it can be important to go through a time of wrestling with identity and purpose as long as its like you say  part of the Christian walk. Your responses throughout this thread seem very level and based in biblical thinking showing that this is part of the walk for you not something thats running you off the path altogether. One temptation for me at least is to look at my life and start asking if theres no fruit am I saved? Ive been reminded at various times that fruit it not just visiblecountable things like making converts its the fruit of the Spirit which are godly characteristics that take years to form so that when we need to exercise them they have become our first reaction. Whatever is happening right now even boredom or uselessness is hopefully preparing me to be better able to respond in the future. Proverbs   Whoever brings blessing will be enriched and one who waters will himself be watered. This verse has always encouraged me to do more even when I feel most alone or bitter. Im expecting to be watered but am I watering? When someone at church asks me to do somethingbring somethingparticipate I try to always say yes. It feels like small potatoes sure Ill bring a dessert but being faithful with small things leads to more responsibility and being faithful in bigger things. It takes time to though. I moved last year so Im still figuring out where I fit in my new citychurch. It sounds like youre still trying to figure out what to do about attending church so I just want to encourage you  dont stop trying. Dont stop going altogether. Since youre reformed Ill bring up the dialogical nature of worship its a dialogue between us and God. God calls us into his presence we respond in songprayer we hear from Gods Word we respond in songprayer. Simplified but you get the idea. This pattern is stronger in some reformed congregations than in others but its a great reminder that worship is partly about us  what we hear and learn from God  and partly about God  as we bring praise and prayer to him. And then there are those other people in the seats around us...we have to be able to live alongside them too. I guess what Im trying to say is that going to church is bigger than whether or not we get along or connect with people immediately God calls us to meet together to worship him every Lords Day. I hope you can find a place to do that where both the message and the people around you are able to waterfeed your soul.  ,brokehugs,cg0xotj,1,t5_2wx52

1314671,0,t1_cigkn50,Speaking only for myself the problem is not generallabourers comment but the support for it.People who demand gay Christians justify themselves every fucking time we do anything are bending over backwards to excuse neoNazi bullshit. And the fact they are supported by rAntiPOZI in that demonstrates that yes it is in fact neonazi bullshit no matter how they dishonestly try to pretend it isnt. You dont wind up in bed with people like that by accident.People are looking for excuses making up excuses to let folks like generallabourer off the hook while at the same time being extremely uncharitable towards gay Christians. Flat out refusing to listen to anything we say. Making up their own reasons for our actions and repeating them no matter how many times we explain our actual reasons. No matter that it is perfectly understandable to be upset at people talking about governments killing you en masse.The fact that people are now nitpicking and playing shitty semantic games to defend the idea of mass murder of gay people is horrifying and it isnt generallabourer doing that. Because clearly the Bible doesnt say over and over and fucking over again how we are to treat our neighbor. Nope if you want to pretend state sponsored execution of minority groups is somehow distinct from murder thats exactly how we are commanded to treat our neighbors. After all Nazi death camps were doing Gods work.I dont know if Im posting here again. I am definitely not posting in rChristianity again.You know the politician in my home state who has been sounding off on how gay people should be executed lost his primary election this week. Im sure people who dont face murderous hatred because of who they are on a daily basis will tell me I should just ignore people like that after all he didnt win. After all generallabourer is just one poster. But the support those people see is terrifying. A number of my neighbors voted for a man who wanted to see people like me rounded up and killed.

2085736,0,t1_cl4x9ne,Im in my s although I dont think thats relevant. I know people that are single and much older than I am that are in the same boat as me.Holiness is the character change that happens in a persons life. Sanctification is the part of our salvation process that sometimes we forget. It is the process where we become more and more like God in our character and our actions. Regarding our salvation Paul says For it is by grace you have been saved through faithand this is not from yourselves it is the gift of Godnot by works so that no one can boast. For we are Gods handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do Ephesians . We are saved from sin by the grace of God and we are saved to the good works that God has prepared for us. Holiness and sanctification are the second part of this doing the good works we are designed to do and becoming the sort of person who exemplifies qualities found for example in Matthew .Marriage doesnt necessarily contribute to our sanctification. People can make it work to that end but it is possible to be sanctified without marriage. We know this because marriage is a temporary covenant. It ends at death. In Matthew  Jesus says that at the resurrection when our sanctification is complete people will not be given in marriage. Ironically perhaps singleness looks to be the end result for everyone.,brokehugs,cl4xy9v,9,t5_2wx52

Our cultural heroes and icons are western cowboys and colonial revolutionaries our national mythology tells us that they were the few brave souls who stood up to tyranny and savagery and were only able to prevail because of their courage love of freedom and ability to kill a RedcoatIndian at a hundred yards.At their core every American gun nut thinks theyre a John Wayne hero who must stand ready to defend the womenfolk and children when modernday Indians or Redcoats attack and attack they will. The Indians are gang members drug dealers violent robbers illegal immigrants and terrorists or refugees fleeing civil war...same thing. The Redcoats are the Obummer Gestapo thugs who want to take away everyones freedom.  Except none of that is actually based on fact. Violent crime is at its lowest rate in twenty years. Obama has had almost eight years and he hasnt sent in ATF thugs to steal anyones actually legal firearms or ammo and neither did Clinton vicious persistent rumors about both to the contrary. Texas didnt get invaded during Jade Helm. Its all literally paranoid nonsense. And worst of all is the I gotta be ready to be a hero attitude. An untrained armed civilian in the midst of an active shooter situation faced with criminals or terrorists intent on causing death and destruction is more likely to cause more problems than save the day and sorry buddy hunting and the gun club do not constitute training.

Im not talking about people that identify as such but actual people in churches participating in liturgy. If anything the trend I have seen particularly with Orthodox congregations is a general distance from politics Im mostly acquainted with the Greeks and the Antiochians and the majority of the Catholics I have met and known have been cultural cafeteria Catholics that range from centreleft to centreright in North America in South Korea the Catholic Church has been a safe haven for political dissidents during the military dictatorships and leans pretty politically left in S. Korean context. Im well aware that both the Catholics and the Orthodox especially the Catholics vary a lot in shape and colour around the world but personally and anecdotally no I havent met these alt right weirdos outside of the internet. ,brokehugs,d2qrwen,9,t5_2wx52

This is not something Im that Im superinterested in but Im always looking at stuff and sometimes I see it.

Some dont. I didnt know in which category you were when I asked the question.In the case here I thought this might be against your rules so I told you. I was curious to see what youd do but I didnt actually suggest that you do anything.

9961387,0,t3_5i5r0k,So I had somehow never heard of presuppositional apologetics so I googled it. This is what Wikipedia has to saygtPresuppositionalism is a school of Christian apologetics that believes the Christian faith is the only basis for rational thought. It presupposes that the Bible is divine revelation and attempts to expose flaws in other worldviews. It claims that apart from presuppositions one could not make sense of any human experience and there can be no set of neutral assumptions from which to reason with a nonChristian. That is simply a delightful apologetic philosophy. This is how I imagine what the majority of presuppositional apologetics consists ofNonBeliever Why should I believe that the God of the Bible is real? Presup How dare you presume that God isnt real when your very existence depends on Him!NB ...What? Im not presuming that...P Instead of presuming that God isnt real you must presume that He is real and then it will be obvious to you that Hes real!NB But thats circular reasoning... P You cant use logic to argue against God because God created logic! NB backs away slowlyAnd the books description on Amazon is goldgtCliff has rescued the discipline from the elite circle of the intelligentsia and returned it as a biblical theology of truth communication to the common people i.e. to all believers. This volume will be of great help in the restoration of the practicality of biblical apologetics as it was exemplified in the early Church. Hopefully todays readers will be able to understand and put into practice the true nature of Peters command in  Peter  as it is strategically situated in its defi ning sic context.I fail to see how the strategy of combining apologetics with antiintellectualism could ever go wrong. ,brokehugs,db5ztew,11,t5_2wx52
