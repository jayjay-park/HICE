8453890,0,t3_4vf2hs,We need a bit more info to help you troubleshoot.   Will the key turn in the lock locking and unlocking the latch?  Can you open the door from inside? If you have movement from all handles but the door still wont open or the latch only partly releases you may have a worn latch assembly.   I havent touched a chevy door in a couple decades but as I remember there were  rods  from each handle that went to the latch assembly and a rod nearly straight up to the lock handle at the window. If the rods are binding or bent you may not get enough movement to fully release the latch.I found these with a quick search for Chevy C door latch diagram lots of photosadsThere are also several youtube videos but I ignore those due to my crappy internet connection.I dont remember if the Haynes manual has the door assembly diagram but it should.  I recommend that anyone working on their own vehicles to buy the Haynes or Chilton manual for that model lots of helpful diagrams and pictures.Best of luck and post a pic if you get the chance.  ,classictrucks,d5y9siy,2,t5_2sclp

Yeah the only place youll find the correct springs is the junk yard I doubt any retailer would have them.  And youll never ever have to worry about these trucks being a speed demon.  Mine has a  and a turbo  and its still slow as hell.,classictrucks,dg477o3,1,t5_2sclp
