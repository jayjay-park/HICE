However I could double and triple distribution missions how successful this is will depend on the corps agent locations much faster than with other mission types.  Doing so will trigger higher level storyline missions presuming you can keep them within the same corp that will produce much larger standings increases.  Also the higher level distribution missions pay out considerably more LPs than lower level security missions.  Also keep in mind that standings increases are a  of the difference between your currentstandings and . so a . reward isnt the same for someone with standings of  . of  and  . of .  ,evenewbies,cgsa91b,1,t5_2tkgx

Amarr and gallente ships are usually armor tanked while minmatar and caldari ships are generally shield tanked.

5437562,0,t3_3pgwy4,Exploration in low and high is pretty much a waste of time. Nullsec exploration can be very profitable and as long as you play smart you dont have to worry too much about getting killed. WH exploration is very hitormiss but when it hits it hits incredibly well. Some corpmates spent about an hour running combat sites in our WH and they ended up splitting the loot so everyone got about mil. I was exploring that whole time and came up with about mil in loot and didnt have to split it!.Get yourself a cloaking device ASAP they go try out nullsec. Once you can get into an Astero and have a CovOps cloak go try WH exploration stick to CC.Use your DScan. Spam the crap out of it. The last thing you want is to get killed because you didnt have situational awareness. Make yourself warpsafes. Dont bother with Data Sites theyll slow you down. A single can from a Relic site is often worth more than an entire Data site. Get a Cargo Scanner if your ship can fit it so you can check if a can is even worth hacking. If not just fail the hack so the site can despawn.Exploration is a lonely job but it has its moments. I relish in the rush of adrenaline I get when Im working through a site and suddenly I see a Svipul join the system with Combat Probes deployed. Then its a race against the clock to finish the hack and either cloak up or warp to safety. Its a lot of fun. This is the guide I got started with Ive since developed my own strategies but thisll get you in the right direction.If you want help ingame try hitting up one of the newbiefriendly corps like EUni or Signal Cartel.,evenewbies,cw6pat5,1,t5_2tkgx

8037961,0,t3_4pbgjk,Honestly if your budget is  plus go read up on builds for some games with actual demands and spec to that. The main thing for EVE at that price point is making sure you get video cards with enough of the right kinds of ports for however many monitors you want. If you want a  monitor setup dont buy a video card with only  ports and if you want to use HDMI make sure the card has those.EVE on max even multiple accounts just doesnt take that much. I built my last several computers I think its a fun project and not too hard just read the directions.The one thing I will mention is that if you get a or multiple monitors that are greater than  it taxes your video card basically proportionally more. When I upgraded to a X display I suddenly couldnt run games on max anymore until I upgraded my video card the number of extra pixels was taxing enough that my original card couldnt handle it. Manymost reviews are still done at X so a card that JUST manages to run max settings will fail on a higher res monitor or even if you just have multiples.Really though EVE is an old enough game that a pretty basic system runs  account on max settings with no problem. Im running an ik CPU GB of RAM with  Nvidia GTX s but Id probably go for a  if I was building it now. With a  a SSD for your OS a case and the other stuff you need like a power supply Im still not sure youll be gt which leaves you with some money to get monitors good mice and keyboards speakers etc. There is a good PC building subreddit but I cant for the life of me remember its name.,evenewbies,d4jjiyc,6,t5_2tkgx
8094414,0,t1_d4mrvlq,If you have a super shit resist like its  and the rest are  I usually plug it but generally more buffer is better.  The exception to this will of course be active ships where you probably want full resist rigs for shield and some mix of resistactive tank rigs for armor.For autocannons theyre widely regarded as not being in a great place right now basically due to the points you mentioned aka their damage is shit.  That being said they can still do pretty well but theyre much better when you can brawl in to get better projection of your damage to the target youre shooting.  The way damage formulas work you end up getting a lot of grazes and glancing shots as you noticed and your damage will be about  of what it says on paper at the edge of the first falloff.  For the tracking issues ACs actually have pretty great application so you should be ok make sure youre not outorbiting your own guns and dont use hail for maximum results.The new tracking score is the old tracking value assuming that youre shooting at a target with a radius of km iirc.  This makes it really good for comparison between ship classes since the sig res of your turrets no longer plays into the number but for flyinginspace purposes you either have to do the math to figure out what rads you can hit or do a little trial and error then remember it.If youre having issues with a particular ship feel free to ask and I can give some more specific advice.,evenewbies,d4pvved,1,t5_2tkgx

They close either x time after opening or when a total of y mass has passed through with x and y varying depending on the type of wormhole.   Also they only allow a ship with a max of z mass to pass through them again varying based on the wormhole for example Battleships other than the Nestor cant enter cs and capital ships cant enter c or under.When theres a hard limit to the viable mass of your fleet a Nestor starts looking a lot more tempting.  Say the core of my fleet is armour t cruisers with a few guardians and maybe a dread thrown in for yolo.  Sometimes well have to choose between bringing a FAX or another dread which is often when well bring in a few Nestors and Bhaalgorns before the dread.

There are good options among each race. Although currently the Gallente seem to be the strongest low skill ships with the Incursus Tristan and Fed Navy Comet in the frigate category. Caldari are probably second with the Merlin Kestrel and Hookbill. Minmatar is a bit under powered these days with the Rifter Breacher and Firetail but with plans to reduce PG cost on small arty there will likely be a bit of a resurgence and some new interesting fits I hope anyway. As you progress into destroyers and cruisers things tend to get a bit more even. The Minmatar Talwar is an awesome small gang dessy the Aglos is amazing in groups or solo. The Cormorant can be a deadly sniper platform when youve got the s to alpha things and the Dragoon is just scary with a neut bonus.Similarly into cruisers youve got great options across the board so I really wouldnt worry too much but I would try to make sure youre planning to fly similarly tanked ships all armor tank all shield tank etc. That way if you decide to fly with a dedicated logi pilot theyll actually be able to rep everyone.As for whether or not it makes sense to fly with support in smallmicro gang it absolutely does.

If you reactivate  Omega later  you will regain the ability to use omega only ships modules and skills you had previously trained up. gtWould it get deleted from my character inventory? Would it be there but with a you cant use this warning?No you can have ships and modules you cant use. You can even have them fitted to your ship. For example if you have tech  modules on a tech  frigate. The tech  frigate of your race you will be able to fly. However the tech  modules will be offlined and you will not benefit from them and thus would need to replace them with something you can use.  For ships you would not be able to get into any ship that you cannot fly. However you could for example haul trade sell and buy them. You should get an offline warning. However you should double check all your ships before undocking them if you go from a omega to alpha state. I should note that plexing your account is something that is beyond most  new players. Being able to generate that kind of income requires experience and skills that new players just do not possess. It is possible to do however their are very ways to do it as a new player without sinking a considerable amount of time into the game each month. Your best bet is to play as an alpha until you are maxed out on skills and focus on learning the game and making money. I recommend having enough for at least  plexes and enough to replace your main money making ship a couple of times if in high sec or a few times if anywhere  else.  You will also want plan on which ship you want to get into to make isk  once you get omega state as well as the fittings you will need and then develop a training plan for it so you can maximize your training time and focus on getting in that money making ship. To make the kind of isk you need to make to plex an account with fairly low skills i would recommend exploration and running combat sites. When you learn how to do these and where to run them you can plex an account very quickly with the loot. I would stay away from missions and mining. These have very steady isk an hour but its quite low and it will be much like working the line in a factory. Your best bet is dealing in loot from relic and data sites and trying to get faction and deadspace items higher end items from combat sites. I recommend caldari for your starting race. As their ships are easier to make money in with low skills.  You can also once omega train into the worm frigate gila cruiser and rattlesnake  battleship by training up gallente ships. They are some of the best ships in the game to make isk in.,evenewbies,d9yro4c,3,t5_2tkgx

Gallente have alot of specialized haulers each designed to excel at carrying a certain type of cargo. Minmatar are faster while still have a nice cargo size and tank. Caldari have a nice balance if you dont intend to train higher. I recommend gallente or minmatar or just just picking the one whose ships you like the look since you plan to stay a alpha a bit.Getting into finding stuff to haul will be a bit harder as youll need to find items to move.

10263762,0,t3_5l6ozt,This is a pretty large task that may take a considerable amount of time. The good news is the limiting factor for an Astero is the hull BPC which can be found if you run enough of the right types of drone sites or Sisters LP stores.  If you want to go the sisters route I might start with their Epic Arc to get a quick large boost to their faction standings if youve run it before youll likely also pull a sisters storyline mission for a further boost.  The easiest fittings will be meta fittings which can be found from the various faction NPC wrecks missions combat sites even belt rats.  You can get these while grinding the Sisters LP to get AsteroSisters LP store modulesammo.  Rigs can be made from salvage t rigs will require t or faction rat wrecks or relic sites.  If youre already mission running save the mm and thicker armor plates and many of the large guns and medium and large EMPs because these produce a healthy amount of minerals and will save you some time mining.  Tech  fittings and drones will require a considerable investment in skills science skills and moon goo which will be harder to acquire and refine youll need a tower on a variety of moons in lownull sec or you can try to find tower owners who arent paying attention to siphon from but I believe youll still need a tower to refine the higher level products.  For PI products I prefer extracting and processing to P then processing from P on a factory planet which reduces POCO taxes and hauling volumes.  If your planets are close together you can certainly extract Rs and process them up to your final outputs.  If your planets are rich enough you can probably process them all the way to P.  Then you can manufacture higher level products on factory planets aside from your drones most products dont require too much PI materials so this shouldnt be too hard.  Unless you also mean you want to build an ECCitadel to do the construction.  That requires quite a bit of PI but you can probably extract all of it pretty quickly with  accounts  PI toons. ,evenewbies,dc7gbvd,1,t5_2tkgx

11245737,0,t1_df6kzyz,If you continue to mine or rat while neuts are in local you are asking to be ganked. My current alliance has cloaky alts that are sitting in systems for weeks at a time cloaked up just so people like you get used to going about business with them there. Then suddenly they will either gank themselves or provide a cloaky warp in for a gank.I have lost a over ship exactly one time in years of doing it and was not realizing I was going to low sec when I took a mission in high sec.
