I have a sweet idea for a cool use of motion tracked vr but not much motivation compared to other dev stuff as not many people have these devices yet and even less have a heads up display. Its fun though and its clear that vr wont really take off until this is in all the flagship phones which I for see happening faster then most people expect.

Starts with Tango a D sensing technology kind of Kinect for mobile nothing really new but ends with the statement that Cardboard is very relevant for Tango and that they will talk more about this on .The Cardboard section makes the valid point that Cardboard VR isnt really the same as high end HMD based VR as it is more like looking into a world than being in a world partly due to having to hold it in front of your face. They call it bitesized VR and point out that it even has some advantages e.g. quality is so low that experiences stay well below the uncanny valleyInstead of going for full VR experiences they recommend partial VR where somemost of the app works in D and only parts are VR. As an example they name Kerbal Space Program where you could build a rocket conventionally and then watch the launch in VR.,GoogleCardboard,cp3c06m,3,t5_32byj

3443935,0,t1_cpktnwa,Im pretty sure they plan to win they just use another strategy than ValveHTC or FacebookOculus. These approach from kind of the high end with rather high costs for consumers which limits how many people they will reach. Google is coming from the low end and already has the largest VR platform by far. The K distributed Cardboards mentioned in the interview are probably too low as the Cardboard app passed the M download mark almost two months ago.Google has a developer HMD kit for AR with project Tango and they seem to be working on combining it with VR. But the overall VR strategy is closer to Android they didnt built the phones themselves instead they provided the OS for others and made money from services. Something similar will happen with the not officially announced Android VR OS basically theyll enable hardware makers to produce VR headsets and VR optimized phones. And it is a very safe bet that future generations of smartphones will provide a much better VR experience if Android VR comes with optimizations similar to those Oculus made to Android on the Note  for Gear VR. As the same strategy worked quite well for grabbing a large part of the smartphone market Id say this is a large push just not in the direction those focusing on consumer HMDs would expect. Its more the platform approach Oculus is talking about.,GoogleCardboard,cpku1ar,3,t5_32byj

3536987,0,t1_cpvfai4,For this it should work just fine. A problem will be that you cannot adjust the FoV in software so if you use an app that renders an  FoV for Cardboard on lenses that provide a  FoV the edges of the image will move at the wrong speed during head turns. But this is a minor detail esp. if you dont feel sick in Cardboard.I compared the unmodified Ritech will post pictures of the modification Cardboard and a Xiaozhai with stacked lenses and while both Cardboard and modified Xiaozhai provided enough immersion to trigger my fear of heights the higher than Cardboard FoV of the altered HMD provides a significantly improved VR experience even though geometric distortions make it look weird during head turns. Everything also becomes more grainy but with the p resolution of the G it should look great. So once youve got your Homido it would be really interesting to see your direct comparison between Ritech Cardboard and Homido esp. how different the VR experience feels due to their respective very low medium and high FoV. ,GoogleCardboard,cpvftgh,2,t5_32byj

3608510,0,t1_cq3auxs,gt and right now we are seeing the advent of k QuadHD and even k phones will be making their appearance soon.I challenge you on this. The current dpi on cell phone screens is already beyond the need of human eyes even when you use your phone  cm away from your face. The recent use of K screen on some cell phones is already controversial as such higher resolution drains the battery but bring little merit to the daily experience. It makes no sense for companies to put a K screen on a cell phone even if technology allows it. What make it worse is the Fresnel lens. Although it gives you a very small FL within a limited thickness usually its concentric circles causes artifacts that largely increase the pixelization effect making a K screen feel like a p screen. Perhaps the Fresnel lenses used here are specially engineered. But before any close up pictures is taken through them I wont buy a VR set with Fresnel lenses.,GoogleCardboard,cq3lh7t,0,t5_32byj

Also Cardboard isnt really intended as an HMD which is partly a strength. E.g. it is very easy to pass Cardboard around in a group giving everybody a quick wow so it is more social than e.g. the Oculus Rift and it would be nice to reflect these differences. I also think that Cardboard would be the perfect device for a specific type of local multiplayer games to be played by drunk people at parties but maybe the header shouldnt reflect this.,GoogleCardboard,crtrjrj,0,t5_32byj

Granted it has no cameraout ability which yours has in abundance.So does yours include straps to up its value? Is it durable enough that itll last longer? Will it provide THAT much of a better fit vs. the foam pads on my cheap China set which feels very comfortable btw? What about compatibility with whatever device I have both now and in the future?

The longandshort of it is you cant fix it. Most Cardboard apps are made in Unity using the Durovis Dive VR SDK.Unfortunately this SDK drifts pretty badly around the y axis and the autocalibration feature doesnt always work and was only added in version  so apps built using version  have no calibration at all.Hopefully a new SDK will be released soon perhaps by Oculus that solves the sensor drift issue. Until then all we can do is grit our teeth and deal with it. Source,GoogleCardboard,ctjm0d1,7,t5_32byj

4790977,0,t1_ctyfazi,Kind of. Ive never had a higher end Mobile VR headset. BUT I have tried the two extremes of VR. I own a V Google Cardboard and was able to entertain myself with it for a couple of weeks before it got old and started collecting dust. Definitely worth the experience for the  it was though. Then I tried the HTC Vive which is coming out in November and will be ballpark . This thing is a on a whole different playing field dont know why all the baseball analogies. Any phonebased VR is... just not a whole lot different than holding your phone close up to your face with some D glasses. The more expensive freefly will be more comfortable and give you a bigger field of view but it wont be immersive like a highend VR HMD. I cant really explain the difference to you if you havent already tried an Oculus or Vive but it is ridiculous. Its also pretty important to note for me at least that Mobile VR is SO limited in the way of content. Theres just only so much you can do on a phones processinggraphics power. I think a  Cardboard is worth the money. I think an expensive consumer HMD Vive or Oculus is worth the money. But I really dont think an expensive Mobile HMD like Firefly Homido or Gear VR is worth it when these topoftheline VR HMDs are just around the corner. Mobile VR is pretty cool and has a fleeting interest. Real VR is AMAZING.,GoogleCardboard,ctyfwue,5,t5_32byj

If the display contents are updated midrefresh tearing will be visible so its important to update the contents only between cycles. The system receives a signal from the display when its safe to update the contents. For historical reasons well call this the VSYNC signal.So if it cant do over  video players wont be coded to push harder.

7247019,0,t1_d217ugr,Although it isnt for Cardboard and requires an NVidia card Ive found Streamtheater to work infinitely better on the GearVR than Trinus. The image quality so so much higher that it is incomparable the streaming is fasterFPS is higher the headlook latency lower and doesnt require you to dick around with as many settings.Usually Im not a fan of using such a closed product as NVidias streaming protocol but the results are simply night and day.,GoogleCardboard,d21xnkm,3,t5_32byj
7269097,0,t1_d24d6j1,Much thought optics later... you need the phone to be pushed behind the focal point of the lenses of the viewer. As long as your eye isnt further from the lens then the focal distance the view wont be flipped. So you need either a viewer for which you can move the phone much further away or a viewer with a much stronger lens swap. Convex lenses are a no go I had a wrong idea about something. Each viewer uses some lens that has some focal length. Taking the cardboard v standard lenses are . diopters. If your glasses are  that means that you need roughly . diopter lenses for the same distance. . d   mm. d  mm which would place the v phone position as mm behind the focal length. I dont think its exactly accurate but you need a viewer which can move the lens further from the phone by . cm. The homido moves it about cm in both directions so that isnt enough. I dont think any viewer can move that far. However while Im not a fan the homido has these rubber cones that hold the lenses. It is very easy to swap the lenses for other ones. So what youd want to do is use the homido with the smaller cone and replace the lens used with one with approx FL  m. best view for smaller phone. If your phone is bigger you can get away with the middle cone and FL mm. The biggest cone would be most compatible for  you without glasses  but you end up being very far from the phone and im pretty sure youd see the inside of the walls. The lenses used by the homido are the same diameter as the V lenses. So long story short if you want the best viewer for you to use without glasses without lots of reengineering youll want to get the homido and then find a source of high quality lenses to replace the ones there. LENS SOURCE example Lenses are much cheaper than the viewer so  youd be able to trial and error through the options. ,GoogleCardboard,d24g2z9,1,t5_32byj

7380452,0,t3_4gdm3z,Heres a video demonstrating the depth camera they used showing the pixel cloud data delivered via USB that is used for sensing the room and objects in it. This camera seems to be working somewhat different than the Leap Motion which generates the pixel cloud data in software on a PC which is computationally expensive. The consequence is that the Leap Motion Android SDK never made it out of the closed alpha program most likely because it is too computationally demanding for phones.According to the video the ObamaMerkel tested PMD pico flexx camera board will work with a Samsung Galaxy S not a high end phone by todays standard so it probably does a lot of the computation by itself. Lenovo announced a USD  Google Tango phone with Timeofflightdepth camera for Summer  and as PMD is a hardware partner for Google Tango it will probably feature this one. So we will get positional tracking room sized VR and the option to use our hands in VR in Cardboard rather soon.Dont expect to buy it as an addon to your existing phone though the pico flexx is currently sold only as an evaluation device for software and hardware developers for EUR USD  while the Leap Motion sells for less than EUR USD  on Aliexpress And yes the Aliexpress versions work I have one and Leap Motion confirmed that these are not illegal copies but versions sold through partners most likely getting rid of inventory.,GoogleCardboard,d2h3ux2,3,t5_32byj

7493203,0,t3_4hxwvk,Looks pretty cool nice job!  A couple quick comments.  The magnetic button wouldnt work on my cardboard viewer.  Tapping the screen allowed me to move but not using my button.  Not sure if thats something specific with my viewer or more general.If there has to be a popup ad it should come up before showing anything else and before going into VR mode.  Then I wouldnt put it in my viewer and then have to take it out to close the ad.When I walk into a wall and move along it I can kind of see through it in flashes.  If you can make the threshold where you run into the wall a bit farther away from the wall then the camera wouldnt partially pass into the wall.  Effectively you can make an invisible wall a bit offset from the visible wall to prevent the camera from moving into the real wall. ,GoogleCardboard,d2txqcx,1,t5_32byj

Because of zbuffer quirks with the ps architecture Im not sure if any d would result...OP doesnt mention but there is a patched gsdx plugin with stereo optionsSomeones even been working to hack it to work with Nvidias d Vision if thats your thingSample from that thread  ,GoogleCardboard,dcwyyuu,2,t5_32byj
10695762,0,t3_5szm16,I stopped posting the weekly Apps released this week series and website sorry about that but hopefully the link in the OP provides an alternative source for new Cardboard apps. Im not affiliated with that site but thats where I compiled my lists from.I still believe it is important to provide a consistent and transparent source of traffic to new CardboardDaydream apps to encourage taking risks and avoid copying the trend. Hopefully having this link as a sticky helps that direction of consistent traffic. But theres still a long way to go.Cheerscmdr,GoogleCardboard,ddj6sdb,1,t5_32byj

11494944,0,t1_dfywr09,Tracking only works with proprietary Chinese app which isnt that great although you can load your content into the player the sight control interface isnt the best and only supports up to HD. I dispense with all that and like it just as a cardboard viewer because it has the clearest image out of all my headsets and what I believe to be a genuine  FOV.,GoogleCardboard,dfyy8y4,1,t5_32byj

11625873,0,t1_dgdp7l6,Just to get a large screen when playing various emulators watching twitch and so on while away from home. Have everything work from the get go with twice the resolution instead of having to rely on every app being made for cardboard. I dont watch anything D so theres no advantage to cut resolution in half cut performance in half and having to rely on cardboard apps for me. As well as being able to switch between various apps and so on without removing the phone from the vr headset as you cant see anything when the phone is in normal mode with a D vr headset.Im not sure if Wearality sky for example is able to view the entire screen.,GoogleCardboard,dgdszaj,1,t5_32byj
