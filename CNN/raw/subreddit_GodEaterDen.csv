Lindow Amamiya Determination .Personal abilities Reminiscence Venom Resistance  Leak Resistance  Stun Resistance . Unlocked by default. Veteran B Melee Healing  Stamina Regen . Unlocked automatically after completing Lindows Character Episode .Lindow now a member of the travelling unit Cradle remains mostly unchanged also. Same great defensive skills same gun form that just gets in the way. Lindows Blood Arts is Drive Twister which improves the damage of the first Triangle attack in a combo. Needs Oracle management for reasons I have explained enough times now. Veteran isnt bad to have if youre stuck for choice and it synergises well with Full Force to add a bit more oomph to his attacks.Soma Schicksal  st Generation God Arc Buster Blade  Tower||Name|Trigger|Other info|||Blood Arts|CC Boosted|Charge Crash|Link Support|Improved Unbinding |Time |Duration  minutes.Innate abilities God Eater Stamina  Wide Guard  Item Speed .

Silent Champion Burst Time  Devour Healing  Healing Pod . Unlocked automatically after completing Somas Character Episode .Soma also in Cradle has really mellowed out over the years. Hes gotten over his rebellious teen phase and now follows in his parents footsteps performing research on new Aragami species. Somas Blood Arts is CC Boosted a Charge Crash attack with an optional second stage of charge that the AI sadly doesnt utilise well. His defensive capabilities have lost a slight edge Damage Reduction is only  levels rather than  and he no longer has Draw Aggro. He gained Healing Pods in return which I suppose reflects his development as a team player. Theres also some awkward tension between Soma and Erina due to the fact that he fought alongside her brother Eric and witnessed his death. He handles this rather sensitive topic with remarkable delicateness showing how much hes matured between the timelines.Alisa Illinichina Amiella  nd Generation God Arc Long Blade  Assault  Buckler||Name|Trigger|Other info|||Blood Arts|Sonic Caliber|SQ|Link Support|Full Burst|Time |Innate abilities God Eater Stamina  Wide Guard  Item Speed  Pass Level .

Requires listed skills costs  GAP and  AP. Followup Rescue Burst  Healing Reserve  Healing Ammo . Unlocked automatically after completing Alisas Character Episode .Our favourite Russian underboob now loses the stockings and also bares her delicious thighs as well... prpr. Um where was I? Oh right  Alisas Blood Arts is Sonic Caliber which adds damage and reach to her Square attacks. She trades in some of her battery skills and gains field medic skills diversifying her support capability but diminishing her overall utility. Now she doesnt hold an edge against some of the other battery characters cough Gilbert cough and field medic doesnt matter all that much if you dont actually fall. Still moving the Healing Proficiency out from her innate skills does free up the niche viability of a rangedheavy build if you care enough to bother. In the story shes doing quite a lot of humanitarian work helping out in the ghetto districts and is popular with the folk that live out there.Tatsumi Ohmori  st Generation God Arc Short Blade  Buckler||Name|Trigger|Other info|||Blood Arts|Fatal Riser|Rising Edge|Link Support|Delay Aragami sec|Time |Duration  minutes.Innate abilities God Eater Stamina  Wide Guard  Item Speed .

Unlocked automatically after completing Tatsumis Character Episode .Tatsumis Blood Arts is Fatal Riser an improved Rising Edge. His status as a vanilla melee character remains mostly unchanged likewise with his infatuation of the operator Hibari. In Rage Burst the original Tatsumi is overshadowed by the superior performance of the Alternate version. Sad but true.Brendan Bardell  st Generation God Arc Buster Blade  Tower||Name|Trigger|Other info|||Blood Arts|CC Breaker|Charge Crash|Link Support|Stamina Saver |Time |Duration  minutes.Innate abilities God Eater Stamina  Wide Guard  Item Speed .

Fully Prepared Item Effect  Healing Pod  Hold Trap . Unlocked automatically after completing Shuns Character Episode .That looks basically like the same skillset he had in Resurrection. Oh hes lost Quiet? Whatever. Shuns Blood Arts is Flywheel an Aerial Triangle attack that can be used in rapid succession up to  times while keeping him airborne. Fully Prepared contrary to its name only prepares him with one Hold Trap  whats up with that? It might be worth it taking Shun soulsearching out to the swamps of Lerna and pick up a Short Blade or Variant Scythe from there.Karel Schneider  st Generation God Arc Assault||Name|Trigger|Other info|||Link Support|Substitute|Time |Duration  minutes or until first instance of damage blocked.Innate abilities God Eater Oracle  Stamina  Item Speed  Oracle Cartridge .
