1762772,0,t1_cjvj9l0,i find that for the notes that are at the very top of my range that i need to be able to hear them in my head before i start to play them so it is much easier to get the top notes if they form part of a scale of arpeggio. So i would suggest practising your scales in general but particularly with the major scale of the note you want as the tonic so that you can hear it plus the highest note you can currently play is the th. It takes a lot of practice but the silly notes are the most fun to play but not the most useful.,brass,ck1cr60,1,t5_2qwje

Also this device will really help you get used to using everything that is in your lungs.Happy breathing!,brass,clld6q6,2,t5_2qwje
4470630,0,t1_cstjn29,Whatever the instrument switch dont worry about transposition and pitch as an issue just accept it and deal with the differences. I switch between E flat treble clef and concert pitch bass clef on the tuba and it just takes me a minute to make a mental adjustment to think natively as either.Ive got a suspicion that coming from a reed instrument will make the smaller brass instruments more approachable. Not because of embouchure but the use of breath of long sustained phrasing against a lot of resistance as opposed to very freeflowing breath through a larger bore. Singers on the other hand are very wellpositioned to tackle large brass instruments.,brass,csu73n0,2,t5_2qwje

Of course your own physiology will change how you should articulate slightly. Your tounge should not strike  your tounge is simply a valve moving in and out of the airstream. Arbans is really your best friend! Those tounging sections are a godsend!,brass,deutq32,2,t5_2qwje
