2270022,0,t3_2l7s52,IWD is really skimpy on the gear  by the end of IWD I just barely had enough stuff to equip all the chars in my party... all three.weapons are okay few great ones  APR stuff fire flail Three White Doves and a lot of crap armor isnt in a huge supply and the rest... lets just say there are  amulets in the game that are actually useful and about  boots one of which I had to edit to remove the annoying extra speed.heres a reference guide for all items ingameby the way... dont use the armor spell. buy Robe of Enfusing from Orrick and combine it with shield the spell not an actual one.,icewinddale,clsam08,4,t5_2wczg

5613270,0,t3_3rzhql,This is a hard fight but you can do it. It took me like ten tries when I beat it for the first time when the original came out. Try different strategies youll feel much more satisfied if you barely squeeze out a win than if you cheat your way out of it. Also I think the EE scales him to your level if you do the expansion first but I could be wrong about that. It really is a difficult fight. ,icewinddale,cwsvpgi,2,t5_2wczg
