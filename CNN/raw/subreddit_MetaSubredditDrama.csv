3238116,0,t3_2x76yg,A year ago there seemed to be a much more middle of the road atmosphere in SRD than there is now. Personally I am an extremely left wing young person that should agree with how left leaning SRD comment sections are now but I just find them very eyerolly now instead. I mostly only read the drama linked now instead of any comments on the thread vastly turning down my enjoyment of the sub.This is not because I disagree with the content and thus dont want to see it  but because there are no differing viewpoints that will also be represented to read unless you dig down into the comment graveyard in any thread and becomes SRDD fodder.It used to be fun. Now I can pick out a thread title and guess at the top four comments and they could have been straight out of circle broke. There is a thread every day where the top comment is literally just but what about the menz with no hint of irony. The next comments devolve into shitty low effort jerking about cabals jews lizard people and jet fuel. ,MetaSubredditDrama,coxmyqv,40,t5_2ugn3

3257892,0,t1_cozotjt,gt Im not a troll Im just a white guy trying to understand the problems minorities face. Im just asking the question  why are those uppity minorities and females so angry when I call them names?gt I know this is anecdotal but Ive got a Japanese friend who I jokingly call Jap all the time and he thinks its funny.Well Im sure your connections to Japan are deep I have a black friend! but it is actually offensive. Maybe your friend doesnt think its offensive maybe if shes Japanese they dont say anything and maybe any one of a hundred other things but your anecdote doesnt mean anything.gt Theses statements appear contradictory. Who has the power to decide whats offensive? Is it the person receiving the offense? Then a word being used to dehumanize people doesnt matter those people can just choose not to be offended.People can choose to be not offended when white men use slurs against them? Are you so lacking in empathy for people other than yourself that you dont think other peoples offense matters?gt In trademark law a mark is considered obscene when a significant portion of the referenced group finds it offensive and files suit.I and my IP law professor appreciate you teaching me the law. Where did you go to law school and in what jurisdictions are you licensed to practice?Thanks for the downvote as well.  Its obvious youre a troll because no one could be as obtuse as youre pretending to be.In short as an attorney who doesnt focus on IP but does trademark work and who lived in Japan and speaks Japanese I appreciate your lessons on Japan and the law. Its obvious that to you Im a Paki or a Chink and not an attorney or Japanese speaker  unlike a white man Im not fully human.,MetaSubredditDrama,cozowv6,3,t5_2ugn3

Why?I suppose so though Id say that beyond the defaults which have a similar culture the individual subreddits form their own distinct cultures.gt How often do you visit Reddit? How often do you visit rsubredditdrama?I usually visit reddit a few times a day and SRD slightly less that than once or twice a day to one every couple of days depending on how busy I am. I also sometimes take breaks from reddit for a week or two now and then.gt Do you feel you participate in rsubredditdrama often  or at all? Would you consider yourself a prominent member more of a lurker or somewhere inbetween?Somewhere in between probably. I post comments often but I dont regularly post drama or anything.gt What do you feel you gain from this subreddit? Is it just for entertainment purposes?Mostly entertainment. I also like the variety of discussions you can have here because it takes drama from all around reddit its like a microcosm of the site. gt How do you feel rsubredditdrama differs from other subreddits you visit?The fact that the community participating in the comments can change from post to post depending on the topic. Some of the people who are interested in race wars or gender wars may never comment on steak or semantics drama which means that the feel of the comments section can change from thread to thread. gt Would you say you feel connected to any other users of this subreddit? Have you formed any friendships rivalries or even just a level of familiarity with other Redditors?I like the posts of some of the users here but Ive never really interacted with them enough to get close. I have on other subs though as its easier to form friendships and rivalries in smaller more focused communities.gt Do you feel you represent yourself accurately when communicating on Reddit  for example do you say or do things on here which you would be more hesitant to do in real life facetoface scenarios? Do you notice this behaviour in other users of this subreddit?Im more argumentative here than in real life. Conflict upsets me when its happening in my day to day life but in an anonymous controlled environment I find it fun. Im pretty much equally open about things like political beliefs online and in person though. I dont know if other people are more or less open here or in real life though people seem more combative here than people I know in real life are but that could be a cultural difference as Im not an  American and most people here are.
