5026718,0,t1_curq78w,The usual build path atm tends to be. Cinderhulk gt Ninja Tabi or Merc gt Spirit Visage gt Deadmans gt Randuins gt Warmogs or Thornmail depending on the team.You can get CDR boots instead if you prefer running less CDR in your rune page. Deadmans plate really is not that great on Zac compared to other champions but you need armor and hp and Thornmail sucks now. So you just end up getting it since there is no better item. Randuins is great but it sucks early game now so I end up getting Deadmans first since it helps moving around the map as well.,thesecretweapon,curwsoo,4,t5_38tb6
6882184,0,t1_d0ut5cf,Correct me if Im wrong doesnt Zac heal based on his max hp while the cost of his abilities are based on his current?  I didnt think his missing hp played a role in his actual healing just in his ability costs.,thesecretweapon,d0wetdy,1,t5_38tb6
7171547,0,t3_4d6o26,I run  scaling CDR flat armor yellows and attack speed redattack speed and armor for the early clear and CDR for the midlate game.It seems like it works well to me but Im Silver  so what do i know ,thesecretweapon,d1tc5mm,1,t5_38tb6
7192796,0,t1_d1vj74q,I started the season in Bronze so Ive found it so easy to carry late game as Zac even when I fell behind early on. I imagine as you rise in elo it will prove more challenging to come back and carry. It seems so easy at silverbronze elo to shove a side wave and either take a side turret or win a v mid lane. ,thesecretweapon,d1vrf39,1,t5_38tb6

8725136,0,t1_d6w73zu,Actually I just looked and the video you linked is on ..  Current patch is ..  Sorry looks like you need to play another game of Zac if you want to get a coaching game.  When you do just link it here again.,thesecretweapon,d6wa8ds,2,t5_38tb6
8754945,0,t3_4zyohx,Zac of course isnt really a notably snowbally champion but if youre ahead then  damage items is a good idea. Especially in a situation where youre picking up more kills than anyone else on your team its a good idea to invest some of that gold in to damage or your lead might not be so significant. Liandrys is pretty much always the best single damage option but abyssal scepter and even protobelt can be good. The downside to this bruiser build is that if the enemy is ahead you wont be able to survive engages on multiples enemies and you really want to live as long as possible duh to maximize your damage with W and cinder. In games where you need to make a couple of high priority picks having a couple damage items makes it possible to deal huge chunks of carries health and maybe even one shot them. You might want to pick up a GA with this kind of build to help survive engages after performing your combo and repeat,thesecretweapon,d700y1e,1,t5_38tb6
8847865,0,t1_d7baawy,Do you see the cone shape appear when you cast and hold? Your mouse should be within the area of the cone. You shouldnt be overshooting unless you just miss the skill shot on its own. Im actually using pretty generalised runes with a  cdr. But the ideal runes are getting magic pen quints or marks. And general tackiness from armor and magic resist. Its up to you to decide if youd like to use cdr quints instead. If youre gonna play damage its best to get magic pen for both quints and marks. You can get items like liandry or Rylai ,thesecretweapon,d7bdyr9,1,t5_38tb6
8970201,0,t3_534ytw,They arent terrible. My only issue is the CDR as it is a bit wonky. The flat cdr is helpful early and all but leaves you with a really weird cdr number. cdr. Usually you want to run scaling to  or flats to  and then cap on items without wasting cdr or being a few under. The scaling health and magic pen is good though. The cdr is the right idea but a bit wonky,thesecretweapon,d7q2yqp,2,t5_38tb6

9051600,0,t3_52rvgd,? Skuttle is like a free health pot? E onto it dropping its MR then spam QW collecting blobs to lower W cd and regen health? its pretty simple and no slower than other champs.,thesecretweapon,d7zuwjx,1,t5_38tb6
9077617,0,t3_54k6ah,In my experience farm and deaths have been the difference between getting an S and not. I have played a lot of top recently and seen a lot more S games because of farm. ,thesecretweapon,d82zdht,1,t5_38tb6
9176563,0,t1_d8f5u0v,I have seen more bans recently but in higher elo hes easy to abuse and I find if you hover hil b banphase less people ban him,thesecretweapon,d8f736h,1,t5_38tb6
9354797,0,t3_5881py,I played  Zac games this morning at around Plat MMR and the biggest difference I have noticed is that people dont ban Zac anymore. I still feel like Zac is strong. All the things that made Zac good are very much intact. I think his early ganks midlane were affected most. Those have become much harder to hit. Sometimes I use a flash  E for an instant engage just because people dont expect it. But if you slingshot in at the same time champions are engaged in an ability animation you can still hit a high percent of them. Except on Riven...ban Riven.So while I do notice a difference and am adapting to it I think Zac is still strong if he focuses on being secondary engage or counterengage and peel instead of primary teamfight engage.,thesecretweapon,d91sd2j,1,t5_38tb6
9416005,0,t1_d98ncbl,Yea thats how i do it. Stop at talisman get Lucidity and Kindlegem and then finish cinderhulk. Maybe if they are stacked on MR you can also get Spirit Visage before that.,thesecretweapon,d99jllk,1,t5_38tb6
9639965,0,t1_da19iko, Nope this doesnt work the special bonus experience is unique so if you already have Hunters Talisman buying Hunters Machete wont give you any bonus xp. So with the clear u mentioned youll get about half to level . Just tried it out to be save. D The backtracking is kinda annoying but since you have to start Raptors for max xp i dont see another way to do it.. ,thesecretweapon,da1bofp,2,t5_38tb6
