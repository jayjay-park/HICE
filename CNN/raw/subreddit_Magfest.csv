52689,0,t3_1uorvy,I liked the way the board games were done this year. It was nice to have them sort of separated from the rest of the event and there was much more space than last year. It was still packed to the brim most of the time but it was a more comfortable space at least. ,Magfest,cekfg47,2,t5_2tbqi

6606242,0,t1_d02mmin,It isnt an excuse. Put that many people in a place shit will happen. We all know it isnt acceptable and chances are no one here is the . of Katsucon attendees who did it. Youre speaking down to people who agree with you. No one thinks this is acceptable but talking about it for the next week wont fucking benefit anyone except the con because it will give them license to treat us like we should know why prices are increased. This shit isnt enough to raise prices unless delusional pedants dont stop bringing it up.I assume you are a con goer or you wouldnt be here. I think youre taking a moral grandstand on something no one here thinks is acceptable.,Magfest,d02n2ow,2,t5_2tbqi

6668909,0,t1_d08yq8t,gt Another wholly subjective complaint Nothing in the merch room really popped. The vendors are beginning to feel recycled. What I mean is most everything I saw this year I saw last year and the year before that.I dont know if MAGFest can do anything about this but I also felt this way this year. Ive bought that apparel I have enough of those art prints and I dont need the overpriced board games and retro games. I had  in Mpoints and I couldnt find a way to spend them besides the merch booth.,Magfest,d094fav,2,t5_2tbqi
6672481,0,t1_d08q2cm,Jay and Chris of Autographs were heroes to us and helped us do everything we needed and more. So in terms of the actual Autograph staff you guys get an  out of . Our group was super excited to have its first session. But the security outside the doors were rude condescending and honestly kind of hostile.Its no secret almost no ine came down to get in line for us post show and Im not upset about that but Im trying to get data on why. Part of my assumption is signage the other is there were two other autographs set up at the same time. Dunno if that had anything to do with anyone being turned away but from what i heard about the  person capacity cap on other autographs Im only wondering if that was a factor.I know autographs and celebrities isnt what magfest is about but honestly something either needs to be fixed and learned from Cons where autographs are done professionally or you just need into drop it as a feature entirely. When it comes to those kind of fans you cant disservice them with a broken system.,Magfest,d09hq91,2,t5_2tbqi

6678056,0,t1_d09z5o8,Hey thanks for the props! I was with GTX and Cyril all throughout the evening concerts I was the chatty main MAGFest moderator all weekend and we all had an amazing time with the chat.As far as the power issue GTXCrusader said it best. We all had heart attacks and I was literally running around trying to figure out where the source of the outage was. I was absolutely livid but fortunately we only lost about  minutes of footage versus  hours of footage.,Magfest,d0a2ib6,1,t5_2tbqi

6757012,0,t3_46spbu,First off Thank you everyone who volunteered their time and effort to run Magfest this year!  I heard about departments being understaffed but overall I believe people did a great job and our rooms had a blast!  I spent most of my time in the arcade participating in random tournaments and checking out the Indie area so I cant comment on too much but I loved how approachable and friendly everyone was.  I also had the chance to participate in the nd Maglympics well st for official Magfest if you arent including minimagfest. and saw some improvements from Magclassic spreading it out over the weekend was a great improvement but I did have a few suggestionsHave equipment reserved and tested ahead of timeThere were a couple instances where the tournament was held up due to a lack of equipment or the system required updating.  A quick test about an hour before the tournament could help things run smoother.Attendance It seems like a majority of the teams did not show up for the event. Since the Magfest schedule was released after the tournament sign ups opened its possible people had panels conflicting with the tournament.  If possible maybe opening up signups a few days after the schedule is released could help with the issue as well as announcing the prize for st place ahead of time.Prizes It was great that everyone received something for taking part in the tournamentmy team was near the bottom of the list but it seemed like first place could have received something a bit more substantial for the time put in.  I believe they each received  magpoints but considering how other magfest tournaments give a higher prize for a fraction of the time it seemed unusual that all the time spent in this tournament only rewarded first place with  each.  If I remember correctly and Im probably off with the dollar amount at Magclassic st place received around  each tshirts and free passes to Magfest. Im not suggesting prizes have to be as large as bigger conventionsfestivals like PAX but an increase in the prize could also bring in extra teams and create a bigger event.The only other complaint Id have is more hotel related.  It seems we werent the only ones that had things go missing during check in but the customer service was pretty bad in that aspect.  My roommate spent the night before making batches of macaroons for everyone and while checking in and getting parking situated the bellhop offered to take her things up to the room.  During that time the macaroons were Lost in transit which is a bit hard to believe as it was a large container sitting on top of the cart.  If they had fallen they would have been noticed and would have made enough noise to be noticed as well.  We filed a complaint but that was only met with Were sorry well look into it.With being short staffed I think everyone did a great job and I cant wait for next years Magfest we just might consider staying somewhere other than the Gaylord,Magfest,d0i8cns,1,t5_2tbqi
