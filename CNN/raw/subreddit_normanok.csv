He was in an industrial accident about a year ago and the frequency of our communication began to decrease after that and has finally just stopped completely.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer so I have been dealing with those issues.  I thought of traveling out there I live in California but I dont even know where to look for him.  The Norman police have been helpfulI know he is not in jail or the morgue!Thanks for your help.,normanok,csooack,1,t5_2sikv

As I said in another commentThe right wheel well is where I usually ride. Far enough from the curb that I wont have to worry about running up on it or getting snagged by debris seriously noncyclists look at the area closest the the curb its all dust and rocks and crap that can make you crash really easily while still close enough that people can get around without any trouble.,normanok,cz72gel,1,t5_2sikv
