7887605,0,t1_d42lo3j,I am kinda curious about your opinion on something  I dont know if there is a correct answer for this or not. I am a Bernie supporter and I know that most of his supporters are like me  young white males.  His track record in terms of being a  supporter of womens right and minority rights speak for its self I think. Millennial women seem to support him but it seems like women  think that not voting for Hillary is inherently antifeminist. Bernie struggles with the black vote as well. He has the support of Killer Mike an outspoken militant rapper there are pretty amazing photos out there of Bernie and Mike having dinner together. There was also the time when an angry black woman ran on stage at one of his rallies and he let her have the mic  he just stepped back to listen. Those types of things really spoke to me about the type of man he really is and made me really optimistic about what he could do for this country. But again I am a  year old white guy. Why do you think that he never caught on with various minority groups and Gen X women? Clearly if he had more support from those groups he would have beaten Hillary easily. It just makes me a little sad that he was never really able to make an impact with them. ,TheDollop,d42n1i9,5,t5_32t40

I cant believe that  people died from this shit but thats what the resources say. The Mental Floss article claims that the reason behind the tank bursting was the man who installed it. He had no engineering or architectural background he just threw up a cheap piece of metal to hold a metric fuckton of molasses.,TheDollop,dcjuz8t,4,t5_32t40

When you go to the ends of the spectrum a fascist dictatorship isnt much different from a communist dictatorship if its focused on a cult of personality or a sole guy like Long.

The only improvement I could suggest is they travel with Jose and let him roam the stage while the show happens. Although I think paying for Joses food and travel expenses would suck all the profit out. Seals are very expensive pets. ,TheDollop,dgf44kj,8,t5_32t40
