Also Im a bit of a cheapskate so back when Mass Effect  got released I had preordered it from a different country just to save about .. the game arrived here about  weeks late DBut yeah Im guessing my game will arrive in about an hour or on Monday dont really care which as I can wait for it.,FantasyLife3ds,cksyb7n,3,t5_328nc

2023382,0,t3_2hwzht,Well my honest opinion is I havent adored a game like this in a very long time something as new and appealing as this doesnt come around very often at all and Im so glad I gave it a shot since I was pretty sceptical and only did it just in case I missed out on something great. They dont do any where near enough to sell just how impressive this game is.But the warning to this is that I LOVE grinding Ive spent  hours in pokemon x so Im just the kind of person who likes to squeeze every tiny little bit out of a game once I like it XD This game has an astonishing amount of content and I think if I dont burn out I may actually surpass that  hours record in my attempt to master all the lives. But it certainly doesnt force you to play in that way either you can easily enjoy yourself in just one life and whichever one you want. Its just a field day for a completionist like myself LOL,FantasyLife3ds,ckx0jji,4,t5_328nc

2281868,0,t3_2ldkj0,The general consensus is that there is little reason not to take on all the gathering jobs at first. All classes benefit from being able to mine and chop trees and you can progress through the ranks fairly easily just by exploring the world and miningcutting stuff you come across.They are also invaluable when it comes to crafting jobs.Carpentry is going to help you out quite a lot if you are an Angler. Technically you can purchase many rods from stores but they will always be standard quality. Crafting your own Rods will usually result in higher quality rods with better stats.You will find though that in order to progress through carpenter to build better rods that you also might want blacksmith so you can process ores you will need for other carpentry challenges.So its really up to you how deep you want the rabbit hole to go.,FantasyLife3ds,cltr8mk,6,t5_328nc

Once the main story line is complete you can respec to complete the harder challenges of each life such as mining the Dark Heart but the adept challenges should be easy for you to complete for now. ,FantasyLife3ds,cm9ly9l,3,t5_328nc

2545463,0,t3_2ouwax,It really depends on what level you are where you are in the game and if you have the DLC or not.You say you dont have the DLC so that takes a big chunk of the potential exp away. If you have beaten the story the Shadow bosses at CactoDark Void give the most exp. I dont remember if there are any EXP equips without the DLC as it has been a while since I have played without it but if you can get ahold of any of those that would help a lot as well.Also just a plug for the DLC the game has SO much more content with the DLC it is definitely worth the purchase if you are still on the fence about it.,FantasyLife3ds,cmqtuad,1,t5_328nc
