2961117,0,t3_2r8fk8,theres a few i know of that are coming but arent done.www.timespinnergame.com  timespinners  this one looks pretty sweet.  its in a fantasy setting and you manipulate time in order to progress.  not sure about the leveling system just assuming it has what youre looking for.www.aegisthegame.com  aegis defenders  this one looks really cool.  combines tower defense and metroidvania gameplay together.  pretty sure i read that this has traditional leveling during gameplay.www.omgwtfgames.net  adaeus  this game definitely has the leveling youre looking for and it looks like castlevania combat in a metroid setting.  not sure about backtracking but based on the info given so far it seems to have it.www.axiomverge.com  axiom verge  definitely doesnt have the leveling youre looking for but if you like metroidvanias for the exploration gameplay it feels wrong leaving this one out.i know you were looking for things to play right now but everyone pretty much covered all the good ones. these ones are definitely worth keeping on your radar though.,metroidvania,co4oz0i,2,t5_2tvxq

7805310,0,t3_4m74e5,Have you played salt and sanctuary?  My favorite game series are symphony of the night and the subsequent ds games and dark souls. It scratches all those itches.  Idk if you ever played sotn on the max luck mode that makes your other stats lower but thats kinda what it feels like.  ,metroidvania,d3tdmz7,2,t5_2tvxq

9028854,0,t1_d7x30p5,gt EDIT Also Cave Story isnt a metroidvania motherfuckers.I agree I dont know why its so frequently mentioned. Same with Shantae. If those are Metroidvanias somebody has to show me a definition.,metroidvania,d7x4jsp,2,t5_2tvxq
9232341,0,t1_d8dq8wd,You should probably look into remotr for android or something similar and an android TV dongle with ethernet capabilities. ,metroidvania,d8m9m6t,1,t5_2tvxq
10066583,0,t3_5jutfr,I would recommend Valdis Story  it is really the best metroidvania that Ive played in quite a while I liked it much better than Guacamelee for instance.,metroidvania,dbjp65c,12,t5_2tvxq
10105492,0,t1_dbop1zu,wow I just read some customer reviews and almost everyone who also knows the xbox and sony controllers thinks that this one is superior. Ill have to take a look in a store about how it feels to hold it. ,metroidvania,dbor9sx,2,t5_2tvxq

10967255,0,t3_5wjksy,I kind of like having to find the map. It adds to the sense of mystery when exploring a new area. I can understand why some people find it frustrating though. I think its unfortunate that some of the games features are turning people away from the game because Im really enjoying the game so far. I think this may end up being one of my favorite metroidvanias.,metroidvania,deb713y,2,t5_2tvxq
11222754,0,t1_df3jrf7,Waking Mars was one of the first games I ever played on Steam.  Its not a metroidvania but it was definitely enjoyable.,metroidvania,df432y6,3,t5_2tvxq
