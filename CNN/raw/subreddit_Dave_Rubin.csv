10302291,0,t1_dcbr22x,Sorry. I realize that its not your fault that the quality of your education is so poor. Im aware that the focus of modern schools and colleges is on indoctrination rather than education.I sincerely believe that if youre interested in gaining an actual education then you need to take it into your own hands by reading broadly.Fahrenheit  is a great starting point in understanding how real world censorship cames about.,Dave_Rubin,dcbtj9u,1,t5_3fggz

10395542,0,t1_dcmdj7a,There have been literally thousands of sanctions passed against Russia NK and Cuba however in the context of Israel the only relevant provided example is Saudi Arabia. The issue is that in large part the bombing of Palestinian citizens by the Israelis is funded by western countries and in particular the US as is also done with Saudis bombing of Yemen. There is relatively little that could be done about the previously listed countries as their human rights violations are distant from the sphere of western influence where as that of Israels are directly connected to it.  gtSaudi ArabiaBoycotting and divesting are pretty much politically impossible given their position in OPEC. Amnesty international have demanded several times that they be removed from the UN human rights panel.,Dave_Rubin,dcmeg8y,6,t5_3fggz

10707688,0,t1_ddkdt0h,gt The Free Speech Wars have begun its pretty clear he also takes up the mantle of combating authoritarianism as wellThat is not clear. I can say WWIII has begun without meaning that I will be fighting in WWIII. The title is clearly a comment on recent events UC Berkley. Trump may hurt free speech in the future but not in current events. Im not an ethically wrong person for healing a bruised knee in a cyclone I just have bad priorities. Perhaps there are things Rubin could be doing that are better. That doesnt mean what hes doing is bad. Thats still debatable Im not yet conceding Trump has been worse than the left but thats besides the point and doesnt need to be true for my argument to be true.gt If I could pull a lever to divert a trolley car away from four helpless people but abstain from doing so have I done something wrongI would describe good and wrong differently than you. It depends if you set the trolley in motion. Technically if you didnt set the trolley in motion you didnt do something wrong. You abstained from doing something good. In your absence the outcome would be no better. gt If I had his platformYoure making up situations. He went to a lot of effort to construct a platform you have not to my knowledge. So hes done more genuine good than you. To use your last analogy Rubin entered the trolley of his own effort when youve been standing on the sidelines. Then you criticize him. Its not completely inaccurate to call yourself a centrist if youre centerright. Its subjective anyway. Further neutral doesnt necessarily mean you have no opinion it just means you abstain from arguing it in certain circumstances. Out of curiosity when does Rubin refer to himself as neutral? gt If your not opposed to both then your unprincipled.Rubin clearly doesnt like Trump. But you can oppose something without taking it on. Suppose there are two bad things X and Y. I oppose both but I only take on X. Did I do a bad thing? There is now less of X but you think thats a bad thing. This whole debate came about because you were opposed to my use of the word whataboutism. You may think whataboutism is valid criticism but it doesnt make my statement wrong. ,Dave_Rubin,ddkf26x,1,t5_3fggz

10910105,0,t1_de57br5,Nah. Ive read his books and listen to most of his podcasts. There is nothing wrong with Harris hes misrepresented all over the place. A single lecture by him I watched basically transformed my life. I went kicking and screaming but the logic so clear I had no more defense. The brain is an amazing thing and my fascination but he put it all to bed that we are anything independent of the brain insofar as common ideas of religion and the afterlife go.,Dave_Rubin,de5at90,4,t5_3fggz

Keep in mind Im not trying to say that Alex isnt crazy I think he is but I am trying to say that sometimes he is correct in some of his theories... rarely but sometimes. I know it sounds like apologetics but Im not apologizing for everything or making excuses. Im pointing out that he gets taken out of context in order to drive narratives that believing curtain things are crazy. ,Dave_Rubin,dernweu,1,t5_3fggz
