2352,0,t1_ceekx79,I was wondering the same thing actually. On this specific plan we do have a shared IP. However we have another plan which I believe does not. In that case would I still be able to log in using the IP since the user would identify which site Im trying to access?,Hosting,ceepfd6,1,t5_2qt45
1028891,0,t1_chl37oo,Until very recently I worked in a DC and we found game servers challenging. They tend to attract attacks. The legitimate traffic is nonstandard and often UDP making filtering difficult. And of course they are very sensitive to latency. A normal website will still be just usable even if its getting battered and  second response times which would be catastrophic for an FPS server.I dont really have a point  Im just interested in how you get on. Good luck and defiantly work with your DC as the reality you will get service well beyond the strict scope of what they are obliged to provide if they like you. Also be realistic if your getting attacks greater than gb they will probably have no choice but to null your IP until it goes away. Unfortunately attacks like that are not uncommon. ,Hosting,chl8oa5,1,t5_2qt45

8886149,0,t3_51yto5,Im a former BlueHost VPS user and I always had major problems whenever DNS changes needed to take place. The odd thing is once I left BlueHost all of my other issues went away.  My entire point is confirm again that there are no problems at BlueHost mxtoolbox.com or an nslookup for starters then go back to open the ticket with Google. Are you able to verify this yourself by changing your DNS servers in your local machine to ... and ...? Good luck with your problem I hope it gets resolved soon! ,Hosting,d7fzmv8,1,t5_2qt45
