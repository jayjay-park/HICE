209013,0,t1_cf28pj4,I dont know that it made me think too differently about how its reported in the media I was fairly well aware of the existence of forced labor camps due to decent reporting and I cant think of anything specific about NK reporting that is particularly problematic necessarily.  Its more a matter of it making me better able to understand the situation from a groundlevel view instead of a big picture view that is easier to get ahold of from the distance that the rest of the world is at in relation to DPRK.  I think that in many cases such reporting is very general and should be much more specific involving more detailed stories about individuals.  But therein lies the problem theres so few instances of Western media being able to get access to the kinds of information we would need to do that.  In Shins case his story is fairly well reported and his book sold pretty well so I think thats a great example of the kinds of stories that need to be told.  Sadly the only way for that to happen is for more people to escape or for some other political solution be discovered that can create more defections.  If I knew the pragmatic answer to how to accomplish that Id probably be the only person on the planet who did.  And Ill answer your other question about what Id ask Shin by segueing from my above paragraph Id ask him what he thinks could be done to help get peoples stories out there because hes in a unique position to identify potential solutions.  I know hes active in human rights organizations but I dont know that Ive heard anything about what he might suggest to address such reportage.  ,BooksAMA,cf290j7,1,t5_2s4r9

6812358,0,t1_d0oc35h,Thanks this sounds pretty good.  Id find it interesting for the censorsubverting critique aspect alone but it sounds like theres a lot more appealing to it anyway.  Putting it on my list.,BooksAMA,d0oh7po,1,t5_2s4r9
