1914219,0,t1_ckfzm7h,Alright thanks thats what I was worried about. Ive never done black before. My hair is currently a light brown with a couple bleached blocks on the side where I usually put in my color. Would it eventually wash out by itself like the other Manic Panic colors Ive used?,HairDye,ckjumxj,1,t5_2wn4a

8794092,0,t3_50khsh,A vibrant purple or a dark blue would probably be wonderful. Hard to tell without actually seeing you but just based off that info I would definitely say nothing pastel. Stick to a vibrant or dark cool tone. Hope I could help!,HairDye,d74xiqp,1,t5_2wn4a
