150690,0,t3_1u1g66,I made a film about hiking the JMT a few years back. You can watch it here! My advice would be to read up as much as you can to start with.  miles a day is definitely possible. You will probably want to do more once you get acclimated. Basically it boils down to about one pass per day. Wake up go over the pass hike down sleep. You will not be stashing food anywhere. You are required to carry your food in a bearproof canister. They can hold about  days worth of food.There are resupply points at Reds Meadow Vermillion Ranch ferry and a place called Muir Trail Ranch where you can for a fee send a  gallon bucket of food in the mail to pick up when you get there. Muir Trail Ranch is at about the halfway point. There is no store to buy food there though! There are hiker boxes where people leave unwanted food though.Permits are tricky too but can be acquired.Here is a list of the gear we brought with us.You can see more short clips from our film here. Definitely the trip of a lifetime! Go for it!,hiking,cevleyq,2,t5_2r9om

661371,0,t3_21pxlg,Im surprised REI is able to compete actually. For awhile the small manufacturers couldnt get their products to market but the Internet has made them them much more competitive. A couple months ago I spent about  at REI but ended up returning everything but the shoes  I found superior products for less money via smaller manufacturers that only sold online. Just look at GoLite  the Jam cost twice as much when sold through REI. Now that its sold online its one of the most inexpensive packs on the market and much lighter than anything offered in REI. The problem these manufacturers still have is that theres no one stop place to find them all so its inconvenient to compare their products and difficult to know who makes what. But even thats changing. Trail amp Era is trying to create an online hub  theyve got Gossamer ZPacks and Klymit aboard so far I believe. Garage Grown Gear just started last week and is attempting to create a manufacturer directory.For smaller outfitters my local shop just has a price matching policy.

1019046,0,t1_chjsh9p,OK as someone who is around black bears just about every day during work I do feel the need to qualify the above a bit. I fly helicopters in northern BC and Alberta and land in remote areas every day which leads to  times as many bear encounters as I have ever had hiking so I feel that I can claim at least some experience on the matter.Generally you are quite right black bears are shy coward and will leave people alone unless they smell food and see an easy opportunity. However statements like thisgtunless you have heard of food shortages and recent bear attacks it is not something to worry about.gtYou dont need bear spray.are a bit dangerous.Bears even bears in the same area are all different. They all have different personalities different experiences with humans and their food they have different moods depending on the time of the day and when they last ate. They can be grumpy very much so. They can be desperate enough to actively hunt humans as food. Young males just like human young males are usually quite a bit braver than more experienced animals. This especially applies right now as they awaken from hibernation and are sometimes quite desperate for food but it is also true during fall.A woman in Alberta was killed by a large male black bear last week. By all accounts this was an older animal. She was with  other people who all yelled and screamed at the bear it didnt give a fuck. This is thought to be a predatory attack so obviously this particular bear didnt follow any of the common bear rules and it wasnt the first one to do so gtThe attack was predatory. It doesnt appear that the bear was provoked by humans. Our investigation also yielded no evidence suggesting that there were garbage or other attractants at the site that might have attracted the bear Cox said.Anyone in bear country wed really encourage them to carry bear spray at all times when theyre outdoors and to know how to use it. Its a highly effective tool in any bear encounter situation.Read more They didnt have any means to defend themselves or her. Once it happens you cant negotiate or beg the bear to let you go. It wont listen to you. All you can do is fight the bear or die and in this case a can of bear spray could have saved her live. This post now sounds exactly like the statements you are referring to above tend to blow the danger of wildlife and bears in particular out of proportion but it is necessary since your post is in my opinion downplaying the risk quite a bit. I commonly hear things like that from people that have a lot of hiking experience but I think this often leads to them underestimating the risks associated with bears. The workers we fly around are the same... they think because the bears ran off the last  times they saw one that will always be the case.... but then just last year we had a medevac for a guy who was quite literally missing half his face after an attack.The chances of a predatory attack are extremely low maybe a bit higher for a child but that doesnt mean you shouldnt take bear spray with you and know how to use it. The chances of a car crash as you said are also pretty low but that doesnt mean you dont need to wear the seatbelt. The tiny risk would never stop me from hiking anywhere just like the risk of a crash doesnt stop me from driving or flying for that matter. But seriously a can of mace is like  and weighs a few ounces. Edit Seems appropriate to add this there is a young black bear about yd from the room in the camp I am sitting in right now. I flew directly over his head several times today every time I landed and took off here. He got used to the noise after about the second time and stopped caring.,hiking,chk4fcj,5,t5_2r9om

Whatever the case everybody pays them to varying degrees.  A couple friends have been sent home recently due to the taxman.  Bad knees claimed Pinch and a bad hip got Goosebumps.  A normal day is ish miles and ish feet of elevation gain a big day is  miles and over a vertical mile of gain and a small day is under  a thousand feet or less of gain...Some of the tolls Ive paid so farI had to pay the toll for not filtering . liters of water.  Ive had a pack rash for over  miles that is constantly rubbed raw and stinging  from sweat and then one giant scab when if get a day off.  Ill never forget the vicious foot pain that started week two and bordered on unbearable and has only recently dulled to a constant ache.  At the end of the day when I sit down after finishing making camp it feels like someone is sticking hot pokers into each of my hips and I can only sit in one position for a few minutes before I start squirming around into the next one I have decided my hips are my weak point much like a large breed dog. I was dead legged on the left side due to a blown up Achilles between Agua Dulce and Hikertown.  And again from a blown up knee coming out of the last half of The Sierra.  This is the cost of getting to see the most spectacular things you can imagine over what is in reality a very short time.The second half of The Sierra was incredible pain notwithstanding.  In fact it was so incredible that Yosemite was a mosquito infested letdown though in fairness I didnt go into the tourist laden valley which is supposed to be spectacular.  South Lake Tahoe was next and that town will forever be remembered fondly because we got to mail our bear canisters home from there.  Mongoose and I split from the group there so we could do some bigger miles we both want to have a little time to play with in Oregon where most people make up time and weve been flying together.  On to Sierra City where our map had a note telling us that there is an old lecherous man in town that invites you to shower at his house and apparently then gets into it with you.  We didnt accept any shower offers from strangers.  Then to Belden a dilapidated resort town with fantastic cheeseburgers and a ft climb out of town.  That night we got some water from a spring where a bunch of people were camped and the next day Nye told us she thought their camp had been stalked by a bear.Of course the taxman could take everything if he wanted...The next night Mongoose and I camped at the west branch of bear trap creek.  We had done a ton of miles and were completely exhausted and after dinner I was falling asleep as I was laying down onto my sleeping pad...I dont know a thruhiker that doesnt sleep with their food.  We carry too much to fit into a bear can hanging it doesnt work and the general thought is that  bears are overgrown raccoons if you leave it out theyll take it but if you defend it theyll leave you alone.A couple hours later I woke to the sound of huge footfalls on the pine duff next to my tent and then the sound of a giant muzzle sniffing at the wall.  I instantly regretted being a food defender.  The fear was light and overwhelming.  It was up at my head and allencompassing.  I sat boltupright and the bear skittered off away from my tent.  I could see him so clearly in my mind behind the tent walls hungry and interested.  I shouted HEY!!!  GET OUT OF HERE!!!  And he left.I lay back down the sound of my heart blasting in my ears.  Two minutes later hes back.  Im fucked.Hey Mongoose!!His voice is groggy with sleep.  Yeah?Weve got a bear in camp.Oh shit dude.What do I do? I dont know.  Keep talking man.Fuck.  I feel helpless.And I did.  I cant ever remember feeling more so.  Here I am laying here at the mercy of a hungry bear waiting for him to decide what to do.Hes over here now!!!So I decided to get up and do something.  Theres nothing worse than laying there feeling like a helpless victim.  Anythings better than that.I put on sandals clothes and got up to run the son of a bitch out of camp.  I walked toward Mongooses tent and shined my light.  There were two eyes reflected back at me.  Then I turned up my light.A motherfucking deer.  A big doe.  Bambis mom. The worlds least terrifying animal.  I couldnt believe it.  I didnt believe it for a second.  But then it set in.The mind is a terrible master.  It can make anything real especially all of its fears all of the taxes it thinks it has to pay.  Of course sometimes the taxman is just a sheep in wolfs clothing...Big dirty.And yes Im still sleeping with my food,hiking,cjnse96,3,t5_2r9om

Starting solo backpacking though so it may apply differently to you idk pampnbspBe sure to gauge up and get a good set of gear if youre planning on hoofing it a few days at high elevation. Make sure you spend the time breaking in gear and seeing what works for you when youre out using it. The weather gets pretty eratic and weird CO iknorite. Mainly you want to have wind and rain blocksgear as well as bug gear and insulationgood underlayers. Youll want to look into if the places youre going to requires bear bagging or bear canister as well if bag I recommend the PCT Method Youtube.ampnbspThere are a lot of trails you can do. As far as beginner Im not sure but its much easier if youre going as a group shared load. One option is section hiking the Colorado Trail Runs from Denver to Durango?. A lot of it is k but section hiking doesnt mean youre doing it all.I plan on utilizing the National Forests for free campingtrails. Its free to camp as long as you follow a set of rules. Most important is Leave no trace but theres more to it yet not hard to grasp. Theyre only in place to ensure the least amount of impact on the environment.TLDRTheres a lot of options in COOne that comes to mind for a hike is the Flatirons.

4087680,0,t1_crlyb00,Yet a gun is useless in close encounters too.The only way a gun would help you is if you never let someone come within  ft of you if they have a knife theyll reach and kill you before your gun can do anything.Considering that you have to walk past people on trails thats impossible to keep  ft distance from every possible attacker.Pepper or bear spray is probably the most effective solution.,hiking,crm7yf9,2,t5_2r9om
4094579,0,t3_37d7xp,Ive been hiking by myself for a few years now and I prefer it  the serenity is quite refreshing. Ive never backpacked multiday hiking and I usually carcamp if Im by myself  sleeping in a car is safer... Sometimes I use Meetup for hikes... The biggest problem I see when hiking alone is to either be too alertscared or be too engrossed in yourself that you lose spatial awareness. When youre with others you tend to engage in conversation to keep your brain active. Come up with your own stuff to stay alert. I sometimes whistle or think aloud or talk to myself. The other end of the spectrum you could get too scared to go through a small bush or too alert over even a leaf rustle. Youll build up trust in your interpretation of natures sounds as you hike more. In my mind there are  types of trails  urban trails in parks within or in close proximity to a big city and trails in national parks. Urban trails get a lot of foot traffic and even though youre hiking by yourself you arent really alone. Trails in national parks are different. Sometimes you wont even see another human being for hours. These NP trails are also a bit more wild in terms of plant growth amp animals. Obviously its a lot simpler if youre going on urban trails.Ive hiked alone in bear amp mountain lion country Canada amp US. While I havent had an encounter or even a sighting yet sigh you should always be prepared duh!. Bear spray will help but cans have an expiry date and you have to be careful about where you store it. Always know how to deal with sudden animal encounters. Most often animals are just as surprised to meet you as you are. If youre being stalked then thats a different story. Basically dont run  back away slowly go the other way and make yourself look bigger. Although I guess our panic reactions would be a lot different I always carry a knife for personal safety. Many think that animals are the most dangerous on the trails. While that is true you have to think about other people. Humans in my mind are the most dangerous animals you could encounter. All the humans Ive met on trails have been extremely helpful but youre old enough to know the world isnt a hunkydorey happy place. Sometimes I pick up a big stick on the trail  doubles as a walking stick and in animalpeople emergencies.I also always carry a basic med kit a portable light cellphone charger mirror amp thermal space blanket and a full L water pack. I always run a trip logger on my phone and keep tabs on how much distance Ive covered. Over time you get used to it and can guesstimate time amp distance. You need to know the area youre hiking beforehand  be familiar with the terrain weather closures areas to avoid trail names amp intersections youll pass. If possible read up about the trail from reviews or blogs. Talk to a ranger before you begin your hike  let them know youll be alone. Build up a mental image of the route. Its your choice to tell someone where youre going its a good idea... I dont. I just go... To build up comfort to hiking by yourself go on familiar or urban trails with some people around. You wont be able to chitchat with anyone and itll help you get accustomed to being by yourself. Then slowly build up confidence by hiking on unfamiliar trails but slightly popular trails and then do trails in national parks. In the end I should tell you the most important thing always trust your instincts. This is something youll learn over time. If you dont feel comfortable going somewhere or doing something just dont do it. Youre not proving anything to anyone youre alone  tldr Hiking alone is awesome fun. Enjoy it but take safety precautions... always know where you hike beforehand use your best judgement and be prepared.EDIT Added the tldr section  Didnt expect my comment to turn into a short story!,hiking,crn09zv,1,t5_2r9om

If you make it up to that saddle you can scramble up that ridge to the left not as bad as it looks and drop into Silver Lake in the adjoining valley to the East  its a steep and long talus slope but doable and come back past the Mount Townsend trailheads and right back to your car.

Im trying to lessen the extent of that while letting them retain the enjoyment of the experience in order to improve the chance that they find the outdoors great. Heavy loads make unhappy hikers. Unhappy hikers have a bad experience. People that have bad experiences in the outdoors dont want to go back to the wilderness. Your asinine lists also tell people to carry  liters of water snake bite kits giant first aid kits and all manner of useless crap that i cant even start to list.

If it sounds like Im shitting on the trail builders and maintainers Im really not.  Ive maintained trail and I know how much effort that would be to correct.  Give me a six person backcountry crew and the bottom three miles of that trail would take at least six weeks to get into a somewhat passable state but Id rather have a ten person crew and three months to get it as near Pacific Crest Trail maintenance standards as it can be without rerouting the trail.  That trail surely doesnt get enough traffic to warrant so much attention so itll remain a tougher rugged trail.  Thats okay.

Previously I thought that my vision depth perception was getting poor at altitude but after a previous hike I think that that is related to not drinking enough water.

5872272,0,t3_3vmqvu,I have had issues with my left knee and patellofemoral syndrome for almost  years now. Ive gone through periods where I have pain for a couple weeks but it always goes away eventually. Make sure to not do any kind of activities that might make it worse take some time off from hiking dont even walk more than you have to etc and take an antiinflammatory medicine and ice it. When the pain goes away ease back into hiking and being active. Slowly build up to longer miles again and if you feel any kind of pain take a few daysweeks off. Trekking poles will also take some of the stress off your knees when hiking. ,hiking,cxpdxgd,1,t5_2r9om

Hillsound crampons are a more robust version of microspikes and many consider them to be the gold standard below true crampons.  Petzl makes great crampons overall for more serious applications imo.  Next step is snowshoes if theres deep powder.  MSR Evo is the base model and works great for most applications but it lacks a heel lift.  I have the Tubbs Flex VRT because I love the bindings.

6379676,0,t3_42lya4,Heres a few recommendations for you in Socal Central CA and Norcal.Try Black Star Canyon in Orange and Crystal Cove in Laguna Beach. Black Star is a more strenuous hike than Crystal Cove but if it happens to rain youll be rewarded with a really nice waterfall and caves at the end of the trail.Between LA and SF you can go to SequoiaKings Canyon park and check out the trails there. I backpacked around Big Baldy a few summers back and that was pretty fun. If youre looking for a shorter day hike in the roughly  mile radius area Id recommend Sturtevant Falls near Arcadia. You can do that before or after Griffith.Not too familiar with Norcal hikes but you could check out Castle Crags State park if youre willing to drive a few hours north of Sacramento. Had a lot of fun hiking there last summer.Bring a buddy with you and stay safe on the trails! If you want to know more Id be happy to answer any questions you have.,hiking,czesu65,1,t5_2r9om

You can add an emergency blanket between the ground and the sleeping mat to increase the RValue the reflection level.

It helps you get in the aerobic zone which boosts endurance without getting completely wiped out.But beware that its easy to injure yourself when you first get started running especially if youre a big guy.  Also you need to have realistic expectations.  Theres only so much that you can do to improve your fitness in  days.Take it easy the week before the hike.  Your body will need time to recover from any training youve done.  It takes more than a week to benefit from a workout so last minute workouts will only tire you out.,hiking,d2796f1,2,t5_2r9om

7956006,0,t1_d4a6e24,The hike was beautiful but had some challenges. We encountered snow at the top of the three passes which forced some scrambling and temporary route finding. Mystic pass was by far the worst on the southeast side with snow a meter deep in some parts. We also had some trouble with losing the path towards pulsatilla pass from flood damage and at the base of Boulder pass the path was washed out. We lost the path for roughly three hours. If it had been foggy and we didnt have a gps and navigation skills we would have been lost at Boulder. We pushed the km hike in five days and I would do it again. We went in the direction from Norqway to Louise and I would not recommend doing it backwards. As for scenery it was beautiful. The only day we didnt enjoy was day  as we spent the entire day hiking through thick forest with hardly any elevation for  km. ,hiking,d4abvvu,2,t5_2r9om

They also have a simple but decent smartphone app. The downside is that since its crowd sourced and barely a year old there might not be a lot in your area. You also might want to check out MTBProject. Same thing but mountainbike trails but since it was the first iteration of their database and is a few years older it tends to have a lot more trails and many are mixed use they also have a trail running skiing and mountaineering versions but I have no idea how big these databases are,hiking,d4fqw6u,1,t5_2r9om

8316641,0,t3_4tfbz7,Yosemite is not particularly close to either LA or SF if you dont have a car. If you can take a bus to Merced or Fresno then you can hop on a YARTS bus to Yosemite from there. That whole process will probably eat up most of a day depending on bus schedules.Once in Yosemite it definitely doable to do pointtopoint hikes using public transportation. One option is to start up in Tuolomne Meadows accessible via NPS shuttle and take the JMTPCT south towards Mammoth Lakes. Youll cross over into the Ansel Adams Wilderness and can take a variety of routes down to Mammoth Lakes to catch a YARTS bus back to the park. Definitely requires careful planning using the bus schedules but its a spectacular stretch of trail and very worthwhile. Additionally there are plenty of loop hikes that start and end within the park with trailheads accessible via the NPS shuttle. A classic loop is the Clark Range in the southeastern part of the park a ish day loop which starts near Glacier Point and ends in Yosemite Valley. There are also a variety of loops in the northern part of the park that start and end on Highway  again accessible via the NPS shuttle. A classic one is the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. The  Lakes loop is also very nice. Another option that would be much easier to access from SF would be to backpack in Point Reyes National Seashore.,hiking,d5h4xd2,1,t5_2r9om

9012403,0,t3_53nife,Youre just here for  days so will have to space your hikes out a bit. This site will be very helpful in picking places that meet your fitness level. Personally Id suggestTable Mountain very hard is my favorite Gorge hike. Amazing view from the top but it is a tough one. If you want to do Oneonta its extremely short like  mile in and back do it early in the morning on the way to Table Mt. There is also a hot spring spa at the bottom of Table Mt. If you want to treat yourself after you get down you can do a hot bath and towel wrap afterward. Eagle Creek is beautiful and flat. You can really vary it up from punchbowl falls m to High Bridge .M to Tunnel Falls M but AMAZING and if you do Tunnel you should go a little further to Twister Falls .M. This can be a nice rest day hike after something like Table Mt. Another great Gorge hike any way you cut it. Note that there is a bridge out and the trail is officially closed but that is easily gotten around and many people do it. Silver Star Eds Trail loop in Washington if you have a high clearance vehicle the road to the trailhead is very deeply rutted and hasnt been maintained for years. If you do this one make sure you hit up the Indian Pits about a half mile past the summit. Better view imo. McNeil Point is a great Mt. Hood hike. Id highly recommend backpacking in and staying the night.  On a clear day Saddle Mountain is another fantastic hike. Great view of the Pacific Ocean and the cascades.  I also recommend getting up to Helens. Recommend the Johnston Ridge hike for a view of the blast zone.,hiking,d7v5faj,3,t5_2r9om

In posts like this youll get a lot of recommendations of boots that work for other people. They may love em but it has zero impact on that boot working for you.         About the wintersummer thing... I have . My winter boots Keen brand have Thinsulate insulation and keep me happy in nonactive times down to F. My regular boots Asolo brand are not insulated but leather and goretex.       Then I have trail runners for the rest of the time.

11589539,0,t3_65eub7,If youre a part of the meetup group can you ask a similar question in that group? Is there a message thread or something like on meetup.com? The whole point of those groups are to be inclusive and to help more people get outdoors the people in them are generally enthusiastic about teaching and helping. Its probably a good idea to introduce yourself and ask questions there youll get a sense of who you can go to with more questions by who responds. I think one reason youre not finding a ton of info on hiking  is because its pretty darn simple. On shortmedium distance day hikes its pretty hard to royally screw up especially in a group. My advice would be to use the meetup group to build a little more confidence and as a safe place to learn some of the skills that you want to.Theres some good advice hereMore on backpacking and overnights but has a solid section on day hikes and if you ever want to do overnights that process for getting started is pretty solid and ramps you up slow and steady.As far as what to bring I would absolutely bring sunscreen maybe an extra layer or something depending on the weather and a camera or something to take photos with.,hiking,dg9ok6p,3,t5_2r9om

What isnt their to like about the power granted to the president by congress that has been used to protect and preserve some of our countries greatest places.  The Grand Canyon was originally a monument local regressive fools called its preservation a diabolical scheme  just like they attach Bears Ears and Grand StaircaseEscalante. As soon as a reservation is once created then the thieves and the devil and his relations come forward to attack it.These temple destroyers devotees of ravaging commercialism seem to have a perfect contempt for Nature and instead of lifting their eyes to the God of the mountains lift them to the Almighty Dollar. John Muirgt I feel like this is going nowhere. Your comment history suggests you spend the vast majority of your time on reddit arguing with people so Im going to stop here.
