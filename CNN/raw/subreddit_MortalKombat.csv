1429707,0,t1_civg8ss,Yeah I believe balance is obviously very important personally I dont believe MK was quite as imbalanced as a lot of people make out. Kenshi and Freddy were worse than Kabal IMO as they were just next to impossible match ups for characters like Baraka. I think Kabal is best obviously but Kenshi Freddy and Cyrax seem have bigger issues Kabal is just an all round great character. His zoning isnt a huge problem when you learn to dash block it his pressure is meh his footsies are incredible though.Anyway I digress to keep the game competitive I sort of think NRS have to be active in trying to keep it competitive.

Also software has the most bugs right upon its first release and in the case of fighting games character balance still has a lot to be worked out.  Its usually smart to wait for the first patch before purchasing new software.Game publishers these days are trying to punish you for being smart in this way by taking away a part of the game unless you agree to pay for it on day one.  Dont be fooled by their wording its not a bonus you receive for preordering.  Its a part of a full game that publishers decide to take away for wanting to wait.Preorders had a purpose back in the day when you had to worry about not getting a copy on day one if you wanted it.

The reason a shitstorm came about is because every old gen player collectively let out their sadness about the issue.  High Voltage presumably told WB there were complications with releasing it on time and asked WB if it were okay to delay the release.  Thats how this stuff works.  WB sets the timeline for release and devs do their best to get it out by that date.  In this case it couldnt happen.  Do you really think High Voltage would put out a statement saying they were delaying the game without WBs consent?  WB are the face of the game in a way since theyre the ones helping HV and NRS put it on shelves.  Thats what WBs role here is.

So as the story is progressing hes becoming more unhinged by having to use his powers.Itll be interesting to see how he keeps a lid on it as the story progresses or if he even will be able to.

At Canada Cup  I saw some dude playing MK on a keyboard that he somehow managed to hook up to a  and I think he went on to Top  the tournament.  The point is youll be able to find success with any input device as long as you practice. That isnt to say you should force yourself to play on a pad if you hate it. You should try a stick out to see if you like it more first but dont go and spend a couple hundred dollars on a fightstick just because you think its necessary to compete. I use a stick for every fighting game because thats what Ive been doing for  years at this point but I think Im going to try pad out for MKX because I hated buster charging in UMvC and thats basically what having the block button be on top of a stick makes you do.

But I live in the US and I simply just dont believe minorities are treated all that badly by comparison. Sure they are treated badly. Everybodys friggin treated badly. Some people have it worse than others. Sometimes those people are gay sometimes theyre not. Its absolutely terrible in some parts of the world. But as far as the st world goes Id say everybodys just about equal. Its money that decides whos a minority and who isnt.

3707064,0,t1_cqes8lr,Its about visibility leading to normalization and acceptance. Its not just a matter of equality its about being put at as huge disadvantage as someone who is out could be put in danger not just physically but socially and professionally. There is an appeal to not giving a shit but to assume that we get to not caring simply by existing at letting things go like they always have ignores a huge variety of social factors. The more charactersleaderspublic figures you have identifying with a community the more variety you can showcase in that community. Historically minorities in media outlets have been presented as deviant or basic reflections of mostly negative stereotypes. Kung Jin is stubborn talented brash knowledgeable gay honorable and can be bit of a jerk. All those things form a cohesive whole. At no point is he presented as gay being more important than those things but for someone who is gay and doesnt have many examples its cool to have it treated as being something that you can be not something that you shouldnt be.,MortalKombat,cqetwxj,3,t5_2robf

As for his rush I use Shirai Ryu sorry if I spelled that wrong so I can have a decent whip usage as well as melee combos add that to his ability to teleport and you have opponents guessing what the hell you are gonna do.,MortalKombat,cqg2v64,1,t5_2robf

3737515,0,t1_cqiamhm,Theres a finite number of combos in any fighting game regardless of frames. It theoretically cannot be infinite unless moves are somehow genre revolutionizing created by themselves I do understand what youre getting at though. And anyway even if you did have Tekken level frame data you would still find some of the best combos  hours into training or practice mode. Competitively it doesnt matter. Look at early fighting games movelists that can be memorized in  minutes yet still played professionally.There is no point in this argument it reminds me of the internet as a whole and arguing about things that are pointless.  trillion lions Vs the Sun.,MortalKombat,cqiauft,1,t5_2robf

It is irrelevant you are going to want to use a faction kill ha ha. If you land at least a couple of strings you are essentially guaranteed  koins a match.

In one of your other replies youre saying X Rays are OP.  Im so confused.  X Rays are the opposite of OP they cost all your meter to do something that requires zero or maybe one meter.

Where do you think characters like Eddie Gordo come from?The fact that Tekken Tag  and Soul Calibur  have smaller communities and STILL matchmake better is a testament to Namcos superior netcode.  The smaller a playerbase gets the HARDER it generally is to find good matches due to there being a lower pool of players with good connections to pull from.To put it into perspective  MKX players should mean that there are guys living  miles from me who I can play with little to no latency.The problem is that NRS implemented NO KIND OF LATENCYRELATED MATCHMAKING.Whereas other fighting game developers try to match you with lowlatency players NRS just plops you into any old match.  This means a player in New York could be matchmaked with a player in the boondocks of California whose internet connection is held together by bubble gum and tape. Why?  Why cant a New Yorker play with a New Yorker when the playerbase is k?  Theres no reason why not other than BAD coding.,MortalKombat,cqypr58,1,t5_2robf

You pretty much need to burn EX constantly to get any good strings going.For Kotal Kahn you have to start a chain with a fast attack and then work into your slow attacks during a juggle. With Blood God you can do absolutely stupid damage by just doing f d. If you are buffed damage totem and cut yourself these two attacks deal  damage with very little skill or timing when buffed. Its also pretty quick. For slow characters vs. fast characters in general you need to be on top of your blocking game. Block until you have a chance to punish if a guy is super aggro.

Goros Lair with goro brutality he is sitting watching and if done right you will throw them to goro and he will tear them in half Interactables Skulls corpse sword.Kahns Koliseum shao kahn is sitting at his throne Kira Li Mei Skarlet or Ashrah are chained up only  of them its random just like in mk Shang Tsung Motaro guards and baraka can be seen watching near Kahns chairthrone. Brutality you throw the enemy near Kahn and like in mk when Kitana refuses to kill the opponent he does the same green energy thing. Interactables Guard rock Chain.The Kourtyard. Pretty much the same with the masked guards monks and Shang Tsung watching.Interactables Masked guard spear Gong Gong brutality as well you just bang their face on it multiple timesThe Dead Pool. Very basic just the same dead pool upgraded. Uppercut brutality and the fly into the acid. Interactables Chains can be used to stun and swing Skeleton Fleshy hand reaching out of the acid onto the stage if grabbed you will throw a skeleton with a bloody fleshy hand at the enemy. Subway basically just the mk version cleaned up with more posters to things like ninja mime. Brutalities if you slam them on the pillar they become dizzy and walk into a train. Or you just do it like its mk.Interactables Pillar very basic you just grab the enemy and slam them into it. Hobo you throw him if enhanced he will stab the enemy and give a little bit of stun time. Dark prison. Just the same but with more cells and kameos see what I did there? pretty klever Interactables On the very left side there is a prisoner that you can tear the arm off of and throw at or hit the other player with. For random places if you stand near a cell like in deception the prisoners will grab you and stun you. Living Forest again mostly the same. Smoke and cyber smoke randomly peak behind a tree then dissapear. Brutality you grab the other player and throw them into the mouth of a tree.

Some of them are on startup some are for during the contact and some frames are spent after the strike whether blocked or not. These are the frames it takes for your character to return to state  idle state.That after strike animation can be cancelled hence cancelling by performing a special move. In order to do it you need to perform your combo and then input the special move before the final strike of the combo connects. Youll then cancel the recovery animation and jump right into the special.Anyone find any mistakes feel free to correct me and please someone answer some more of this crap preferably in an ELI format because I want to know.,MortalKombat,creb9g0,2,t5_2robf

Be happy Ermac and Tsung got ANY mention.Im not saying youre wrong. I just find it odd that you expect them to flesh it out beyond character namedrops and background sidegame hints.

Once you have the Kamidogu youll get the option to use it while standing in front of the portal.

Worst case scenario with variations you get a character with only  good one and thats the exact same as not having variations. Not really a big deal. Best case your character now has options to deal with bad matchups not possible without variations. So no real downside and a ton of upside.Its not really fair to look at bits and pieces of different variations and say if this was just one character Id like it a lot more.

It doesnt help you if you mash and the run comes out properly every once in awhile. You need to build muscle memory and that cannot happen if your hand doesnt know what is actually successful. Another thing is giving yourself downtime. If you want to continue with mk play a different character grind towers or something but give your mind space to grow.

Its like saying a slight punch in the arm jokingly after a loss is acceptable but only if its slightly ok well whats consider slightly to a bigger dude comparable to a smaller dude? Obviously thats far fetched but Im reasoning with you. Its too gray. It reminds me of a tourney I sparred in once where light kicks to the head were permitted but if you make your opponent bleed youre DQd well I went up against a guy who was a half a foot taller than me and he rocked me in the face with a kick. I fell straight to my knees didnt bleed but could hardly standing up. The ref didnt call it and ultimately I lost. Made me incredibly bitter about sparring in tournaments after that because I thought that if he kicked me hard enough to essentially knock me out it is no longer a light kick to the head. Just thinking about it now kinda irritates me. ButI digress this isnt about me thats just an example of those gray areas where shit is tricky and needs to be solidified and no room for questioning. ,MortalKombat,csbnthu,2,t5_2robf

But one of my better childhood memories was the day my dad and me then all of  or  years old beat the whole Konquest mode for Deadly Alliance. Its trust trust that you raised your children to know the difference between real and fake and the difference between wrong and right.

4405199,0,t3_3bhiei,Buffering is the term though buffering refers to the act of inputting commands in general.In MKX if you hold back for too long before doing the b youll have to reinput back for the bf. This is not the case in every other D fighter on the planet Which count held directions towards the purposes of special moves so theres not really a term for it aside from buffering. You could say that the Back input unbuffers if you hold it for too long.In SFIV as an example Ryu can hold crouch for as long as he want. This makes it easy for players to do things like cr.MKHadouken while never having to input Down twice. It also makes cancelling specials from moves like d far less painful. ,MortalKombat,csm78cq,6,t5_2robf

4443484,0,t3_3bygik,This is bullshit. I mean ya certain people may be mad but in my opinion being a moderator does not give those guys the right to break the website for everyone without even trying to get the majorities input. If they want to take a stance on something thats all fine and dandy but myself and i am sure many others do not want it affecting us personally. Make your point as  a user and if a large portion of others agree with it then the upvotes will show it. This whole blocking the subreddits bullshit is uncalled for.ampnbsp Once a subreddit breaks k subscribers there should be some other procedure to set it private if it was not private to begin with. The admin that was fired was probably a great person but people throwing a temper tantrum and negatively affecting peoples site experience is going to eventually make this place too irritating to deal with. This is obviously just my opinion but i am sick of the bullshit. ampnbspAnother thing that has been bothering me is Ellen Pao or whatever her name is. I mean seriously the amount and depth of derogatory stuff said about that woman regardless of what she did was and still is ridiculous.ampnbspIn my opinion the moderators that are blocking parts of this website need to pulled from the position and replaced by people who can deal with a situation like this professionally instead of petulant divas who do not understand what moderate entails. There are places to discuss and deal with these issues without involving people that just want to use reddit without all the internal conflict.ampnbspP.S I am sorry for the long ass post that i am sure does not belong here i am just frustrated with the continuing bullshit that is making this website more and more irritating as time goes by.ampnbspP.S.S uLagunaGTO thank you for keeping this subreddit out of the BS.

Set your control to the other character say liu kang then set the dummy to reversal mode on and do that string to them f for example.

4520590,0,t3_3cwcdk,The thing with Rain however is NRS said the chances of a past DLC being DLC again are extremely low so Rain and Skarlet have little to no chance of being DLC. That said here is my list.. Sareena. She could use a reboot is female and they could fix her wrongs from past games.Fujin MK character in a game that deals with MK events.HavikBig league in the comic and he wont die so he has a relatively high chance. .Reiko Same as Havik.Plus all these characters fit the theme of MKX. I dont think IMO cyborgs fit the theme of MKX NRS is trying to achieve and this is why they are barely mentioned and arent talked about by Ed Boon. Just my thought though. Im sure Noob is dead after that Soulnado so that eliminates him. Smoke is in a Faction Kill so that eliminates him. Baraka is dead plus theyd have to revamp him a lot like Tanya. They wouldnt put sindel unless they completely changed her like Tanya as well. Overall story NPCs have low chances.,MortalKombat,ct0gngn,3,t5_2robf

Just stick with it play more matches and eventually youll make the online world fear Reptile.EDIT For tips on Reptile I suggest checking out   or  and ,MortalKombat,ctdxqfw,3,t5_2robf
4631538,0,t3_3edovb,I started out playing online and decided on using SubZero  Unbreakable because i thought it was cool. Unbreakable isnt a very good variant unless you are getting zoned and i was taking a lot of losses...that is..until i found the flaw of  of all online players They cant block for shit. To put things into perspective i often put up a very good fight vs players i have  winning chance against i now have a record of about  and i almost never lose decisively  rounds in a row.On the other side I dont know any combo that does more then about  damage i cant cancel into combos for shit and i never use meter specials. How do i win do you ask? Well i just find patterns in characters and learn to block them and i counter with the good ol highlow game. Basically i try to get a character down on the ground. This is kinda easy with either a jumpin kick a slide great move Reptile can do it toosweep a trow or a quick highlowhigh combo.    Then he is all mine I crouch by his beaten body and do quick low kicks  which he will start blocking and i know i got him. I chip away  hits the first time then i stand up and kick him in the face with a highlowhigh combo to get him off his feet again then i go low again with a couple of kicks this time he wont expect me to do the same thing so i do it again. This guy is getting pretty mad i just hit him twice when he could have blocked so he thinks he found a pattern and will expect me to a highlowhigh. So he will crouch block and wait for me to highlowhigh and block which is obviously a mistake because i will kick him in the shins not  or  times but until i am out of range then i jump in and kick ...or maybe ill slide...or maybe ill grab him. And let me tell you something people cant block jump kicks if it could save their lives which it would. So i jump in a couple of times with a kick if i can pull it off i follow it up with a slide. This guy is getting pretty angry i am shoving my thumb up his arse so i press harder. The important thing is to learn your opponent a pattern then do a countercounter. I use down kicks and jumpin kicks to initiate with and then i switch it up to drive him crazy. I use grabs jumpup kicks slidessweeps ice balls barrier of frost and overhead attacks and just break him down to a pile of ruble so i can remove his ugly head from his shoulders with a headrip.    I feel like combos are overrated because you will soon enough learn how players initiate the  combos they mastered and you will counter them easily. Especially considering most players use the same combos. Like the Jason one low kick into overhead x into a grab. Every Jason i meet does this so they are just free wins. They hit you a couple of times with their special breakers but thats out of sheer desperation. There are a couple of people out there who really know how to block. These guys will give you a harder time and you will need to learn to use abilities that counter a quick counterattack like barrier of frost. That is the only time i use my shitty combo to beat them up. The problem with people learning combos is that they miss a lot of basics. Most people cant jumpin kick. Most people dont know how to block a jumpin kick. Most people cant time etc. etc. Dont start up reading on techstrategies master the basics first then do stuff the pros do. ,MortalKombat,ctediwz,2,t5_2robf

Plasma Blades were used by the cyberninjas previously as well and his whips were partially inspired by Scorpions rope dart. Cassie also shares things with her parents clearly. It doesnt make those weapons uninteresting or cool.You know why Kira and Kobra arent very memorable? They didnt get any development in their first and only appearance or after it. I dont count MKA as an appearance as every character was included by force and not because they had any real relevance to the main story. This is the same problem most D era characters had. They were introduced and then given nothing of note during or afterwords. They didnt get years of exposure like Kano. I dont get why people hate on this new generation so much when they havent even had a chance to do very much yet.

You cant even trust the processor speed because the speed largely depends on what processor you are using and whether you are using a laptop or a desktop.Im way too outside of the loop when it comes to comparing these specs these days.

Take a look at Injustice.  There were stages that pushed the limits of the PS so far that they became choppy.  The game also ran at  FPS this is double that.  Since theyre already still trying to do damage control on the PC version of their game and cant seem to get a real fix for online issues I can totally see how it is simply impossible to put a version out on  year old technology that they would be proud of.  Wouldnt you rather eventually play the game you had been waiting for for so long instead of some watered down version of it?And I really hope Im not overstepping my bounds here but if I felt the way youre saying you do about a franchise then money would have been no object.  Im not aware of your financial situation and I dont mean to sound insulting but its a little inconsistent to make it seem like the last  years of your life have been building to this moment and yet you arent willing to spend the money to experience it.  Is a PS expensive?  Yes.  But thats just reality and its not anybodys fault that things turned out the way they did.I dont know man.  While I feel for you I have a feeling that one day youll eventually get on board with the current gen and youll have a much better time with the game than you would have if theyd put out an inferior product.,MortalKombat,culzul0,16,t5_2robf

5006573,0,t3_3ji70z,I suggest FerraTorr. Ruthless or Vicious is what you want. Ferra is one of the best projectiles in the game great damage and shell eat everyone elses fireballs for breakfast including sub clones. while movement is slow they have surprisingly fast normals.  frame standard d and without Ferra that becomes Lackeys  frame d best in the game. Ferra normals also have fantastic range. They also hit like a truck for no meter. With the new PnG cancels that damage potential just skyrocketed. I love playing them. My favourite thing about them is how much position control they have. f f  will knock them full screen if caught high enough i use this against teleporting characters to bait.  f is a hard knockdown which leaves most characters just outside their effective range but right inside b and f range. b is fantastic at breaking armour and can be cancelled into bowl girl for a low or Ferra toss or b for an overhead. ,MortalKombat,cuphb9o,2,t5_2robf

But judging by all the tools each variation has they all could be good depending on the match up.What makes aftershock really good imo is that Tremor essentially gets an air poke. His normals pokes d d and d arent terrible but the air dd really helps out when he cant get out of certain pressure. It also creates a mixup threat any time he jumps at you since his air normals can be cancelled into it.,MortalKombat,cuq6mvt,2,t5_2robf

Its a little bit different too because Kitana has the annoyingly long combo thing but she doesnt have nearly as many mixup o easy starters  and Jason is annoying because or how easy he is both heil  and scorpion online make me feel like I playing against someone with training wheels on.

But then he picks jax and that  string is so safe and didnt look like it and it got me so often. Plus his super man punch on wake ups.

6212068,0,t1_cyvorpa,It could also be something like this KP not getting released on PC because of the absolutely horrible launch MKX had on PC. It could be that NRS is still overlooking the absolutely horrible reviews MKX have on Steam because lets face it it got a mixed status and a lot of the reviews there are Not Recommended that havent been updated since the Tremor patch when the game actually got playable properly both Singleplayer and Online.But even if thats the case its a stupid move by NRS to skip KP for PC since the first one was released with the other consoles.I just hope that they dont do a complete  and just say no PC to us that would be heartbreaking for real since this game is one of the best fighting games i have played it got the deepest mechanics and is the one that imo feels the best to actually get a long hit combo in. Plus even if it have sold bad on PC lets just say it the numbers are complete shit its still a bad thing to not drop it on the PC aswell since they can still get money from it. Theres still money to be made on PC and i think that more and more people are going to look at the PC port instead of the console versions because its easier and whatnot to play on. Well see.

6339496,0,t1_cz9w106,Im in a similar situation. I played old MK dont know which when i was a kid  happpily mashing buttons and having fun. Then i didnt touch mk at all like the game did not exist. I was busy playing half life tf blizzard games mmos.  And after looong time at the TI Dota  tournament there was the hub stream on which dota personalities just chilled and they had MKX. I fell in love with the game the moment i saw it. Later i learned that PC had terrible launch so i searched and searched if its ok to buy the game.   Turns out at that time it was fixed already except for online but i was ok with buying the game for single and hotseat only. I bought it and preordered KP. Was enjoying every moment of learning the game and actually becoming decent after  hours of beating ai being able to do  combos on characters i like.  I love that the game is easy to learn but hard to master that inputs are not super stupid and demanding so i can play casually and still be able to do stuff thats not basic punches and kicks.  Then they released Tremor and i was the happiest man in the world. Best character EVER. Instantly became my main and ive been playing him almost exclusively since then.  Needles to say im super dissapointed by whats happening. I got into MK with this title and i think that this game has the best setting from all fighting games. I dont really like tekken or street fighter and i have read that they are harder. MK has that something that attracts me.    Now i simply dont know. Will i buy next MK title? No idea. I dont know anymore.,MortalKombat,cza8asv,2,t5_2robf

6450586,0,t1_czm92gm,Exactly.  Making B start high makes perfect sense.  Its like Errons  that starts high but is still useful.  I doubt B will stop being useful it can just be poked out of on a read.  Either that or it needs to be started early on oki pressure and this reduces the armor breaking aspect unless you read they are going to armor and start your B at the right time.  Personally I think they need to get rid of her superfast  wakeups as well.  Its pretty stupid to be at a complete disadvantage when the opposing Tanyas on the ground.  Like reduce the damage on the now overhead make it hit mid and then make it safe or something.  That way it removes her  on wakeup while still keeping the move considering its necessary for one of her brutalities.,MortalKombat,czmj57x,2,t5_2robf

6498711,0,t3_44m67s,Well better pokes for starters.He gets a new d in slasher but its so slow its useless. Instead of a low sweep he needs a low quick stab instead of d.Safe buttons and pressure. The second you commit to b youre unsafe. Bf is unsafe unless you EX it. Choke is unsafe. F and F are too slow and unsafebarely safe. Speeding those up to acceptable speeds and making them safer would be a good start. Bf. Normal is a good way to close the distance but its a high and you van be grabbed out of it. Which is ok I guess. But the same applies to ex bf. Make it a mid have people respect it more same for ex db. Making ex db a restand to extend combos would be amazing.

Even if theres a lot of balance changes overall you at the very least can work on regaining and improving your mechanics and fundamentals. For instance even if your tools change overall the neutral game remains essentially the same and you really only improve at that if you actively work at it. Itll be a lot harder to work on your fundamentals and mechanics when theres a whole lot of new stuff coming at you so Id recommend brushing up on those first really. ,MortalKombat,d02yj6n,2,t5_2robf

I think that would be Raiden Fujin or even Shinnoks gig but what I suppose youre trying to say is Mary Sue which is an utterly rediculos notion to apply to anyone who has ever existed in the MK universe.Sadly its true that there was little in the way of character growth for ANYONE in MKX Im not sure I agree that Johnny did much himself. On the other hand she seemed to have started the game as a fairly mature if sassy down to earth lady whose main issue was fulfilling her role as the squad leader effectively. Between the MKX comic and MKX yeah Id say there was some considerable character growth for a number of characters including Johnny Cassie Kotal and more but there is nothing that qualifies Kotal Kahn to have been the canonical victor over Shinnok that doesnt also apply to Cassie or any of the new characters or even the old characters really.And whats this about yoyoing? She lost fights. Everyone in the story mode did. Sometimes theyd lose to people they beat earlier in the story. Thats not inconceivable in fictional or real universes.

Whiff punishing DF is even harder because of how quickly it recovers AND the threat of the rocket at the end which can be reflected and then combod into BF. Cyber Kano does a bit better but Jacquis DF is more plus on hit than Kanos knives so as soon as you trade projectiles your at a disadvantage. ,MortalKombat,d26o24i,2,t5_2robf

7356740,0,t3_4g26km,Ill add my  cents because Im an above average player who gets caught by low pokes to grab often....Its a totally legit way to play but to me it shows the opponent is more into winning than learning. Which is cool I mean not everyone really cares about frame data and what not but the truth is there are so many better techniques. Low pokes are there to open up your opponent into full combos. if your opponent blocks a low poke you are at a minus. Never low poke after a block. One is enough....Its far better to learn what string to start after a SUCCESSFUL poke. A grab is   hit that ends in hard knockdown. For example Raidens famous B is  which can be stringed into a corner carry or in the corner a  meterless combo. Ive learned its always better to take a loss and learn how to open an opponent up than use it. So cheap? No its unexpected because top players dont use this over and over and a good player picks up on that technique fast and punishes. To each their own though. Its more fun to learn than win for me personally ,MortalKombat,d2eet2i,2,t5_2robf

7800690,0,t3_4m3xg4,I dont think rifle swing should be a blockstring because this would be a useless buff  using riflestring on block is never a good idea ppl should hitconfirm fb instead of going to rifle swing on autopilot because its supposed to be a combo extender and nothing else.  A f mid or overhead should never be allowed srs id be okay with f being f because it leads to nothing anyway but again useless buff.  For me a good buff would be increasing d hit advantage to guarantee a  or . Thats all. After exsand Erronblack still can run into d and beat every normal so giving it better adv would help his pressure and mindgames considering how his armor isnt that good to escape pressure d with better adv would help alot. d has massive advantage but its slower. ,MortalKombat,d3suwuh,0,t5_2robf

7883142,0,t3_4n9vry,Travelling back in time slightly my boy Ed Boon calls me up for a fatality for Stryker.    I PRESENT POLICE BRUTALITY  Mid range    Stryker begins with taking his pistol and shooting one of his opponents knees forcing him to land on the other.   Equipping his baton he steps up and swings horizontally to shatter the other knee causing his opponent to scream out and drop to the ground.  The camera switches to Strykers point of view and you can see his harsh breaths as the camera shakes he takes his baton up in his hands and begins savagely beating the shit out of his opponents face the player can see bruising blood and shattered bones begin to form before one swing causes blood to spurt out and cover half of the camera.    A hand reaches up and wipes the camera clean and now Stryker goes hard savagely striking the head again and again until the skull itself breaks spilling brain matter everywhere. The camera is shaking heavily from Strykers breathing for a short while. Until you hear Stryker... wins!    Maybe a bit walloftextish but I like Stryker.,MortalKombat,d424zg2,3,t5_2robf

8182679,0,t1_d50d9k5,I feel NRS has done an amazing job with every character in the game. As a huge MK fan this opinion is almost entirely subjective and biased. For example JBriggs has a zoning FA midrange SG and closerange HT variation. Shes a textbook example of why the variation system is such a great addition. I can fight every single character in the game by carefully picking my variation. For example against any Kotal I pick FA to keep him away against Quan Chi I can pick FA or HT to render him helpless on knockdown and against Mileenas I pick SG so that once I hit her once she has to make guesses extremely fast as SG is a legitimate  machine that can melt a characters life bar real fast add that to the  damage it does anywhere onscreen into resets. Since I play all her variations I have little need to switch to different characters. I can just pick a different variation...,MortalKombat,d50dvau,2,t5_2robf

If she resets you into neutral that just means that you get a huge chance to fight back which completely defeats the purpose of a reset. Bro she cant even get a guaranteed d after because of stamina nerfs and Jacqui buttons are complete garbage. Even a grab is not guaranteed... The second standing reset without bar is essentially a knock down except your opponent is standing up... It isnt plus because of how far she puts you even if you do it as close as possible your opponent can d or even antiair a jump in. Trust me Ive tried both in the lab and online. There are NO situations where the second reset is actually advantageous to Jacqui. Im going off so Im just gonna stop. As you can tell I respectfully disagree.,MortalKombat,dars1lk,1,t5_2robf

Also Whenever Reptile refers to himself as the last Zaterren he never brings up Khameleon who is a confirmed member of his race and Chameleon who isnt confirmed but sure could be As far as I know the Zaterrans are a matriarchal society. The matriarchs have the powers to change form while males are restricted to basic invisibility. I figure Chameleon has the same powers because matriarchs can give males their abilities or Chameleon is some sort of abomination and considered not a true Zaterran.What if Reptile resents Khameleon because A.
