3891857,0,t3_34l1ib,To mjayg My English is so very bad. Sorry. For the timeline battle choose your  core team members for team   and . Select the assist tab where you will be shown your characters that you can select for the assist feature up to  heroes. You cannot select those that are grayed out as they are already in your core team. Select someone to fight then tap the auto icon. The fight will play out by itself use normal attacks and skills once they are available. Switching out your core team members and using assist heroes at key times can make differences in the fight. I wish to elaborate on this statement Switching and assisting at key times can help against tougher opponents Tip . Using an example team of  rank  heroes Captain Marvel Spiderman and Venom around the same level Captain Marvel in leadership position mastery with opponent team of Captain America Iron Man Black Widow Iron Man in leadership position mastery Example  starting the fight Captain Marvel is going against Iron Man after using skills quickly switch to Spiderman as speed hero has advantage over blast hero. Example  Once hit by Black Widows lighting skill that causes additional shock damage for  seconds switch to a different hero. The hero wont recover health but will not suffer the additional shock damage for the  seconds. Example When you defeat an opponent the new opponent will appear after  to  seconds. If your attack skills had cooled down by then you get a free attack. If not then use assist hero to get an unavoidable attack.  Example  When melee heroes close combat type with no ranged skills finish using skills they will get close to your hero to use normal attacks. Use assist heroes to make unavoidable attack when they get close.  Example  When the enemy team consist of ranged type hero time the countdown to when they use the beam attack skills. If you use the assist hero right you will get  or partial damage from their ranged attack skills while they got hit by the assist heroes.,FutureFight,cqzwm7h,1,t5_37irx

3915552,0,t1_cr2lmbt,Yeah thats my largest complaint about this game. Two abilities just dont feel like enough and theres always three more staring you in the face but theyd take months to unlock.

3969008,0,t1_cr8p1au,You cant really rely on Hero chests or dailies for Biometrics or character unlocks. The math doesnt really support it unless youre playing this game more than  years logging in daily for rewards. Kind doubt anyone plays a mobile game for that long outside of Candy Crush maybe...Im more of a realist and if you really want the most out of this game brief distraction for a few months then you need to evaluate the value of daily logins versus daily logins with quick farming Biometrics.I started this game around Wednesday of last week and I havent had the best of luck with Biometrics with my starters. Im  away from a Star Black Widow  away with a Star Iron Man and  away from a Star Captain America. But Ive had decent luck unlocking a handful of characters through basic farming and Starks Stash. Many of them are Lv.ish just from piggy backing EXP.So if I were you just do the math and create a login schedule. Prioritize how you spend your tickets coinciding important Biometric characters and which characters you want to Master their Leadership. Chances are the materials you need for them will overlap other characters.,FutureFight,cr8p897,2,t5_37irx

4044216,0,t3_36tw10,MockingbirdLast one for me unless a Black Cat is in my future which doesnt appear so p.Anyways this is a character I wasnt familiar with in the Marvel universe before Future Fight. I knew of her but not about her or what to expect.On that note I find her to easily be one of the tankier speed characters. Shes always seemed to have the most defense and HP of the Shield Divas so shes not totally squishy unlike the majority of the speedsters. Ill say her biggest strength is her ridiculous skill cooldown. By level  I had her attack skills on a  second cooldown which Im sure can go down even further maybe to  or even ?The important thing to note about that is against bosses and in arena I find her to be extremely viable at interrupting your opponent and stun locking to an extent if timed right. Her Bo Staff Kick is good for getting into fray which I usually give it  seconds and follow up with a Twin Stave attack. Whats cool about it is Twin Stave attack hits  times interrupting and keeping them locked all  hits and its about a  second animation. Thats  seconds your Bo Staff Kick is refreshing. Also your timer for Twin Stave attack starts as you hit the button so thats also refreshing during the animation. You can usually lock people up with her skill animations and ridiculous cooldown. Her rd skill Concentration amplifies attack speed and movement speed for  seconds and only has  seconds of downtime between wearing off and cooldown. It helps for furthering that exact goal of locking people up.For gear and ISO shes another I think would excel from Spy Tactics. A bonus to her already ridiculous cooldown is hard to argue against. You may be able to get her cool downs to  seconds with end game gear and the ability active and especially if you had  leadership mastery on Sharon Carter. Youd llikely be refreshing faster than you could use skills.Another route and one I find more interesting though is Binary Power. Im not sure if its my luck or her gear but my random gear stats always seem to be HP or defense increase. If it is her gear Binary Power would give her a larger HP pool more defense and a shield based off her HP. It would also give her a small constant skill cooldown as well. She definitely serves as my tankier character of Shield Divas.Overall I think shes a solid character. If you take the time to learn the timing of her skills and opponents she can be a huge asset that rarely lets her opponent get a hit. Shes not as squishy as other speed characters which is a plus in a category that suffers from being fragile. Shes very useful in Arena and Villain Siege but not super useful for mobs. Shes a single target character which leads me to her weaknesses. Shes got very little AoE. She can be frustrating if the boss in a mission is calling in reinforcements because she doesnt have many options to keep hitting the boss and take out reinforcements at the same time forcing you to choose what your target is. Shes still not as sturdy as a lot of combat characters however she can still hold her own and Ive taken down several combat characters despite their combat over speed bonus head to head in arena just because I can keep interrupting them. Thats her key though. You have to play her more to her strengths than I find for a lot of other characters but she can pay off well if you do.,FutureFight,crh9ryi,3,t5_37irx
4044932,0,t3_36uv1c,This game is fantastic.

It really is fun.The one thing I wish it had was since this is basically the mobile version of Marvel Superheroes  is the ability to login to your account in that game and get some cross platform rewards and such.

4221136,0,t1_cs1dxlx,His attacks are ranged. Its two quick shots followed by two slow shots. It feels lacking but I only had enough exp chips to get him to  and his gear up to lvl . Didnt upgrade skills at all. But his attacks dont seem to do too much even against creeps his level. Hoping hell get better soon though. So far his first ability throws the grenade thingy he used to get the stone out of the bluefloatybeam. It draws people in a bit and blows up. Pretty decent.  His second ability uses that big gun contraption that rocket made in the movie. It hits whatever you aim at and does an AoE explosion. Not bad. He probably wont make a good leader it only effects energy attackbased blast characters unless he was paired up with IronmanVision those kind of guys.

4290099,0,t1_cs97nt0,Yes but if you look at the Skill descriptions you will see even the ones that do Physical damage still calculate that damage solely from the Energy Attack stat. For instance Tip the Scales says Energy Attack  Physical Damage. What that means is the skill does Physical DAMAGE but the damage is calculated from  of Ronans Energy ATTACK stat. All of his skills calculate their damage solely from his Energy Attack stat no matter what type of damage they do. It is the same way for every character in the current roster even when they have skills that do both Physical and Energy damage that damage is always calculated from only one Attack stat.,FutureFight,cs97rzf,5,t5_37irx

4365092,0,t1_cshhoef,As someone else mentioned before its all about the time factor.    Some people might not be able to have their game running autoplay  and they need to burn energy quickly so its not sitting at cap and making them lose out on potential energy regen so they use clear tickets to do  quick elite missions and burn  energy for example.    Other times you might be one mission away from gaining a SHIELD level but you have say  energy left still. If you level up you get a full energy refill and you lose out on the  energy you had before. Clear tickets allow you to burn that energy until you have enough left to do a single mission and then level up to gain the maximum use out of your energy.    Yes both cases mean you dont get SHIELD or character xp but you still get everything else from running those missions.,FutureFight,cshoip0,1,t5_37irx

They couldve added special effects to your skills or made the gears themselves a bit more interesting than colored bars and circles. Examples would be some artifacts from the Marvel universe itself Spidermans web shooter adds a minor slow to your skills  or an Yggdrasil leaf that reduces your skill cooldowns by one second off the top of my head.,FutureFight,csrza77,3,t5_37irx

As an added comment about ALL Stat vs  by Lv statUsually All Stat is better for everything compared to  by Lv except for first slot. by Lv would be better than ALL Def or Atk for the First Slot depending on characters. For Example Iron Man requires Phys Defence mainly and although a  All Defense is great on First Slot a Physical Defense . by Lv will give  for Physical Defense at Lv  which may be slightly better than the jack of all trades option. At Lv  it will give .Just to be super clear  by Lv means  from your characters level. So . of Physical Defence by Lv Means . of the Level of your Character which will then be added into Physical Defense as shown by my example.,FutureFight,cssno1n,1,t5_37irx

Pretty much any hero whos been sufficiently leveled can excel in NormalElite and Arena is pretty unbalanced right now. Youve also put a great Spec gear on him which boosts most if not all of his attacks which most other characters dont have right now.  For example if there were  Energy or Physical attack boosting Spec gears Rider wouldnt hold a candle to any hero. And the gearing still doesnt fix his painfully slow base attack speed and movement speed.

This temporary boost lasts for  seconds that has a  second cool down meaning when it activates for  second it Ill not activate again. With Falcon its possible you could get a larger stat boost but it wont be active  of the time. As for which is better that is a tough call.

4669844,0,t3_3ewkt8,Honestly I feel like this is one of the most fair fp mobile games you will find. When it first launched it was fairly difficult to unlock and level heroes without paying. Since the launch just a few months ago they have added flash sales daily crystals for achievements better packages ally and enemy shifter bios villain siege bios farmable special missions and reduced elite missions from  to  energy. Netmarble is constantly improving the experience for all of their players. The addition of extra rewards for VIPs does not change this. The new mode will not cost energy or gold to enter. Its free stuff for every player. This is not a primarily PvP game. Other players unlocking more does not hurt you or your experience with the game. Would you like more free stuff? Sure who wouldnt want more for nothing! But they have to do something to reward those who financially support the game too.Basically Netmarble is throwing a party and passing out free slices of cake to everyone. They offer to give you a larger slice if you want to pay extra for it and you decline. If the the guy next to you in line takes that deal and wants to pay more for a bigger slice of the cake that shouldnt make your free slice taste any less good. ,FutureFight,ctj6pza,28,t5_37irx

I did buy the Antman and Giantman packages as well as the Team Pym package for the bios for my characters. So spending the crystals for the bios was a means to progressing a lot in the game. Now the argument can be made that crystals are best spent on uniforms because they are not purchasable any other way but purchasing bios is a good way to spend crystals too.

And to be honest I never lost.  Vision was the deepest it went in the line up.  Groot never died in  matches they just couldnt kill him.  GM just destroyed opponents and died only like  of the time.

5086656,0,t1_cuybfpo,Basically closing the game from your task manager or similar. It loses your progress for that level but refunds the energy expended and is particular useful in special stages to ensure that you get an ally shifter. The downside with Dimension Rifts is that the energy cost goes up  each attempt no matter if you force close or not. My thinking is that Id rather pay  energy for the certainty of having a particular piece rather than completing the stage and hoping the piece dropped. After seeing the drop percentages my strategy changed to farming lowest level and fusing those.  ,FutureFight,cuz4vac,2,t5_37irx

Didnt get ally shifters most of the time since I didnt even bother trying new stages until after I finished farming so it wasnt easy.

5092768,0,t1_cuv5yqz,Youre an idiot. Gamora is far from being a top speed character. BW Goblin Yondu Spiderman and possibly Antman are all better than her. All those characters at  star can easily destroy Gamora when v. She has to be in perfect positioning to fully execute her combo. She is terrible with AI due to being pinned against wall too often and her rd skill makes her vulnerable to attacks the target escapes. Other speed characters can dish out similar damage while being safer and have better survivability.  We can see that you love Gamora to death but she isnt that good. I dont know much about captain falcon but I can assure you that at  star Antman eats Gamora for breakfast. Gamora is sitting at the lower tier for speed characters right now probably in the same place as Sharon carter and Elecktra.  ,FutureFight,cuzvboc,0,t5_37irx

That said it occurs to me that with the absolutely massive dodge rate which Spidey can get gt with a dodge ISO set proc it might well be the case that spending your slot to effectively halve his dodge chance works out better than getting a  dodge yourself.

Would you stop playing the game or play the game any differently if the drop rate was constantly  versus ?The problem with the scenario you paint is that Netmarble has very little to gain versus how much they can lose. If they got caught for doing that its such scummy dishonest behavior I guarantee they will lose a HUGE percentage of their player base. Whereas if they just set the drop rate consistent at  basically nothing would change.But the bigger evidence against the point you suggest is that people HAVE broken into the code. How did you even know the drop rate for bios was ? How do people know Special Mission  drops at a  rate versus Special Mission  dropping at a  rate? How did people figure out the exact drop rate for every single comic cover piece hereSo if they patched the drop rate wouldnt someone be able to discern that they changed the drop rate?,FutureFight,cv2bwrx,3,t5_37irx

5345611,0,t3_3o6pjw,For me I consider Elektra midtier and that only recently with the addition of the bleed on her skill. She suffers from too many negatives for me to consider her any higher. With that said I fully admit my opinion may be biased by my own dislike of how she plays. . Her Native Gear Options are pretty bad. No dodge and no HP so she is a lot squishier than most other characters especially the top tier ones. . Her combos are never quite  safe. There are too many pausesdelayed starts in her skills that allow largeenough gaps for enemies to slip out of hitstun. This is REALLY noticeable in higher VS stages where the bosses are hard for someone like even YJ to keep in hitstun. Elektra has no chance of doing it. . Both her leadership and her passive are subpar. With characters like Wasp out there you would NEVER use Elektra as a leader not that a bad leadership necessarily regulates a character to a lower tier... but it is yet another mark against her. Allinall she is too unsafe in her combos for how squishy she is. No native hp or dodge with a weak passive and leadership on top of breaks in her combos that allow targets to hit her back. Her guaranteed bleed is the only thing for me that keeps her in midtier.Now with that said there are people who love her. I dont see why but I am open to the idea that I might simply be wrong. So take my opinion with a grain of salt.,FutureFight,cvuyn28,17,t5_37irx

Personally the longer it takes for me to unlock rank up and master characters the longer I will be playing this game.As a free to play user I actually enjoy saving my crystals because it makes what I choose to spend them on much more satisfying.

I did some qualitative analysis for a different thread Ill post here what I found.If it is somebody rocking an elemental gear BW with lightning GG with poison etc etc then yes go with Def Pen. If it is somebody with a Crit Rate gear go Crit Damage on Gear .Disclaimer some of this stuff is a bit old so I will not promise it holds the same merits anymore.Using all of these I found that you can roll a maximum of  Crit Damage on Gear . Seeing as the chart doesnt incorporate the addition of level  lets guesstimateinfer the amount of points you need for each  of crit damage is .   crit damage for a total of  crit damage because the base is  like the chart does say. If you have a  Crit Rate gear I believe this is the best way to go in terms of pure DPS aka all Team Up is really aboutEdit From Levels   the change in points needed per  increase is only  . So I may have even overshot with my guesstimate of  at Level  which potentially means that my final numbers are a little bit lower than what they will actually come out toAnd thats not even factoring in all the glorious Crit Damage that comes native on a characters gears. I think IP gets like  Crit Damage on his level  gear  maybe  idk. So that makes his total Crit Damage boost . Then divide by  again and find it translates to  Crit Damage and you should be hitting right around  damage  of the time.Boom. Maths.Im not  sure this is accurate but I tried my best P,FutureFight,cwicrb0,3,t5_37irx

5585418,0,t3_3rltxu,First love the title.Second I think its fair but it is hella annoying. To me costumes are a very cool part of this game and you know what I HAVE NONE. And I dont know what to do about it! I dont like most of the heroes that have costumes and some that do I hate the costume.Like I LOVE the broken ultron costume but I have a MILLION ways to deal with combat heroes and would far prefer the one that boosts damage to blasters but that one is the most ugly!I love old school blade and spider MODOK but I dont want to play either hero! So for me making these costumes time limited makes me FAR more likely to buy them even though when they come out I am uninterested. The interest builds and then they will do something like buy any costume for  crystals and I will buy a ton of crap i dont want...Like Bullseye costume Angela costume BW costume CAP costume She Hulk I actually want this one and throot.,FutureFight,cwpf8fp,2,t5_37irx

5589762,0,t3_3rod14,I would prefer to see an ISO or comic cover style system where I can take all may low level special gears that serve absolutely no purpose to me right now like Mind generator and combine them into a random special gear. The quantity and quality of the gears would then determine the level of the randomly generated gear. They could even introduce a couple of Rare th gears that are only obtainable by combining say  rank  special gears. These rare ones could be more useful for characters that dont do specific damage like Lightning or Mind damage. Instead they would be like a flat  all Physical Damage or all energy damage causes target to burn for  base damage for  seconds stacking up to  times. This would keep higher ranked people farming Dimension Rifts for special gears to combine looking for one that is actually useful in that th slot. ,FutureFight,cwpynln,1,t5_37irx

If you play Venoms skills smart you can stay relatively safe while still building for attack.  As for me I built for attack. First gear is physicalall attack second is all defense third is HP fourth is crit damage and fifth is crit rate. Thats pretty standard for a offensive build. You could also swap the fourth and fifth or play around with defense pen on the fourth. His ISO set is Overdrive.,FutureFight,cxfms35,1,t5_37irx

6239534,0,t1_cyyuygq,Returning players get  days of gifts. First day is the  selectors that you got. Youll get another  selectors on your th day of login. You get a free  on your th day back. I dont know if you have to log in every day but I would play it safe and log in every day for the next  days.So in total you get  selectors and a free  hero. But a couple things to note the  selectors do NOT include AForce girls SheHulk Sister Grimm and Singularity. each  selectors WILL expire in  days from when you get them. So the  selectors you got today will expire in  days xx hours so look through this subs FAQsearch function to find out which character you want to invest in and do it quickly. If youre a forgetful person like me youll end up losing them because youll forget that theres an expiration date! you only get a free  if you use the  selector on a character that you currently do not have. Youll know which characters you dont have because theyre greyed out when you click on My Team. If you use the  selector on a character that you already own for example Captain America Falcon Iron Man or Black Widow then youll just get  biometrics of that character. Even if your Captain America isnt a  you will only get  bios instead of automatically ranking him up to  because you already have him.So my advice find out which character you want to invest in I recommend you choose a plow character and that you only invest in one character use the two  selectors on that character as soon as you get them and on your th day back and you get your  selector use the selector on the character.But its really important that when you use the  selectors twice on a character that you do not get them before you get your  selector. So lets say you choose Kingpin. Use the  selectors from today on him. You now have  Kingpin bios. You can unlock him. But dont. Remember if you unlock him when you get your  selector youll only get  bios instead of getting a  Kingpin. ,FutureFight,cyyv8td,3,t5_37irx

6305948,0,t1_cz69pmi,Ah gamerMav where was that post when I started? Timeline  If you do your Daily Achievement  days a week x timeline battles youll earn  crystals. If you do  battles a day for  days with a lowend roster youre looking at  crystals. Its not worth the effort every day if time is a factor but Id definitely play a couple of times a week. Similarly always do at least one fight in every Battleworld you can qualify for because youll get at least some bios. Silk  Loki powerlevelling This is a terrible idea in that it involves not playing but...If you log in every day for a week and do nothing else collect your free character  bios and your st week daily login bonuses. Any Bio selectors should be thrown at your character of choice but dont activate the character. Then stop playing for  weeks. Come back after the break and log in again every day for a week. This nets you a  hero selector at least  bio selectors in the returning week do you get Bio selectors in the first week?and some other goodies. You throw all of those at the nonAForce character of your choice along with any daily  weekly selectors earned and youll have a  star in no time. You can be hobbled a little bit if you accidentally pull the character from a Daily chest before youre ready to claim them with the  Star ticket but only slightly.

6492089,0,t3_44kdse,All damage derives from either Physical Attack or Energy Attack depends on the character. The only thing that All Attack does is increase both the Physical and Energy Attack stats. To hopefully make this make more sense to you tap on any characters skill to bring up the tooltip which will tell you all you need to know about that skill. For instance on Scepter Bolt youll see Energy Attack  Cold Damage which means that Scepter Bolt will deal cold based damage that is based on  of your total Energy Attack. The only way to directly increase the elemental damage of a character would be to equip the appropriate special gear to them. Get yourself a Generator Cold if you want to directly increase Lokis cold damage. Otherwise just worry about increasing that Energy Attack and your Loki will do more damage overall. This applies to all characters. Just worry about increasing the appropriate Attack stat and youll do fine. ,FutureFight,czqtwtk,2,t5_37irx

6560915,0,t3_45hl91,gt  We all attack the World Boss at the same time and even though we cant see each other for lag reasons were fighting the same boss with the same single HP bar. gtNow for the World Bosss health  you want these fights to last a good  minutes. So you just scale it up or down as necessary. I dont know what the right number is but say  billion HP total. It could be  billion or  trillion HP for all I know.Not to come off as dismissive but that might be a bit complex for a mobile game. Spending  minutes on a phone is something we do daily but limiting that to a game is a bit much at least for me.I was thinking that rather than that we should scale it down a bit since as you said this isnt Wartune. Maybe we can make it so that its  teams of  for a total of  different people with each team having its own leadership being applied to it. Also we could make it so that any participating characters are required to be at least level   stars with at least  stars mastery. And have the health scale accordingly. Worst case scenario all of the characters participating are operating at the bare minimum so the health of the world boss is at . million and the best case scenario the world boss health tops off at  million maybe more those are broad generalizations at best.After all of that maybe the world boss could manage to have  million HP   billion HP total that appears as a bar at the top of the World Boss menu with each match regardless of winning or losing deducting the amount of damage dealt in HP. For example if a team loses but dealt about  million damage out of the  million it would drop the bar from  million HP to however less that is too lazy to do the math. The cycle would continue for roughly the duration of the Timeline Battles before cycling the boss out. ,FutureFight,czxybp4,1,t5_37irx

Im still not sure... I did a bit of an experiment and it seems as though Defense Penetration has a much better chance of proccing than Crit Rate but it has a set percentage of damage increase. Not sure not  but I think thats what it does. And its shown by bigger numbers much much bigger numbers.gt    Please explain Defense Penetration. I mentioned earlier I dont know if you were watching. Im not  sure. From my tests Defense Penetration you boost the points for activation rate and you get a guaranteed amount of plus damage.gt    So Defense Penetration how best to describe it from my point of view... Ok this is my understanding If the number is bigger than usual its Defense Penetration. If the number has an exclamation mark its Critical Damage. If its big with an exclamation mark then I think its Defense Penetration and Critical... I actually dont know. I think thats kinda what it is... But if you look carefully theres two different types of big numbers you got the ones with the exclamation marks and ones without.

6728069,0,t1_d0eq7xp,gtOnce youve rolled a set for a character that set becomes part of the characters inventory. Youll not be able to roll it twice and you can go back later on to previously rolled sets.Interesting but no.  From the beginning it should have been that set bonuses had to be discovered and that gold was required to change out isos. If you equip the right isos you discover a set bonus. And if you want to swap your isos to a different set you might pay a crapload of gold but its better than costing crystals. And there has to be a point where there is just too much rng. And for me its getting very close. NM needs to start being a bit more intelligent on what is and what isnt rng dependent.

6930026,0,t3_4al5yl,Trying to take a somewhat neutral view on the situation comparing what was intended versus what we got I think the solution to the whole matter is fairly simple.The idea is that the top tier of players come in and defeat the boss because they are able to dish out . million damage after  defeats i.e.  players a  buff kicks in so the health effectively drops to . million and from there . . . . etc. every time theres another  defeats. So the top tier goes in first then the second top tier third top etc. until the fight becomes accessible to many.The problem is there clearly arent  players in the top tier. The bugged health has artificially inflated the number but at the moment it is probably around  at best. If the top tier doesnt exist then this cascades down and causes all sorts of problems later on.I think we can guess what the solution is then that  target kill count needs to come down. That doesnt need to be permanent just a temporary measure to get people interested in the game mode then dial it up slowly as more and more people become capable of taking part. NM have just overestimated ability and interest and it is going to cost them unless things are adjusted properly.The game mode itself is almost certainly not the issue it is the expectations on and interest of the player base and thats only going to get worse if we are stuck behind a brick wall. NM have no way of telling what the reaction is going to be they can only guess. Now it has gone live the figures are there and if they were being sensible theyd try to adjust the figures to sort things out. That provides a fair solution to all those wanting the challenge still get it but the game mode is at least accessible to those who are willing to put the effort in and crucially it encourages people to discuss tactics about the game mode because at the moment its clearly being kept quiet which is the opposite of what is needed.,FutureFight,d11udqp,2,t5_37irx

Im still fighting the A.I. half the time because of how poorly Netmarbles live features are handled.Mostly all Ive experienced is that Timeline now takes longer and I have even less of a choice in who I am matched with than before.... the only entertaining moment in my experience was my very first game.

6937258,0,t3_4amnrp,If its not greedy investors then its greedy whales  the way the game currently is more than a few people are willing to spend  or  or  a month on MFF to advance just a little faster and throw MFF some dough as thanks for making a very fun game but there are just too many incentives to spend far too much money and theres nothing to stop someone from spending thousands of dollars on this one game. This is how whales are created and once theyre created you start to orient your whole development philosophy around how they play the game.If less than  of the player base drops  of all money spent on the game it would be foolhardy to do anything they might not like. The VIP system left a very bad taste in my mouth from the moment I found out how much money you would have to spend to reach VIP . If all obtained crystals counted towards that counter I wouldnt have nearly the issue with it but as it is its a huge incentive for people to spend thousands of dollars on what is ultimately an itty bitty mobile game.If NM gives up on Future Fight it will be because catering to the whales steered them away from what  of the player base wanted to see. Even if some characters are OP you cant monetize your game in a way that encourages whales to exist. There should be caps on how much money you even can spend on the game such that even if a player drops a lot of money on the game early on they cannot continue to do so. Even  a month is just plain too much.If I could go back and change the monetization system all crystal or cash packages would be onepurchase only for the life of the account and only starkbio stash would be repeatable. There would be no sales of items directly for cash. VIP would have all crystals obtained apply to it but the soft cap on how many crystals players can ultimately buy in bulk would prevent anyone from just instantly getting to  by putting  on a credit card. This diversifies and spreads out the spending portfolio so that players are still encouraged to spend without feeling like those who do have a significant advantage or that they have to spend a lot to get significant benefit out of spending any money at all.,FutureFight,d12nz9j,1,t5_37irx

There is a updownvote system in place that does a decent job of curation across the majority of Reddit and I think you need to give a bit of its power back. There seems little need for such ham fisted moderation on such a relatively small subreddit.Next time should be easier as there will be fewer players wink wink and I think a more generalized approach would be best.

I have  SCD on my comic cards so Im able to use shield all the time on Loki and you really need that you also need the att bonus Ronan gave Shulk other options so focus on the following cards to get SCD as soon as possible Loki agent of asgard and Marvel zombies  get those cards as high as possible.ampnbspI feel like the strategy is to play very aggressive use the team play as fast as you can keep the shield on all the time use summons all the time doh after those  things the priority is scepter bolt first and then astral projection. As for arcane blast sure you have to be aggressive but there is no need to hug him.... PEOPLE DIE THAT WAY.ampnbspI learned that the first version you gonna want to kill in about  to  seconds the second in before the  minute mark and the last... well the last you wanna kill before the  minutes are up.ampnbspThis tactic wildly based on luck you are gonna get beat a lot of times and you will hardly have time left  seconds for me  seconds for an alliance mate and  for another you will need lots of heals from Loki and you will have to also be lucky with your summons hitting the target.

The only thing I would add is this and its mostly directed at NMLast I read which was admittedly lat year at some time MFF was at more than  million downloads worldwide. Lets say you have just half that in active players. Now look at WB mode. As of this post around  victories against Corvus. And some of those are going to be people with  victories anyone have more?. Who are you trying to please here?  or so people out of your MASSIVE user base? That seems silly. Youve done a great job listening to the community so hear this Tone down WB. At the very least make it about skill and not mindless grinding to get that  perfect isogearcard combo that gives you a chance at beating these bosses a couple times. I understand that these characters shouldnt be gimmes but they do jeed to be fun to work for. Honestly I dont mind if it takes a couple months to get them and max them out but by then there should be new content on the horizon for me to look forward to. In other words these characters arent going to be my lifes work. Theyre not a yacht or a sportscar or some other fabulous prize that I dedicate myself to. I dont think Im alone in saying a mobile game will never be so important to me that Im going to make it my full time job to get some nifty digital good.

Its abysmal for Multiplayer modes. Obelisks we cant eliminate as theyre gear but we can see gear.

7013001,0,t3_4bp324,I would be fine with just nerfing the tier  characters to be at the same power level as all other characters tier  would simply mean a more complicated way to get them.Even though I am already collecting them at a decent pace there is just no fun in getting OP characters when most of the players have zero to little chance on getting them at all.

Is that the new improvement?The two ways to look at this update were adding stuff for endgame players to do or cashing out shortterm by milking the whales dry. But this? This would take me a year. And they added nothing for the meantime. Almost as a statement. And its .. I dont get it there has to be something they arent telling us. Something new that goes with this because that up there will absolutely push people out. If someone ranks these theyll want to use them and the only place for that is Arena. With the rest of us.

This is the least fun WB fight maybe even the least fun element in the entire game to me. It is just no fun. Surely defeating her feels great but the countless tries up to there are just freaking annoying.Dont get me wrong I can defeat her. I have defeated her with  teams yesterday. But in doing so I need to try over and over again sometimes less sometimes more. The worst part about trying over again is just that it feels so completely random. After the first phase its either impossible to memorize her attack patterns or its useless.It is not fun to rely on luck so that not some stray bolt will hit and stun you leaving you completely powerless for excrutiating seconds that feel like a lifetime while you inpotently hammer on any buttons just to hope for any reaction. This is no fun because I see no learning curve. It is just hitting as hard as possible to finish as quickly as possible. No moving or dodging pattern helps. When I play a game I like to find the most efficient way to use a character. It is not the case here. I cant be efficient because I rely on luck alone. ,FutureFight,d1ggyvr,2,t5_37irx

7099510,0,t3_4cqzbv,You joined at a strange time.  of the most vocal base of the game right now is up in arms over the game adding more things they feel ruin the game. You can look it up after you get some bearing on the game to see whats the dilly yo.As for what to do you are going to get a lot of stuff thrown at you rank up tickets bios crystals and energy. Your first goal is to get a couple of  star characters. You can get one via all the check in rewards and completion rewards over your first  days. The best person to get is Loki the best person to get a uni for with your discount is LOKI. He is just too good in too many modes to pass up!Then go after whomever you love. Carnage will take some money to level and the T people are not going to be available to you to farm for a long time.One tip is to lose a story mission any one you will get a free  star person at lv ... They may have removed this but it doesnt hurt to try! Thats the gist of it just start grinding away at loki and  others you like and you will start to get more and more of the game as you progress.I would hold off on spending any money until you figure out how much you like the game. And then I would start with Stark stash or the bio subscription but there is a TON of things for you to do that you dont need to spend a dime on.Maybe this weekend I will try to make a vid for a new player.,FutureFight,d1l3mri,0,t5_37irx

Most of the chars that people use to get the  bonus can solo it within  seconds. So dont think of this is some sort of coop where everyone deserves equal credit. This is just a game mode where players can go through to get some additional resources and people naturally figure out the most efficient way to get the most out of it. Theres still no stealing the bonus. If you dont like it then you leave or switch to another char who can top the other guys. Its really that simple. Dont blame the players. Blame the system for making this the most efficient  method to get critical resources. However this system is already much much much better than the original that we had before. If you really care that much about the bonus then start your own team or leave if someone switches.

It was clearly never something that was intended for the character and the fact that it got changed now along with Deathlok makes it clear that those types of attacks in general werent processing the way they were intended to.

7428614,0,t3_4gzvey,PEOPLE!!...NON LOKI TEAMS lol jk...but seriously that hero ranking for world boss needs to remove Ronan and Loki from the system so we can actually see some real teams being used. Anyway Ive beat him  times so far. Won with my Sharon Loki YJ tandem will no problem for the most part. Other  teams I used took a few attempts but that was basically from me struggling with this crappy cursor movement on my phone.Team  Miss Marv Ironfist Daisy  Honestly he barely touched me whenever I used Marv. After his st super punch I switch to Daisy to trigger her buff then tag to Ironfist and wait for Thanos to pound into the ground. Run and give him a serious beating with Ironfist then tag back Marv and blast repeat the process all over again.I did that for the entire fight even during his final phase. Using DaisyIronfist tandem when he was most vulnerable which is when he pounds the ground and throws orbs.Team  Elsa Kingpin Antman  This team won on the nd attempt and fairly easy. I basically use Kingpin until Thanos begins to blast his lasers in the nd phase. Switch to Elsa use th skill and watch out for intense ground pounds. Antman actually deals pretty good dmg on him. I think Thanos defense is somewhat lower than the rest of the BO in wb. I used Antman for almost the entire rd phase just tanking away.I recommend letting those little cosmic orbs hit you instead wasting time avoiding them. The dmg they deal isnt game changing and it allows u to comfortably use your summonings and buffs afterwards..Edit I was able to beat him  times today. Not necessary but my th win came with Corvus whom I was able to rank up to  today. I led with Ronan but used Corvus the entire time. I didnt even run from Thanos just spammed his minions and th skill for the entire fight lol it was so beautiful.,FutureFight,d2ml3rh,4,t5_37irx

Those whales who were not able to beat World Boss many times now have  Proxima at least. pay to win is getting more prominent. Today I fought my all  battles against same guy who gave me  points and who doesnt have a BO character in his team. But I had to re roll many times to get such an opposition.

7693826,0,t3_4kof5m,As someone that does the best reward game more than I would like too its done because thats the way NM has structured the system.Best reward every  matches or possibly  matches to get BR.  Its simple math if you have the time.Because that is the massive drawback to playing the BR game.  A full roster that just plays with whoever and with no concern with best rewards will take around   . hours depending on matchups speed of team forming and which boss you get.The massive downside of the  BR game is that it takes around x longer to complete.  possibly longer.  So you can be upset all you want and complain about your time being wasted but the reality is you will finish long before they do.The other thing to take into account at least when I do it is that I privateopen with a  or star then upgrade to a .

7967930,0,t1_d4bldp1,Im not completely sold on whether or not BWs uniform is necessary.  Reasons  Her AoS uniform in terms of statwise is better  to .  Sure with the uniform you get a paralysis effect and an attack on  move.However what exactly is her usage in game and in those situations is her uniform worth it.  AB and WB  the effect is not needed at all.  As is the star move.  None of either is realistically usable.  Move isnt practical nor is it lightning based.  The buff is actually better for AB and WB modes.  In AB all that matters is movement and star move.  Not too dissimilar in WB but you will use a few more moves but movement is still key an that adds a ton.  Add that in neither of those modes will paralysis matter.  It might make a small difference in AB but if you are using star movewhich is also an iframe move now mobs flinch for a few seconds anyways and as thus it becomes a little extra but realistically unneeded.  Movement buff is still better since the speed you gain is more important.  You may still get it in the star move but the wayy she moves is problematic for running into mobs and can leave you open.  Best to pop the buff when youre clear and dont have a forced move.Where the uniform would be good however is in BWD and TimeLine.  Depending on the frequency of the proc it can be invaluable in those modes.   A spin attack is also very good against AI controlled opponents.  Thus it will have its effectiveness but know how you plan on using her.  And if you have no use for TimeLine or BWD then probably a good idea to skip this one if you have the AoS one.,FutureFight,d4bo5ug,1,t5_37irx
7972654,0,t3_4of3pb,I use Stark Backing for Loki...its not the IDEAL set...but its definitely useable.I LOVE any offensive set like HE on Silk...very goodIF again SB isnt awful...but I like a more offensive build with my IF,FutureFight,d4c79p1,1,t5_37irx
7972842,0,t1_d4bzdze,Interesting he was my rd  char to go with elsa and punisher but pretty sure in the menu at least it says energy attack I do know that some of his skills have a physical damage portion as evidenced by vision or hb shields but never tried switching to all attack not that Im particularly bothered he is very outdated now on my team since I have many more characters just found it interesting,FutureFight,d4c811z,1,t5_37irx

8015051,0,t3_4ozvvi,I would pick MK because he destroys combat AB as well as does WB as well as Hyperion. With the new obelisk mechanics you can conceivably keep rolling a recovery one until you get  recovery main stat Dodge or recovery second stat and a proc to increase his skill damage by  or more making him durable and destructive. ,FutureFight,d4gyswa,2,t5_37irx

8046370,0,t1_d4j6y8d,I have a  star generator on Thor with  lightning damage and the ISO set is Smart Racoon. Skills at . Gears at . First and second gear options are obvi. Third gear I went all HP. th gear I went all SCD. My alliance is terrible it is level . I left my last alliance to search for a higher level couldnt find one for a few days so have stuck with this one for weeks. I hear having a much higher level alliance makes a big difference in buffs.I will strongly consider switching my ISO set to DDE. Cards wise I have crap. I dont have CW  or CW  or the marvel zombies variant cover. I just have the regular cover marvel zombies that is  star and  a  star  loki a  star  punisher a  star but  in the blue hexagon Captain Marvel Carol Corps and a  star  SM .I am sure it is worth the crystals to buy some card packs to try to pull CW CW  and the variant zombie cover I am just not sure what the chances of getting any of those cards from packs is.I am definitely interested in your advice on cards and building Thor.I have a  Carnage Thor and Loki and a  Silk. I have a  Ronan  Blingpin  Spiderman and  Venom that I used to use with Carnage but my universals are so much better that Carnage Rebirth has been collecting dust. In the meantime I have been farming Ronan Kingin Deathlok Coulson and Lincoln most of them are  or  stars with no mastery.I had been putting everything into getting Thor Loki Silk and then Carnages skills and gears maxed farming debris instead of bios but am about to switch to farming a lot of weak Timeline characters because it generates so much gold and debris for me just to have a bunch of s.If you have any tips or advice at all Im all ears.,FutureFight,d4khkyw,1,t5_37irx
