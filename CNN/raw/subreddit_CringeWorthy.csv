7986944,0,t3_4om0om,When I see people getting tattoos like this it just makes me wonder more about the tattoo artist.  Why would a true artist do this?  They cant possibly want their name and reputation tied to this.  Im not talking about the actual picture just the placement. Didnt they try to talk this person out of it?  Just wondering.,CringeWorthy,d4dt48e,1,t5_2tjkf

My first job out of the industry was surreal bc sexual harassment is seemingly less tolerable at professional jobs.  I almost didnt know how to act professionally bc for so long I had to be a different person just to survive in that world.  I can be true to myself and have people respect me more so for my intelligence and hard work instead of my ass and tits. Dont get me wrong they still play their part. I mean Trump is Pres amiright?,CringeWorthy,dcmb2tp,1,t5_2tjkf
