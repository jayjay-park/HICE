704504,0,t3_221x81,From the muniI write to provide an update as to this situation.Yesterday the property owner was asked to cease all work pending investigation of the matter and immediately complied.Upon investigation the Municipality has determined that the tree work was carried out within the Municipal Right of Way and as no permit had been applied for the work was unauthorized.Today the property owner has been served with a letter requiring him to pay the  permit fee and has been fined  pursuant to Bowen Island Bylaw No.  .Should the property owner wish to undertake further tree work he has been advised that authorization will not be given until after the heron critical nesting period has ended May   and that a new permit fee and  damage deposit will be required.SincerelyKristen Watson amp Christine WalkerBowen Island Municipality,bowenisland,cgkcsh1,1,t5_306yn
