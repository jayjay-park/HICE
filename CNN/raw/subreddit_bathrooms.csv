5500689,0,t3_3qf8i2,The damage is from water ingress from the sounds of it Im afraid. While a tiled floor can take some water its not required for it to be waterproof. If a separate shower tray is installed its unlikely to have any additional water proofing its good practise but adds cost so is often avoided unless you ask for it. If the shower is a walk in tiled floor I would expect the area immediately around the area to be waterproof. Even with this you should not leave water standing in a bathroom.Some photos would help and if you are using a shower curtain rather than a shower door I would argue thats asking for trouble in a rented property. However you might well be found to have caused this damage with excessive water ingress which has caused the wooden base to expand and pop the adhesive and grout.Get us some photos and see if we can get a bit more info for you. Even the above is unusual within a year so you might still be correct that the installer has caused it.Good luck!,bathrooms,cwerjjh,2,t5_2qlpf
