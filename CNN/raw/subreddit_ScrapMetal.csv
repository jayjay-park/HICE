6334376,0,t3_42akal,I dont know the situation in Germany but I am going to guess its the same situation every where in the world. My family owns few scrap metal yards. I can tell you one thing for certain. Scrapping is not where it is at right now. Market is bad. Our profit margin went down. Its been really bad for past two years atleast. So if I were you I wouldnt even think about it. Now to your real question. Would scooter be good? Temporarily yes. Regular scrap Iron is almost down to the pennies. A whole junk car is going anywhere from . You decide. So dont worry about a washing machine. Get copper and Brass. Catalytic converters and carbide. Pretty much the high value. ,ScrapMetal,cz9ndil,1,t5_2sdsl
