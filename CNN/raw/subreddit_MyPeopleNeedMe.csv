I actually had a great time doing that with no issues of fear. What does bother me is what I assume is mostly due to a gross ignorance as to how currents near the shore work bc I am severely terrified of being dragged out by some sinister current and getting the shit beaten out of me by relentless waves. The occupants of the ocean are a pretty low terror tier in comparison to the fluctuations of the tide. Haha now I am thinking of all the times I even remotely thought the tide was coming in and had awful visions of being swept up and away never to be seen again.

On the day of liftoff Wan splendidly attired climbed into his rocket chair and forty seven servants lit the fuses and then hastily ran for cover. There was a huge explosion.
