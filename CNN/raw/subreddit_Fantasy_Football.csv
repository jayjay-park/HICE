4732019,0,t3_3fah10,DeMarco. Better offense wayyyy better offensive line Buffalo was one of the worst in the league last year Philadelphia  according to PFF will lead to more opportunities. I think concerns about DeMarco in a time share are over blown rest assured he will be the guy in that backfield. Im much more concerned about Ol Freddy Jackson stealing touches from Shady especially at the goal line. Not something I can say the same of for Murray. On top of that Shady just didnt seem like he wanted to run vertically last year... maybe that will change this year but he was dancing a lot in the backfield last year.,Fantasy_Football,ctr0h2a,2,t5_2qxqc

In the future try to figure out how much playing time a player will have.. more touches generally means more opportunity.

If youre playing in a regular  or  man league then there are always decent enough QBs DEFs and Ks on the wire. Its RBWRTE that are scarce and their risk of injury is much greater than it is for QBDEFK. Your bench should consist entirely of RBWRTE.Also even if youre lucky enough to have a healthy RBWRTE corp thats starting every week for you you should still be continually active on the waiver wire to stash your bench with the best players you can find.

I feel your pain as although I dont play in a league with a cheating commissioner our commissioner of three years has gotten the reputation as a whiner and crybaby whod very likey cheat at Monopoly with his own kids just to win. He is a big fan of encouraging other owners in the league to veto trades that he doesnt like and whatnot and as a result hes become the source of much controversy in the last year or so. The league nearly came to an abrupt end last year because of his antics and as a result most of the owners in this keague have decided to move on after this year and start a new league without our former commissioner. As far as Yahoo allowing commissioners to change lineups midgame that happened in our league a couple years back although it was sanctioned by the league owners as that particular owner had circumstances beyond his control that wouldbt allow him to alter his lineup before gametime. All that said cheating of this type should absolutelt NOT be tolerated on any level and as a result your commissioner should be relieved of his duties ASAP and he should be forced to sacrifice his team and his buy indues and either be kicked out of the league or suspended.

5520082,0,t3_3qpqyo,Honestly I would trade Murray while you can. He has both high upside and insanely high downside. Ryan Matthews has been outrunning him all year and its a matter of time before  Chip accepts that and either starts Matthews consistently or decides to lean on Murray until he produces.I honestly dont know which way he would go. To the outside world and most analysts theyd pick Matthews. though Murray is being paid much more.Chip seems to like Murray more too. If he decides to lean on Murray you likely just lost an RB.

5527220,0,t1_cwi2zt8,I disagree...  My leagues I have two of them have QBs at  points per TD and have for years while the other skill positions score at  points per TD.  Yet while having an elite QB is certainly nice it is no guarantee of success or winning.  While a QB like Brady or Manning going on one of their legendary seasonal tears will definitely tip the scales in your favor most weeks on the whole the positional values still even out nicely.  The one league Im in with QBs scoring TDs at  points is a complete joke!  Essentially in that league Kickers are more valuable than QBs which is absurd!  The QB is the prime position on a real football team and is should be represented as such on a fantasy team in my opinon.  And with positional prevalence of good QBs especially compared to a position like RB I think weve always struck a nice balance in my leagues.  Elite WRs and elite RBs still have more to do with teams winning titles than elite QBs do even in a league with higher points modifiers for TDs.,Fantasy_Football,cwi5gd0,-4,t5_2qxqc

You have  rookies on your roster in a year when the rookies are not expected to perform that much. Then you have  more players that are in year two only  of which who had a good rookie season.

Have an idea of how much time each player should get and urge them to hurry if its taking too longAllie draft pick trading also another reason not to have a time limit. If someone doesnt like anyone at that spot let them trade down! And watch people try to outbid one another when you announce you are looking to trade the pickHave some food and drinks. Food can be burgers and hotdogs or order pizzas. Anything works as long as everyone likes the idea. Have everyone pitch in money and split it. For drinks have a beer bitch. Makes this the person who got last place the year before. They are required to go get beer for everyone throughout the draft you can do specific rounds instead if you wantDont rush the process. Let everyone have a good time. Maybe have some bags set up or some thing like that to allow people to get their earlier and hang out or to stay after and hang out after the draft is done. Also to make it easy for you put each pick in the computer as the draft is going on. Saves you time after everything is said and done.

8584475,0,t1_d6emrfc,I would go DJ here. He in my opinion will end the year as the top PPR back. AP doesnt offer too much value in PPR and neither does Gurley anyway. DJ and Miller will fight it out for the top  PPR backs...but i give the slight edge to DJ in the Cards offense.

8683228,0,t3_4yx1q5,Demarco Murray better oline and system for him than last year. Jeremy Langford  Should see majority of touches. Fox likes to run the ball. Doesnt seem to trust rookies all that much so could see a good amount of carries. Lagarett Blount  Should see majority of goal line touches. Could have some high end games with Lewis out. A bit of a boom or bust. Matt Jones Alfred Morris is gone. Hes a bit banged up and that oline isnt great but if hes healthy he should see the majority of first and second down work. Justin Forsette  Bit of an RBBC right now. But if he shows any flash could gain the majority of the carries back. Rashad Jennings  Was caught in an RBBC with Coughlin there. He is injury prone but if healthy should see the bulk of the carries. Those are all guys I aim for if Im playing the  running back strategy. I like volume over talent. Ill take as much as  high end wideouts before turning to RBs depending on the format. Ill try to accumulate as many of these guys as possible and see what shakes out.

8768232,0,t1_d71mcg9,I was the same way man.  I did the same thing.  I love college football but could never get into nfl so I started ff as a way to try and get into it.  I still dont care anywhere near as much and dont really have a team though. As far as bench goes  I never keep a backup qb but a lot of people do and it may not be a terrible idea on a  man league  but I probably still wouldnt.  I also never keep an extra te unless I end up with like gronk and Olsen both somehow. So pretty much I would keep a decent split of back up wrrb and maybe keep  slot for a teqb if you want.  Also   thing I forgot to mention about defenses. Unless its a special case  like the Seahawks  years ago or the Chiefs  years ago  I change defenses very often and have no issue dropping my current defense for another one and then changing back the week after if theyre still available. Just play the match up. ,Fantasy_Football,d71oy9t,2,t5_2qxqc

9103065,0,t1_d860bjg,Personally as of right now it looks like Howard is going to get the majority of snaps in Chicago. I cant say much for Washington. Once both back fields get healthier itll probably turn into a committee. Thatll definitely be the case for Detroit considering theyre a very vertical team. Chicago has never really had a running back by committee but there is no true starter so they may try to see who works best where. I wouldnt call Langford a bust just yet. Give him some time to get  healthy and get the offense in rhythm and he could be a great dual threat back. Its just Chicagos offense is in shambles right now. Its really hard to watch as a Bears fan.Howard and Washington ride them while you can its probably not going to last too long getting  touches a game.,Fantasy_Football,d861j9t,1,t5_2qxqc

There are many more Brady is the epitome of making something out of nothing. He could be throwing to high school receivers and still go for  yards and a few touchdowns. Maybe not but you get the idea. The amount of Pro bowlers Brady has had in his receiving corp can be counted on one hand he simply does not NEED good receivers. If they run the route that belichick and Brady draw out he will deliver the ball and get it done.

Marvin will definitely have some more huge games but he will have to share with Tate. I dont think the offense has enough volume for two guys to go off simultaneously might be wrong there so its going to be hitormiss going forward... but even when he has a poor game  like last week the TD is the only thing that saved his performance  hes still getting targets so Id be reasonably comfortable moving forward with your group. ,Fantasy_Football,d8zcd69,2,t5_2qxqc

However as we saw this past weekend Osweiler is capable of getting things going on offense. If he can place  more of those targets on point Hopkins is super fantasy relevant. Additionally Murray has been phenomenal. The Titans have one on the best rushing offenses in the league. They have a super easy stretch and Mariota has found his groove. Hes going to continue being a great start. Yeah Julio is the wr in the league rn but hes had his fair share of duds.

Theyve been very inconsistent and those top  weeks they played defenses that are being started most every week with the exception of Baltimore in week . Defenses vs. Jax are     Colts in London Bye week  .

9422586,0,t1_d991ong,If Suhicide does drop OBJ to grab Brown you can just pick him up instead. Id say netting OBJ is better than Fitz anyways just for my reasoning above. And if Throw like Gurley has a higher waiver claim and drops Fitz to grab him you still net your initial trade anyway based on following week byes and points Fitz would be the only player I could see being dropped to grab OBJ. If somebody drops someone else you can just net an even higher scoring WR. As for spot starts Amari Cooper could be a good start opposite Crabtree I think that Bucs  Raiders game is going to turn into a shootout.

9463366,0,t3_5a7942,Ill be a little more specific hereWe have a rule in place that if a player changes position this happens a lot with TE they get changed in the league. Yes even post draft. So for example Bucky Hodges TE for Va Tech was listed as a WR on their depth chart thats what we use no Ourlads before the first game. This meant he gets moved in the league to WR. So if you drafted him as a TE youre out of luck. This was clearly spelled out before the draft and before everyone paid. He was very upset about this. The best part he didnt even own Bucky Hodges. This is to prevent gaining an unfair advantage by being able to start a WR at TE. Basically allowing you to start  WRs and no TE while everyone else has to start  WRs and  TE.Secondly Fantrax had an issue with waivers processing. All unowned players go on waivers when their game starts. They then process Monday evening at . The first issue was all players became FA but no waiver transactions processed and people starting picking up FAs. I noticed this locked the player pool and reversed all FA transactions. I contacted the website and they eventually fixed it and waivers processed as they were supposed to.This happened  more times I think and one week it almost got to the point where I was going to have to manually do this process for  owners. I was willing to do that. Fantrax came through in time and got it fixed.Each and every time waivers ended up processing as they should have. Nobody got screwed anywhere at any point. In the last rd of the season everything starting running smoothly again. He apparently hated me for this none of which was my fault demanded his money back claims hell do a charge back and is basically harassing the league.One owner suggested I refund him just to get rid of him. That wont happen as everyone was asked to read the rules several times before and after payment and definitely before the season and draft began. I dont know exactly what his problem is as those are the only  reasons I can think of but hes definitely a headache and I would steer very clear of him. I think its important to note that he was out of playoff contention very early in the season.,Fantasy_Football,d9fjqvb,1,t5_2qxqc

9935369,0,t1_db2lhy2,In my league Rivers had  points to Bens . I dont think my league deducts for safeties but we do get . for sacks. Rivers had  TDs to Bens . Rivers had  more turnovers than Ben.,Fantasy_Football,db2lr60,1,t5_2qxqc
9944389,0,t3_5hwrfe,Im up by  funky scoring in this league ?but translates to about  standard pointsand my opponent has Brady Edelman and Gostkowski.  Im not comfortable at all.,Fantasy_Football,db3s16s,8,t5_2qxqc

9963012,0,t3_5i42fr,Id still go Hyde you no Hyde is going to get points its guaranteed and probably double digits. Hes a beast and honestly the only good thing for the niners right now. Look at the bears and Howard same situation with him I have Howard and he produces every week and honestly hes a solid RB  in my opinion this week Hyde is a RB. ,Fantasy_Football,db67g0c,2,t5_2qxqc
9966110,0,t3_5i6lq2,RW Diggs if healthy Rawls....i would have said Graham but if you want to diversify then go with Eifert who has been red hot. Help with my WDIS if you would thx!,Fantasy_Football,db6lz9k,1,t5_2qxqc

9968823,0,t3_5iaeas,I did this with defenses last year. I had already stashed my week  defense but saw he only had one on roster with a bad matchup that week. I dropped several players including my week  defense Arizona who was playing Green Bay week . My opponent was also the commish and was super pissed vowing to change the rules next year to only allow max  defenses per roster. He ended up picking up Arizona and they scored  points for him. I still won. ,Fantasy_Football,db6ypts,1,t5_2qxqc

10065850,0,t1_dbj4t5x,I know.  I just dont trust my other WRs as much and Im terrified of the whole...start Jordy and watch Devonte go off on my bench thing.  I started Jordy and Tyreek hill last week but I just dont trust him this week in denver.  Brandon Marshall is dead to me and Tyrrell Williams hasnt been consistent.    So Im going balls to the wall I guess.  Hope one of them goes off and the other gives me a solid yardagereception day.,Fantasy_Football,dbjlqg9,1,t5_2qxqc
