7852070,0,t1_d3ymal5,Depends.  Was there something specific that contributed to your low grades besides laziness?  If so then  be proactive.  If it was you were just slacking I would still say its better to be proactive but can understand your hesitation.  But I have very good sources that tell me that if you have something besides laziness going on write an email to admissionsmu.edu.,Marquette,d3yn5f9,1,t5_2s1ga
11219763,0,t3_602bvb,Everything I complained about this year is what happened in the game. . Terrible ball handling. Dumb fouls. Dependence on  pointers . Rebounds  and  I can see getting better but Wojo has to make the decision to get this team to start playing physical basketball not these hard to make shots. You cannot win games unless you make drives for the hoop. I think that will get easier with the new freshman next year who is like  feet tall basically replacing Luke. Wish I could still be here next year but sadly graduation slowly apporaches. ,Marquette,df3qvet,5,t5_2s1ga
