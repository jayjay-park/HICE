1020159,0,t3_25nzup,Touchups on an exterior finish are pretty much a recipe for disaster anyway without serious sanding masking and spraying.  The beauty of acrylics especially Model Master and Vallejo you can wipe it off with a wet qtip if you move fast!  Tamiya paint dries too fast and bonds too quickly for that both otherwise excellent qualities in paint.  I wouldnt necessarily lock yourself into just one type.  I do detail work and interiorengine colors with acrylic when possible enamels sprayed when I need strong bonding like surfaces to be masked and lacquer for high glosses and clears. And a mask.  And a fan.  And a filter.  and a healthy dose of ibuprofen if Im spraying for a while.  ,ModelCars,chk8z87,1,t5_2se1w

2289049,0,t1_clumdja,Youll find that Tamiya is the goto brand for almost anything that you could want.   For cars most of the Japanese brands will be pretty dependable  Fujimi Aoshima etc.   For armor I like the amount of detail on Dragon kits.   ,ModelCars,clun5ep,1,t5_2se1w

2896830,0,t1_cnx29jl,If the silver and white dont work too well just go over the part a few times with it  I cant remember the brand of mine bought it years ago but I bought it on its own from those big individual pen and pencil shelved at a news agency.  For the trim on models I use BMF Bare Metal Foil. Its really thin silver foil with an adhesive backing. what you do is cut a bit off the sheet and slap it on the trim form it around the trim with a toothpick or qtip then cut off the excess. For black trim like on Japanese cars I mask around it with masking tape and paint it flat or satin black ,ModelCars,cnxdhd4,1,t5_2se1w

7891034,0,t1_d430ghe,Awesome! You can usually find them pretty cheap on Ebay too. I got this one and  others for about . because they were all chipped and scratched. But I used them to practice paint techniques for my  scale plastic kits. When evaluating a HW or MB car I usually look for rolls straight looks like crap because wheels are hard to find sometimes. Replacement aftermarket decals and parts can sometimes be found on Ebay as well. Lucky you already have a source though! Best of luck and have fun! ,ModelCars,d430xey,2,t5_2se1w
8032955,0,t1_d4itpcz,Hey thanks for the info and luck!Ive already done a fair bit of research into model painting and general model stuff so Ive seen a few tutorials by now. Im also already familiar with painting and spraying with cans but in an industrial context not modeling.All I was confused about is when to choose a spray can vs when to choose a brush but I think your comment helped a bit. I ended up essentially buying bottles of paint in the colours I want to brush details with and buying spray cans for colours I want larger piecesbody painted with. So thanks again!,ModelCars,d4izais,5,t5_2se1w

10032603,0,t1_dbduvgg,The floor polish has to set and cure for about H before you handle it or its going to have fingerprints in the finish.But all the paints the primer the base coats and the clear coats need to be sanded level and smooth before laying down the floorpolish as a finish. Get yourself some abrasive pads or cloths in    and  grits and just work it over really nicely with each grade. Itll shine before you even get the polish coat on.I usually dilute the floor polish so it doesnt get gloppy when you hit the model with it. I use Pledge floor polish which is acrylicbased so regular Testors acrylic thinner will work just fine. The results will be sooo glassy youll impress yourself.,ModelCars,dbf9wjd,2,t5_2se1w
