338236,0,t1_cffmojm,Alright the health bug youre experiencing has to do with armor that gives you increased health. When youre wearing armor and you level up the game somehow forgets that you had that health increase by the armor. To fix it just open your inventory and your health is back.About entering the Volcano town once you get get District  the exit door will always be that purple door that you saw. Its the final boss zone.Either you killed the boss with your final blow or it bugged. Im willing to bet that if you shot all the crystals at him and used magic and arrows you probably killed him and that it didnt bug.I already posted about the Coal bug. and  will be fixed sometime this weekend I think. Along with a ton of new fixes.,Magicite,cfftu1k,1,t5_2xz2b

1227487,0,t3_285tdc,Yeahthe axe effect on the viking helmet also does this. The bug with the enemies is slightly annoying but we can usually just spam our specials to get rid of anything invisible.Would be nice to get it fixed though,Magicite,ci7pkvw,1,t5_2xz2b

1538139,0,t1_cj92g2k,The tried and true RemnantGorgon Eye but I threw in Miner Cap for extra resources and it was truly worth it.I also went through a Crater biome which was... Amazing. I of course have no way to prove it because it was a spur of the moment but I had two space butterflies stacked on each other under a platform in a thin area... Theres no way I could have survived that and yet I did.,Magicite,cj92wv8,1,t5_2xz2b
1794349,0,t3_2f1qgh,The only thing that is hard now in . is the scourge lair but that doesbt mean its not possible. It is still pretty easy if you take your time. Speedrunning and not taking a single hit at the scourge lair has become quite hard though.If you want to win a run just go archer kill every mob and mine everything including stone.Also crater biome is still frikkin hard sean pls nerf,Magicite,ck5bsat,1,t5_2xz2b
2065879,0,t3_2ihwen,Ive had similarsounding problems before. This game is one of the most unusual cases Ive personally experienced as it seems like almost no two groups of people experience the same difficulties in terms of connectivity. Normally for me it seems like the first run is buggy but the next run fixes itself a bit. What time span has this been happening in? Has it just been one night? It could be a temporary problem that resolves itself in a day or so.,Magicite,cl2f3c0,1,t5_2xz2b
2078118,0,t1_cl3pvf8,The inventory would be more limiting if you as you said couldnt toss things.Are you ranged?  Well webs ore leather sticks and herbs are about all you need.  The rest is just gold.  Add in that you can sorta cheat the system and stack more than  of something it makes things a bit easier you can drop a stack of  while having a stack of  in your inventory the system picks up the stack and adds it to the  but does not split it so you end up with  and a free slot.Once you have a decent bow yes you can get magicalrarewhatever bows from crafting them you can basically ignore webs.As a mage you have more to juggle as you are trying to collect three different types of bugs webs sticks sorta and ore for higher tier gear.A warrior has it easy as he has no use for bugs or webs beyond the random zweildhander or whatever its spelled.  No need for a bow nor a wand so ore herbs and food are about it.  Of course gold is always welcome especially with the new altars.What Id like to see is a better inventory management to kinda account for the different classes.Now before you ask  yes bugs are practical for all play styles due to the drums and thus leather and wood are helpful.  But Ive yet to find it practical to actually use the drums in single player as typically if I need one Im already on my way to being dead.,Magicite,cl3z2uh,2,t5_2xz2b
