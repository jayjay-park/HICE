5948327,0,t3_3wtt4h,Reposted on behalf of Cmdr LordCommissarRaziel  I really enjoyed our sparringfight today. It ended rather weirdly with me charging banzai into you i certainly died but i think i got you too since i got quite the bounty to cash in after I respawned.Im looking forward to our next engagement dont get yourself killed by anyone else until then. I hope i dont violate any subreddit rules by posting this but this can generally be seen as a recommendation to wing up with Avenger if you are looking for pvp since i got the impression that he was doing really good I would have completly lost if the police wasnt on my sideWith highest Regards Cmdr LordCommissarRaziel,ChindiMalistso,cxzctvo,1,t5_3bb9o
