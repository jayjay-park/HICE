5576358,1,t1_cwo7r19,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC   has now acknowledged that the mechanism of fluorides benefits are mainly topical not systemic. There is no need whatsoever therefore to swallow fluoride to protect teeth. Since the purported benefit of fluoride is topical and the risks are systemic it makes more sense to deliver the fluoride directly to the tooth in the form of toothpaste. Since swallowing fluoride is unnecessary and potentially dangerous there is no justification for forcing people to ingest fluoride through their water supply.ArticlesAnd there was a big article about the Harvard study from the AP but appears to have been removed.StudiesThere are others but I am working now and dont have much time to redditEdit Thanks UActivistsforTruth,sanmarcos,cwoas2z,-1,t5_2rsch
