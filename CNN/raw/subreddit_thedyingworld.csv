10489770,0,t1_dcx4e6s,it was the reddit april fools thing last year there was a button and you could only press it once per account. when it went  seconds without being pressed it was all over. the subreddit for it became like this huge emergent roleplay thing. imo it was super cool,thedyingworld,dcx4j2d,2,t5_3iqkw

11381652,0,t1_dflzx0e,Yeah I think a lot of games of Nomic say a proposal can only change  single rule. Our rule Meta gets close but isnt quite explicit and a lot of are tables seem to be rules themselves rather than having text in the ruleset backing them up which makes amendments a complicated process. I probably started this mess by going a bit overboard the last few turns but ideally proposals would be kept simpler yes. uLeitioonfire basically anything can be within the jurisdiction of the judge it at least one player insists on it per rule Meta.,thedyingworld,dfm3aeh,1,t5_3iqkw

11645610,0,t1_dgfzxvy,I could also stylize it a bit for example make long island small enough that it looks like an island mess with the scale. If the map stays more accurate eventually you just have big landmasses everywhere.,thedyingworld,dgg1l0m,1,t5_3iqkw
