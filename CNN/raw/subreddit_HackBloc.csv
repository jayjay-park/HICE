9639929,0,t1_da1azuh,A decentralized contract system is pretty much all it takes. The humans would just be the utilizers of the system. In a decentralized system the users use a peer to peer system to be the infrastructure to host the service.I posted a few cryto currency based projects above that are intending to do specifically what OP is looking for. It is definitely feasible but raising funds designing developing and successfully rolling out a crypto currency based service is full of pitfalls. Im not sure what state any of the projects are in ie are any usable currently.,HackBloc,da1biob,3,t5_2rwwm
