629001,0,t3_21cngh,It certainly could be.  A lot of gout is genetic some people are going to have issues no matter how much of a low purine diet they are on.  Red meat organ meats and beer are all very high in purines which in turn can cause your uric acid levels to be high.You should try to get a blood test and see what your uric acid level is.  High uric acid is a very good indicator though not  accurate of gout.  If you do have high uric acid there are medications you can take to get it under control.  You dont want to let it go because you will get more attacks more frequently and more pain.  Over time it damages your joints.Your age doesnt mean anything.  Im  and have had ankle issues for several years and recently pain in my wrist always diagnosed as tendonitis.  I finally changed doctors and had a uric acid test.  My first test measured  mgDL.  Normal is under . but if you suffer from gout youll want to get it well under that if you can trying to stay at  or under.  ,gout,cgbro3d,5,t5_2syer

2539257,0,t3_2orz2z,You sound a lot like myself  years ago.  I had my first attack when I was about   now after drinking a huge amount of jungle juice which was pretty much juice concentrate beer ice and vodka.  It was good going down but I thought I sprained my knee which ended up being gout.  I wasnt sure what it was until about a week or two later but ever since then Ive had an attack maybe once or twice a year.  I really cant stress how much keeping hydrated has helped me avoid more severe attacks so drink that HO up!  Especially after a night of drinking I would down as much as I could before bed.  You might have to weewee in the middle of the night but its worth it.  Ive also found it really helpful for me to stick to hard alcohol only and if I must mix use a mixer with no sugar.  My drink now is vodka soda with extra limes.   It is an embarrassing subject but youll find that there are more people that have had it than you think.  Good Luck!,gout,cmq0mfm,3,t5_2syer

Only you can feel sorry for yourself... we can empathize here but I wont agree with sympathizing in this forum with a few exceptions since we are all dealing with it. In the wrong state of mind its likely that youre not sticking to the right choices either my guess.

5480464,0,t3_3q57by,Only some vegetables are off limits due to purines. Most are okay.I went vegetarian a few years ago after getting  attacks per year. That number has dropped off dramatically and any attack I do get last for a few days at most past attacks lasted weeks. Your mileage may varyThe guidelines given here regarding purines in vegetables are generally along the lines of what I follow.Keep the water intake up lose weight if thats an issue. The more I read about it the more I realise gout is often a result of bad diet and lifestyle AND that most peoples definition of what constitutes a healthy lifestyle is a bit skewy.

9413577,0,t3_4rghk6,Last saturday I was doing some heavy physical activity outdoors where I sprained my left pinky and I thought my left big toe. Pain didnt set in at first but kept building during the next day. That night I was completely unable to sleep. Next day I went to the ER  by taxi since I cant drive and dragging my left foot because I couldnt support myself on it. Went home after having had xrays done with the nothingisbrokenpat on the shoulder. Had to hop on one leg back to my place after having a friend pick me up. I barely made it up the stairs. Night was coming!Day three of agony daytime wasnt so bad. Stayed in bed. Wish I could get painkillers but stuck on third floor with no elevator. Takeout for the second night in a row. Night is coming! What a horrible night to have a curse. So I called the emergency medical service again mostly in frustration because this couldnt be right. I described my symptoms again as well as the pain cycles and the doctor started to talk about gout. I googled the thing. It could have been my big toe on those pictures. If this isnt gout then I might just have to shoot myself. This is hard seeing noone has any guns in Denmark. Seeing I cant walk my chances are even lower. Seeing my left pinky is still sprained Id have to use my right hand as well. The universe has a sense of humour. I may just have to sob inwardly instead in my corner.  So. I was told to go to my personal doctor tomorrow. This is going to be a challenge. Will need to get taxi will need to hop on one leg. If I had a rabbit suit Id probably wear it just for the absurdity of it all. Also this. Is. Hell. I swear to God this cant be right. In no properly maintained universe can this be right. Im supposed to made of stars damnit! Not redhot excrutiating horrific pain.. Also I just spent an hour and a half gathering up the courage to go from my living room to my bedroom where my remaining painkillers are. Now I shall take them. Oh boy shall I take them.
