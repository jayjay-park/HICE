10077429,0,t3_5k40gv,As a rule none of the DLC are required to use any of MampTs features. As far as I know all youll really be missing is the somewhat lackluster and gamey dynasty system and great power diplomatic options.For the other features MampT already has ruler personalities doesnt use the unique governments for certain tags if one is needed the devs just make their own and the religious flavor is already handled by DG. Institutions are part of the free patch for obvious reasons and were really the biggest change made in the DLC.,MEIOUandTaxes,dbl3yzt,4,t5_3hyxw

So if you have a low end PC its possible that you are just taxing the limits.As for improving performance nothing but the usual. Turn down your settings.,MEIOUandTaxes,dgx8gh4,1,t5_3hyxw
