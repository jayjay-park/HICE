Being a smaller Fraternity that wants to grow continued issues caused by the backlash that IFC and the University imposes upon the entire Greek system that only a few organizations are responsible forgot caught for. Having the number of new organizations continue to grow without restrictions while the feeding pool of people interested in rushing remains the same. We mostly have managed to continue to succeed by being abnormally successful in recruiting people who were initially uninterested in rushing or would never rush . kk. k for rush another k for socials. A campus provided rush list helps meet people in the Summer. These Summer contacts help us recruit their acquaintances in the Fall. Otherwise volunteering during move in day and have strong relations with the girls are the best methods.

5211636,0,t3_3mcjac,That Fraternity that extended you an invitation to be a founding father is very likely breaking IFC policies. Ive personally seen  expansions during my time at my school and every single one of them waited until after all of the other Greek organizations finished their expansions before they started recruiting.I would first figure out if this bid you received was kosher and if not drop them like a bad habit. Any organization who is willing to cheat in order to expand their first class is probably pretty desperate for membership.,GreekLife,cve70xv,-3,t5_2s7y5

5392476,0,t1_cw0weur,The argument generally goes that fraternities are the biggest reason why kids die of alcohol poisoning and get raped in college. That is patently not true and any reasonable person would be able to admit that. Thats what dspf was saying.What Greek organizations should be doing is leading movements on campus for more responsible alcohol consumption and less stupid laws about alcohol consumption. They should be organizing events where they invite the whole campus not just greeks to learn how to help stop sexual assault. Because its not just a Greek problem and its not even primarily a Greek problem but we are supposed to be leaders anyway.,GreekLife,cw0y68y,2,t5_2s7y5
5692761,0,t1_cx2pz4h,Oh wow thats super strange! A lot of multicultural Greek letter organizations do recruitment different than panhel.

9967881,0,t3_5i7k4c,Single best Chapter house had a large unused attic space that they turned into a marijuana grow house.  Started as a secret side project by a botany student but turned into a chapterwide business that actually made it so they were living rentfree for quite awhile.  Thankfully the adults NationalsAlumni found out before CampusCops did and shut the whole thing down quick and quiet.  Honorable mention that DIDNT get shut down Chapter was temporarily condemned by the EPA.  They had recently been REALLY low on membership and had a large amount of vacant rooms.  As they were growing they went in to clean out these rooms full retired members crap and in the process were shoveling stuff into old boxes to be thrown out.  They got distracted midcleanup and left the boxes in the middle of the room to get later.  Three weeks of later go by and one of the chemistry guys moving the boxes notices what he instantly recognizes as a pile of mercury on the floor.  It seems a suspiciously heavy jar of stuff that was shoveled into the boxes was actually about lbs of mercury someone had pilfered from the schools chemistry labs. When they were cleaning someone must have shoveled the jar into the box sideways or cracked it and started a slow leak. Three weeks of summertime marinating and the mercury had evaporated throughout the entire house.  The chapter president called the fire department who batphoned the EPA and about an hour later about half the states environmental police was at the house.  They waved their sniffers around and immediately condemned the place until it could be re mediated.  Contractors had to gut huge hunks of shower drains and replace nearly all of the drywall. The best thing was that the alumni board was totally cool about the whole issue.  Even though they could have totally nuked the membership and gone absolutely crazy they recognized that no current members were involved in this fuckup and blaming them wouldnt help anyone.  Nationals didnt have much to say as everyone was reacting properly and the alumni were chill.  This is also one of my best stories of brothers supporting brothers.  ,GreekLife,db6uaks,7,t5_2s7y5
