5287866,0,t1_cvngb90,Nice to know! One more huge favour to ask can you talk to the guy whos making the hitboxes. Malachite and Huge Malachites hitboxes make it near impossible to click the towers near to it. It keeps getting kinda annoying,GemTD,cvnl59w,1,t5_32ekz

8988205,0,t1_d7oieru,You micro by turning off the towers to control who gets the mvpsthen turn them back on later as well as selecting the towers and telling them who to attack. Generally i have all the towers that slowstun in a nd set and try to rotate them hitting different creeps. SO the damage towers are blasting whoever they blast but the slows get spread out.,GemTD,d7s8slm,1,t5_32ekz
8995837,0,t1_d7qyufp,Yeah you can select towers and use the stop command. I like to put all the towers that im stopping in  control group for easy turn onturn offs. Also later putting the slowstun towers in a control group so you can shift them around and get more stuns out of them ,GemTD,d7t5s0o,2,t5_32ekz
9008260,0,t3_53mso4,Ive only been able to clear p once myself and it was with a secret tower Agate..As for p Ive cleared around  times with no secrets and only using lvl  heal to take away damage from round  leaks.Generally to pass p have hpduranium with mvp a goldpariba with mvp then another phys damage dealer with mvp I would do x gold x uranium x hpd or red coral imo,GemTD,d7unh3i,1,t5_32ekz
9023621,0,t3_53mso4,How many games do you have? It took me almost  games to beat solo. You need basic understanding which towers are better than the others then its all about luck rolling them.,GemTD,d7whxqr,1,t5_32ekz
9285175,0,t1_d8swtox,i had the carved tourmaline which does a pretty good amount of physical damage. i may have leaked some of them but with heal lvl its not a big deal to leak a little amount of enemies and doesnt need many shells to get heal lvl . ,GemTD,d8syoku,1,t5_32ekz
9617186,0,t1_d9y5o77,I mean sure the ys spot helped but Ive had this plus U plus red coral plus e and I still lost with  mvp bonuses and great micro.,GemTD,d9yikz4,1,t5_32ekz
9806160,0,t3_5foetw,I would say. Heal  crit or attack speed  swap. th skill doesnt rly matter imo. ,GemTD,daltir2,2,t5_32ekz
9878846,0,t1_dav5r8i,Hehe well I can confirm that the new tower is actually great for p and it is even pretty good in p if things work out p is a whole different can of worms wo building past  that needs to change TTBecause of heal  maybe take grey jadelaz insted of lcj but if you find yourself leaking the odd creep then lcj is still an amazing tower and has antifly  so it stacks with laz as well.The carpet rider is a bitch. youll leak him half the time unless you have stunys on top of good damage at . no worries youll get that hp back one way or another by  for sure.In the end this is all theoretical ofc it depends entirely on the perfect gems and the gems in gems in general you get.,GemTD,dav8jee,1,t5_32ekz

11487765,0,t1_dfy3kwf,Yeah. If you havent ground out a ton of shells beating this game is almost impossible even if you know exactly what youre doing. It sounds like youre doing the right thing by afking for other players to farm shells. Once you get them just wait for the good stuff to go on sale. Swap not Adjacent Swap its a different skill is necessary for mazing. You cant build a very big maze without Swap. An offensive skill is probably good like Haste Shoot or Crit. I like Haste Shoot. Havent tried Crit but it might be good. I wouldnt try any of the others. Then you need something to help you get the right towers. Hammer is nice because its soooooo frustrating to downgrade a tower and get the wrong one. Time Lapse is awesome but towards the end you may only be missing a couple of towers so you can Time Lapse over and over again and still come up short. Perfect Pray may be good. I havent tried it. Some people build heroes just to get secret towers like Perfect Pray Flawless Pray and Opal Pray to make Es and EHOMEs EE.,GemTD,dfy4xqt,1,t5_32ekz
11603655,0,t1_dgb9449,Lets see. For example if you buff an HPD with crit  it will be the following on each attack   of doing  damage.  If  doesnt trigger  of doing  damage.  If  doesnt trigger it does the regular damage.As you can see it loses effectivity as the second crit chance is nullified if the first happen.Then you have the other towers on which crit is bad because Split shot towers like Uranium or Agate Only works on main target crit is an awful choice on this towers. Magic towers like AB Jade Yhome and Miss shrimp Proc based like the previous crit isnt good for those. Towers that do good physical damage but have procs like ECT Golem Egypt Gold Dark Emerald Faster attacks mean more procs which is the main thing you want from this towers damage is secondary.Though there are some exceptions on which crit is better than haste mainly because they dont have inbuilt crit and are mainly damage based Obsidian already have very high attack speed so stacking more of it loses efficiency Aquamarines mainly Q or simply dont need the extra attack speedGold Deepsea Pearl Red Coral.  Obsidian is a secret tower so its unlikely to appear Q has a similar situation and the last  arent good for damage purposes either because of weak damage awful range or both. Anyways crit doesnt make that much of a difference on any of this towers either.Crit used to be a very solid option on par with haste during physical meta back a few months ago now its inferior.,GemTD,dgba846,1,t5_32ekz
11649767,0,t3_6687la,. I usually dont build in the exact center until after wave  and try to get a Yellow Sapphire in that spot. I try to go for a couple good block placements early on so long as i can close the  pass maze by wave .. I try to get Asteriated Ruby as soon as possible then go for silvers or malas. Only time I pick a flawed gem over a component for the malas or silvers  is if I get a component for a tower I want in my x center like an Y for ECT or E for Red Coral. . Silvers have a hard time to pass wave  unless you get Silver knight or  silvers near the middle with some auras and a  pass maze by then. Im sure having an ability like haste would make you able to pass this every time though.I rarely go for Malas but from memory it felt like they were weaker against the boss on wave  so a Huge Malachyte or a Jade might be necessary.For wave  you either need a lot of damage or a stun tower. Only passed this once without the stun tower and a bunch of times with it. This is where I leak the most often. Might be able to sub the stun tower for a Yellow Sapphire and still pass but I generally dont get it this early because I dont have swap so I need to get a component in the dead center which can take a few turns.Wave  Antique BloodstoneI think both wave  and  have untouchable youll need a deep sea pearl for them. You can probably make a more comprehensible list but these are the waves I most often leak on. Once youre in the  territory youll want to complete all of your towers either way.. Before wave  I focus on getting the chipped gems for my  SilversMalachites and  Asteriated Ruby. I always combine into a R for a fast Asteriated Ruby. I picked flawed gems over SilverMala components only if they  appear in the center and can be upgraded to a tower I want on that spot.Ive also tried not building any SilverMalachite components at the start in hopes of getting a one shot Mala or Silver before I commit to either. It sometimes pays off and sometimes doesnt.If you have gotten to level  you probably knew some of this or have your own strategies. Gotten to wave  a few times but Im by no means an expert. ,GemTD,dggik0c,2,t5_32ekz
11803306,0,t3_68dpu5,Well wall of text incoming.P B E and R are the best ones IMO  P gives  armor massive reduction especially against drodos also very good against reactive armor B gives a very good slow of  plus it has a small AOE. Very good unless you get the great stone secret tower which is very unlikely. E Gives  attack speed aura I have seen most people ditching this tower for EHome since it also has this aura. Still this tower is very good. R Not so good damage by itself but the huge splash radius with  damage makes it outdamage every other tier  tower on anything that isnt a boss.About the rest which I believe they arent so good anymore Q is decent but gets hardcountered by kraken shell plus its single target so it has some issues against reactive armor on levels  as you cant avoid it by retargetting due to the lack of splashmultitarget G isnt very good. Doesnt attack much faster than the other emerald towers similar range and the  damage per second poison is a low amount. Y has  range full map but the issue of hitting  targets only plus like the other splitshot towers the damage isnt being correctly applied to the secondary targets. It does fairly well against bosses though. D does good damage but has the downside of being single target so similarly to Q it will have issues agaisnt reactive armor on those levels though it doesnt care a lot about kraken shell.,GemTD,dgxy228,1,t5_32ekz
