But Im not a native speaker. I felt like theyre putting too much weight on grammar  punctuation etc.,langara,cfn9ivl,1,t5_2sgyr

4343825,0,t3_3aquhb,Depends on the course and teacher! If you are aiming to get into a popular course with a popular teacher be prepared for a wait list or have a second less popular option that you would be willing to turn to. You cannot be waitlisted for a class that you are already registered in so make your gamble wisely. Ex Bio  with Mrs X is full you cannot be on the waitlist for Mrs Xs class and also register for Bio  with Mr Y.If you are th on the waitlist youll probably be alright. Ive been th and have gotten into classes. However if youre th it may be a better choice to go for a different teacher or have another class  you could register for. Or just go on the waitlist and see what happens! Often big drops in the waitlist occur closer to september when fee payments become due and people forget to pay. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favour! ,langara,csfa3i4,3,t5_2sgyr

So it would bear the same consequences as getting an F in that class i.e. bring down your GPA and not count as a prerequisite for further classes in that subject.It would not affect your chances of admission any more than an F would. Unless you are going into a very specific program most universities look at overall GPA in universitytransferable courses and not your grade in any particular course although this may happen when you apply for your major after being accepted at UBC at least.,langara,d53lgk2,1,t5_2sgyr
