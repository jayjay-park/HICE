8207109,0,t3_4rjgxc,Language is traditionally acquired through ears. So even before literature one needs to invest on that. A useful starting point could be harikathes of Achyut Dasaru and Gururajulu Naidu and audio lectures of Manku Timmana Kagga quite many are on youtube. Its both kaavya and kathe at the same time narrated and explained in an engaging and humourous way. Please continue to read Kannada newspapers and top it up with prose of people like Poornachandra Tejaswi and SL Bhairappa. Its accessible and engaging at the same time. Then you could take up vachanas dasara pada poetry of G S Shivarudrappa K S Narasimhaswamy H S Venkateshmurthy Nissar Ahmed etc. ...You could start with Modala Odu series published by Akshara Prakashana..... its a compilation of the best poems works of these authors  and provides a useful introduction to their work. ....Make it a point to read something everyday and when possible discuss it with others. .... Also lyrics of many songs of people like Hamsalekha Kaikini Udayshankar and others are no less than any poetry. ...Do pay a close attention to lyrics.....Do all of this consistently..... Overtime I am sure it will all add up beautifully well...All the best. ,kannada,d53fyrp,2,t5_2qi7f
