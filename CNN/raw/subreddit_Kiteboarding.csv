I think its a solid premise.The reason why I was tempted to mark it as spam is simply because theres  info on the page you linked. No overview of terms locations nothing. Its a placeholder site designed to capture emails. As a mod this smelled spammy to me as well as the phantom upvotes it seemed to have acquired. Saturday and Sunday traffic on our little sub is quite modest and the rate at which upvotes happened on this was uncommonly quick even compared to popular content here.

3687528,0,t3_32kjjn,One thing I wanted to point out that I havent seen mentioned yet while its important to generate board speed quickly after getting up what keeps the power going is apparent wind speed in the kite. What I mean by this is that your kite also has to be traveling in the same direction with you as the kite starts getting the additional push from the apparent wind generated by your sideways movement the power will increase and so will your boardspeed until the various friction forces equal your board and kite power. Thats how you get to be cruising with the kite parked.  Simply put the apparent wind over your kite is as important if not more than your board speed so keep it in mind. Other thoughts its possible your reading of the wind direction could be a little off and you were maybe pointing higher upwind than you thought. Ive had it happen to me plenty and each spot can deceive you differently. If you slow down and start to sink bear off the wind a bit and see what happens. Finally a lot of kites have options for how the bridlelines are attached to increasedecrease pull and responsiveness. Im not sure about the park but ask a fellow liter or your local shop and they can show you. Probably not the source of your issue but could contribute. ,Kiteboarding,cqclpkf,2,t5_2qs1x

7196563,0,t1_d1w2ssk,If thats the reason youre doing it you might want to try adjusting your technique a bit because you shouldnt really be using arm muscle to pull the bar in but your body weight. Try keeping your arms almost totally straight and really leaning back into your harness. You should feel very little engagement of your arms since your skeleton is doing most of the work. In the long run itll let you kite longer since youre not using as much strength and will save you from tendinitis as well the way youre riding is a really good way to get tennis elbow. If your absback ever get sore or tired this will help with that too since youre not using muscle to hold yourself upright youre letting the pull of the kite flow straight down into your boards edge to do all the work.

10489143,0,t1_dcqmj9p,I think Neilpryde agrees that an active racing scene is important. Apparently theyre trying to recruit ambassadors to organize local events and their online shop already offers race markers jump buoys promotional items etc. Intuitively it seems to me that standardized equipment could also be a helpful ingredient to building a thriving race scene. The Kona class sprung to popularity pretty quickly in the windsurfing world.Im not sure I would want to commit to racing events beacuse if its really windy on an event day Id probably prefer to go ride waves have a bigair session etc. Perhaps this mentality accounts in part for why we dont see more organized kite racing scenes?
