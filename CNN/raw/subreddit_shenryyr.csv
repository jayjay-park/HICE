3507498,0,t3_30f23m,Obviously Im not Shen but the Extended Timeline mod has plenty of issues. For starters I think that beginning on the first starting date which is like  AD if I recall correctly will result almost ALWAYS in the world forming improperly. For example Rome wont ever truly split up and there is a chance that Byzantine wont even spawn. Hed obviously have to play a smaller nation but Im afraid that Shen might actually conquer the world before it has enough time to get all the techs unlocked.Otherwise I actually really like that mod but there are still some glaring issues. Also Im not sure if its updated for the latest version of EUIV. Ill check again after this post.Edit I stand corrected it was updated  days ago I guess. It still seems like the mod needs a lot of work though.,shenryyr,cps2vta,2,t5_31htq
