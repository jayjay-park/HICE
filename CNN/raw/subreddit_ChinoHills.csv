The thing with CH is that even though the video is old its still dead on because with all the recent developments its all the same. The Shoppes was like when I realized how badly the city wanted to be like Orange County hahaha. Thats cool though! Taiwan! Ive never even been outside the country so that must be really exciting for you. I know a lot of people that have had to move back to the hills for a while after college. Hopefully I avoid that but even if I dont its cool maybe Id appreciate things a bit more... Eh maybe. lol,ChinoHills,ckf1lcq,1,t5_2togw

I never heard about The Cult until I ended up in Jr. High which is when we started investigating all the Chino Hills paranormal things. Such as the AeroJet compound the green mist and Pig Face back in hills off of Woodview technically within Heavens ranch. Good times.Very interesting article. Still extremely vague as to what goes on but piques a whole lot of ideas none the less. Thanks! You can see the ocean from Carbon Canyon?! Too cool man. I wish I knew about that when I was cruising around in my  Honda Accord looking for areas to take my lady friends for the evening. ,ChinoHills,cmsakyv,2,t5_2togw
