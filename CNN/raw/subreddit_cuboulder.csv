4276852,0,t3_39hkxf,Agreed with rijnzael if you were minmaxing for grad school they would likely be more much impressed with a higher GPA than  majors. From what I understand doubletriple majoring is mainly worth it if a you can maintain a high gpa in all majors b the classes youre taking to obtain the extra majors are relevant to what you want in grad school. Blahblahblah they doesnt really help you now though.Hows your GPA in the upper division courses for those majors? That can have a larger impact than overall GPA. Research will help but a lot of applicants will also have research. GREs are usually just used for cutoff. I would use the resources at your school for writing a personal statement rather than reddit. Plenty of things to do outside and inside. Its a pretty small city though. Cost of living kinda sucks  the wiki doesnt directly answer this but if you want to live close to campus  min walkyoure going to be paying at least  in rent average is probably  plus another  in utilities.

Meanwhile my little Aggies are paying Sumlin a ridiculous  million a year and were probably firing him soon because our teams record has been         but doesnt matter beat Bama.  So  versus  is a pretty big season difference for less than . million salary gap.  .  Now Im not saying we should all be spending billion dollars on football but at some point you really have to accept that football is an integral part of large public universities and that its a business.

Theyd have to run a background check which requires your consent and I dont think Ive ever seenheard of that on scholarship applications.  That being said employers might not like that get it expunged if you can.  ,cuboulder,ddhlkq4,2,t5_2r8y0

10968992,0,t3_5wmhfo,I would apply for the BA. Not  sure that its easier to get into but theres no way the BS is easier. It wouldnt be too hard to switch after a decent semester if you really wanted a BS. The only major difference between the two is the BS requires a senior capstone project ,cuboulder,debdh1l,4,t5_2r8y0

Those who work on the backend of CUBoulder systems dont see DL amp myCU as clunky tools for students but as services that handle an upwards of  users that create millions of requests per day at least during peak enrollment times.

11464600,0,t3_63h0bm,I think transfer studentsupperclassman needed to submit housing applications a few weeks ago... If thats the case than the dorms are not an option which is probably a good thing for you.TransferWest is in Williams Village which I would not recommend. As an upperclassman and not a freshman living in Will Vill you will be a lot further isolated from main campus and the culture of CU. Id suggest living on the hill. Since youre already in a strat itll probably meet your expectations as far as what the college experience should be. Dorms will only disappoint.,cuboulder,dfvi7lv,2,t5_2r8y0
11481938,0,t1_dfx3bie,In short diversity of background diversity of thought and diversity of intention. Each leads to the next. Student government needs people with varied backgrounds to ensure that it approaches problems from a variety of perspectives not just one. Ultimately diversity in CUSG means a staff of representatives who come at problems from different angles while pursuing the same goals.Diversity is not tokenism it is not halfhearted efforts to impress minority student groups whose votes you need and it is certainly not attainable without a diverse ticket. We want to represent you no matter who you are what you think or where you came from.Weve been highly frustrated with tickets no names mentioned in the past that have relied on the fraternity vote to get elected without bothering to reach out to any other communities. Well never do that because were committed to representing the campus at large even if it makes our road to victory more difficult. Owen M,cuboulder,dfxh4eh,5,t5_2r8y0
