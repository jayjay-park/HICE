10055697,0,t1_dbi85t4,Yeah I didnt know what all went down after I left. Jude tried to be my friend and asked for my number and called me. When I called back it just answered and hung up. If I tried to call any other time that would happen and I think it was just Kimmi trying to keep me from hearing her voicemail. Every time anyone questioned anything we were met with hatefulness and then they started asking for money for stuff. I thought it was an in character sub which was fun at first but then I realized they were trying to make everyone think it was real.I basically posted that I thought they were fake and scammers some people that still defended them jumped on me but some others were like Ive thought the same and then that was the end of it for me. ,Imaginaryjack,dbia5i4,1,t5_2ymnr
