8799479,0,t3_50n5b7,Are you going over seas? Even . wont be too common over there. Thing is if its back here its probably just Fudds being Fudds. . is a fine cartridge. Good thing is if you stick with the fullsizes they can take the same lights and holsters so long as its a light bearing holster. I have a TLR adapted to the USP no adapter on the gun necessary and it works great.,USPmasterrace,d75ksrw,3,t5_39ka4
