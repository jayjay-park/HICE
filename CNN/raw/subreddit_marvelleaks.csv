7280216,0,t1_d248bha,Hawkeye is swiftly becoming one of my favorites. I hope they do a movie with him and Black Widow.,marvelleaks,d25pn6c,2,t5_39hu8
7295364,0,t1_d24q587,true I just find it really sad. I want to see them being able to get rid of the triggers etc. and let him heal. Overall the decision makes sense they dont have the ability to remove the triggers yet and he doesnt want to be a risk to lose himself again. I just think its really sad.,marvelleaks,d27flz7,2,t5_39hu8
