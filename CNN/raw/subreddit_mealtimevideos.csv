This timing is not precise and it can get mixed up if someone gets tripped up or slows down.  If jumpers exist both doors at the same time it is possible though rare for them to collide with one another beneath the plane before their chutes fully deploy.Accidents and tangles happen regularly.

9676631,0,t1_da5r01c,The message gets lost a little in the video but around  the narrator saysgtSince the image that gets recorded into the Alexa is so flat with so much to work with it takes a ton of skill and work to get the perfect look. Its often easier to sit with the flat style and just embrace it.In other words while a flat look can be solved with color grading it helps a lot if the colors come out more vibrant from the camera in the first place. Because Marvel has a formulaic approach to postproduction perhaps by switching the camera and keeping the postproduction process the same they can achieve a more colorful look without compromising their established process. ,mealtimevideos,da5ujij,6,t5_32abf

9838834,0,t1_daq05wv,gt Race relations degrade because of things like slavery. An entire race is seen as being subservient  inferior. That leaves scars on a society echoes that last for decades.There is no such thing as race relations its a bullshit construct. Individuals have relationships with other individuals. I dont have a relations with black people in general. I have relations with some individuals who happen to be black. Some of them I like some of them I dont and their race has nothing to do with it either way.Inferior? What proportion of white Dutch people see black people as inferior? It cant be more than . I want to see some specifics that actually affect peoples lives rather than these vague incoherent scars and echoes.gtThen you are dumb.Unless you have data to prove me wrong you can go fuck yourselfgt You dont have to be an evil racist to normalize racism. You can have great intentions and still do it by accident.gtYou dont have to be a cross burning white nationalist with swastika tattoos and evil overflowing in your heart to be racist.You dont get to tell me what I think. You take yourself to be more qualified to say whats in my head than me. gtA negative racial theme tells children that its okay to be mean to people because of their race. That is accepting and making racism normal for them.What exactly tells children that its okay to be mean to people because of their race? My argument isnt that its okay to do that but that harmful remarks will come your way no matter what and you need to learn not to give a shit what some random mean shithead says if you want to live in this world. A kid with big nose who gets made fun of for having a big nose feels bad about himself just as much as black kid who gets made fun of for being black. Being made fun of for something you have no control over hurtsgtStop equating black skin which has a very specific very long very recent and very violent history of oppression with any random genetic trait you can think of. You fucking idiot.You still didnt explain what that history has to do with an  year old who ISNT EVEN AWARE OF IT.

Media Matters is just a progressive version of doing exactly what Jones does after all scare the supporters into further division from the rest of everyone.  Jones has never hurt anyone. Hes talked poorly about Sanders.And blaming Jones for what his supporters do regarding Sandy Hook is not fair Otherwise I could blame Clinton for what her supporters have done since she lost the election various cases of assault rioting vandalism etc. Jones himself has never been there harassing the families of victims and never asked his viewers to do so. Note Im not defending what he does or what he says. Its vapid baseless fearmongering bottom line. Im simply saying the reasons why he does it are clear Money. Not to start a revolution. Asserting he is ohsodangerous is exactly the same fearmongering that he utilizes. Its not based in evidence or fact its a demagogues argument One tied to emotions and relying on pulling heartstrings.

10543116,0,t1_dd3085e,Not sure how much your interested since Im technically in agreement with you to some degree but I have other qualms with this whole thing.This ban feels like feel good politics. I dont believe this sort of ban will stop a terrorist act because their biggest targets are converting people to extremist views over the internet. As such anything along the lines of were banning them for term so we can fix the vetting process in the next couple months also doesnt ring with meIm not convinced that will help either.Of course theres also the weirdness in the specific countries banned. An easy example is my confusion on why countries like SA isnt on the list. My assumption goes back to the original point of this feeling like feel good politics.As for some of the points you brought upI do not support a great deal of Obamas politics and so its of zero consequence who originally listed the countries. A cursory glance at the Obamalist thing also mentions  countries which again adds to the why wasnt it all these other countries too?. Not really a big deal either way though.the   month long thing confuses me. Those are for processing of refugee requests something much more limiting and possibly entirely separateunless I missed it we should still be processing refugee requeststhey just cant have the final you can come now stamp due to this. Very different situations but the  thing was horrific stuff as well. A quick check tells me this was clumped in a bit with the whole why arent we allowing our foreign war interpreters into our country like we promised situation and that  month stop may have been directly responsible for at least one interpreter deathpeanuts considering we didnt allow most of them in at all. In terms of actual lack of  reporting Ill generally be in agreement. Regardless the whole media situation is another tangential topic that while I may agree with in some way it doesnt change my view on this executive order.Whether its legal or not isnt my issue.I dont understand the point of the Israel thing besides you maybe expecting the people that reply to also completely support of the governments of those countries?The only thing Ill say with the weve been bombing them is that I dont support a great deal that we have done in that part of the world for the last few decades. It still doesnt change my view on the executive order.I have never seen an article that goes into any amount of detail on the vetting process of incoming refugees. Id even wager that some of the process is classified and as such not even Trump knew entirely about it until after taking office. Assuming that the vetting process is currently in a state of disrepair is bad. If it truly is full of holes sure I might start to consider this kind of executive order making sense. Without some form of evidence that this vetting process is bad I have zero incentive to believe the executive order is anything more than political grandstanding that ultimately hurts not helps.,mealtimevideos,dd36hfn,11,t5_32abf

11535693,0,t1_dg3kbfi,Hi. OP here. I think the number one reason the show still works is really simple the people making the show are really talented. But how interesting of a video would that be to watch? So I wanted to delve into some of the details that I personally really enjoy about the show that I think add a lot to its rewatchability. The relationship each character has with their parents and this self imposed stasis being two of the major ones.I havent seen Frasier so I cant comment on that but I think its rare for a show to still be so funny after being on the air for as long as Sunny has been. As to trying to sound smart I mean? Obviously? Whos trying to sound stupid in these sorts of videos? Im assuming this is the only video of mine that youve seen but usually I pull information from a lot of different sources this is one of the few videos Ive made where its being pulled from my ass. But Im a huge fan of the show Ive seen every episode multiple times and just wanted to share my love of the show and why I think its still so funny with anyone who cared to watch. In the future Id suggest avoiding this kind of content if its just going to piss you off.,mealtimevideos,dg3kn25,1,t5_32abf
