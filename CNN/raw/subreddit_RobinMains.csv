4674501,0,t3_3ez4yk,Nosferatu is certainly an important move in robins arsenal. If you use arc thunder or arc fire you can immediately trap them in a nosferatu from it Ive found it as a good punish when my enemies dont watch carefully. Using it at the right time can turn the tide of the battle. ,RobinMains,ctjrs75,1,t5_398mw
4675018,0,t3_3eza68,From Awakening  MRobin x Lucina. Theyre supports are the best and Morgan. MORGAN. Morgan with deep blue hair is adorable and becomes a destroyer of worlds with Aether. I always think about where Morgans Brand is Or if shes like Lissa and doesnt have one and the fact that she can potentially wield Falchion. Same for Smash. For female Robin though Id say FRobin x Chrom and for Smash Id say FRobin x Shulk as well.,RobinMains,ctju4dp,1,t5_398mw

5611298,0,t1_cws83th,Capt and Shulk are eazy money I think. Robin can handed them if you space hishers aerials well. The air is what makes robin win. The levin sword is just too good and shuts them down. Some good arcfires are great but its best to save it for a kill setup. Elthunders are the best thunder spell for those match ups. It creates space and can kill if sniped at high percent. Yea capt and shulk are eazy money,RobinMains,cwsmw2n,4,t5_398mw

8631034,0,t3_4y2sqw,Shameless plug for my Elwind jab lock percentagesThis combo was not performed by me but rather a user on Smashboards named Lavani. So far the goto way to get the lock is to footstool gt zdrop book gt aerial footstool gt fastfall gt Elwind Cancel So far the fastest faller Ive gotten this to work on is Sheik and it was quite difficult to execute. In general the faster the faller the harder the lock is to perform. While difficult it is certainly doable I dunno about consistently but if anyone knows a good way to consistently Elcancel from a fastfall then let me know. Its pretty situational though. We need a tome in our hands and a footstool. At first glance FOOS footstool out of shield seems like a good idea but Robins abysmal jumpsquat makes this less effective than say Mega Mans footstool combo. Perhaps it is possible after a perfect shield. Who knows. Anyways have fun labbing this. Or not. Whatever.,RobinMains,d6khh3g,2,t5_398mw
