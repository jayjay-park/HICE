But like the others said no it wont work and will require a mosfet to be save the thing would work for a period of time without one but who knows how long and what position is will fail in like open circuit or closed circuit. There are some push button engine start switches that drag racers use that have super high amp DC ratings like A and up. Some are super big some are smaller. Not as small cool or comfortable as the vandal switches.... But bad ass in their own way. ,Boxmods,cwvg5i5,1,t5_30wkr
