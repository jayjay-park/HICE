7523811,0,t3_4ic3bm,I posted my tank Morde build the other day check that out if youre interested but Ill go into detail about other ways of building him for you.Firstly obviously Rylais is the number one item on Morde build it every game either first or second item. The only items I would get before Rylais are Abyssal and maybe the Protobelt. However I wouldnt bother with Liandrys in most games even though it has synergy with Rylais it is a very expensive item that is only ever worth it if you are having trouble with tanks which doesnt ever seem to happen as Morde. I would replace Liandrys with Nashors tooth in your build and that would help you with your attack speed problem btw. Other than that yours is a standard Morde build that should work just fine. For that I would go either Thunderlords or Stormraiders keystone in Masteries and take a standard AP rune page with either Armor or MR depending on the match up.Other than my tank build and the one youre doing the only main other way of building him is full AP Which consists of something like Rylais Abyssal Ludens Death cap and NashorsZhonyas. Usually taking Deathfire touch.,MordekaiserMains,d2xf4xt,1,t5_37hva

Bronze  mid LP wise.Building RylaisgtMRArmor AP items zhonyastheotherthingy aura to lower MR past that situational.Runes are armor Magic pen CDR or occasionally attack speed CDR armor.Most champions especially those with hard CC. I roflstomp the weak champions in lane but then cannot transfer that lead not a morde problem mind but Im gradually sorting it.,MordekaiserMains,d30mzs0,1,t5_37hva

9805855,0,t1_dals1ve,Deathfire touch. Very strong for harassing with E early and since picking it up with this build I find that targets die to my ult way more often where as before it rarely did enough to finish them when I needed it to. and idk why i would need surge to one shot an ADC or how it would even help me do that. If ive already used my damage to get the ms boost how will I burst another target? Ill try and link some plays with this build cause it does do a lot more damage than you would believe.,MordekaiserMains,dals64y,1,t5_37hva

10214733,0,t3_5m9hhp,. MidbotjungleMid is ahrder because most of your matchups are ranged but against melees hes very strongBot is another ok spot it shines with a lockdown support that lets you output damage like naut blitz or thresh.Jungle is great because your clears are fast and healthy but your ganks are subpar.. I run stormraiders due to immobility but you can run dft i run mr movespeed and ap but thats probably the wrong setup.Rylais used to be core its still very strong. Hextech gunbladeprotobelt depenxing on your playstyle and you can build literally whatever else you want. Wits end triforce zzrot steraks gage are all viable in specific builds.. It really depends on how braindead your oppenents are if they want to fight you for extended trades youll almost always win. Personally i think he has a high skill floor but a low skill ceiling.. Eventually yes. Hes on the list for eventual changes.,MordekaiserMains,dc1wbvc,2,t5_37hva
