Its not laziness. Its the loss of motivation to do even the simplest tasks which is prompted by the abandonment of hope.

2035272,0,t1_ckyipkw,There arent really any lines in custody matters. The whole thing is a giant series of judgment calls by the judge. The more things you do that the judge considers harmful to the child the less involved hes going to let you be in the childs life and vice versa. Your jurisdiction probably has a list of criteria that the judge is supposed to use to decide what the childs best interests are. Become familiar with the list talk to your lawyer about it and do what you can to make sure youre doing what the state wants you to do.,SingleParents,ckyj0i2,1,t5_2r6jl

2738867,0,t3_2rdbo3,Pretty normal.  I had to teach my son to get close to the toilet and to put the seat up as dribble just happens.  Itll get better when hes older and can controlpoint better.  I didnt teach him to pee sitting down...toilet dribble isnt that big of a deal and I didnt WANT my son sitting down on public toilets especially at school where all the OTHER boys pee all over the seat and leave it.  My ex teaches him to sit down and cover his penis with toilet paper so it doesnt squirt out and its just infuriating because all that does is redirect the stream back to his genitals and this is why he often comes home from there with a rash from not properly cleaning.  My advice would be keep on him about it remind him not to rush but let him pee standing up.  Dont stress him out about it aiming isnt easy when youre a kid. Practices that Ive heard of include a treat if he can go all day without missing or trying to sink cheerios which gives him a good reason to aim for the water.As an adult you can put your finger at the base of your penis underneath and simply run it up to the tip and it squeezes out excess urine that is usually the cause of dribble...but this is a learned technique and Im not sure how effective it is for a  year olds...setup.Good luck!,SingleParents,cnfebie,3,t5_2r6jl

When I go out with her I dont get any of those type of comments probably because theyre assuming Im a single mom since there is no dad with me.

3848779,0,t3_34h2cs,I handled my daughter solo from  to  before I remarried.  Heres what I said remember when you got the flu and your body was sick?  Well sometimes peoples bodies get sick and sometimes their brains get sick.  Your mommy loves you very much but her brain is really sick and when peoples brains get sick they dont make good choices so its not safe for them to be around children.  The big problem with a sick brain is that sometimes the bad choices include not making the choices that will help your brain get better so I dont know if mommy will ever be okay.  But I thank God every day that I have you and I will always be here for everything you need.As for the stress it happens. Youre dealing with the personal side of being abandoned and the parenting side of being abandoned.  Suck up your pride lean on family and friends and dont feel bad about prioritizing yourself once in a while.

4913893,0,t3_3i4xb0,It sounds like youre really letting your momparents get to you and that youre responding to their comments in an unproductive way. Im not saying that your mother is right...at all. Please dont think Im taking her side Im not. However if you dont fight back then who is fighting? If you dont yell back if you dont add to the conflict in any way then she may change how she approaches you she also may not who knows. Your mom seems to be having a hard time moving from mother of a child to mother of adult child and grandmother. So when she says things like you should have listened to us about... You might say youre right. When she says you need to or you should then you might respond with OK I appreciate your input and I will give it some thought. Along with this it is probably a good idea to be putting your plan together to move out though. As you know it isnt something you can easily do overnight so if you can reduce the conflict in your house while also working on moving out then I think you will be much happier.,SingleParents,cudxllp,2,t5_2r6jl

5773191,0,t3_3u6udd,Its nice to try sharing kiddos things. Unfortunately in my case we couldnt do that at all. My ex has a habit of stealing his kids nice things and giving them to his girlfriends kids. I watched him steal his older kids clothes and send them back to their moms in rags. Because of all this I made damn sure our court papers say each parent is responsible for providing clothing toys medicine etc at each home. My daughters still lost some of her favorite shirts a couple of jackets and a pair of boots because shes terrified to tell her dad no. She now has a specific outfit that she wears for visits. Its an outfit her step sister hates so my daughter wont be told to give it away .Sorry if I hijacked your post. It might be time to set some boundaries with clothes etc and your ex.

7554070,0,t1_d30tl0a,Ive found that I relate to people with kids more than to people my age.  Having kids changes you and who you relate to.  Can you try to find a babysitter through another parent? Getting someone who has worked for someone you know before might relieve some of your anxiety around the situation.  Mom guilt is real and its a bitch and you need to get over it.   Your son is not going to benefit from you feeling alone and sad he will benefit from a parent who is happy and fulfilled and has an outlet.   Definitely try to find some parenting meet ups or something similar in your area.   ,SingleParents,d30v175,2,t5_2r6jl

I keep telling myself she doesnt have to always like me and you should tell yourself that too. If you dont want her to smoke weed you need to confront her and give her consequences. She may be upset that you havent said anything because in her mind not saying anything means you dont care. Therapy might help the both of you. Good luck.

9593705,0,t3_5be94q,Pregnancy hormones make us want to nest so I stayed when shouldnt have and cried how many nights thinking I did something wrong to deserve it. I really hope you have friendampfamily support I didnt and sadly a lot dont which is why we tend to stay in horrible situations since seems like no one else cares because yes its not easy to grief over a partner you wished for and deserved but didnt get though you cant change an abuser and having him around can lead to your children becoming like that too. Sorry I dont mean to scare or upset you and I know pregnancy hormones do make us see world differently because of the brain being in family mode so it is the easiest if you can have some support and company during this time friends and family for those who have them or councellors and phone help lines can be helpful as well as womens shelters. I very much hope everything works out for the best and no one gets hurt anymore and wish all the best to you and your family !!!

Shes  not a kid set boundaries and chores and expectations but other than that let her fly.  She needs a safe and comfortable home not one where shes being micro managed or bullied.  Also remember now you have to do as you say also to show her the good example.  Sucks but when I want my daughter to be up on time that means I have to also and so on regarding laundry cleaning up and hygiene.  But yours is  and mine is almost  so slightly different parenting needs there.Make sure you both have some time for yourselves and then each other.  Stay in therapy and get to the heart of your anger issues.  Try always smiling when youre talking or doing absolutely silly things together.  Its so different when you can look at that young person and say theyre your responsibility now.  Everything changes and you just have to learn to roll with it.  ,SingleParents,dd6ehlw,3,t5_2r6jl
