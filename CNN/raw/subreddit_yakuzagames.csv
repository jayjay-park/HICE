5889591,0,t1_cxrncxl,I dont know for sure but there could have been text embedded in images and the videos not as separate files.Also because the difference in length between a Japanese and English sentence you need a lot of proof reading to make sure labels  appear when they should and  fit where they are supposed to fit.ampnbspThe nature of the characters are different as well  have you played cheap localised games? You can often see words break in the middle which looks rubbish to us but makes sense in those languages.ampnbspIts basically translation combined with graphics designers and play testers then QA  again! So we are talking many hours and many people.Sad but true.,yakuzagames,cxrnr2o,1,t5_2xx8w

8185487,0,t1_d4zr1jz,Agreed really think the hate Ys story gets is undeserved. The individual story arcs are really well done and much better than most of the stories we got before.It feels more mature.,yakuzagames,d50qiyh,1,t5_2xx8w
8984173,0,t3_53b5ua,Ive poured out my thoughts on kiwami on this sub out often enough by now and dont feel like going into detail anymore so let me keep it short kiwami is more a mission pack for yakuza than a remake of yakuza and seeing how the waiting time to y in the west really isnt that long anymore I cant recommend playing it now lest you ruin the freshness of  when it releases. I really think  will have a bigger impact if you play kiwami afterwards instead.,yakuzagames,d7rrcwi,1,t5_2xx8w

10491600,0,t1_dcxbjen,I just find it strange that some of my games which have plenty to do with Japan contain multiple language and text tracks but Japanese is not one of the text options.,yakuzagames,dcxc03u,1,t5_2xx8w
10544926,0,t3_5qujfs,For the entire game Majima was basically trying to help Makoto escape from the yakuza world. Thats the whole reason why he hid her in the first place why he heavily discouraged Makoto from taking revenge and why he was so adamant on killing Dojima in the end before Sera stepped in because he believed that as long as he was alive Makoto would be sucked back into the yakuza world and be in danger all over again.When he saw her after all after all of it was resolved he knew that if he told Makoto that he was the one who saved and protected her all this time then Makoto would probably tried to be heavily involved in Majimas life and he didnt want that as now he was back as a yakuza and Makoto would probably wind up being targeted by the yakuza for some reason or another.. It was probably really painful to ignore her for him as it was for me but he knew that by not approaching her Makoto would never be in danger of getting sucked back into the yakuza world and probably lead a happy life.,yakuzagames,dd3dv96,5,t5_2xx8w

Personally if you really want to play  now rather than wait for the likely HD remake then Id download it and use an emulator.Kiwami  and  are already hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay.,yakuzagames,de26e9u,2,t5_2xx8w

11082939,0,t1_dek3l46,Not OP but I started with Y and just finished Y on PS and I think waiting for Kiwami is the way to go. I felt so disconnected from the story in Y because the characters obviously looked nothing like they did in Y they were voiced in English some had their names changed etc. The story is good but it lost a lot of its emotional impact because I didnt care about the characters like I did in Y. Now I have spoiled the story for myself so Kiwami wont be as dramatic and exciting. If I was doing it again I would do Y Kiwami cutscenes for Y online and then do Y through . I dont think my opinion is popular amongst people who have played the whole series from YY before Y but its just my two cents. ,yakuzagames,deo8p4i,3,t5_2xx8w
11206859,1,t3_5zyvt3,I agree Yakuza  was the first game in the series besides Dead Souls that I outright could not finish. The story was just too predictable the map was where Id been before. The whole thing felt incredibly stale.But I dont think Sega has the resources to make a fresh Yakuza game from the ground up. Sega need to answer to shareholders and the easiest way to do that is by turning out a game every year. And Sega just isnt as big as they once were. For example....Even compared to  the Yakuza heyday Segas stock is at about half of what it was. And Yakuza games have never ever moved the needle for Sega in terms of American sales. Its why Yakuza barely comes out in North America at all. Ive listened to interviews with Yakuza developers and they specifically make the games for Japanese players though they are flattered that the game is liked around the world at all. So with such a small potential market just Japan Sega doesnt have the incentive to really push a big Yakuza development effort.Also Yakuza  was probably Segas biggest attempt to make the game international and it did not sell well enough to bring back the voice actors for Yakuza .Anyway Ive been so disappointed by the Yakuza series that Ive basically given it up. Yakuza was the last reason I had a PS and when Yakuza  was a big disappointment I decided to sell it. If another Yakuza catches my eye in the way of a good revamp Id jump right back in though. I dont see myself playing Yakuza  or Kiwami at this point. was definitely the best in terms of alienating environments. But the game dragged a bit and it led back to an all Kamurocho focused Yakuza . Really wish they would have gone in more of an adventurous direction. The only real problem on this end is the limitations of Japan itself. For the story to make sense and still be Yakuza focused you can only go where Japanese is spoken. And the reason this game resonates so well is because the developers are living in the culture theyre making a game about. If Sega made a Yakuzalike game based in Beijing Moscow or New Delhi it would be from the perspective of outsiders. All of that being said there are way more places in Japan to explore that could be included. Heck they could just go to another part of Tokyo and that would be enough....Anyway my ideal Yakuza game right now is a ss based one. If youve ever seen the five part film series Battles Without Honor and Humanity its all about the formation of the Yakuza postWorld War II as Japan rises from the rubble and becomes an economic powerhouse. Directed by the same guy who did Battle Royale. Theres so much you could do with that concept in a game like this.,yakuzagames,df2a9bm,-1,t5_2xx8w
11263902,0,t3_60omyt,I played the demo of nier and own Yakuza. Personally I didnt really like the combat of nier but I only played a little bit. If youre a Mass effect fan Andromeda came out today and thats what Id buy if I had money Yakuza is story driven with very arcadey combat. Its all mostly button mashing imo. There are combos and dodging but its not that great imo Dont get me wrong though I do love Yakuza. So yeah idk get Yakuza for the story or nier for fast paced combat I guess. ,yakuzagames,df8qweu,1,t5_2xx8w
