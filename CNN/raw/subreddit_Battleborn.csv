Because its not genre its just subgenre invented by Rito Games to say hey we make DotAlike game but we want to not use dota to determine genre of our game because dota is rival for us.Multiplayer online battle arena? So why Battleborn cant be a MOBA? There is multiplayer there is online there is battle arena.One significant difference is creeps. Then Battleborn is Team Fortress  earning experience by killing monsters. And thats all. It doesnt make these two games uncomparable at all.

5599040,0,t1_cwqxx4h,Hence why the slow is a much better option Pheobe should be played as an assassin who ambush unsuspecting target. If you see her coming shes freaking easy to kill and kite but when she get the jump on you and stun you its almost a certain death if you do not have any escape. The slow help her land her stun and when she does she can deal alot of dmg without her target being able to do anything . I think shes in a good spot right now.

6075805,0,t1_cyfzuiz,Boldur was pretty sweet as well.  But man those incendiary grenades are sick!  And there are few things more satisfying than killing Pheobe by waiting till shes on you launching your airstrike at your feet camoing away and launching a grenade into the zone just to rub it in even more.  Its the equivalent of beating down an energy sword user in Halo  by armor locking as they lunge popping the EMP off the release to knock down their shield and killing them.

When you look at their takes on various other genres they have a tendency to cut extraneous mechanics to get to the core elements of what makes a genre tick and then build upon those. In some ways thats an incredible feat but there are often things lost in translation beyond the idiosyncratic reasons one might prefer League to HOtS MTG to hearthstone and so on. Im sure overwatch will be great but people should be looking elsewhere for games to draw comparison to.,Battleborn,d1r5wvd,2,t5_32hh3
7171920,0,t1_d1swvzx,gt ARTS is the general name of the genre though it is completely up to the dev to decide what they want it to be called.Not really. You game gets called whatever the internet thinks fits best. You can try to say multiple times your game is not a XY when the internet thinks XY describes you game well so be it.Just look at the genre walking simulator. No devs would call their games like this though it has become a very popular term to describe a certain type of game. Different genres just evolve out of the need. Thats how language works and thats fine. Fighting against that is just wasted energy to be honest.

There needs to be brackets that prevents people who are  or more levels above you from being put into your game. The amount of experience those people have compared to people fresh off the boat as well as the disparity in a well geared player vs. a greenhorn is gonna make this game really distasteful to newcomers.Its like if you started League of Legends for the first time and your group of freshfaced friends are all matched up with seasoned level s and all their runemastery pages.,Battleborn,d26urx4,9,t5_32hh3

7296559,0,t3_4fc76h,My favorite couch coop moment was Sunday morning on the ndtolast day of the beta. My girlfriend and I started the day off with some donuts and Battleborn. I was playing Miko and she was playing Montana. We were winning a game on Incursion and she noticed that she had  kills already. She was determined to get the Worthy of Song title get  kills in a single match and I was her helpful healer. She was competing for kills against the Marquis on our team also trying to get Worthy of Song that game.There were some really intense fights towards the end of the game. We had pushed down their first sentry and the second one was already taking hits. Time was running out and she was diving for kills and I was doing all I could to keep her alive. Every kill she would yell YES!! She was at  kills chasing down and enemy Thorn getting shot at by the sentry and other players and just barely missed it. She died and went on a  second respawn timer. At this point she was off the couch and sitting on the floor swearing like a sailor. But there was still time.Last  minutes of the game. She had just respawned and had a long walk to the front lines. This was it. At this point my girlfriend is standing on the couch. Here comes Thorn around the corner. Lumberjack Dash to stun Mansformation to knock up Hailstorm to slow and BOOM!  kills and Worthy of Song! There was actual cheering in my living room that morning. The Marquis got his  kills too so it was a winwin.TLDR  Sunday morning video games with the kind of cheesy cheering you see in E press conference videos.,Battleborn,d27khys,1,t5_32hh3

A solid flank in Counterstrike will almost always result in massive loss on your team. you dont experience this as much in higher TTK games which emphasizes gun play over ambush flank and positioning mechanics.

The more restrictions you put on matchmaking the better it will be but the longer it will take to get into a game.It seems like Gearbox is prioritizing faster matchmaking over higher quality matchmaking way too heavily in general.  I dont think premades getting matched against randoms is even the worst offender in this case.  The worst case by a mile in my opinion is them allowing games to start v.  Theyre so concerned that people dont want t wait for a match that they actually think a game thats v from the beginning is preferable to going back to matchmaking to look for a v.

Wave defense feels more like a chore and less like you are making any meaningful progress. It got to the point where Id walk into a large area see a bunch of buildables around and think to myself theres another wave defense objective ahead.Whats weird is the Prologue. The Prologue has cool little ingame cinematics scattered throughout engaging dialogue between Deande and Melka and most importantly it feels like you have a purpose find Deande and rescue her. Deande has an awesome little into cinematic akin to the ones in Borderlands  but you dont see that anywhere else in the game. Then after the mission we get treated to a handdrawn animation of our heroes escaping and thats it.It all seems so disjointed. The differences between the Prologue and the first mission the Algorithm are so stark its almost as if I were playing two different games. The Algorithm and every mission after it opens with the same generic sweeping shot of the Solus system with some kind of voice over. No handdrawn animations no ingame cinematics and the majority of the story is told via radio conversations between characters offscreen.All in all I was disappointed by the campaign.

7559086,0,t3_4iuvv4,I play her a little differently than you and get very good results. Couple notes I have gathered from playing  hours with her so far .  I never get the AoE blink dash unless for PvE. Double trouble is the only way for me.. there is too much AoE and splash damage in PvP and no real reason to get a  second AoE which locks her animation. The helix choice is pretty much only viable in PVE for me. Uppercut being probably the most OP helix on her it literally gives you the ability to stun lock people. I used to be a lifestealer and thought Uppercut was lame until I used it.. people just cant get away from you if you are locked onto them with this helix. Using her ulti while in stealth makes her lose stealth for me. I pretty much only use it after I have uppercut someone and they are in the air its almost much guaranteed landed unless they go around a corner. I personally stack attack speed for faster stun locks. I usually am running solo have a build with hps dmg  attack speed which works wonders for me. Only thing I can see switching would be CDR because Q is pretty much always on cooldown to get away if used offensively. Almost always go with the shield damage to burst dash. If you use this on your opening to an enemy with full shields it will pretty much fully deplete them. Really strong fighter at level  due to her Q. You can almost v anyone   get them low with no shields and then pop Q and they will die to the explosion. Ive had so many first bloods because of this.,Battleborn,d31fjr2,1,t5_32hh3

In my opinion they already provided  fully fleshed out characters all with unique personally and lore with the design of the character fitting the personally plus  more later down the round. So if they would of been like we are only doing color swaps for characters I would of been OK with that. Again they have been really upfront about this skin issues even before it launched.

Yeah it can make for some awesome bait and switch kills but as a support Reyna only picks up with helix traits that let her heal shields and health with overshield I find. Shes a good late game support but she has a really weak early game. She offers the worst lane sustain for her team as well because once someones shields go down and they start taking health damage she doesnt have anyway to heal them until much later in the game. Fairly bad news for eldrich characters.  and like I said her guns are just terrible. So she has the worst killing potential out of like everyone.

Heres Shortbeard and the Micro Avenger.Name The Micro Avenger and Shortbeard. Shortbeard is a midget humanoid who stands roughly two feet tall. The Micro Avenger is a scaled down version of a ragtag pirate ship equipped with antigravity thrusters. Shortbeard is a well renowned pirate who raids capital ships despite his own ship being a one hundred thousandth of the size and he only takes about a couple hundred pounds of treasure from those he raids. Considered a small timer Shortbeard has been trying to break into the big leagues and has even joined much larger raiding parties by taking a pittance of the total treasure. In a desperate attempt to gain notoriety Shortbeard attacked a Varelsi troop by himself. Sadly he was overwhelmed by their sheer numbers when Reyna and her Rogues stepped in to provide him with enough breathing room to pull out and escape. Once he was safely evacuated from the hot zone Shortbeard now owed Reyna a big favor. Reyna called in his favor by having him join the Battleborn under Ghalt with his ship and all.Role DefenderTankDisruptorWeapons Mini Cannons Shortbeards Micro Avenger fires barrages of bullets which deal  damage per cannon each second he has at least  of these onboard his ship.

Each cannon blast deals  damage and there are six cannons. Each cannon fires independently one right after the other.Ultimate Bombardment Shortbeard dials in his command console to activate rocket pods hidden on board the Micro Avenger. After five seconds of painting targets each rocket pods will fire up to six missiles at targets which Shortbeard has painted and deal  damage to each of the targets marked per missile. A total of  rockets are fired.Talent Emergency Shielding When the Micro Avengers health falls to  or below his shields are instantly recharged to  shield strength.

7635871,0,t3_4jwas8,My thoughts on building Boldur for IncursionCapture are hereFor gear I always run health regen because sometimes Im too far into the fray for a healer to keep me alive a Violent gauntlet which provides attack damage and  attack speed after landing a melee hit I also sometimes run the Vow of Vengeance Legendary which gives  attack damage  attack speed and  attack damage after landing a melee hit stacks ten times and attack speed. If youve played Krieg in Borderlands  you only need to learn a few more things to adjust to Boldurs playstyle Boulderdash how to retreat and when to retreat. Also being rather short and not having that tiny hand when youre a badass psycho.Boldur is an extremely aggressive melee tank. You can stick to an enemy team and deal some damage while your range and assassins can take care of healers and highpriority battleborn in the chaos. Hes a great team fighter and if you play your cards right he can pretty much v easily. Axe toss has two uses initiation and finishing. How you use axe toss will likely be affected by the mode you are playing. Incursion you want that axe toss with the slowing and making enemies take increased damage a mutation you gain at character rank  or so I believe. Combine that with Boldurs boost to movement speed without his axe and the ability to slow targets with bare fisted attacks and youve got solid initation and somewhat of a finisher for people on low health punching a tank or brawler typically wont result in a kill but a lot of squishes can easily die to punches. Axe throw is also one half of your escape. If your shield is getting pelted on thorw the axe and run. Prefferably throw the axe at the enemy especially if you have the slow on it so its harder for them to chase you. The other half of your escape is Boulderdash with the level  augmentation crash helmet. That overshield saves lives. If a melee character is up in your grill when you want to escape Boulderdash them away toss your axe at them and run.So how do you use Boulderdash effectively? Well allow me to tell you about a little mechanic that basically collision stunning which is that if a character is knocked into a wall with enough force they will be stunned. If they are knocked into another enemy character both of them will be stunned. You can use Boulderdash to slam Mikos into their healing targets to launch a minion into an enemy to stun them or to just toss somebody in a corner so you can have fun. You just need to get used to the dashs tinyasallhell hitbox. Also note that with Boldur one of the most satisfying things to do is come out of a shield stun from Galilea and then immediately shove her into a wall and quickly  her with your axe. You can also use Boldurdash to punish people who chase you by running around a corner turning around and knocking them away and potentially into a wall another one of my main ways to kill Galileas in capture as they tend to be overconfident and chase you anywhere. Boldurs passive however is what shines in team fights and lets him snowball. Rage is activated by killing an enemy any kind of enemy and grants increased movement speed and  damage reduction to all incoming attacks  if you get the mutation for level . The damage reduction basically lets you not worry about blocking for a bit and just go ham on whoever you need to. His utlimate Runes of Power basically has one rule have the runes active whenever you can. Healing from blocked attacks and increased melee damage are fantastic and RoP only has a  second cooldown as well as no timed expiration. The ultimate also increases Boldurdashs damage and gives the axe toss an explosion but also destroys the axe when it explodes. Its fun and youll just have to adapt to how you should balance using your ultimate and abilities from your own experience. The last thing to note is Boldurs quick melee. It has good damage almost as much as an unbuffed axe swing and crazy good knockback. I use it on Raths or other assassins trying to finish me off on sniper Battleborn to knock them into my team and to just lock thrall mercs into a corner or toss them over the edge. You may also die a few times in the early game as Boldur because a large portion of the enemy team focused you. Do not worry this is normal. Youll likely end up being a major component in getting a team wipe against them later as well as the temporary bonus that while those  Battleborn focused your lonely dwarf ass there were less of them to fight the larger portion of your team. Doesnt mean you should accept death instead of escaping but dont feel bad about getting focused hard.Overall Boldurs a fantastic character and I hope you enjoy him! Also kind of hope you dont because that means one more good Boldur to contend with online,Battleborn,d3a5mh6,3,t5_32hh3

7698680,0,t3_4kre8r,As creative as your ideas may be I think they are also bad ideas. I mean Galilea builds up corruption everytime shes attacking something so when shes not attacking something or hidingwaiting to jank someone shed be losing health slowly? Then what does that mean for her ranged ability? It renders it useless basically. Im guessing the idea youre promulgating is like that of Montana where overheating no longer causes him to stop shooting but zaps his health whenever he keeps on shooting. It wouldnt work for Galilea since one of her best attacks needs her at full health and many people easily counter her by having a shield penetration gear in their loadout.The idea of her corruption field sapping health from everyone including allies encourages friendly fire which is pretty bad imo. Why should an allys ability affect me unless its positive a la running through Marquis temporal distortion bubble?I do agree that instead of removing this or that they could just modify certain things in the manner you suggested. Now her Desecrates silence has been tweaked Im sure a lot of people will start calling for Raths silence to be taken away as well creating the negative feedback loop as suggested.,Battleborn,d3hafsn,1,t5_32hh3
7699056,0,t3_4kqymw,The true problem with Galilea is Gearbox cant decide what they want her to be. This last patch made her less effective for rushing but also less territorial.

7699899,0,t3_4kr67f,Ive never enjoyed PvP in just about any game Ive liked to date. Battleborn is unique somehow in making it fun enough and unique enough to jump that hurdle. Some of the things that drive me crazy about the experience Im pretty sure are related to pvp and not the game specifically quitting early exploits. Otherwise Im hopeful that this will have a long life of quirky badassery.I have noticed that the games are getting way more aggressive right out of the gate though.

She need to be a troublesome character that you know you cant take alone need to run and rely on your teammates thats her mark.

No it will never be on the depth of borderlands but it is a multiplayer game. Lets take the division for example you are only ever a generic soldier in an evolving story where as in  battleborn each character has commentary on your current story mission which is often humorous.

Second no character should be able to kill pretty much everyone on the other team with the push of a button. Using Raths ult takes very little skill. Everyone knows to knock enemies into the air and then ult into them. It quickly deals a ton of damage even if you manage to push him back or CC him. paired with the fact that it heals him very quickly it can stand to be toned down a little. ,Battleborn,d3jgbta,2,t5_32hh3

To which I say youre too biased on the topic and should not have a say in it whatsoever if you cannot see reason and the justification why so many complain about him. Also saying utterly stupid shit like oh you can just knock him away with your melee when he uses his ultimate is completely useless ignorant crap that doesnt work. Theres a distinct difference in whats said in the ingame chat and here on the subreddit. Theres a lot of very vocal people in matches that never take the time to post here because  as one guy said in the last match I played gt theres too many overly defensive people on the subreddit that cant stand their favorite characters nerfed so its pointless to try to get the game properly balancedTheres a select few here on the subreddit that understand what balance really is and will try to see it from someone elses side and Raths ultimate is by no stretch of the imagination remotely close to being it. You cant excuse excessive damage with its easy to cc his other damage is really low its easy to avoid.. when so much time spent facing him is when he sneaks up on you knocking you up in the air and spins under you while you just bounce COMPLETELY UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT until you die.Im suggesting restructuring him to the point of that no longer being a worry where youd rather be more careful to begin with around him and dont have to just take your hands off the keyboarddrop the controller the second you get knocked up in the air by him.,Battleborn,d3jknqh,1,t5_32hh3

7752836,0,t3_4lhvzd,First off if people are talking shit to you in game mute them. Secondly all that matters is that you a play your role and b play the objective. Healersupport is a very unrewarding yet very important role to play. The key to playing a good healer is to understand your strengths and weaknesses can keep teammates alive have slow move speed low damage large crit spot etc have excellent awareness as to your teammates status and above all stay alive.Stay behind the front lines providing heals or CC. Also know who you can and cant heal. If your Montana dives the enemy team and stupidly attempts a v let him die. You cant outheal any characters DPS let alone  plus a sentry. If you go in front of the front line then you and the person youre trying to heal are overextended and youll both die. Instead heal the people running back from the front line after taking heavy damage. Maybe hide behind a big character and provide constant heals while they try to make a reasonable push to greatly increase their effective health pool. Drop a spore bombgeyserpriority target on overextended enemies to help your teammates make quick work of them. Chances are you just ran into some assholes. As long as you are providing support and are actively seeking out players to heal without feeding the enemy team youre doing better than most support players. ,Battleborn,d3nfu4n,5,t5_32hh3

Its rare for games to grow a fan base unless it has initial hype. The formula now is to have some idea of competitive play from the start and tweak as you go.  It has to be a design consideration prelaunch.  The unlocks and how it all works in battleborn looks like it would be totally a afterthought from scratch which is next to impossible the way the industry works.  Lastly its a MOBA and mobas dont rise from the ashes like some phoenix and pull people in after its been out for a month.  Initial hype would have been whats needed.

No stopping to collect shards or build turrets no minion clearing or pushing into a team fight in the middle and trying to outplay the other team just rushing the fastest path into the tunnel to drop the sentrys shield before anyone can react. Last Incursion game I played we spent the whole first few minutes of the match rooting Montana amp Alani out of the tunnel it was truly ridiculous how quickly they put damage on the sentry w just the two of them then when their strategy didnt work in the first  minutes Montana just quit the game. Ill hand it to the rest of them for not surrendering amp Alani for keeping it interesting trying to fight back underhanded but that was just some really cheap crap and this is the kind of stuff Im tired of seeing.,Battleborn,d3r1uxn,2,t5_32hh3

7788336,0,t3_4lzsxp,Plenty to cover lets see how we go.Progression  You as a player level up via your Command Rank. You earn Command Points by completing Story missions PVP battles and various Challenges.  Your characters level up via their Character Rank. You earn Character Points in the same may as Command Points but only when using that particular character.  You earn Credits ingame in the same way as CommandCharacter Points. These Credits can be spent in numerous ways.Unlocks  Characters can be unlocked by reaching certain Command Ranks or by completing certain MissionsChallenges. By Command Rank  youll have everyone unlocked but its possible to unlock them all before then if you actively complete their unlock conditions.  Characters themselves have additional ability choices Helix Mutations  more on this later that are unlocked at Character Rank intervals.Gear  Gear is earned ingame via drops from bosses and pickups from some chests.  Gear can also be purchased outofgame via loot packs using credits earned ingame.  Gear varies in qualityrarity  better and rarer loot is harder to find ingame and costs more outofgame.  Any Gear youve accumulated is stored in a Gear Bank with a limited capacity of ish pieces but which can be increased using Credits.  Gear pieces have a Shard Cost more on this later attributed to them the better the gear the higher the cost.  Three pieces of Gear can be allocated to what the game terms a Loadout. Essentially a preselected set of Gear for you to use as required.Shards and Gear  Ingame  When starting a game you select a Character from those youve unlocked and a Loadout from those youve created using your accumulated Gear.  During play you can find golden Shards scattered around the map which can only be spent ingame.  Shards can be spent to build fixed turrets healing stations bigger minions traps and drones vary depending on map or mission.  Shards can also be spent to activate Gear from your selected Loadout. Once activated the Gear gives you its persistent benefit for the remainder of the missiongame.  This forces you to prioritise either your own effectiveness or teamobjective oriented boosts. Each has its own pros and cons.  It also means that cheaper Gear can be unlocked sooner than the highend Gear and allow you to build more Buildables to help the team  cheap but effective Gear has its place.Characters  Ingame  Characters have a primary attack a secondary attack or ability in some cases eg. Aim Down Sights a passive ability two active abilities and one Ultimate ability.  Each game your character will start at Level  and have access to all your attacksabilities except the Ultimate.  You gain experience for building turrets etc. killing minions killing enemies completing objectives healing allies and probably a number of other things that have slipped my mind.  Each level you gain up to  you can select one of two ability upgrades that improve or alter your playstyle. Example Oscar Mike can select between a longrange scope and a reddot sight at level . One improves his long range capability the other assists manoeuvrability in short and midrange fights.  The additional Helix Mutations you unlock via Character Rank provide third choices at some levels for extra flexibility.  At Level  you unlock your Ultimate ability for that game.  And once again you start each game at Level   so how you build your character over the course of a missionbattle can change each time you play.So thats probably the core of it. It seems like a lot on paper but you get a feel for it pretty quickly once you play.Missions and PVP games have varied objectives  capturing points defending points destroying enemy emplacements guiding minions to grinders  theres plenty of variety and you cant just go into a PVP game expecting to duke it out with other players and somehow win the game.PvP games are v and you can play with friend or just join a queue to be matched with other people.Story missions can be played alone or coop. The latter option can be local online with friends or online with random matchmaking.Theres also the option for Private PvP with you and as many bots per side as you want max v. This is an awesome feature if you want to fool around with new characters or get a feel for mapsmodes before playing true PvP.Im in Australia and havent run into any server issues. Had a moment last night with some lagging but I think the missus was downloading something and choking up the wifi.This really is a fantastic game with a number of ways to play. If youre in the mood to roll through some levels by yourself you can do so if you want to crucify some bots and pretend theyre your arsehole colleagues from work thats an option too or jump online and duke it out with and alongside other players.Some people have hit Command Rank  already Im just soldiering along casually at Command Rank  at the moment. You dont need to soak hundreds of hours in to get something out of Battleborn but you might find yourself doing just that once you get started.,Battleborn,d3rgryl,6,t5_32hh3

7788445,0,t3_4m0295,The beta had over  million players not only PC! yet we saw less than k owners on Steam after release with a peak of k players at most.a lot of people tried the game but only a few sticked with it. Blamed can be multiple reasons The performance. Almost all AMD users experience poor performance with fps below . No wonder they did not buy the game. A top priority thing to fix right now. The lack of tutorial. The second reason why most players did no stick with the game and this needs fixing immediately. They did not know how PvP works and complained about not doing damage not knowing why they lost and more. I still see a lot of high ranked players who dont know how the PvP modes work. The visual clutter. Paired with the lack of tutorial the visual clutter makes it hard to know whats going on. Only after a somewhat longer amount of time played you start to actually know whats going on in all those effects everywhere. The Overwatch release. Most people thought Battleborn is an Overwatch clone and still think to this day. To blame for that is not overwatch alone but also ks marketing. They even went head to head with Overwatch instead of making clear what their game does differently.  Mixed reviews. Based on the reasons above many reviewers gave the game only an above average score because they did no see the true potential and did not spent enough time in it. Only totalbiscuit did a proper impression on it with his beta video though he admited spending around h in it until he felt confident enough about it. He saw the games true potential unlike most reviewers out there. Its up to k to increase the playerbase from here on. Unfortunately they decided to go with a  off sale shortly after the games release which resulted in nothing really when you lookat the owner numbers on sites like steamDB. Doing that when the Overwatch hype is so dominant was a bad idea. Though I understand why they did it.It probably did not help though and just screamed desperation.My idea would be to implement a proper tutorial and sort out those damn performance problems then do a steam free weekend paired with a big sale in a few weeks when the overwatch hype has died out. ,Battleborn,d3rh7tg,41,t5_32hh3

7820685,0,t3_4me2c7,Why are people treating Overwatch like Lord Voldemort? Does a person quit playing Battleborn every time someone mentions The Game Which Must Not Be Named?Overwatch is a great game possibly one of the best released this year. At its peak WoW had over  million subscribers and within the span of a week Overwatch has hit  million players across all platforms. Im sure those numbers are probably a little inflated and Overwatch certainly isnt everyones cup of tea but lets not be petulant Overwatch is a remarkable game. By my own admission Im a Blizzard fanboy however the outlook for Battleborn is bleak if its success hinges upon the failure of Overwatch.Im planning to buy Battleborn as soon as I can save up enough money but I played the open beta extensively. I had a lot of fun but Battleborn is going up against some insane competition. Overwatch of course is one competitor though the games are more different than they are similar but it also faces competition from Dota and LoL which basically dominate the MOBA genre not to mention Smite Paragon or even classic CODstyle shooters.To the best of my knowledge this game still lacks a tutorial someone fact check me. Battleborn NEEDS a tutorial it is an incredibly complex and nuanced game and can easily overwhelm new players. If no tutorial is introduced before the game goes on sale new players will likely buy the game and quit after getting stomped a couple times.Though PC Battleborn is currently fighting an uphill battle on several different fronts the console version seems to be doing very well so there is hope yet. If this games fate however is tied to the hype generated by Overwatchlet alone whether Overewatch succeeds or failsthen it is already doomed.,Battleborn,d3v3zj2,4,t5_32hh3

I usually try to identify where the my team is weaker right at hero selection and pick to compensate for it. Ive most often seen people underestimate the power of CC and of spamming the abilities  especially since CC is significantly stronger in BB than in other MOBAs.Also take the initiative  link up with a teammate with a stun ability or two between the two of you and sneak up on the bastards.

The value for having more effects per slot makes it that legendaries are expensive early game having  extra effect for activating  item while you still have  slots open means you can compare the cost of the effect with half that of an epic at max late game however there is just nothing to compare it with and that alone makes that the cost itself is more or less justified. Imagine you could only use epic gear and when you have a full build you can add  epic item at the cost of double the price that could be something to compare this too.as you said it does depend on how useful the legendary effect is for that situation.,Battleborn,d3zfzq3,1,t5_32hh3

But its an interesting option for trying new heroes in PvE where you dont know which helix to pick or the choices seem lackluster.

The games loaded with a ton of hero character customizations which is probably the games strongest asset imo. That being said I myself find the gameplay a little hollow after a while. I can play it for a short time before I want to find something else to do. Like I said different strokes. You may see it differently.

What do you mean by all your shit? I mean depending on gear level and stuff the outcome may always be different. Though the enemy Alani did have a fullstack of heal ready which most Alanis have when fullhealth which perfectly explains why she went back to full health with that one. You shouldve stayed on her as that basically was her advantage and you took it from her.When fighting Alani be sure to either do enough burst damage to kill her shortly while using CC or make sure she uses her heal at least once so she cant heal up anymore that easily.Pro tip Alanis tattoos glow shiny when shes fullstacked.,Battleborn,d42klid,6,t5_32hh3

Who wouldnt be upset after weeks of concern about the declining playerbase Gearbox updates us with their Micro transaction scheme. Seriously? Weve already paid for the game were still here playing after the lessthanstellar launch. And now you want us to pay real money for skinstaunts even though there is already an ingame currency that could have been used? Wheres the downside of using credits? People would be playing more matches to earn the coin to get those skins which would be great for everyone. Instead people can drop  and get that skintaunt then feel cheated when they queue up and it takes  minutes to get into a match where everyone else is going to be using those same skins? Im a huge fan of this game its my current goto game when I get a chance to play after work. But its updates like this one that are killing this game. TLDR  Microtransactions?

7942468,0,t1_d48sc1x,If you go ahead and assume youll only play  heroes and mainly focus on one area of the game this is a fair assumption since in that case the  slots will suffice however having access to a white in PvP can be extremely game changing.If you fail to see how having every character with full access to every skill choice and any permutation of gear isnt an advantage then there is no point arguing. It is the definition of an advantage. One person has access to everything while the other has access to less.If you argue that that advantage is insignificant or unimportant well then that is your opinion and I would agree under the following conditions. You play no more than  heroes and focus on primarily one game mode PvE or PvP. If this is not the game slots will become an issue as will loadouts. Montana and Isic need a different set of gear and at the end of the day a Montana oriented loaodut will do slightly better on Montana than a generic tank loadout.,Battleborn,d48t2vw,1,t5_32hh3

Some of her helix option are as crazy as orendi looking at you pillarstorm and overall i played her because of Tiny Tina.I recently mastered Alani because she has a cool concept of an Attacker healer hybrid. From the progression ISIC is the next one. I find him really strong even after his nerfs the slows are really crazy tbh.As my fifth character I main Mellka right now. Why? Because she is fucking annoying with her venom. I got really angry after dying to mellkas who did like  damage just with her poison so i had to play with her too and oh boy is she a waveclear monster. And for my for now last often played character Toby. His waveclear is also insane and you are often far away from the fights so you rarely die with him.

It just takes time to fix such issues as they had.The thing that killed Battleborn was the marketing. The game itself isnt the problem but everything around it.

Im talking about anywhere without more than half health.As soon as I dip towards  I look to see if I can get some shards and then teleport base.A person that has low health is very often more of a liability than help in a fight.

Just for me it seems like a lot of risk while riptide tends to be a quicker and more guaranteed heal even if its only a small amount not to mention most of the time youll probably be playing around your own riptide while sending geysers off away from you so its probably also a what helps me more kind of thing since she was much less dependant on teammates before.,Battleborn,d4jzpwg,3,t5_32hh3

8059116,0,t1_d4lpa38,Really you need to bait out her teleport. Phoebe is great at closing gaps but cant escape too well before level . Keep out of melee range and try not to get jumped by her. If you see her try to make sure you have minions or something on your side nearby. Orendi herself excels at burst damage and agility. She also excels at having a crit spot right at the height of phoebes melee attack. Jumping helps when dealing with any melee character as some of their swings will hit thin air unless they track you.On the other hand you could engage and just burn her down very easily. Either surprise her with a spiky pillar to the face or just spam your auto attacks from a safe distance. Whenif she does turn to engage you either dodge the teleport almost impossible or just her jump back ability that i forget the name of to keep your distance. And worst case link up with some teammates to take her down if necessary. ,Battleborn,d4lx5oc,1,t5_32hh3

8113226,0,t3_4qcljw,Sometimes it is better to take a step back so that you can regroup and push together teleporting back if you are low on health will instantly refill it. For now I take a look at what my next levels choices will be before heading back into the fray. As for the preset helix choices its a decent Idea but takes away the flexibility in game. Say your miko and  guy just dropped but you can still push if you switch to the other side of the helix. Or you forget that you went stealth mode with OM and his nades no longer explode on impact causing a miscalculation and wasting a shot. The best way for me to play new Heroes is in private vs mode on meltdown so that its a quick match. The AI is absolutely the worst teammates imaginable and can be rage inducing standing around the shockturret for  minutes just because  guy died But makes for quick matches for tests since its only  pts to win. But I imagine if they can make default skins and taunts then helixdefaults could arrive. nEDIT Theres currently too much time before a match maybe make the helix options visible and preselect while waiting instead of spamming taunts. ,Battleborn,d4s0098,1,t5_32hh3

8150363,0,t3_4qu0w6,I wonder if Multiple Queues would work for Battleborn?You could even incentivize people who Queue All by giving them a gear pack or boosted Exp over people who queue for only one or two modes.Like boosting rewards for Tanks in WoW encourages their participation to finish up incomplete parties and get the games moving.Maybe thats a tech hurdle I dont know.EDIT jythri in another thread that was proposing something similarThis is a good idea. Id love to do it. It is however not a just do it feature. Given the way our tech is currently structured this is a bit of an effort and not something we can enable quickly or easily.If youve ever worked in software development you might begin to understand that there are many many things that seem simple but arent. Some things are even simple in one project or implementation but nigh impossible in others. Some decisions we make early rule out easy access to other decisions later. Thats some of whats going on here.That said this idea or several like it are things we are evaluating for longerterm matchmaking improvements. Were looking at both shortterm things we can try like the currently reconfiguration of queues and longer things that give us more options for configuration.Thanks for the suggestion though!

The matchmaking is based on a players winloss record. So if you jump into the game as a brand new player and win your first PVP game youll likely be matched up against some quality players for your second game. Lose that one and your next game should see you up against players with a rough  split. The more games you play the more data the game has to draw from and the more accurate your matchmaking should be.Im at CR or so and Ive got a WL record around .

Youre investing  shards thats  shards you could have spent on buildables instead. Lets compare your green one to my free one.Free one   shards . shards a second negligable downside Heal power or Reload SpeedYours  Shards . shards a second  buildable cost IF YOUR SHIELD IS DEPLETED.So lets compare. Every single super minion you build you will save  shards. We both make . shards a second so you can discount that.You are in essense paying  shards to save  shards per super minion. Which means you have to build NINE to break even with me. Lets not discount the fact that I can activate it immediately when the game starts and you have to wait.Why do you not think this is utter garbage? Just get a free one. Im not debating whether or not buildable or shard gens are bad Im saying nonfree ones are bad. PS You can see a list of the gear on  .

Its either the rd or th swing cant recall pretty sure its th in an autoattack melee combo which means its fairly tricky to land. And because its part of a melee combo it means Deande is moving very slow while attacking with it and she has a slow base move speed to begin with. I build attack speed with a move speed buff attached then move speed every time I play her specifically to address the deficiencies on her melee attack combo.If youre getting wrecked by it you probably need to control your engagement zone a little better. Just flee immediately when shes on you then dump ranged damage onto her and you should be okay. Like seriously if I catch two uppercuts in one engagement it generally means Ive either shoved someone in a corner so kudos to me or that person foolishly tried to fight back instead of fleeing.

It may be that is on purpose and it could be that the crit rate on that does stack with either the mag daemon or the stable executioner or it could be that works the same as a second chance. I agree its interesting on whether its worth running over straight attack damage or attack speed. Another interesting character to try would be Melka to see if her poison crits with this. I think Issac could probably single handedly take out a sentry. If you back door pop the reflector shield ult and go to work. I would imagine the rate of fire on Isaacs ult which normally doesnt crit i think would do insane damage with  crit chance  crit damage. ,Battleborn,d5hsv8p,1,t5_32hh3

Theres a big really big after this sale lol discord voice chat for AusNZOceania players if youd like company in story mode or to join up for some pvp   or the steam group that is basically just a portal to it tbh  Prime time has typically been like pm NZ time to midnight or am. Outside those times has historically been pretty dead in pvp matchmaking but between the patch and sale Ive been getting plenty of matches outside them lately hoping itll last.If youre interested in trying PvP Id say its a good time to start atm theres a lot of new players around and the high level players are policing ourselves and each other about not being pricks to the new folks. I think we all know that if theres too much pub stomping itll drive the newbies away and well end up with just the routine inhouse matches of the last fortnight which got a little stale.For supports I think about it as being shield v hp focused mobile v territorial and steady v burst. So miko is a mobile pure hp support that focuses on sustaining people whereas Ambra is their less mobile alternative but with better damage and surprising amounts of minion clear and Alani is a hp healer thats mobile and all about the burst healing. Reyna is a mobile burst shield focused support. Kleese is very territorial with getting his rifts set up but if the opponents dont dig him out he can do ridiculous amounts of damage and healing to make up for the long setup time and lack of mobility.Long post over have a video about Kiwi deck cleaners   ,Battleborn,d5nmxto,2,t5_32hh3

8438232,0,t3_4v7q04,The biggest problem is that the CC effect they chose .s Silence is just insufficient and barely noticeable. Either it needs to be longer or it needs to be something else. If knockback is off the table then slow knockup or even a blind would be much more useful without being broken even at the current duration or less.Personally Id be happy with a knockup that only triggers on max charge. With a fast hitting melee character like him that can make all the difference.,Battleborn,d5wbgu1,2,t5_32hh3
8438351,0,t3_4v8d8p,Not per se but in the light of team comp it may matter somewhat depending on the character. Two identical attackers will be completely fine though you might get in each others way as will two defenderstanks if potentially slow or lacking in overall damage but you wont be dying much. Two identical supports tend to be somewhat redundant or at least not as useful as two different ones and may hurt the team DpS. So if you really want to play a certain character in a round dont worry about a duplicate too much though triplicates and up of anything other than selfsufficient attackers tend to get messy but at least be aware of a wellrounded team comp especially for Advanced and some of the tougher missions. Meaning you dont necessarily have to follow it but at least dont be ignorant about it.,Battleborn,d5wc02q,2,t5_32hh3

8465179,0,t3_4v1r1m,Well FWIW Ill post my Pendles thoughts here. Overall hes a lot of fun. I like how he nearly has permastealth. It is pretty cool to be skulking around in the enemys back lines destroying turrets stealing shards and just generally being a nuisance. I also love securing kills on people who are trying to retreat I feel a little guilty but it is still hilarious. I think they did a good job in the balance department as Pendles has a hard time going v with anyone so you cant just destroy everyone willynilly. He is an amazing  to any fight though and again is wicked at securing kills from people who have been weakened off. Id say the biggest issue with him is keeping up with xp. I dont like to spend too much time in lane with him as he is squishy and his schtick is to attack at unexpected times from unexpected angles. So if Im visible in lane they know where I am and I dont want them to know where I am. However against a good team it can be hard to find those ganking opportunities so that just makes it hard to get the xp to lvl up. Ive been building him with movement speed atk speed and cc duration since he has so much natural cc duration figured Id boost it. Im no pro enough to say that gear is the best and everyone should use it but Ive been happy enough with the results for my purposes. It is amazing to get stunned or slowed as Pendles and see how quickly it wears off. ,Battleborn,d5zonlp,2,t5_32hh3

8482013,0,t1_d61sk7m,I usually kill Ambra with Pendles. But theres a lot of variability to it based on player skill. Its also based on their decisions. I get back stab damage and the extra second of slow so if Ambra turns away then I get a good  damage on her within a couple of seconds. Obviously team assists are a part of it very few fights are entirely solitary and I always anticipate that my allies will help down a target thats been extreme slowed and sent to less than half HP. I also imagine Pendles gets away with more on console than on PC even if its only a small difference it takes them longer to turn around. ,Battleborn,d61snv9,2,t5_32hh3

Often with the intent to capture secondary objectives and help team mates in any lane fight off more powerful opponents. In Battleborn it would imply stealing the enemies shards claiming any structures you can and capturing minion camps to boostyour offensive.

Sometimes it feels like you need to dash out of danger when really you might try dashing into the enemy and knocking them on their asses instead. Then just run. The dash mutation is legit.Also if you can get lucky with some legendary items he becomes a god. Hes the only character I run with  legendaries. I like using his lore legendary oath of the sustainedsong of vigor and plasmite transducersymbiotic gauntlet. if you take the helix option for heat regen  helix option to take damage for firing while overheating use regen gear and his lore legendary you can fire for a really really long time before stopping. Also I noticed that if you hurt yourself while shooting overheated it still makes the plasmite transducer give you shards. with a pocket Miko you can literally just sit there and shoot for minutes straight gaining shards.In the early levels dont rush out.

You can also die faster in BB there is no brush to hide in to juke people also no jungle and most ranged characters have unlimited range because of the first person style of the game so pushing up and being together is much harder unless you get a pick.I think having more space between objectives more worthwhile neutral objectives and some kind of brush system could do wonders for getting teamfights going.,Battleborn,d6to642,3,t5_32hh3

PVP on PC is bad and by the time you unlock half the characters youd be burned out. Console PVP is okay. So yes they are easy to unlock by playing the game but there is a chance you will get burned out by playing the game and wont even care about unlocking them.Gearbox locking the characters was a dumb idea.

8754328,0,t3_4zwaor,Unless Im mistaken most of the DPS boost is only translated to your primary attack therefore characters that do most of their damage from skills benefit significantly less from attack mode than other characters. Characters like Orendi and Thorn for instance who deal high damage from skills but not basic attacks  or in thorns case her attack speed isnt modifiable  benefit far less from attack mode than others do. Similarly for your supports the dps increase isnt substancial either way. So it might be best to just keep them alive with the damage reduction if the egg space isnt shared with multiple others. I do agree the attack mode seems to have more overall utility though but its not as clearcut as that. Its not as unbalanced between the two modes as the OP suggests. ,Battleborn,d6zy5u4,1,t5_32hh3

OKAY NOW THAT IS OUT OF THE WAY When matched with evenly skilled it can be more intense then both of the other modes because when grouped right its all about holding down them points but also having a flanker capture unoccupied points and also be skilled enough to v almost anyone to hold that point. Yes in a way capture is a good portion of killing but the capture points thats where the real game is. Too many times have I won against unbalanced teams where we had  to there  kills and still won by a landslide because they didnt capture points. A even better game is when the game ends with  hands down my best experiences in this game and I have had maybe twice that happen in incursion it happens almost weekly on neck to neck capture matches. Another thing I feel like its a true test to skill against other players on the capture battlefield no minions to hide behind or a base on your backside to run to always and very little help from buildables if your smart you go with a wrench and shard gen and build like crazy. Hands down I love capture I have close  wins in the mode Ill always play it haha. But seriously I can talk more about it but i dont have time at the  moment I may post more later.Edit. TextEdit. Chaos Rumble mode Ill need to try out I only got incursion matches on rumble yesterday go figure.Edit. More to sayThe currency in the maps could us a small and I mean super small increase. Maybe make all the small shards tier  I thinks thats like  or so. Dominating the map can overwhelming for people that dont play capture much but I feel like to many people dont have a stragedy when it comes to a good team. I think some better tutorials about the mode would help some examples I dont think people know. Ie. Always be on point when capturing so to gain a boost of experience both when you take a point from the enemy and when you take it for your team thats almost a whole level. You gain xp every sec you stand on your points. Big shards and minions spawn at  min things like that. Rushing to a point at the beginning seems to be a stragedy for alot of teams which always ends with one team being destroyed when they should have been grabbing unoccupied points and gaining levels.Edit. I would like to see a more fortified larger monuments like map for capture with a  win score you would see alot allot of fixes that people have with it. More currency and varelise to gain levels and longer time to unbalance snowballing. You would have to increase the time maybe to min.,Battleborn,d72oyr7,0,t5_32hh3

8865120,0,t1_d7dg6b6,Quoting myselfgt Mix teams after they are matched... Stacked teams happen for two reasons Premades and the matchmaking system.I acknowledged that premades would still be an issue but since most games are not  man premades with CR s a majority of games would see major improvements. You could leave premades together and still mix the teams up in most cases. Thats all they need to do. If they wanted to discourage premade pub stomping they could allow s between being matched mixing teams and starting to freely drop out and requeue. Players could avoid them if they wanted to. This would indirectly increase the wait timer for  man premades and discourage pub stomping. They could also offer additional rewards for beating a  man if youre the other team. Maybe a free loot box.Overall Im not sure if their system is really that complex and costly to implement mixing teams or if they just dont understand how much it would fix whats been dragging them down over the past  months. Maybe its a combination of the two. Either way its not getting done when its essential that it does.,Battleborn,d7dgoa9,1,t5_32hh3

Often times I get top player and bot damage with least deaths by playing him.Throw owls in minion lanes then bubble the owl right before minions get there. You get  sources of AoE damage plus they get slowed and stay in there longerGo for shepherds as the spawn. The crits are easy so they can sometimes be burst down before they can shield anything useful. Go for all the buildables they buy as you can usually shoot it from outside turret range. Burst down other bots as needed but dont prioritize the small bots as your skills and team mates are much better at taking them downGo for large targets like Montana and kleese. You will completely shut them down as long as an enemy like melka isnt putting pressure on you. Whenever your ult comes off cool down go for those long range hail Mary shots on minion waves.

8952667,0,t3_52wx0t,I love monuments especially as Pendles or someone with an escape from the midlane. But there are  things that make me frustrated with it.  Waaaaaay to easy to cheese the sentry. Any ranged character can do it from too many points. Ranged in general have a much bigger advantage on this map. No mid turret makes the lane kind of boring in the center.  Id like to see something like a turret in an alcove like on Coldsnap or Outskirts. Even a stinger would be acceptable there. The healing station might as well not exist. Its in a spot that provides no meaningful help to your team if youre at it and is easily accessible to the enemy in a spot sheltered from your second sentry after they destroy your first sentry. Theres absolutely no point in using it over just teleporting back to base.Edit Forgot to say what I like. Open areas and multiple pathways allow for different tactics other than Push Get pushed Push Get pushed until one team gets lucky.Second sentry is harder to get to than first. First sentry is dangerous to anyone not behind their minions.Verticality adds some really interesting features and gameplay even if it does allow ranged characters to wreck shit.,Battleborn,d7nz6ob,14,t5_32hh3

Other times Ive run smack dab into aoe slows and sniper fire and have quickly become a walking kill count. So I think he has potential to be op played by the best skilled players. Same with most battleborn including rath and formerly attikus. Melee players know best how much skirmish tactics and knowing when to pick a fight and when to disengage from one are essential to playing these characters. Some however dont seen that the damage they can do is the buff they get for being able to engage from only a limited range. Ranged battleborn will always have a placement advantage over the melee battleborn making it necessary to have them have a burst damage ability in close to even that fight up.,Battleborn,d8h6v7u,1,t5_32hh3

Yes she still has insane burst and the arrow buff may have made her overall better in that regard but in return she lost her godly wave clear capability. To me what made Thorn an S tier wasnt just her burst and agility but the fact that blight was so strong as a wave clear and disrupting tool that she was essentially a jack of all trades. with the blight nerf shes lost a huge factor towards what made her so good at basically everything. Sure she can still  several characters with ease but now that she cant also hold down an entire lane single handedly with a blight field while simultaneously murdering everything with a curse  volley  ult combo drops her down from an S tier to a solid A in my book.Completely agree on Boldur though.,Battleborn,d93rf7u,3,t5_32hh3

9474760,0,t3_5ajttd,The first part of your post is a complaint that they nerf overpowered characters. Benedict is in a much better place now than before now that they removed his ability to have an infinite mag and his ability to crit. Ernest is a fat annoyance with a massive crit spot that is stupid easy to kill if you have a gun or attack him while he reloads. Kleese is also fodder for range characters and if you are walking into his rift network thats entirely on you. I agree that Tobys  second stun is OP but he has to put himself in a bad spot in order to land it and has one of the largest crit zones in the game even Mellka can land consistent crits. Toby relies entirely on having his safe space to dominate. Harass him and keep his shield down to make him have a bad time. Galilea is a frontliner and relies on the enemy fearing her or playing dumb. If the enemy bites back she can be shut down fairly easily. They also buffed a helix no one ever picked which isnt a character buff but rather rounds out a character and makes their helix more interesting. Its funny how every time someone says they are tired of playing the same teams the comp changes. And its also funny how I never actually see those comps. Agreed on Pendles being worthless though. I hate it when a teammate chooses Pendles because they are only useful if the game is going well. Otherwise they make it a v because they never attempt to attack waves and only ever break stealth to get the last hit on someone. Not uncommon for me to outlevel a friendly Pendles by  or  levels.  ,Battleborn,d9gyvqi,12,t5_32hh3

Thats why a  stack of Oceania players going to play in US queues at times means you play on Australian servers rather than US ones esp if one of the opposing players is also from OceaniaAsia.At which point the US players typically complain a lot about lag tbh even though thats what we always have to deal with if we jump across the Pacific to get quick queues.

10292098,0,t1_dca3raw,Its not so much complaining as much as it is bringing light to what is referred to as Pubstompers. These people or teams like to get into easy matches and completely steamroll a team of low levels or people who are not as skilled as them and going out of there way to farm kills and such without really ever focusing on objective. This and the fact that most of these pubstompers when face with a real challenge often run and hide because steamrolling low levels outside of the bounds of what is necessary teaches everybody nothing. Its perfectly fine to steamroll a team within the bounds of the game because your better but to go out of your way to do it for a longer time then necessary is pretty pathetic. My team has faced plenty of premades that often say  Were just having some fun tonight so were left because they just want to pubstomp and not face the reality a better team exist and there not as good as they think they are. I want people like these Pubstompers to scrim us and to see how it feels to get steamrolled game after game. Trust me it wont be like the games there use to where they drag it out killing and farming just for FUN.

The monetization and metagame features may not be part of the gameplay but its still attached to it and affects how we enjoy Street Fighter.

Theyve got a fantastic game on their hands regardless. Just wanted to throw out a quick suggestion but I dont think of it as a priority issue. The ops point idea is pretty cool though!

Ive always thought Narrow Margins is a particularly odd one in that it rewards you for almost losing and you need to actively have your team in a bad position to get it. Itd make a little more sense if it was just win after losing your first sentry rather than winning after your second sentry goes to a quarter health. So Close So Far is a similar one in that it rewards you for killing minions that almost got through although Im also sitting at  so I wouldnt be surprised if its bugged so again you need to be in a bad spot to do it when youd obviously rather kill them earlier,Battleborn,de31uok,3,t5_32hh3

11059606,0,t1_deldjc1,Phew reading my post again I think I was a bit too onenote with negative criticism and overlooked that I think theorycrafting like this both specifically and in general does a lot of good for the game as the devs try to read all of this stuff and it probably affects changes down the road. Glad you didnt take it badly.Regarding his shield I think its most useful in its current form to protect yourself from longrange crits from people like OM or whiskey and to block high damage skills like orendis pillars and thorns ult. The latter use does take some practice but with higher sensitivities it should become second nature. Recognizing audiovisual cues goes a long way in reacting to these quickly. Relatedly some of those skills you mentioned can and should be blocked e.g. stealth strikes impact damage explosive charge and the original explosion form an OM grenade. I guess I worry that somehow having a shield that can stay up would make it less useful as an ondemand tool but if it still acted as a gate protecting your health from things like thorns ult then I dont know what would be wrong with it. In terms of his shield Id be all for an increase or trade between his shield and healthpools but sadly I dont know if theyd go for it considering how comparatively useful shields are. Its interesting to hear you say that you feel toby and isic already play too similarly as in my mind they share some cosmetic similarities but their playstyles are very distinct. Toby has a directional static shield that does more to enhance his own damage than block or reflect sustained attacks he needs to bunker down far back in the lane and is most useful when hes destroying the minion wave with piercing projectiles while holding his stun to deter frontal attackers meanwhile Isic is most useful trolling the enemys buildables from hard to reach places letting his wards reflect stinger bullets and thumper rockets and ganking melees who should have no recourse for him. I think both characters fundamentally dont function well as primary tanks as they both are best positioned away from the enemy team and have punishing critspots when theyre exposed and cced.For your last point I cant comment much on anything opposite reflective wards as Id take them over any other option without fail. They are so essential to his kits functionality that I almost think they should be available on overcharged wards by default especially because theyre an option after only a single levelup. If they added that property as a default than yeah Id be open to playing with his wards as another aoe damage tool and testing out weird upclose builds but as it is now they are crucial to what makes him viable. Anyway no worries about feeling like you were longwinded I cant seem to help but write too much anytime I comment on things like this and I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your reply. ,Battleborn,dell6x2,2,t5_32hh3

Thats largely because it made it more team oriented and harder to carry which isnt ideal when youre solo queueing andor your teammates dont communicate.  The Finale is fun when it goes more than the initial wave and both teams get ultra minons but Ive only actually had that happen twice so far. Unfortunately the Finale also punished uncoordinated andor shorthanded teams even further. Those changes were probably good for competitive play but Im not a fan for casual play.My biggest issue with Meltdown isnt the mode itself its that whenever it wins the vote it seems like nobody actually knows how to play it or they simply dont care about the objective.

11331761,0,t3_61pzom,Yeah I feel like if youre in a man with voice chat and youve played with them a lot so youre a coordinated team you would be expecting to crush teams of randoms. And in my experience when some people dont like the surrender option its usually when theyre stomping and they dont like not getting to continue stomping. But hey if someone doesnt wanna sit and get stomped because no one in their team can work together just bad mouth and call them names I guess. Like I dunno ya sit in the queue for a long time just to get in a game but then the team comp is bad and no one can work together and everyone is just dying constantly its not a fun time when it keeps ending up like that. And to have to sit through it until the enemy team gets your second sentry? That could be extra time youre waiting in the queue for. Anyways most streamers Ive come across that stream Battleborn are nice about that and understand they have a great advantage from the start but not all.

I say Montanas is balanced because its easier to counter and oh let me go in detail on that since you still leave out crucial things...gtMinion waves hurt now ya know a lot.Speaking of minion waves you know Orendi crushes them and is typically a level or two ahead of everyone for that reason? She gets to her brokeass final helix level far earlier than the other characters get to their balanced final helix level. Neat. gtSentry can also feed into it. I just gave you examples of how montanna can soak damage without being shot you saw them and covered your eyes apparently.Sure sentry can feed into it but do ya know how to stop that? Both the minion waves AND the sentry attacks and the hilariously lame AoE that is supposedly such a threat? RUN AWAY AND RETURN FIVE SECONDS LATER! When he gets to the final seconds of his ultimate  the last two or three  DISPERSE! Even if he tries to dash he cant nuke the team no matter the damage! Then you can return in less than four seconds making a full recovery if you arent mentally impairedunfortunately for you...!gtseen it happen. post mortemNever seen it happen. Asked my friends got the same answer. I guess PC players can be dumber than I thought thought it makes sense because theres only the best and the worst left playing so the former exploit the latter to hell.gtLevel  boldurdash helix for damage was actually broken for how much bonus damage it added so yeah its not a small damage buff its actually huge.Even WITHOUT the damage buff it has crazy damage. gtWhy do you keep comparing boldur and montanna when all ive been saying is Montanna has a really deadly nuke in his hands that if more people were aware of they would complain about it? How long was Boldur really powerful before people were made aware and THEN they complained?BECAUSE ITS A THREAD ABOUT BOLDUR YOU NITWIT?!?!!!?!? WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MONTANA IN A THREAD ABOUT BOLDUR?!?!?! Jesus CHRIST! And wtf does it matter if it took a while for people to complain about Boldur if hes been OP all along? They ended up buffing him a while ago and THAT pissed people off getting more to recognize how insane he was!gtYour best quote! You can also try jumping. When playing against boldurs its like theyre in slow motion can see the dash coming a mile off.Which a Boldur should be able to look out for. Doesnt require much brainpower to think hm they might jump or try to move perhaps I should catch them while slowed or when theyre landing!gtNot suggesting montanna is better than boldur at all ive been a boldur main since tech alpha and know he wrecks people.Then youd know how much worse he is than Montana and how Montanas nuke is balanced compared to his controversial aspects and its balanced on its own.gtYeah that makes you look like a grade A fucking idiot who shouldnt be complaining about balance let smarter people use the right arguments yeah?Too bad you make of a fool of yourself every goddamn time you open your mouth in a thread related to Boldurs balance. Whos the idiot now tarbrain?gtAre you saying they fixed montanas post mortem explosion? Or that youve never seen it happen therefore it doesnt exist?No dude for real they fixed it. It was patched. I remember Montana killing me postmortem with it the first time I learned of its existence then I began to actually use my eyes to watch out for it and I remember showing a friend how it worked he wanted to know if it worked postdeath too so I tested it on him in a private match. gtPillarstorms okay in organized games at least.Ah yes with the  other good PC players. Organized games are a helluva lot different from pubs both with friends and solo you dolt. I even doubt its okay in organized games . Most people ban orendi in private and public draft matches or honorban her. . Half the reason she was banned was Pillarstorm. Thing is Montanas ultimate only does  damage if.... Activating Mansformation at level ten is a prerequisite which is on a second cooldown. Granted the cooldown can be lowered but like I say gear is another can of worms.. Your team focuses him. Which should not be happening if hes at level  in Mansformation.. He steps into Minion Wave and Sentry lineofsight allowing him to absorb damage. At that point its obvious what hes trying so you should try to stun or slow him. Even if he uses dash with extra distance if hes slowed he wont go very far. Say Montana has soaked up  damage somehow even though its typically half or less than half of that. Hes ready to kill you. Now what?. Stun him or heavy slow him yet again to demobilize him.. Expect a dash if you cant slow or stun him. In that case take cover or at least scatter a little bit. There is no way in hell he can kill all of you if you are separate. Dont bunch up like morons. oh but if were separate wont the enemy team push or take advantage of that? They might but chill out you can counterpush with numerous other tools or you can not worry about that at all since youll be split up for three to five seconds. Woop de doo dah three seconds if you cant get back together after that its on you. One of you must have ran right into a spot vulnerable to the enemy or something. ,Battleborn,dg4ro7b,1,t5_32hh3

11650781,0,t1_dgfyi0r,gt Using WASD for FPS has been the standard since the s though.Well that depends on who you ask. In  Goldeneye  was released. For a lot of players even some that started on PC that was their first FPS and analog stick player movement was their standard.Old standards often stick around because people are stubborn and resistant to change not because they are the best option. I think WASD falls under that category. There are other movement solutions out there and a good developer will try to be as open as possible to supporting them especially when it means giving better access to players with disabilities. Robust remapping is the first step.I bring this up due to personal experience. I used WASD for years until it started amplifying existing pain in my left wrist. It was one of the reasons I switched to console play. When I came back to PC I wanted a hybrid so I figured out how to set up analog movement  mouse.Having used that in competitive FPS for about  years now I find it far superior to any keyboard movement. WASD requires a lot of key feathering to get movement outside of eight directions but analog sticks allow thousands of varying angles with just a slightly different tilt. Because of this analog movement becomes a secondary mode of fine aim allowing one to slightly nudge to the left or right to line up a shot. Its also terribly comfortable if you can find the right hardware.I do think WASD allows for faster strafe jukes as three fingers can strike opposing directions faster than a thumb can tilt. That would probably make it superior for acrobatic FPS with bunnyhop such as Quake but thats about the only advantage I can see.Valve has made pretty big strides their Steam Controller Configurator now allowing most any Xinputbased device to be remapped. At this point for Steam games without a ton of hotkey requirements Id rather use a device that reports as an Xbox controller over USB. It opens up more versatility as the Steam hook will allow an Xinput device to send controller signals  simulated keystrokes  simulated mouse all at once.I often wonder why Valve hasnt released a Steam keyboard with a builtin haptic touchpad and perhaps even pressuresensitive keys which reports to Steam like a Steam controller and can be fully remapped and chorded. That would certainly solve the problem with games like Battleborn with their subpar remapping options.I think its also important to note that if and when VR becomes affordable to all perhaps a decade or so if were all still around WASD will likely go the way of the Dodo.,Battleborn,dggmp0b,2,t5_32hh3
