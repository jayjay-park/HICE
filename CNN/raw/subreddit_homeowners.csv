40364,0,t3_1uh0h3, Questions. Is your house brick. I am assuming yes based on year location and the problem. Solution  None. Happened every winter and your house will go through the freeze thaw until its just too old. Are there noticeable cracks on corners of walls or passages throughout. Assuming I am right with the brick question Are they orientated diagonally? If you draw an arrow on the bottom of the crack it will tell you which side of your house is settling. If you have it on multiple directions it means its a specific corner or two sides equallySource Civil Engineer  Home Inspector in Training,homeowners,cej0yk5,1,t5_2r9c1
99822,0,t3_1v89c7,Purely speculation based on recent weather but Im guessing an ice dam has formed on your eaves.  When that happens the water is forced inside.  This small stain indicates a potentially huge amount of water in the attic.My advice is to pop a small hole like pencilsized or smaller in the center of that stain ASAP to drain the water out into a bucket.  Then youll need to find the source.,homeowners,cepsmvx,9,t5_2r9c1

387227,0,t3_1yio1v,no one here will have the answer for you. you have to look into your contract and contact your bank. asking the lawyer who closed with you on the house isnt a bad idea either. could shoot his paralegal or whoever you were in contact with most an email and ask if its in the contract somewhere. sometimes they will consult on things like that for free.if you had a good loan officer they should have presented different options for you at the time you applied for a loan and again when you were given good faith estimates. it depends on if youre a first time home buyer what tax bracket youre in how much you make etc but typically there are programs and different loans besides the traditional  down and FHA some of these include an option to pay down the mortgage insurance or remove it early with some circumstances.the likelihood is though if you are doing an FHA loan you dont and legally shouldnt have the money on hand to pay off your mortgage insurance or put down enough money to where mortgage insurance isnt necessary  or more. also Im not sure you can even do it at this point. the contract likely states it cannot be paid down early and cannot be removed until  of the value of the house is paid or a combination where the insurance youve paid  the amount youve paid  also the mortgage insurance is not to protect you its to protect the bank. unless you purchased your own buyers insurance which hopefully you didnt. basically mortgage insurance is there because right now you are a risk to the bank. you havent put down the traditional  of the value of the house youve put down . at least which means the bank virtually foot the entire bill. they paid everything in hopes you will pay it all off plus interest over the course of however many years. in the event something happens to you and you cant pay them they lose out. it is a risky investment for them. so basically you pay extra money to the bank in addition to mortgage and interest which isnt applied to the loan or value of the house. its extra money they pocket to build profit in the loan and make it less of a risk to them.,homeowners,cfkwh69,4,t5_2r9c1
446981,0,t1_cfr2zgg,Thanks. Cool. So although you found its nice to have it actually sounds like they were saying a dedicated dining room is not all that expected for a modern house. It is weird.

Family dinners several times a week! even though the dining room they have now is a mail sort room  days a year. Its almost the same thing that Ive seen on those house selling shows where prospective buyers are turned off from buying a house because they dont like the sellers couch but a little more grounded in reality.Yeah I saw some illconceived renovations too. Most had to do with maximizing living space while obliterating storage.

733269,0,t3_22gara,We moved into our first home last summer and had an issue with a mix of large and small leaves from locusts and cherry trees as well as larger bushesvines in the area and needles of various sized trees.  The gutters were getting hammered by everything including branches in the fall.  I headed to Home Depot and bought these covers that are similar to ihavespaghettis recommendation.  I went with these as I preferred the  sheetmetal material and hole size to keep little things from creeping in too much.  They were somewhat of a job to put in but once I got the hang of it and the right sizes it went pretty fast.  Seems to have done a great job so far!

833848,0,t3_23mjfx,appraisers licence here.  The comps are only  part of the value determination although it is usually the main factor that underwriters look at.  The others are a cost approach and an income approach usually not applicable for singlefamily homes.  The appraiser if he truly believes that he has an accurate value has several ways to explain that value to an underwriter usually in the form of addendums.  He might explain why certain comps were chosen or why he is tending more heavily towards a cost approach any number of reasons.  Asking for additional information on comps or even for additional comps themselves is very common.  Remember the underwriter is covering the ass of the lender and is the last line of defense against a bad loan.  The appraiser is the eyes of the underwriter as they are the ones actually looking at the house and doing the work to determine a value.  i wouldnt sweat it too much this is quite common.  The underwriter is likely wanting to make absolutely sure that they have enough information from the comps to support the value.  Any appraiser worth their salt will be able to justify in writing why and how they arrived at a value  they have to they are often reviewed and penalties for not doing so can range from fines to suspension.  Remember too that even if you did not order the appraisal if the lender did for example they are required by law to provide you with a copy at least in most states so ask to see if you havent already.  Hopefully everything turns out fine for you in the end if you have a reputable appraiser at all they should be able to work out things with the underwriter.  ,homeowners,cgz276l,3,t5_2r9c1

If youre going to start replacing galvanized piping and you can afford it it often makes sense to do it all in one go rather than over time. Those pipes are under pressure so any problems can multiply It has been a long time since galvanized piping has been standard... those pipes may be reaching the end of their expected lifespan. Corroded pipes could lead to stained water If youre going to do a mixture of piping galvanized and brass do not go well together... make sure the plumber knows what hes doing if hes going to use that mixture.In the end though its a lot of money so up to you.Also I have no idea where you are or what typical rates are in your area.not your atty,homeowners,cmboqnj,2,t5_2r9c1

3557474,0,t3_311vei,Home Inspector here. Dont panic! Yes theres a lot of information thrown at you in the space of a few hours. No home inspector will expect you to grasp every bit of it the first time through.Do follow the inspector around so you see what heshe sees. Before they start tell them what your goals are for the house long termshort term? How much are you expecting to spend to do repairsupgrades immediately? If I have a client who tells me they have about K available for fixups and I spot that the house needs a new roof and a new furnace plus has a bad electrical panel I can tell them that they are probably facing nearly three times that in immediate expenses.A home inspection is meant to inform you about the big things. Focus on those rather than the little things. And there will probably be a LOT of little things leaky faucets broken tile damaged door hardware that are under  or so to repair and are easily DIY jobs. Its really the big ticket repairs that should be your main focus. Most inspection reports have a summary section where the major issues are outlined especially if they are safety hazards. This will help you focus on the most important items. If the inspector doesnt provide a summary in their report please ask them to write one up for you separately. It may take them a day or two but it will help you immensely.Also the inspector should be available to answer questions well after the inspection is over. We tell our clients that if they need us to clarify anything that is in the report they can call us even several years after the inspection is over. A good inspector knows that it is their job to educate the client about their new home.,homeowners,cpxrye8,6,t5_2r9c1

The rest of it drains for my sinktub water pipes that run to my units faucetstoilets are for my exclusive use so they are my responsibility to maintain.  The vent and main drain pipe are shared by all the units in the building so it falls back on the Association to maintain those items.YMMV and your documetns should delineate who is responsible for what.On a side note if this were me I would get my own plumber to check the damage out ASAP.  If this damage was something that clearly took longer than  months to cause I would tell the association that they need to pursue the old owners insurance for damages....or you can leave it be and have the association go through your insurance but you might be stuck for the deductible....heck you might let the Association know youll not argue with them over when it happened if they cover your deductible.,homeowners,ctzhqk6,4,t5_2r9c1

Im not sure how backfeeding a panel is going to kill anybody seeing as thats exactly what many solar installations and transfer switches effectively do.Yes ideally OP should buy a transfer switch a standby generator or have a professional install for a hookup for a handful of EUis in parallel or something similar but all of that would cost a small fortune.Describing oneself as poor and wanting a proper standby generator setup in the same sentence is not a compatible thing.

If they see one that is they can ONLY say to have it inspected by someone who is qualified with specialty knowledge to give you an actual evaluation of the problem. Thats not the people here on Reddit! I am a real estate agent and not an inspector but that bottom right crack appears to be separating which can also mean earth movement where a corner of the house is shifting due to ground slope.

8655387,0,t3_4yer56,To answer your question if the HOA is liable for damages the answer will depend on the HOA master deed and bylaws which governs damn near everything in a condominium association concerning your problem specifically it will most likely fall under something along the lines of Repairs. Now just to give you a heads up. I can already tell you you are definitely going to be in a very tough situation. First off I just want to clarify it sounds like you got a bad water shut off valve you need to replace it. Right? The problem is the main shut off which the HOAproperty management controls cant be shut off which is imperative for you to make your repairs sound about right? The bylaws specifically outline the Common Elements that the HOA are responsible and obligated to maintaining and Individual CoOwners Unit responsibility and obligations for maintaining. Now this is important because that will determine whos responsible for damage as a result. Now heres the thing usually for plumbing that line is drawn at that shut off valve you have leaking. Anything before that shut off valve and it would have been the HOA responsibility that shut off valve and any plumbing after is all the owners responsibility. Any damage as a result follows those same criteria generally. If this is the case then I regret to inform you though that would make you solely responsible for any damage solely based on the fact that its leaking specifically from a valve that falls under your responsibility for maintain. Believe me I understand the only reason you cant fix it now is because the HOA maintenance fucked up on their end because they cant shut the main shut off for you can get your repairs done but the simple fact is the water is leaking at your valve and not theirs. If you would have had a busted pipe before that shut of valve this would be a completely different story and the HOA would cover all damage and repairs.Heres the thing though you do have some options. I guarantee if you contact your local county housing authority and light a fire under you condominiums ass you will definitely get results.Secondly you do have the option of working through your own insurance agency to get the repairs you need done and then have the insurance agency attempt to subrogate partial cost of damage from the HOAs insurance policy. Subrogation basically means that your insurance company on your behalf will negotiate with the HOAs insurance company to try to reimburse you partially for the cost of repairs since they are partially liable. Keep in mind though you might want to contact your insurance company beforehand and well as the property management company for your condo first subrogation is the equivalent of sending a debt collector to your neighbors door and saying Hey bitch you us some money!,homeowners,d6njdy6,5,t5_2r9c1

Some are code nazis and will notice where work was obviously performed call the city code office and look for permit filings.  You can always plead the fifth in that it was like that when you bought the place.On older homes that have been through a few owners unpermitted work is just a fact of life.  LOTS of people do work on their homes unpermitted for lots of reasons.  Technically speaking youre supposed to get a permit when replacing a failed receptacle in your bathroom.  In reality no one is going to pay  or more to get a permit on a job that costs  in parts.Most localities are pretty forgiving when it comes to work done by previous owners since theres no way to tell when it was done or by whom.  If you really want to backfile a permit you usually can theyll send an inspector out and tell you what needs to be done.  No ones going to fine you or throw you in jail for not having it inspected or permitted kinda up to you on whether you want to do this.

If you arent painting the exterior you can get tinted caulk to match you trim. Go up in your attic and use fire block foam to fill every hole in every top plate around ceiling light boxes can lights etc. If you have a chimney it will require special treatment other than foam.

10859708,0,t1_ddjnwi5,F is not a maximum at the water heater.  In NYC that will rack you up many thousands of dollars in fines.  Water delivered to tenants must be a minimum of F meaning the water heating system must run hotter to overcome heat loss.  I believe the target temp is around F delivered to the fixtures.The proper temperature controls are always at the point of use.Infants young children and seniors are more vulnerable to scalding in a bath because they are placed into a bath without the ability to get out quickly.  Their complaints can also be ignored by caregivers who dont bother to test the water on their own skin.   Most older children and adults will test their own bathwater first andor have the strength and ability to remove themselves in a scalding bath.What educational materials do you have for tradesmen that instruct them to store water below F ?  Is it regional?  Most of what Ive read online is in the F range.There are no code restrictions on max temp of stored domestic hot water.  Its a myth created by people misinterpreting the warnings required on fixtures and water heaters.ASSE  or ASME A..CSA B. for shower and tub fixtures must have a limiter able to be set to F and be fieldadjustable.  Yes you can set it higher or lower as the homeowner.  They are adjustable because of seasonal variations in the incoming cold water temperature.  Winter water is colder so the limit stops must be adjusted higher or you end up with warm showers.  Summer water is hotter so you could end up above F at the point of use.Other code maximumsBidets FPublic hand washing FGang showers FDomestic water heater output without thermostatic mixer FTemp in a water heater varies F from coldest to hottest.  Its recommended that the return pipe is around F and the hottest temp is above F in order to kill bacteria.Legionnairres grows best between F.  So setting a water heater to max at F keeps the entire system at the best possible temperature range for maximum bacteria growth.Want to know more?  Read this guy.

Electric mowers will not work well on tall thick or wet grass.  They simply do not have the horsepower to do so. I dont know the weight of the units you are looking at but I would suspect a batterypowered electric is heavier.  A heavier mower is harder to use and will tire you out sooner. A mower with a cord is a hassle to use.  You have to dragthrow the cord out of the way a lot and it may not be long enough.As you may have guessed I tried electric once.  I had a tiny yard ... and I hated it.After trying a variety of gas ones I now own a Honda  If I had bought it the first time I would have saved a ton of money and headaches as well as backaches.It has a plastic deck which is lightweight and wont rust has dual blades and leaves virtually no mess I cant believe how well this works and is selfpropelled so I am not exhausted when I am done.I bought this as my th law mower.  Electric first but it would not work if the grass was at all wet and I cut through two extension cords so I gave up after a year.  Then a cheap  gas one which lasted only two seasons.  Then I got serious and bought a gas  Cub Cadet which was guaranteed to start ... which was then impossible to start after the first yearFinally I got the Honda in .  It has started on the first pull every time is easy to use and only takes two pulls to start it the first time after sitting all winter no gas in tank.  Get the Honda and call it a day.,homeowners,dfvvvc9,10,t5_2r9c1

If theres no other headstone they may have used the plaque as a headstone.You should proceed under the assumption that there are a couple guys buried there.,homeowners,dg4cs9z,7,t5_2r9c1

11584242,0,t3_65apr1,Id ask some neighbors. Get on Nextdoor if its active for your area and ask there. Generally youll be looking for a really good handyman. And call out more than one for estimates. Get it in writing.  You can source the railing if you want. Contractors have different opinions about it. Its less money cant mark it up. But then they dont have to run around. The smart ones will just mark up the labor a little bit.  ,homeowners,dg92x32,5,t5_2r9c1
11591788,0,t1_dg9wvo6,I would think you could. I could but I have knowingly smelled the difference.Diesel smells just like a diesel pickup or a semi truck exhaust. It also has an oil feeling to it. Gas is pretty refined and clean like rubbing alcohol. A little diesel in a gas engine wont do anything. A little gas in a diesel engine could fuck stuff up. Diesel fuel is kind weird  you could pour it on a match and it would put it out. Do that with gas and it will blow up in your face.Also  if it has a color or dark toned it could be premixed oil and gas for a chainsaw weedeater etc.I assume you want to keep the can right? If not just call in to the police. Say it looks sketchy as fuck and that you are worried. Theyll pick it up for you.,homeowners,dg9xrah,1,t5_2r9c1
