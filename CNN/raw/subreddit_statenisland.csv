120905,0,t3_1vgwd6,There are absolutely no safety issues for you to worry about at allthe problem is that its not easy to get around from that hotel particularly to other places on staten island. The hotel does offer a free shuttle that will take you to the ferry so that is  what you should look into for getting tofrom manhattan. Just know that youre not going to have a typical nyc vacation experienceyoure pretty much in a suburb. There are certainly things to do on staten island Snug Harbor for one and lots of amazing restaurants but be prepared for a bit of a commute going into manhattan and coming back to the hotel. ,statenisland,ces75s2,14,t5_2rh1q

Its only going to get worse once the poorly designed Mount Monresa townhouses are fully established causing massive traffic jams at Narrow Road North junction at the Verrozano Bridge exit. Thats another thing that pisses me off about Staten Island. Poorly thought out urban developments with no considerations for parkings and personal spaces. Just look how poorly thought out the planning is. Driveways right next to each others with no ways to park on the side street. Even Google Map cant fit into this side street here at a townhouse behind the mall. So......poorly.....designed.....,statenisland,cujmq0l,2,t5_2rh1q
