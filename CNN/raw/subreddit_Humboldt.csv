2413382,0,t3_2n18vv,Several of the most wonderful coffee shops you could imagine have gone under in ArcataEureka because  months out of the year theres about half as many people in town. Theyre either students who have left for the summerwinter breaks or theyre locals who went up the mountain or left town for the sun when the summer on Humboldt Bay was just gray and cold every day.  Coffee on rd Street The Daily Grind across from Arcata city hall and Muddy Waters Coffee Company which has been closed or sold to a half dozen different owners in the last  years all went out of business because cost of business was higher than the money that came in. Muddys was across the pedestrian bridge from HSU.  Coffee was in Old Town Eureka. Daily Grind was a block off the Plaza in Arcata and none of them were economically viable.,Humboldt,cma04bv,2,t5_2qshu

2748595,0,t3_2rgdax,Ive been interested in this solely as means to buy coffee. When you expand beyond that to many items or many people I believe you start to encounter overhead problems. A few thoughts I hadWho stores the food until its picked up by members? Does managing the cooperative get you a better share?How is damageloss dealt with and who manages reimbursements from vendors?

4471748,0,t1_csu66ly,gt  love the obvious distinction between the people who are telling me thats its worthless to move there and how everywhere is saying its literally some of the most perfect conditions to grow in in the US.Thats not how this works. The people telling you youre being idealistic arent growers who feel threatened by your type and want to protect their cash crop theyre people who have seen plenty of  year old kids come to Humboldt chase this idea of making a living off of weed figure out what the real world is like and then end up homeless and living on the plaza somewhere moving back to Southern California or in a few cases dead in the woods in Sohum. ,Humboldt,csuc58s,3,t5_2qshu

7498075,0,t3_4hxsmw,If renting try to find a private landlord rather than one of the property management firms. If youre looking to buy consider living outside the major population centers. k is honestly a fairly flexible budget and of youre patient you can find something good. My wife and I paid k for our house here in Loleta and aside from one minor incident with the rental across the street its been great. Nice and quiet with good neighbors and a community that looks out for each other. It seems to me like you guys are just kind of bouncing around all willynilly so you should take some time and do some real research on different areas and actually get out there boots on the ground style and see whats available and where. ,Humboldt,d2uhqg1,2,t5_2qshu
