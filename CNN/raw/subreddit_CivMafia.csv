We win on day five if we avoid two more lynches and dont miss another kill.Two more lynches is a rather big ask though given the game setup. If we can get through today maybe uMarioaddict should claim an investigator result on someone? Killing Whovian night  will leave us with  members and only  townies that can vote if he doesnt steal from one of us. So wed only need to convince one other townie to vote with us.,CivMafia,cxuh9me,2,t5_3b4xk
