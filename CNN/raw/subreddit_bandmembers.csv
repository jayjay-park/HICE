We pander to them play the kinds of music that gets played at weddings give cards etc. We get a fair amount of work when their friends decide to get married too and hire that band that they all remember. We also play music at a bridal show once a year that fetches several more jobs. We also get organic traffic to our website which has been up for  years and has a page loaded with text about us being a wedding band for this particular area.

Theyre glad to be a part of it because your work is getting them gigs and an opportunity to record. Its a privilege so they dont expect pay. But your drummer he probably puts in more than he gets out. He could choose to instead dedicate that time to playing in or recording for other bands for more money with more talented band mates.The fact that hes the exception doesnt make him wrong. It just emphasises how every band and every band member is a rule unto themselves and both you and he have to decide how much this continued working relationship is worth to you.If I were in your situation Id try talking to him and making it clear that nobody else gets paid. Id like to hear what he would say to justify a special case payment for him.

5573088,0,t3_3resus,The best ways Ive found is to make jibberish in terms of syllables. It definitely helps to know scales which isnt only practice for being in tune but you should be able to use a scale to be spontaneous with melody. Kind of like scatting the melody instinctively with syllable placeholder notes. If you dont play any instruments pick up the basics on guitar. If the band can show you the chords you will find melody in that way can be mutually beneficial.,bandmembers,cwnw5vq,2,t5_2sgov

10046064,0,t1_dbgpqxu,Hey thanks for the well thought out response appreciate it. Honestly its probably some combination of timingstudio gearengineer chops haha. Ill be the first to admit that my timing is not metronomic but I record to a click and I think that while not perfect my drum tracks generally have character and sound good the producer dudes did comment that the mics and room sounded great. I agree with you on the cohesive performance part. There wasnt really an opportunity for us to lay down a base track together before we overdubbed so it would be hard to have a good tight performance from all of us just playing over my tracks. If anything thats probably the best case for sampled drums here.I do think Im going to suggest that we record elsewhere in the future. While I appreciate the guys helping us I feel like theyre commandeering our record to make it sound how they want it to sound rather than sounding like... well our band.But yeah I am far from perfect as a drummer so I understand the producers wanting the tracks to be tighter. I guess I would rather get there through practice etc. rather than having the music overproduced like I feel is happening now. Ill talk with the guys though.

10664254,0,t3_5sli6n,Youve got loads on of options.        First of all the laziest way you could salvage it is just to get your new singer to sing an octave lower than the female singer. This will sound a bit weird but its easy. You could even leave the female singers voice in at the chorus but mix it as backing vocals.       Another option is to keep your composition but to start the recording again. While this might seem a lot of work IMO its the best option if you care a lot about this version of the song and dont want to record it a second time in the future.        Another option is to get your vocalist to sing a different melody over your already recording. Probably not what Id recommend   And finally you could chose to keep this version of the track with the singer whos leaving. Have it as a keepsake and dont dub vocals of the new singer until you do a new recording. You can always do an updated version later on down the road. It really depends on what reason you are recoridng your songs. If its just to show what you can do for venues  its probably not going to kill anyone by keeping the old singer on the record.,bandmembers,ddfxpxq,11,t5_2sgov

I know in a good singer but Im always going to feel like an acceptableatbest guitarist so I feel like I need to watch and make sure Im not fucking up.I havent gotten complaints for a while now and thats going to probably depend a bit in what kind of music youre playing. If youre playing really energetic rock yeah its a bit weird. Were lucky in that we okay weird acoustic shit and dress a bit odd so its almost an anything goes situation.Basically if you can try and think about it both ways if you could perform differently or more energetic what would you want that to look like?
