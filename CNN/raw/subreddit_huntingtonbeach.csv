10268414,0,t1_dc2k74w,Carlos was really good to me. I used to work in IT and found myself without a job way too often. He always gave me a huge discount when I was between contracts.  Sandro was very cool as well and I gave him plenty of free tech support. They called me Gregorio and always made me feel like family.In the late s I moved to downtown and on July th we were not allowed to drive cars or even ride bikes after the couch burning and general melee of  Crazy times. My neighbors always blamed the trouble on ers. HaHa!I really miss downtown and used to walk down to the pier to watch people and the sunset almost everyday. So looking forward to moving back and riding down to the wedge.,huntingtonbeach,dc7zbop,2,t5_2sgfq
