4480241,0,t1_csvdzu9,It is a new font. I actually had to replace the old one as it didnt like the letters F and L together. But Im quite happy with the style this one gives.The colour themes will be staying CJ suggested the gradient looked quite retro but I think it works.Ill look at the text box. I do agree but its hard to make it less cluttered and have everything fit. Any suggestions?Thanks for the feedback.,NeonSanctum,csvehad,1,t5_39054
