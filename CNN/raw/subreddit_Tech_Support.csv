8127831,0,t1_d4rlynd,Thanks! Had a bit of a struggle trying to figure out how to boot into Safe Mode Advanced Startup tools didnt have anything nor did pressing FFF. We ended up using gparted to scan the hard drive running memtest and eventually opening it. There was a blue speck of dust ? on the connector of one of the RAM chips we removed that and presto it seems to be working again.,Tech_Support,d4tn41v,1,t5_2qjxi
