My dog is white so it also helped me make sure I chose a food without ingredients that can stain the fur around her mouth like beets.Which food are you using if I may ask?? its funny how concerned I am about my poochs diet when I dont even eat that healthy..... ,fosterdogs,chnpb0t,2,t5_30hxh

After that slowly introduce them. Put them on equal ground probably both on leashes at first. Let them know everything is okay. You are the alpha and in charge. It will take time. Just keep working at it. ,fosterdogs,cma75lt,2,t5_30hxh
