1824288,0,t1_ck9061f,st off let me say that I dont care if they raise minimum wage or not.  They arent going to raise it enough to suit the people wanting a raise and its not going to significantly improve anyones life.  However its not going to significantly hurt anyone either.I think the real issue is that people who are working minimum wage jobs be it now or after the minimum wage is raised are working on the low end of the totem pole.  These jobs are not meant to be lifetime jobs or jobs to raise a family of four.  These are entry level jobs for people who are just now entering the job market.  You work at McDonalds for a few months or a year until you decide that you want to become a manager or until you find more gainful employment.If you find yourself working at McDonalds for  or  years or longer and are still making minimum wage then minimum wage is not your problem.  You have failed to launch.  You have failed to make the most of your time to improve yourself in a marketable way.  Its sad but its true.  McDonalds or any other minimum wage job is not supposed to be the end goal but the beginning....the first step not the last step.,LittleRock,ck90m05,9,t5_2sj2s

Routers could be produced to share data without risk. They could be used to produce a city wide independent self organized network which could share bandwidth. If wifi does not have the capability then lifi could be used. If individuals would demand routers easily set up for a private wifi network and a public encrypted data sharing network the days of bandwidth limitations would be over. All it would take would be the writing of a protocol to be adhered to by manufacturers and the purchase of these routers by the public. It would begin to produce results as soon as two of these routers were within reach of each other and would be cumulative as more joined in.
