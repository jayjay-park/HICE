3257975,0,t3_2xevwi,Eat more protien.Have you looked at the  Week RASP Training Plan You dont need any of that lifting and you arent doing nearly enough cardio. As soon as your ankle heals you should really find a program that has running swimming rucks and calisthenics. Many of the programs on the side bar meet those requirements. In my opinion you should scrap your entire current workout and build a new one from the ground up. Your program should include the following Calisthenics PushupPullupSitup x a week Running  times a week Swimming  times a week Core workouts Plank bridges supermans birddogs etc  times per week Rucking at least every other week. You want to be aiming for bare minimum  optimally  on your PushSitPull scores and  lt lt on your TwoFive Mile runsI wouldnt even add any sort of weighted training until you could hit those numbers. If you do hit those or you are absolutely unbudging on lifting id add in some compound movements at weights where they wont interfere with your running.  Note This is only my opinion YMMV,TacticalAthlete,cozp817,4,t5_374ws
3426002,0,t1_cpirxyl,It can supposedly help to stopprevent muscle cramps. With how cheap and easy it is to get I figure might as well incorporate it.  if you are interested ,TacticalAthlete,cpisflr,1,t5_374ws

4472196,0,t1_csudmi2,Yea. Throw in a  miler once a week mainly for the mental aspect. After youve been running for awhile you can bang out  miles and walk it off like nothing happened. A  miler will at least leave you tight the next day. Also you probably have the endurance to not really even get tired until mile ish so itll help you to deal with actual boredom as well. Just shift your mileage around a bit. Run  miles a week with a  miler thrown in along with some intervals and youll be good. The problem with running  miles a day is you get really good at running  miles and not necessarily any faster for the k type stuff which is what you want. If you run a competitive k that means you still have the speed to bang out a  mile along with the endurance to make it  miles at a slower pace and not be goo. Id look up a competitive k plan and do that and switch to a competitive k plan  to  months out to lean back towards the endurance side. As long as you throw in a race pace mile to check your progress you shouldnt lose too much of your speed.,TacticalAthlete,csue61x,2,t5_374ws

8685439,0,t1_d6raeh0,I think having WODs made by graduates would be a good daily thread as some insight into what to expect. I think something created by graduates to help incoming candidates would grab more attention and keep the sub a little more lively. It would add to the community aspect if we all posted times bitches and gripes whatever you want to call it too. Not trying to turn this into rCrossfit but overcoming challenges together does help foster that team mentality.Food for thought.,TacticalAthlete,d6rb180,5,t5_374ws

10575314,0,t3_5rauzn,BJJ might be a good thing also getting your ass kicked by people smaller than you older than you and more out of shape plus people that are in even better shape than you is humbling and at times trying. Plus you learn BJJ which is a plus in its self.,TacticalAthlete,dd6redp,1,t5_374ws
