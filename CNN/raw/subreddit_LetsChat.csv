The drawer labels are masking tape and were made by one of my predecessors.  One or two of them Ive moved from drawers elsewhere in the shop when I moved their contents.  I went overboard on the blurring the top right label only reads Tools.  The others are identifying enough to make watches and tubas clearly what they are.Id also mentioned that my computer box lived in the legspace of the desk and that I had killed one by catching my foot on a cord and knocking it off the shelf it sits after which I put in a couple scraps of wood to prevent that.  You can see my work in another angle  The keyboard tray is there too.There was also mention of a workbench and storage made for my van by the finger carpenter.

Later the full part of the discussion was more like this quote which is from the bookgtIn the moment when I truly understand my enemy understand him well enough to defeat him then in that very moment I also love him. I think its impossible to really understand somebody what they want what they believe and not love them the way they love themselves. And then in that very moment when I love them   gtYou beat them. For a moment she was not afraid of his understanding.  gtNo you dont understand. I destroy them. I make it impossible for them to ever hurt me again. I grind them and grind them until they dont exist.

Well that and I feel there is a clear ... falsenessjoking sense in the goadingthe audience can see his face and the fact that his gibes can rile her the way they do shows how much she cares.  What if you could apply this to watches tubas and mounts with them as the goader and you as the goadee?Obviously they dont know you but they bring out the expertise youve built up by the time you meet them so in a way they show your knowledge even if they dont have a knowledge of you. They could be seen as trying to get you to do something that is good for you keeping everything as much as possible in good working order and possibly learning new solutions along the way. There could be a falseness in their goading they arent trying to be obstinate its just that it takes a hardtofix object to help you discover some new technique or approach. The fact that you can get upset at them shows how much you careabout your work and what the miners and mine customers need. In the end there is a resolution. The object when fixed makes peace with you by now quietly going about doing what its supposed to do.

Being a dork I Googled how to be happy. One of the articles returned said if you dont open yourself up to being hurt youll miss a lot of chances to be happy.But theres also a point when you have to realistically evaluate your relationship and determine whether youre happy. If not and there are no better options the relationship has negative value and is keeping you from starting a better relationship.So...that wasnt a very good good morning post even if its at night.

2867186,0,t1_cntwryw,Okay. I guess I should be open about how I feel about the breakage of SDinTD feelings too.  It seems like weve mentioned the fact that there is a selfish part in me that would like changes about honoring that I dont encourage.  That same part would like the continuation of the SDinTD feelings.  Even  my honorable self is ... hurt? disappointed?  feels a loss? ... by the fact that Ive been and done and said things that have led to the breakage.  There is a worry that it damages the draw and reduces the wish for the SLs weve spoken of.  Theres even the selfish part that would hope that after you recovered from the terrible things that would have to happen for it to be so you would want an SD if those things did happen and the sense that the breakage might preclude that.  There is no hoping for terrible things quite the contrary my selfish part is selfish not evil.All I can say is that I feel like Ive sought out connections in person and formed them as strongly as I have leading to my sadness in part because I would never ask for or wishhope for any changes in TL that would make SD possible.  I said in the course of our talking about the CiI that I was scared I could lose two friends that I valued highly because of it.  I was half right on that Ive lost one friend for the time being.

Of course some have more things in common with me than others. Gender is a strong identifier as is never harming anyone and is seeking to do good while taking chances and having adventures. A female character who overcomes difficulties for a good cause without hurting people is likely a strong match for my sense of identifying with someone.  In some ways though Id say I identify more with the resolution of the crisis than with any one character. I feel like I live my life more in intention to turn difficulties into successes than I do in the limitation of who I am if that make sense.

What my excellent cheddar cant seem to locate a memory of is whether or not you would prefer to know the results before the story or if you want to find out with the story.Are you sitting down? I want to make sure you dont hurt yourself if you faint from this surprise.  What I prefer most is   However you best like to share it! Heres the deal which you know already. First and foremost its all about you. You are the best part of the whole thing with the race today and with everything on our branch.  Next is that I love your words. I think you are a consummate storyteller and you have my rapt attention with just a Hi .  So if you are writing it and its being written the way you would like to tell the story thats my first choice.  However within that is what youd like to receive right now. If you won and would love to have company in celebrating it or if you had a hard turn and would like some company in bearing it and want to tell me for those reasons Id absolutely want to know the result first so that I could be for and with you all the things you need that I can possibly give on our branch.  If I didnt know you and the race report were in a book that I was reading and we didnt have our branch I would want to know the result at the end.  I do know you and we do have our branch and you are my priority though so if there is anything about me knowing the result that would make your night better tonight Id want to know the result now.  Actually now that Ive typed all this out because I am so close to you and we are so connected and we like to share with each other my sense is to say that knowing the result now is the most sharing and matching and closetoinperson thing there is.  With all of that the choice is still yours. I want you to choose what best feels like a fit for you.  ,LetsChat,ctomxir,2,t5_2utlb

5133135,0,t1_cv4hjy2,Oh I know.  Ill give you a thumbnail race report!I rode through some moderately heavy rain on the way to Vallejo so I ended up spreading all my stuff out on the covered deck areal of the club so it could drip without making a puddle to be cleaned but wasnt balled up in my trunk.  The boat was rigged and ready by the time I got there so we chatted for a bit and watch the wind be fairly light one moment and then have a burst of rain and wind come through.  Initial thoughts were for the biggest headsail but we revised it to the second biggest by the time we hoisted.Lady Crew is volunteering to help with Lake County refugees so we were short by one but a Bearded Person who joined us last week came by and decided to join us and do LCs work.  He did well overall especially considering that he wasnt familiar with the boat. Since it was rainstorm weather the wind was almost straight up the river meaning that we were against the wind on the first leg which is unusual.  We got a good start and became the leading boat fairly quickly.  We were never passed even when some of the faster boats nearly caught up to us at the farthest point in the race the buoy marking the middle support of the Carquinez bridge.  We had a better course to that buoy and made some of the distance back before rounding it.  The trip back upriver was against the current but with the wind so it was spinnaker time.  We got going nicely and things looked good but the topping lift portion of the bridle broke  It was the part that connected to the end of the pole that gave way and the tip fell down making the trimming not work properly.  After a bit Bearded Person found a bit of line I could use to make a temporary fix.  I fumbled about way too long but did eventually get the fix made.  We never lost our position and crossed the line well ahead of any other boat.  It wasnt enough though.  Little fast corrected out about thirty seconds ahead of us.  That makes two first places and one second.  We need to beat LF next week if we want to win this month.  I think LF has won the year in aggregate months already.  Okay Im going to get the last little bit of prep done and hit the road.  Ill be back to say  til later in a little while,LetsChat,cv4qg10,2,t5_2utlb
