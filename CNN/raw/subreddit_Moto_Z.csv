8977444,0,t3_538dkx,The Moto Z Force is a Verizon exclusive in the US. There will be no GSM unlocked verison in the US.As for a international GSM unlocked Moto Z Force for the rest of the world a lot of signs disappointingly point to no rest of world Moto Z Force.And when it comes to Verizon exclusivity does not always end. The Droid Turbo  was a Verizon exclusive in the US and never had a US GSM unlocked verison only an international Moto X Force. Same with the Droid Turbo although there was a minor exception that there was a non Verizon branded Quark in the US for regional CDMA carriers but still no GSM unlocked model for the US only for select international regions.,Moto_Z,d7qyaqu,2,t5_3endu

Its possible some software conflict may be causing this.,Moto_Z,df5e9if,1,t5_3endu
11248975,0,t1_df6d20d,I do that as well but then it takes even longer for the mod to charge. I only charge them together when plugging in.I think Moto is going to release a battery mod that can turbocharge which would be nice.,Moto_Z,df71zf9,1,t5_3endu
11280524,0,t3_60xcvw,I went from Moto X Pure   to Moto Z play. I dont know if issues with Bluetooth were too widespread on the Moto x pure but my phone would sporadically have connection issues when connection to Bluetooth speaker or to Bluetooth in cars.My Moto Z play has worked flawlessly with Bluetooth. Plus the battery life is amazing. ,Moto_Z,dfampzy,2,t5_3endu
11282646,0,t1_df9p97j,I have Tasker installed but I dont believe I have any conditions which are causing this  I have a wifi off while connected to car Bluetooth but looking at the logs its firing when it should. I disabled Tasker anyway lets see.I dont have a wifi scanner installed. I have the Xfinity wifi app but I disabled that also a few days ago.,Moto_Z,dfavdgr,1,t5_3endu
11304112,0,t3_61bwwk,Ive noticed battery has actually improved over marshmallow. On M Id usually get around . hours sit on WiFig with  percent battery drain overnight.Now on N can get around  hours of sot with WiFi and g with  percent drain overnight. This thing just keeps going and going.This is all with gamingdemanding tasks no babying the phone  Edit this is obviously the z play btw,Moto_Z,dfdayp3,8,t5_3endu
11335212,0,t1_dfglryw,Thats disappointing to hear I just updated to Nougat last night and was excited to see how much of a battery improvement there would be with the new version of Doze,Moto_Z,dfgtri0,0,t5_3endu
11335545,0,t1_dfgv2ck,Thats what I was doing tonight just wanted to make sure it wasnt a wide spread issue ,Moto_Z,dfgv4dx,1,t5_3endu
11474789,0,t1_dfwndju,Its kind of annoying that the first thing people on here suggest is nuking the phone. What that says is they really dont have a clue about the issue they are commenting on. ,Moto_Z,dfwnvbo,2,t5_3endu
11479219,0,t1_dfx5wy4,I find it more han acceptable. More importantly it adjusts to whatever we angle you have the camera at unlike many projectors I have used. Love it!,Moto_Z,dfx5zja,1,t5_3endu
11499257,0,t3_63smg9,In the morning I get up and start charging my MZP. Make coffee take a shower and remove the charger. That is all the charging I need for the entire day.,Moto_Z,dfzfvdy,2,t5_3endu
11516234,0,t3_63gwxy,For those still looking for a solution to this bug the solution I found was to make the album art size less than x resolution. I was using high resolution album arts and I guess the phone couldnt handle it. I think this is an issue with the Moto Z because my last phone the Droid Maxx  and my tablet the Nexus  didnt have any issue displaying the album art. ,Moto_Z,dg1d7iz,1,t5_3endu
11615657,0,t3_65r2j1,Its not bad its just pretty good. I mean  hours is kind of the norm for other phones it seems so Id say  is nice. My Z Play under normal use can get up to  or  hours but its literally the best battery life on the market right now. So Id say  hours is fine nothing bad and nothing super special.,Moto_Z,dgcn88f,2,t5_3endu
11622665,0,t3_65ucen,Rescues animations can make the device feel faster. ,Moto_Z,dgdfut5,2,t5_3endu
11640506,0,t3_66428t,I bought a Huawei P and all in all im way more pleased with it than with the Moto Z Play BUT. BUT. The battery life sucks sooooo sooo much compared to the Z Play at first I felt like i had made a huge mistake but naw. I do like the P more but battery life certainly is important and thats a point where Huawei is a disappointment. Which is weird because its not a small battery  mAh compared to Z Plays ? but it lasts me half as long as the z play.,Moto_Z,dgfgqp8,5,t5_3endu
11733592,0,t3_67cn6c,awful battery performance... a bunch of spoiled posts in this subreddit!,Moto_Z,dgq16k4,1,t5_3endu
11739569,0,t1_dgqlz4x,Thanks will have a look at those. I went looking for Cyanogemod which  I last used to root something only to find it gone. So Im woefully out of date.,Moto_Z,dgqpknd,2,t5_3endu
