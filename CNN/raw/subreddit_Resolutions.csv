115867,0,t1_cermewq,I live with my best friend I cried on his shoulder today as it was a rough day... I dont really have other friends and its his mom that has cancer so we are both leaning on each other. We have good moments but a lot of the moments are sad. Our apartment is really gloomy right now. We went out for lunch today and for frozen ice cream tonight watched Community which made us laugh.  There is always some happy moments. Just too many sad ones. But I think slowly it will get better.... I hope...,Resolutions,cermhvq,1,t5_2rf8k
