9727062,0,t1_dac2clx,Hey Wizkid! There are two reasons why the subreddit has moved. The first is that we think the name is more intuitive and will lead to better long term growth of the subreddit. The second is that there is a completely new moderator team. If you have any other questions let me know! Edit To further clarify one of the things we like about the name is that it is more inclusive to newer Janna players who dont necessarily main her. Some of the other champion mains subreddits have done the same so its not a big deviation.,Janna,dac2nud,2,t5_2rutn

10056091,0,t1_dbbhka4,soraka can win trades because of her q but i wouldnt max it. Her w cd is too long early game and improves so much if you max it first. Her q already does a bit of damage early game paired with autos. I was thinking of picking up lulu or morg which would be better?,Janna,dbic002,1,t5_2rutn

10716248,0,t1_ddl9oyi,Taking the example of her ult it knocks enemies away and heals allies. A skill that knocks enemies away and heals allies is inherently better for disengage. There could potentially be a situation where a janna ult should be used to engage or a malphite ult to disengage but that doesnt make it the optimal usage.About the point on opinions yes everyone has their own opinion but that doesnt make all the opinions equally valid. Personally I think what I said stands on its own but if this helps Ive mained janna for years have over . million mastery points on janna and finished challenger on NA season  as a janna main. Anyways I could say my perspective on leona is that its best to build full ap and stay at the back of your team but that doesnt make it right. There is a certain best way to play janna and Id be the first to admit theres always room to improve but building righteous glory isnt how and you cant unlock a better way if it doesnt exist.More than any other champion waiting for your team to do stuff is part of jannas kit. If you want to be the one making proactive plays go play alistar or thresh or something. Due to the reasons I outlined about her abilities thats not the best use of jannas kit. Theyre simply better tailored for reactive disengaging.Just to be clear you dont have to play janna or any other champion any particular way. Sure there are tons of ways to play janna. You can build full ap full ad full tank righteous glory whatever you want. All Im saying is that most of them are wrong read what I said about qer for why. Of course you should do whatever is fun for you just remember that doesnt make it correct play.,Janna,ddlav62,1,t5_2rutn

10835186,0,t3_5uthie,For real though shield yourself and tank for the adc. They never think to protect their supports a lot will save heal for when they need it and will happily let their support die.,Janna,ddxkn3b,2,t5_2rutn

10948928,0,t1_de91zjd,I think EverYellow was referring to her ability to shield towers which she didnt do in the video but reading his comment before watching the video I was expecting it.,Janna,de9ayyq,1,t5_2rutn
11246914,0,t3_60ieza,I still go exhaust.I find it a rare circumstance where Im allowed the freedom to choose between exhaust and ignite. Versus assassins or carries that are slippery to cc with Q proper I find exhaust a must. Next is there really not one person on my team who can pick up Morellos or use Executioners well silly adcs against problematic champions like Swain? And then from there is my adc a champ who needs to snowball more than they need babysitting? Further compounded by the fact that at least for my unranked scrubness people pick certain adcs but dont abuse their strengths ex afk farm Lucian vs Vayne. So even if I took it would it matter? This is my though process for choosing ignite on Janna. With other supports that offer early hard cc and damage Lulu Nami the questions boil down to assassin? snowball?,Janna,df6tkam,2,t5_2rutn

11625722,0,t3_65w5jp,With your second one if you are laning into a squishy support and get ahead early consider W maxing. It comes as a massive surprise to the enemy support when  of their hp disappears to one Janna W.,Janna,dgdsd2p,1,t5_2rutn
11626312,0,t1_dgdrlrt,It evens out around level  and you dont need that much early AP as Janna.  It becomes pretty op midlate game when your shield and movespeed become ridiculous.  Wouldnt recommend it in ranked tbh its more for measing around in normals.,Janna,dgduryz,1,t5_2rutn
11717292,0,t1_dgo5kpk,Its pretty clear that the Janna is the one doing the boosting here. If you look at their op.gg the JG main loses most of his games when hes not playing with the Janna.,Janna,dgo6n5k,2,t5_2rutn
11722958,0,t1_dgn9cc0,Its an alt account possibly even botted. Probably run magic pen reds because they only have basic runes. p,Janna,dgotssr,1,t5_2rutn
