2798964,0,t3_2s4jgv,Take a seat lad and Ill tell you a tale since you asked. My romantic life is in major flux at the moment and thats generally its default position whenever Im not in a relationship. I have a tendency to jump into things and I dont follow through every well. To be honest I really feel uncomfortable with the idea of casual relationships and friends with benefits to me is all icing and no cake. I cant stand the idea. So through my teen years between relationships anyway I ended up getting really good at flirting and not very good at knowing what I actually wanted out of a relationship. This lead to some situations I regret. Id make out with a girl I wouldnt know what to do with her afterwards and Id get nervous and choke up. Unfortunately that means I inadvertently used them and really hurt them when I was too nervous to interact with them after that. Gosh I wish I was honorable enough to go to her and apologize but nevertheless she will remain a lesson for me. And for that I thank her. She deserves much better. Everyone deserves much better someone who is confident and responsible enough with themselves to be confident and responsible with them.  I also attracted the casual daters and friends who wanted benefits which while they were very appealing while they happened they made me sad afterwards. Its very unappealing but unfortunately when I was flirtations and foolhardy those are the sort of girls I attracted. Soon after that period I met my best friend and best companion Ive ever had save for my family. We were compatible friendly caring we shared interests learned so much together we could talk presumably forever. I could never have enough of her. She was a longish distance away but it made no difference. The separation only seemed to strengthen and deepen our relationship. We were disgustingly affectionate we couldnt keep our hands off each other. In hindsight thats something I think Ill be cutting down on in future relationships I sincerely hope Im done with the days of sowing my wild oats but I digress. In the midst of this however a few problems arose. I hate her family and shes uncomfortable around mine and I could never live comfortably with that for long. If we were the last people on earth and we had no family ties we would live happily together presumably until we died. At least thats what it felt like. Unfortunately for us I need a woman who can at least be comfortable joining my family ultimately. In addition I am at a period in my life and she is at a period in her life where we need to split off and grow as individuals. I would never be able to live with myself if she grew into a woman dependent on me as a lover only to be let down years from now for family reasons. Its something I refuse to do. So it had to end and it did. With heavy hearts we parted ways. Since our breakup three months ago I have only received one letter from her for Christmas and Ive sent a reply. We are perfect for each other as a lovers and in our current state disastrous for each other as a serious couple.So that is the stage. Im quietly emotionally reeling from effectively losing my best friend and emotional confidant and I have no one I feel comfortable enough to talk about it with. Over the year that I was in that relationship there were some negative social effects. I did not put myself out in the social scene effectively at my very small very cliquey school. Making fast effective and diverse friends at this point is proving to be a trial. I make it by but that piece of the puzzle is missing. Im missing my confidant in a serious way.So I revert back to flirting with no goal. Im out of practice and out of my league.Im learning that you lose potential friends fast if you flirt real hard and its not an easy place to tread. Having little to offer besides companionship wooing is a tough thing for me to do at this point. Im now shocked that I hit it off with my latest lover so easily. Its discouraging to look at the situation and notice that I was apparently much more attractive years ago. What happened? Am I really unattractive? Am I too selfish? Am I boring? Am I childish? Am I weird? Am I socially inept? These are the things that are on my mind whenever I reflect on my current state of affairs. And honestly the answer is that I probably shouldnt even worry about romance and focus on me for a while. But thats something Ive never done since I first realized how incredibly euphoric a relationship can be and that was a long time ago relatively speaking. Its difficult. And on top of that I have a crush of sorts and a whole lot of what ifs floating around in my head which Im having a hard time putting aside considering that I am at the end of the day sitting squarely in my sexual prime. These are years I dont want to waste being nervous or unsure or anxious about the whole subject.That being said let us begin volume  my crush and my story that pertains to the actual topic. My first real interaction with my crush was on a couch in my schools theater lounge. We were cast in a studentwritten musical I the lead she my main supporting character. We were both sitting on the couch with the director sitting across from us casting his eye of judgment observing as we hashed through the first readthrough of our scene. So far no connection no chemistry. It was fun for the fact that theater is indeed fun but it felt professional almost businesslike. Both doing our best to keep a good face for the director. Between me and her things were friendly but nothing special. Keep in mind I was still dating my ex at that point and that was going splendidly. I had no eye for anyone else particularly for this girl sitting next to me whom I considered to be much more responsible and socially adept than myself. We knew each other only as classroom acquaintances before then. After that day nothing really developed past friendly rehearsals. The show development for a long while consisted of each actor interacting with the director and the directors needs for the scenes not so much actors interacting with the other actors save for me and the female lead we joked during rehearsals it was a comedy after all. As far as my crush and I we knew nothing about each other but we were just friendly for the longest time. Then something blossomed. The week of the show we had a cast party and the cast got a lot closer that night. Forgive me for the vague nature of my description but it is a difficult thing to explain. You know synergy? I think that happened in a social sense. The cast of that show dubbed the Super Cast became a group that changed my life. And it changed the life of my crush as well. I hope that never fades. After that my crush and I got to know each other a little better. At that point I had broken up with my ex and this is when the emotional reeling was kicking in. This is when I reverted back to needless and aimless flirtation. I felt and still feel as though the rug was ripped out from under me and Im stumbling unable to regain balance and not appreciating the cold slippery floor that is now present beneath me. Deep down Im probably afraid that when I finally do get back on my feet that cold slippery floor will feel worse than anything. For the last three months Im struggling and grasping for some piece of furniture for support that just isnt there for me or much too far away to reach. I feel as though Ive alienated one friend already with aimless flirtation a member of the Super Cast no less and Im desperately trying not to alienate another my crush. However shes responding better I think. We had an honest conversation about this at least. There was a party I flirted pretty hard with her and as it turns out shes as unsure as I am about where things will go. I dont want to mess things up. Shes a good person and Id be happy to have her as a friend and nothing more. She knows how I feel but I havent been keeping in touch with her this past month as much as I feel I should be. Am I overthinking this? Is my insecurity about the situation and lack of confidence the very thing that will drive her away? Do I even need her or is this a rush to rebound that Id be better off without? Ive been sitting on these questions for a good while but no ones been around who I feel comfortable enough with to bounce these ideas off of. The person who I used to have for this kind of stuff has been gone for three months and I dont know what to do.I apologize for this rant its probably too long and rambly to read but even if no one does I think I needed to write all that down.,EVEX,cnm8cxb,5,t5_35smv

Sometimes the therapist will throw a phrase or two in to lead your thoughts. But the basic idea is creating a space for your own thoughts to be put into words.This is a neutral place your therapist wont get angry at you. You can literally say anything! That way no one is imposing you a solution to the problem that lies within you. You are the one to searches for clues by hearing yourself talk. The whole thing only works when you want to find a solution though. Its bullshit sending your kids to therapy against their will for example.If you want to find the problem and you get a time room and a place to search for it you will eventually find and solve it.,EVEX,co2pkgf,2,t5_35smv

4895279,0,t1_cuavjit,gtDo you have plans to promote positive behavior? If so what would those presidential actions look like or how would you do that??I plan to continue to be an active member of the subreddit declaring my supportopposition to things as I would normally and encouraging positive behavior by example. If shitposting becomes rampant it may become necessary for me to recommend rulesreferendums and I would in those situations take advantage of the extra Presidential clout to do so in the name of subreddit improvement.gt Im glad you added this note because otherwise I have a lot of questions about that process.Its a zygote now but when I have a skeleton put together Ill make a post about it. gt Im curious what situation you could see occurring where you would choose to push a rule to a vote despite not being in the top .Well I dont really think Id push a rule to a vote at all but for arguments sake Id say that a rule tied for  or off by one that I didnt think was asinine would be one Id push.To revise my original point on referendums as my original statement was rather hurried referendum threads arent out in the open and as a result they can often fall to the wayside. If I see a decent referendum that I think would benefit EVEX Id push it to a vote. Not to seem wishywashy or anything my original comment was made from a restaurant during lunch so there was bound to be some error.gt What do you think about new suggestions for weekly threads like the OC Contest? Well we dont have enough stickies to support it. I would have to agree with uTobl san on this one if you want the subreddit to change field some support for the change before attempting to make it. If as in the linked comment you dont actually want that change yourself and are in fact making it on behalf of a believed need then you should make sure that people want that change.Personally? People can already post CMV threads and debate threads nothings stopping them. Why make the threads mandatory? If you want a regular stream of CMV threads go to the CMV subreddit.Personally I think the OC Contests should take precedence over other proposed weekly threads since they allow for a much wider range of content than anything else proposed. OC Contests really give a nice picture of the kinds of people we are by the content we produce. But thats my .Last thing Im not running under a political party. No offense meant to my competitor of course but I think that candidates should be known for their opinions and actions not whatever appealing moniker they associate themselves with. ,EVEX,cubl81q,2,t5_35smv

4920283,0,t1_cuecwfe,. I think there needs to be middle ground an overbearing President could cause too much conflict but the President taking on a role of a community guide and getting involved when it is important is critical. . Intention is the most important and words in the text of laws should be open for editing with the permission of the original author. The spirit of the law comes first. . I would push for rules that I think are important or clearly in the best interests of the community. . Right now rule repeals seem to be popular so any plan to remove incredibly unpopular rules may very well see my endorsement. I have some personal pet ideas I want see like Freaky Fridays and subreddit style contests. We will see how they pan out I wont spam them. . While it was nice to include the option it pretty much made a decision impossible. The twothirds majority rule for referendums is also proving to be just as troublesome. . The point of revex is to show how a subreddit evolves so I have no ideal shape for this subreddit. It is supposed to be every subreddit and also none of them. The history of this subreddit will be important when analyzed against other subreddits to see if there is a predictable pattern. . The library is important as it keeps track of the history and inner workings of this subreddit keeping the experiment part. . Rules that suggest things other than banning content. I think noninvasive fluff rules are great. I like Eevee and moderators having super powers I suggested the latter.. I think more weekly or scheduled events give the subreddit a lot of potential to grow. I also think that the OC Contest would be more popular if the winner earned Reddit gold. ,EVEX,cueqnry,0,t5_35smv

So it scans from left to right and stops once it finds a pixel that doesnt match with its planned drawing and then it changes that pixel. So theoretically if were running it while other users are still running the dota  script the end result could just end up being the scripts keep fighting over that one pixel and the rest just stays as is.,EVEX,dfqovqa,1,t5_35smv
