1114733,0,t1_chtpeq9,Okay after searching through old posts on the subreddit I found the three classes of ZSZsClass Shockwave Bunker for riding out the initial wave of zombies. Class temporary stakeout for resting and gathering resources. Class Zombie Safe Zone ZSZ for longterm survival.Also I found an old post link talking about writing a pamphlet that would guide survivors through setting up a safe zone gathering supplies the types of safe zones where would be a goodbad place to set up shop etc. Basically our version of the zombie survival guide. I was wondering since its been over a year if you think writing a pamphlet is still a good idea. Oh and Im also thinking about making a post about the three classes of safe zones but I think it would be best to confer with yall ze fellow mods about just what the qualifications are for a safe zone to meet a specific class. It hasnt been clearly defined yet.,Zombiesafezones,chv05p9,1,t5_2ua7i
