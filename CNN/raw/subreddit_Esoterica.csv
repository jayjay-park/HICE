2866298,0,t1_cntnhl9,Having thought about my question over the night I think Ive come to believe in a universal synthesis.That is the actors in the Eden play can simultaneously be all good and all bad.The serpent is the moon imparting knowledge to the morning star so that she can resurrect the sun.  In this all actors are partners and working for the good.But then they can also all be bad as the play represents a struggle over the knowledge of evil and who will be its master.The play itself is just an allegory using cosmic imagery that is rather neutral in the end.  Like all symbols it can be used one way or the other depending on the intent of those using it.,Esoterica,cntwdbg,1,t5_2qkyx
