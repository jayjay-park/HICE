But dont make to many jumps without them catching up. They will get confused and you have to pick them up again. Edit fixed typo and correct keys ,avorion,dcx7d43,3,t5_2xcjs

10551874,0,t3_5r3qfe,The middle ship is my Hiigaran Frigate The sizes are about right my frigate is slightly too big it needs about about  of its current size for correct scale.The shipyard isnt going to be very useable it requires over  crew. On the bright side it has  expansion slots and so supports  turrets,avorion,dd469a6,3,t5_2xcjs

10602348,0,t3_5rgtss,Okay I was having problems with docks and my mine too so went to Discord and got the following infothere has to be several requirements. theres a path from it to space not intersecting the mine. theres sufficient space on either side of it. its facing the right waytheres a little door on the side facing it you may have to rotate it with the R key when placing it to get it right its kind of fiddly and hard without seeing it before you place ittif itts correctly placed you should see a runway of lights leading from space to your new dock. If its not you can just try placing it again.All thanks to NullDragon for the help. Maybe obvious to some it was not to me and maybe others. Hope this helps out.,avorion,dd9juu6,1,t5_2xcjs

10620651,0,t3_5rxis0,Bought this game a week ago already have  hours played.  I like ships that look like guns made a bunch of failed creations while still learning the ropes and lost them in warfare or straightup just losing control and crashing into asteroids. After figuring out how to layer thrusters navigation became much easier. Of course new to the game and lacking shields I was losing turrets. So i said screw it im going to build a flying castle with armor to block incoming fire and it worked albeit poorly.  As I progressed started layering armor and hulls with good combat results. She may be a bit too blocky for some but im okay with that. Early build rear viewI upgraded the material types added some trinium upgrades.. oh and cannons? I friggin LOVE cannons!  Anyways This is my baby at the moment and she might not be the best looking and is still a WIP but having  cannons and tons of HPshields I will just keep adding on to her until I control the galaxy. End result will hopefully be similar to a star destroyer in overall shape but still blocky with as many cannons as I can possibly have unless I find even bigger guns.  She currently has around k hp and shield and over  omicrons for turning pirates and aliens into beautiful splosions.  Also in combat rage I have rammed hard to hit enemies with her and did not explode which is good.  I love this game  ,avorion,ddbfuce,6,t5_2xcjs

10675445,0,t3_5sarpq,How exactly does building mining stations on claimed asteroids work? I have a lot of them claimed and sold some of them off and I now have enough money to upgrade one of them to a mining plant or whatever its called.What happened then? Do I have to constantly defend it? Does it automatically sell the stuff it produces or do I constantly have to go back and harvest it and sell it myself? How much of this is exactly automated?Thanks for the help! ,avorion,ddh3b2a,3,t5_2xcjs

10698759,0,t1_ddh7ocz,I believe I read someone say hyperdrive recharge is dependent on ship whether you pilot it or not. Youll ditch them if theyre not charged. That seems to be my experience too.

10728312,0,t3_5tf4hc,Way too fast  you should slow it down by about half and reupload.Building is nice but it is literally sped up so fast that noone can draw anything from it.

10788369,0,t1_ddslpqm,Think you missed my point Ill try rephase it a bit clearer Come the wafterthrsuter nerf you can still make extremely agile capital ships. You will simply need to dedicate more thruster volume to achieve this effect than you needed before.,avorion,ddsqrlc,2,t5_2xcjs

10900872,0,t1_de3pm3q,Question By doing this can you change the build and then save it for future plans? Also does one need to build very small to keep to the size?

11083146,0,t3_5xzru0,Minings a waste of time imo maybe that changes at the very late game.Just trade or jump to mass signals to sell the big asteroids you find then buy ores in resource stations.Its way easier to buy k ores than it is to mine that many,avorion,deo9jjq,1,t5_2xcjs
11114760,0,t3_5yp7yu,Id probably just use the teleport command finish the quest and keep going as if nothing happened. Also you could probably cancel and restart the quest. That should I imagine cause the objective coordinates to change. ,avorion,derukfb,1,t5_2xcjs

11685564,0,t3_6648b1,I think swapping should have some kind of penalty. Its pretty dumb that I can spec a ship out with rail guns but when I see someone with tough shields could switch my turrets to plasma without consequences. Switching hyperdrive modules after jumping to save energy or popping in shield boosters with the  shield regen on losing shields. The potential for some really scummy plays abusing this is huuuge.Maybe once player owned shipyards are a thing we could have module and turret changes only happen there...,avorion,dgkkr2w,1,t5_2xcjs
