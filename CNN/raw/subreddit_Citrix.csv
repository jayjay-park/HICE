3515172,0,t3_30j2ki,Does this user get a NEW Citrix session every time relaunch app from scratch or do they resume a session in progress when they reconnect?  Probably the latter but its good to know. I didnt understand your use of simultaneously can you explain that?Enable advanced logging on the Receiver client with a few registry changes.  Id also use Wireshark to do a full capture and see if you can catch the drop traffic exchange.Your Citrix provider is likely correct he most likely isnt having an issue or hed see many clients dropping. He also wont have any visibility to the endpoints just a disconnect on his side. Just the way the platform works. He could however give you more to go on.Chances are something is causing your internet to blip quick enough you dont see it but itd be in Wireshark log or a ping t saved to a file but that gives you little info besides ms delay and exact drop time your call. Your tunnel on a VPN is a bit better at retaining connections with packet loss than a Citrix session.Its also possible the Receiver is hosed. Receiver breaks for zero reasons all the time.

3754089,0,t3_33cpt1,This is a HUGE problem in Citrix systems and I have no idea why it never gets any traction online or on Reddit. Theres a huge fucking gap in basic Citrix metrics and unless you pay for a large scale tool SCOM Splunk youre usually fucked. Its mind blowing how many fucks Citrix doesnt give and Ive asked in every webinar and forum they have.That said Ill recommend this again. Ive done it before. ControlUp. Its free for up to  machines concurrently. You can use it on more they just font stay up. Authentication requires an account emailpw in their system like Spiceworks but thats it. This thing has  of the functionality I need and is supposed to be dropping in SQL Databases in the summer. The features theyve added recently...run as a service reporting data retention all rather bush league until SQL are huge compared to where they were.If you want a Citrix and related infrastructure tool without convincing mgmt to buy a huge thing I challenge you to beat this thing. Christ they recently added a mobile app specifically to get alerts you dont even need email. Edit I should mention I have the Comtrade stuff and yeah it works but its beyond overcomplicated to get basic things I want all the time. Maybe its our SCOM system?

Adjust these policies to test Enable Legacy Graphics ModeSet FPS to  or  FPSSet graphics depth to  bit.I would also explore changing ISPs or circuits to accommodate the location.

You are to complete all bullets in the SOW and must meet all objectives.  Plan to be tested on most of the NetScaler features.  Be thorough and make sure to test everything.  The lab time given was adequate but if you are conecrned about time you can always pause the lab and simulate part of the environment with VPX Express or NFR licensed NetScalers and VMware Workstation.  There were some tasks that I had not done before and others that I could do in my sleep.

My boss doesnt understand why we should pay more when we could just continue doing what Ive been doing. And he has a point its kind of my job as an admin to manage this rather than cost him more.
