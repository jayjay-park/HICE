What people are taking issue with is that its not a gimmick  the costumes are a way to put the publics focus on the art.Daft Punk can take off their costume and be unrecognisable by . of the worlds population.  Theyve made a very clear distinction between Daft Punk and them as people.  As people they have shunned fame.What they ate for breakfast where they live who they hang out with who they dont like what they do with their spare time details of their personal relationships what they did last night what they think about various subjects etc. is unknown to almost all of the public.Daft Punk is all about the art.

I pulled into the parking garage its been Too Long. I walked to the alley way where I saw the bright neon poster REVOLUTION  above the back entrance. The security guy knew me for my High Fidelity to the cause and let me in without questioning.   I walked to the back office and turned the OnOff switch but nothing happened. I walked through the curtains onto the main stage to see what the problem was. Bryan and Luke were arguing about something. No Im telling you Television Rules The World. Nobody goes to the theaters anymore. Bryan said. You and your Technologic are bullshit. Luke replied. Guys whats with the lights? I asked. Oh there was a Short Circuit. Toms fixing them now Luke said. Alright well did you get The Brainwasher I asked for? I said. You see Brainwasher was this new drug that made you Lose Yourself To Dance. It was a prototype during the s turned rave drug in the s. Yeah I put a Fresh batch next to the Steam Machine. Luke replied. Alright good cause Im Burnin for one.  This is as far as I could go!

I dont think its any specific piece in particular.According to wikipediagt The solo elements were described playfully as impossible ridiculous Yngwie guitar arpeggios which reflect the fast arpeggiation common with violin parts in classical music. Bangalter acknowledged that Some people might think that the guitar solos on Aerodynamic are in bad taste but for us its all about being true to ourselves and not caring what other people would think. We really tried to include most of the things we liked as kids and bring that sense of fun to it. He also commented that the end of the track is completely baroque music a classical composition we put into synthetic form. emphasis addedYngwie being Yngwie Malmsteen a metal guitarist who implements a lot of neoclassicism in his music.,DaftPunk,cg9fauy,4,t5_2qtn5

I dont think they would be okay taking somebody elses music and trying to arrange it into a coherent body of songs. They know the importance and value of the album as a vehicle of expression and by taking random recordings of Michael from the vault and making their own album from it I think theyd be defiling their own philosophy. ,DaftPunk,ch0fxvy,1,t5_2qtn5

1675511,0,t3_2djino,Can I take a second to share something that relates to this video?Ive listened to Daft Punk my entire life. It wasnt until middle school that I became a serious fan of them but Id always listened to their music. Meanwhile life happened and I had to start picking and choosing what I wanted to do for a jobcareer. The first time I said I wanted to be a musician was in first grade and my teacher said oh thats too hard sweetie. Why not have a backup plan? and I have heard the same thing from that point on. So when everyone knew what they wanted to be army doctor actor software analyst I started feeling alone and depressed. What could I do? I wasnt particularly good at anything. Music was never a viable career option for me.The years passed and instead of creating music I listened to it. Duran Duran Daft Punk David Bowie Rush Pink Floyd Tchaikovsky Skrillex...anything I could find I would listen to. But still music was never an option for me. Fast forward to last year when I saw this video or a version uploaded by a different user Im not sure. I stumbled upon it during one of my more selfdoubting periods and as I watched it I started crying. I was crying and also smiling and I couldnt understand why on earth I was reacting this way to a dude DJing. But when I finished the video something in me felt solid and said that. that is what you want. why arent you doing it? you listen to this guy all the time and look at that. thats where he started. I started learning how to play piano and guitar after I watched this.Throughout the last year I have hit some seriously dark spells of selfdoubt. Each time I feel like Ill fail or get nowhere I watch this or listen to it and it gives me such a strong burst of motivation...When Daft Punk won the Grammys earlier this year I was so happy at their success not only because I felt they deserved it but because it was the biggest motivation for me to work towards what Ive wanted to do since first grade. Part of me wishes I started learning everything about music when I was a kid because Id be so far along now. But another part knows that the timing of me seeing that video of them winning the Grammys this point of my life...its all just right and it couldnt have happened any differently. So. Im finally writing music. Its simplistic and a bit childish and Im awful at the bass the instrument Ive wanted to play since I was little. Ive always been drawn to it and for some reason I play it lefthanded? I dont know. it is what it is and im just starting to learn music theory but at least when I cry now im a bit of a crybaby ill admit it its because Im happy and proud of what Im doing. Life has been a bitch so far but it finally feels right because im making music and living music and its all because I stumbled across this video of mostly Thomas having a good ol time almost  years ago. Thank you for sharing it because I love watching it whenever I can,DaftPunk,cjqczba,13,t5_2qtn5

What I am trying to say is I dont think the robots have ever set out to make a film specifically for each album it just has ended up coincidentally matching up each time.

Wed made Da Funk. And in England and Scotland where our label was there was big pressure and big attention on us especially when you are . It went crazy on us so fast. And we actually did a Da Funk  in the studio. I think weve never talked about it We really thought there was a formula he laughs miming playing a synth Parp parp paaarp parp PARP! I remember feeling we have to kill that stuff and go the other way. There were two roads there and we took the road doing totally the opposite  we did Rollin And Scratchin instead.

Its crazy that Discovery was Daft Punk using samples and now RAM is Daft Punk actually creating the songs and musicians themselves especially the orchestra.
