2286961,0,t3_2ldfut,This is a pretty crazy coincidence. A few years ago inspired by the Garrys Mod game mode Trouble in Terrorist Town I came up with the idea for a game mode where one player plays as a Slasher and can go into a Dungeon Master mode where he sets up traps Wet floor to slip on locked doors to corner them cut phone lines etc. and then chase them down. The victims were more of a Left  Dead kind of experience except with less action and more scavenging for flares fixing the phone lines ways to escape.Obviously Im not trying to imply that its a stolen idea or that I thought of it first. Its a Great minds think alike kind of situation for me and Im pretty happy that its being made. Going to be keeping an eye on it for sure.,survivalhorror,cludvk8,3,t5_2sn9m
2368664,0,t1_cm45wuf,Ty ty very much. i remember being annoyed at the lack of file system when i was younger.But now it felt refreshing. I liked that they put a challenge on you without using the obvious tools like Stronger monsters and less ammo. And yes the fact that any room you had been in had the same status on the map wether you missed something or not was annoying.time to spend the night working on a new review. you gave me confidence.. ty kind sir,survivalhorror,cm4h4g0,2,t5_2sn9m

3183800,0,t3_2wix07,The gameplay is abysmal. The dog is a significant feature of the game and neither behaves like a dog nor like how the game designers had hoped it would. Its incredibly finnicky. As mentioned elsewhere the chase sequences are awful. Only play this game if you really love Clock Tower games as this is sort of a spinoff of the series. ,survivalhorror,cos018v,1,t5_2sn9m

3694895,0,t1_cqd92jy,Yeah at first I thought it was that shitty HD remake but I think its the PC port. On the PS that lighting was scary as shit you could hardly see the mannequin in the back until it jumped up.     Theres a guide out there somewhere on how to properly recreate the atmosphere for the PC port Ill see if I cant scare it up.,survivalhorror,cqdfxyc,1,t5_2sn9m

7983962,0,t1_d4dbf8q,Yeah we shall see. Im too drunk right now to feel any anger. Thats my only effective way of escaping my own degradive thoughts now.. Ya know I just wanted to see a proper Resident Evil  which is basically what the fitst three games in the franchise were but with better graphics and shit ya know ? Its basically all I wanted to see.. I wanted the cheesy dialogue the overthetop crazyi violence of s movies like Dead Alive and all that good stuff you know ? This demo which is available on PS I have PS its just that I dont own PS kinda reminds me of new generation of horror not the old one which RE drew major inspiration from which makes me quite angry but whatever yeah well see.,survivalhorror,d4dh14v,1,t5_2sn9m
