2337341,0,t1_cm0issg,Carbon Fiber in a  knife? Sounds like a dream come true but at that price range a CF balisong would come with wooden handles and blade.,balisongs,cm0lwer,0,t5_2rgx8
2380402,0,t3_2mmet3,Maybe you guys are talking about the entry level BRS model? I havent heard anymore about it lately. They have focused on replicant and the new pABs. But the affordable one is still suppose to come along. The working name was barebones but I think its something else now. ... Thats the only model Im aware of youd be talking about. I think itll be less than  USD. Probably close to .,balisongs,cm5xccr,1,t5_2rgx8

3029077,0,t1_cobyi63,Shame it looks so cool too. The loosening of the handles could be fixed with loctite all balis get loose without loctite but the tang pin falling out is pretty much the biggest deal breaker when it comes to balisongs.,balisongs,cobyme8,3,t5_2rgx8
3110665,0,t1_cokbz4q,Honestly I liked the anodizing too. But after I took the knife apart for lubing and replacing the washers with thicker PB ones I realized that Benchmade kinda screwed up their own anodization.There was one big visible spot in a very conspicuous location where it wasnt even anodized. Bothered me to no end and since Im in Canada I cant just send it to BM and get them to send it back.First I tried to chemically remove the anodizing without using Hydrogen Fluoride which is pretty deadly... No avail so I had to use some polishing cloth to do it by hand... Didnt even have fine grit sandpaper or buffing compound. Just hours sitting in my dorm room rubbing the liners against the cloth. But hey it retained the jewelled pattern! ,balisongs,cokf3sa,2,t5_2rgx8

3263842,0,t1_cp07uo2,Sorry for the double reply but im just curious as to how long you let it sit for before you started to flip it again. Did you let it set for a whole  hours?,balisongs,cp0b4qe,2,t5_2rgx8
