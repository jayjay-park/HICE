410021,0,t1_cfn8onv,You have raised very valid points and how well we would address these queries would determine the success of our venture. .  The transactions would be completely online. Just like the hotel industry if you want to rent something you can place an order online and cash will be deducted from your account and then you will be connected to the renter. So you can see that it is more of ebay  a marketplace.  . We are trying to provide some sort of insurance cover while the product is out on rent. This is yet to be finalized but we are sure about bringing in some sort of coverage for your products while on rent.  With respect to resolution we are going to have to get down and get our hands dirty I have friends who are in the rental business and have seen that people who rent stuff actually take very good care of the product than the owner themselves. It seems very counter intuitive. If dispute arises we are planning to do something in the sorts of what paypal does. Listen to both parties and do what would be the best for both of them even it may result in some sort of monetary loss to us. .Initially we wish to encourage people to rent out stuff within their neighborhood to friends of friends to bring in the trust factor plus people can also take a security deposit it they feel necessary. A decent car for a day would easily fetch  to  rupees so its easy income of about  to k a month. Once a few perfect transactions happen we feel the trust issue will not be as big as a problem as it was in the beginning. ,indianews,cfn9jya,3,t5_2qi1m

There was peace in Jammu amp Kashmir. Soon after Modi government came terrorist activities started. Now terrorists not tourists are coming to KashmirMy answer to him is by that token Modi is responsible for the huge voter turnout in JampK  so to be fair he did something wrong if we take your criticism of increasing terrorist activities and did something right as well.By the way would be curious to know if any media or any hawk in BJP utilises this opportunity to stoop as low as Congress and say Rahul Gandhi behind terrorist attacks because till Congress was ruling center they were controlling them and now theyve unleashed terrorists on poor people of JampK to show Modi in poor light.gt Before elections wherever he goes communal riots take place. Be it in Maharashtra Delhi or Uttar Pradesh communal riots definitely take place. They put people of one community against the people of another community. The election takes place after the communal riots.Congress is still not done licking their wounds and nether regions of Congress royal family.If at all this charge was true at that time people wouldve voted for Congress. Or Congress being in center would have prevailed and contained the riots. Btw there are news articles in early govt days upto th aug where some Congress people allege that communal incidents increased since Modi govt came into center.Would be interesting to note how many media people actually dig up those reports and ask Rahul Gandhi about the contradiction. Scratch that I dont think even if they ask Rahul or anybody in Congress is going to answer it.gt They want to snatch away the power from you. They are trying to dilute Land Acquisition Bill MNREGA scheme and other laws which we broughtRahul please to ask your mother who keeps saying Modi is just repackaging Congress policies and plans  and here you are saying he is diluting it.

2552582,0,t3_2oydx4,One word  brainwashing . I think exposure to ideas through centralised education and directed media has a profound effect on a persons thinking . These methods of indoctrination can often easily triumph over cultural beliefs and knowledge . I remember in  when I was still in school  I was pretty far left . The only papers I read was hindustan times and toi with almost daily exposure to articles by vir sanghvi  burkha dutt and bachchi karkaria . I had a raging hatred for vhp and modi . As the years have passed I have become far right  almost moving into nazi territory . The only difference has been the books and different viewpoints I have acquired through the net . That is  all . The point being  man is far less intellectually independent than he thinks he is  and the role of academia and media is much more important than we often suspect .Man thinks he is thinking but mostly reacts to instinct .  Media is capable of subconsiouly shaping this instinct and thus changing the very nature of our self.A lot of behaviour of our sickulars is not even the result of consious thinking but visceral reaction brought about through years of brainwashing . This is why control over media and academia is more important than political power . Political power gives you external power over an indivisual . You can punish a person that doesnt do what you want him to do . But through media and academia you can so deeply influence his thoughts and values that he will do what you want him to do and attribute every bit of that action to his freewill.,indianews,cmrrcfu,4,t5_2qi1m

To have something so coincidental on top of that mother protecting son and husband being blind son killed by another person fooled by a trickster is rare. It can be even possible that mistletoe refers to druids of the Celts as they value mistletoe. Also their version of Bheem is their national hero so that may have a deeper connection than so far thought of. Does that mean the Mahabharati Bheem had Irish affinities? I dont know. Wait for my next post.The first story IMO cannot be an independent innovation. Maybe Loki being a milkman is but not the first part. That is unreally similar.Once you think it through even Ragnarok will become familiar as the Rig Vedic Dasarajna. I will make a separate post on that. On that and why Norse mythology probably confirms that the IndoEuropeans were most probably in India or north of India but always in the Indian subcontinent including Afghanistan.But Im convinced even the Loki being a milkman is not a fraudulent story.

It was the good fortune of all the countries that have been part of the British empire. The British took colonialism very seriously and brought an extraordinary talent to bear on it. I would only add that once having gone for a vacation in Goa I have a very favourable view of the Portuguese. Charming place and charming people responded to a good Portuguese Catholic upbringing.He isnt wrong. The outlook editor on the other hand is a bag of shit for the horribly leading questions and the terrible headline for the interview. The other European Imperial powers Portugese Belgians French Spaniards etc. have a horrific record when it comes to their colonies.

If  such people are there we are in business.it is a mistake to assume that large protests and big media coverage are important in activism.  the actual battle is fought in the courtrooms.  for example the judge hearing the porn case clearly told us what any person can do if the court issues instructions to ban porn sites.  one person  ONE PERSON  needs to go to court on monday and say exactly what the judge said violation of article  etc.  and the ban will be lifted.  i know what needs to be done.  but will I do it?  no.  because i have a day job.tldr get subramanium swamy to start an NGO and people will start sending him money.,indianews,ctp25wj,2,t5_2qi1m

Economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das later told reporters there would be no compromise on KYC norms under the scheme and all requirements of the Income Tax Act  would have to be met. We do not want unaccounted wealth to be converted into white through these schemes he stressed.

Basic stuff will be provided for free. It does not mean that people will stay on the free version of the Internet and never go anywhere else. people will pay for access to the real internet like they are doing now. If and when we get enough speed to start worrying about superfast lanes and slow lanes etc. then it mightand a very faint one at that become an issue. And I dont see anything in the regulations to suggest that entire websites will be closed off unless u pay to activate them on an already paid subscription.It takes a lot of imagination to come up with such things btw. I am not surprised though. generated fears like these and FUD during the early years of our Independence and even latter years led us to not letting in new technologycompanies that could do something for our country.

I say Lord Buddha and you say he is not mentioned in Puranas where there are several at least  Puranas links that mention Lord Buddha. And you throw this gemgtIf you got it from Wikipedia then I would encourage you to go and do a thorough study of your own books.and then this gtGautama Buddha is never mentioned as an avatar of Vishnu in Puranasand I laugh because you are now running out of room to squirm for your lies. Just because facts do not agree with your internal dialogue doesnt mean the facts are wrong. It just means that the belief system that you are holding on to so dearly needs to be questioned more. gtConsidering Buddhas philosophies were in stark contrast with Hindu philosphy logically it is impossible to consider that as a fact.Do you even know that  avatars of Vishnu Lord Parashuram and Lord Ram got into a fight at the time of Rams marriage to Sita? Every avatar comes with new ideas and rules that are appropriate for that age. Just because the ideas are different and sometimes contradictory doesnt negate that avatar or the Puranas. And you are no Hindu scholar to negate what Hindus believe. gtShow me where is Vishnu or Durga walking around in public right now and I will accept I am wrong.How about a different God worshipped by Hindus? Hindus worship Mother Earth. You want to show me where she is? Ether air fire water earth planets all creatures directions trees and plants rivers and seasthey all are organs of Gods body.

Would that org rightly evolve for issues like gay rights? And by Hindu org you mean which adheres to Sanatana Dharma right? Because I agree that will propagate values which will definitely place women on the pedestal they deservethere was no rape culture even in wars before mughalwest invasion correct?Hinduism is inherently a faith that uniquely advocates adjustment to time and active questioning. Hinduism doesnt say anything against gays. Nor gay marriage. Hinduism defines marriage as the union between two souls. As opposed to the Abrahamics who say that it is the union between a man and a woman.Regarding women although it wasnt complete equality there was a progression in the right direction.

Thats wrong and the most fundamental violation of Classical Liberalism.I dont believe in homosexual marriage. I never will. Marriage is to establish family to build society and culture. Homosexuality is the opposite. It cannot and should not build society it is amusement and pleasure of a personal sort nothing more.The reason why they want gay marriage is because it will upset the Church and the religiously minded.

The God delusion and who are sometimes even acting upon it in grim and deadly ways the significance of that book is groundbreaking. Its started a movement or at the very least provided the opportunity for a much needed discussion. Make no mistake none of this matters if we inadvertently end up descending into a state of psychosis and chaos fuelled by peoples penchant for lending credence to fairytales antiscientific explanations of worldly matters and blind beliefs.You dont have to agree with every argument he makes but simply based on the unfounded inflexibility of ones mind to dis the whole enterprise would be gross.

11351682,0,t3_61xmnr,I think the assumption that Governments around the world have the ability to actually monitor their citizens information outside of basic basic info is folly. Its difficult and the infrastructure needed is quite gargantuan to process through so much data. I think people overestimate government desire and willpower to actually do any of these things. Furthermore Aadhars primary purpose is to ensure that any future social welfare programs have very little cost to the exchequer as money is delivered straight to your account without any middleman BS or need for twenty different documentations of ID proof. Its hassle free for the citizen and the govt. And finally the biggest boon is for those who are supposed to be earning minimum wage but arent given it because nobody even knows how many such people are in the informal workforce. India has one of the highest if not the highest levels of informal workforce and as such Aadhar is a good way to monitor that people are actually getting the minimum wage and chasing those organisations up who dont follow the rules because they probably are doing tax avoidance as well. Theres very few downsides apart from the possibility of a govt bigbrother thing though Id argue that being a democracy and not a communist state its very difficult for any government to get away with passing such a law.,indianews,dfioxi8,2,t5_2qi1m

11810021,0,t3_68f6ry,gt copied from rsingapore  the concept of Liberal Arts is an Americanization and should not exist outside the USA...I got annoyed enough to write this out liberalism was an ideology defined in Europe to contrast the fedualism and christian authoritarianism that was prevalnt at the time it advocated liberal economic policies freemarket and a decentralization of churchowned assets. it has nothing to do with socialism. and the concept of liberal arts does not exist anywhere outside the United States. The United States is hardly the global bastion of qualityoflife and is far behind on social policies in comparision to much of the western world. And to give privilage to UScentric terminology in a setting where Europe India CanadaAustraliaNZ and East Asia also play a huge infuential role is incredibly offensive. Liberalism does not acquire the same progressive or humanist connataions outside the United States. It usually means liberalfreemarket economics and it was liberalism that created the multiculturalism thats causing problems throughout Europe right now the Muslims were not forced to integrate or assimilate and they are a causing a lot of trouble for them. You shouldnt just blindly subcribe to liberalism without understand what it implies. The subreddit is too accepting of American imperialism. I have been through western education and would happily apply to universities like Yale but that does not mean that I agree with its attempts to impost western ideologiesthinkingculure onto foriegners. I would rather that Americanization was balanced out with equlavents from other cultures whenever possible i.e. Yale vs Tshuinga EPL vs IPL English vs Chinese vs Tamil vs Malay etc... I personally think that the predominant reason why Western Europe surpassed Asia in terms of GDP per Capita was due to the ability to grow their economies through colonialism.,indianews,dgypgh1,1,t5_2qi1m
