If I pulled  OS units and their weapons and managed to clear everything for the next  years then they wouldnt get any money to keep on producing new content to clear with those units. The thing about the recent banners is they perform fantastic in their respective banners see Yui and Strea but lack the versatility outside these events to keep up. Power creep needs to be slow or it kills a life span of a game. So they opt for optional banners that people can spend money on for Top RanksAesthetics.

11674062,0,t3_66fwyg,It seems that a lot of people at confused by the setup of the departures and equipment locks. The event is divided into  sections of  floors apiece with a travel gatecheckpoint after every th floor. A lot of people have been saying that if they die completely then they dont get to restart at all and are done with the event which is not the case. If all your characters die then you simply have to restart at the last checkpoint. The no restart policy means that yo cant restart or retry the current floor that youre on so for example if you die on floor  then you would have to restart back at floor . Now the departures also reset every time you get to a travel gate which means if you die and go back the departures of your characters resets and youre able to change their equipment which is only locked while they are departed. Now the departures also get reset when you get to a new travel gate as well. Hope this clears things up for everyone.,MemoryDefrag,dgj9rt0,3,t5_3g3s7

When theyre disappearing offscreen or backing away theyre sure to be charging next. React to it by dodging or parrying. Try to get a feel and remember the exact distance of their charge attacks. They can end up falling short in their attack if you dodge or you can position yourself in a parrying position to anticipate it. Sometimes its better to be defensive rather than just hacking away at them. Block andor parry then use sword skills whenever possible. Move around and then position yourself for counterattacking. And if youre able to use  or more characters switching around can be useful to get out in a tight spot and dealing damage. Thats about it. The rest is how you can dodge and parry successfully.

If you are looking to limit break then it isnt a bad idea to invest it into an OS unit first depending on who you have.
