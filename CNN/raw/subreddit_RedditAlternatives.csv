It also joins you to my own community tunderdogmusic but you can easily leave if youre not interested in it.Snapzu is seriously great and shows a lot of promise. It also helps that its not trying to be just like reddit.

4512178,0,t1_csz47ua,But the cats out of the bag now. If reddit later imposes policies that users wont like they might go elsewhere. Voat hasnt been idle and they will be better prepared for the next migrational event.I hadnt heard about Voat before the AMAgeddon and now I know at least other  alternative sites and a new distributed iniciative based on the experimental Aether PP.Just imagine if a group of competitors agree to form a redditlike network with shared subs where messages censored by one site will still be posted in another. Even if they all agree to the same policies competition will ensure they wont censor beyond reasonable limits.Basically Victorias firing smashed open a huge hole in reddit and Paos resignation managed to contain it but the cracks wont close completely.

4747956,0,t3_3fup5w,It should have its servers located in the most favorably country in regards to laws concerning internet freedom. Furthermore it would then obviously have to allow everything that is not illegal.I think it would be a good idea to have two separate votes one for I agree with this and one more along the lines of This is newadds to the discussion. Maybe you could even offer an additional reviewing system for posts and comments that is much more in depth and split in various categories. Ranging from being able to rate insignificant stuff like grammar spelling and formatting to being able to rate sources facts and argumentative structure. Maybe even other things like tone comedy value and whatever else you can imagine.That way you avoid a lot of problems the community runs into currently. Everyone could see more easily what they are getting into and filter their experience better towards their viewing pleasure this way. Also you could avoid a lot of perceived circlejerking and the like. I feel like a lot of drama is stirred up by people misinterpreting voting trends. For example the classic one is God doesnt exist would almost always get downvoted heavily. Not because people dont agree with it even though surely some downvotes would stem from that too but because it is perceived as old and rude to say on reddit. Someone who is not familiar with the reddit culture would now be questioning what reddits general consensus is on this matter without any chance to understand it fully. This applies to almost every statement made on reddit but most often even more complex. That means people have a lot of trouble with even identifying what the general consensus is and isnt. Much less so why it would be. It leads to all sorts of misunderstandings and I think this is also the biggest problem of why there seems to be stagnant or circlejerking discussion in the first place.There should also be a more elegant solution regarding vote manipulation and votes in general. I think it doesnt make much sense to ban asking for upvotes altogether. People will just post their link anyway without doing so and the same result in terms of vote skewering will occur. I would rather show on a post or comment from where the votes originate if thats somehow a technical possibility.Another good feature would be the possibility to post anonymous whenever you desire to do so.This and some other technical advancements especially regarding mod tools would be extremely nice in my opinion.,RedditAlternatives,ctt0wtg,2,t5_2ufot
4759474,0,t1_ctugd45,I guess. Nothing about Digg was unique to be honest. Lots of sites combined user contributed content and voting before Digg did. One notable example is Fark.com. Also correct me if Im wrong but Digg didnt let anyone create subs and moderate them. But to be honest there as well thats noting unique to Reddit thats how pretty much ever forum software works.,RedditAlternatives,ctuh6mo,2,t5_2ufot

I did something similar a while back however found that the overhead of WordPress wasnt worth the end cost.As Im typing this Im waiting for a category to load. Ive had enough time to type this and attempt to load that same category a second time. Its still loading. Your server situation could be an issue with the unresponsive nature of the project or it could be poor optimization.Its still loading.The layout also strikes me as too Facebooky when opening images to comment. It has potential there are just a few hurdles to clear.By the way still loading. edit nevermind Cloudflare just alerted me that the website is offline.

10542768,0,t1_dd30dwl,Some feedback after signing upThe signup acceptance page linked to in the email has a spelling error honoring not honering.The layout feels way too spaced out for my liking. The best thing about Reddits layout is that I can see lots of stuff at once. I changed the thumbnail size to small for the feed which made it better but I can still only see four submissions before scrolling.Speaking of scrolling are you doing something in JS that modifies normal native behaviour? Your site seems to scroll much less per mouse wheel notch than is normal.In the feed there doesnt seem to be any indication of how many comments a post has.Overall I think the site is okay and I wish you luck with it but at the moment I cant think of a reason for me to go there instead of Reddit.,RedditAlternatives,dd3529u,1,t5_2ufot
