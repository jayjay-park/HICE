As a peruser of conspiracy I feel that those in charge sort of know that theyre treading the line between saving that cost and the social unrest it brings and keeping it just under a boiling point is key.So yes do it quickly.  But it doesnt take many more seconds to do it in a way that doesnt have them freak out and extend the entire ordeal anyway like this guy does.Edit I agree with you that theres an overall sort of pragmatic benefit in the expedience but theres a shortterm effect as well in the way we go about it and that costs resource as well.  Someone does the math for us here and thats why it is how it is.,bodycam,d0qlsxr,1,t5_3226y
