749096,0,t3_22nkfg,Armor has to approach things differently we cant be tied to one cap. My goal on each map is to hold or dominate at least  caps on every map moving between the two back and forth destroyingconfronting enemy armor approaches as they leave their base. One of the reasons I win something like  of the time is that even if my team is composed of a bunch chucklefucks spotting them  caps means they only have to take  or  more to win.Thats all going to change on Saturday  their best players will be running crewed tanks and I expect to get destroyed a lot by their armor with a reduced capacity to dominate caps. But the priniciples remain the same.  I doubt anyone is going to read this but here are the caps I push on default maps regardless of spawn side to get you thinking about where your tanks LAVs and attack boats will beSeige E amp B A a decent amount. C is impossible and D is almost entirely a no goLancang A amp E B a decent amount C if I can get there D quickly Zavod A amp E B and F a decent amount C amp D are basically no gosHainan B amp E A hard if its on my teams side no go or rare if not.

3433225,0,t3_2zj64j,I went through  pairs of headsets before I settled on As. Some of my older ones either crapped out on me after a short while of use or I returned them after tryingtesting them out.AstroI use Astro As with the Xbox One Chat Adapter Ive been using this pair for the past  years since they launched and havent had any issues. They are very comfortable have a very sturdy build qualityfeel and now come in a nice variety of colors compared to the original blackred ones that I have. The sound quality is the best Ive heard from a gaming headset. The Astros are a little more bassy than other headsets so explosions sound great with it. They are wireless but are still connected to the controller with the chat adapter. The mic quality is a little sketchy at times. The unidirectional microphone delivers communication to your teammates by isolating your voice from any background noise in the room and this sometimes causes the mic to sound quiet or far away when you first start talking because it has to adjust to your level of speaking. There is also a little bit of feedbackecho from your mic in the party when other people speak. This is something that seems to be due to using the As with the Xbox One Chat Adapter happens with me and other RSOC that have As. But the mic is also convenient in the sense that you can flip it up to mute the mic.Pros Sturdy build quality comfortable good sound quality wireless flipup mic to mute Cons Expensive aux cable still connects the headset to the chat adapter plugged into your controller mic quality.Turtle BeachIve had a few pairs of Turtle Beach headsets before I got my As and they were all crap. Had a pair of Xs for about over a year and they broke mic stopped working and had issues with sound cutting out. I then tried a pair of XPs and returned them after a couple weeks because of audio quality and chat cutting out.Overall bad build quality not so great audio quality TB has notoriously terrible wireless issues cutting out static feedback stuttering clicking etc. I cant speak to new ones that are out now but my experience with TB have all been bad ones. They do however have the only  fully wireless headsets for Xbox One that I know of.TrittonTritton at least back in the day had good sound quality kind of cheap build quality. They felt like they were made out of cheap plastic and that made them feel fragile. I tried out a pair of Warheads and liked them but returned them out of fear of breaking them. I did have a few friends that had Tritton Pros and AX s. Out of the three friends two had their headsets physically break. One had his earphone snap right off and the other had the earphone snap off but up higher towards the part that rests on your head.I cant speak much to using nongaming headsets as I havent used them. That would be more Ravi or Unis territory. Hopefully my two cents helps aid you in your search!,RSOC,cpjm3m5,4,t5_2zqo9
