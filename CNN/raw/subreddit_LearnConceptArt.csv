9754814,0,t3_5eu8y6,Go for it. Take note of the hsv sliders when you do color pick. A lot of times color is a lot less saturated than you think it is. Very rarely will you see a fully  saturated color in real life. You might also notice that sometimes youll perceive a color as one color when its really a bunch of different colors that when placed close together gives off the impression of a different color. Trees are a pretty good example of this. A tree trunk is not simply brown. Color is really interesting once you start to really study it. ,LearnConceptArt,dafhzid,2,t5_2vurd

They can be in much less detail for sure. Cleaned up sketch is fine.Basically as a concept artist you cant just draw something one time and say this is it!. So you need to show them thats not what you did.Hope that makes sense!,LearnConceptArt,dcd0a33,1,t5_2vurd
