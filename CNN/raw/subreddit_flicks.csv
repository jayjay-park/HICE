2310245,0,t1_clx917g,Im not a fan of Poltergeist. Always found it mediocre to tell you the truth. The idea of a family horror film never sat well with me at least in its execution or maybe its inferiority in comparison to Sci Fis allages equivalent E.T. is too great to ignore. And on that theres always the belief that Spielberg held more directorial control over Poltergeist than Hooper did and it shows I think making it an irrelevant factor entirely. Mate mate mate I cannot express how much I agree with your distaste for Wes Craven who is easily I think one of the most overrated directors of all time certainly of horror. I dont even like Nightmare frankly though Scream I dont mind in spite of its offputting smugness it doesnt take a genius to realise that the slasher genre has a fucking formula. I too hate Last House on the Left but I at least find some creative atmospheric merit in The Hills Have Eyes still a bad movie but not one of the worst in my opinion. The only Craven film Ive really liked was The Serpent and the Rainbow and I didnt mind The People Under the Stars also Ive really tried to like this guy so Ive attempted to verse myself well. ,flicks,clx9g9x,2,t5_2uiee

2412121,0,t3_2n2xfi,gt influence on Kubricks performance in The ShiningIll just quickly take this time to mention an interesting fact that novel fans of The Shining are even today outraged with the films disservice to the book. My parents who didnt care remember their friends and many other coworkers etc who were fans of the book being just pretty pissed off. I think whats important is that performances such as Cagneys helped to introduce over the top performances like you said but it was a spark that helped alight a new movement in acting Theres a huge difference between acting from pres and posts particularly with posts having a greater focus on... simply put nonrealism. As you said theres a contrast to naturalism and posts acting had an uprise in performances that were extremely surreal ridiculous melodramatic etc. Of course it can be argued that acting pres also felt quite planned and contrived but acting today can be seen as very systematic. As much as I love Aaron Sorkins work he writes in an idealised way  his dialogue is an archetype of exact and perfect communication. Thats systematic unnatural dialogue as opposed to the authentic dialogue yet systematic acting of pres. ,flicks,cm9uic3,3,t5_2uiee
2412514,0,t1_cm9w6l2,I was going to say that. Its interesting those original Batmans were marketed at the time as being darker and more psychological I even remember seeing an interview with Peter Weir at the time where he said dark and psycological with an eyeroll. Really every Batman movie has been presented as dark and gritty. The original Batman series was certainly silly though.Comedicgoonish performances are probably a different category again. That type of Jim Carey performance probably more has its roots way back in the old Three Stooges movies. A good performer to look at is Pacino.

2456609,0,t3_2nnp5g,How to fix the opening scene of Inception. Have Nash a professional extractor know what a kick is. When Arthur says give him the kick Nash performs the kick with no messing around. The audience puts two and two together and links kick with falling.  . Abandon the water kick idea in the first scene.  It doesnt need to be explained here and directly contradicts the scene later where merely falling out of your chair is enough to kick you.  There is no need for a secondary kick in this scene.  . Arthur is in a sturdy armchair that is backed against a wall and is not set up for a kick. This is immediately noticeable you didnt notice but your brain did and just highlights the fact that this scene makes no narrative sense but only makes sense in a meta awareoftheaudience way. You can still establish that dying in a dream kicks you and in fact having Cobb kill Arthur is a fantastic choice in order to show this. ,flicks,cmfc7ao,7,t5_2uiee

Not to give much of the plot away I liked the ending which most people hated especially what happened to the monster afterwards. As a person diagnosed with depression I can say that the movie found a very intelligent way of treating the Babadook.    Essie Davis gives an amazing performance. I read somewhere that she was so good for playing both Wendy and Jack Torrance in the same movie. Thats how I feel too.    The techincal aspects are also so good. The cinematography is amazing turning the huge house into something so claustrophobic with the use of shadows. The sound design is also amazing how to forget the BABA...DOOK!DOOK!DOOK!?

2781409,0,t1_cnk83zr,gt Contained in flashbacks and we never see them interact outside of the notes. The only reason you get any feeling about their relationship is because Turing named his machine Christopher and boy!Turing cries when Christopher dies.I actually didnt care for the naming of the machine. That to me was particularly saccharine and I also picked up on the nature of their relationship the moment he befriends him when the other boys dont. From that point on it was clear that Alan was going to fall in love with this schoolmate.gt is the absolute focus of very few scenesIts actually the focus of their scenes the moment they meet. Neither women nor homosexuals were perceived as equal to men at the time. Gays were outlaws and women were secretaries. Theres a reason so many gay men and straight women understand each other and you can see that understanding throughout this film. Honestly they only have each other in this world.gt He doesnt relate to anyone in the film.No he doesnt and thats where the film toes the line between his sexuality and his psychological state. Turing doesnt even understand himself much less the world around him. Thats why he finds solace in machines. Its basic and unfettered by the emotional complications of human interaction.gtIs this brought up in the movie at all? Did I simply miss it?Its made clear that he did visit a prostitute and thats what he was trying so desperately to conceal. Its the whole reason for the subplot with the cop attempting to arrest him.gtWe see him express his feelings about his sexuality literally once after the story is over. The other times his sexuality is at all considered is when the detective wants to bury him for being gay and the threats of him being thrown in jail for it are thrown around.I suppose this is where the tricky issue of subtext comes in. In this regard we might as well have been watching different films.gtI dont think it was clearly shown besides again in the final scene.It was clear to me throughout. Theres a brief scene in the beginning showing a kid sketching on the train and Alan notices him. No one else in the car cares about the kid but Alan does. This wasnt some throwaway scene.

2821640,0,t1_cnmneci,The fact that the character is so affable and kindhearted makes it inherently less creepy.  That said I dont think you are accurately describing the plot at least to my recollectiongtThe one thing that never sat right with me with About Time was how he uses his powers to manipulate his eventual wife. He sabotages the relationship she is already in by going back in time and preventing them from ever meeting then gets to know her before going back in time and using his acquired knowledge of her to charm her.He first meets her and charms here without any use of his timetraveling skills at all in the nolights restaurant.  His only prior use of his skills to try and get a girl to like him the hot blonde friend of his sister fail miserably.While he does use knowledge acquired from subsequent time travels to help convince his futurewife into leaving the party where she would have eventually met the other guy it is only a single sentence related to her Kate Moss fandom.  That is hardly heavy manipulation.  gtShe rejects him multiple times but he just travels back in time and tries again until he gets it right. To my recollection this isnt accurate at all.  She was clearly very interested in him based on their first unmanipulated meeting and obviously very interested in him after their second first date to the point that she slept with him.  He only used his time travel powers on this second date to get the first sexual encounter right.  Again not heavy manipulation.Hell Id love to be able to go back in time and relive the first few dates with the woman who eventually became my wife several times.

2961007,0,t3_2u2b3r,Pink Flamingos  Directed by John Waters Synopsis  Notorious Baltimore criminal and underground figure Divine goes up against Connie amp Raymond Marble a sleazy married couple who make a passionate attempt to humiliate her and seize her tabloidgiven title as The Filthiest Person Alive.I was just not ready for this.  Id heard the movie had a reputation but nothing about why it had the repualtation.  Knowing very little about movies being captured for obscenity Im kind of surprised nothing happened here especially considering Jonas Mekas was arrested on obscenity charges just  years earlier for showing Flaming Creatures and Un chant dAmour neither of which have anything on this.It certainly lives up to the plots ambitions and the low quality acting and production really add to the legitimacy of the flithiness.   Honestly the last scene was probably the closest Ive come to legitimately throwing up over a movie which I wasnt sure would be possible.  Sal o le  giornate di Sodoma Sal or the  Days of Sodom  Directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini Synopsis  Four fascist libertines round up nine adolescent boys and girls and subject them to a hundred and twenty days of physical mental and sexual torture.And in an interesting contrast to Pink Flamingos heres Sal whose reputation overstepped the actual movie.  The lack of personal development of any of these characters and the cold presentation keeps it from getting to the levels that Pink Flamingos gets to.  Its actually much easier to not be too disgusted by seeing people eat fake shit after youve seen someone Spoilers!s actually eat dog shit.The metaphors about fascism work well but the overall quality of the movie works against the shock.  As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty  Directed by Jonas Mekas Synopsis  Director Jonas Mekas provides an intimate glimpse of his personal life by constructing a feature length narrative from over  years of private home movie footage.Mekas describes his film best near the end as a film about people who never argue or have fights and love each other.  The collection of home movies is put together largely by chance which Makes had said he decided on in the beginning of the movie.  It does give a certain sense of intimacy sharing both little happy moments like picnics and lazy Saturday afternoons and big happy moments like the birth of both children baptisms and first steps.  It does feel like you are only seeing part of the story though.  Its also largely bogged down by the nearly  hour runtime.There are certainly glimpses of greatness in that time though particularly when Mekas switches from addressing the viewer to addressing his family wondering how they feel about these memories his and how their memories of the moments differ.  Maybe if Id experienced things like the family moments presented the runtime wouldnt have been as much of an issue.  God tier title though.  Dekalog  Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski Synopsis  Ten television drama films each one based on one of the Ten Commandments.Yes this is technically a TV miniseries but Im including it since it is on the  Movies to Watch Before You Die list.  Its highly praised by critics and viewers.  Kubrick described it the only masterpiece that he could name in his lifetime.  It certainly deserves the credit that it gets.Each episodes starts with the name of a commandment but the episode is generally not really contained to only one commandment.  From what Ive read Kieslowski never explicitly stated which commandment goes with which episode.  None of the episodes are easy little moral tales either.  Its more of an examination how these old rules apply to current life.  With the exception of the first commandment have no other gods before me none of the episodes are simple black and white issues and to be honest itd be hard not to make the first commandment not black or white.There are definitely variations on some of the commandments.  Dont take the lords name in vain for example deals with a doctor reluctant to give his word to a patients wife that the patient would live or die.  He doesnt want to swear either way and she needs to know because she is pregnant by another man and just decide on an abortion.  It cant even be said that the characters breaking the commandments are always punished for their actions.  Like I said earlier its more an examination than moralistic preaching.By far the best episodes with the first and fifth thou shall not kill.  The first has an amazing scene in a church Spoilers!s involving a picture of the Virgin Mary and a knocked over candles wax making it look like shes crying.  The fifth instead of focusing simply on murder looks at using killing as a punshiment for killing.  This episode and another were explanded upon into feature movies and Im excited about checking them out.Not every episode was amazing but none was outright horrible.  They all certainly combine into something amazing. ,flicks,co4oiqt,3,t5_2uiee

3095279,0,t1_coiptrx,I think a lot of it was just lack of exposure to better things. I had read good books before but I hadnt really read books with any remotely compelling or better romantic storylines or characters and the whole ancient vampire powers thing was appealing and I was and still am an escapist though for some reason I didnt like scifi so this whole universe seemed like a superior alternative to the one I lived in.They made the Bella character very plain and boring so it would be easy for the reader to substitute herself in that role. As for the Edward character I suppose the reader finds him attractive for the same reason someone finds Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire attractive. Only the reader is  years old so she hasnt been exposed to the same themes executed in far far better ways. You dont realize how unoriginal they are and how halfbaked they are at the things they do attempt. I think of it kind of as if they took a Bronte or Jane Austen novel and removed anything that you had to think about for more than a second. Have you ever read Pride and Prejudice? I think the feeling is kind of similar except if youre  reading Twilight you just dont have the experience to recognize that Twilight isnt any good whereas someone with more experience would likely only find something like PampP satisfying because of its artistic value and nuance and nonabusive love interests. Like its not so much that there is a whole lot to like about Twilight but you just dont really have the knowledge of much better a novel can be. Does that make any sense?If youre interested I found this where some people talk about the themes of unconditional love and things like that which they found moving. I just realized in your original comment you said aware of the nature of the relationships but honestly I think amongst Twilight fans those are few and far between.I think part of it was also that my friends really liked it when most of the things I really loved to read didnt interest my friends. It was very socially encouraged. That might be as big a factor as any honestly. Oh and assuming you havent read the books the movies are much worse and thats really saying something. The movies dont really accurately represent the whole fantasy you get reading the books I think thats a situation where everyone reading the book is far better served by their own imagination. The movies were actually partially what made me realize how terrible to books were.,flicks,coitor2,3,t5_2uiee

3112492,0,t1_cokdfr4,Yeah I feel like there are a lot of movies I have to go back and rewatch because I didnt get or was ready when I first watched them. Film like Eyes Wide Shut A Clockwork Orange Videodrome and Natural Born Killers I think were just too extreme or their meanings and themes hidden beneath what I thought was just an excuse for sex or violence for me to warm up to on my first viewing. Its take me a long time to even entertain the idea of watching them again.But there are some cases where watching a film too soon isnt actually a bad thing. For example I watched Taxi Driver about five years ago thought it was good but I much preferred a Scorsese film like Goodfellas or The Departed to it. But then a year passed and I just had this nagging urge to rewatch it. So I did and thats when it finally clicked.

3149929,0,t1_cooek40,Gravity was no more sophisticated than an actiondisaster movie should have been. Its simplistic premise lends itself to the primordial deathdefying visuals. In other words the literary content is not the point.It was amusing to me to see how many people praised Interstellar specifically for being better than Gravity because it was more than Gravity. But I didnt find that higher density of content to be any good which means more is less on a movie like Interstellar.Birdman is smack in the middle of that formcontent axis. It has more going on in it than Gravity but what it doesnt seem to understand is that better art takes away what is not needed. Its not an action movie like Gravity so it doesnt have much action  thats good. But it also spends a lot of time developing characters that dont matter and trying to make Riggan relatable and so on rather than evaluate its own core concepts of mental illness artistic distress and wanting your lifes work to be both worthwhile and recognized. It throws this stuff up into the movie but doesnt say much interesting about it. Also much as many have argued to the contrary I just do not see how the fake long take adds to the film.

Otherwise its going to feature Tomboy protagonist tough girl. Stupid references to the previous films. Pointless cameos that serve little to advance the plot Cold sadistic female authority figure type villain plenty of recent scifi feature this archetype.  Likely portrayed by Brienne of Tarths actress. Corny dialogue Theres been an awakening. Have you felt it? The Dark side and the Light....thats just corny writing right there.  Even the prequels avoided using something like The light side.  Stating something like that makes it so black and white and uninteresting. The new cast.  They look like they come off an ABC sitcom or the Disney channel.  Clean cut smooth features....looks like prep school types rather than farmboyssoldiersetc.  Contrast this with Luke and even Anakin who always looked like they were emotionally hurt or out of place and wanting to do more.  I attribute this to Lucas Kurosawa influence.  Abrams and Disney dont have that.  They want a soap opera...and not a space opera.Disney also means....pointless loverelationships...and not the enjoyable rivalry kind hinted between HanLeiaLandoLuke.Good battle scenes.

Each of those films is crammed with about as much worldbuilding and fanservice as is cinematically possible and each one still manages to tell a selfcontained compelling story that at least for the second two builds on the tension and stakes of the previous film. Marvel has the opportunity to craft an equally epic saga with only the Avengers megamovies not to mention all of the tieins one of the best parts about Daredevil was that its overarching plot was caused by the first Avengers picture but shamefully little is made of it and simply doesnt seem interested in anything beyond constant references to other properties. The first Avengers movies established huge stakes and Tony Stark even uses the alien menace as motivation for creating Ultron but then the film devolves into a carboncopy of the first with a slightly different villain and final boss stage.The stinger with Thanos is an insult.

4465539,0,t3_3c7hnr,Runaway  Kanye West West transcribes and catalysts the fusation of white and black culture into a masterpiece that transcends time. It pervades through the rampant misogyny of the jock respiratory system of the Millar disappointment Mad Max Fury Road although a far more apt title would be Mediocre Road and offers a true balance to the sexual politicizing of all modern culture. West effectively criticizes the use and disuse of CGI forced love stories and sequel baiting in Jewish blockbusters since Griffiths Birth of a Nation. Take par example the drumpad shown prominently during the song Power a song that shows West as a true st Century Schizoid Man rather than the hipster pretension of King Crimsons faroffthemark dystopian predictions. It is the cinematographical focus of the scene despite the fact that the twisting of violins can be prominently heard during the song something that is thematically absent from the studio version on the album. Ordinarily rap music videos would obscure this instrument to preserve the image of hardworking soul musicians who make music that conveys assloads and shittons of philosophicalsociobio meaning and message rather than amateurs who pick and prod on the elitist conformitysetting buttons of a perfectly symmetrical and therefore ultimately disgustingly Kubrickian machine. By doing this West manages to elevate computers as a true instrument of art in a way that no internet artist has before or since  thus extrapolating the connection between machines and class ical art in a way that embarasses the brainwashing mechanisms of one Neil CieCieRega It is no exaggeration to say that West is a modernday Godard although without the vulgar pretensions of the John French poliety at the hands of being oppressed for countless centuries by the monarchy of the great Queensland I am talking about the country of Great Britain do you read me its what the juveniles of today call England and no it is not slick or cleeky as the modern day children say in their postmodern parlance. In startling Conclusion West successfully twists the American psyche in ways that were attempted by the mediocre swishyswashing of P.T. Andersons rape of American culture The Master and the garrulous garbage of Captain Beefhearts although really the brainchild of the countlessly cynical Frank Zappa also known as the weedsmoking giant or even The GrAnD nigga profoundless attack and rampage on good olefashioned Christian religion known colloquially as Trout Mask Replica. Perhaps if Beefheart had called his album of surreal pseudomysteries Beef Fart Rammoogjacah back in the despicable abortionpermitting year of  he would have managed to create a true magnum opus and horsdoeurve like Run Away.Overall   IGN Club a great bit of mindless fun for the whole family,flicks,cstk4dc,4,t5_2uiee

5030489,0,t3_3jrgu4,To me the type of villainous entity doesnt really matter. Theres a couple of things that matter to me more Good makeup. While there are some exceptions to this rule I really appreciate villains to be well designed so if they appear in frame I get tense purely from their appearance. Lore. I like context for what is happening. Blair Witch did this extremely well. The information gained at the beginning plays into the entire movie especially the final shot. I personally find it scarier when I somehow know what can happen. Again there are exceptions mostly through design Alien. Actors who take their roles seriously. Spending some cash on actors is necessary because I can only buy into whats happening if the actors can sell me on it. Thats why Insidious benefitted so much from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne. Something at stake. This usually ties in with characters. I dont need a lot of character development but I need someone to latch onto and empathise with. Ethan Hawke in Sinister did a good job. While not necessarily  likeable I wanted to see him get through. Paranormal Activity is an example where this failed.

5104774,0,t3_3kwlj0,The Judge  d. David Dobkin I liked this its a decent drama.  Its nice to see Robert Downey Jr. outside the world of fantasy again this movie emphasizes his lightningquick wit there are several lines that seem like they just came out of Downeys mouth versus someone writing them for him to recite while having him demonstrate a bit though not enough for me of vulnerability.  He holds the screen well amid a mediumsized cast which includes Vincent DOnofrio who has a good chemistry with Downey.  Robert Duvall gets as much room as Downey to stretch out amp hes mostly enjoyable as the crotchety tough old dad.  There are some heavy themes revolving around family aging reconciling with the past amp forgiveness all of which are at least serviceably presented. I liked watching this movie but maybe its not particularly memorable theres not a whole lot of detail that Im able to recall even a week after watching it.  Balthazar Getty pops up in a very small role I recognized him but could not recall his name amp had to look him up.    The OH in Ohio  d. Billy Kent Parker Posey amp Paul Rudd a dream team in theory star as a married couple who drift apart although they are not very interested in each other to begin with due in part to Poseys Priscillas inability to have an orgasm.  Its a wouldbe wacky premise that falls flat from the start.  The movie is two parts broad comedy one part romantic comedy amp it doesnt add up to anything good.  Rudds Jack is a high school teacher who begins dating a sexually potent student while Priscilla goes shopping for a dildo.  Danny DeVito as a local swimming pool magnate enters into Priscillas life eventually which makes for a very odd but still kind of sweet couple of scenes.Posey Rudd amp DeVito are mostly enjoyable its the writing thats way off in this.  Posey winds up in many scenes where I cant tell what the hell she is supposed to be conveying amp cowriterdirector Kent puts her in some very awkward scenes where masturbation amp sexuality are played for laughs badly.  Rudds character is mostly a douche I assume the movie keeps his character in the movie because Rudd was fresh off Anchorman amp The YearOld Virgin.  Juggling the two characters proves to be clunky amp the attempts at laughs which are unrelenting are even clunkier.    Mommy  d. Xavier Dolan A powerhouse unblinking look at living with a mentally unstable family member from the perspective of Anne Dorvals Diane the single mother to Antoine OlivierPilons Steve a disturbed teenage boy who has grown to an age that is difficult for any parent but Steve is at an age where he is a physical threat to her amp anyone who is around when he loses control.  Whats so amazing about this movie is that Steves mother Diane is much more than just a quivering lip or sobbing blob of fear amp melancholy.  Diane is a spark of life a fortysomething who never really grew up herself.  Its a very rare type of character amp shes fascinating to watch.  Dianes indomitable spirit is kept in tiptop shape by Steves behavior which wildly swings around from abusive to obnoxious to embarrassing to childish to vulnerable.  Diane keeps Steve in check often by throwing her own crassness at him amp the balance is perilous amp fascinating to watch.  The acting all around is amazing.  This would all make for a unique very potent movie which looks great the camera is tight amp tense when it needs to be amp loosens its grip just enough with more stylish shots amp solid music cues but things get even more dense when Diane inadvertently befriends her new neighbor Kyla played by Suzanne Clment.  The chemistry as the  characters spend time together is wildly unpredictable amp done in a way that felt authentic.  Again the acting is mesmerizing in this amp Steves incessant hyperactivity amp the lurking malice of his illness are highly effective.  The two women in this movie are among the most fantastic female movie roles Ive ever seen the writing amp realization on the screen are electric.    Black Sea  d. Kevin Macdonald Jude Queens English Law stars as the bluest of bluecollar types the workingclassiest of workingclass characters.  His character Robinson is introduced in the artfully unshaven leering flesh as hes fired from his submarine job Robinson has been running submarines for  years by The Man.  Cut to Robinson at The Pub his hangout when hes not fondling paper photographs of the beautiful wife amp son who left him a dirty affair where he sits at a table with his coworkers  friends amp they commiserate on how much The Man sucks an actual line that Law has They fired me. They fired men like flushing shit down a toilet. Well... this time the shit is fighting back.  Amazing.  A treasure hunt is introduced for which Robinson must assemble a submarine crew restore an old vessel amp journey to the Black Sea to recover a storied loot that has its origins in World War II which allows for a montage of Hitler amp Stalin during the opening titles to try to inject some importance into this actionthriller.Laws accent is distractingly thick in this amp the story dictates that half of the sub crew he assembles must be Russian the treasure loot is in Russian waters so somehow that means he has to populate his sub with people that he cannot communicate with amp together that meant I had to rely on subtitles for chunks of the movie because I could hardly understand anyone.  Theres no shortage of action movie tropes that get crammed into the sub along with the crew but I didnt mind too much.  One of the crew members sounds very much like Keith Richards which was unintentionally distracting amp amusing for me.The production design amp editing are decent enough that I could still mostly get into the movie enough to get some enjoyment but the treachery on board the sub often feels forced.  I disliked the cast of characters enough that when the mission gets to its most dire moments of which there are many I found myself thinking that they could all join King Neptune for eternity amp I wouldnt give a shit.    Blood Ties  d. Guillaume Canet  A gritty crimedrama set squarely in  Brooklyn amp man they lined the streets with dozens of vintage vehicles amp broke out the s hair amp wardrobe in spades.  It looks great but unfortunately the story amp characters are thin.  The movies minute running time is too much for the weak story to fill however the movie also chose to have a large cast filled with a noteworthy list of faces Clive Owen amp Billy Crudup in the leads with Mila Kunis Lili Taylor Noah Emmerich James Caan Domenick Lombardozzi Marion Cotillard Zoe Saldana amp Griffin Dunne !!....? popping up throughout new characters were still showing up more than a halfhour into the movie when it already felt like it was spinning its wheels.In a nutshell I just didnt buy Clive Owen as a Brooklyn excon tuff n gruff guy.  Crudup who plays Owens brother amp who is also an NYPD detective is more solid but spends half of his screen time acting with his face amp posture rather than being given wellcrafted lines.  It starts to feel like a bad neonoir movie set in the dry hazy sunshine of s NYC rather than a shadowy rainy world of nighttime.  Ill give the movie points for its music soundtrack though its consistently engaging stylish amp really assists with the period vibe.  My one complaint is that the opening titles establish that its  amp a character is shown touching a needle to a record album amp Ace Frehleys New York Groove begins playing a record that was not released until . Apparently this is a remake of a French movie which was based on a French novel.  Somethings got lost along the way this movie like Owens confusing amp unconvincing excon character starts to feel like a lot of hot air.    ,flicks,cv1bdi3,5,t5_2uiee

Never a dull or wasted moment in the screenplay heightened by the dynamic between the three leads. Great to see Bogart doing edgier roles. The Wrestler dir. Darren Aronofsky   Yeah it is a little odd seeing how Aronofsky made two films so similar in such close succession with this and Black Swan. Has he ever touched on this in interviews? Not complaining though because I thought this was fantastic. I know absolutely nothing about wrestling so this was interesting to go into blind  it also makes me wonder how truthful this is as a portrayal of the things wrestlers have to go through and on the paradoxical social commentary that its fake etc. Aronofsky is the king of visceral cinema truly gutwrenching stuff. Black Swan is probably more interesting from a technical stylistic perspective but I preferred the performances and realism of this even though the actual character arc and message is very onthenose and overt. Just very well done cinema much like Requiem for a Dream in that regard. Very similar stories different nuances. Interesting to see them paired back to back though. .The Women dir.

Germany had a big movie industry in until the nazis arrived and it hasnt been very important and prestigious since then. At least not compared to France. Spain has to my knowledge never been known for its sprawling film industry.Buuel has made many Spanish language movies most if not all in Mexico since he wasnt particularly welcome in Spain during Francos reign. During the s there was an avantgarde movement in Paris which Buuel fit in with together with his compatriot Dali. The time spent in Paris is likely why he returned to France from time to time in his career.Polanski probably left because of the bigger opportunities outside of the iron curtain but I dont know his precise reasons.Kieslowski made most of his movies in Poland or partially in Poland.

5653755,0,t1_cwxfkq7,I didnt mind American Hustle as much. The thing about it is that its about  as clever as it thinks it is but thats only because it thinks its supremely clever and not because its really that bad. All the shots of peoples hands the stopping the action to focus on the outfits and the styles and the times stuff like back stories for Adams and Bale all seemed a little shoehorned and unnecessary.But I think the saving grace that made the movie for me was the emotional weight lent to the characters by the performances. In three scenes especially all in the last actWhere Bale feels like a mouse caught in a trap. Hes finally off his high he realizes that this game hes playing is real and he has no idea how to pull this off. Amy Adams comforts him and gives him a pep talk and that was where I realized that they werent really cartoon characters they were just dressed up to be.In the bedroom scene with Jennifer Lawrence where she showed you that she wasnt playing cartoon stupid. She was genuinely stupid and she knew it all along and it frightened her. He never meant to hurt her and she never meant to hurt him she just didnt know what to do because she was incapable of thinking these things out. Theres a sort of sweet tragedy to a character who understands his or her limitations the way Lawrence hints at in that scene. In the bigger picture those hinted understood limitations opened my eyes to a seriousness in the film that was lurking there all along.Finally the scene where Bale confesses to Jeremy Renner. You see Renners characters world not only fall apart in the blink of an eye but be ripped away from him. Cruelly so it seems. Theres a confused innocence in his portrayal that speaks to something real something human. And to see the betrayal in his eyes as he realizes what Bale has told him is something thats stayed with me.Also on a personal note I live for the moment where Bradley Cooper gets his. I hated Bradley Cooper then a holdover from Silver Linings and his character especially. It was satisfying to see bad guy bare his teeth and turn the screws on the heroes only to have it come back and bite him hard.So yeah I dont think its totally fair to call the movie totally emotionally empty. The emotional magnitude is just buried deep under a pile of style and notsoclever clevernesses.,flicks,cwxwjen,2,t5_2uiee

5753934,0,t3_3txs2b,Lancaster CA  Dir. by Mike Ott  A short film about a pathetic and kind of disturbing  something man. The main character was so odd that it made me want to know more about him and thats what the film did best. Other than that it was pretty mediocre. It seemed like a final student film project made by a guy who thinks he is way deeper than he is. In one of three scenes we see the main character talking to a friend I guess and the camera will randomly pan over to show the profile of the friend but never reveal anything about him. Whats the point? I dont know there were some nice shots but I think sometimes Mubi is so desperate for content that go for short artsy and experimental films that arent too great. The Seven Year Itch  Dir. by Billy Wilder  A great film with very controversial sexual politics. The whole film takes on the playboy mentality of an innocent girl next door type that is sexually liberal yet not intimidating to the man because sex is for the man not the woman. Although Monroes character isnt really attracted to Sherman she is basically reduced to an object of desire and is blamed for all of his mishaps. The film also appeals to the nice guy mentality which I always thought was a modern concept. Monroes character is quite literally reduced to her sexuality she has no name not much of a backstory while everyone lusts after her and is always dressed provocatively. Its quite a compelling film and is extremely well made even though its politics are quite dated. What I found most hilarious is that even though the Girl is dependent on Sherman she seemingly turns him into a bumbling idiot showing how she actually does have power over him. Brick  Dir. by Rian Johnson  A cool concept that felt a bit gimmicky but worked? I could definitely see how it strived to be a modern noir but theres something about films relying on other films thats offputting. At times it seemed unoriginal. Aside from those few problems it was overall compelling and well shot. The sound design was pretty great. There was some overcheesy acting but that happens when you cant get superstar actors. It was for sure a great effort from a first time director. .Almost Famous  Dir. by Cameron Crowe  This film was an unrealistic fantasy filled with child like wonder. It was hard to get into all the crazy things that were happening but the film sucked me in and I loved it. Its got a chill vibe that is still fast paced and entertaining. Its hilarious sad and wonderful. The story is just so exciting to watch unfold. To be honest I was so wrapped up in it I simply forgot to notice the details of cinematography editing sound and so on. Just delightful. .Rush Hour  Dir. by Bret Ratner  Brings back a lot of nostalgia. My dad loved Jackie Chan as a kid probably because they are very similar. I know this movie isnt great and kind of offensive at times but its still hilarious and fun to me. I prefer it to a lot of movies that people say it ripped off. Maybe its like the Beverly Hills Cop or Big Trouble in Little China of my generation. I connected with it a lot more than those two. Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street  Dir. by Tim Burton  Probably one of the better films Tim Burton has put out in the past  years. Exciting entertaining and visually great.

I felt that with the first Iron Man Captain America Winter Soldier and at times with The Avengers the first one The Incredible Hulk and Guardians of the Galaxy. Theyre not perfect movies especially not these last  but they are what we should at least expect from this studio. AntMan was just a disappointment for me.

There is a reveal with Stewarts character that gives her a really great opportunity to show her dramatic chops and she really crushed it. Enough with the Twilight jokes the woman can act.I thought the central conceit was novel and pretty fun.

5984643,0,t3_3x9fes,Ok before I get into my review please dont downvote me into oblivion because its negative...Im a big Star Wars fan and this movie really let me down.First I was nervous about this film since I heard JJ Abrams would be writing and directing.  He has never made a film I really liked although I enjoyed Star Trek as an average action flick I can understand that fans were upset by his version of Trek though. This film confirmed everything I was worried about  a complete JJization of Star Wars.  The camera is constantly moving we get a few lens flairs in the entire thing is really just an action flick moving from set piece to set piece.  He doesnt know how to handle tone very well or you get truly invested in a character.I liked the new actors but I didnt care about any of their situations.  The script didnt handle their stories very well and there were too many protagonists  I know we were supposed to focus on Rey but the movie didnt really focus on her that much.The Death Star . was pretty insulting to us as an audience as was the constant Star Wars callbacks  a desert planet! an ice planet! a cantina scene! a lightsaber stuck in the snow getting pulled out by the force!  It reminded me a lot of Jurassic World in this way.The story is forgettable and somehow the back story sounded a lot more interesting and I think that this story shouldve begun with a look at a crumbling Republic and the crumbling relationships of our main trio while also introducing us to the new cast.  Instead the opening crawl tells us that for whatever reason the Empire is back but its called the First Order and the Rebellion is back even though they already run things so its just a fringe movement called the Resistance funded by the Republic...pretty lazy writing if you ask me.Kylo Ren...weve seen an angsty teen flirting with the dark side before and it wasnt fun.  Im not sure how much fun it was here.  It bugs me that the movie kept bringing back props that shouldnt be in the film  how did Maz get Lukes lightsaber from Cloud City? how did Kylo Ren find Darth Vaders mask?  There were lazy screenwriting coincidences galore randomly running into Han finding the lightsaber etc.To top it off none of this felt like Star Wars.  John Williams even phoned it in or else he didnt see much to really respond to in the story.  The score was blah the story was blah JJ Abrams style doesnt fit Star Wars.Was it prequel level bad?  No but it wasnt good.  It was the Marvel version of Star Wars  massive set pieces tons of explosions wise cracking heroes everything played safe and future episodes teased so were all primed to spend more  in two years.Fuck you JJ and fuck you Disney.  You got me excited and you gave me a fast food version of Star Wars.  The OT was a pretty magical story that captured our imagination and inspired us simply creating a new movie with our favorite props and sound effects doesnt recreate that experience automatically.

Like Darth Vader being Lukes father and what not?The whole difference with ANH is that it set up the possibility for sequels but does well as a standalone because no one knew if there would be sequels or not.

Thats how I feel about most of Inarritu films aside from I guess Biutiful he seems like a director that has a very equationlike process when making movies rather than coming off as genuine.

As a big fan of James Bond I know its entirely possible to have the same character played by different actors at different times in that characters life and maintain the essence of said character but I simply cant see how anyone can build upon the performances that Harrison Ford has already contributed. I predict that this prequel will either feature a performance which is a pale but obvious imitation of Fords Han Solo or will go too far in the other direction and make the character completely different in the ongoing pursuit by Hollywood of dark gritty origin stories.,flicks,cywc76m,30,t5_2uiee

6333139,0,t1_cz8pdx1,As erm for lack of a better term optimistic as your predictions are youre missing one key ingredient. A viable alternative. The reason Netflix hasnt taken over the world is because despite what Reddit wants people to believe it isnt a viable model for an entire industry. One company cant hold up the industry at a flat monthly rate and no one wants to start subscribing to  different streaming services and no one wants to watch ads for everything. In a nutshell people cant monetize the internet. Its a problem and it sucks but straight up we dont want to pay money for the content we witness. If you really think about it how much did it cost to make the OC that you see on the Reddit front page say on a daily basis? How much is it still costing to host that content? Then ask yourself what would happen if the owners of Reddit tried to make each user pay for the website based on the costs of the OC you see on Reddit? All the content creators get their dues and in fact are encouraged to work harder on their content to get more money. Hell you even alleviate the Eternal September effect by encouraging people to post higher quality things in general on the website.Ill tell you what. Mass riots and an exodus not seen since the likes of Digg. Id probably be right there with them. Because we expect the internet to be free and we havent reached a point where were truly comfortable with paying for things online not to a point where an industry the size of the movie business or the tv business could be comfortably supported.Thats why Netflix has so many problems with getting a decent library why its putting so many eggs into the basket that is original programming. Because Netflix cant hold up the industry and it needs something to draw in people that isnt the prospect of being able to stream their favorite tv shows.Im not sure how that problem can be solved but until it is solved there wont be this cataclysmic shift that all the critics of the big Hollywood studio event film model keep predicting. ,flicks,cz9ibd2,2,t5_2uiee

6348759,0,t1_czb9mtt,I love National Treasure. I honestly believe Nic Cage should have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance or at the very least a Golden Globe for Best Actor  Comedy or Musical. That he wasnt demonstrates the snootiness of those organization. He immersed himself so completely and in such a thankless role with a passion that recalls the commitment of Hollywoods greatest method actors like Marilyn Monroe Marlon Brando Monty Clift and Eli Wallach. No matter what he does I think hes incapable of delivering a horrid performance. Hes in horrible movies a lot sure! But do not denigrate the master actor for his paltry decisions.I think it is one of the great action flicks of the s. Its engaging from start to finish the filmmakers playing a perverse game with the audience to see if they will follow Nic Cage and his merry band of conspiracy pranksters to the ends of the earth. Sure enough we do. It has this marvelous ballsiness in its dontgiveashit attitude towards believability continuity and organic plot development. Instead we hippityhop towards one exotic American locale to the next in search of an elusive treasure were not sure even exists. And director Jon Turteltaub keeps us guessing til the very end of the picture whether there even is a treasure or not. But like all great yarns its not about the destination. Its about the journey. And National Treasures journey is guaranteed to provide dynamite Hollywood entertainment to diverse segments of the population. yearold kids will love it. Pretentious cinephiles who say John Fords best movie was Wee Willie Winkie or  Women will love it. Drunken college kids playing beer pong while the One True Gods voice bleets hazily in the background will love it.Take note Hollywood NT is how you inject freshness into the formulaic action flick. Nevermind the fact that its chase sequences are derivative of ones youve seen done a million times better in a million other movies. What matters and what lingers in the mind long after the movie is over is the context of those chase sequences They actually think that by following a series of extraordinarily esoteric clues hiding in plain sight on U.S. currency and pirate ships they will happen upon the worlds greatest treasure booty.

6348924,0,t3_42l84o,XPost from rtruefilmI watched all of these for the first time. I almost never review films so it may be hard to read. Still not sure about the scores but eh.In Your Eyes Brin Hill Watched it because of my big crush on Zoe Kezan.Interesting concept but it still felt a bit flat to me. Whedon had a world of possibilities but somehow manages to be very predictable.It was entertaining for sure but I definitely wouldnt watch it again.Maybe Im just not very big on romcoms or maybe having watched Sense before took all the fun out of this for me. Ex Machina Alex Garland  One of my favourites of . Ive always been very interesed on AI and this movie makes some excellent points about it.How far can should we take AI? Great performances loved Oscar Isaac.Could have been  minutes shorter. .The Big Short Adam McKay  Wow. I certainly was not expecting that. I went in having heard great things about it but I didnt really know anything else about it.The editing really got me hooked though I feel it exceeded a little bit. The fourth wall breaks and meta commentary were very well done and necessary due to the fast pacing and complicated subject it deals with.Great cast everyone gave a wonderful performance though I feel Bale and Gosling were underused.I dont know if I was supposed to but I never got emotionally attached to any of the characters. The scene where Carrell finally opens up about his brothers suicide did nothing for me.I read some complaints that said it glorified people betting against the country but I dont think it did.It was very entertaining and informative at the same time but you obviously shouldnt take it as your main source of information about this event. The End of the Tour James Ponsoldt  Didnt read anything by DFW or know about his persona Im not from the US but it really got me interesed in reading some of his books.I cant tell if the real DFW was really like his character here but Segels performance is formidable as it has been said by many already.Its amazing how much I liked it given it was basically just a long conversation.I didnt really enjoy the conflict between the two main characters. Id say despite the poor story or lack thereof it still manages to come up with great dialogs. .Rocky John G. Avildsen One of those films I had to watch. Its difficult saying anything about it these iconic movies are just watched in a different way.Ill just say it was very fun and I look forward to watching the Rocky series. Nymphomaniac Vol. II Directors CutLars von Trier This second part had some of the more brutal chapters The BDSM the abortion but I believe it was less interesting than the first part.The commentary that Seligman made about Joes story was reduced and definitely weaker as Joes character itself mentions. The actress change seemed very awkward.I mean in three years she totally changed but Jerme was still being played by Shia.I know the ending was supposed to give some sort of deep message and I read about various interpretations and agree with some of thembut I found myself very dissatisfied with it it just felt cheap and totally contrary to Joes character. .The Third Man Carol Reed Last week I read the novella that was originally written as preparation for the screenplay and decided to watch the film last night.I found the movie to be fantastic the acting was on point and the cinematography perfectly conveyed the right mood for the story. The dialog was very sharp.The story itself and the pacing have some flaws but I think overall they work fine. My only real complaint is the score.It sounded like it belonged to a comedy contrary to the noir aspect the rest of the film had. .,flicks,czbavt5,7,t5_2uiee

6377710,0,t3_4308xz,Im reminded of my first creative writing teacher describing the difference between tone and mood which most in the class thought were interchangeable  The writer sets the tone the mood is what the audience feels.  You cant control the mood and its what the audience will tell everyone about.Put simply theres only so much in your control as an author. Something you may love as symbolism can feel empty and therefore pretentious to a viewer.  They will be influenced by a fierce amount beyond your control.Perhaps a better way to think about this is by effect on the audience.  Im a director and Ive long felt that Id rather a viewer hate my film than feel nothing when leaving the theatre.  Id rather affect every member of the audience palpably even if this risks alienating some or perhaps many of them then play it safe and provide some pablum that will temporarily satisfy the audience by virtue of its unobjectionableness and never last with them.So do the work that is moving for you.  You cant control if someone takes your symbolism as empty and frankly you should work towards being so effectual that those who dont get it hate it.  Because that means those who do get it are in your pocket for the long haul.  Just try to affect people. Leave the analysis to critics.,flicks,czekrck,7,t5_2uiee

Basically the main character is the sleaziest thing youll ever see. The movie starts with the main character having sex or raping I cant remember which one it was some Yakuza bosses girlfriend then he ends up killing both of them and he has to exit Hong Kong which leads to him going to Africa. The movie is nothing but him going around raping and murdering people. Eventually he rapes a corpse and gets Ebola this is like  minutes in to the movie goes back to his job at a restaurant and starts serving the customers Ebola burgers which are made of the people he kills? Im not sure if its supposed to be a horror comedy but its not really funny at all cause its so racist and disgusting. The only funny part is the end where the guy goes back to Hong Kong and just runs around vomiting on people.pretty much everything about the movie is just terrible aside the effects and I guess I have to give some credit to the lead actor. if you want to watch something disgusting and bad give it a go. fun fact same guy directed Ip Man ,flicks,czo28kd,20,t5_2uiee

6505103,0,t3_448a1p,Found footage can be done right it just usually isnt. I would imagine for a movie to be done right theyd have to change it up a little. Ask the question how is it relevant to the viewer? Everyone has cell phones everyone shoots  second videos every now and then. You can take this fact and use it to make a horror story by incorporating horror elements and having people shoot it with their phones. Problem is theirs no way theyd shoot a whole hour and a half movie. This takes relevance away and its something that most found footage filmmakers forgetignore. But just because theres a problem in the technique doesnt mean it cant be fixed. Film making is all about problem solving. We know how to make it relevant to the viewer cell phones so how do we make it full length? Well some try to do anthology VHS series REC series. This works because theyre short videos and its believable that people will be recording short snipits. But even that doesnt work all the way a lot of the shorts dont explain why their character is filming.Maniac did it where they showed a serial killer documenting his kills. This works because his reason for filming is clear he wants the videos for his own personal use. Now we have one way to explain a characters motivation this adds to the tone because we can understand the character and we are forced to live with it. So filming from a killers perspective is one way to do found footage and its something that I hope they capitalize on as the genre evolves. But theres still a problem how can filmmakers make a found footage movie where the victims motivation for shooting the movie is clear. Now obviously the Blair Witch Project was a documentary crew theres one way. But we cant just make another Blair Witch can we. So how can we do this? Unfriended attempted to make an entire movie from the perspective of a Skype chat its a new take on the genre. Boom you see? The genre like all genres is evolving. Yes theyll pump out crap but its not like it cant change. You could make a movie from the perspective of a news anchor on live television as weird stuff keeps happening around the city and the reporters. You could make a movie from the perspective of a dashcam. Theres room for the genre to grow.My point is you cant just write off a genre just because of its history even romantic comedies can be good. Every genre can be good. I just realized I used way too many words to say a very simple thing.,flicks,czs6d2v,2,t5_2uiee

Because Turners confessions of  were channeled through a white lawyer named Thomas Gray we can never know for certain who the real Nat Turner was. All historians can hope for is the nuggets in the Confessions which can sound like Nat nuggets which are few and far between. This gives artists a plethora of material to work with to reshape reclaim and refashion Nat Turner to serve their own desires. But this also means that we can never understand Nat Turner from a truly historiographical pointofview. Thus Nat Turner A Troublesome Property becomes a brilliant investigation on the shortcomings of historical interpretation of artistic license best seen through its extended treatment of William Styrons controversial fictional novel The Confessions of Nat Turner and of the blur between reality and fiction in representation. Burnett interviews a slew of fascinating folks who give their insights into how they interpret Nat Turner. All have equally legitimate claims. All have points where they easily contradict one another. All have moments where we disagree with them based on what someone after them says. No one is ever more right and Burnett keeps the proceedings electrically objective and still Wisemanly subjective.This is necessary viewing for anyone who wants to know more about Americas history of slavery which I assume includes every thinkinglivingbreathing American.I would also recommend watching this AND reading Kenneth Greenbergs excellently compiled The Confessions of Nat Turner and Other Documents before tackling the upcoming behemoth of  independent cinema Nate Parkers The Birth of a Nation. Burnetts documentary and Greenbergs anthology give us important insights and interpretive lenses on how to best approach complex historical figures like Nat Turner where one cant separate the truth from the fiction.Elephant Gus Van Sant  No ratingThis is a film about a school shooting.This film in flux made me feel tense dirty numb hollow angry frightened stressed out of my mind repulsed at the shallow satire bulemic girls impatient repulsed at the tragic satire uglyduckling girls fearful for my life fearful for the lives of my friends fearful for the lives of everyone at work awestruck annoyed at its obvious commentary homosexual urges video games and Nazi documentarypathologic sociopaths fuck off Gus intrigued by its lessobvious commentary the connection with that scene to a previous one where GSA highschoolstudents get into a debate over whether you can tell when someone is gay by their appearance you got something going there Gus enlightened how will we know what they were thinking of?

Never once did I feel bored.Thus it is a bold work of art.The Women George Cukor  Plot twist its actually all about men!A very unusual filmnot a single male actor ever appears. Its a story by protofeminist director George Cukor that uses women as both satiric vessel and empathetic beings. Its sweet touching often times acerbic and acidic but always a pleasure to watch. Rosalind Russells performance especially brings the house down. Cukor attacks fashion high society and the perceived pettiness of the leisure class but he also propels women to a position of immense personal power and intelligence. His prowoman direction is sensitive daring for its time and a blast to discover today.Bridges Go Round Shirley Clarke  No ratingLike most people including the diehard American independent cinephiles who can wax lyrical about Mekas M. Deren the Cass and Brakhage I am woefully underinformed on the cinema of Shirley Clarke. She was an American independent filmmaker who was famous in spurts in her life but reached neither the inlife fame nor the postlife deification of the aforementioned directors. Were only NOW just beginning to see what a brilliant shrewd endlessly fascinating figure she was.Here Clarke shoots hypnotic footage of the  Brussels World Expo. The film only  minutes in length is repeated twiceeach time with different music. The first time we hear the soothinghaunting sax stylings of Teo Macero the second time we hear the dystopian bleepbloops of electronic composers Bebe amp Louis Marron The Forbidden Planet . City symphony and city nightmare. Clarke an adament musicphile reminds us how much scores matter to establishing tone rhythm and synchronicity. The unforgettable Portrait of Jason as well as this promising early documentary short make me excited to delve further into Clarkes freejazz cinema.Whats Up Tiger Lily?

Fanboy claptrap is a perfect description of Tarantinos postJackie Brown nonsense. gt In a Quentin Tarantino film everyone sounds like Quentin Tarantino. Absolutely fantastic.Anyway Tarantino has that problem where he keeps paying homage to classic films and old genres and movements but he doesnt actually do anything with those inspirations of his so much as just say hee hee hee look at me I can reference old movies!. He seems more concerned with how much he can show off his film nerdiness than actually making a great film. Its really disappointing because his first three films were beyond incredible but since then hes just sank into this annoying selfindulgent mess. gt Spike Jonze isnt typically a writer.He did win an Oscar for it though haha. Hes certainly more of a director than a writer but I wouldnt discount his writing. I didnt even know there was a documentary on Woody Allen. Its on Netflix Ill have to check it out. I know Allens pretty shady  not exactly on a Polanski level but still  but its hard for me not to respect his dedication to his craft. Of course I also still have respect for Polanski so maybe Im just a shitty person. Oh yeah and speaking of Kermode ever seen his review of Film Socialisme Its gotta be one of my favourite reviews hes ever done.

7551704,0,t3_4ijguc,The Amityville Horror Director Stuart RosenbergDOP Fred J. KoenekampThe number one sin that a horror film can commit is failing to be scary  and The Amityville Horror unfortunately commits this sin. Its a predictable and drab affair concerning the new inhabitants of a house where the previous occupants were murdered by the father of the family who then killed himself. The house is on the market for cheap and is snapped up by George and Kathy two Catholics who have three children. Strange happenings ensue with the priest who has been asked to bless the house encountering a room full of flies whispers in the air telling him to get out sickness blistering palms and a host of other issues which stop him from blessing the house. Surprise surprise its the house itself which is haunted. The Amityville Horror might be one of the earliest films I know it isnt the earliest to feature the Indian burial ground trope and it adds on a helping of satanic worship to seal the deal. The acting is wooden the film itself is dreary and just drones on and on with not much of anything happening. The tension is nonexistent but that doesnt stop the film from believing it has some and the whole thing just isnt scary at all. The score is great though and Lalo Schifrin was nominated for an oscar for it but it just cant save this lowgrade lowbudget horror which sets the bar very low for the multitude of films that came after it of which Ive seen none.James Brolins acting is okay but the performances as a whole havent aged well and coupled with the stodgy cinematography it makes it difficult to get through. stars.Triangle  Director Christopher SmithDOP Robert HumphreysThis is a lowbudget British horror which gets a fair heap of praise on Reddit which is why I decided to check it out. A single mother Jess with a difficulttolookafter autistic son Tommy heads down to the harbour to take a trip with her friend Greg his close friend Victor who helps out with steering the boat Sally and Downey who are married friends of Gregs and their friend Heather who Sally hopes to set up with Greg. Tommy is mysteriously missing from the group and Jess seems disorientated and confused. They depart and disaster strikes as they encounter a strange and mysterious storm which capsizes the boat and leaves them stranded on top of the upturned boat with Heather going missing during all the commotion. What follows is a timetravelesque psychological thriller with a twinge of horror in which Jess and the audience are swept along through a physical representation of what seems to be hell. The film keeps you guessing the entire time and the director does very well to keep the audience at an arms length but not completely alienate them from whats going on. I think its a film that would do well with a second viewing but it manages to wrap up the story nicely and in a way which seems at least of the surface to make sense.The cinematography is nice and fluid and is helped immensely by the great performance of the lead actress. The film certainly has a lowbudget feel at times with the CGI looking shaky at times but overall its a tight smart thriller. One characters arc is never completely resolved and the film suffers for that whatif? coming from the audience but this is counteracted by some great visual images that were treated to.A nice lowbudget horrorpsychologicalthriller. It didnt astound me but it kept my attention and my thoughts stayed with it for some of the afternoon afterwards.. stars.The Big Short  Director Adam McKayDOP Barry AckroydWhat a refreshing film this was. I really thought Id be in for a traditionally structured Hollywood ensemblefilm about a the  market crash but was pleasantly surprised by this rich original and wonderfully directed film. I had no clue what to expect going in but was pleasantly surprised that the film managed to tread the line between condemning the actions that lead to the crash whilst also semicelebrating blackly the ingenuity of those who profited off of it. Its this moral quandary which lies at the heart of this film and its wonderfully realised by performances from Steve Carrell Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling in particular. Brad Pitt plays an excellent supporting role but his character isnt as captivating as the others because he isnt as conflicted as them.The fourth wall breaks selfaware scenes of celebrities explaining the fundamentals of the housing market and what lead to the crash and the at times disorientating editing all combine to make this postmodern take on a difficult dense and infuriatingly unfair series of events absolutely captivating. The film shows us that the people involved in this disaster were crooks and the crash itself was a massive conjob caused by reckless bankers gaming the system and it really makes for some great cinema.The film stays grounded enough that we still believe the outlandish characters but manages to be genuinely funny at the same time as dealing with a difficult subject which could have easily alienated the audience.I really enjoyed this and Im very pleased that I did. I definitely think its going to need a rewatch or two especially to see Christian Bale and Steve Carrells phenomenal acting. starsOther films reviews to be added tomorrow as its very lateThe Hunger Games Mockingjay  Part DeadpoolSpotlightDirector DOP Director DOP ,flicks,d30lckq,2,t5_2uiee

Does it feel to anyone else that the people who only watch the show are extremely callous and inconsiderate when it comes to spoilers? Moments after a big moment happened in the show there are screenshots all over Facebook and then theres shit like Interview with actor X on their tragic death scene in Game of Thrones last night. I have a friend whos been trying to avoid the sixth season and after the episode I messaged him telling him to either tread extremely carefully or avoid the internet altogether. He heard plot points through a bloody news article completely unrelated to Game of Thrones. When you compare that to book readers who sat on massive secrets for several years. The latest book came out when she show was starting and I never saw anyone spoiling what would eventually happen at the end of season .

And if you want to watch something about reevaluating your life without being too deep and losing its entertainment value watch survival movies. They usually come with this message.

Alternatively it can in my opinion damage some films whereby no one is the good guy because just a blatant disregard for morals where instead of both sides thinking what they are dping is correct instead becomes I dont care so I will do whatever I want.

9039552,0,t1_d7wahdv,As much as I disagreed with you last week I completely agree with you on this one.Inglourious Basterds is easily Tarantinos best film in my opinion. The writing is superb  I absolutely adore the way he takes these separate chapters and diverse range of characters and weaves them all together in the end to form a completely satisfying ending. The dialogue as QT is known for is just delicious and there are some seriously compelling performances Waltz of course being the standout but hes not the only one who really brings it.Speaking of dialogue QT uses different languages to create a substantial amount of tension in the film. I remember hearing an interview from him something to the effect of writers pissing away tension because everyone speaks the same language in their films with similar subject matter. This is actually one of the bigger problems that I had with Where Eagles Dare  which is a fairly obvious influence for Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds.

If anything I think success with kids is becoming less of a guaranteed asset for animated films since there is so much alternative entertainment for that target audience that does not require work aside from parents paying for the internet and maybe a subscription for a streaming service and even if not theres always Youtube. Wellmarketed animated movies that can attract both adults and kids into theatre seats seem to be the exception now. Meanwhile Arrival is the kind of film that a is absolutely nothing like Trolls b looks good on a big screen c is appealing to a widerange of demographics and d would be hard to find an alternative to on Netflix.

9868496,0,t3_5glt2l,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them This was hyped as one of the better blockbusters of the year. Much to my surprise I actually found it to be one of the worst. It is also far and away the worst entry in the Harry Potter franchise. Aside from Foglers character who easily should have been the primary protagonist there isnt a single thing about this film that works. Its stunning how poorly written this film is with two separate plots that only meet out of sheer contrivance. The whole premise that Newts briefcase lets loose animals into the city? Not only does this plot end up having shockingly little stakes but it is resolved with  minutes left in the film and without any effect on Plot B. Whats worse is that any sense of magic that leaves you in awe is totally lost in this film. My eyes were starving for something anything that would make me go Whoa. And the characters again absent Fogler are totally bland and nondescript. It takes a ton of very good actors and makes them useless props for the camera. Just a totally dreadful film. Moana I liked this a lot. Has its share of storytelling flaws way too many conveniences a rushed redemption arc and an unnecessary destiny story but the emotion here is very palpable and effective. Found myself tearing up quite a bit. Ill also be singing the soundtrack for a while or at least until I get sick of it.La La Land Rewatch. I dont think Ill ever find this an unsuspecting masterpiece but I also dont think it needs to be. Chazelle is satisfied with merely making great movies that speak to the powerful currents cinema can employ and Im more than satisfied to love and enjoy a film like that. La La Land is the kind of mainstream adult film I wish got made more often One that isnt shy of being expressive and emotional.

My question is how?Film is a construct build upon many crafts. You can take a look at the scoring acting editing the cinematography camera movement and so on.I gotta take an easy example We can both agree that this shot from Citizen Kane is great can we? It is generally agreed that it is a well composed shot. You can find many discussions on why it is a great shot on the internet.gt You also say the scale differs from person to person. Doesnt that make it too subjective to have a truly objective classification?Movies are about emotion and sometimes something works for you but not for me. I think my TLDR is a great summary for my opinion Enjoyment is subjective discussion is objective. We can both come to the same conclusion when discussing a film with the difference that one of us just likes it better. The objectivity is being able to explain why you like it. I might not share your opinion but if you can explain it to me it is and objective opinion.Subjectivity is a discussion killer. Of course whether you like a movie or not depends on no one but yourself but you can find objective reasons for it. Subjectivity is the point where you just do not like something but cant pin down why. If you arent open for a discussion and say I dont like it because thats my opinion its not an opinion worth thinking about. If you can argue why you not like it but I do it becomes an objective discussion. It is still about the subjective enjoyment of something but in a objective way.,flicks,db77aow,1,t5_2uiee

He knows the people inside will die but he doesnt care.

Sadly High Noon is not amongst them so I wont know what youre talking about. Ive made a point to see it now. Youve piqued my curiosity. High Noon is one of the great westerns. The tension is built up really well helped in that regard by the ticking score and the nearrealtime pacing. I cant recommend it enough. Its also worthwhile to watch Rio Bravo fairly soon afterwards because theyre basically poltical opposites. Youll know what I mean afterwards  I dont want to spoil anything.gt Wallach wasnt as overthetop as youd like to think. That scene with his brother right after it he portrays a certain vulnerability that adds another dimension to his character. He does it without weeping crying or telling sentimental tales. Its all evident in his eyes. Eastwoods eyes give the impression that he recognises the vulnerability. Nothing in their conversation indicates any of this.

10758889,0,t1_ddpnqwy,I doubt it video game films are poisoned chalices every single one  regardless of budget has been terrible. In my opinion its because games are more immersive than films in the sense that you could spend  minutes doing practically nothing on a game and not be too bored while  minutes of nothing in a film feels like an age. ,flicks,ddpp7gw,11,t5_2uiee
10774525,0,t3_5u4dxi, The End of the Tour about David Foster Wallace is good. If you like comics at all I really love American Splendor about Harvey Pekar. The Crumb documentary is also amazing. Probably my favorite documentary of all time and easily my favorite soundtrack  Barfly about Bukowski. Micky Rourke is really what makes this movie worth watching for his portrayal of Bukowski And yeah I know he is a pretty good read but who would want to be such an asshole. The Rum Diaries and Fear and Loathing about character based on the author both played by Johnny Depp. I dont really care for Rum Diaries book and movie but it is weird how such similar movies could be so different.  Wonder Boys is pretty good. It is very roughly based on Michael Chabons experiences in college and friendship with Raymond Carver and other influences brought in as well. ,flicks,ddrbbza,8,t5_2uiee

As a huge De Palma fan who has seen almost his entire filmography I thought most of the stories were pretty well known it was all things I had already heard before. There couldve been more breathing room.I also wouldve loved some interviews with some actorscrew to hear other people weigh in on working with De Palma. I know it wasnt the docs intent but to not include those things feels like a miscalculation. ,flicks,de9voz5,3,t5_2uiee

11344888,0,t3_61s1w2,Drive  This is Nicolas Winding Refns best known film and has received a ton of positive praise so I finally got around to watching it this week. Ryan Gosling does a fantastic job at creating a timeless instantly magnetic character like the Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood did back in the day. Keeping on the McQueen vibe I felt that a lot of Bullitt was in this films DNA especially with the car chase in the valley  marvelously executed. The action however I feel sometimes got selfindulgent and overly stylized in that unfortunate way Winding Refn seems to do. Blood sprays skulls splinter hands are smashed it starts to appear as if the movie itself were reveling in it making it lose the power that cinematic violence has to entrance and captivate. I felt that Los Angeles as a setting was very well utilized. From the valley to the oceanside cliffs the film traces a violent shady path through the city and the characters it shelters in its nooks and crannies. The performances of Albert Brooks Ron Perlman and Bryan Cranston are also noteworthy but I felt Carey Mulligan never quite reached her characters potential. Overall a solid bloody thriller that will appeal to fans of the arthouse and grindhouse alike as well as those that like a good story and compelling characters to compliment the gore. Blue Ruin  Absolutely phenomenal. Serves as inspiration for any aspiring filmmaker demonstrating the power that even the simplest most primal stories can hold. Blue Ruin does something that I have never seen in any thriller film before not even revenge movies it focuses on what this kind of irrational pursuit of vengeance does to the people involved how normal human beings  people who shave get dressed go to work fill up the tank water the lawn  get caught and chewed up in the cycle of vengeful violence that can consume everything they care about. Its a simple brief film focusing on a drifter played to muted sadeyed perfection by Macon Blair who comes back to his hometown after his parents killer is released from prison. He sets off a tragedy that ranks with Shakespeares best work the destruction of two families in the most humanly flawed ways. The setting of rural Virginia is brought to life by Jeremy Saulniers who also wrote and directed expressive photography. There is not a single frame that goes to waste in this film  its a tough short and thoroughly brutal masterpiece that will sit in the pantheon of great American thrillers someday. . Chariots Of Fire  If you havent seen this film or even heard of it youve certainly heard it its where this  comes from. It tells the story of Harold Abrahams an English Jew and Eric Liddell a Scottish Christian who are also gifted runners that represent Great Britain at the  Olympic Games in Paris. The film focuses less on the rivalry between the two men than it does on the things that drive them Harold runs to prove himself to his country in the face of antiSemitic prejudice and Eric runs for the glory of God. These two motivations are mined to their deepest depths making a rousing cheerworthy film out of an otherwise mildly interesting footnote in Olympic history. The very s synthdriven score by Vangelis is a lovely break in tradition for period dramas and their orchestral arrangements and the cast all give fine performances especially the two leads who begin to give off a Biblical CainandAbel vibe as the film grows Ben Cross as Abrahams is the tortured unsatisfied young man hungering for the world to recognize his greatness and not his religion and Ian Charleson is a perfect little Abel the chosen son and pride of all who know him but who still strives to excel in the name of the God who favors him. A lovely moving film that is definitely worth a watch for fans of great acting and great period pieces and a mustwatch for fans of British cinema.  ,flicks,dfhx8o0,2,t5_2uiee

Im just going to settle with the fact that for whatever reason my guess is that you refuse to look at the film from other characters points of view you do not like this movie and youre just tossing in those vague buzzwords to justify it. ,flicks,dfj4u0d,8,t5_2uiee

Its a story about an isolated family haunted by the unknown a slow burner the focus is on the atmosphere and not on scary stuff or jump scares. Though that scene with the baby is just sick. The ending of the VVitch is in my opinion perfect. The family was haunted for the whole time there is no twist the witches are real.Yes the ending of The Shining is straight forward and there is no doubt about anything I just didnt like that ending that much I am a sucker for not so happy endings.,flicks,dfkpwa6,1,t5_2uiee
