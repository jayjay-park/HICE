2476337,0,t3_2nh1nt,I had an odd issue. I was playing the game exploring in the forest. I came across another player said hello and Goodbye. When I left the forest through the portal I ended up at another players home. I assume the player I met. Confused me for a minute as I thought my home had been reset. Once I realised I just left his home via esc so not a big bug.,skysaga,cmhslnq,1,t5_3304t

I think next time Il create a bit more hype in advance so that MORE people turn up and can ask questions. Either way last night was fantastic  ,skysaga,cmiqubu,1,t5_3304t

4654186,0,t3_3ep82g,Well Im not sure how many games of this type youve played...but it plays very similarly to Minecraft. Most things carry over pretty well. Ill give you a few things I learned along the wayLoot EVERYTHINGBuild a huge chest room on your home island and store literally everything you pick up. I cant tell you how many times Ive had to go back and farm xltSeemingly Useless Itemgt just to complete a quest or build an item. I dont think Ive run across any item yet that I didnt have some use for. I now have an expandable room that just has chests in it.MetalsWoods matterThe metal and wood you use to make any item in the game matters. The stats of the armorweapon are changed depending on the materials used. This is probably the best guide Ive found for metals. Use iron to craft everything that isnt armor or weapons...unless you want to change the color of the item.Farm often but in small quantitiesI used to spend large spans of time miningwood chopping to get materials. Now every time I jump out to a new place I spend a minute or two snagging some wood and any metal I see. I have more metals than I need and Im no longer spending huge amounts of time farming mindlesslyPvP times are strangeCurrently PvP is only open from PMAM Central. Nothing in the game will tell you this but its apparently in the patch notes. I dont know how much you enjoy PvP but its a lot of fun. Youll definitely see me in there.Daily Keystones are a thing. Do them.Youll eventually get a keystone that has a little durability bar at the bottom of the icon. It has a  hour time limit. Toyll get a new one in the mail every day. Make sure you do these because consecutive days will reward you with patterns and weapons being sent in the mail.Do your daily questsThere are  quest vendors.  of them are the Guild quests and one of them is a weekend quest giver located in the Explorers Guild. These are the best way to raise your rank and you can often buy patterns with the tokens they yield.I might have some more to add later but those might be the most important things I can think of off the top of my head. There are a bunch of little random oddities but youll figure them out. ,skysaga,cth7x4u,8,t5_3304t
7020575,0,t1_d1bsiae,It has been suggested many times and I am sure there will be some kind of trading system.  I cannot say whether it will be between players or through merchants. We will have to wait and see. ,skysaga,d1c4s6f,1,t5_3304t
