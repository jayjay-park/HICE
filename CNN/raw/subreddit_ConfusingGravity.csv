7728900,0,t3_4l5oxs,Okay I do not want to be a iamverysmart person here. But am I the only one that is not getting tricked here?Usually these things fuck with my head. But for some reason because you can see them in the foreground and in the reflection my brain just saw what was going on.Typically I am lost for atleast a few seconds. Is anyone else having this? I wonder why different visual cues work in different ways for different people. maybe I am overthinking this ,ConfusingGravity,d3kpz41,2,t5_3es13
