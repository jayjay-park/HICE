6809196,0,t1_d0o44c4,I posted my thoughts hereWe went the following night and we also preferred Frankies. Were heading back to Vegas for Viva Las Vegas next month. Frankies is on our first stops. If we make it to Golden Tiki itll be for a Painkiller and thats about it. ,Tiki,d0o4ald,1,t5_2s6od

8789660,0,t3_50hosw,I find it highly suspect that they included a spiced rum.,Tiki,d74ds3a,3,t5_2s6od

9320851,0,t3_581b1l,I would like to get started doing this myself. I have no actual experience but I suspect you may need to dry the wood out first to avoid warping and cracking. Best of luck! Hope you share the results! ,Tiki,d8xhinm,2,t5_2s6od
9550905,0,t3_5bp8kp,I was just on the big island on my own honeymoon a couple weeks ago.Its true that tiki is pretty scarce on Hawaii these days but we did luck into an excellent midcentury time capsulethe Royal Kona Hotel. The building itself is a sweeping bit of s cement resort architecture and the interior is covered with large wood tikis. And the bar and restaurant for the hotel is.....Don the Beachcomber?! It must be the very last of the old franchises. We didnt stay in the hotel but we did stop by the outdoor Mai Tai lounge where I got a flight of Mai Tais. Good luck and congratulations!,Tiki,d9qcgyl,5,t5_2s6od
9602934,0,t1_d9wknur,No we only have one decent tiki bar in the Milwaukee area and they dont throw many events. Come July Ill be more well versed in tiki and will totally partake!,Tiki,d9wrat9,2,t5_2s6od
9631897,0,t1_d9zkiad,Ill certainly agree with you on False Idol just FYI its next to CampC not above it.  I havent been to Grass Skirt yet but it certainly looks like it has potential.  Im on the fence about the Cat Eye Club.  They bill themselves as tiki and the drinks are pretty good but the decor is just too sunny and patio for my conception of what a good tiki bar should be.  I feel the same way about Fairweather  its an outdoor baseball bar that happens to serve good tiki drinks rather than a tiki bar per se.For some the good tiki drinks are what satisfies them.  For me Im looking for the full experience.  Each to their own!,Tiki,da0bv7x,1,t5_2s6od

9658332,0,t3_5d0d3s,Not odd really but it fell out of a book at a thrift store and was gifted to me. Its the only island Ive visited. I feel I was meant to have it.,Tiki,da3latv,2,t5_2s6od
9678419,0,t3_5di5yz,I think it might create a fleeting interest in Polynesian culture but not enough to truly make a splash in the tikisphere.Im definitely getting my ticket for Moana though.,Tiki,da62hkl,2,t5_2s6od
9856977,0,t1_dard2jh,Yes!,Tiki,dasdy3x,2,t5_2s6od
9864154,0,t1_dascim5,But if theyre charging more for aged rums that arent as aged as they say thats criminal and you should be furious. ,Tiki,datblku,3,t5_2s6od

10182317,0,t1_dby7onu,Strictly speaking no. But like a lot of other things theres enough leeway and overlap that a little pirate decoration wouldnt be totally out of place in a modern tiki bar.,Tiki,dby804b,3,t5_2s6od

10294389,0,t1_dcawyj1,I believe Plantation is pretty good about including the distilling method and age on the bottle.  Just look for one that says pot still. As for which geographic region it will really depend on what youre using it for but the younger pot still Plantations will be pretty much interchangeable in cocktails.EDIT The Plantation website also includes the distillation method in the descriptions of several of its rums.,Tiki,dcaxb2w,1,t5_2s6od
10402020,0,t3_5oypdd,I would suggest picking up the Smugglers Cove book if you havent already then pick  or  bottles from each category listed in the book.  ,Tiki,dcn4wc6,5,t5_2s6od

10918920,0,t1_de5yj2e,To build on uKeeperEUSCs great comments Plantation Original Dark is cheap but flavorful utility player.  I would not mix with the Mezan or Plantation Origin Guyana. OFTD can subwell and maybe better at times for LH.. Ask where you got Hamiltons Pimeto Dram if they can order the Hamiltons  or  Demerara. The Navy would be a great add as well. ,Tiki,de67k4l,2,t5_2s6od
11199649,0,t1_df1g27f,Man. While I cant I guess technically disagree with you on the flavors. Im going to push up my glasses and say that spiced rums didnt exist during the golden tiki era and usually they only spice a rum to hide its poor quality. Also you can totally taste it when you use the actual syrups and grated spices.,Tiki,df1gt07,2,t5_2s6od
11331178,0,t1_dfgbvsz,Awesome! Ill check it out on my next rum run!,Tiki,dfgdbyv,3,t5_2s6od
