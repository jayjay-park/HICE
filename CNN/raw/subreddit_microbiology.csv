It seems that most of the work that is being done is focused on finding life here on earth that seem to bend the rules when it comes to how they survive. Extremophilic microoganisms are what built this planet from the ground up  the better we know how they work the more evolutionary insight we may have when it comes to isolating just what it would take for life outside of our biome.Once we know what we are looking for we will find things that weve never imagined.This is just my opinion of course.

605456,0,t3_210qz8,The paper doesnt explain very clearly what the authors did but my guess is that static refers to the conditions in which the biofilm is formed i.e. in a static nonmoving liquid culture in contrast to within a flow cell or something like that. The biofilm inhibition part refers to the E. colis ability to prevent the formation of a biofilm by P.a. If they were looking at alreadyestablished biofilms it would be considered a biofilm dispersal or biofilm eradication assay or something similar. This part of the paper does not address their central goal of using the E. coli to eradicate preexisting biofilms but it at least suggests the E. coli would prevent new biofilms from forming.,microbiology,cg93dpa,2,t5_2qirk

1362806,0,t3_29o7hy,Some of these comments seem downright discouraging.  Its great to see someone interested so early!  You can get some really neat pictures with surprisingly cheap or even damaged microscopes even with simple stains. Stains allow you to see bacteria cells easier. Without them theyre basically translucent and hard to distinguish. You can order stains right off amazon if you want.  You could call around to area universities to see if they are getting rid of any old lab equipment. At least from my experience at my undergrad youd be surprised what they throw away.  You can even look on craigslist That one would probably suit your needs just fine. You dont really want too nice of one yet youre going to mess up sometimes everyone does. It may be hard to work with a used lowerend microscope but youll appreciate the better ones youll eventually use. You can point something as simple as an iphone camera through the eyepiece and capture fairly great shots.  Itll be difficult to utilize either the stains or the microscope without guidance so it may help you to recruit a biology teacher or someone knowledgeable.  If you cant do that you could use a microbiology lab manual off the internet to guide you.  This one is pretty introductory to lab practices If you dont like that one just google microbiology lab manuals. The lab manuals can explain what certain stains do how to do them and can give you a list to build your own minilaboratory.  I dunno if any of this is helpful but I encourage you to continue your curiosity.  You might also consider auditing a community college micro class so you dont have to worry about it on your transcript. Also check out your local library!

2335865,0,t1_cm0dcd9,You are correct that the flu spray administered is a live attenuated virus. The nature of attenuated viruses is that they lack the genetic code to produce functioning viral particles. An attenuated virus infects its target cell with the flu it is typically mucous producing cells lining the respiratory tract then starts expressing its genetic code within this cell. For a normal virus this includes replication of the viral genome as well as production of the virus protein shell along with some other very important proteins. When these pieces meet along with a number of others they form a functioning virus. With the attenuated virus it lacks the genetic information encoding replication of the viral genome and only codes for the outer protein shell. As such any cells infected with this attenuated strain will spread these shells the same as the recombinant injected vaccine allowing the immune system to recognize and build up immunity should the functioning virus come around.This attenuated strain is designed to work at lower than normal human temperature particularly the nasal passages as you stated.During localized inflammation along the blood brain barrier it is possible for it to become slightly more permeable than normal but this typically is associated with autoimmune conditions. And this permeability is only localized meaning one immune response in a separate area of the body will not necessarily lead to increased BBB permeability.It is extremely unlikely the brain would be at the temperature ideal for the attenuated virus to infect it without the rest of the body showing significant problems. Additionally the attenuated virus would have to cross multiple protective layers to reach the blood stream once reaching circulation hope to find a capillary ending near the CNS without first encountering an immune cell and hope it is leaky enough to get past the BBB. Then if it were to infect the brain tissue it would produce one cycle of protein shells and stop. It is not impossible but not at all likely.I do not have references handy largely because this info comes from my lectures and textbooks but I can share which ones we used if you would like.,microbiology,cm0fc0k,3,t5_2qirk
2347534,0,t1_cm0fc0k,Thanks again for sharing your knowledge. EditThey did find some white blood cells  I believe in his spinal tap but said it was within an acceptable range. Perhaps if the inflammation were localized to the cerebellum region then that would allow the virus through that area.  Perhaps then the strong immune response inadvertently destroys some of the axon tracts there?Is there any way to pinpoint which virus might have caused the ataxia?  I talked with his neurologist and pediatrician and they said they could look for antibodies but all it would show is that he was immunized.  Therefore they would only say his ataxia was a result of a virus but wouldnt attribute it to the vaccination.   I guess Im looking for evidence that would be more condemning that the vaccine was at fault then to say it was a virus generically.  I found a Netherland study abstract that showed ataxia resulted in  of Varicella Zoster immunizations.  There was a PubMed publications that contained a similar story of toddler girl that couldnt walk after an immunization but I would need to purchase the publication to read it further to find which immunization it was specificaly.

11130947,0,t1_deto07o,At this level dont worry too much about the E value.  You are correct the closer it is to zero the better the match.  Good enough.BLASTing your sequence turns up Pectobacterium carotovorum pretty much all the way through as your highest hits.,microbiology,detolfd,2,t5_2qirk

11296258,0,t1_dfbmrgj,Thank you very much! Since Im here now may I ask one more question? I hang my clothes out to dry so theyre still wet for a while. Would that be a problem or do microorganisms need much more time or better circumstances warm wet nonventilated space to grow?  ,microbiology,dfcex6x,1,t5_2qirk
