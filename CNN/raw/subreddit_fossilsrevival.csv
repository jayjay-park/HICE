5754530,0,t1_cxacpj6,Discovering and Rediscovering the story is what keeps me coming back. I love the tie in explaining vanilla effects with worthwhile lore which then leads right into adventure as a reward for mining and exploring.As the stories to be discovered by the stone tablets has expanded its gotten a little hard to keep the chronology streight and almost impossible to put up a museum to walk people through what happened. An in game journal to track the story would be nice but more then one variety of stone tablet so each story has its own branchvariety would lend itself to expansion better.If youre expanding the trinkets please expand them with lore. Id love some explanation for jungle and desert temples civilizations and what brought them down. The brutal utility of the Ancient sword and helmet are awesome and in line with Atums pharoah treasures which I tend to also collect for the same reasons. Their function doesnt have to be as awesome as Anus bling just something that ties into minecraft mechanics.I like the pottery shard system and wish I could repair the figurines as well. If adding characteristics to the pottery a few new glazes would be nice porcelin doesnt work for me Ill report it properly but not as much as being able to use the kylyx and amphora as a bucket the volute as a flowerpot Im presently futzing around to add them to the list of thaumcrafts infusion stabilizing items.BTW Im doing a LOT of testing and wasnt sure where to report bugs the Github didnt seem to be active on the .. branch.,fossilsrevival,cxaeke2,5,t5_3844g
