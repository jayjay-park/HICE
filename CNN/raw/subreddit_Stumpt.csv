1779692,0,t3_2evh8s,Agrarian Skies is not going to be  Episodes. Youll see that things get built very quickly when you dont have a couple of annoying workers always destroying everything.And yea there are lots of exciting things in the works for Starbound. We toyed around with playing the Nightly for our Starbound series but decided it wasnt worth it because we might lose our saves. So instead we are playing the most recent Stable update with lots and lots of mods. And both Rik and Price are seasoned vets at Invisible Inc but youll find that even the person playing it admits its damn hard. ,Stumpt,ck3hgkw,1,t5_30jsp
2614011,0,t1_cmzaf2p,I guess i didnt phrase it right but what i meant was that when you played.. Say chariot i thought that it was a series so a first look series could help with that. TLDR It would be for categories,Stumpt,cmzsf1k,2,t5_30jsp
3863509,0,t3_34nsgp,Yes! This one is for sure on our todo list. It looks exactly like what we love to play.Thanks for the suggestion!,Stumpt,cqwoaq3,2,t5_30jsp
4526596,0,t3_3d217k, Personal favorite episodes? Whats the best advice youve gotten as a member of stumpt?  What future game are you looking forward to playing? Whos producing the lonely fox lighthouse keeper?Those are my top ish questions. Edit Hmm I should probably watch the stumpt log. You should find a way to shorten those up a tad. I like my bullet points.  ,Stumpt,ct17r10,2,t5_30jsp

6648788,0,t3_46jutq,Hey Rik and fans!Thank you Rik for fulfilling my request on Twitter to share Rikeshis castle with us. That is awesome and I cant wait to play this with my friends. It must have taken a lot of effort to build that thing well done sir! D That being said here are so technical informationInstallation. Download the file. Change the filename from Takeshis Castle.db.cffefcce to Takeshis Castle.db. Must have been a bug when it was uploaded the game only recognizes .db files. Move that file to your Scrap Mechanic savefiles located here CUsersUserAppDataRoamingAxolot GamesScrap MechanicUserUserxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSave. Launch the game and press Load Game and it should be there! Having any other difficulties just reply to this post!and Rik I fixed your stop sign that was bugged. The controller was set to LOOP and thats why it got caught in the fence PScreenshot here!,Stumpt,d071j55,3,t5_30jsp

7527889,0,t3_4h6jxz,Well they just ended the st part of the stumpt lore all about fake Rik. They said themselves that it was really getting hard to follow and that it was time to start anew. Thats why spoilers for Hubris finally Fake Rik died.,Stumpt,d2xvtzr,1,t5_30jsp
