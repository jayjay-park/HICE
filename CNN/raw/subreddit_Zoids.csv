3336344,0,t1_cp8jr82,Just tried it out.Did you remember to transfer over the PCR part from the AB unit connector into the standard joint when you tried it yourself?I first just threw together O O and R and it was just like you said the hole was too big and the blade would just fall out. But then I noticed on the inside of O there was clearly a spot for a part from a PC runner so I took apart one of my AB unit connectors took out PCR which the blade was attaching to already so I knew it would fit the blade at least transferred the PCR over into the standard nonAB joint it fit into O perfectly and it worked like a charm. Completely tight and poseable.Unfortunately among all the extra parts there are no extra PCRs so if you want to switch between AB and nonAB you do have to take apart the joints and transfer that one part but at least its good to know I have the option!,Zoids,cp8khld,1,t5_2siii

3488837,0,t1_cppp2dn,Genesis is that weird part of the anime where people either hated it loved it or just never saw it. it was still relatively new when I was SUPER into Zoids so I was real excited for it downloaded the entire season and binged it in about a week. I just recently watched it again with my fiance because I told him that part of the marriage agreement was watching all of Zoids Pits a great series but I get why not everyone likes it. the designs are pretty different and the animation peaked at NCZ. the only series in the anime that I can say is just straight up terrible is Fuzors. for basically every reason. but I still like the designs some of the Zoids had like the Falcon and the Gairyuki.,Zoids,cppyawc,3,t5_2siii

3977600,0,t3_35w6p3,hey there! we have a great guide on model tools in our Wiki  I suggest looking into small nippers paint wise you can choose to go acrylic or enamel it depends on what you want. I recommend looking at videos of gundams with enamels and acrylics to decide what you like better.,Zoids,cr9ohlo,2,t5_2siii
4561316,0,t1_ct5j7d9,If you want it to look like the one on amiami I suggest working in acrylics and attempting to panel line. Really the only things you need for those kinds of accents are the paint a nice brush spend an extra buck to get a couple brushes with really nice tips  youll like it better in the long run. You dont need a  brush but something better than a kids brush goes a long ways. And Id suggest an exacto knife great for scraping off a stray drop of paint that wont wipe off of an edge. Most importantly have fun and take your time! Im sure itll look awesome. The fox is a great starter kit.If you have any questions feel free to PM and Ill help as best I can.,Zoids,ct5kjsc,2,t5_2siii

10948451,0,t1_de984u3,Ive had my eye on either the HMM Blade Liger BangVan Version or the HMM Geno Saurer Raven Version for almost a year now and I havent pulled the trigger. Its a lot of money to spend and Im always concerned that Ill get ripped off by someone on Amazon or EBay. What is a decent price on those kits? Ive seen the Geno Saurer around  but Ive never seen the Blade Liger for under . ,Zoids,de9974p,1,t5_2siii
11329165,0,t1_dfg2ead,Yeah man. What the guy about said. They are well colored. I just wanted the stealthier look and to being out the detail they have packed in. Tips from a noviceCoat as evenly as you can with primer. Dont go for all metallic paints. Matt looks great too. And if you can assemble a block then prime it. More even. ,Zoids,dfg54ez,1,t5_2siii
11397033,0,t1_dfmm8s4,As far as I knowVans blade liger used to get fairly regular rereleases though I dont think its had one in quite a while.Leons Blade liger got two releases runs as the original version and repackage version.Mirage at this point is truly limited.  It only got an initial release.  But while I encourage people to buy from Kotobukiya... this one did get a bootleg version.  Dont know about the quality of it or if it has the characteristic pearly plastic of the koto release though.,Zoids,dfnu773,2,t5_2siii
11398409,0,t3_62ng96,Hmmmm I typically use a combination of the small pieces of tape method and bluetack for masking.It seems Tamiya makes curve masking tape.  Never used it myself but it might be worth a shot.Maybe for the circular pieces create a circle using a drafting circle template then cut it out with scissors?,Zoids,dfnztw3,1,t5_2siii
