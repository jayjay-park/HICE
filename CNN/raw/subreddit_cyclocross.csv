524515,0,t3_1zrnba,so like I know Specialized has had all kinds of hatred directed at it lately some deservedly so and its another major brand but my Crux Pro disc is by far the best fit and best handling bike Ive ever ridden. I also think its gorgeous I like the Tron paintjob your preference may vary.  The big red S has gone into disc CX in a big way with carbon and alloy frames specced at pretty much every price point.Ridley is another well regarded brand although the handling is straightup racey and could be considered a bit harsh for a quiver killer. That said my coach rode his XFire with me for  hours on a dirt road leg crusher on Sunday and claims the comfort level is just fine. A lot of my teammates have these bikes.  Excel is currently blowing out Ridley frames so if you want to roll your own assuming they have your size youre in luck.If you happen to win the lottery be completely made out of money or know a guy who knows a guy I think this Alchemy Balius is by far the most beautiful cross bike ever made and its fully custom. I saw a Di  hydraulic version of this bike out at one of the local CX races here in Denver last fall that made me utterly abandon my dislike of all things Shimano.edit  I know a lot of these are not the S spec youre looking for but they do come in comparable spec Ridley does an OEM build in Ultegra and Spesh has a couple variations on that build etc.... also Im not a gent so take that as you will.,cyclocross,cfzw5ud,3,t5_2r84y

948916,0,t3_24oprf,Im running a pair of Maxxis Mud Wrestlers on Stans Alpha  rims with Stans Alpha Rim Strip to keep them nice and tight on the rim since theyre not tubelessready tires.I use about  mL of Stans sealant per tire. I check the fluid level in the tires and refill them periodically adding fluid if I cant hear the liquid sloshing inside the tire when I shake it.For cyclocross racing depending on the course conditions I run anywhere from  psi front  psi rear favoring the lower end of those ranges especially on courses with wet or loose sections. My default is  psi frontrear. Below  psi fr which is really fucking low pressure already but below that you risk rolling the tire off the rim while cornering as the lateral force on the tire can pull the rubber aside and let the rim hit the ground usually taking the tire off with it.I would not run this setup above  psi both because high pressure sacrifices vital traction during a race and because anything above  psi risks blowing the tire off the rim in a violent dangerous fashion especially with nontubelessready tires.When you mount a new nontubeless tire tubeless for the first time add the sealant and then carefully pump it up to  psi stopping at about  psi to ensure that the bead is seated on the rim properly before continuing to higher pressure. Once at  psi swirl the wheel around to distribute the sealant look for leaks and then let the wheel sit flat on one side overnight to distribute the sealant over one sidewall. The next day the tire should have lost a bunch of air. Pump it back up to  psi swirl it around again and then let it sit on the other side to seal up the other sidewall.Then add some more sealant to replace what was just used sealing up the sidewalls. This whole process isnt really necessary for tubelessready tires since their sidewalls are already made to be airtight and ready for pressure.After you get everything set up pump em up and start riding. Get a feel for how different pressures perform in different conditions.

1809834,0,t3_2f9tp9,Ive used the gore and older SRAM pit stop sealed cables. They were on commutercx racer road and on mountain bikes. They work usually they work really well but they arent perfect. The advantage is not just that they keep dirt out but also keep lube in. Ive been able to use slick honey tenacious oil triflow and cable magic inside the housing and it stays for a long time. In my mind this is the real beauty of the system the cable is always saturated in lubricant. Usually I can go about a year on a commuter with excellent shifting between changing cables. The housing was fine at the year mark but the sealing bits between the housing usually needed to be replaced due to... Abuse. The down sides are worth noting. They cost more they take more time to install and the installation needs to be right to seal properly and they have mixed luck with sealing the derailleur end of the housing so stuff can sometimes get in there. ,cyclocross,ck79cjb,5,t5_2r84y

Aluminum framefork probably upgrade to carbon fork before the year is finished. It has disc mounts but Im running cantilevers for now.It was the cheapest option I could find for my commuterbeater and wannabe CX racer.For under  youre probably looking at something  speed used which is fine. Even the worst maintained bikes will only cost  to get repaired to a rideable state.

Its a great frame with speed shifters and mechanical discs so youll be set for most riding. It retailed for  CDN so you might be able to talk down to an . Even more bonus if you can get a  A. My only concern with both is the bottom bracket. Its the smaller version of the FSA megaexo and not really compatible with anything. I had this problem with my Norco CRR.

8109657,0,t1_d4pkwiz,gt MTBers are always described as the best bike handlers often used to explain why Sagans skills are noticeably better than many in the peloton  if youre good on an MTB youve got the foundation.This is the cliche yes but its no guarantee of anything. Mountain bikes and road bikes handle differently and the skills arent unrelated but there are major differences. Really I dont know why so many people just take it for granted that Peter Sagan for example is a fabulous road bike handler simply because hes originally a mountain biker. And forget that his MTB skills are also outstanding. And that most importantly he practices all the time. Nonetheless descending an Alpine pass on a road bike isnt really the same as tackling a supertechnical XC trail on an MTB. A guy like Sagan is incredibly talented period so hes good at both of these things but even he has gotten as good at them as he is by practicing them relentlessly.So practice practice practice. Thats the key. Practice both general skillbuilding riding trails on your cross bike and specific cyclocross skills cross course features like barriers offcamber riding sand etc. Cross is unique in that courses will often demand a mix of handling skills stemming from road and mountain biking with some CXspecific stuff thrown in. Knowing how to find the fast line through a corner and maximize exit speed is more of a roadie skill thats incredibly valuable in cross. Then theres handling or turning a bike on rough terrain with limited traction which is more of a MTB skill. And so on. Theres really no substitute for specific training and practice.,cyclocross,d4rljuk,3,t5_2r84y

There arent that many wide alloy tubular options out there either hence why I went with As and Major Toms. I initially built the tubulars and had Aksiums for trainingpit wheels but the difference in width was so big that it was really difficult to set up the brakes to work with both. I had to have it perfectly set up with the adjusting screw all the way in on the wide rims to just barely scrape by on the narrow rims with the adjuster all the way out.I probably would have gone disc but I had road parts lying around and decided I would wait for proper hydraulic discs to be commonplace before going that route.

Youll be doing some weird stuff on and off the bike so becoming  comfortable with it is crucial. I would recommend in addition to riding on the road and on trails to practice the specific techniques a cross course will demand. Most importantly learn how to get on and off the bike smoothly. Lots of videos on YouTube show you the proper technique. Practice it slowly and speed it up as you become more accustomed to the motions. I will build my fitness throughout the year then tune myself up for cx with specific workouts leading up to the season. I like to throw in a day on the mountain bike here and there then as the season approaches I will begin riding the cx bike on most of my rides.

9599535,0,t3_5cfysu,Im new to CX but I use my SSCX bike as my pit bike. Our races arent really that muddy but it is there in case I get a flat or break something on my bike. If Im in a singlespeed race then there is nothing in the pit.  I see other guys do the same thing around here. A lot of the pit bikes are singlespeeds or mountain bikes. Just something so you can finish your race.,cyclocross,d9wc7ng,5,t5_2r84y

10139835,0,t3_5l5qe6,Heres my take Ride Your Bike any time any way you wantI own a Scott Scale mtb Litespeed Vortex road beast and a Ridley Crossfire If I had to choose one it would be the Crossfire on road gravel and what have you. i use s on it but have a race set of wheels for cross and a beefier set for general use. Of course you only need one set. This is my take but go on youtube and watch The Napoleon Games Cup world tour pros on and off road that is not cyclocross just the best I watch the races onMy two bits worthCheers,cyclocross,dbt83su,3,t5_2r84y

11070289,0,t3_5y2xd0,Even at  Id be looking at the . But everyone rides different. Ideally you bring a stubby stem with you for the test ride. The stem combines with the forward sweep of the bars in determining the feel of the steering.,cyclocross,demt250,2,t5_2r84y
11080586,0,t3_5y8cj1,You can stand on  pedal the SPD cleats one without a cage without clipping in as well it just maybe a little tougher so I think its more of a style  preference. Sometimes you see these kind of SPD pedals with large cages  platforms for people new to clipping in or pedals for people who may sometimes use clip in shoes and sometimes use normal shoes. Between those two specific ones you linked I dont think youll need the ones with the cage. Now comparing SPDs to Candy Pedals to Time ATAC to Speedplay SIZR...thats a whole other can of worms.,cyclocross,denz3bl,3,t5_2r84y

11797031,0,t1_dgwhfqx,Shimano forced their hand. Shimano said theyd only support mm rear hub width if the chainstay length was over X length because otherwise the smallsmall gear combo had too extreme of a chain angle. So Specialized offset the cassette to bring the chain angle into spec because they didnt want to sacrifice the handling with longer chainstays. The next year Shimano changed their minds and loosened their spec to allow that level of chain angle so now Specialized moved the cassette back to the standard position with standard wheels.,cyclocross,dgx8fat,3,t5_2r84y
11806039,0,t1_dgy80jv,I think wolftooth have that option but not sure ab does.I dont mind it not looking as good but I cant afford to try lots of different chainring sizes so Im trying to get a feel for the options.I think ideally Id slap the classic  on and call it a day but the ultegra rings are hella pricey,cyclocross,dgy978l,1,t5_2r84y
