I dont know if Im the minority with this but I wouldnt care much if those species were to go extinct  the same thing has happened to countless species throughout history. Regardless the primary purpose of factory farming is certainly not species conservation.,Zoomies,dejov0i,2,t5_3bd7e

11535194,0,t3_64knxg,This is a Norwegian Forest Cat I have one at home and he looks almost this big but when we cut his hair for the summer he looks like a normal huge cat.  Our vet said it wouldnt hurt him to lose a little weight but youd think we were force feeding him when you look at him in the winter.  Their fur is crazy longthick and gets absolutely everywhere. ,Zoomies,dg3ilsw,9,t5_3bd7e
