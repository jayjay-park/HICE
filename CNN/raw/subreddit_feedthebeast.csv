17565,0,t3_1ubejt,The problem is that everything changes too quickly. Even vanilla Minecraft updates and changes almost too fast for its own wiki. Folks here on the FTB end of things need to first process those changes then discover and understand the new mod stuff and take the time to write it all down on a wiki usually about two weeks before its made obsolete.We have what hundreds of people working on new additions tweaks updates changes rebalances etc? By the time anything gets written down its already wrong or the changes that make it wrong are already in the works.

However what bothers me is when one mod can work with the other mod and the author still says they cant be together. Now Im sure we all know the biggest example of this and I personally dont know enough about the conflict to judge so if the two mod authors are in fact innocent then sorry for bringing that up Im just trying to say in general if this were to happen that is the line that should be drawn with regards to rights of the mod. I think mod authors should allow anyone to use their mod in any pack regardless of what other mods are in the pack.

219997,0,t3_1wmvvr,Depends entirely on which mods you have what you define as early game and what your own preferences are. In my case Ars Magica is a great mod for starting out with. As soon as you have access to some nether quartz you can build yourself a Light Nexus and a calefactor and that will take care of your ore doubling. Spell casting is available fairly early on as well depending on where you spend your skillpoints you can make spells incredibly early on so that opens up a lot of possibilities.A Thaumcraft start is kind of difficult as it requires you to get  different shards but once you get that done you can spend a lot of time scanning things. The scanning  research mechanics is kind of what makes me not want to do starts like this since you can get unlucky with research and get a few failures in a row. Once you get things going Thaumcraft is a ton of fun.Theres also Blood Magic and Witchery but the former requires a few diamonds to start with which is why I dont really consider that early game anymore... but once you get that going its a ton of fun. The latter Witchery Ive yet to get really into but I dont think thats a viable start either apart from using the seeds to stock up on those items when youre ready to start with the mod.So overall Id say Ars Magica is your best bet. Make some spells get a Light Nexus  calefactor for doubling your ores and sometimes tripling because you use a Light Nexus and you should be good to go.,feedthebeast,cf3i4s6,6,t5_2v620

428789,0,t3_1yzsbm,The more things doing calculations each tick the lower your FPS will be. Larger multiblock structures are better for ticks than singleblock structures this is because only one tick calculation is done for the whole block and multiblock structures typically have more volumecapacitywhatever.  AE nets are easier on FPS than pretty much any piping system for the same reason.If you get to the point where you are having FPS issues first look to your piping systems. Make sure everything flows smoothly and there arent any loosestray entities clogging up your systems.  After that look to move your power production which typically requires a great deal of space to some other obviously chunkloaded locations that you would then use tesseracts item mirrors or ender tanks in order to transmitreceive the outputs.Its also better to have fewer chunks loaded for overall strain on a server so stick to a single dimension.

But when the weekend comes and a major bug popped up the whole community freaks out if its not released. I just wish devs could give a time they are HOPING to have it out and the community was UNDERSTANDING that it didnt happen. I mean even if I get an eta of mid April its awesome.

If you use Forestrys tree breeding you can make trees that produce absurd amounts of resources.Blue Mahoe saplings produce . buckets of Forestry biofuel each. Balsa trees produce lots of saplings. If you take these two traits and put them on a single tree preferrably one with lots of leaves you will get tons of biofuel.Add in some sort of fruit to your tree and you could produce fruit juice.

695157,0,t1_cgj9pi3,I think the biggest issue isnt that its hard though many arent good at seeing why they dislike something. Rather the issue is that it has a lot of not fun processes in things like crafting where you need a lot of time just to craft components for another component which will be part of a third component for the machine. As I said before it artificially expands the playtime sometimes its fair enough to churn out more ages so to speak other times it seems more just to force a person to work on several things at once or really study up on every last bit you will need. Discouraging exploration  creativity. Add on top of that a very lacking wiki and bad ingame instructions note the discouraging exploration and the only information you will find is randomized and poorly written books in dungeons make people just say that its hard when in truth its not really hard just... tedious.As far as needing the infrastructure power generation and the like thats all good. Though I personally have found the EUt change to be rather absurd especially if its about realism because it goes against that by far if you know the slightest of electronics.Again I hope I dont sound too confusing and that my points were understandable gregtech the mod is if configured to not be a pain still a fun mod.

The two drawbacks I had with that are the added energy cost of breaking down everything all the way down to dust and then the lack of diamonds which I use rather liberally for activators and tesseracts.  I have my sieves going  gravel and dust.

Use a wooden hammer to smash  of those cobble down to gravel then crush the gravel to sand and finally crush the sand to dust.Use the dust on wooden barrels full of water in order to get clay blocks. Break the clay blocks for  pieces of clay.Use  clay for a bucket. Use  more clay with bonemeal and use those for a crucible.Youll need  cobble turned into cobble slabs for a slab furnace in order to cook your bucket and the crucible. You can also finally cook logs for charcoal as well.After lighting up your islandplatform place a torch under your crucible and start filling it with the rest of your cobble. Somewhere between  cobble melted will get you a buckets worth of lava. Make sure you have setup the water for you cobble gen and filled up your water barrels before bucking up the lava since that will be the last thing your clay bucket will ever hold.Have fun!,feedthebeast,cgx5vpg,2,t5_2v620

Capture a mage pech or any pech if you can autospawn them and get one that way. Trade with a mage pech and use the knowledge fragments you get to build up more primal points rightclick with the fragment in your hand.

Structure or mechanical spawning grenades would be a first step.Speaking of multiblock structures we dont have enough turrets. A solarturret made from spyglass lenses would be fantastic. Or maybe one that has a retractable saw blade and chops down trees in a set radius!Also mechanical spiders.

You could patch them with wool strips mixed with a tar substance or use a bucket under the leaks to collect water back. Could also adapt this for a mob killing device of some kind.

919511,0,t3_24nbrq,I like the soft hardcore mod. Allows you to die and respawn with one less heart when you get to zero then youre a ghost and can only interact with little things like levers or buttons. You can get your hearts back before you are a ghost by crafting them with an expensive recipe of diamond blocks and gold. This way there is still a risk of losing but you wont ever have that frustration at losing the world you spent so much time on completely. And if you feel like cheating you can revert back from ghost form.Id also add in special mobs deadly world infernal mobs.Also consider changing the configuration in the codechickencore config file to disallow infinite water. More an annoyance than a challenge if youre near an ocean but its kind of nice to have to figure out logistics of water supplies if youre in a desert or something. Although pams harvestcraft provides rain barrels that are much cheaper and simpler than for instance railcrafts rain barrel. If you have railcraft installed then you could use minetweaker to cancel recipes for any of the more cheaty avenues to get water. But again it may turn out to simply be more of an annoyance than you might prefer.,feedthebeast,ch8symg,1,t5_2v620

990754,0,t1_chgvtit,Back in .. recently started playing again EE was imbalanced. What I mean by that is by itself like any mod is fine theres nothing to compare it too. But when it was compared to the other mods it was kind of like why would you make thing x in mod y when you can just make condensers from EE which are soooo much more powerful? And why not make like a bajillion of them? Suddenly you had so much stuff not nessecarily a lot of items a lot of EMC because in EE an item could be changed into others like a diamond was I think worth  gold and  gold worth  iron. I think you had no reason to use any other mod or really use the stuff.So why use EE at all if it were imbalanced? Because it had some really awesome and useful items like a ring that let you fly that wasnt necessarily imbalanced. So you wanted those items. My guess is that in single player it didnt really matter people could avoid power flowers an array of condensers if they wanted to but on a server you couldnt because people would use them regardless.I hope that helps paint the picture for you ,feedthebeast,chgwmi5,10,t5_2v620

He is actually playing an older version of the packi think. .. just came out and it is harder. There are creepers that blow up and encase you in silverfish cobblestone with water in the middle. Regenerating mobs. Diminishing returns on food eaten.  No vanilla tools work everything is Tinkers Construct. Passive mobs attack backlike pigmen so they socialize. For a first play.

1111266,0,t3_26svtu,Im gonna toss this out here because well screw it. Golems are kinda unreliable and its a pain to have to cycle through items to get essentia properly. More over once you delve into TTKami you end up using a ton of essentia especially spiritus which a golem can hardly keep up with. My solution was to adapt a design from elsewhere with a few improvements. Basically I created a fairly large building with each jar isolated in a rowgrid style in the walls. Slap down a alchemical furnace and alembic as well as essentia tubes to the jars. In particular I used logistics pipes because I wanted to play with them some as far as creating a remote AE network but AE export busses could work just as well. I set each supplier to one of the  furnaces and set a unique mana bean. Routers handled coal input via barrels spanning the furnaces. In the end the entire system effectively refills as fast as possible and with absolutely no oversight on my part or worrying about stuck golems. The expense is obviously a big hurdle up front bur it drastically sped up my infusions once I let the mana beans build up some. I could run multiple ichor infusions back to back and not worry about waiting for the jars to refill.,feedthebeast,chulxyb,1,t5_2v620

Although to be fair the . packs are supposed to be locked in at this point.I personally already made a lite pack that had bc railcraft gt etc. in it but now its a completely custom pack.  To get others to join they have to install forge on their own and add the mods themselves.  Its not hard... for most people.  For many its hard or just annoying enough that they will stick with a default pack.  Thats why Ftb exists slowpoke even said that ftb exists because people didnt want to have to copy and paste mods and install forge.  Also btw exutils is already in lite  my point was that there are only two pipe systems in the pack and one of them is very buggy.  Its the flagship mod of the pack too.If you want him to get his phd tell him not to worry about new features for TE then just update it to . and get back to school.  Right?My issue with cofh is Lemming.  Ill admit I dont like the guy so when I see this stuff i get irritated.  If youre interested in why keep reading if not just stop now. He once said that his steel recipe configs were for masochists and when i called him on it his response was that there was no way to make steel in his mod so only masochists would use that config optionNow tell me that is not a disingenuous statement?  Youre obviously a smart guy i assume youre a guy does that sound right to you?  Or does it sound like someone playing to his crowd then realizing he had disparaged part of the crowd and like a good politician trying to make it sound like he had not meant to bash anyone at all?  Because it makes no sense no one would even be able to make his items if there was no way to make steel in the modpack and every ftb pack up to that point had railcraft installed so he knew exactly what they were for.  He was playing to the ftb forum crowd that was very anti gt and anti tedium so he was saying that people who used steel to make his machines were masochists.  And the lemmings over there swallowed his explanation like a bunch of suckers.There are a few other run ins ive had iwth him where he has done similar things.  He absolutely knows that only converting rf TO mjs and not back is a big blow to MJ support and he absolutely knows that even if dymamos used MJs people would use them over combustion engines.  He claims to worry about balance but he clearly makes items a bit stronger to attract players.  Its very obvious.Think about this... why does a dynamo need water piped to it?  ExUtils has furnace generators that just run on coal ic has coal generators.  Why do dynamos need water?   A bc combustion engine keeps track of its temperature.  In a desert it will actually suck more water than if you run it in a colder biome.  A BC pump with redstone engines doesnt pump much water you can easily run into issues where you make a build in a regular biome then try to replicate it in a desert and find out that your build doesnt work now.  But water in a compression dynamo... you put one Aqueous Accumulator it will run the exact same way every single time every biome etc.  The engine cant explode so the Accumulator is there for... well whats it there for?  It adds no game play no puzzle to solve no hurdle to overcome.  Its just... tedium.  I could be wrong maybe some sort of temp is calculated internally but I havent seen it and it doesnt matter anyway because the dynamos cant explode even if you shut off the water.  My long winded point is that the dynamos were designed to appear to be complimentary to BC items that people were used to but they were superior in many ways so even without RF they would be picked first by everyone over combustion engines.  But he smiles at everyone is very self deprecating like a great politician so people shrug off issues with TE and praise him even more.  Just like you did i want him to finish his phd!   He is a very good salesman like my boss.  Eveyrone that meets my boss likes him within  minutes of meeting him.  While I do well at it im also honest while my boss lies to get ahead.  Greg is honest too.  Notice in his comment on the ic forums about the dispute with mdiyo he says yes i did put the crash code in but at least im honest about it and then says mdiyo is being sneaky.  Sneaky people win.  Its why politicians all suck and yet they still get elected.  Tell people what they WANT to hear and they will like you.  I say what i think is true and dont care what people want to hear so Ill never be like Lemmming.  I doubt you cared to read all that if not no biggie.  ,feedthebeast,cixc4c3,1,t5_2v620

Think of it this way COuld I make a Pulverizer and Redstone Furnace and Induction Smelter and make them look and act just like the TE ones do and not get in trouble?

It is often seen as a bluish or other color glow in the air adjacent to pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages.

1780917,0,t3_2ew1y5,BC Pipes have a lot of addons that can make them amazing. The big one is Logistics Pipes. You could make a small LP network with an extraction module mk on the quarrys chest and an itemsink module polymorphic works without any configuraton as long as something is in the barrel on the barrel.Another addon that might just be fast enough without getting into Logistics Pipes is Denpipes. There is an automatic wooden pipe that when combined with a gate it can remove items from a chest extremely fast. The downside along with most BC pipes is that if you run out of room in an inventory items can be tossed on the ground. There are ways around this. If youre sorting items try to have a straight line of pipes with the inventories immediately next to the pipe line. Overflow will just move further down the pipe line if there is no room. You can use insertion pipes or diamond pipes to remove the random nature of intersections. Also BC gates are amazing things and can make a BC piping system pretty damn intelligent. ,feedthebeast,ck3n03r,2,t5_2v620

1812176,0,t1_ck7i01c,Hrm... The UNIX engineer in me wants to tell you to install Linux.  The troll in me wants to tell you to delete your WINDOWSSystem folder and reboot for best speedup.But ultimately its basically all about good system hygiene.  Clean up after yourself.  Reboot when it tells you to and not less often than once a month.  Keeping your personal files on a separate partition would let you reinstall the OS without losing them if you had to.  If you install something make sure you do so as cleanly as you can.  Uninstall one thing per reboot as annoying as that can be.  Use portable selfcontained apps when possible.  Make sure you have a good firewall config and that your antivirus isnt a resource hog.  Use WinDirStat to look up whats using up your systems disk space ... Google all files before deleting but do this relatively often.  In the case of Java keep only the versions you need installed.  It will hide them.  Same goes for system updates from MS.  Drivers are your enemy they need to be up to date but are rarely deployed in a clean manner.  It is often in your best interest to download them yourself uninstall reboot into safe mode and then install.If this all sounds like a lot of work... Well it is.  And generally speaking isnt necessary  not for any given item listed above.  It takes experience to get a feel for what will or will not be a big enough return on investment to be worthwhile.Of course... a lot of the above is part of why I switched to Linux fulltime.,feedthebeast,ck7jmdt,8,t5_2v620

Caps per x chunks area are  Hostile    Passive including bred tamed amp tagged    Ambient    Water  . Animal mobs spawn only on grass with light level  or greater. . For animals chance of spawning on already generated chunks is very rare. Mobs spawn in packs of the same species  by  up to . Species of entire pack is chosen randomly from eligible choices. Biomes differ in species eligible for spawn. There must be no players and no player spawn points within a  block distance spherical of the spawning block.Ocelots spawn en masse because your platform is probably jungle biome with grass above  lvl conditions fullfilled and also because for some reason Ocelots are considered hostile mobs in the code.

1912413,0,t3_27eucl,More Tips One of the first machines you should make is the tree harvester. It will provide you with infinite water and you wont have to waste iron on shears after its up. One of the second machines you should make if going for noncheaty cobblestone is the igneous extruder. One bucket of lava and one bucket of water gives you infinite cobblestone. A pulverizer is a good machine to have. Pulverizing your cobblestone will give you gravel which provides much better sieving materials than dust. Sieved gravel gives you diamonds and emeralds. The burning promethum provides faster water and lava generation than lava. Some types of glass are nonflammable and it may be wise to put nonflammable materials near the promethum in order to boost workplace safety. The process of making circuit boards can be semiautomated early on. Use a servo to pipe a baked PCB out of the UV Light Box and into a dropper that drops it into the etching acid. Once you have a fully etched PCB put a hopper under the acid and put the etched PCB in the first slot and fill the rest of the slots with junk like dusts. Now all you have to do is put blankedunbaked PCBs into the UV box you can use a hopper to do this as well if you wanna make em it batches it will eventually end up in the hopper fully bakedetched. Ancient spores are a pain and you may not even get them by sieving several stacks of sand. If you want to get witch watersoul sand and havent been lucky enough to get ancient spores for mycelium then a sludge processor has a chance to make soulsand mycelium dirt sand and clay. You can hook this up to your MFR tree farm and get these things for a modest power cost. I recommend building the sludge processor  or so blocks underground so you dont get affected by the noxious gases it produces.,feedthebeast,ckjmtgx,3,t5_2v620

Now whenever we see him do anything everyone will just say Oh didnt he do that on forgecraft? which is a shame. I have no doubt hes gonna pull Soaryns  channel multidrive system out of the hat. Everyone will gawk and amaze over it. While others are gonna know where he got it from.    My other major concern is his growing love for SFM Steves Factory Manager. Were going to see a metric butt ton of automation with it. I can guarantee that for sure. Not bad really but i just hope his . mod pack doesnt have the same rehashed mods.

2103452,0,t3_2izrm8,Many people have already mentioned my points but Id like to talk about them from my point of view and also add a few points of my own.More and more mod developers seem to be turning to multistep crafting recipes to increase the difficulty of their mod. As already discussed IC is a perfect example of this adding in my view pointless extra steps to the crafting process of every item. In my opinion this only serves to bore. Some people may call this the grind but personally I view it as just more faff.The main challenge for me in modded minecraft is infrastructure. I love finding new more compact more efficient ways to massively overproduce a resource. For me this is where difficulty lies in modded minecraft not in the crafting table or the mines but in your base combining a number of block from a number of mods to come up with the best designs.I often see people saying that mods such as GregTech are a necessity for the longevity of a map because without the added difficulty they finish the game to quickly. Honestly I think this couldnt be further from the truth. Too many people get to the point where they have too many resources in their AE system and view this as endgame. For me this is where the game truly begins. With abundant resources I am now free to work on interesting and different projects which I have never tried before. For this reason ComputerCraft is probably one of the most difficult yet rewarding mods I have ever played with especially when combined with OpenPeripherals. It is because of ComputerCraft that I never find myself bored in modded minecraft because Ive always got a new idea for it whether it be a more advanced GUI API an advanced melon farmer automating TC infusion crafting or creating a fullyfeatured PvP arena complete with terminal glass HUD. However this amazingly flexible and versatile tool is by no means easymode because the challenge is in the coding just as the challenge of redstone is putting all the basic components together to make new contraptions.In conclusion difficulty is a weird concept in a game such as modded minecraft. But if you had to define difficulty it wouldnt be complex or resourceheavy crafting recipes it would be the challenge of creating new contraptions from the most basic of starting blocks.,feedthebeast,cl770bj,11,t5_2v620

The Turbine runs through steam really fast but if you run the high oven too hard it jams. The limited and buggy fluid transfer stuff really limits your options.Fluiducts only pull out  mbt which is way to slow to be useful.Fluid transfer nodes ignore filters making them useless.Steves factory manager cant pull out of high ovens.The only thing that makes this possible is that if you set a fluid storage bus on the high oven you can pull out fluid with a fluid export bus really quickly but only if you are outputting to a large enough tank to hold it. Thats why I output to the portable tanks which can put out  bt when on top of the turbine fluid port. I think the key is going to be setting up several high ovens and load balancing with SFM.

Remove AM from your client launch client and do an NEI dump to list unused itemblock IDs.Then readd AM launch and grab the launcher log output from the crash.  This will indicate to you which blocksitems are conflicting as that will be the cause of the crash.From there you just go into the AM.cfg file and modify the item ID number for the correct itemblock to one thats in your list of unused item IDs.You may have to relaunch two or three times.Youll then have to push that config up to your server and pass it along to your users.,feedthebeast,cleyfwj,0,t5_2v620

2216520,0,t3_2khfzg,I think it depends on your vision and how you plan on your tech working. Ill admit I havent looked at your pack much although I definitely plan on playing the finished one! but Id say you need to gate things if you plan on dimensionbased mob spawning.Like if the overworld is safe safer at least maybe have it only spawn certain ores and the rest can only be obtained in Twilight ForestNether or perhaps a MineTweakerd recipe for an important machine step is only found in one of those dimensions.Another thing worth considering is what makes it hard to survive. Like with BnB a large part of the initial difficulty is that you cant farm and food is a large issue. The fact that mobs can break torches also adds to this because its difficult to just set up a safe area with no mobs around also remember you cant sleep through the night in BnB  another thing you need to decide on.Like I said I havent actually read your details yet so sorry if this isnt much help  looking forward to trying to survive it! ,feedthebeast,cllkmqt,2,t5_2v620

2404749,0,t1_cm8uj5p,Honestly most of the SFM is pretty straight forward programming logic. Do this gt Then do this gt Then do this etc. You can go nuts with autocrafting and convoluted automation but the initial steps arent too bad. I do wish there were better documentation for some of it though because it isnt always clear where things are or what a given device is for.One thing that tripped me up at first when selecting an inventory the direction section is referring to which side you want to interact with not the direction youre trying to go so down for instance is actually the bottom of the object not something coming down at the top. Also as long as theres an inventory cable touching a side of the object itll work so you dont need to have one at the input and output points just one of them.That ability to run an in and out on the same face of a machine is the main use I got out of SFM at first because I was trying to automate a fermenter from Rotarycraft and between the power source heat source heat sink and water I didnt have any way to set up a standard hopper feed or AE connection.

Whereas if its just a lowly text editor where the memory is hardly touched past initialization the data can exist quite happily there.At any rate its more important to note the good information hereJRE and below have trouble managing memory especially with a heap size of more than Gb. Keeping under this threshold is critical to avoiding a strange phenomenon where you tell Java to use no more than Gb and suddenly its eating Gb  it shouldnt happen but it does.Dropping frames in Minecraft  assuming the heap is adequate Press F you should have roughly  of the memory allocated actually in use to keep things happy  is an indicator that your graphics card or CPU is stressed in one or more ways. For example if your GPUs memory pool is full you will start experiencing stutter every  seconds which will last for an instant. You may have an otherwise high framerate but this temporary pause is a direct indicator of that condition the solution to be trying a lower resolution texture pack or playing in a Window instead of fullscreen.CPU bottlenecks are indicated by the tickrate dropping  mobs randomly darting across the screen or you getting moved back to a previous position. This will also usually be indicated by a Cant keep up message in the logs.Finally comes disk bottlenecks. Minecraft stores all of the chunk data on disk  and for good reason a map can very easily get quite large when exploring. The indicator of this condition is when chunk loadstore operations become unresponsive. For example if you are approaching previously generated chunks and the ones behind you have not yet disappeared and the ones in front of you are taking a while to show up  your disk is probably thrashed with data and needs a second to catch up.Of course this only accounts for a very small sample of the potential problems and sources for said problems in Minecraft. And all assumes you are running on Windows and have a standard memory management configuration. Things get very different on OS X amp Linux but thats a whole nother rodeo.,feedthebeast,cmjrbls,3,t5_2v620

I havent played much botania its on my list but the minute something with no numbers becomes hard to eyeball people will get frustrated and make their own numbers with whatever tools they have kind of like the TF trading communitys refkeybud system and organized market.Ill admit that I am a math guy not as much in game as IRL but the minute the game forces me to pull out a piece of paper to do homework I move on to the next game.

Regardless you can play through GregTech without needing a single IC block or item except for maybe rubber trees and sticky resin. In fact todays GregTech is similar to old IC in a lot of ways.

Mk was designed to produce BioMass for our  biogas engine.  It was producing apples which got turned into mulch. Remaining mulch left over from fermentation that didnt get used. Was also used to ferment the apple juice into biomass. each engine produced mjt. We could fill a energy cell almost instantly.    The system was so efficient it kept itself fueld off the charcoal we made from the logs.  Mk used the same principle. We had  engines running of RCCreosote oil produced from the  coke ovens we had in the design....gtgt ..we only managed to get to  coke ovens before the server reset. The efficiency was improved by using FzRouters. We linked together a specific number of coke ovens using  router network each. There were two routers for each coke oven processing lane.  router inserted logs from a scChest cart. While another router grabbed the charcoal. The chest cart passed over a incinerator filled with RP Igniters. The igniters would turn on whenever the cart dumped excess logs that were not being processed. The cart would then go back to the collection facility loaded up with the processed charcoal. Dump it all off and start again.    The Mk design was so efficient we made over million charcoal in  days of operation. Over  fullsized Xycraft Multitanks were constantly filled with Creosote oil.,feedthebeast,cnv9txy,3,t5_2v620

This is useful because it allows things to define themselves as a RF input output or both whereas before they could only be a RF handler.

If its the first one chances are you just have too many modsyour computer isnt good enough to handle it. Here are a few suggestions Install Fastcraft if you havent already Try optifine and see if that will help. If you want faster world gen and better looking worldgen install a mod called Climate Control. It will seriously improve the speed and look of the terrain gen. Do you have enoughtoo much ram allocated? What pack are you running? Do you have a memory leak? A good way to determine that would be to post a mod list. Run a dedicated cauldron server and connect to it and play in that instead. This option will require some more advanced knowledge. Install Tick Dynamic.Now if its the latter these last tips should help as well but there are a few other things you can try. Run OPIS and profile the game. OPIS will let you know what machinestiles are causing the most lag.  Explain where your lag is coming from. Does it get worse when you get in your base?

I had a ridiculous supply of ender pearly before I had any reason to build a reactor. If you dont find ender lilly seeds early sure but depending on what you do in the earlyish game you may very well have those pearly long before you need a significant enough power drain to make a reactor.It also depends on server vs SP whether the output is going to be significant enough. I personally tend NOT to have a ridiculous amount of redstone by the time Ive found lillies but that could very well be a consequence of being a more adventurey than miney player.The only things I have reason to build a reactor for are RFTools which usually ends up baing mystcraft ages anyway and mining lasers.

A whirlpool opens up and your boat is pulled into it and quickly submerges. You are knocked out but wake up in a pool of water to discover that the boat is upside down with some air trapped inside and its somehow being held in place a hundred blocks from the surface. Below you is water all the way to the void. Above you is a hundred blocks of water a layer of ice and a burning blue sun that freezes your skin if you are exposed to it. You have a few precious supplies in your boat but you didnt plan to find yourself stranded for long term so you have to try and clear the water from areas so you can use them to grow food and build machines that will help you to survive.I plan on rewriting the water physics slightly so that if you poke a hole in the ceiling the water will slowly fill up your ship.

3721721,0,t1_cqgfugw,Super Crafting Frame Thermal Dynamics Factorization Progressive Automation Extra Utilities. Theres too many to list.  Possibilities are endless as long as Youre creative.Example..  I used TE itemducts to sort items into JABBA barrels with a chest on the end of the line. Then XU transfer node sorted leftover items that I didnt want to make a barrel for into strongboxes and filing cabinets.  Since all ores went to the second part of the system a Retrieval Node was able to pull everything that was supposed to be processed into another buffer chest to be redistributed to a set of machines. XU item filters are highly configurable and dont have a cap on number of items they can sort.   Programmable Rednet Controller to regulate a bunch of LiquiCrafters to produce crucial crafting components.  Top and bottom lines of barrels with transfer nodes to supply  strongboxes with ingots glass and all other important crafting items via rationing pipes. That way I always had access to a stack of each material near a crafting table...    With the introduction of Thermal Dynamics with filters and retrievers I mainly focus on that. Theyre highly configurable and fun to set.  Its possible to regulate pretty much everything now including crafting frames.And thats just few mods.

One opens on questline another opens a different one.ExampleEarly game has access to essentially Agricraft and vanilla content. After a bit of progression youre offered a set of rewards.

You can get three Pearls worth of Ender from a single Enderman like this plus the usual drop chance. Vinculotus  Smeltery  ???Im in love with the good old Cursed Earth monster farm just because of this. Water currents leading to Punji Sticks kill everything except the Endermen which teleport when they hit water... right into a Smeltery which gives me a frankly insane amount of Pearls. The whole thing requires no power except for the trickle of Mana the Vinculotus uses.You can also cast the Liquified Ender into Blocks of Solid Ender using a Casting Basin which makes for more compact storage and can be used as a cheap and awesomelooking Beacon baseThe Vinculotus has a range of  blocks by the way.,feedthebeast,cqsaf64,35,t5_2v620

3949197,0,t1_cr5wzio,Im not sure how you can still be supportive of the idea of mods locked behind paywalls after the whole Skyrim ordeal. Dont get me wrong as a person whos been modding his games for a long time I have nothing but gratitude towards mod devs and I completely agree that you deserve to be rewarded for taking the time of your lives to make a game better more than some YouTubers should be allowed to make thats for sure but sometimes it feels like some of you guys dont even play modded games yourselves. Locking your mods behind paywalls comes with great great sacrifices and is overall a terrible solution to wanting to make a living off your mods.And even if you do manage to paywall your mods I sincerely doubt youll still be earning enough to not need a day job Better go get a drink reader because this is going to be a long one. Lets assume you manage to keep all your downloads for now. Your mod is only accessible to those who paid for it. Whatever thirdparty hosting website maybe Curse maybe not will want a cut of it. Maybe even the devs themselves Mojang in this case will want a cut of it. And what about mods developed by more than a single person or using thirdparty resources? For example doesnt Chisel use a few Painterly Textures or at least used to? Surely theyre either not going to allow it or are also going to be demanding a cut of it. Im sure other mods have more than one developer as well and theyll want cuts for themselves. Hoping they dont end up disbanding because someone feels they deserve more than the others...Thats already a lot of cuts for not a lot of money unless you drive the mods price up a wall. But its not over yet because as with any filter in this case paywall your amount of downloads is going to take a dive People are not going to be willing to pay for mods. Between not being able to afford it or simply because of the principle of the thing. Look at the state of affairs the gaming industry at large is in everyone and everything is trying to pinch as many pennies as they can off your wallet for the least effort humanly possible when theyre not too busy flatout screwing you over that is. People arent just endless fountains of money who are willing to throw money at everything. This will drive fans away from the modding scene. And those who are willing to pay are going to pick and choose what mods theyre going to pay for. Again people are not endless fountains of money they are not going to buy every single mod on the market. They are going to prefer wellpolished large mods that can hold their own mods that add both aesthetics game mechanics and a ton of content to the game such as TerraFirmaCraft or Thaumcraft. And what about modpacks? I dont think your average person feels comfortable paying to be paying up to the games original price or even more in mods alone to make an otherwise lackluster game enjoyable. You can kiss heavily modded multiplayer goodbye too since people will need to own every single mod in the pack to be able to play in the first place. Thats another whole group of customers driven away. This isnt specific for Minecraft either if paid mods become a standard you can bet someone somewhere will start to release lackluster games on purpose to profit off a cut of the games modders. What about mod piracy? This already exists in the form of those ltnumbergtminecraft sites and similar sites and it was actually allowed to be come a thing for the small amount of time Skyrim allowed paid mods. What makes you think fans of your mod wont just pirate it instead of paying you? Are modders really going to take the effort of implementing DRM into their mods? Heck you dont even need to look at the Google app store. Remakes or reimaginations of mods arent that rare in MCs modding community as it is. All it takes is someone making a better reimagination of your mod and your downloads take a dive especially if its free. There is no guarantee of quality no way to preview a mod. The first purchases of a new mod are leaps of faith and it will only grow due to blind consumerism wordofmouth andor reviews the last two of which will themselves be decreased because of the paywall. That one Shadowscale? suit in Skyrim is a perfect example the armor had no model for female characters it was a onepiececoverseverything armor as opposed to separate chestbootsgloveshelmet pieces like the rest of the armors in the game. It didnt even display in the item menu right blocking text. You couldnt even get in the game world you had to spawn it in using the console! And to top it all off the modder has no obligation whatsoever to come back and actually fix or even complete! his mod. Take a look at app stores theyre filled with cheap effortless content obviously made in desperate attempts to make money. What makes you think this isnt whats going to happen to MC mods? People who know nothing about the game or its community just barging in dropping a halfmade mod on the ground to get a quick buck and never again look at it? Its an extreme example but hopefully you get the idea.Theres a plethora of other reasons as to why paid mods are a bad idea such as legal issues with trademarked stuff. I wont list them here this post is pretty long as it is and Im sure people are still sick to death of hearing about them if they had paid any attention to the Skyrim fiasco and Im sure there are plenty of blogs andor videos that list those reasons much better than Ill ever be able to.My point is do you really think after all of these cuts and filtering the downloads anyone but the best of the best modders are going to manage to make enough of a profit to quit their day job and make a living off of? Is it worth making all these sacrifices for turning the games community mod fans and mod devs alike against eachother as if we didnt have enough of that already?,feedthebeast,cr6fxqn,5,t5_2v620

3961700,0,t3_35u8vr,Enable punch Botania flowers mode get some sand and get anything you can see which is easy to get and right there mode.  Look at your surroundings.  If there are cows punch the cows. If there are sheep punch the sheep.  If there is some bushes or apple tree punch those.  Do this for  minutes.  Punch at least  trees dont make planks and stick until needed.  Make wood pick.  Get  cobble.  Make      furnace  cobble     stone pick  cobble  sticks     stone axe  cobble  sticks  Dig a x room in a small hill any will do  Make a door.  Make a double chest.  Cook remaining logs. Except  logs.    Take first charcoal to make a torch for the hole.    Start digging diagonal down go straight to level .  If you end up in tunnels explore them for about  blocks for easy resources.  Come back and block them with cobble we know there are there dont need them right now.  If you end up at a ravine turn  and keep doing stairs.  You need to find iron and quartz. Bring the two logs.  When you find  quartz use the C crafting grid to make a quartz pick.  Use that pick if you see some gold and diamond.    Try to bring back some gold and maybe a diamond if youre lucky on your first trip.    When inventory full and youve got some ores go back up.  Dump everything in the chest.  Cook the iron directly.  While its cooking punch things outside like more flowers.    Craft a pure daisy place logs.  Craft another pure daisy. dig to have a flat surface of  stone blocks then dig the middle one down two. Place dirt place the pure daisy on that dirt. Youre converting rocks without digging and cooking it into magic rock directly.    Use  gold and a petal to make a mana spreader.  Make  daybloom.  Make a diluted mana pool from the converted rock. Replace the pure daisy into another rock doughnut.  Place the dayblooms the pool the mana spreader outside.  Use the first mana you get to enchant a pool.  Make  endoflames generates mana from burning stuff  Feed them blocks of coal or block of charcoal.  Make  mana ingot.  Make a ring of magnetism from the  mana ingot   iron   gold   glass pane.    You now have a unlimited item transport for  minutes ring.  And its going to be useful.  Make shears shear a grass make a horn of the wild.    Run around and blast the horn kill passive mobs dont care about inventory space.  Do this for about  minutes while making sure that the massive item collection you are dragging with the magnetic ring is staying with you. Go back and store all the things before they despawn.    At this point youll want to enchant  more ingot and make a manasteel pick. Its like an iron pick but when you get your first diamond you can use it to make a mana tablet and use that to always repair the pick. Even if you dont have the table right now you can start using it. Since you have stairs right to level  youll get one soon enough.    You can do a full set of manasteel armor too.    As soon as you get some obsidian try and make an enchantment table. Put two Mana Pylon on both side and you can enchant up to level ! You can start dumping your experience either in an XP grate with a drum or directly into enchanting your armor. Youre going to repair that armor so youll never waste the enchanment and you could use a magic cloth to change it later.    Next Ill suggest to make a cobblestone hammer itll make gathering ressources way faster and you probably can make a tool forge by using copper at this point.    I usually keep going into Botania to get a Sojourners Sash right after which makes moving about a breeze and greatly extends where you can run from with a stack of items floating around you.    Next comes the Smeltery but only because Im doing EU and RF Free plays right now.  Scanning things for Thaumcraft is also a good idea. Getting the infernal furnace makes looking for fuel moot and you can cook logs to make charcoal block for the Botania flowers. Bonus ore chunks are nice too but you dont need that many metals to do botania which is nice.,feedthebeast,cr7v8cx,60,t5_2v620

As for actual GregTech generation unfortunately it is not possible to cause the veins to generate more frequently. You can make individual veins larger but the veins are already huge to begin with so that wouldnt help.The actual algorithm spawns one vein of ore in the center of every x chunk square and thats fixed. However if you can find one vein you can iterate the pattern out from there and once you find a vein of something youre not going to need another vein of it for a while. Because of the varying spawn heights of ore veins it is possible for a chunk to not have a vein if the chunk is an ocean or something.I dont know what the Beyond Reality configs look like id need to download it but the default TinCassiterite generation range is between Y and Y.,feedthebeast,crq7pkv,2,t5_2v620

4124434,0,t3_37vwmq,Ok this is far from ideal but it should work.Pick a rare but fairly cheap item or block you dont have in your AE system. I would suggest a specific variety of chisel wood or similar. Create a pattern that returns that item and costs the first half of your flower items plus a different rare item that you do keep stocked in your system.Now dont have the interface directly next to the open crate but pushing into a chest that has an itemduct pulling stuff out. A filter would accept the second rare item allowing all the flower ingredients to go past into the crate. The filter would feed the second rare item into a system that dumps both it as well as one of the first rare item into the AE system.Now you have the first half of your ingredients in the apothecary the first rare item in your AE system and the second rare item back in the AE system for use next time. Now your main recipe that results in the flower should consist of the remaining ingredients for the flower plus the first rare item. So when crafting it the prerequisite recipe must be crafted first adding the first half of the flower ingredients to the apothecary. Your itemduct filter should also accept the first rare item to reset that system.This has a number of problems not the least of which is that you can only craft one flower at a time but it should work and represent correct resource costs on the interface.Another idea would include having the flower recipe only cost the single rare item. Its inserted from the interface into an AE subsystem that emits a redstone pulse that triggers a dump of exactly the right set of ingredients from a prefilled inventory.Or have a system to auto craft all flowers and keep a certain amount stocked then crafting more when you pull one out.I could probably come up with some more ideas.,feedthebeast,crqesd5,5,t5_2v620

He could be using Mb on one stick Gb on the second and . on the third. Windows will try to optimize memory access and have all allocated memory from a process together but that is by process not the whole system.Also Java should not see the sticks of memory. He should see the whole memory as one unit given by Windows on a bit address since its a  bit application and windows will do the mapping. For all java cares he should had received an address to Gb of memory since he asked windows to allocate that memory for him. If he only received . it was Windows failing to allocate that memory and giving it to java. You might have some problem with your windows installation or with your boardmemories...

But because those gamepacks have become popular some modpack devs think tweaking is required to be popularbalanced and see it as an easy out for kitchen sink packs I tweaked it so its balanced that makes it not a kitchen sink.  There is a difference between gamepacks where mods are limited and tweaks are made to fit the mods together into a unified whole and modpacks where devs tweak everything so they dont have to make choices and limit the number of mods. In almost all of those type packs they could have gotten the same balance by removing  mods instead of tweaking. There are days I am tempted to release a balanced kitchen sink pack without tweaks just because...The problem isnt gt that anything else is made by a lazy developerits that people think packs either have to be unbalanced or have to be themed. My issue is that half the tweaked packs the pack dev doesnt follow through on bugs they dont make sure the pack works. I and Iskandar and Eyamaz spend a lot of time testing our tweaks and we dont go to mod devs without checking the bug without the tweaks.  And we flat out state our packs are conversion packs and to not bother mod devs without talking to us.

4227132,0,t1_cs1t8i2,Thermal Expansion definitely added things that were just slightly easier and slightly more popular than alternatives at the time.This is on BuildcraftRailcraftForestry withwithout Thermal ExpansionThe Buildcraft machines  Quarry Refinery Lasers Forestry Farms Thermionic Fabricator  were gated on a powerpertick requirement. You could either build better engines or have the infrastructure to supply many engines at once.Two things from Thermal Expansion are Dynamos with much higher RFtblock than any previous Engine and energy storage.In Thermal Expansion the Dynamos each supply RFt. In Railcraft the Hobbyists engine the same fuel  water mechanic as the Steam Engine supplies RFt. To get more you need Boilers and either Steel or multiple engines. In Buildcraft you needed refinery tech and Fuel or multiple engines. In Forestry you needed farmed products and multiple engines.Multiple engines does matter  if you have a single block thats supplying everything you can throw charcoal in maybe a Hopper once every so often and just leave it. If you have lots it encourages automation pipe networks whatever.Im disregarding resource costs as nearly any metal can be supplied by your first trip with an Iron Pickaxe. Each are pretty similar in fuel efficiency but the Dynamos made everything just a bit easier.Theres also the energy storage. The Dynamo throttling feature Energy Cell and machine batteries all encourage the manually throw any amount of fuel in whenever strategy. If energy is lossy or wasted running things manually is tedious unpopular! in counting fuel amounts  before storage was an option there was at least some incentive to try Redstone controls.For instance the Quarry  upon moving it youd set up a few engines a few pipes enough fuel to last long enough maybe some Gates to turn it off when its done. That makes the power system a bit more interesting plus more to collect items. Now it can be a single Tesseract  energy and items.Even if we avoid teleportation a single Hardened Energy Cell lasts over an hour running the Quarry at max speed.Numbers being configurable might help pack designers but the defaults certainly affect popularity. I do like the Portable Tank although somehow it went from  buckets to .

4271715,0,t1_cs74i1n,I think the issue is that adding options to the config takes more coding time.  I dont think its fair to ask devs to offer options on everything but definitely thank them for the options they DO give us.  That being said the more configurable mods are really great for custom mod packs.  BTW twilight is harsh on servers only when generating new chunks.  THe overworld can get just as bad if you have too many mods that are including things that affect chunk generation.  There is a mod that pre generates chunks and along with a world border of a few thousand blocks can make TW workable for servers. Configs offer things minetweaker does not unless I am mistaken.  You cant change the power requirements of an ender quarry using minetweaker but you can using the config file.  And the issue I had recently with Thaumcraft was that the hosting company I used told me that TC lamps were the cuase of all the lag in my world so I should disable them.  Minetweaker will remove the recipe but not lamps that had been placed in the world.  At that point I couldnt even stay logged into the world for more than a couple minutes.  I ended up having to remove thaumcraft completely to be able to get back into the world.  If Azanor had offered a config option letting people disable certain items I could have just disabled the lamps.  Maybe this would screw up research and there is a good reason for him not allowing it though.,feedthebeast,cs7513f,3,t5_2v620

4419434,0,t1_csnp2cg,everyones first thought is bandwidth. if you have any broadband you are probably fine as bandwidth. However your problem will be your modem and router. An MC server is going to send packets. they wont be big or have alot of data but there sure will be a hell of alot of them. Most Home routers do not like this type data as they are setup to manage heavy data at fast speeds. Not Constant small packets with the occasional burst of data for chunk generation. This will fill your routers Cache and cause packets to get dropped. Locally if you connect via lan to your server it will be running perfectly but your friends will notice anything from no lag to lots of lag.

4502245,0,t1_csy4nvn,Alright heres some of what Im thinking in braindump form. When entering a dungeon everything in your inventory is left behind either dropped on the ground around the portal or just saved and restored I like dropping them on the ground. To bring items in with you you need to awaken the item. How this is done Ive not yet decided possible by killing all enemies on the first level or killing the first boss or adding a special item to a pedestal or spawning special mob more on that. There are two was Im thinking about to modify items. And two things that could be modified.. Crafting Every primal item items with no recipe will have an aspect. These aspects can be found in the item dungeon taken and put into other items. This could be used to craft other items for example taking a coal aspect and adding it to a stick would turn the stick into a torch. This would be how you craft advanced items in this mod. Aspects would be items on pedestals found at the end of each dungeon layer a piston would have  plank aspects  cobblestone aspects a iron and redstone aspect at the end of its dungoen.. EnchantingNBT data Things such as enchantments attack damage defence can be modified in the item dungeon as well. These will be in the form of mobs and be found deeper in the dungeon always deeper than the first layer possible always on the last layer. When killed these mobs always drop their egg or some object to respawn them. Each of these mobs will have a level corresponding how high a level their trait was i.e. a level  looting mob level  attack damage mob etc I want some way of increasing the level possible by combining them though this should be quite difficult. After capturing one of these you can add it to another item for example take the  attack from a diamond sword and add it too a wooden sword.,feedthebeast,csy5sp6,1,t5_2v620

The Chronotyper sorts Mobs by taking them from one area and putting them in another specifically in front of and behind the machine.In conclusion the Chronotyper would take baby pigs created by the adult pigs using the Breeder and put them in front of the Grinder which would kill the bred baby pigs once they became adults Because as far as Ive seen with similar setups grinders dont kill passive baby Mobs.This would slowly use your Carrots while creating Raw Pork then you could shove the pork into either a Culinary Generator or a Pink Generator That works right?.,feedthebeast,ct6alqr,3,t5_2v620

4612943,0,t3_3e55fo,Nanakisan it seems you and I have very similar playstyles. I like ic but only some of the new stuff.  I like finite water etc.  Im curious about mekanism though I thought most people complained that mekanism made things too easy?  The way you are talking you want a slower progression.  Painful motivator etc.  The pack I have been half assed working on also has finite water.  To make water scarce the simplest way is to use finite water or only use the BC pump and set it in the config to consume water and then disable all other pumps.  To make the pump require power to run it I was going to create a custom recipe for a basic buildcraft gate and then disable the redstone engine.  Then you can craft basic gates for pipes but without redstone engines no free water pumping.  You have to at least put a stirling engine on it.  Originally i was going to try increasing the power requirements of machines but few mods allow ways to do that.  So I am going with just making it much harder to produce power in big quantities.  Im hoping that a BC oil spout becomes like finding the Holy Grail.   Was also going to make machines cost a lot more metal to create.There was a new addon just made that puts the old enet back into IC if that is why you went back to Classic.  I do like the ore washing and stuff from Experimental.I like the BC lasers idea.  IMO autocrafting is not used much because regular crafting is not very hard AND you dont often need hundreds of the same thing.  not sure if this was the type of response you are looking for sorry. ,feedthebeast,ctc1j32,1,t5_2v620

Im going to ignore the platform on top because that would need its own post.In my opinion a good place to start would be to seperate the platform on the top from the support with either a wall going around the platform or by insetting the support a good  to  blocks. I recommend the former along with changing out the supports for something a bit more sturdy looking like Chisels factory blocksAdditionally on the corner facing the ocean you didnt actually make that a pillar you just crossed  beams and left it like that. Change that to be a solid pillar and it would also make it look more solid. Gangways around the middle point of the build would break up the monotony of your build.To me it looks like an oil rig we have out in the Gulf Coast I would look at that image and maybe take some insperation?The platform is fucking terrible for the simple fact its a plain platform and looks like you didnt try at all so Im leaving that alone.,feedthebeast,ctcq6pm,4,t5_2v620

4786964,0,t3_3gg439,I might be in the minority here but I like working with multiple power systems. Back in the .. days I liked to use IC for processing and tools and BCRCForestry for resource gathering and moving things around. Making the two systems work together was part of the fun.    RF has simplified things in a lot of ways but part of the problem with that is that it feels like it has homogenized the experience. It seems that the goal of any kitchen sink pack these days is to generate and arbitrarily high amount of RFt and then fill an AE system before carrying on with other tasks. I know this is a its a sandbox play it how you want issue but I think that variety in this case by bringing back MJs can only make it better.,feedthebeast,ctxxpfw,13,t5_2v620
4787211,0,t3_3gg439,Heres my take on it Make engines put out their RF with each pumping motion again. Same RF per pumping motion but faster pumping after heating up. Include problems with overheating again. Your buildcraft machines use power but they have a nice and interesting twist.  If they receive power in a constant stream they lose efficiency with each tick. Imagine after receiving power  ticks in raw the power consumption for progress could increase for each further tick obviously give it a cap. This also encourages you to make redstone contraption to not accidently have your engines run in such a way but thats min maxing just a few ticks back to back wouldnt do much harm.gt With well tweaked numbers on that mechanic Buildcraft engines and hopfeully forestry and raiclraft ones will be more efficient at least for Buildcraft machines even if other options beat them on a per tick basis.gt You can still hook into other RF sources if you cap that mechanic in a reasonable waygt Your engines obviously also still work for other RF machines. Obviously those machines would still need a RF per tick cap as well I think. So a cryo Flcdcut cant just insta fill it up. But of important note would be that this cap would be based on the adjusted input and not the actual progress the machine makes. If your machine can only make RFtick progress but you reach lets say a .x multiplier due to multiple ticks in a row the max it could pull from a cryofluxduct would be RF while basically only giving RF to the machine.Does that sound reasonable? Or am I missing something. I just hope there are no redstone things that trigger for exactly one tick. That would be lame...edit I actually have a better idea with a similar concept. Will work it out out completely this time.,feedthebeast,ctxytq0,6,t5_2v620

Lack of in game document make it hard to learn the tech tree in gregtech you really need to do lots of search online to just begin the gregtech. I do agree the multiblock structure is very fun to build. The bug I experience is the gregtech machine stop randomly sometime you need to break and replace the multiblock structure in order to make it works again. Also sometimes when I open the UI of gregtech machine it crash the game. Lately I quit the TPPI series. Not an offense. People hate it will just hate it. People love hardcore like you will love it. I try to play hardcore but die horribly so I quit. I am not a hardcore player like you. Even I know the gregtech tech tree in TPPI but the processing time of gregtech machine is way too slow and it require a super long time to go to the next tech tree. Sure it make fun for hardcore player but for most player it add so much pain. Again people love it will love it people hate it will hate it.

5176917,0,t3_3lv2qp,Vaz just a quick thought on this. A lot of the larger mod packs change this config because getting the petals and doing the flowers over and over is a bit tedious. Would a better change be to make passive flowers decay into non generating versions of those flowers which can be dropped into a mana pool to be regenerated? This could then be automated with botania keep the feeling of the mod and perhaps provide some very creative builds. I think with that change people would expect more mana from passive flowers as they require more active  and planned set ups for operation. Just a thought.Edit before people say this will lead to babysitting whilst it may do very early game it can also be automated with vanilla and botania.,feedthebeast,cva0bfe,1,t5_2v620

My opinion is that what you think the theme is which you seem to think is its classic Tekkit and what the description of the theme says Its tekkit but with new stuff too do not match.    Am I wrong? What do you think the theme of the pack as intended by the author is?    Another opinion I have is that you didnt read the description of the pack which shows the theme of the pack assumed a different theme which is not reconcilable with the theme of the pack so its not surprising why you think Big Reactor doesnt fit the theme of the pack and panicked when you saw Big Reactor in the mod list so you came in to take a shit on players who play or use Big Reactor.

5327242,0,t1_cvsl8wv,Hey FyberOptic thanks for all these questions. Will answer as best as I can. As things stand the FTB Shop is totally independent of the deal with Curse however its an interesting concept that we could look into to see if its possible.. With regards to the forum I think we all agree that before we can use it for FTB it needs to be improved a lot. I have no idea if this gives you any confidence or not however before we move over to the Curse software we have to sign off on it and Captainnana who runs that side of things for us is very very fussy. I have no plans to sign off on that move until we are happy the software is in a place it needs to be in. On this note it should be said that in no way have Curse tried to push us into doing anything including moving to the new forums until we are totally comfortable in doing so.Re Curse points I dont have the answers for you but I will pass this question onto Kaeten and see if I can get an answer for you.Same goes for the budget will pass question on and see if I can get an answer.Same for the Paypal question sorry these are not in my area but if I can get answers I willYes we have fallback plans if something does go bad with curse for some weird reason. With regards to Operating Systems the answer is the same today as it was  months ago. Mac support of the client is essential thats never changed. We want Linux support Kaelten wants Linux support and the current method that they are trying for Mac support if successful will enable them to easily translate that into Linux supprt as well.  But we have to face reality windows makes ip  of our userbase. Mac makes up  of our user base and Linux makes up  of our userbase. This makes it very hard for Curse to commit absolutely to a Linux solution thats why we have always said if they cant provide a working solution then we would find an alternative way of downloading FTB packs.The API is trickier from my point of view as I am not directly involved in that side of things it is more a technical question which other people are handling.Jadedcat and Eyamaz are both now full time Curse Employees I am sure there isnt a problem naming the others but let me confirm and ill edit it in later. Rajecent from Weallplaycast has joined as a volunteer to handle the Content Creator stuff as we go forwards. Next year we will lose the FTB Launcher this is a huge loss for is in terms of publicising our packs. I want to make sure that we make up for that by making the best packs we can and having the right people around me to help keep FTB packs at the top.I hope these answers are sufficient until I can get more information for you.,feedthebeast,cvsm7sf,1,t5_2v620

Wood smelts to charcoal burns to steam powers the turbine which powers the furnaces and farms. Excess saplings can be turned into BioFuel and turned into power from that or ethanol I believe. Or a simple Big Reactor. Large enough ones can sustain MFR Laser Drills with yellow foci to automatically get its own fuel though may take a sorting system sans AE set up.There are various Culinary Generator setups out there. Clever use of Autonomous Activators can get you Salt Water and Milk. Grow whatever crops you need substituting Soy Beans for any meat through use of pressers and autocraft with Cyclic Assemblers or Ender IO Crafters.

For example the Windmakers baubles charge when at ygt. The windmakers ring gives you flight the pendant negates fall damage and using a hotkey shoots you up in the air super fast and the belt is basically a shitty sojourner sash.

5467835,0,t1_cwaixs0,gt Now what does a duct do that a train cannot?Sans EnderIO conduits TD Ducts Buildcraft pipes and all the like short distance fluid insertion and extraction. If my memory is right you can move fluids around with either Steves Carts or Railcraft and they end up in the LoaderUnloader. However there is no mechanism for pulling fluids from those blocks. Item pulling is possible with vanilla hoppers but I dont believe its possible to pull fluids. So things like large Steam Boilers and stuff become so unwieldy to use that theyre worthless because youd have to input buckets by hand. And even though items are possible the nature of hoppers makes them irritating to deal with imo and restricts the way you can build things arbitrarily. Theres no actual difficulty its just more irritating to do. The part you ignore about Minechem in your point by the way is that it requires a significant investment of iron to get the basic blocks. And those blocks require a large amount of rf which likely requires some sort of metal to make dynamos or something. And even then youre quite limited by what resources you have on hand since you likely need something to create obscene rft to power the multiblocks that will let you get access to everything. Whereas Ex Nihilos sieving is built entirely off tree products wood and leaf drops silk wormgtsilky leavesgtstring.

Etherium isnt drained until the operation tick see note . I recommend setting up a chest next to it so it has a place to export the fish.. If the UI Text is green then its configured in the right way as far as power and connected flickers this doesnt include surroundings checks.

5652971,0,t3_3siqpm,If I were to make the most minimal modpack Id even contemplate playing it would be Buildcraft Railcraft Forestry Witcherypossibly adding Storage Drawers too... And playing without NEI InvTweaks and a mapmod  Im sticking with mapwriter  would just feel wrong. Oh and WAILA too ofcThis would exclude a lot of mods I do love Botania TC TE XU comes to mind but it would still offer a great deal of options and things to dobuild.To answer your requirements The BC gates  pipwire system to handle redstone is fantastic. BC pipes arent laggy anymore. Thats something that has stuck around even after they got better optimized. In terms of power generation I find BC oilfuel and Forestry biomassethanol very entertaining. Youd also get access to RC steamboilersengines. Witchery will handle teleportation both in overworld and interdimensionally in two ways Rite of Transposition and a more direct form in Infusion of Otherwhere. RC has the Steam Trap great for a mob farm. It wouldnt be hard to figure out a way to mobfarm with Witchery either.This will give you quite a lot to tinker with and even some kind of adventuring with witchery. But it seems this would be much smaller than you are prepared to play with hehe...Edit by the way Witchery actually has a great deal to offer when you arent using the mass of mods most popular packs include. WerewolfVampireInfernal Infusion can provide you with runspeed the Broom for flight infernal infusion can also provide you with flight as can Vampire and a demonic contract for at least a chance at ore doubling.Edit I just keep coming up with more stuff this collection actually can provide that people perhaps wont find obvious. BC can do autocrafting I often forget about that one and if you make a quarry with a hobgoblin equipped with a koboldite pick it will both get autosmelted and doubled. Use silk touch and give it to your leashed hobgoblin to double the stuff you mine yourself.,feedthebeast,cwxt1fd,3,t5_2v620

All i takes takes to clear would be making a decent sword and Upgraded dark steel armorand a regen  potion for withers.Only problem is you might run into a dead end where having farmed some nether starts before hand comes in handy.Its way easier then it sounds. Use a Autospawner to spawn wither skeletons and kill the wither in the runic dungeon where it cant fly away.

It would be very early game interestingly unreliable versions of common utilities.Like rocket pack that allowed you to boost once after jumping but would sometimes cause you to fly in the wrong direction or just not work.Or a pair of boots that allowed you to step up blocks but often you would trip and get slowed for a quarter second or so.Or a builders wand that sometimes would cause a block to fall after a few ticks just enough time for you to step out onto it.Or a wand of equal trade that would sometimes make mistakes and place a random block from your inventory instead of the one you want.Or a item akin to the golden bag of holding that would require you to search through the bag to show a random set of  items so you would likely have to search a lot to find the item you want.

Convert RF to EU with Immersive Engineering cables.Just keep in mind if you go for solar that its a long term investment. The  EUt panel I mentioned will take a little over  hours of continuous daynight operation to pay back the iridium used in its construction.There are plenty of other options for the reactors if you want to move beyond Mark I.

5887155,0,t1_cxrbn5b,Im thinking around  years!Nah its not as bad as people think to be honest. I had a few hours one evening and got a smeltery and a couple of machines going. Its quite easy at first. My main time gate was steel. But thats only because you have to hunt for the mats for the blast furnace. I was lucky enough to find a block of steel under an angry spider tree of doom and that meant I wasnt so eager to rush it but still didnt take a huge amount of time.Two things should be noted here In the same chest I found a Rubber tree sapling not a sacred one but still a very large one and planted it next to my base not knowing how big it would grow so a large area outside my base is perpetually in shadow and I get a lot of mob spawns to farm.

Also for enderium automate the EnderIO recipe much easier and less chance of fucking up badly.    But please do not give advices like this one. Just because you dont like andor you were not able to make it work properly does not mean no one should use it!    LP is not a new mod that just appeared a couple weeks ago and its full of bugs. Its a mod that exists for years.  of the problems are usually player missconfiguration and not a mod related problem. Just because you dont like something does not give you the right to not recommend its use. Its a VERY biased opinion so you should not give it!    You will not use it anymore ok.

I got one in a Safari Net and spawned it in a controlled environment. With the taint goo I made Vitium essence to use in making Bottled Taint.

6081160,0,t1_cygpvlt,Its interesting. I was looking for a challenging pack that didnt have a lot of actual difficulty like making the player travel to different dimensions for items but I also wanted a pack with the old FTB Ultimate feel to it. Infinity is just that and while very grindy forces the player on an admittedly fun linear progression of each and every major mod in the pack. The only downside to the pack is that everything once youve established the earlygame machines is VERY expensive and youll often times find yourself mining for hours to get a couple of small blocks. But after you can afford the power requirements for a quarry the pack takes a major shift towards forcing the player to automate EVERYTHING which to me is quite fun. Ive played over  hours of realtime so far and havent even touched midgame yet. For me its highly addictive and adds a lot of playtime to a pack that I would be endgame in less than  hours in normally.I hope that didnt scare you away P,feedthebeast,cygq0m5,6,t5_2v620

6155915,0,t1_cyp9130,Are you kidding? Im looking forwards to it. Ive been playing mods since before Forge and while initially having powersystem compatibility seemed like the best thing ever the result has been ... actually pretty disappointing.Power systems used to have mechanics. IC had its voltages and packets MJ couldnt be stored and had to be watched or itd explode and nobody ever used Blutricity when that became a thing but it was an actual simulation of electricity with amperage and voltage.RF unified everything sure  but what you get when you blend everything together is a bland slurry. Now power is a single number and if any mod wants to do something interesting with how it treats power some other mod will neutralize it. Any power costs are made essentially meaningless by some other mod adding an even more powerful generator and the expectation that everybodys going to be playing every mod in some massive modpack means everything has to be balanced around that assumption.In any case though its not looking very likely. Everybodys still just going to keep using the RF API. ,feedthebeast,cypd2un,3,t5_2v620

Again...so  minutes to write out the permission request is a waste of time? Ok then how about the time you put into making the pack check. The time put into testing the pack check. The time put into configuring the pack check. The time put into making a map for the pack check. The time put into originally selecting your mods check.    So after all of this time wasted as you so put it in gathering permissions. Only a few minor minutes is considered a waste? when some people have put over several hundred hours into a packs construction. You cannot be patient for only a few simple minutes? Granted you do have to wait a little bit for the response. But look at it as a moment to take a break.    You act like making a modpack is a business and that every second should not be wasted. Well sadly that is not the case. If you dont like mods with those types of permissions. Then simply do not use them.

6176674,0,t3_405185,Heres what I think is a key aspect of Harvestcraft its generalist nature. Its in a bunch of different packs and its played by a bunch of different people for a bunch different reasons. Looking at the comments makes this pretty clear theres people saying they want it to be more like TFC and theres people who only use the easiest or most efficient foods anyway. With the Harvestcraft of today thats fine its simplicity allows for a lot of freedom with different playstyles which is why its in so many modpacks. If youre gonna change things I think its important to think through where you want to go with the mod. Do you keep going with this generalist nature or do you want to introduce cool new features that might push it a certain way?For instance Id love it if you were to add modular foods or crafting that isnt UIheavy think Flaxbeards Steampower The Kitchen Mod Ex Nihilo hell even Tinkers Construct. I can see the automationheavy people having issues with that though. But Im at a stage where Im looking for a very lowtech playstyle so Ill gladly farm and craft everything manually.You can keep a lot of this generalist nature by adding loads of customisation options trough a config or a different way working on mod compatibility Id suggest doing both of these anyway and adding content that gives you more freedom rather than doing things a certain way I personally wouldnt use the RFpowered machines someone mentioned but as long as Im not forced to use them I dont care. Still at some point you might have to make this choice if you want to keep with the generalist nature or if you want to push it in a certain direction to explore new things. And dont be fooled theres no right or wrong answer to the question.,feedthebeast,cyrq2bp,2,t5_2v620

6178758,0,t1_cyrw9fh,You are right something challenging will consume time mostly because you invest time in order to train and prepare yourself for the challenge.   push ups are a challenge. You have to prepare your body to be able to pull it off. One may not be able to pull it off the first time you will fail but you will eventually succeed with enough time invested.  The best Minecraft analogy I can come up with in this context are IC reactors and BigReactors. Yes I know you can simply look for the most efficient reactor online but one would simply be skipping the challenging part here. Experimenting blowing something up and learning from it is a challenge. Youll eventually find a good reactor and fan setup. You may even be able to improve it over time.  Mindlessly pressing left click for hours to no end because you cant find that one piece of ore is not challenging. Its tedious time consuming and does not help you progress in any way or form you may even be setting yourself back.

The wiki also shows how many coils you need for a given material assuming  mBt input. Enderium needs  Ludicrite needs . Ludicrite turbine only needs xx dimensions Enderium needs xx which means it needs to be built vertically unless you do a x Shape does not matter but coils only count in the  blocks around the rotor shaft.

It seems like every half step you take in one mod you need  other things from another mod and to get some of those things you need to go back to the others. Its a lot of boring backandforth.Id probably be a lot less irritated if all four werent so heavily intertwined through recipes.  Like please let me get to some of the interesting stuff before getting so tedious because in the beginning it just seems like way too much legwork before you get anywhere remotely fun. Or pick two and have them use each other quite a bit and the other two sparingly bigger pieces for bigger parts. For example have Botania and Thaumcraft rely heavily on each others materials and require Witchery or Blood Magic stuff just every now and then instead of every other recipe.

6473253,0,t1_czol0gw,PP is one of those things that eventually just clicks but it can take a while for that to happen. Its also really easy to confuse yourself if you dont do things very methodically. Say for example that I wanted to wire up a data storage room with  different devices but its a good distance from the controller. Rather than spending a fortune on running dense cable the whole way I run ME glass cable all the way from the controller to my data center. Once I have that in place I remove the piece of glass cable thats touching the controller and plonk a PP tunnel onto the end of the glass cable. I use a memory card to save its settings this is basically just saying this is going to be one end of my tunnel then stick a dense cable on the controller so it runs into the PP tunnel. That compresses all  channels down into a single channel that can easily be carried by the glass cable.On the data center end Id probably have a dense cable running along the bottom edge of the room so I can connect drives all along its length.  The ME glass cable should run right up to  block away from its end and the other PP tunnel will go on the end of the glass cable since the tunnel is running through the glass cable the tunnels go on its ends rather than on the dense cable. Use the memory card to load the saved settings from the tunnel at the other end this will link them. Finally add one more bit of dense cable to actually connect to the PP tunnel and youre done! You now have  channels to play with in your data center. The cool thing is that if you ever need more channels you can put one more sending tunnel on the glass cable at the controller end and one more receiving tunnel on it at the data center end hook up a different dense cable to it and now you have  channels running through a simple ME glass cable.Shitty ASCII diagram    |                 |                           ||                           |                 | Dense cable   Glass cable  | PP tunnel   Controller  I spread out the dense cables a bit just to make it clear that the top bottom and sides arent connected but honestly you could just have the PP tunnels on that end connected directly to the controller if you wanted.,feedthebeast,czovoug,2,t5_2v620

The Mekanism fusion reactor is weirdI think that the output is really only dependent upon how much of the input materials you can produce so it may be able to be somewhat competitive against the Reactorcraft reactor.But keep in mind three things RotaryReactorcraft stuff is actually realistic and is fun to play with and looks pretty cool!.

Dare to step out of your comfort zone. If you notice you always go for a mod first then dont use that mod at least not right away.Mods make it very easy to become lazy in solving problems.As a good suggestion take a look at the Botania challenges. Imagine setting yourself similar challenges using mods you are not too familiar with but have an idea on what they can do.For example currently I am playing mostly magic based modpacks Simply Magic is the current one. Im trying to come up with a decent way to automate my mining. Mostly because I hate grind.Im working my way up to either creating my resources with Botania or makign the challenge quarry.

6688818,0,t3_478zua,Ok Ill break this down for you and guide you how to unify ingots and ores in a modpack. Its pretty straight forward but youre gonna have to do some Minetweaking and config editing.  First of all  gt is oreDictionary a mod  No its not.  The ore dictionary is a method included in Forge that allows mods to register items so that multiple mods can be cross compatible.  If you were to install Forge and no mods at all then even vanilla ores and ingots would have oreDict values such as ingotIron.  Forge adds a bunch of defaults but there are no strict requirements. If you were to make your own mod with your own custom ore you could register it with whatever oreDict value you wish like oreCustom  Ok so now that we understand why oreDict values exist we can understand how to edit them via a mod like Minetweaker.  With MT you can add AND remove oreDict values. So in the above example ingotIron you could write a MT script that removes that value.  Now lets say you have a recipe that uses any ingotIron and you removed the ingotIron oreDict value from vanilla iron. Well now you wont be able to use vanilla iron ingots in recipes that use ironIngot.  When it comes to unifying ores and ingots in a modpack its simply a matter of ensuring that only one ore generates in your world and that all recipes can use all available ingots of a single type.  What I usually do is find out which ore is most compatible with all of my mods. Sometimes you might have say copper ore from  different mods but for some reason copper ore from one of the mods is more compatible across all of the mods. Its gonna require thumbing through NEI and checking the usage of your ores and ingots but its worth it to keep everything unified.  Once you determined which mod ore you want  say copper ore from IE  then go into the configs of all the mods you DONT want to spawn copper ore and just disable it.  Sometimes configs wont have options to disable ore spawning in which case you might have to just go with that mod  Although most wellwritten mods will have configs for ores.  Now for ingots and such youre just gonna have to ensure all the ingots of a single type share the same oreDict value. So all copper ingots should have ingotCopper for example. Doesnt matter what the value is so long as its the same across all ingots of the same kind and all recipes use that value.  This is why its a good idea to stick to whatever the defaults or commonly used versions are since most mods tend to stick with what makes most sense.  Most mods are good about using oreDict values for recipes like using ingotCopper for recipes but its not always the case. This is why its important to check the recipe usage for all of your ingots. If anything is missing youre gonna have to use MT to add the recipe and do so using the oreDict values when possible.  Last thing is to check balancing. Make sure for example the copper ore in mod A isnt way cheaper to get than from mod B.  One final note regarding your OP  no you cant have two items sharing the same ID. For the most part IDs dont even matter anymore. They are in fact randomly assigned when creating a new world. Exception is biome IDs spell effects and enchants and meta values. They still have fixed values.,feedthebeast,d0b6kpf,4,t5_2v620

6769811,0,t1_d0jffr5,We dont really have a single real life magic system because IRL magic just doesnt work.    If it were realist magic mods would only have placebo effects.    Youd see a regeneration icon but you wouldnt regenerate.    Tech mods are expected to adhere to somewhat loose physics.  Steam is steam people dont care if your mod wants its own steam its steam.  Torque is torque electricity is RF forces are forces etc.  If people really wanted to mess with all this they have to start saying that RF is basically volts hz and this other mod is using V Hz or something. But next thing you know converters exist because converters loosely make physical sense.    If you want to do a tech mod and not be bothered as much by people then call it magic and just make things like furnaces look like other unrelated things.  Maybe they could be star fragments assemble with magic powder.  And those star things just produce star power by burning coal or from moonlight or even by consuming cakes maybe.  Since its magic you can waive anything in your design as well its magic.    Basically do like Botania did. Its magic I can do what I want.  And Im not saying its a bad way to go about it I meant it factually that its a legit strategy.

I was able to stagger it by turning  levers on with a delay between but this is finicky and would reset whenever I logged out.I also tried out other types of vanillastyle spawners and the vanilla spawner also seems to not always produce  mobs leading me to believe this may be an issue inherent in these types of spawners no matter what.Oddly enough t soul cages from the soul shards reborn mod seem to always produce  mobs when given the correct room so having multiples of these may be whats necessary to get exact mobs   seconds.

Since Forestry is on github a link to their curse page should usually suffice. If youre on one of the popular launchers Curse FTB ATL those links are generated automatically on your mod page.If youre really in this license stuff I can go into more gory details upon request but this post has already been verbose enough. ,feedthebeast,d0tcprk,1,t5_2v620

But if you are concerned about that then slap a Diamond on it. Increases the mining level to  Obsidian  mining anything but Cobalt and ardite    By using a Cobald head you lose a LOT of modifiers making the hammer far slower.  ,feedthebeast,d0tt0d8,2,t5_2v620

6891566,0,t1_d0xcmqi,Thaumcraft and Blood Magic are beginning to feel the least appealing to me for my personal taste.But it sounds like Botania and Witchery would go very well together kind of fit into each others themes as well.Could you maybe explain a bit more on how to do an Endoflame setup? When I tried Botania I did get that far I had a bunch of Endoflame and whenever I needed mana I threw Coal at them to burn up. The Tutorial mentioned using the open crate and a hopper I never even heard of the hopper before dont think it existed last I played before picking the game up again. I did figure out that I could just throw coal into the hopper and the hopper would put it into the open crate... which would just spit it back out again? The ingame book mentions its for more precision of where the item will drop but I still didnt see the use of it. do you have to connect it to some timed system so it drops a coal every dozen of seconds when the Endoflame would be done?And yeah Witchery really seems to capture that feeling. When I first saw the mod I couldnt even believe how cool it sounded like This is it! The magic mod I always wanted! Rituals Magic Potions Demon summoning Infernal Contracts a spirit world etc. etc. etc. and it was the mod I tried out the most. But I really felt like I was hitting a wall and didnt feel like I was progressing at all or getting anything useful out of it. Like... I can do a ritual to summon lightning neat... or set up a small dome of protection... cool... I dunno Im probably missing a lot of potential here. But stuff like Vampirism or Lycantrophy required such high amounts of mana in the Altar and resources that just seem out of reach.And it was very frustrating trying to farm for a Creeper Heart or a Wither Skull or even a regular skull.,feedthebeast,d0xh6dx,2,t5_2v620

7139669,0,t1_d1po5zn,Your botania example shows exactly what the problem is.  If botania had a way to easily convert RF to mana no one would ever make endoflames or thermalillies.  They would run magmatic engines from nether lava then run a pipe over to the coverter and start filling up mana pools.  The problem is the game is like Pandoras Box... once opened its hard to go backwards.  If there had never been a way to teleport liquids from one dimension to another and lava power had stayed kind of a pain to use no onewould mind.  But if a mod pack dev does it now its seen as a nerf and people get irritated.  Although... expert mode is popular which surprises the hell out of me.  So maybe people are finally getting tired of things being super easy.  My ultimate point was... if RF had started with a default that was more middle of the road no one would ever notice.  But for a mod like BC to now make pipes harder only some of us will enjoy that for many others they will say why would i use that over leadstone pipes they are much more superior.  ,feedthebeast,d1ppbt3,1,t5_2v620

7252342,0,t3_4er60l,I was so proud to declare that I had ported the last RFTools block from .. to ..And then I found out that I forgot one block. The storage scanner. I dont know how manyof you know that block as it is not that spectacular. In .. it was an easy way tofind missing items. It could scan all inventories in the neighbourhood and you could searchfor items. Then you could hilight the inventories that contain those items. So I almostdecided not to port this block. But then I thought what if I add a few features...One of the disadvantages of the storage scanner was that it had no way to extract orinsert items in any of the inventories. So you could use it to find your chest or whateverbut thats about it. This has now changed. It has a request ability. When you find youritem in one of the adjacent inventories you can now request that item from that inventoryand fetch it out of the extraction slot.In addition it can now also transfer items to inventories if they are input in theinsertion slot. In the screenshot above you can see a hopper feeding in items from aquarry for example. They get inserted in the insertion slot and then the storage scannerwill try to find a suitable inventory to insert it. It will scan inventories from topto bottom and you can reorder the inventories for priorities.In addition the storage blocks have been retrofitted with an item filter a featurethat was present in .. but not widely known. The scanner respects that filter andwill thus insert the items in the right storage block. For example in the setup shownhere all stone blocks will go to the first storage block and all ores to the second one.The rest will go to the remaining blocks.So now I hope Im close to a real . release Edit RFTools .beta  Needs McJtyLib ..,feedthebeast,d22jfes,33,t5_2v620

Target audience here varies WILDLY.With that in mind most of the userbase will work with whatever is easier to understand and less tedious to go through. Some mods are niche and address everyone not in the mainstream general group. In these niches there are even deeper and smaller niches and so on.Its the nature of things. If your mod is not the easiest to pick up expect it to catter to a smaller audience there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.Also there is absolutely nothing wrong with multiple systems and stuff as creating mods is a hobby and everyone is entitled to their own opinion and design preferences.,feedthebeast,d25swht,7,t5_2v620

7354389,0,t1_d2e4r61,Its diminishing returns since the transfer isnt instant only very quick. As you add more world interaction it takes longer before it can grab the next batch. This needs to be offset with speed upgrades. From what Ive seen I think theres basically two clocks working. periodically checking if the world interaction can pull more cobble into the node. . the search algorithm trying to move cobble out of the node. At  world interaction  so everything syncs up nicely and you see a constant  cobble flowing.As you add more world interaction gt happens you then need to offset this with speed upgrades otherwise  will be skipping every other attempt to run because there is still cobble in the node.This means that whilst there is a general upwards trend when adding world and speed upgrades there are points where your return will either jump or plumet as a threshold is breached.Either way the best cost is no object setup is  full stacks of world interaction and gt speed upgrades.

It takes a color frequency cobblestone and an apple to craft. Once crafted you can put any item in it. The item in the dev null will collect up to a stack and then void any excess. A second handy inventory management item is luggage. Having a chest follow you around is good for those excess drops. ,feedthebeast,d2xuyo4,6,t5_2v620

You can look at the example dungeons I made they are included in the PG pack.The procedural generation  branching features in MCW are pretty advanced but they arent fully documented yet and can be a bit hard to use thats the only drawback.

This isnt the same scene it used to be.  Its grown.  People are less and less likely to look things up on wikis when so many mods document ingame.I think its better to embrace the new and document then hold to the old ways and tell those new players to just look it up.

Not to mention not everyone goes to Reddit and checks up on the latest news and the fact that this change is not readily apparent unless you scroll all the way to the bottom shows a blatant attempt at using dark patterns to highly encourage people to accidentally download the curse app.I get this is the age of Windows s forced upgrades and all but lets not bring that to Minecraft too.,feedthebeast,d4b1lih,8,t5_2v620

I thought the config files would have it but they dont seem to.I noticed they went from ProjectE .. to .. so perhaps something fundamentally changed.

8122671,0,t1_d4srm19,Yeah Ive been thinking about that as well. For the most part when I started putting these mods together I just grabbed whatever I thought could be interesting with the intention of trimming it down after some alpha testing. I do kind of want both magic and tech mods in the packI know some people think of that as a big nono but Im thinking of the pack having some sort of backstory with a history of war between science and magic. Some of the mods are there with consideration that its a limited resource pack for example magical crops and moo fluids both of which I forgot to list in the above post. Magical crops or MFR wouldve been fine for ore sustainability on their ownMFR has the laser drilland I initially was going to go for just magical crops if I hadnt added moo fluids. Personally I love automating and MFR has an addon specifically for automating moo fluids. I did throw a couple of mods in there just because I rarely see them in packs and they looked interesting but as I said I definitely plan on trimming some of these. Big Reactors probably wont remain in this pack for example.,feedthebeast,d4t27j6,2,t5_2v620

A bound sword would be even better at  damage but would cost blood and youd need progress in Blood Magic to get it. A TiCon Manyullyn sword could also work.A strength effect should help you significantly. Even with the nerf Strength II will add a lot of bonus damage to your strikes so if you can use it you should.However maximizing damage might not work forever since IIRC the Guardian still caps incoming damage.

8163806,0,t1_d4xybj4,I wasnt specifying just your GPU but the bottleneck is somewhere in the hardware. Those cryo ducts are expensive when it comes to computer resources and you have tons and tons of them. Im kind of assuming that all the ducts Im seeing in the picture are connected together? Thermal Dynamics ducts are mutliblocks so the more complex a line of ducts is the more taxing it is for the hardware to calculate what is going on with with them. I also believe but dont know for certain that because those ducts are multiblocks the code is calling for the entire line to be rendered even if you cant see all the ducts. Try breaking down your power grid into smaller pieces and use some tesseracts to move power from the primary storage location to the other areas where power is needed. Make sure there is never a loop in any cable. You should always be able to go from the start to the end without a possibility of a situation where you could find yourself in an infinite loop. ,feedthebeast,d4y0vfx,1,t5_2v620

8412959,0,t1_d5rrdns,Which is it or have you not decided or is it undefined which would actually happen?  One of those allows heat sink type scenarios though I cant think of a reason youd need one ATM while the other could potentially be used to make builds more compact by running intersecting heat transfers....It occurs to me that there is a better or at least more internally consistent than heat tiers unrelated to actual heat present way to fix the problem.  The setup in question works in v because of two things. Heat Lamps stack that is multiple heat lamps cause the attached machine to hit the target temp faster and stay there under greater stress.  This effect is the only thing keeping the hot machines hot enough to drive the steam boiler against the heat being pulled out to drive the steam boiler.. Heat Adjacency Cores favor transferring heat across the widest temperature differential so every hot machine you put on another side makes the transfer to the cold one substantially faster.Both of those are necessary for that kind of setup to be at all effective.  Breaking either or both of the magic blocks involved seems less inconsistent than breaking what heat is.  You know one of the bits thats supposed to represent a real thing that exists?You could always make heat lamps check when placedremoved for other heat lamps and disable all but one attached or as you are so fond of with Rotarycraft stuff simply explode violently.  Throw in a line on the heat lamp description about multiple heat lamps heating the same block interfering with each others portokali emissions and so being strongly warned against.Then additionally make the heat adjacency core less efficient at transferring heat from multiple hot blocks to one comparatively cool block such that stacking multiple hot machines around one doesnt speed up the heating of another attached machine by much.  You could just have it favor smaller heat differentials when it decides what to transfer if you wanted to minimize the amount of hankypanky involved in doing this can explain what I mean in more detail if needed.  Or just make the heat adjacency cores a bit lossy.Between the two it might not eliminate heat lamps indirectly driving steam boilers but if it doesnt itd cut the efficiency of it enough to not be outrageous especially given it requires lategame Chromaticraft.  I mean midgame Chromaticraft gets you to removing permanent Thaumcraft taint and generating functionally infinite essentia from energy.  You can dupe items for relatively small amounts of lumens in lategame Chromaticraft.  Even that isnt top tier. ,feedthebeast,d5t5wid,1,t5_2v620

Not together though add they are both super massive tech mods that do almost everything the others do and then some.Even with one of those I still use ender io and thermal expansion along side them both have some unique machines and features no one else does.,feedthebeast,d6jhk28,4,t5_2v620

8701279,0,t3_4z6pgr,Start putting bulk items like that into barrelsdrawers. I love Storage Drawers for early game sorting. Cobble can be put into a Compacting Drawer to compress it automatically. You can also upgrade the Drawers to automatically void things once they are full.The purpose of the cosmetic blocks is to serve as building materials. If you decide to build something out of one say marble you can all of a sudden need LOADS of it. So upgrading a Storage Drawer for each of them is a good idea IMO.Much later I recommend setting up automated trashing of items. Using AE in combo with Storage Drawers makes it easy and cheap to format storagescompared to making disks for every item. Then you can simply use the priority mechanic to void items once the main storages are full. Or use the void upgrades on the Drawers P,feedthebeast,d6tajcj,21,t5_2v620

Yes it is the pack makers responsibility to balance it for specialized packs but as a mod author myself balance is a major focus point.

8969189,0,t1_d7pxnt6,I agree. Honestly I think that Forge Energy is a net good  the history of RF sort of demonstrates that energy is in such widespread use that standardization is probably for the best. And having a forgedriven energy API could streamline things for a lot of mod authors old and new. But I think the people who disagree or have reservations are also correct  I think its going to be a net good but there is an obvious drawback. Itll free a lot of mod authors to focus on other aspects of gameplay but itll make it harder for people with new or unique power systems to gain traction.Again net good IMHO. But there are drawbacks.P.S. For what its worth Im a terrible offender at violating theme. I tend to play massive kitchen sink packs and play with crossmod interactions to do terrible things with balance. And a lot of that wouldnt be possible without a nearlyuniversal energy system backing most of what I play with. On an entirely selfish level Im for FE.

The mining spells also have an upper bound of harvest level defined in the config which defaults to iron level I believe.gtSpells that summon lightning end PvP or most monster confrontations extremely quickly.Combat is a joke with anything modded past really earlygame especially around vanilla mobs. Get a jetpack and you dont even have to look at the mobs.Trick Smite is also relatively expensive so it suffers from an enhanced cooldown of how long it takes for your energy to recharge.

Many other mods have their teleportation objects gated much later and often have a nonregenerating cost even if its just RF.How do you teleport with Psi again? I dont remember having anything like that in there. If anything youre talking about Blink which just warps you a few blocks in front of you.

Otherwise if it is for a prior version Tinkers and if the formulas still work you can add in materials fairly quickly. The tabs along the bottom you can add new traits parts material stats and such and it should work. As for the modifier slots I had left that out as the ..x Tinkers gives  slots for all tools.

The moment the coal is consumed the redstone signal stops and the crate drops more coal.So all you need to do is hook up a supply of coalcharcoal to the crate at this point.If you have a treefarm you can easily hook up an infinite charcoal supply and if you are on a server this might even give you all the mana you will ever need yet not that fast.

But overall the time to set up each quarry kept people usually from going crazy quarrying up ores with no setup time it seems convenient but it also means a lot more block changes etc.  I dont see why the rftools and ex utils quarries even remove ores from the world itself all it is doing is causing pointless strain on the server.   I know the BC builder was accused of creating lag due to the sound an rftools quarrybuilder works much faster and you also hear the sound of the block being placed each time.

Industry Gigant note that it uses GT so thats what youd be learning still in beta so currently the quests only reach a few tiers up the tech tree none of the high end stuff has quests yet. More significantly it does do some things differently as it is a focused quest pack it does integrate RotaryCraft and ReactorCraft with GT a bit so a couple of items require GT stuff that wouldnt normally but more significantly its built around a trading mechanic. Instead of ores spawning in the world or hostile mobs dropping loot you use a trading machine to get raw resources from hostile mobsores and process those into goods which you can trade back for more money for more resources and so on.Means youll miss the ore searching in comparison to normal and the lack of a nether or end along the goal does change things but it is still the only pack I know of that focuses on both those mods together.,feedthebeast,d943r2r,1,t5_2v620

The big reactors are so efficient that you quickly get to the point of This is enough fuel to last until the heat death of the universe. The MFR blocks are so easy and powerful that the only thing better in any meaningful way would be a creative strongbox.Good fast cheap pick two. To balance reactors on that scale...Fast and cheap Have them consume their coolant over time so you have one more thing you need to pump into them to keep them running.  Good and cheap Reactors have to be much larger the size of the average base for a small big reactor.  Good and fast Reactors require diamonds to build so the huge reactors will require stacks of diamonds.This could be broken down to more complex balancing factors like dividing fast into both production rate and how much player attention it takes to build kind of stuff.If anything Id be very interested to see a separate mod that adjusts configurations between different mods for balance. ,feedthebeast,d956wr6,1,t5_2v620
9381803,0,t3_590q0a,The pure vanilla way to do this gets complicated for what you want. Mostly because hoppers cant move items upwards. You need a form of item elevator or modded pipes.Hoppers can input items into other blocks. If the hopper aims at the top of a vanilla chest itll send the items to the input. If it goes to the side it goes to fuel. A hopper under a furnace will pull the output.Using this you could have a chest thathas a hopper that pulls wood and sends it to be smelted. Another hopper pulls the charcoal out and sends it elsewhere.To stay vanilla Next up you need an item elevator. Instead of a storage chest send the items to a dispenser aimed up. That dispenser when given a Redstone pulse will send items into whatever is on top of it. Lets have that be a hopper aimed at the side of our furnace.

10207924,0,t1_dc0vnpp,gt As far as the original posts getting almost everything from one mod I dont see the problem. It doesnt matter how many mods it takes to yield X amount of resources it should be a matter of how much work it takes. Doing everything in either of the two mods listed would be a headache worthy of the resources gained.But Im saying it does matter how many mods it takes.  Thats literally the entire point of this post.  It matters because mods and different mechanics in different mods requiring different ways of thinking and planning are fun.  One mod where everything is gathered basically the same way is not fun to me.Im aware you need terrasteel through botania first like  mana pools worth at best but then thats it.  Its over you might as well dump your mana production system because there isnt a big drain on it anymore.   You can dump your auto mana diamondpearlsteel systems and the systems that ensure exactly the right thing is dropped on the amalgamation plate.  All those things are completely unnecessary because a clearly far superior option is there and you already have infrastructure for magical crops so its now just another seed instead of another infrastructure.Im aware some people want that but I think its easy to see why some people wouldnt.All I want to know is if these mods are required for something interesting or if they are really just simpler ways of automating resources you can automate in other ways.,feedthebeast,dc14igf,1,t5_2v620

Since you mentioned Hexxit there is a wealth of magic based content Thaumcraft Botania Blood Magic Witchery Ars Magica Aura Cascade and Chromaticraft.  Most people arent familiar with Chromaticraft I can personally vouch for its epicness.    A bit more specifics about the experience.  This is a hardmode style pack like IEE but with an expanded mod list.  The exploration type content centers around Advent of Ascension but there are other adventure mods like Twilight Forest and Galacticraft.    Many of the IEE recipes are used in this pack but adjusted to accommodate the expanded mod list.  The tech side of the house is centered around GregTech so I know thats a love it or hate it thing.  The mob spawning tables have been hand written along with custom loot tables to make exploring the various dungeons much more profitable for the vast risk.

10417592,0,t1_dcluv13,Raw Sentient Bow will do as well Destructive one just shoots harder. For Destructive one though...You have to plop your gem down into Demon Crucible. It will drain your gem and fill the chunk with its will type.In the same chunk as the Crucible set up a bunch of Crystallizers. They will condense the will from the air and create demonic crystal clusters.Youre going to get cyan will most of the time but theres a slim chance . I think of growing a special Will crystal. What youre looking for when grinding a Destructive is a yellowbrownish variant. Breaking it with a pickaxe will grant you a single crystal of that specific will. You can put it into a crucible but I wouldnt recommend that. A single crystal is worth a fraction of will required to create one so its a very lossy conversion.Combine a crystal with your Gem to get a specific gem of that type. Unfortunately its empty so you will have to kill a bunch of hostiles to get some more of that specific will. Dont try to transfer will between crystals of different types just dont do it trust me. If you set the gem on the Crucible it will fill the air with this specific will type allowing you to grow more crystals of this specific type. If youre going with automation route combining four crystals in a Forge will give you a crystal cluster that you can actually place in the world.Right now youve got two options. Either kill a lot of hostile mobs manually to fill your destructive gem or play around with a ritual called Gathering of the Forsaken Souls to automate your crystal generation. The rituals mechanic is quite confusing but not unbearable  It damages nearby mobs or animals. When a creature dies the ritual attempts to grow a crystal at reduced cost so much reduced in fact that you get more out than you put in. As such you can feed the grown crystals back into the aura via Crucible getting more and more as the ritual kills mobs. Mixing up creatures yields better results. This is where an item routing system provided with the mod really comes in handy. I recommend setting up Gathering of the Forsaken Souls then Crack of the Fractured Crystal one block below they should fit nicely. The crystals grow on top of the Gathering by default so place your crystal clusters on there. Buld Call of the Zephyr to grab the crystals that Crack drops and using a routing system feed those crystals into a Crucible. I like powering my ritual with a chicken coup if you know how to make an automatic egg thrower do itIn order to charge a Tartaric Gem merely put one into a Hellfire Forge. It will automatically drain Will from the aura. Charging a Grand Tartaric Gem to full requires you to have at least  stacks of this types crystal.,feedthebeast,dcowhpb,2,t5_2v620

11170743,0,t1_dexj5ic,Its not entirely true is and is do have a significant bump in base clock as well as a larger cache. Its going to be a much larger difference than RAM frequency even if you go from DDR gt DDR.      His statements on having multiple cores are somewhat misleading as well. the usefulness of having multiple cores. While Minecraft mostly runs on one thread having multiple cores will lessen the impact of your system on the game because it can more effectively distribute its load to the cores that are not being occupied by Minecraft. This might represent an insignificant boost in average FPS but it will reduce the amount and frequency of fps dropsspikes occurring. Slightly less of an issue when you have an i but slightly more so with an i some of which only have  real cores.       In addition having multiple cores allows you to run a local server which effectively means that you can run Minecraft on two threads which will drastically improve average performance and consistency Obviously doesnt matter if you use an external host.        Its true that upgrading from a gt CPU wont net you an improvement that is anywhere near as mindblowing as upgrading your GPU would for your average tripleAAA title but its still vastly more efficient than increasing RAM clock. In most gaming benchmarks dealing with RAM speed the difference cant even be measured and is well within the margin of error.,feedthebeast,dey6wy1,1,t5_2v620

11243885,0,t1_df5durj,Ill tackle this at least the way that I see things. Remember there is no right way to play minecraft. Bit of background info Been playing minecraft since alpha  have played many many packs. Probably my favorite was Infitech   a very grindy Gregtech based pack. I also love mods like Rotarycraft IC Thaumcraft and Botania.Why is grinding and gating good for the gameIf by grinding you mean gathering resources then I would say that is a huge aspect of vanilla minecraft and a core concept to the game in general. The game is called MINEcraft yet in modern survival modpacks there is ohsolittle mining required before you can plop down a magic box to do it all for you. Better yet you can start out very early with ability to mine x very quickly cheaply and essentially bypass all early game progression entirely. Gathering vast amounts of resources is part of the fun of minecraft for many people  the trouble is that many mods namely RFTools TiCon Extra Utilities  Big Reactors and Refined Storage have created situations where is it incredibly easy and cheap to setup HUGE scale mining VERY early in a modpack and completely subvert any grind at all.There are a few mods that handle the grind vs. reward pretty well. I find that Botania continues to be a good example of this. Requires some resources to get off the ground can be automated with some effort provides late game progression. Most of the charm of its progression is lost completely with access to unlimited coal via an automated mining setup and  or  endoflames. Ill continue this line of reasoning but first lets talk about progression. Progression in vanilla context is actually pretty prevalent. Upgrading from WoodStoneIronDiamond tools is significant just as it is with armor. Upgrading those further with enchants later on is somewhat necessary to explore the End and slay the dragon. Then you now have the Elytra  a late game reward that allows flight.Vanilla minecraft has a progression then not super complex or nuanced but its there. It takes time youll need to build a bit of infrastructure develop your toolsarmor and then explore further to gain access to the next tier. Modded  in my opinion read not everyone will agree Im certain  is best when progression is present. I really dislike how inexpensive items like the RFTools Builder are in current versions just as I dislike how cheap the Angel ring continues to be and I dislike Big Reactors by the virtue of how much power they put out and how easy they are to setup and automate and then never worry about again. I feel like mods like these completely subvert other mods and should be late game meaning that you wont have access to them early on in a world.I think most of the better mods currently available offer progression and give you a few way to accomplish it  some of my favorites are Botania IC tried and true AE Ender IO in the absence of unlimited RF multiblocks and there are certainly more but those are the ones that jump out at me for the moment. Botania IC and Ender IO all work just fine as stand alone mods  and are actually decently balanced if you play them without all the silly supporting mods that trivialize any sense of progression.Personally for me  I ask myself  what is the point of playing the game if a couple hours in I can have nighunlimited resources be invincible and able to do whatever I want. Why has it become that Modded Survival has become  psuedocreative mode? If you want these things play creative mode. Dont play Survival and then Pretend that youve accomplished something. It just feels cheaty it doesnt feel like youve earned it it doesnt feel like youve really accomplished anything. You argue that getting certain materials isnt hard but I think youre using extremely OP mods as the metric. Have you tried killing withers without glitching them into a wall in Vanilla MC? It requires preparation time and effort. It is not easy. The same goes for the dragon fight  is it punishingly difficult? No...but without a proper set of equipment and some sound strategy you will certain perish since in vanilla you dont have the ability to fly. But Im sure Withers and the Dragon are not much of a challenge with unlimited creative flight a maxed out TiCon Rapier and a suit of Draconic armor. By using these items youve basically elected to bypass any challenge presented.Ill probably catch a lot of flak for this but I honestly believe the game is far more satisfying to play in survival if there is real risk vs. reward. Many of the mods available currently replicate what used to be lategame utility in a modpack. Essentially I feel like Modded Survival should be an extension of Minecrafts current survival mode but with more advanced items and utility you can gain once youve earned them. Many others feel that Modded Survival should an endless stream of resources that you can attain very early in the game because its modded. Balance and a sense of progression are always going to be important for me as a player. I prefer the Expert mode versions of packs for this reason. I find that climbing a progression ladder is satisfying and I play enough minecraft that I can easily power through nonexpert packs to the very end game in just a few sessions. I like that we now have the option between normal and expert in many packs and I feel like that is a really good way to appease both sets of ideas. Minecraft isnt just about getting tons of resources and building stuff  at least not for me. The path to acquiring resources and power is where all the fun is for me. Starting survival and having no grind and no progression would be like playing Skyrim and being able to get all the best equipment in the first cave. It would be like playing a racing game but youre racing a ferrari against civics. Its a total fiction to call that survival. It would be like playing World of Warcraft and starting at maximum level with the best equipment  why then would you continue to play? Games are about learning growing and getting better. I feel like survival mode should offer this in minecraft. I dont like it when mods in a pack completely subvert it. We have creative mode for this very reason. Why complain about grinding in modded when you can simply cheat stuff in if you dont agree with the recipe?There should be gating to prevent you from reaching endgame too fast if only so you as the player dont cheat yourself of a more satisfying experience. Playing on MP servers where everyone rushes to end game and then disappears isnt fun.P.S Not sure what OP is on about though  Beyond is not difficult or gated by any stretch of the imagination.

I think Extra utilities pipes prioritize closer inventories first so you can pipe out of the hive and have the pipe back into the hive closer than your overflow. Then your overflow can either be a bee chestforget what this is called and farther from that a trash can for final overoverflow. Combs shouldnt go into the bee chest so you can put them in their location of course you can have a chest farther than your centrifuge for overflow and then a trash can for overoverflow.. For extra security you can filter the combs to go one direction and the bees to go another so you dont end up trashing all your beescombs.,feedthebeast,dfeyyaz,2,t5_2v620

11478313,0,t1_dfw2knd,Nice!I too disliked the number of force relays in tree farms but I also struggled with the precision placement required to do farms like this so my standard farm works like thisPros Scales well  can start semiauto move to fully auto and then add endoflamesagricarnationsendflames as needed to increase output. Dont need to worry too much about precision placement of spreaders.   Prealfheim techCons Requires a lot of spreaders given that there is no longer spreadertospreader mana loss you can replace the diluted pools with more spreaders if you have the gold to spare Requires more bore lenses they arent so expensive anymore but still worth mentioning Timing can be a bit funky  top levels dont clear as often as lower levels  but so long as it has enough mana to fire each pulse it tends to work itself out without intervention if you switch to only spreaders that should go away.    Spreader placement isnt funky but placing the rannucarpus and hopperhocks to ensure that wood doesnt get placed and that charcoal gets to endoflames is still somewhat precision.  Its not  blocks in the air so I still prefer it but I wont pretend its effortless.That said Im thrilled to see someone else posting tree farms in text instead of video and that dont require Alfheim tech.  thanks!,feedthebeast,dfx2a20,4,t5_2v620

For example a  tier of log pile will have  layers of loam x at the top x ring x ring and x ring. An actual pyramid should form if done correctly.Light it up with flint and steel and wait I have no idea how long.

11777049,0,t3_67zzd9, Lots of Food is an underused food mod thats much lighterweight than something like the Pams HarvestCraft juggernaut. Even adds candy houses with witches in them! The main downside is that the last time I checked it had basically no integration with other agriculture mods. Exotic Birds. Ever jumped upon hearing a creeper hiss and then realized it was a lyrebird? Now you can. It might be a bit overbearing for some people though. No Nausea is essential for me if Im going to play with Hunger Overhauls nausea effect on low hungerhealth. I set it to cameratilt mode which gives just the right amount of your sight isnt the right way up without causing too much literal nausea in the process. Waila Inhibitors so that you cant see in the dark. Though its slightly annoying that it uses the light level from the player instead of the target block. Make sure to set the hallucination lists for nausea mode to one entry each if you dont like flickering. Village Names makes it possible to actually have some idea which villager was trading the thing you wanted and makes it harder to get stuck in those darn poorlybuilt wells by replacing the sides with slabs you can turn this off.If Im allowed to stretch the question a little then Id also include InGame Info XML in a mode that is not the default. I have a configuration that shows the player their rough height horizontal position and ingame time of day without giving away exact numbers at the slightest provocation and that gives it a really nice feel in terms of simulating ambient senses.
