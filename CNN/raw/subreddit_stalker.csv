Now compound this issue with the same for armors and artefacts and there is a very wide area of useless to masochistic weaponry and armors.Laughably weak man I still remember Pripyats knife hunting... I did not find them weak then DThe Autumn Aurora mod author has recently posted pics of him merging AA with Secret Trails .

The things iron sights were shit so I was having a hard time fighting all of the Monolith troops.I hit the wall  of the NPP and started booking it. I had about  minute left and thats a really long wall if you guys who made it there remember. I ran under  heavy fire popping the soldiers to the left as I could. I could see the door ahead of me but I was just over weight my stam was going fast. I ended up shooting a soldier with my . and in an act of desperation threw my pistol to lose some weight. I made it inside barely. My heart was racing. That was some intense shit.Im that guy who does those shitty Stalker rap songs OG Stalker and Straight Outta Cordon.

I will test this when I get a chance and finally make my way to Lake Yantar again. Will update you then!. Hash will not let me turn in anything to him.. Im getting the feeling that there could be something wrong with your gamedata dir.... The military is somehow not hostile to me anymore despite how many times I kill them.. This could be story related as you do have to converse with military quite a bit. However this could also be a messed up relation system.. Somehow all of my contacts have changed to military personnel. This could be related to the area that you are currently in? Many bugs have been found in the PDA section. So there is a potential that this has already been fixed. However if I do find this bug. I will report it.. Bloodsuckers just run around and dont attack me.. This is peculiar indeed. Ill keep my eyes peeled for this.. Clicking on the Downloads section of my PDA will Crash to Desktop. sometimes with other buttons as well. Yes well aware of this issue. It looks like it has been sorted out. Ill keep my eyes on the PDA though.. Rats Mice and other small animals have no cooldown between attacks a single rat hits constantly with no chance for escape.. I have never experienced this with the rats or rodents. Okay once again it sounds like something could be messed up in your gamedata dir. Try a reinstall. If this does not fix it then please inform me. Ill investigate this in the mean time.Thanks for your input!,stalker,ciaj6er,4,t5_2r74m

All it shows is old stalker stuff b the domain was registered by some random dude in Vegas and c not only do half the people on the company list not actually exist but half are stock photos and the ones that arent? Have said they arent part of it. Add to that the fact that k is nowhere near enough to make a game like what theyre promising and also that they said once we hit k well hire more artists to make the vegetation better  which is not something that needs either more people for or more money for. Its one of the easiest things to do. The whole thing is shoddy badly put together and in general just sets off all sorts of alarm bells in my head and in others. I really really want another stalker like game. If these guys turn out to be legit I will eat all the hats I own and a few pairs of socks too for good measure.

Loners fighting bandits faction patrols animal attacks random campfires. Even the remains of conflict maybe findings a dead stalker with a few dead dogs around him. The knowledge that things happen without my causing them. Upgrading and maintaining my weapon felt cool. In game of thrones the weapons of the characters have personalities they have names and histories. There is something special in stalker about finding a sweet gun repairing it upgrading it getting attachments and getting to know it. I think a good stalker table top would have a weapon maintenance and upgrade system. Chilling out by the fire with stalkers waiting for the night to pass. Very atmospheric. If you could brainstorm personalities of loners the players could meet and interact with it would add to the immersion. ,stalker,cipvjnm,2,t5_2r74m

1648476,0,t3_2d7szr,Im not quite sure if youre only talking about DutyFreedom or every faction in the game.Concerning DutyFreedom the choice is about your idea of what the Zone is. If the Zone is a threat that can only be eliminated by disciplined and motivated soldiers then Duty is for you  btw they have a use for artifacts they systematicaly hand them over to ecologists for research purposes .If on the other hand you believe that the Zone is a gift to mankind and an unique opportunity for technological progress and that it should be accessible to all who seek their fortune then Freedom is where you belong.When it comes to the attitude fo the factions its more of a personal choice. I find Freedom to be annoying hippies Freedom think Duty are butthurts fascists...That being said if you know the story of the Zone  How it was created and what it truly is  turns out that Duty is right about the Zone being a danger. Thats what motivated my choice. Freedom sure are nicer to hang out with and constant discipline can be exhausting....but theyre just wrong.

You will on average see many enemies flinch from bullets and do their damage animations but will seem like they do this three or four times before dying making it feel very artificialuncanny.The complete mod will try to make guns less scaled and more like actual guns no artificial weakness early on. Bullet sponge is slightly better but still around the same ballpark.

2785356,0,t3_2rynea,Most of your ideas are pretty cool but like you said theyre extremely ambitious. Only a major studio backed by a powerful publisher could afford such a game.However in my opinion randomizing labs is a poor idea. Every ennemy needs to be in a defined position to achieve maximum effect. A snork jumpin at you from a corner is very scary. A snork spawning at the end of a corridor so you have  minuts to shoot him not so much. It could also lead to pretty ridiculous situations like having  burers tearing you apart at the start of the lab then almost nothing for the rest of the exploration.Also I think that having a rank system is a poor idea. First because no matter how good your AI is followers will always saydo something stupid and completely irrelevant which kind of break the immersion. Second because STALKER is about being alone against the Zone thats why the L in STALKER stands for Loners. Third because its much harded to balance a game if the player can have an army at his command. And finally but this is just a personal point I greatly enjoy the fact that your skill and equipment are what determines the difficulty. If I have trouble dealing with a mission I can either improve myself or come back with a grenade launcher. Its more satisfying than calling a squad for me to hide behind.,stalker,cnkoo4f,2,t5_2r74m

Most games increase difficulty by drawing out encounters so the chance of your making a mistake stays the same but you have more opportunity to make enough mistakes that you get killed.

3322424,0,t3_2y7ifi,First playthrough? I personally dont recommend you running Autumn Aurora first time. AA is hardish. I would recco Zone Reclamation Project for your first time since its just bugfixes or maybe Complete for a bit more easier time but... here you are.Sounds like youre in the Garbage at the car lot where Bes is. That part can be tough early on especially with the crappy starting gear. You uh probably arent going to find any better armor any time soon but you should have been able to pick up a PP Bizon which uses x Makarov rounds in AA x is a different caliber familiar in America as just mm. Dont get em confused if you still have the starting pistol Makarov then it uses x from a dead bandit by now. Bizon is actually fairly decent in early play. On my current game I got lucky and the Military guys under the railroad trestle were mostly killed by bandits and I could mop up and so had a AK by the time I got to where you are then I got an awesome random stash drop that led me to the Dark Valley to get a special suit added to the game by AA. But you cant just go get that you have to get a random stash from a dead NPC... This is my first time playing AA and Ive found there to be no good armor options early on. Play smart try not to get shot. DUh so what else..? With a Bizon I find I can sorta hole up in that parking lot attendants kiosk there on the east side of that lot by the road and the gate and fire on the bandits as they come over the ridge from the west. Try not to let them get down amongst the vehicles though. It only gets harder when they have that to use for cover. Try to use some of those random NPCs as a bit of a buffer between you and the bandits... If youre all the way at the back the bandits will usually engage with the Loner NPCs and you can take pot shots at guys who are aiming at people other than yourself.Finally I know it seems counter intuitive but consider putting the diff back up to Master. For my final advice I will quote a fellow stalker on the Steam forumsgt The difficulty works both ways guns deal more damage both to you and enemies. Aim for the head and upper body. Always aim down sights. Crouch to improve accuracy. Fire in short bursts or singleshot automatic fire is hard to use from long range. Most importantly use cover no cover and youre good as dead.Good luck stalker.,stalker,cp6zgh7,6,t5_2r74m

3474421,0,t1_cpo8ej7,Well it may or not be more realistic I dont know. My changes were both to balance early game but also there were serious problems with weapon accuracy in vanilla stalker. Pistols especially the early pistols are comically inaccurate. The early rifles are also similarly useless at everything except point blank range.The pistols are all more realistic IMO since I actually went in game and tested at musing the in game distance and you could now empty a mag and get a torsosized grouping maybe head sized if you paused between shots which is roughly realistic. I think I tested this with the basic mm pistol. The PM is a little less accurate most other pistols a little more.I personally like really twitchy instadeath shooters and mechanicallyspeaking one of my favorite FPS games was the original Operation Flashpoint. Id love to get STALKER to feel like that but there are a few issues. The biggest is that I havent played OF in years but also OF allowed engagement at m. STALKER combat almost entirely takes place in m or less. A final issue is that I dont have much real life experience with firearms! Ive only shot rifles once and pistols a few times.Anyway Id love to move it in a more realistic direction.,stalker,cpob5fw,3,t5_2r74m
3485116,0,t1_cppimjn,You should be able to do it regardless of the ENB. Honestly the mod author of AA took someone elses ENB because they thought it looked nice but I dont think they understand how the ENB works. For example instead of leaving the modified r shaders from earlier versions of AA they just removed them altogether as far as Ive heard.At the title screen no level is loaded so you shouldnt have a problem changing the resolution there. You can also shiftf to toggle on and off the shader. shiftenter opens some basic ENB settings I think.The ENB may not be compatible with any renderer other than full dynamic but I dont know for sure.You can also check out the user.cfg and change the resolution there too.

3618126,0,t1_cq407tl,gtI dont want a harder game quicksaving all the time and deaths are a huge immersion breaker. I dont even play on master difficulty. I dont know if the same thing works in CoP but isnt master difficulty actually easier? I know for a fact that its the easiest difficulty in SoC.The way difficulty is handled is both bullet damage but also bullet accuracy. In various difficulties some bullets never actually have collision and never deal damage. In master they always deal damage if they actually hit something or somebody.This makes it easier in most scenarios because on master you can reliably take people out with headshots you can survive nearsuicidal behavior leaning around a corner and spraying is more effective when the bullets actually deal damage etc.,stalker,cq4oxsp,1,t5_2r74m

4141703,0,t1_crs0ufu,Ive just played through the first two for the first time back to back and am maybe halfway through CoP.Yes CoP is far far more polished than SoC but theres nothing particularly outdated about SoC. Its certainly buggy and if you play the later games first you will probably miss some of the mechanics but taken by itself the game does not seem to obviously need those features. It does have two major design defects that are not bugs  the first is that stealth is more or less impossible in most situations the second is that terrible clipping through structures means you can often be hit through what should be covered.Anyway the obvious reason not to start with CoP is that its the first game in a trilogy so you wont get the backstory in the intended order. Seems like an obvious enough objection. You may have been reading too much into the other post.Regarding difficulty at this point I think CoP has the hardest combat but the combat is so rare very surprising design choice to make bandits neutral that the overall feel of the game is that its the easiest in my opinion. Enemy accuracy seems like the highest in the series and whether due to AI or map design I havent yet had the opportunity to exploit AIs limit search radius.CoP does shower you with money and loot which is unfortunate because the game seems to be the most geared toward survival and scavenging.,stalker,crsde2v,1,t5_2r74m

5132527,0,t3_3la2pb,SOC will always have a special place in my heart and when people say STALKER I will always think of that game first. But CoP does have a few distinct advantages. Its far less buggy for one. The map design does leave something to be desired but its less linear than SoC and in some ways the world does feel bigger. You can actually get lost in Zaton for example if you arent paying attention. I never found myself lost in SoC because in most maps you are only  seconds of sprinting from the nearest level changer.CoP also refined the weapon repairupgrade system from CS in a way that makes it way more fun. I did think the CoP maps were designed a little lazily though. The space between the landmarks seems to be almost autogenerated... so much of the Zaton map is boring boring boring.To me is CoP better? Well maybe in some ways. I cant say which one I like more because all the STALKER games have their merits... even Clear Sky which I found to be incredibly fun after I patched it.Ive been playing CoP MISERY and loving it.

Autumn Edition . is what Im going to focus on I like all the refinements they did in ...Ive really grown to appreciate the work of the AA guys in doing this merge. They are incredibly detailed and planned everything carefully. For instance they added .xmm NATO ammo to balance the .xmm Russian already in the game.  So theres now powerful NATO rifles in the end game the FN FAL is brutal along with a NATO sniper rifle. Lots of balancing touches and detail like that. .. does similar stuff. For eg it tightens the economy not just in pricing but in which trader handles what. Sakharov the Ecologist will only sell you a basic pistol and xmm ammo so youd best go there with lots of rifle ammo. The Duty and Freedom traders only do Russian and NATO weapons each respectively now. The exception was the Freedom trader having a Russian sniper because there was no NATO sniper in the game. I fixed that with the AA merge.Two of my favorite mods if that isnt clear. ,stalker,cv5fj4l,2,t5_2r74m

One interresting elements is that the seen recoil is stronger than the felt recoil so even if you have seemingly a hard time aiming due to strong kicks from individual rounds you still hit pretty okay.

Generators is such a gnarly map that its a pity to have it as empty as it is in vanilla CoC.

I remember them completely slamming XRay in one of the interviewsgtDigital Foundry Youve previously worked on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. noted for its own tech. So what exactly is the relationship between the A engine and your previous work in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.?gtOles Shishkovstov Theres no relationship. Back when I was working as lead programmer and technology architect on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it became apparent that many architectural decisions were great for the time when it was designed but they just dont scale to the present day.gtThe major obstacles to the future of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. engine were its inherent inability to be multithreaded the weak and errorprone networking model and simply awful resource and memory management which prohibited any kind of streaming or simply keeping the working set small enough for nextgen consoles.gtAnother thing which really worried me was the textbased scripting. Working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it became clear that designersscriptwriters want more and more control and when they got it they were lost and needed to think like programmers but they werent programmers! That contributed a lot to the original delays with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.gtSo I started a personal project to establish the future architecture and to explore the possibilities of the design. The project evolved quite well and although it wasnt functional as a game  not even as a demo it didnt have any rendering engine back then  it provided me with clear vision on what to do next.gtWhen A started as an independent studio this work became a foundation of the future engine. Because of the tight timescale weve opted to use a lot of middleware to get things going quickly. Weve selected PhysX for physics PathEngine for AI navigation LUA as a primary development file format not a scripting engine for easy SVN merging RakNet for physical network layer FaceFX for facial animation OGG Vorbis for sound format and many other small things like compression libraries etc.gtThe rendering was hooked up in about three weeks  its easy to do when you work with deferred shading  although it was far from being optimal or featurerich.gtDigital Foundry So to be clear theres no shared code whatsoever between the A and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. XRay engines?gtOles Shishkovstov When the philosophies of the engines are so radically different it is nearly impossible to share the code. For example we dont use basic things such as C standard template library and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has every second line of code calling some type of STL method. Even the gameplay code in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was mostly using an updatepoll model while we use a more signalbased model.gtSo the final answer is no we do not have shared code with XRay nor would it be possible to do so.gtDigital Foundry But if you had just done a straight port of the XRay engine how would it have worked out on PS and ?gtOles Shishkovstov That would be extremely difficult. A straight port will not fit into memory even without all the textures all the sounds and all the geometry. And then it will work at around one to three frames per second. But that doesnt matter because without textures and geometry you cannot see those frames! Thats my personal opinion but it would probably be wise for GSC to wait for another generation of consoles.,stalker,cxkehfy,2,t5_2r74m

6046077,0,t3_3ybupa,ZRP is the way to go first time. Its a sort of community bugfix that doesnt change the core gameplay only fixes glitches bugs and oversights left in the vanilla game. Its the standard firsttime recommendation of rstalker SoC  ZRP. You can also throw in Absolute Nature and Absolute Structures to update the graphics a bit but those are entirely optional and left to your personal preferences.We dont like to recommend for new players to use mods that alter the core gameplay because since its your first time you wont know what is a standard feature and what is a new feature brought in by the mod and it can lead to a lot of confusion. OGSE makes changes to the fundamental core gameplay enough that it would be better to save that for a later playthrough. Playing with ZRP allows you to get the best possible taste of the original game. ,stalker,cyc5am7,6,t5_2r74m

6127537,0,t3_3zepdc,I cant prove it but I think I speak for all of us who have played CoP in several difficulties that in CoP the enemies just die easier in higher difficulties and you also take more damage. With easier difficulties pistols are completely useless guns but when playing with the highest difficulty pistols are very effective. I use Colt  a lot and it kill with two shots to chest even at long ranges. I dont know if range affects damage though.So I have no proof but its crystal clear that its easier to kill enemies with higher difficulties. The trade off is that you also die VERY easily. One good hit from shotgun and you are done one bullet from AK and my health goes down to about  with Sunrise suit upgraded to tier .,stalker,cym4ycg,1,t5_2r74m

Cheeki breeki sound file is detour.ogg so it was meant as expression for bandits who are flanking you. And thats exactly where they use it! So Youre unlikely to hear it in narrow corridors of agro underground no room to flank or when passing by bandit camps  assaulting them yourself.  You hear it often if bandits are attacking position and you are defending it. There are  versions of it.. My favorite is is from ...humanbanditfightdetour... folder.

6748041,0,t1_d0h5gf4,I am kinda stuck at the moment and think it would be wise to just move on.To give context I am playing the Misery mod for CoP. Now I need to move to the last map and to do that I have to go through Jupiters administrative buildings buuuuut I still have to check the last crash site in Jupiter itself.Now I fought chimeras before. I fought izloms and burers as well as zombies. After the whole moment where I emerged victorious from  controllers a pack of dogs izloms zombies and bloodsuckers I never thought I would be going against odds as silly as that again. And it turns out I was really REALLY wrong. Jupiter plant had quite the surprise waiting for me. First time I went there I had to fight  chimeras at the same time and I somehow managed to kill them. Bear in mind this is Master difficulty the hardest there is. And so because I basically ran out of ammo for both my rifle and shotgun fighting these beasts I went back to Yanov to gear up and try again.And here I am on my second time around and I just killed  burers that came after me all at once not to mention a zombie patrol never underestimate zombies. Now I need to fight  more chimeras. I have used a lot of grenades trying to get rid of the burers and clearing out zombie patrols and wasted quite a bit of ammo on the burers themselves.I swear the Zone wants me dead. Either that or it wants me to succeed and I will be damned if I give up now. ,stalker,d0hayd1,2,t5_2r74m

Armors with heavy protections hardly have any artifact slots which are immensely useful and armors with heavy anomaly protections dont have enough stopping power to negate bullet damage.My favorite armor is CS which is also a in some localizations. It does a decent job at protecting the player from anomalies and bullets alike I prefer chosing the armor upgrade tree. The base suit only costs k RU and can be purchased in the first location of the game. Another suit thats good at all stats is the SEVA but it loses in bulletproof cap by  points its  as good as CS but wins in anomaly protection by x in any upgrade tree anomaly protection tree grants  damage negation from anomalies awesome!.However a heavy drawback is that you can only fully upgrade the suit by bringing the bandit mechanic flash drives. This means you have to stay neutral with bandits and run around collecting flash drives which is time consuming and expensive.,stalker,d20m4cq,1,t5_2r74m

But is it really that terrible? I for one cant say Ive ever played a game that had such distinct dynamic lighting as what Ive seen in Xray. For that alone I wouldnt even consider switching engines unless I could do as good or better.Everyone always talks about Cryengine as being some holy grail. Ive never played a cryengine game that didnt feel consoley in terms of lighting and player movement. Could be because Ive largely fallen out of gaming and have missed some great releases. Yes cry engine has some amazing potential with shaders. Weve all seen nearphotorealistic graphical adjustments for Crysis. But IMO that doesnt make an automatic great fit for stalker. Id even take the player movement in stalker over that of crysis by a large margin.

I would suggest this if you dont want to play purevanilla Im not sure how much it changes because I havent played this myself. CoP is generally not advised. Its dated and a lot say it makes the game a lot simpler havent played dont know. SGM is like Misery changes a lot but I definetly advise to play it atleast once. I myself am on . Geonezis run right now.  hours in I just got to the first  helis in Zaton  And no I didnt slack off that you just need to progress quite a lot and theres so much stuff to do... But I am running around with a monolith exoskeleton maxing at kg of weight to carry kg if Im with combat artifacts which lessen the chances of me getting hit and adding extra armor oneshotonekill sniper norecoildeadlyaccuratehighdamage XM and a powerful shotgun... you may think thats op but I still die very often NPCs can HS you and its instakill for you and I havent reached pripyat yet... oh well... back to the game  But to note that SGM . is in the makings .  Geo has a lot of unpolished stuff  its a translation so there are some hard things to understand and a lot of inconsistencies in the game weapon damage varies a lot etc LA does  the damage of LA while they use the same ammo in game. But its still playable and fun if youre not that concerned with uberrealism etc etc Russian modders dont care about the details they look at the bigger picture This is also the reason why a lot of great mods in english community die we focus too much on the details and cant eventually finish what we started Misery is worth your time but dont do it st playthrough and dont play rookie  Cause you aint no rookie if youre in the zone ,stalker,d9z7sdq,3,t5_2r74m
