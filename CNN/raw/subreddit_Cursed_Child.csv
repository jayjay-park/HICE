The problem most people have VoldemortBellatrix it is they assume she was a child of romance or passion.Voldemort was obsessed with imposing his power over others. If Harry Potter was as graphic as Game of Thrones Voldemort would be a rapist. There are probably several children of Voldemort Delphi just happened to be raised in a family that zealously worshipped him and was privy to more of his magical knowledge.What I dont like about the story is why Voldemort had to be used as a threat at all. Delphi would have been an amazing villain on her own.  ,Cursed_Child,d60f3kt,6,t5_3e9qi

A perfect summing up of how little details they shared about that....were supposed to believe that in three short years a boy whos house is known for loyalty and fairness becomes a cold blooded killer because he got embarrassed once? ,Cursed_Child,d65fnmw,39,t5_3e9qi
8520755,0,t1_d66c2uw,My wife was crushed. Shes been a potter fan since the beginning. I joined late largely because of her. She works at a library got to put the cover on got to read it first. It was such a big deal. She read it all in a sitting. I thought it must be going pretty well. Then shes like well that was shit. Starts telling me about it and Im just in shock. Think shes overexaggerating because no sane person would make these decisions. Shes not. Poor girl it really crushed her. ,Cursed_Child,d66nlkz,2,t5_3e9qi
8541697,0,t1_d65gof5,Totally agree. Time travel has been done to death and it seemed to me more like a pass for the play to delve into fan service than the genuinely best idea they could have come up with. These are smart people  they could have done better I think.,Cursed_Child,d69a4mm,3,t5_3e9qi
8552928,0,t1_d6am5wx,Okay. Its official. This book doesnt exist in canon.Regardless of what Jo says.,Cursed_Child,d6aou3d,10,t5_3e9qi
8559499,0,t3_4wuix1,Did anyone else think that Ron giving Albus a love potion completely ridiculous?Thats how Voldemort was created!Also Bellatrix was pregnant and no one knew? Would have been cool if it was hinted or if she used the timeturner to go back but otherwise outta left field.,Cursed_Child,d6biix5,31,t5_3e9qi
8582276,0,t3_4x6rur,Basically the plot sucks so if you read it only it sucks.The play is good even though the plot sucks so seeing the play is a good thing.,Cursed_Child,d6edc0c,6,t5_3e9qi
