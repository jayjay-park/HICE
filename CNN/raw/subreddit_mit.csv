7833,0,t3_1u786u,Course  junior here. Do NOT do this if you are only thinking about engineering. It is graded on an absolute scale and is geared very specifically towards course  so if you do not have a specific interest in aeroastro do not risk the potential destruction of your gpa. Coming from the spring  unified class no one got As in it or AA as we have it graded due to the registering for both . and .. The highest grade was an AB and these were the first Bs of some of these students lives and they make MIT look easy aside from Unified they are seriously the geniuses that argue with the professor and WIN the argument and they still do NOT get the AA grade.It is this scary which is why course  expects you to complete it and carry on. My advice is figure out what you want to do and if course  is what you want you will take unified. If it isnt do NOT take it for funsies. This will sound dickish but I am assuming you are not a genius hence will not get the AA unless you work your ass off on the class like  hours a day of work and studying PLUS required labwork ... which is a lot. Unified did get a revamping this year but some of my sophomore friends that had a . gpa ... well they had it ... enough said. Also the lab revamping has harder labs this year and they take up easily  hours each and you dont get a break from PSETs ever ... Even over Thanksgiving break no break.If you want course  welcome! If not dont take unified. You can go through course  and get some good intro classes there that are more manageablereasonably graded seriouslymore pertinent to general applications. Just remember course  is all geared towards the aerospace industry applications. This starts in unified. The class unifies all of the main subjects of mechanical systems  materials structure thermodynamics fluid dynamics and systems and signals  and shows how they apply specifically to airplanes rockets satellites etc.Also you cant take it as a freshman unless you ASEpass out of . . . and .. If you did that good for you but you wont have a fun PNR semester trust me... The amount of psets and lab time will demolish your social life because your friends will be in course  where the pset groups are.,mit,cefbtmi,6,t5_2qh3w

1360582,0,t3_29nspm,Professor Teller was an amazing lecturer a brilliant roboticist and a good man.  I took a robotics class with him and he made the grueling course an absolute joy.  He was kind supportive deeply invested in his students and truly cared not just about his research but about teaching.  Praise from him was worth the world and he always took the time to give personalized feedback to every single student in a decently large class.  He will be missed not just by friends family colleagues and students but by all the people his research has touched.  He has worked on vision systems for the blind voicecontrolled wheelchairs for people with limited mobility autonomous vehicles and so much more.Rest in peace Professor.,mit,cimu7ff,11,t5_2qh3w

7723588,0,t3_4kiqx4,I agree with EccentricWyvern and disagree with eitanglinert strongly. Failing a class will look very poorly but there are situations where it can be excused. Think about what caused you to fail the class and if you can show that it was due to some oneoff reason and demonstrate that you grew and improved from then on it could even look like a positive. I think this is definitely something you need to explain in your application.Remember that college apps are generally read holistically and the readers are people as well. ,mit,d3k4ad7,2,t5_2qh3w

You dont have to pile up an insane workload like this to be successful at MIT.

9729863,0,t3_5ec9ng,You seem set on doing this even though its a bad idea.There doesnt appear to be anything in MIT policy that  governs this. You send the scores to MIT from the college board and it seems like it doesnt matter when you take them. I suspect that the real problem will be either with the college board not wanting to administer the test to you since youre not a high school student or individual high schools which I guess are the only testing sites not wanting some random to come in to take a test.Anyway like I said above taking a gap year is a terrible idea if youre only doing it to place out of classes. The MIT equivalents will be vastly better than what you can teach yourself. If you really want to  try this just take the advanced standing exams at MIT when you get there. ,mit,dacf2fv,2,t5_2qh3w

In all of the classes that I have instructedTAed for there is some wiggle room with the placing of the grade divisions based on the students themselves. For example if some calculation would put  as the AB cutoff the staff might look at the . students effort and decide to push the cutoff to . so that a student whos really put in the work is rewarded.
