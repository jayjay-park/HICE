I inquired as to whether or not FFXIV was actually regionlocked as there was no mention of this on the email or mobile site. Now I know they cant give me what they sold me I can request a refund. Thank you for sharing the message!Not impressed by Humbles poor regionlock information or slow support on this issue. Hopefully they can improve in future.,humblebundles,cyou574,1,t5_2xbzi

8516205,0,t1_d65xrb1,Thats great that you like the bundle.  My suggestion for what its worth to you is that you base the value of the games on what you would actually pay for them right now.  Van Helsing looks interesting to you so my guess is that you value it at some nonzero dollar amount but I doubt its worth . to you  otherwise you would have bought it yesterday.  For example if it looks interesting you might value it at  meaning youd probably pick it up on a Steam sale.  Add up the values of the games using dollar amounts you would have been willing to pay right now knowing what the games are.  If it beats  which it typically does for me but not this month or last month then youre in good shape.  Basically I think in this case we need to distinguish between cost and value.   off a box of tampons is objectively a great deal.  However Im not interested in tampons so I wouldnt take the deal because they dont provide value to me.  Van Helsing to me is like a box of tampons.,humblebundles,d6632jj,1,t5_2xbzi
