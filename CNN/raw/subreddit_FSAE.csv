161519,0,t1_cequo0c,I have only ever attended FSAEA not sure if all the statics are judged the same for the US comps but my  centsDesign ReportThe rules book is quite clear on the layout of the design report how many pages of text  drawings etc follow them . No need to include a title page etc just a nice heading with team name car number etc. Break the  pages of text down logically start with a team philosophy goals and targets for the car then move into more detail. We have submitted reports broken down by subsystem control electronics powertrain... etc and by goals light weight simple etc and both seemed well accepted. The most important thing Ive found is to do really awesome drawings. We do them all in solidworks then export them as vectors into adobe illustrator to clean them up and add text etc. We did a lot of cutouts and detail views to give them as much information as possible. Make sure the drawings are vectors in you .pdf submission that way they can be zoomed in infinitely to see the detail stuff.Link to a bad screenshot of one of our drawings from  design report Cost pages is nothing for a good cost report  I submitted close to  to FSAEA  by the time we had detail drawings for every part and exploded views for each assembly. Yes it was a shit tonne of work only so many solidworks drawings one person can do. Only trick to this event is be meticulous with every single part submitting and addendum despite the penalty is a really good idea especially for all the last minute bits required to meet scruit got pulled by the judges and lost a few points on that one.BusinessDid the business presentation  years in a row because no one wanted to and  years in a row is was a terrible last minute literally last minute powerpoint clusterfuck. Last year we recruited some business faculty students and they did really well  their degree is that event let it be there problem.,FSAE,cewtvzb,1,t5_2sf3r

2263724,0,t3_2l2vj0,Be aware that a lot of engine models you will find on the internet like what you find on grabcad and the like will likely have problems and differences to the actual engine. I think they are made mostly to do renders with and so being close is good enough but doing precision CAD work with them will only cause you problems down the road.If you have the engine block already that you plan to use draw out in CAD the important points you need by measuring the block. The  years for Yamaha get confusing as they released a new version of the R in  and the older R became the RS. The engine blocks are very different. We learned the hard way and have an extra engine we have nothing to do with.If you can get access to a CMM you can make a fairly detailed model depending on how long you want to spend on it.,FSAE,clrilig,2,t5_2sf3r

5728025,0,t3_3thunu,I dont work in fsae anymore but use it for work and i really like it. Big assemblies are not problem but you obviously need the hardware to support it. I would suggest an i gb ram and a good graphics card nvidia quaddro if you can. Then it can handle complex parts regen time and huge assemblies. So a full car model should be ok. Keep with creo  for now though.,FSAE,cx748ic,1,t5_2sf3r

6650777,0,t1_d06slkr,This is a great list. I think Engineer to Win is probably the best starting point personally.I would also add Katzs Race Car Aerodynamics. Its a very good primer on aerodynamics and keeps to the theory much more than the pure math so its easy to grasp and doesnt require much of an engineering background. ,FSAE,d078xio,3,t5_2sf3r

7178451,0,t3_4d30un,The group dynamic thing sounds silly. Your team should be united over the need to design and build the best thing possible not whether youre friends or not. We thin out the big crowds at the beginning of the year with a short video that was made about our team. In it one of our more recent and distinguished alum talks about what it takes to be relevant in fsae. Its not the usual complainbrag you hear from fsae members but a pretty good acknowledgement of the stress and dedication and lack of sleep and friends and etc. that thins out the herd.The ones that end up staying show up to the general weekly meetings that we hold pretty much only as info sessions. We do actual team stuff but nothing we couldnt cover at the engineering meetings. Everyone is invited to the engineering meetings but theyre on Friday evenings and its when we get pretty technical. We ask simply that you dont interrupt while we conduct business most people quietly wait to leave and never come back. If theyre genuinely interested then by this point theyve gotten a glimpse of what we do. The system leads have a task list that was compiled over the summer to dole out to these new people. Some of it is making tabs some of it is simple design work its all beneficial to the prospect and the team so long as standards are upheld. After a month or so people organically work their way into larger projects into working with a system lead. Nothing fancy yet though. Then they get their own projects. Design and build a testing rig or some other important thing thats not going on the car. If they do this well then they get machine shop training or composites manufacturing training. If this goes well then they make parts for the car. If this goes well the following year they can design and work right under a design lead. Overall we allow anybody in. We have people that are around for  year but dont ever end up doing anything. We dont bully them out or push them into roles. Only when they show initiative do we nudge them along. Out of a starting crowd of several hundred we keep about  by the end of the academic year but theyll make up the core of future teams. And all the work that was done by people who eventually drop out really adds up. Its a load off of leads and other more skilled members. ,FSAE,d1u4igj,2,t5_2sf3r
7333743,0,t1_d2bh9nq,We have massive facilities but we also have a lot of student teams competing for manpower and resources. There are also a ton of students involved in research in some capacity so there isnt a lot of free time for Fsae. We have  people who do design help with design. But fsae isnt the biggest kid on the block competing for peoples time. We have a British study abroad kid on our team this year and he pointed out that college sports are not really a a thing in Europe and drew the comparison between Fsae in Europe and college sports in America. Here the school basically shuts down on football Saturdays. ,FSAE,d2bso9e,2,t5_2sf3r
