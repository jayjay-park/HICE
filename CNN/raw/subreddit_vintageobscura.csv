10235783,0,t1_dc48hxt,BTW The little band scene was an experimental postpunk scene which flourished in Melbourne Australia from  until early . Instigated by local group Primitive Calculators this scene was concentrated in the inner suburbs of Fitzroy and St Kilda and was characterised by large numbers of shortlived bands more concerned with artistic expression than mainstream success. The bands played in small innercity venues often pubs and their music was recorded live and broadcast by Alan Bamford on community radio station RRR. In the scene the distinctions between performers and audience were blurred many audience members were either in little bands or ended up forming such.The scene was dramatised in the  cult film Dogs in Space.One of the bands includes The Jetsonnes which included members that went on to form Hunters amp Collectors Mark Seymour John Archer and Doug FalconerThe Jetsonnes  Newspaper  Mark Seymour guitar John Archer bass Doug Falconer drums Ray TostiGueira guitar Margot ONeill vocals,vintageobscura,dc4a7cp,3,t5_2tgzu
10345817,0,t3_5o5ozt,Lojos Ills keyboards vocals Jnos Brdy vocals guitar flute  Levente Szrnyi guitar vocals  Szabolcs Szrnyi bass vocals  Zoltn Psztory drums One of the most crucial rockpop groups of Hungary. Due to their local impact they were sometimes dubbed The Hungarian Beatles. The band started in  as a family music band. After many member changes and also musical changes the final line up was formed in  and they started to write their own songs. After many  singles and coproductions their first LP Nehz az t was released in . They combined Hungarian folk music elements with the then latest trends in Western poprock for their unique sound. They maintained their success through several albums and toured Western Europe and the UK  a rare privilege for bands from behind the iron curtain  before disbanding in In  the New Economic Mechanism was introduced intending on revitalizing the Hungarian economy. The New Economic Mechanism was a major economic reform launched in the Peoples Republic of Hungary which eased foreign trade restrictions gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector.With elements of free market economics as well as an improved human rights record it represented a quiet reform and deviation from the Soviet principles applied to Hungary in the previous decade.It was often referred to as Goulash Communism Hungarian gulyskommunizmus derived from goulash a popular Hungarian dish made with an assortment of disparate ingredients. The New Economic Mechanism reflected how Hungarian communism was a mixed ideology and how it no longer strictly adhered to MarxistLeninist interpretations as in the past.Hungary in this particular period enjoyed many amenities not available in the rest of the Eastern Bloc and evidently making great psychedelic records was one of them.According to one Hungarian music blog Ills became the Hungarian Beatles with song writers SzrnyiBrdy considered the Eastern Bloc LennonMcCartney. In the same blog it states Illss first LP Nehz az t Difficult Road  is one of the most important Hungarian records of its era. The blog translates the songs titles and some of the lyrics  Szerelem Love is a psychedelic folk song about love  Ill never leave you  Just call me. However the blog also states that there are plenty of protest songs.Evidently too much protest as in the s the Russians cracked down on dissidents in Hungary and rock music was a major target. Ills were banned from performing and recording any songs that were deemed subversive. All Hungarian rock bands in the s had to conform to the record companys demands and ensure that all songs passed the inspection of the Song Committee who scrutinized all songs looking for ideological disobedience.Ills  Nehz az t Full Album Her Majestys Satanic Psychedelicatessen Pt.

11015134,0,t3_5xamad,Dave Zerfas drums percussion vocals Herman Zerfas keyboards vocals Mark Tribby bass guitars vocals Steve Newbold bass guitarsThe littleknown Indianapolis band Zerfas put out one selfreleased album in  that in the manner of many such records of the era with limited distribution sounded a few years behind the times in its emulation of the late psychedelic epoch. By the standards of such private pressings however it was considerably above average. At its best the reasonably strong original material had echoes of both the lateperiod Beatles and Beatlesinfluenced bands like Badfinger and the Move. They were a little more idiosyncratic than many of those kinds of bands though employing some backwards tapes hazy unsteady timbres and a grand organ sound owing something to early British progressive rock. Some of the lesser songs werent so hot but the production vocal harmonies and relatively concise execution displayed more thought and care than the usual smallpress ventures.Zerfas ST Full Album   You Never Win   The Sweetest Part   I Dont Understand   I Need It Higher   Stoney Wellitz   Hope   Fools ParadeThe Piper  Zerfas only and very obscure album is uneven but fairly worthy justpostpsychedelia and actually one of the better and certainly least heralded attempts to tap into a lates Beatles sort of vibe albeit one that has a sadder tinge than the original article. As with all such efforts be aware right away that this is a stylistic and not a qualitative comparison its not nearly on the level of the White Album and actually not all of the cuts are heavily Beatlesinfluenced. As it happens however the songs where the Beatlesish vocal harmonies and guitar textures are emphasized are the best ones like The Sweetest Part which is a little like George Harrisons All Things Must PassmeetsBadfinger. Maybe you can add a little of the most Beatlesque Move into the equation for I Dont Understand though that cut has a delicious artificialsounding fluttery wobble to the instrumentation and cathedral organ that arent explicitly imitative of anyone. Weird backwards and spaceshipemulative effects are sprinkled throughout the album and not always to a good end the forced demonic joviality of the opening You Never Win is a rather misleading opener for instance that might turn off some listeners wholl quite like some of the rest of it. On the whole there are some quite respectable fusions of late American psychedelia with latesearlys British psychprog with decent knacks for pleasing melodies good vocal harmonies and focused arrangements with a touch of odd spaciness.Further reading ,vintageobscura,degj92u,1,t5_2tgzu
