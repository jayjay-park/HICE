4733102,0,t3_3fqhiw,Electric Skateboards have been around for a while but I think  is going to be the year they get popular. The stary is the first in my eyes to tick all the boxes.  It is lighter than all previous Eskateboards. Its motor is in the wheel and battery is in the deck Its much cheaper than other boards of similar spec The right balance of weight range amp speed.Ive backed them on kickstarter but be warned.

6122592,0,t3_3zew8q,There are a few different types of lithium ion battery depending on what ion is used. They have very different profiles.One example is LiFePO which is commonly used for elongboards. There are plenty on HobbyKing. Theyre generally considered safer less explody and are less fussy about being stored fully charged and being over or under charged etc.You may be thinking of the kind of Liion batteries you get in smart phones chemistries like LiCoO. These have really high energy density  you can get twice the energy in the same weight of battery compared with LiPoLiFe thats why theyre good for very thin phones  but they are a bit thermally unstable they overheat easily. This makes them unsuitable for highpower applications like eboards where a motor might be drawing very large currents.,ElectricSkateboarding,cylkpm3,1,t5_32hd6

And the ZBoard  is apparently a lot more responsive than the original was.Heres a comment from someone who has been betatesting the ZBoard  for a few months via the Facebook ZBoard  groupgt Foot pads cannot even compare to other controllers they are in a league of their own.

7206548,0,t1_d1x9j1z,The first one that caught my eye was the Boosted really love everything about that board except the range and the price especially in Denmark with the added on taxes and shipping.So I started looking for another board and stumbled upon Melon Magneto Luoov Lecdec etc. after reading some reviews I ruled them out because everybody said that they are low quality. Then I discovered Inboard and wow it sounds perfect! More range than the boosted high top speed no visible motors and no drag when battery is dead! The one thing that is a disadvantage is the not so flexible deck. Evolve is also very interesting as well especially their Bamboo series it is cheaper than Boosted and Inboard has way more range than both of them and it goes almost just as fast. It also has a very flexible deck and even a distributor in the UK which means the shipping wouldnt be as expensive and no taxes because it is inside the EU and if anything were to break it would be easy to get spare parts. The downside of the Evolve is the single motor  slow acceleration and I dont love the design.

But in their recent video Jason said there are making cheaper alternative for Raptor  instead of carbon fiber deck they will use wooden deck with enclosure. I was myself waiting with decision for my own board I was looking at Inboard Boosted Stary Enertion Evolve I finally decided I am going with my own DIY board.

There have been evolve GT owner who have said that if there is a slight incline the evolve GT wont brake to a complete stop.  with the GT you have to manually switch to reverse mode with a button.source,ElectricSkateboarding,d4d7ufv,3,t5_32hd6

Yes at the same cruising  speed a  w motor may only use a little more juice than  watt to maintain the same speed But the majority of the power is wasted in stop and go traffic to accelerate again. and I think its fair to say that most people are not trying to ride for efficiency under normal conditions.

8889352,0,t3_520a4n,I would say hold off on the Blink.  I bought a Blink Lite in July.  The hub motor is actually pretty good for what they claim.  However the battery is already down to  capacity after  miles used to go  miles on a charge now I barely get  miles.  Also the remote constantly disconnects while accelerating leaving you speeding up until it disconnects slow down until you get it to reconnect then back on the power again for  seconds until it does it again.Between the battery and the remotereceiver I would say do NOT get a blink board for a commuter board.  All that said if I had a lt year old kid this would be an amazing play in the front yard kind of toy.  EDITOkay so they just updated the app right after I posted this which allowed me to connect for the first time in a month and I found it was stuck in beginner mode.  I went out for a ride and learned two things. It went the same  miles it previously felt almost dead after and the app said the battery was still at .  However I had felt it slowly dropping in power over the last mile.  Im guessing in beginner mode that drop in performance equated to the motor putting out too little power to push me lbs up a mostly flat street.  Whereas before it went from manageable to dead now it goes from pretty good to manageable.  . Updating the app did nothing for the connection issues with the remote nor did it correctly keep any milage telemetry still say Ive only done  miles.  So in short same as I said above but the battery may not be as worn out as I originally thought. ,ElectricSkateboarding,d7gdhfo,2,t5_32hd6

9153704,0,t1_d8btyzg,I agree with most of what youve said although I would like to add Outrunner motors belt driven are actually easier to repair in the sense that less integration means its easier to diagnose problems and repair them. With hub motors if something goes wrong its time to replace the entire hub motor and Carvons specifically are not cheap Going with hub motors doesnt mean nothing needs to be adjusted.  Granted theres less but it isnt  absent.  For example screws nuts and bolts need to be regularly tightened components and wiring still need to be well protected etc. Hub motors have the huge capability of being more stealth which is why I want to have a build with them eventually With hub motors at least for now you are limited to the wheel style of the urethane surrounding the motors.   With belt driven boards you can use any type of wheels whether its regular urethane or pneumatic inflatable tires which can conquer pretty much any terrain.  To answer the OPs question I would say it varies between brands but hub motors will generally be quieter due to the lack of belt friction.  ,ElectricSkateboarding,d8caqpv,2,t5_32hd6

9340575,0,t1_d8zlrlv,I agree and dont doubt that at all. As I said I support an eboard kick starter company very similar to this and I just want to point out that these delays are timed to slowly release info even though they will always make it seem right around the corner. They know it is months if not years away from completion . A year ago before they announced their first delay I already projected one year minimum waiting while they only announced delays every few months. What is interesting to me is that mellow which finished crowdfunding around the same time announce their first delayed to be spring of . That is why no one is sitting around debating mellow yet they have released their progress without complaints and quite impressive progress . I think people are disillusioned to think that A newly crowd funded company with a prototype can produce a final product in less than a year when it has taken boosted and evolve almost  years to make significant third generation progress on their E boards. Dont get me wrong I appreciate your enthusiasm to support a company you got into.  I did and that is part of the excitement of anticipation. But I think expectations should be set at  month increments.Even slight changes take months. Its like Office Space over there . ,ElectricSkateboarding,d8zzhms,1,t5_32hd6

9568305,0,t1_d9sgoer,Given the same motor and wheel pulleys the bigger the wheel the more the speed but the less the torqueacceleration.  The smaller the wheel the more torqueaccelerationhill climbing you get.  There will probably be a  mph or so difference in speed if you get bigger wheels.  Bigger wheels give a more comfy ride over bumps and cracks only if you dont have a lot of bumps or cracks and roads are good then ride will be good with both sizes of wheels.  Usually most Esk companies offer  mm wheels standard.  Ollin offers mm so thats already bigger than most mm is the biggest wheel out there.  I think mm is a good balance for most people.  If you live in a mostly flat area you can go with mm or if you have poor roads the mm will help slightly.  ,ElectricSkateboarding,d9shm5c,1,t5_32hd6

10341776,0,t3_5o0hwx,Every new board seems to be hot and then die down after release.. might be because they all have issues. Best to research and talk to owners of each then buy whichever board comes with issues that you can tolerate best.The Inboard has a motor design which might be far from ideal for heavier people and those in hilly areas so such prospective buyers would likely be looking elsewhere.Evolve Carbon GT comes with a carbon deck that seems to have a penchant for snapping and a hairtrigger on its controller but is also one of the quicker and longer range boards out there and perhaps a better choice for heavier people especially in hilly areas... just dont be shocked if the deck gives up sooner or later. Bamboo GT might be a better choice than the Carbon GT from a durability perspective costs less but it does not come with as large a battery so range drops some. It comes with a wooden deck which may be considerably more durable than the carbon GTs deck and the flexible nature of the Bamboo might provide a more supple ride.Boosted had some issues with the batteries in their new board but appear to have them sorted. Perhaps the best controller out there. Polished boards perhaps the most polished and support is . Problem for some is that it cannot go faster than MPH since they are more concerned about staying legal under Californias regulations governing the use of electric skateboards.,ElectricSkateboarding,dcgas73,6,t5_32hd6

10851920,0,t1_ddz7dsg,Ill keep looking at the wheel. I think its just on there really tight. With enertion the drive system wheel pully comes off of the truck  so you could take it off the truck then extract the wheel pully from the back of the wheel which was what I was expecting but wasnt the case here. This is a guess but I think the wheel pully is attached to the truck so its awkward getting enough leverage to pop the wheel out. The phone app is really easy to use. This is the one I use The only other indicator is low voltage cutoff v where the board will start outputting less power. I havent hit that yet but from my experience with other boards the lowered performance is noticeable. When it happened with my other board it meant I had  miles left. When its triggered on this board theres about  miles left in the pack since this pack is so big which is plenty for me to get home. This can be tuned. That being said riding from a full state to depletion on this board would be a helluva endurance run. ,ElectricSkateboarding,ddzarh7,3,t5_32hd6
10852579,0,t1_ddz5fqz,No offense but unless you weigh like  pounds even then you are straight up lying. The voltage cutoff for the board is . volts and it switches over to ECO right around  volts  which gives plenty of leeway for the battery to discharge. Not only would the board not switch to ECO at  it wouldnt show  as sagging from higher voltages keeps the board from switching modes.        A few forum members including me have done a lot of calculations and we can go into more detail but the the heres the basic use case If you hammer it in GT mode the whole time you can get around  miles and then the battery will display  but it will sag too much from there to be able to use GT.

11500635,0,t1_dfz5b2y,Agreed. It sounds like a smart feature to me. Some people just get too cocky and filled with pride that they would jump to pro before theyre ready.  miles is nothing. People who want to use the mellow drive will get past that point in no time. It might infringe on your freedom to control it immediately out of the box but you still will get that control in the long run. ,ElectricSkateboarding,dfzlhxi,3,t5_32hd6

11614917,0,t1_dgcgs0t,The standard charger will be suitable but the top level of charge will gradually reduce provided the cgt owner actually plugs in and charged along with everybody. An evolve rider with a  amp charger can charge faster than a boosted board so it will be able to maintain a full charge again if the rider is willing to charge with the boosted riders.The size of the battery becomes somewhat immaterial if you are planning a ride that exceeds one charge. In that event the charge time is paramount. I was faced with a choice today. I had the option of riding alone and covering a tremendous amount of ground or riding with a group that would slow me down a whole bunch because even evolves with  amp chargers cant keep up with my  amp charger on my carvon. I can go  maybe  miles and charge back to full in about  minutes. The carbon gts with their big giant batteries would be holding me back by the third charge. Despite the fact that it would mean I skate less miles I chose the group because it is simply more fun to ride with others and socialize as well. I barely made one third of the trip I planned to make today but Im pretty sure I had more fun hanging out and riding with others. Discriminating against people because they have a board with different capabilities takes away from the fun of riding.,ElectricSkateboarding,dgck7dk,1,t5_32hd6

11636364,0,t3_661nwi,The Acton hate stems from the company telling us when they started the campaign last October that we have finished the development of all of these boards As it turns out they are still developing and designing the Qutroand just finished the S backers dont expect the Qutro for months.

11770851,0,t3_67ypr1,Hey all I did a quick calculation of motor gear  wheel gear  and wheel size ratio and the possible speed to achieve on an Evolve GT skateboard. I saw on the forum tequilaman verified that the motor gear of  teeth with  mm wheel size achieves mph thats slower than the calculated mph but probably due to increase wind resistance. The mm requires shaving mm off the width of the wheel to accommodate the rear wheel install.Is it possible to achieve the theoretical mph? or does the increase wind resistance at high speed make this not possible. Of course throw the acceleration factor out completely if you want to achieve the top speed.What is everyones sweet spot on torque and speed and wheel size. It a balance game between distance ride comfort torque and speed.,ElectricSkateboarding,dgu99v8,1,t5_32hd6
