3726287,0,t1_cqgieu8, seems a bit high but hes a Top  pick at this point. Hes hitting well showcasing solid tools and has a high probability of sticking at short in the majors. SwansonBregman might have to move off SS.,MLBDraft,cqh0sy7,2,t5_30653

4241760,0,t3_39fj0o,gtStewart is this class third best bat behind Dansby Swanson and Alex BregmanAre you high?EDIT Also calling Kevin Kramer org fodder is ridiculous. He could stay at short and end up a useful utility infielder. You dont take org guys in the third round.EDIT EDIT I think youre basing these guys waaay too much off of stats.

7883655,0,t3_4n95ky,I picked for the Braves for their first three picksRiley Pint  Im not a huge fan but I think hes a guy Coppy would be all over. Hes got the highest ceiling of anyone in the draft but can also bust. Hes got crazy velocity for someone of his age which makes me wonder of injury risk. I think realistically the pick will be either Pint Lewis or Ray.Taylor Trammel  We got a steal here. Hes been projected as the nd best prospect in Georgia behind Lewis and has been projected to go ish picks before where I picked him. Hes a multisport athlete that follows how the Braves love multisport athletes. He has been reported to have  grade speed and could develop some power. Hes projected to stay in CF.Gavin Lux  This is another guy Im surprised who stayed here for so long. Im a huge fan of this guy and think he can be a very special player. Hes a good defensive SS and has the potential to be a five player. Hes from a cold weather state and that may have put him under the radar. Whoever drafts this guy is going to be very happy I think. BA ranks him as the th best player in the draft.,MLBDraft,d42720p,1,t5_30653
