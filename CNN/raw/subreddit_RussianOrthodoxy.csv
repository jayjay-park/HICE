Inevitably certain things cannot be unheard and priests are just people but really the role of the priest in confession is merely to symbolize the people of the church and you are admitting your sins to the church the people asking for forgiveness.But I understand that your question has more to do with spiritual guidance I think its still a good question.,RussianOrthodoxy,d1eghgk,1,t5_38nz1
