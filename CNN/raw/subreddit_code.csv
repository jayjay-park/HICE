For that If your looking for a place to write your code I recommend Microsoft Visual Studio When you feel like you know c you should get Xamarin. There is a way to do it in Visual studio community  poke around in the new project area and youll find it. But if you didnt get visual studio you can download an environment and the libraries here ,code,d4gwgbz,1,t5_2qh32
