5272485,0,t1_cvll70z,Multiplayer games that are also exercise our just good multiplayer games? I am not too familiar with the Wii Mini but my understanding is it is just a smaller Wii with some minor differences. The main difference being that the original Wii can play GameCube games and the Mini cannot. ,wii,cvlmb3p,1,t5_2qi9g
5309189,0,t3_3n7icv,Id go for a Wii U.You can get a Deluxe one for  on sites like eBay coming with games too.The Wii U is literally a Wii U and a Wii so if you buy a Wii and then a Wii U later then the Wii is going to be useless.By the way Wii U games I recommend are   Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze Super Mario Maker Super Mario D World New Super Mario Bros. U New Super Luigi U Super Smash Bros. Mario Kart  Pikmin These are all first party games exclusive to the Wii U with the exception of Super Smash Bros. which is also available on the DS.  There are also a lot of great third party games such as Scribblenauts Unlimited Unmasked is not as good SteamWorld Dig Badland and the very best game of them all Cube Life Island Survival.  HAHAHA just kidding that is just a crappy Minecraft clone.There are also a lot of AAA games like Tom Clancys Splinter Cell Blacklist Assassins Creed  Batman Arkham City Armoured Edition and more but these have more content better graphics and run better as well as being cheaper on other platforms especially on computers with Steam.The Wii U is still infinitely better than the Wii though mainly because it can do almost anything a Wii can do.  Wiimotes and nunchucks are also compatible.,wii,cvqb6qr,1,t5_2qi9g

8190247,0,t3_4qfyjz,Id have to go with the Wii simply because of Super Mario Galaxy  amp  Kirbys Epic Yarn and Donkey Kong Country Returns. Of course it has other great games too but there is a limited number of PS games that truly interest me. Once upon a time I wouldve said the PS over the Wii as I was once a big JRPG fan but now I dont have the time nor the patience for them and the Wii hits that casual gaming sweetspot for me that most other consoles dont. I could are less about GTA or Gran Turismo or whatever else PS is known for. Plus if you include backwards compatibility I would take GameCube BC over PS BC any day.,wii,d51bz47,1,t5_2qi9g
