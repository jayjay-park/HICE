5436963,0,t1_cw5wb5l,I have a question and dont know if Ill be able to attend also what is your planed lag time between stream and archive available?gt Are you planning to have large fields where Mechs can roam around or will they be smaller skirmish fields?  An example would be the difference between  boards for Lance vs Lance or a x square for Lance Vs Lance.  A second example would be XCOM battle examples VS Shadowrun or MechCommander battles.,Battletechgame,cw6mjxu,1,t5_39c47
