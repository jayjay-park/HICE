248354,0,t3_1www7e,Ive been using Greensock for a couple years and I love it.  Unbelievably flexible and fast.  The ability to easily retime entire sequences of animations is pretty mindblowing.  Its also very modular without any other library dependancies.  Id give it a shot!,html5,cf6huqu,2,t5_2r7u2

Heres how you draw a rectangle on a canvasHTML    ltcanvas idcgtltcanvasgtJavascript    var canvas  document.getElementByIdc    var context  canvas.getContextd    context.fillRectx coord y coord rectangle width rectangle heightThats probably quite confusing itll make sense once you learn the basics. You can also use Javascript to move HTML elements and create animations that way.,html5,cg0ro2y,1,t5_2r7u2

4297853,0,t3_3a72qy,Flash is an animation tool that became a programming environment.  HTML is a programming environment that is becoming an animation tool.In the same sense that you never really programmed in Flash but in ActioonScript you do very little real programming in HTML.  The technolgy we call HTML is really much more about advances in CSS and JavaScript than HTML.CSS has some really nice animation features. You can transform in D and D you can move elements along a path and you can animate any numeric property and a few others like colors.Much of the simpler animation can be done with CSS but youll still want to be able to do this by hand as the tools arent yet as complete as Flash was in its prime.To get to the full power of HTML youll need to use JavaScript and the Canvas element.  This is not as easy as working in Flash was particularly for animation but it is well worth the effort because modern browsers can really do a lot.JavaScript and ActionScript are very closely related. The syntax is identical but the objects they use are different.  Its not a difficult translation.I know there are some tools out there that make working with HTML feel more like Flash but I really think its worth it to change your mindset and treat this as a programming environment.I have written books on game development in both Flash and HTML,html5,csa3apu,3,t5_2r7u2
6074566,0,t1_cyfujij,. of the web traffic today is probably equivalent to  of web traffic in . not sure about actual figures but you see my point. Yet in  that number of people was considered well worthy of service and quite serviceable yet is now considered justifiably ignored...  It may make sense if you are a small operation but if you are cnn or foxnews or frankly even if you have as little as  employees it actually would be affordable and financially justifiable to just higher someone else if necessary to make a javascript free version of your site. Its not the percentage that matters but the number of viewers and the amount of revenue per a viewer. If it added up to profit back then then it should still add up to profit now.Edit Im not interested in why i should trust javascript so it is off topic as far as i am concerned if you want to know why a lot of people dont trust it just go google that. Also while im here I want to point out that there are a lot of people who are sort of coaxed into enabling javascript because they decide to take risks even though they dont really want to just because they value the ability to view the content so you should keep in mind that that probably makes up a sizeable percentage of people with javascript enabled too. Its not quite a fair characterization to say you are serving that particular demographic just because they have given up and viewed your page with js enabled.,html5,cyfv1fu,0,t5_2r7u2

6443892,0,t3_43xq7x,I think what might be tripping you up is being a bit unfamiliar with what the HTML elements mean and what they represent along with how they are meant to be used.I wont go in to too much detail at work but heres a quick list of bullet points that might help you get in the right direction  HTML elements usually are a blocklevel element or an inline element  Blocklevel elements typically fill up their parent creating a block. Eg ltpregt ltdivgt ltpgt ltheadergt ltulgt lttablegt etc etc etc.   Inline elements usually only refer to the content which is contained within. eg ltemgt ltstronggt ltcodegt ltspangt etc.  Blocklevel elements can contain other blocklevel elements or inline elements. This can vary by tag though as ltpgtltemgtemphasizedltemgtltpgt is valid but lttablegtltemgtemphasizedltemgtlttablegt is not valid.  Inline elements should generally contain other inline elements or data ie text. ltpgtAA ltspangtBB ltemgtCCCltemgtltspangtltpgt is valid but ltcodegtltdivgt  ltdivgtltcodegt is not valid. ltcodegt is an inline element essentially just normal text flow shown with a monospace font ltpregt is a blocklevel element which shows the data contained with a monospace font and directly as it is defined in the markup. That is all spaces new lines etc are used. If you have new lines in your HTML thats probably why its adding extra linesetc in your page. Seeing as youre writing content which is placed in a Wordpress page the theme in use might be applying styles to the elements you use. Its possible the theme is adding marginspaddingborders to ltpregtltcodegt by default...,html5,czlu6so,2,t5_2r7u2

7485507,0,t3_4hwr84,Id say the easiest method would be to use wordpresscomicpress or find an online blog host like wordpresstumblr and upload your comics there.Making a template by hand without php or another dynamic language might be cheaper from a hosting standpoint but tbh youre going to either end up automating the process or doing all the html by hand once and copy and pasting the same page over and over again with some slight changes. Just setting up the initial template is going to mean learning css html and trudging out over a weekend or longer to first build a basic html page for a web comic then get it to look how you want in css then youll have to repeat if you want to add in a new web comic which probably means duplicating the html file and then just making changes to the file. Plus if you do anything with javascript theres always the chance that your page is crippled to search engines like google.Plus with Tumblr or wordpress you can always do manual tweaks in css with existing code so theres less work and tumblr has loads of css themes to work with as does wordpress.Heres an example of a web comic done in tumblrAs is one in wordpress,html5,d2t27o0,1,t5_2r7u2
