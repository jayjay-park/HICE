809515,0,t1_cgw96os,Might want to reread the article as the fertilizer was in a bigger unmarked bag. The whole following her home was because they didnt know whats in the bag. And if the initial test is so inaccurate they should not base warrants on it. The lady had personal amounts and No pot plants. If she got pulled over for a routine stop and cops found this she most likely would have gotten a town ordince ticket as even the local cops know that they should be focused on the herion and other shit that is actually killing people.  ,chicagotrees,cgwaojt,1,t5_2slgc
897594,0,t3_24edmt,dude If you are gonna be here during the summer.  There are block parties literally every weekend.  Usually they have live music Sometimes popular stuff that you would be into BBQ art vendors all kinds of shit.  Also there are the festivals.  Lollapalooza popular stuff Spring awakening EDM everywhere Wavefront House and NorthCoast pretty balanced not a ton of live music but a lot more than spring awakening or wavefront,chicagotrees,ch6b7lj,7,t5_2slgc

Theyre doing this thing called summer dance fest where a band plays for free and they even have dance lessons before they get started. Id also check out some of the neighborhoods like Pilsen and lakeview for food. But if youre smoking def Pilsen. God I love Pilsen. ,chicagotrees,cjq2ap7,2,t5_2slgc

2470407,0,t1_cmh1a47,Yeah that would be my guess. I got lucky with my piece wish I remembered the artist name. He was one of the guys in the Documentary Degenerate Art and I want to say was from Seattle. The day I bought it a buddy had put that documentary on and the name was still fresh in my head. The guy at the shop kept mentioning its his last piece by so and so that he would have for a while and that it was good. Something like  years later and dozens of falls on to concretewoodrandom surfaces and its still going strong. ,chicagotrees,cmh1hv7,2,t5_2slgc

9674818,0,t3_5dlsd6,Illinois has a very short list of qualifying conditions. It is also a quite expensive and time consuming application process. Colorado Washington and Oregon can give you the freedom to experiment with treatment options to see if the therapy is right for you. If you have the liberty to move for a trial it might be worth your while. I dont know your budget. All three of those states are beautiful places to live with friendly local populations and highly qualified budtenders. I have Crohns.
