5570748,0,t1_cwnl0cr,Theyre facing a combination that isnt even using a Winston so this should have been the time for her to shine yet at  the ultimate is fully absorbed by a single Lucio ultimate.   the enemy Lucio completely wastes his for no reason and gives them a window but their own Zarya lands hers and near wipes them because they arent holding any defensive abilities of their own.  No Winston.  Wasting Lucio ultimates on the push in because they have no proper shield tanks to push in behind.   The  Zarya ult should have done nothing because the enemy had pushed out into a dumb position but they arent running counters whatsoever.  Even so it still just gets reset by a Mercy res.By  theyre blindly piling onto a point wasting their Lucio ultimate too early again because they arent using a Reinhardt to push in with and they get wiped again because theyre blowing all of their defensive shit at the wrong times.They do manage to secure the point eventually sure but its after the enemy Lucio mistimes his ultimate and because they have a Roadhog and Zarya who cant actually offer anything to defend against it.That was a pretty ideal team for a Zarya to face and they still had a lot of trouble depsite going largely uncontested.  He only whiffed one ultimate hitting one person all the rest were  targets at least and they still couldnt capitalize on them very much.  None of those people would have ever died on defense with a good Winston bubble or a Reinhardt shield raised the whole time theyre pulled in and if those were Reinhardt knock downs the Lucio would have never had a chance to defensively ultimate they would have been wiped and taken the point on the very first push.,Competitiveoverwatch,cwnlpcv,1,t5_34fcy

Instead they should find like minded people that they can work well with and just play in open tournaments and keep improving as a group because that is what matters. On top of that this isnt really like a college scene for football where there are scouters. Youll get noticed by tournament results.

You arent really giving any input at all.  of your post is just bashing me.The only thing I got from your post is Guardian angle. Which I do. Often.

You have to take into consideration that by focusing her youre leaving your team open to be attacked by mercys team.I dont get what you are trying to say. Are you saying that by sending in your flanker you leave your team vulnerable? Or by focusing all damage on her leaves your team vulnerable? If its the first one then you should be sending in someone that can get around unnoticed and swiftly take the healer out. The benefit is almost always better than the cost in this case. Youre either down a ver or you take the healer down. If its the second one then yeah while  of you are trying to kill one person the other  enemies can just take their sweet time damaging you and your team.

Damn they gotta nerf Reaper.gt take mei or roadhog which have basicaly the same role theirs counterplay even if you are in their deadzone.Roadhog being one of the worst heroes considering him being a walking ult chargeup station doesnt drop as quick as McCree yet can still pretty much oneshot squishies with almost nothing you can do about once you are hooked. And he has  shots left. Hell he could even deal . damage with his combo and I still think it wouldnt make him really viable. His problem is not that his strenghts are too weak but his weaknesses are.gt I dont think buffing another sniper would fix the widow issue because it just replaces it with the problem that you need a sniper in every team. Imo a competitive team should work without a sniper.That was one of the heroes I adressed that might need some tuning. There are plenty of others who could use some tuning. While I do hope that we see Widow getting a lower charge rate on her shots I would much rather see other heroes getting a bit more attention so we have more options for compositions and ultimately that can affect a shift away from Widow aswell.gt Soldiers ult counters good positioning and compensates for lack of awareness of the soldier player.We are talking about competitive here. So I would assume we are talking about really good players. While the auto aim is nice and you get the benefit of spraying away with no bullet miss you also get a highly reduced reload time which is the big kicker for the ult. What makes the ult kinda sucky tho is that you cannot headshot with it so you have a tradeoff here.

7872353,0,t1_d40tmmo,Came to say something similar and then started thinking more in depth...Im going to go more general and talking strictly payload game mode. This is just how I have tried to play thus far in semiserious play. I would define a good team comp as the following x Tank w shield deploy Winston OR ReinhardtSomeone to sit on the payload and push the opponent back. The shield is key to protect teammates also playing the payload. x MercyHer rezs are too valuable to ignore. You could run double Lucio instead but other than that I would say Mercy is almost required. x hero w slow stun or additive health abilitiesThis is added support. You cant expect Mercy to be every where. The abilities these characters have are a good way to fill the gap. Zarya Lucio Zenyatta Symmetra Mei Torbjorn No Soldier. He fits better in another category. nonmobile or semimobile DPS heroBy nonmobile I mean heroes who cant change positions quickly and often. These heroes play the payload sit behind the shield and cause choas. Reaper Pharah McCree Soldier  Junkrat Bastion D.va RoadhogThe group I named above is the main group that should be consistently and constantly playing the payload. They should be moving together and grouping up when needed. x Flanker or SniperWith these heroes its less important that they play the payload but should still stay close while trying to pick off opponents from the group. You could probably have one of these and instead have a wild card hero.

Bastion might be easy to shoot at but he is quite special case.So yeah she is among the easiest targets to shoot at.

7892380,0,t3_4ndb7v,I want to address a problem with how you approach your post though this does not necessarily invalidate your conclusion. When people talk about a game being casual or hardcore the vast majority of the time they are talking about this as if it is one factor on one axis. Its like there is an imaginary knob that you could turn one way or the other. Turn it one way and you get DOTA turn it the other way and you get HOTS.But this is really not the case. What instead happens is that there are a huge number of factors that on their own can be very casual or very hardcore and the combination of those factors results in how accessible and how deep something is but accessible and deep are not mutually exclusive. Games can be really deep with a ton of hardcore features while still being accessible enough for casual players.Okay Ill quit it with the quotes. Just know I dont think highly of these terms as descriptorsSo when Blizzard made Hearthstone there are a million different ways that they could make Magic the Gathering more casual but they only did so in ways that made it more accessible without sacrificing depth. For example changing mana from something that was played with cards to a set resource that builds each turn definitely made the game more accessible by a huge margin. It makes deck building easier for people and games easier to follow. Did this also take away some of the depth? Well usually when you get rid of any factor it takes away some complexity which technically makes it have less depth but this change also makes games more consistent no getting manascrewed and opens up different ways to build decks.Am I saying this change was objectively better? No but this is an example of how something can appeal to both hardcore and casual gamers and how something can increase both the depth and accessibility of a game.As for an example that does not build depth and inhibits accessibility I would look to Lcanceling but Im not going to get into thatSo the question that we are trying to answer is not how casual or hardcore these hitboxes are but are they sacrificing depth for accessibility or viceversa and is there a way we can have both?And to be honest I dont think the hitboxes help the game on either account. I dont buy your argument that the game needs to make Widowmaker appealing and easy to use in order for the game to be accessible. For one games of this type usually have heroescharactersclassesweapons that are high riskhigh reward. Team Fortress  has the Spy class Super Smash Bros. has Ryu and many games including this one have snipers. Snipers are supposed to have a ton of downsides and be difficult to use but offer great reward to those who can use them well. They are not supposed to be for everyone who plays the game.gtHowever consider changing the hitboxes to match the models and what affect that would have on Widowmaker. For the very skilled she would not be much worse. The people that can aim can still hit the model with reliable accuracy. However the vast majority of people would find her considerably worse and find themselves often contributing nothing. That would be markedly unfun for those people.This is precisely what is supposed to happen. It is supposed to be unfun to play a sniper if you do not know what you are doing because and this is a key element that your analysis is missing it is really unfun to fight a sniper especially if you are new. It is incredibly frustrating to be killed across the map by a character you did not even know was there. At lower skill levels when you do not know the map or the sightlines this feels like you cannot do anything to counter it. At higher levels when you have a better game sense you generally have a better idea of what you can do to beat snipers and where you went wrong if you get killed by one.In other words when snipers dominate the lower levels it makes the game less accessible and less deep which hurts both hardcore and casual gamers.,Competitiveoverwatch,d436dtt,42,t5_34fcy

7897255,0,t1_d42x46t,Supports shouldnt have to be healers though. And symettra is a support. Her teleporter can be the difference between losing or contesting a point. Supporting the team by getting them back in the action.  Yeah rez is faster but only if mercy is there not dead has her ult and makes it back in time to rez more than  or  people. But add symettra teleporter and mercy becomes that much more effective. Plus Her turrets dont just kill people they slow them and can be used as an early warning to flanks etc. The problem is most players just try to set up kill rooms or whatever which while effective is far from the only way to play her. Her shield also make it so that tracer and Zen dont get one shot and can be the difference between dieing and making it to a health pack or lasting long enough for a healer to get therr. Stack that shield with armor from torb on your teammates and they are a lot harder to kill. Mercy goes up to  health but a higher ehp due to the armor so she can take even more damage. Etc etc. This is something I see more andore of lately against good teams. Torb symettra and Zen plus Reinhardts and two anything else. Makes Zen extremely annoying to try and take out before the rest of his team decimates yours one by one ad he orbs you from behind a shield. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d43q3y2,2,t5_34fcy

7899625,0,t3_4nfrud,Had this happen to me once on Hanamura but i was on a team with my friends friends so basically a pug. I remember starting off as lucio to heal everyone then after finding out everyone was Torb i went winston to be able to jump to point A. Took a good while since most of my team was stubborn in switching had a Rein a hanzo a genji   and...a tracer... Once i switch to winston and some others went like mercy and junkers we took point a kinda fast. Honestly the only useless one felt tracer.  Always dying to the  other turrets shooting at her while she tunneled .So point A is taken and now we head to point B.  This is where my hopes of beating  Torbs not only goes down the drain.  It gets decapitated defecated on and thrown down a river just to be eaten and defecated on by fish...So as soon as Point A is taken I suggest to our tracer to switch since shes not able to go in and staying as her would only make things difficult on herself. Id have better luck convincing a brick wall that its a balloon... spoiler she never switched until literally the last minute so the team is trying its hardest. Where all withing reasonable distance.  Im trying to go in as winston from the left side and rein from the main entrance and this is where our teamwork falls off.  I ping and ping telling everyone to go in. E to the middle tesla low health  Q actually kill  wears off die. ah damn. Well at least wrecked a bit  hopefully the team takes advantage. nope. After i die rein is still at the entrance THEN charges in alone  and dies. Our genji is now hanzo so now its  of them and  is mercy helps decently. Then were held off for the next  minutes of the match.  I went widow then stayed as phara since i was able to drop  turrets before Id die rein went roadhog for a bit then back to rein one hanzo went widow then back to genji and tracer stayed until the last possible minute then went phara...Sorry for the long what is basically a rant but what Im trying to get at is you can learn all these comps and all these counters but nothing is going to work if you dont have coordination and at least a competent  team.,Competitiveoverwatch,d43zpt4,2,t5_34fcy

7957196,0,t3_4o8lf6,This data was taken from Captain Planets weekly report This data set has the hero limit and features zero assaultcp maps of course.  The Y axis is the total number of picks minus the number of controlkoth picks i.e. the sum of the escortpl offense picks and the escort defense picks. The X axis is the percentage of this data thats escort offense.  Data towards the top means a heros a more popular pick and data towards the right means the heros played more on offense than defense.  The bottom of the chart is kinda meaningless since the heroes were played so sparingly. Zenyatta was only played on control so he doesnt appear on the chart.  The interesting things that I took away are that Widowmaker and Reinhardt are more common than McCree on escort maps in general. Which makes the widowmaker nerf make more sense. Reinhardt is also looked as indispensable for escort unlike on control. McCree was still high up though.   Zarya and Pharah have almost identical usage rates both in frequency and bias.

I think they are looking at top level plays where the quantum scope was happening  hero limitation and forced particular composition just because widowmaker exists.It takes away from widowmaker v widowmaker fights  but not from the GAME overall. The game gains from the nerf by increasing viable team compositions and plays by other heroes. It was not unexpected but slightly disappointed that high level revolved around sniper fights but perhaps blizzard wants to move away from that being the high level end game?

Now there will be times where you do play correctly and its your teammate that misplayed but you will never improve redirecting blame away from yourself. Theres always something you can improve on even if it is how you could of communicated better to your team in that situation.Record your games you can stream your games to twitch and make sure you have the setting to record broadcasts on or by saving to your comp with a program like OBS. Its better to really focus and get good practice in instead hrs of bad practice. After a few hours you would end up playing sub optimally which then makes all the games after bad practice. Instead take a moment and review your matches you just played. Try to ask yourself what you could of done differently how you could of helped a teammates where you should of been positioned what you could have played or changed in team comp etc. Also take note of the enemy team and what they are doing right. Its hard to break things down at first looking at things like if i hit this shot i would of been ok or if X didnt happen. But try to look beyond that to the macro play what you could do to help the team win the game. your shot will improve with play and focus but dont get caught up on missed shots.Along with watching your own vods watch pro tournament vods. this will help you analyze what they are doing in relation to your own patterns and help you fix a blinding error in your play that you thought was fine. Like all the pub players that try to defend the at the spawn doors or right next to it then die and attacker get a free point because youre running back from spawn trying to set up but they are already in position to kill you.Before you even play watch a vod. this will get you mentally prepared to play correctly right out the bat. And any misplays or problems in your play spend the day and focus on correcting that. If you play widow then learn that grapple hook snipes or if you think you are playing too aggressive then try and not die. Dont narrow your hero pool too much. Keep a decent rotation if you play with a group where you know tanksupport are filled then focus on having a strong rockpaperscissors hero select I main support but knowing phara to counter junkrat and  to counter phara etc. have a solid line up that can combat any hero so you are never countered out of the game.,Competitiveoverwatch,d4bt1ei,5,t5_34fcy

What I mean is the front of the payload is always forward  or the back of point A as we assault it is the part furthest from us. While this means call outs change as the payload progresses since the payload is the point of the map and the central focus for most fights this tends to work very well. One additional thing is to always call out by character name not player name. Friendly mercy good Rez! Enemy widow down push now! That sort of thing.

8016906,0,t1_d4h63v1,I think what theyre saying or at least what I believe to be the case behind switching and losses being connected is that when you are losing you have a reason to switch if you win a fight you have no reason to switch unless youre trying to preempt a switch from the enemy team. This leads to teams switching after losing fights to try something different there may also be a correlation between switching and losing ultimate charge and losing but this is all just conjecture. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d4h6atr,2,t5_34fcy

8037656,0,t1_d4jd74i,A tie isnt a waste when it is an uncommon occurrence but in Overwatch youll probably tie the majority of your nonKotH games if it is just based off of successfully completing a payload push. The game is stacked towards offense. All you need is one ult push in and you win. The defense has to stop push after push after push with no mistakes. Will defense win occasionally? Sure. But especially in higher MMR youll nearly always see attack win.So youll be getting draws for nearly all your matches. That means no progression up a ranked ladder. Which means the competitive mode is pointless.It matters what minute you score because the defenses job is to prevent the payload from moving to the end. If the defense makes the payload take longer to move to the end than the other team that defense has defended better or the attackers have done a poorer job at attacking. Either way you spin it a time difference indicates one side performing worse than the other. Thats what losing is in a zero sum game.,Competitiveoverwatch,d4jiah6,1,t5_34fcy

Whether or not you consider this cheese is irrelevant.You cant measure the heroes efficiency by just counting them its not that simple. Two Winstons arent twice as efficient as one Winston theyre many times more for various reasons Im sure youre aware of. Even if it gets nerfed as long as the nerf doesnt completely invalidate the second Winston there would still be scenarios where double Winston is  efficient for the job more than any combination of two different heroes. Just because theyre less efficient overall as in arent broken doesnt mean theyre completely inefficent.

8106022,0,t1_d4qzapa,Blizzard said they wanted McCree to be strong against Tracer Genji and Reaper when doing the nerfs but I have to say post nerf he LOT weaker against than Genji before and his damage thresholds are completely changed on reaper so I say that didnt really fullfill that goal completely.When I was mathing things out I really didnt think they would go below  damage per shot so killing tracer and hp characters would stay the same but I guess they wanted McCree below the  hp mark which I guess is ok.Speed buff to spray would be a good idea. A alternative I like is make it damage drop off based per shot landed from a fan. Doing a simple formula of  with a total damage still resulting in  damage with all shot landing. Basically first shot that lands does  damage following shot will do  then  ect. This would give McCree back the power he needs to down those Flankers and lowhp characters in a timely manner since most of the damage is at the start of Fan but total damage output is identical to post nerf against tanks.,Competitiveoverwatch,d4r6u0b,35,t5_34fcy

8107694,0,t1_d4rb2nh,Looking good dude! The only change Id make is renaming result to something more obvious like hit reduction or having an explanation somewhere to make it clear or both.Edit This is somewhat unrelated but might be interesting. Your dimensions are attack e.g. Zarya leftclick target e.g. Tracer and hit e.g. nonboosted critical. Lets call these A T and H respectively. The current layout is TbyH with a page for each element of A.This is great for answering questions like As McCree which target does Mercy help me against the most. You go to the McCree page limit A to one element and compare the result column along the Taxis.What if youre interested in answering something like If I have a Mercy damage boosting me who should I pick to kill Reaper in the fewest hits?. Youd have to go through every page and there are a lot of them.With pages in the H dimension you could have a AbyT table for each hit category so youd have  total pages instead of . It would be similar to Pokemon type effectiveness tables The rows would be attacks columns would be targets. The boxes would display number of hits required to kill. There would be  pages one for each hit category boosted critical etc.. Or just  pages  the boxes would show the result columns from critical and noncritical hits.Anyway Im not really suggesting that you do this  it answers different questions from what you set out to answer.

8201859,0,t1_d52qqtb,In my personal opinion players should just be more willing to learn the other roles which is a bit contradictory coming from me because In soloduo I have a pretty strict high impact hero selection but I have a track record of carrying hard when I play them. For example my friend and I are very knowledgable of the meta and some of the more detailed map strategy so we played double tracer on a KotH map. Our Lucio made a big stink about it all match long saying such things as stop making this harder than it needs to be this stupid double tracer thing is screwing us get on the point Im carrying you guys. By the end of the game we had gold and silver in all categories but healing and the enemy team even made it a point to say your tracers carried your whole team but the Lucio still insisted we were dragging the team down. My simple response was do some research and learn how to play the maps and whats good.But this example shows exactly how people will look for any reason to shift the blame off themselves and Chalk their poor performance up to a bad team. Now this can be possible if you play a role that requires more team play than others it can be difficult to do well if your team is not doing their jobs efficiently so its a bit of a paradox. There are a lot of good reasons why players end up playing dps and auto locking Genji but as a general rule in order to improve and climb you have to have the good sense to let a more skilled player into the specific role they want.This is why I think the babys first scoreboard thing needs to go away in competitive you need quick and easy stats during the game and a way to check profiles that show performance ratios with all heroes. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d52sb9t,0,t5_34fcy

8205343,0,t1_d531emx,But its not skewed towards teams who are better at KotH.  If they are better at KotH then they are worse at payload by definition and will likely not be brought into a sudden death situation in the first place.  Sudden death should not come to a coin toss period.  It makes no sense.  When all things equal one side has a competitive advantage because the map is uneven.  KotH is equal for everyone and if youre not as good at it as the other team you deserve to lose.I dont see how an argument can be made for this.  Payload maps work because both teams play both sides in a set.  If it comes down to a sudden death everything possible should be done to ensure that the playing field is equal.  It should be based on player skill.  Being at a disadvantage because you dont practice a certain game mode is very different than being at a disadvantage because of a coin toss.Edit Grammar,Competitiveoverwatch,d5380qc,1,t5_34fcy

8206353,0,t1_d53b7oh,A number of ways.  First wed have to know the demographics that lead to an increase in our performance statistics.  Lets go with a simple model to illustrate the pointReapers performance statistics in this model are Objective Kills. Tanks Killed. Objective Time. Damage dealt. Kills.In that order.  Say the correct play is to stop the flanking Tracer from hitting your healers.  Well that factors at the bottom of this list damage and kills and you can get a LOT MORE of both anyway by running into tanks on the frontline stealing damage from your bastion as it were who is handling the situation just fine.  This gets you ALL of the factors and much more of all of them but decreases your chances of winning.Its a crude example but I hope its clear.  Anyone whos serious about these kinds of statistics will tell you they are correlation not causation.  Getting objective kills will not intrinsically give you a win.  Getting a win will however intrinsically give you more objective kills on the usual.  The difference is the focus.  If youre focusing on padding stats then you can do so without them actually meaning anything.  If youre focusing on winning which is what OW is trying to get us to do then the stats will just come naturally.  The problem is too many people will be focused on the statistics rather than smart game play.  If you need proof just look at LoL  Most damage on team most damage taken highest KDA and most cs on the map yet I still lose  of my games.  Okay youre making stupid calls at stupid times causing a throw which loses you the game.The thing most people dont realize is that  of your damage you deal  out of  elims you participate in  of whatever metric you want to look at are completely useless.  They didnt really do anything for the match other than trading damage.  Its the crucial three or four plays in each match that determine its outcome assuming its not a steamroll or stonewall.  You try to capture these moments inside of those statistics  the more damage youve done the more likely it was that you contributed to the damage at that crucial moment  but you can also inflate the stats meaninglessly which inflates the bias of the system and ranks you unfairly in that game.EDIT  Pro games illustrate that last point better than anything.  The teams who capitalize off of these crucial moments the best are the ones who win even if it looked like the other team was making headway.  It happens all the time youll hear the announcers voice getting highpitched screaming out random player names and plays at the top of his voice as fast as he can but he cant keep up because its all going so fast and theres another death and two deaths on the other side OH MY GOD MERCY JUST GOT A FIVE MAN REZ this is so insane theres the Zarya and Pharah ult combo and this game...is over!  Thats what wins games.  Not  damage dealt.  Its the  damage inside of that  damage that won the game at that crucial moment in that crucial location.

Not that it is hard to hit his bombs in choke points but other than on defense maps I just dont see the purpose of him when you can just pick Pharah and have higher mobility and can hit rockets reliably directly on target instead of maybe hitting someone with a bomb.Also Pharahs ult is better in my opinion as it is instant and therefore combos better with other ults. Where as junkrat is kind of meh once people start listening for it and just shoot it before it kills them.  the animation and time for it to travel to the location makes it much harder to time with other CC ults such as Reinhardt and Zarya.,Competitiveoverwatch,d56hv32,1,t5_34fcy

In addition we always intended Mercys Damage Boost beam to be her primary method for dealing damage but it often felt so weak that you were better off pulling out your blaster.

Some maps allow you to fly to rooftops and use high ground to line of sight that way so take advantage of that when you can.The best thing that works for me is to emphasize taking out all the threats that give you issues while flying IE the mccrees soldiers widows bastions turrets. After that take air control and snowball from there.Theres really not a whole lot you can do to out maneuver hitscan heroes which if you think about it is literally every hero that does well against pharah.If you have a pocket mercy things go a lot differently and you can challenge hit scan heroes with mobility aim and sustainability.

Either helps your team out and I dont think you should be discouraged from doing one because it wont charge your ult. As for how difficult your Mei play is I dont disagree that it requires little skill. But there are so many things in Overwatch that dont require skill in terms of aiming but require good tactical thinking or instinct. This is one example and that should be both rewarded and encouraged in my opinion.As with most things I think the truth is somewhere between our points  Perhaps selfheals should charge your ults but significantly less than other things? It seems like a system designed to reward doing what you do well  whether thats healing other characters or hurting them  should also reward players healing themselves since otherwise you discourage using that vital tactical tool.,Competitiveoverwatch,d5bit1p,3,t5_34fcy

This happens a lot with Symmetra too.Objective time well having at least one member of your team be on the objective is how overwatch is won but having all members of the team on the objective is how overwatch is lost. So getting objective time medals doesnt necessarily mean youre doing anything positively correlated with winning.Damage as an isolated stat doesnt make you win period. Because of the way supports charge ult theres such a thing as bad damage.I think generally you can judge if the healers are doing poorly if they dont have gold healing or silver if theres two of them. Exceptions may exist but this one is a somewhat usable metric.Theres countless things that arent recorded in the medalgiving stats but do contribute to winning such as distracting enemies or just about anything Mei does edit for clarity with her ice walls.

8296359,0,t3_4t3fo1,EnVyUsthe exIDDQD core have not even been the singular consistently dominant team in Overwatch for long enough to start talking about whether its healthy and honestly that entire discussion is a bit silly anyway. What are you gonna do ask them to tone it down a bit for the good of the spectators? If a team is dominating its on the other teams to step up to their level thats all there is to it. You see it in many other games  the dominant runs of NiP and Fnatic in CSGO NaViAllianceEGSecretetc in Dota  and so on. Dominant teams shift and change and rise and fall with the changes of the meta the scene and many other factors.Recently there was C before C theres been ReunitedFnatic Melty Hubris NotEnigmaMixupLuminosity  there have actually been a lot of dominant teams in Overwatch throughout the beta and now release. EnVys current streak may be the most dominant one weve seen since release but that really is all you can say about it and its no wonder when they have the best Pharah and arguably best Mercy in the world in a PharahMercy meta and a team of players around them who are pretty much all top  in the world minimum at their respective roles. Theyre also just one of the most versatile and dynamic teams right now with a lot of luxuries in their favour like having HarryHook on support who is also a morethancapable DPS and having INTERNETHULK who can play pretty damnnear any hero in the game to a very high standard.The only things really to take away from all this including the finals which were also nowhere near as hard of a roll as people are making them out to have been EnVyUs showed very clear signs of mortality on Lijiang and Kings Row alone are that C have dropped off a bit Code are on the rise and should see new sponsorship soon and probably from a higherprofile org than Gale Force the old IDDQD core are still in godlike form several meta shifts later and NicolasTJO in particular is a player to watch carefully going forward. If he can keep up his current level of performance in the upcoming meta where its likely that Pharah will be much less viable hes definitely gonna be a strong contender. Thats not to say that the rest of Code werent also putting on a damn good show especially Harbleu showing off his old roamer chops with the frequent highimpact flank plays but Nicolas seems to be a possible rising star for sure.,Competitiveoverwatch,d5elq6o,1,t5_34fcy

Can you reliably hit headshots when playing as solider ? What about roadhog? Essentially there are many different small things you can do in game that if you start doing them natrually will give you the leg up in any scenario.. Positioning do you know why youre standing on top of gas station on Route  when defending the first point? What about when youre playing soldier are you playing with your tanks and letting them use their kits effectively? The problem with solo queue is that people are going to sometimes play what they want regardless of whether or not it directly benefits the team. You have to work around that if youre going to climb ranks.. Lastly if you want some more concrete advice please try to record some matches where youre doing both good and bad so people can point out specific aspects of your gameplay to improve upon. As a side note when i was an invite player in the old cod days watch demos. Watch so many demos youre tired of watching demos then watch more.

8324305,0,t1_d5hb896,The bigger problem is that people classify themselves largely on either their current rank or their peak rank. Neither of those are perfect snapshots to point to. Peak rating is obviously not a good thing to point to when it comes to skill because if that was the case then it wouldnt be a peak. Current rating on the other hand can also be misleading because someone can easily have a minor dip in win rate to see  or  ranks go poof. Likewise the reverse can happen. Someone can go on a minor spike in win rate to see  or  ranks come in. Obviously there are also longer streaks that can take place. Thats why I prefer to look at trends since you can easily find someone in the th percentile one day the next be at th percentile with being at the th the next day. Right now assuming this isnt by design the bell curve is weighted heavily toward the center which means just moving a few skill points can jump you massively when in reality you might even be playing a tiny bit worse than your average. We need to focus more at trends rather than snapshots.,Competitiveoverwatch,d5i3d5q,1,t5_34fcy

8341269,0,t3_4ttqkg,The problem with supports is that up until Ana theyve had fairly low skill ceilings. They were also low impact on outcomes compared to the performance of your DPS. Its not that they arent favoured its that theres no reason for the top players to play them.Maybe Ana will change this but even if she doesnt its a step in the right direction.Coin flip is irrelevant. If its truly a coin flip then your win loss will be  and your net rank gainloss will be entirely down to your personal performance. I can see why in the short term people dont like it but in the long term its kind of irrelevant. The draw mechanic will achieve the exact same thing but with less short term variance.,Competitiveoverwatch,d5k7ny5,1,t5_34fcy

8352019,0,t1_d5ljumz,The argument does apply for other heroes but in particular McCree and Widowmaker prove to be larger problems.Tracer and Genji have to be relatively close to you to do damage and even if Genji uitilizes his skill flawlessly it wont seem that strong. On the other hand if McCree hits all his shots youre going to completely solo carry and destroy the game.The reason for this is that many people can play tracer and genji to a very optimal level aimwise and mechanic wise but McCree is almost impossible to play perfectly. Even the pros miss almost half the shots they take and even with a  accuracy you will be destroying games as McCree with this most recent patch.Timing abilities well is proper play and is rewarded but doing so isnt that difficult. McCrees skill ceiling is essentially just too high and there isnt really any counterplay besides hiding behind shields.this comes from a McCreeWidow main so Im not biased against high skill ceilings or anything I just see that they dont really fit into Overwatch,Competitiveoverwatch,d5lk09b,4,t5_34fcy

8404415,0,t1_d5s1qrl,Personally I find  heroes quite interesting at least on a technical and strategic level. The hero limit allows individual players to have a much bigger impact on the game and forces teams to play smarter. The reason cancer comps suck so much as a spectator is that theres very little strategy the game amounts to team always running at the point while mashing their active abilities. Having  unique skill sets forces a team to work together to properly combo their abilities or die to another team doing the same.   Also what makes you think having  HL is going to bring diversity and skill? No limits on heroes results in stacking the most broken hero HL  results in teams playing the  best heroes why do you think HL  isnt going to result in  of the bestbest hero and then the other  slots being the ndth best heroes? In fact if you look at the games that have most influenced OWs design TF LoL DotA youll see a strict metagame focused around running the exact same kind of team comp every match.

8405377,0,t3_4urgpk,I think the obvious thing to rework on Symmetra is probably her shield since it feels like such a passive and lowimpact spell. Id want to preserve the element of defensive casting as well as providing a spell that feels like part of a supports kit but which does not rely on healing since thats an area to be unique. Reworked Photon Shield Symmetra casts a hard light shield on an ally which lasts for X maybe . to  seconds. For the duration of the shield the targeted ally cannot drop below hp. Cooldown one of the longest in the game for a nonultimate ability. Maybe  seconds because anything less than this would get really frustrating to fight against.Potential addon While the shield is on you your movespeed is increased by X Most of the time this ability would be used to allow allies to escape on low HP. It would also have great situational synergy with a lot of channeled ultimates like Pharas. Most importantly this would be an active and unique support spell.

8409193,0,t3_4uq2ui,Thanks for your analysis which in my view is to  correct. The question is how to change things without messing up completly the game. I have made up my mind already in rOverwatchUniversity with some suggestions which I would like to share to get your feedback. I have also included some additional changes to nondefense heroes Changes to defensive HeroesgtSymmetra Make her turrets little healing stations like the dispenser in TF healing a small amount hp  s but also keep existing functionality. Make the healingamount stack with more turrets  so maximum of  turrets would be hps. This would be a completly new mechanic as stationary heal is not in the game. gtMei Increase mobility with cryofreeze glide Make her primary fire shooting in front of her a small speedbuff of  to her and maybe to teammates as well. Her kit is very interesting though and she found some use in last weekend tourneys on kings cross. gtBastion Many hardcounters genji Tracer pharah. Integrate a front shield which can be actiavted for  seconds for  HP with a  sec. cooldown.gtHanzo Give him double jump or wall jump for increased mobility. Reduce cooldown of his radar arrow a bit to make him more viable in defense. Make him move faster with knocked arrows. gtJunkrat In low levels he is strong due to his Spam capabilities. In high Tier hardly picked. Make is projectiles move a little faster. Maybe also include TimerSetting for his grenades which you can toggle e.g. with the mousewheel in regards to the situation from  seconds or smth. . This would implement another skill for Pro  good players to set the timer according to the situation but would not be imbalanced for low  mid level play. gtTorbjorn Turrets have many hard counters. Maybe increase the lock time a little bit but also increase the damage output of the turrets. gtWidowmaker change of McCree  increase of bodyshot damage to old value. She has been nerfed very hard lately quickscope ultcosts damage.Changes to other HeroesgtPharah Nerf McCree to    extended damage and she is back in the game again. Change her duck button mid air to descend quite fast to give her more manuverability to avoid hitscan counters. gtAna Maybe to new to be in the meta. Should be watched over for the next months. Thoughts would be to integrate a mobility feature for her to reach high ground high Jump with boost as beeing pharahs mom ?gtMercy Slightly buff dmg amplify to   from gtMcCree Nerf McCree to    extended damage. Increase FtH Damage lightly to make it viable again.gtRoadhog Fix the hurtbox of the hook its way to big. Fix the bugs involved with the hooks as well. gtZenyatta Slightly reduce HP to .

8425795,0,t1_d5uj89g,Dota has over a hundred characters comparing a Dota balance patch to an Overwatch patch at the current state is pointless. Overwatch being young and having a much smaller cast of characters means balance should be way more achievableif they can get it to the point where every hero is played competitively even a small amount thats still better than where Dota  is after  years.If Overwatch had  characters I guarantee you patches would be larger than just  or  heroes at a time.You make it sound like IceFrog has no clue what hes doing and is just using patch size as a substitute for complexity but if you look at the things hes adding like the new items theyre mostly new mechanics. These changes takes time to digest just like with any other gameOverwatch patches are much smaller it seems and they still take weeks for the community to digest. I think at the point where people start discovering things in the Overwatch meta thats where this game really gets interestingotherwise its kinda sad to imagine a world where all  heroes are played but the meta is so rigid that everyone has a counter and it just comes down to switching heroes constantly throughout a match. At least in Dota the drafts are decisive Ive always worried that the meta in OW might get stale if hero counters were considered stronger than just good teamplay.,Competitiveoverwatch,d5urkyi,1,t5_34fcy

8430106,0,t3_4v1t32,This is kinda hard as they are difficult in different ways and some are easy to play but hard to master. Hardest at the top easier down.AnaIs there any doubt? she is one of those you can be really bad at and it shows. She needs aiming good positioning and a good awareness. She is almost useless in the hands of a bad player.Lucio Lucio is a tough one to put on the list. He is like a piano easy to play but hard to master. You dont have to be a good lucio to be effective. But his wall riding and offensive potential gives him a high skill cap just about anyone can do well with him but to master him is a whole different story. MercyHer play style isnt tough persay but how enemies react to her makes her difficult to play. You already have two shining wings to highlight you and your enemies want you dead. Awareness and positioning are key. A bad mercy gets killed a lot A good one is slippery and its hard to be slippery or at least it depends on your team. Mercy is the most team dependent one. ZenyattaBefore zenyattas buff he would be at the top. But now that he has a whopping  shields he is the most durable support healthwise. Lucio is more sturdy with his constant healing Really his only big weakness is his slow movement and kinda slow moving projectiles and his projectiles really do matter so youll need a good aim. A bad Zenyatta is bad at aiming a good one is a master at aiming and a force to reckon with. Kinda hard to play and good skill cap but he is one of those where no real big obstacles stand in his way. Really I would say Mercyzenlucio are pretty interchangeable in terms of difficulty depending on your strengths and situation. Symmetra My personal favoriteIts tough to classify sym as she is the most different than all the supports. Her play style is more positional and situational. Her combat style have the lowest skill cap with the exception of winston. So her real challenge is where she puts her sentries and teleports. Just because she is number five doesnt mean anyone can easily pick her up and do well. A bad Sym can really screw up a team with a badly placed teleporter. You need a different mindset playing sym different than the usual stay away from me Im valuable support mindset. Its more Oooh this is good spot for a sentry oh this is nice. ah perfect teleporter spot.So in short.Ana is difficult lucio mercy and zen are interchangeable symmetra is just different.,Competitiveoverwatch,d5vaym4,1,t5_34fcy

In the ZenyattaMcCree meta the Reinhardt shield is incredibly important for blocking out the discord orb and protecting your team Zenyatta and McCree are also low mobility and need to be protected. Dva can help with that by eating huge swathes of damage to preserve the shield. Zarya can protect teammates individually Winston can drop a shield over your team or the enemy team. Roadhog does none of that and increases the reliance on the shield especially considering how he melts against discord orb and how hes low mobility as well.  ,Competitiveoverwatch,d5wu4m4,3,t5_34fcy

8448730,0,t1_d5xil37,This is more from an FGC perspective so take it for what its worth. Whenever youre designing hybridutility characters you have to be really really careful about designing their skills since they can crowd out traditional archetypes by being so good at everything. I actually think its far more pernicious in Lucio then in Zen since a lot of the stuff that Lucio does is much more subtle  he is by FAR the best healer in the game in terms of raw HP healed he has the best survivability of any support has the best independent mobility of any support and is the only support that can buff multiple teammates with healing or movement. His supposed weaknesses are weak damage output and a poor ability to deal with burst damage on his teammates. In practice having a second support cancels out his inability to deal with burst damage and even though his damage is weak when you combine it with his mobility high rates of regeneration and pushback he has the strongest survivability of any support. None of these is as obviously powerful as Zens discord or Mercys Res but because theyre ALL part of his base kit hes a very low risk hero. Theres almost no situation in which Lucio is bad and a lot of the times hes better then all the other alternatives. The fact that hes used across the board regardless of the map or composition is our first clue that something is wrong. He doesnt need people to protect him like ZenMercy and he doesnt need to rely on team synergies to work. Theres a reason why he has the highest pick rate AND one of the highest win rates behind super specialists like Symmetra amp Torb. Mercy by contrast has one of the highest pick rates though this is dropping fast and one of the lowest win rates. The most obvious solution is to reduce his ability to either heal or speed boost  maybe increase the cooldown of amp it up reduce the radius of its effect tinker with the numbers or some combination of the three. The problem right now is you feel punished for NOT taking a Lucio which doesnt strike me as good design or balance. It might make sense to move him from being a primary healer to a utility healer like Zen that would give both Mercy amp Ana roles as the primary healer. Right now Lucio  Zen is pretty much enough sustain for whatever you need. If you reduce his ability to keep his team topped up then all of a sudden teams have to make a decision between running a really fragile high utility comp like LucioZen or something with a little more staying power  either focusing on damage with ZenMercy or Ana or aggressiveness with LucioMercy or Ana. This would also go a long way to bringing defense heroes back on the radar because they wont be instantly rushed down discorded and blown up. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d5xmmk4,14,t5_34fcy

I got into the point. Now what?  Oh zarya is fighting me  Ill defence matrix her!  Oh shit defence matrix does not work against beam Ill just go back the same way!!! I got in even if its longer  Oh hi enemy Rein sorry Im panicking and just need to get to my spawn. Not hurting you from behind be well. Just rewatch that part yourself its pretty bad. I doubt its D.Vaspecific. Its much better for the rest of the match but you still get disoriented here and there. This problems seems to be fixed by watching your own vods and taking notes of such situation and by pure experience i.e. time played while being conscious of your gameplay.You also like to shoot at people being veeery far away. At such ranges you do virtually zero damage okay you maybe do . Go to practice range find that stationary bot with distance markers and learn the range at which you become useless. This is the range you should use stuff other than M i.e. WASD EM Shift. This is very important and you seemingly spend a very sizable chunk of the match shooting at enemies so far away. This is bad and it kinda overshadows your other mistakes at least for me. EDIT rule of thumb if the enemy appears smaller in size than your crosshair and oftentimes even if they are equal  you are not doing damage to them. This is not only due to the shots spread  its actual damage falloff i.e. every single pellet does less damage the more it travels.Last thing  you are very conservative with your boosters. Dont be. They have even shorter cooldown than you think they have. In particular do use them to get to healthpacks real quick.Good luck!,Competitiveoverwatch,d5xwwlj,6,t5_34fcy

8497906,0,t3_4vyjvd,If her selfregen was constantly active but weaker if she also applied a damage reduction on whoever shes healing or maybe damage amping? That would be a nice twist and if she had a better method of escaping or getting enemies off of her shed probably do a lot better all around. They obviously cant afford to bump up her damage amp much since that would give Cree oneshot kills off of headshots and just pumping HPS isnt the fix she needs. Shes free food when shes alone shes free food when shes targeted thats what I see anyways her ult is too proactive... Shit waitWhat if her ult not only rezd the team but also fullhealed everyone that was alive as well as placed a damage ampdamage resistanceslightly heals on use? This way her ult could be used for both alive and dead players. As stated by someone else proactive plays are usually better than reactive and the more people dead around Mercy the riskier her ult is.

Zenyatta is always there so you have to deal with having discord on you literally everytime you take to the skies which means youre just dead if McCree or Widow says so  is more effective now too you simply dont have the escape options to get away if someone attacks you while youre discorded. Sure discord means pharah can do a lot of damage too but that same damage could just be done by a McCree or something else anyways so its kind of a moot point. D.va can dislodge you from high ground at any time and she can eat your rockets all day every day. Not only that but your ult is going to get eaten by her if shes anywhere close by when you use it. despite having a jetpack her horizontal mobility is fairly limited her concussion blast is the only thing she really has and its got a  second cool down or something like that.

Maybe they get upset early on and dont win much prize money. Maybe the two players TSM was willing to buy out to replace the TJOs would have been upgrades.

For the  of players who arent rank  having superior vertical movement makes you a harder target and statistically less likely to get hit. I see pros on streams who arent playing Genji or Pharah also jump up and down on every hero they play because of this theory. I watch my friend the Genji main fight D. Va in competitive and quick play many times. He always come out on top easily. Unless my friend is a vastly superior Genji and every single D.

People act like just because the basics of Lucio are easy to learn he is an easy hero to play. There are lots of subtleties to him and if you know how to build your ultimate correctly you can really swing fights in your favor.People act like you need to carry every game to win. At a certain point your teammates become competent enough so that your own individual play becomes the deciding factor of whether you advance or not. That means that trying to carry every game instead of playing the objective will get you nowhere. This remains true no matter what role you play. Playing Lucio well involves facilitating your teammates play so that your team performs very well. Lucio is an absolute monster on defense too and he is better at stalling the payload than most heroes. Ive singlehandedly won games because of my Lucio stalls. Overwatch isnt about who has the best KD ratio or who has the most eliminations. Its about who plays the objective the best. Lucio is an incredible hero in this regards and is always a solid pick.,Competitiveoverwatch,d6aukx5,2,t5_34fcy

For callouts I use four words  Hero Direction  Direction  Elevation.  Itll be something like Reaper right back floor or genji left on upper bridge.  Hero so the person listening knows if its their job to deal with him or not.  Left or Right first so they know which way to turn.  If theyre front just say front first.

8576421,0,t3_4x3dx8,I think rather than nerfing the damage amplifier they should change the way it works. I think once Zenyatta places his discord orb on someone he should not be able to switch his orb target until A. The person with orb on has died or B. The orbed person has left LOS for long enough that the orb disappears. I think this would be a good enough nerf because it requires players to be more selective on who they place discord on.,Competitiveoverwatch,d6dmwbv,1,t5_34fcy

8589586,1,t1_d6f7cls,So you are telling that a macro is modifying the inmemory values which the executable has to be loaded into to run the program?Also looking at it from an institutional perspective how do you enforce this as a rule? A macro by definition will simulate true user input as far as the program is aware. The only ways to determine if this input is genuine is by  A Showing footage of reported cheaters to a jury of our piers which while effective CSGO Overwatch program is muddled by false positives.  B Intrusive anticheat software which is watching for macro programs. C Tracking user input over time and deriving patterns from that input such as turning exactly  degrees in exactly . sec consistently. If even possible or practical this is extremely unlikely to ever be implemented considering that its purpose would be to stop a small percentage of the player base from using a so called cheat that while useful doesnt provide any actual benefit that a skilled player could not get.Since it is likely this cheat cannot be regulated wouldnt it be better for the community to share the macro allowing anyone to use it thereby making it a level playing ground? Not only that but the abuse of broken mechanics is likely to be fixed if it becomes a widespread problem.,Competitiveoverwatch,d6fad58,-3,t5_34fcy

8603417,0,t1_d6guhn7,I think you highly underestimate the amount of influence you have at lower SR on the variance in Overwatch. Overwatch has a lot of statistics that you can check. I as well dropped to rock bottom after my placement and started looking at my stats. Even characters I thought I did well on were barely above . The only character that stood out as positive was Reinhardt with slightly above . Ive started playing Reinhardt as much as I could and the past few weeks Ive moved him up to  winrate which means Im even winning more then  the past few weeks as theres a decent amount of games before that.So in poker terms at my current SR as Reinhardt Im pocket aces and the other team has   offsuit. The   offsuit can hold in a single game and somewhat unlikely but they can get a winstreak on a single play session but in the long term pocket aces is always going to win out. I dont consider myself a carry but I do enable my team to win quite often. I know this wont last forever as I get higher but for now it is working.Lets take another example its a low level game and it is KotH. Nobody has picked Lucio so now you have to decide what you want to play. I dont have the statistics to back it up nor do I want to subject myself to the research but I think we can agree that not having Lucio on KotH is a very bad thing. So now I can either pick whatever I want and be like Im great at Reinhardt I will carry with him and eventually come to the conclusion that hey guess what the other team has a Lucio got the highground advantage and my team cant even make it through the choke for the entire round. Or I can bring out Lucio and have a  chance of winning. Im sure at higher SR variance plays a bigger role but at low SR being the guy that does his job you will have a big impact.,Competitiveoverwatch,d6h0rxj,2,t5_34fcy

Cover your back and watch flank paths as a group and he can do absolutely nothing except poke with shurikens to stack his ultimate which is all he does in competitive because they know how to play as a team.And the reason McCrees range was nerfed wasnt because the range itself had no counterplay but because McCree overall had none he was good close range mid range and long range.,Competitiveoverwatch,d6ns14c,6,t5_34fcy

So if the premise is that there is a good Zarya on the enemy team and you use your little calculator head up there to think hmm what hero could I possibly play to make their Zarya less effective? You can play reaper but what if they have a lot of peel in addition of the Zarya good ones know how to peel with their M so you cant poke  get close too much. Not the best maybe? So ideally you want burst to bring that bad bitch down right? Hmm I wonder if this character who can take pot shots behind cover or Reinhardt shield and drop her with  shots at best would do well at keeping her on her toes especially since you have this nice little E ability to limit her poking too right? Works pretty well at least if you can bring your cursor to her slowly moving head from time to time.

8783641,0,t1_d720eq9,Im actually around your SR but Reaper was my first true main. Something that really helped me with Reaper is just consider that it is an option to play really close to your team from time to time almost like hes a front liner. Like still work the corner but pop out near your team then wraith back behind Reinhardts shield. Sometimes just the pressure your team exudes is enough to make you enough of a surprise to do work. Like obviously it shouldnt be a consistent thing but its a good tool to have in your belt. Alternating between a lot of different engagement strategies really just more than increasing my Kills per game increased my survivability and team fight success when I play as reaper.I use this a lot when theres a really good tracer on the enemy team. I dont even flank until the tracer is dead or showing signs shes scared of my potential presence. As a consequence shes usually zoned to shit because your damage is scarier than her damage. You probably notice what Im talking about when youre just slaughtering everything on a payload during overtime while everyone is forced to stay on the payload. Yeah they know youre there but they cant really do fuck all about it either provided its a semiequal fight. Ive always felt that is the core of a good reaper.

8824051,0,t1_d78hflv,Let me spell this out for you because clearly youre not a very bright guy if you have a teamfight and Dvas Meka is the last to go down than yes I will actually allow Z suite Dva to escape and return to her team in the hopes that they attack again before she has returned to Meka form. I know its tough because of your limited capacity but try and follow me here the worst case scenario is that they wait for Meka to regen passively which is longer than if Dva simply died but your best case scenario is a teamfight with one of the enemy teams tanks out of commission. The potential gain from letting Dva sole survive a team fight is great and there is no real downside other than a few percent off your ulti. Now I want you to really think hard on this ok little buddy wrack your brain and really think how the enemy team missing a tank after they just lost the previous team fight might be beneficial for you. I even included an example here of a high level player doing it during a scrim as you can see he allows Dva to escape the fight alive and just as I explained the enemy team re engages too soon without one of the tanks and is wiped out before that Dva can rejoin the fight with her newly selected hero.,Competitiveoverwatch,d78j269,1,t5_34fcy

Taking  tanks  healers could work unless they take a reapermccree. My team will sometimes take  tanks  dps  healers  if the time arises where they dont have a reaper and  is not working. Pro comps have also seen some play with  where they take a ana instead of a dpstank but you need your team to be well coordinated to do that. During my solo que play at high diamondlow master ive learned that  offers far less possible misplaycounters to your team. If uour team has  tanks get shredded by a reaper  supports? Destroyed by genjitracer. And your pharah point that is true she can dominate at lower levels but if you are at those lower levels you would need a good pharah to counteract a mediocre mccree as a mediocre mccree will destroy a mediocre pharah.

8859430,0,t1_d7ckuum,Getting frustrated and starting to identifying players faults and demanding them to switch should not be a resort at all. Again demanding anyone to do anything is going to fail especially when you get frustrated which is just another form of anger. Even if they do it they arent liking you and may get disconnected from the game and enjoyment. There are scenarios in the real world where one can be demanding or start to grab people to start to do things but thats not this scenario or this context. In my opinion it would be best to say Hey guys we can do this. Form up. Hey so can we get a switch we really need this or something like that. Group up and lets get this win guys. If you lose say live and learn hey so and so I do think maybe next time this particular role may help next time good luck rest of the way.. A teacher does not demand he or she sets the constructs for their students to learn and grow. Anyway best of luck.

Apart from that Overwatch has been out for almost a year for many players and if you strive to play the game professionally and put in the time thats a lot of commitment to becoming better rather than raw talent. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d7csr1w,10,t5_34fcy

8860461,0,t1_d7clkrk,Yes and no. You have to spend more time gathering all of the information yourself which takes more attention. If you crowdsource the effort everyone can keep everyone more informed for  the effort and more of your attention can be put on the killin.And if you have a Mercy? Chances are shes spending half the game looking behind her. If she keeps you informed for threats accurately thats an entire  degrees you dont have to account for. A lot more attention to be had which can be used for things like calling targets to focus which makes your DPS that much more effective.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7cwhuv,2,t5_34fcy

8863887,0,t1_d7d1ki9,We are caring too much about the feefees of a poorly performing player. In a competitive environment people want a way to identify and measure as best can be provided and denying a scoreboard does not remove the negative aspects of that  it only causes the flaming to be directed at the entire team and overall frustration to rise. A poorly performing player should not have his feelings spared at the expense of everyone having a better understanding where the weak points are.  If youre soldier with  damage in a  minute game I should be able to tell that and ignore you as a healer because youre obviously not worth my time. Instead without a scoreboard I have no idea how little youre doing unless I am watching you like a hawk.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7dbc69,0,t5_34fcy
8864452,0,t1_d7da6tw,Thats one side but even though your totals will be skewed your personal performance on a DPS character shouldnt change when compared with your current team.  That way if  people pick DPS and refuse to switch the team can then know which DPS is being the least useful and ask them to switch.At currently with nobody actually knowing who is being the best DPS on the team its always the TracerGenji that gets blamed.  Even when Im on fire  of the match get  elims if we lose the match playing Tracer its my fault we lost because I was playing a Tracer.

I rarely hear that happening in higher tier games. You what is gonna happen if you get the scoreboard  you want? People will start talking shit to healers and then LESS people will want to heal they will make other excuses like  well you only have more kills or damage because you bait everyoneThe biggest take away from this post is that the mass demographic of OW still dont understand that it is a team game and individual performance can only go so far. And to make sure that everyone knows you are good you want a scoreboard. What happens when you are not as good on paper as you think you are? If you pay attention at all to the game you can tell if the DPS is lacking by never seeing them on the kill feed or finding that you cant break in to a site. You shouldnt need a scoreboard to know where the weak points are.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7der9t,6,t5_34fcy

8867711,0,t3_51p8kg,He may make some good points but overall the video is a train wreck. Mercy getting POTG too much is a throwaway and literally has zero to do with the game. Blizz altered POTG algos and from a competitive point of view POTGs dont mean anything. It sounds like hes bitching that Mercy Res gets too many POTG and thus it should be nerfed. Yes thats not the point hes making but either make a tongue in cheek video or make a serious commentary about what role Res plays in the game. If you think Res is bullshit stop being passive aggressive about it and just say that Res is bullshit and Mercy hiding in the corner to press Q takes little to no skill. And if thats true there should be no functional difference between random Diamond Mercy amp Adam from C since her skill ceiling is so low.If you think it should be nerfed come out and say that it charges too fast or theres no risk to it and it should be nerfed. Dont say I dont want to nerf Mercy I just want her Res to be less effective. Thats a completely incoherent sentence. Look at the changes hes proposing  you can only res one or two people have it be a channel or they only have half health. I dont know about you but those sound a lot like nerfs to me. I think Scatter Arrow is bullshit but Im not quite sure what to do about it without hurting Hanzo. I dont go around saying I dont want to nerf Hanzo but I really think Scatter Arrow should be less effective. Then make a bunch of proposals like increasing its cooldown reducing its damage or removing it and pretend it isnt a nerf. You need to make the argument that Mercys Kit is like McCrees Kit  McCrees kit is so damn good that even if his ult is nerfed you still want McCree. Does Mercy really fit that role? Id argue that no it doesnt  the common complaint about Mercy is that her kit sucks and shes a Res bot. We saw that a  increase in her ult charge basically killed her off in the meta. McCrees Ult nerf is basically as bad  he probably gets it half as often with the changes but hes not going anywhere. Is there evidence that Mercy is currently at a  pick rate in this meta? I dont think so. If Stylosa really thinks so he needs to provide an argument for it other then Her solo healing is really good and is strong enough to make her a pick right now well that kind of requires some extraordinary proof. To say that reducing the effectiveness of her Res isnt a nerf while providing snark instead of actual evidence isnt an argument. Its pandering for views. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d7drw3j,10,t5_34fcy

8884590,0,t3_51xlxg,The best tip I can give you is to first realize what role you are good at. Then you grind all heroes and get fucking great at them. For example if your aim isnt the best try the tank role. Then you start playing Roadhog. Lose a fuckton until you get him. Like  games atleast until you are one with the hook. After that tackle the big boy Zarya. Play her for  games and get good at her. Watch pro players streams cocco from envy teaches a great Zarya.What Im trying to say is that there is no shortcut. You gotta bite the sour apple and grind new and difficult heroes until you get them. Thats improvement. Reaching rank  on a lucky streak playing your same old hero roster is not improvement.And yeah it fucking sucks to drop ranks when trying out new heroes.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7fsw83,1,t5_34fcy

8898795,0,t1_d7hfa7d,The game calculates the chance of you winning by taking into account the rating of all players not the roles youre playing. To me it seems more like his friend is gaining more because theres a difference in rating. For example if his friend was  and he was  while the team average was  his friend would gain more because hes in harder matches while he would gain less because its seen as easier for him. Also I do believe supports gain fewer points based on comments Ive seen around here.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7hiacd,2,t5_34fcy

If the zen doesnt kill the genji that wouldve been pretty bad and the only way he dies to the tracer is if he stays on high ground after he dropped he was completely safe. This wasnt even a moderately impressive play it was at the end of a teamfight that the zenyattas team had already won and he just helped finish off  flankers. Youre blowing things absurdly out of proportion.Plus I cant believe youre complaining that theyre not focusing on zen enough they had the camera on him while genji was ulting on cart they only switch away after zen kills the genji and then you see his entire team focusing the tracer who is no longer even shooting at zen honestly Im astonished how much you managed to skew whats happening in this clip.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7hopyw,11,t5_34fcy

Certain times I understood ite.g. LW Red had a dive comp for their first round of attack but had Pine on McCree instead of Tracer but other times he completely lost mee.g. why TSM had bad team comp for the streets phase why Roadhog was a poor pick for their second round of defense and a few more.I feel like Im at the point where my mechanical skill is decent enough to win at my current level of play but my goal for this season was master. The few master ranked players I have run into have always seemed to be in the right place at the right time and always seem to make switches that shift the tides of the game. I know they are at least somewhat better at the game than I am mechanically but they absolutely blow me out of the water when it comes to understanding the game. I want to close that gap as much as possible and I feel like understanding how to choose heroes that synergize well with my team and how to counter pick heroes are two skills that I am severly lacking. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d7iqzh8,3,t5_34fcy

Hell perhaps he fucked up as well that can happen. But if you look at his interviews and recent communications the whole Riot debacle was extremely well handled on his side he seems like a very level headed guy who had to quickly learn a ton about how to manage a company. In that sense I believe he quickly became one of the most reliable team owners out there.

Go to the gym go watch a movie go do something that gets your mind off of it.As far as climbing back up dont be discouraged. At this level just pick the hero who you are most comfortable with and just frag out. Just go for some kills. People at this level wont punish you as hard for your mistakes. If youre a support main play an offsupport. Play Ana or Zen and then you can be apart of the fight and the heals. If you have a buddy who can play a half decent bastion you can do what I used to do with some of my frineds in comp and went on a  game win streak with it. You run ana and bastion. Your goal as ana is to keep bastion alive. Heal other people every now and then but you are essentially pocketing him. Then you combine your ults and let him just go ham. The idea is that you abuse the fact that both of those heroes can build ult very fast and when combined you get one incredibly powerful force. Its some good fun and can straight up just steam roll defenses but it stops working at a certain point. Hope everything goes well for you and remember at the end of the day its just a game.

9010073,1,t3_53o1pu,At this point Im neither convinced whether or not its hitscanprojectile. I went to do further testing and could replicate a lot of times where the Hook will stun a Mei in Cryo Freeze and Genji mid Deflect and thats without refunding their cooldowns so the server has acknowledged that they used their abilities and confirms it wasnt an effect of lag compensation. However I could never replicate killing GenjiMei through their abilities with anything else other than Hook. Leads me to think that the Hook for some reason has a few ticks where it will override defensive skills. Which is really really confusing xx Or like Hook is applied over a few tick before and after the stun probably where itll still let the defender do whatever but itll ignore whatever skills used and still stun through it. Like can it just be a one tick thing please? gtgt If it Hooks it hooks dont give the defender any window to do anything if its just going to be bypassed anyway. This is purely conjecture though for now based on how frequent simultaneous events can occur compared to everything else which are definitely rarer. You dont see McCrees killing each other as frequently if ever. And never had a Pharah kill Cryo Freeze Mei so its not a projectile thing either. Yet its so easy to replicate hooking through defensive abilities. Yea thanks for working on this btw. Regardless of hitscanprojectile which atm I dont have a firm opinion on lol hook is a really weird skill with awkward and unexpected interactions.

9016942,0,t1_d7vhlje,Ive seen it happen so many times too.Well have a Junkrat he sits on or near the point and fires grenades into the main choke indiscriminately. A lot of the time they just hit Rein shield. Other times they end up killing someone who was out of position. Sometimes D.VA eats them up or the nades charge up Zarya. Sometimes not enough of them hit anything useful and they just charge up the enemy support ults because the supports are healing tons of chip damage. While everyone else is running around trying to deal with various threats Junkrat is positioned safely away from everything while his team gets destroyed. Because of his damage on the choke point and the fact that hes the last one alive he has  gold medals  elims  objective kills k damage  of objective time but all he did was cause his team to get wiped by various ults because he was actually a detriment to his team and played selfishly. Im not saying Junkrat is a bad character in all situations or that hes a bad character overall but its really easy to get  gold medals on him and not actually do anything for your team. I suspect hes an attractive pick to less skilled players who think medals are equally important to winning the game and dont see the big picture when it comes to creating a team comp. I know I used to pick him a lot because I could do k damage in a medium length match and felt like that was a major contribution.Sometimes the enemy team doesnt have something that can ignore Junkrat or their team comp is low mobility and overly dependent on Reins shield for pushing. Junkrat is amazing in those cases. Other times though? You should look at switching because your gold medal in damage doesnt mean anything other than youre hitting shields in a choke point.,Competitiveoverwatch,d7vp2f6,1,t5_34fcy

9018094,1,t1_d7vryce,Im very sad about posts like this. Ana didnt receive a buff at all since her initial one and for MONTHS since then she was listed as the worst healer until people figured out the  comp. Now shes OP and needs a nerf. Let me tell ya something Her healing still needs to be aimed Hitting the clutchheal feels amazing but its also insanely hard to do since your own team AND the enemyteam can bodyblock your shots.  Low mobility makes this even harder. Low radius on the granade makes it necessary to aim extremely well  SleepDart is very hard to hit reliably.Her ult is the ONLY thing that people list which makes her OP funny enough just  weeks ago she was the worst supporter because of her ult which didnt cancel any DPS ults like the other supporters did. Her pickrate consulting the current metareport is still CTier. Same level as Mercy and WAY lower than Lucio and Zenyatta. Wanna hear whats gonna happen if they nerf this CTier Hero in the one niche that she has? Shes not gonna be viable anymore. Plain and simple. Im probably gonna get downvoted for this because the people who scream shes OP the people who said shes not viable just a few weeks ago the FOTM guys so to speak dont like to hear this. People are gonna pick Zen over her Lucio Mercy whatever. She will get shoved in a box with the current Widowmaker and Soldier and never see the light of day again. SURE super capable people will still be able to utilize her like Kephrii still manages to be an amazing Widow...but lets not kid ourselves. Ana is not going to survive that nerf. People want the nerf because they dont like the way her strengths are utilized in the meta...and I understand that. I get that not shooting because it feeds the enemyAna ult charge is boring for most FPSPlayers. Being someone who plays an FPS competitively for the first time I personally dont mind it since it promotes teamplay tactical gameplay and decisionmaking over aimtraining...but I know im in the minority here. Thats fine I guess. Just please dont take the ONE healer thats actually a unique and skilldependant supporter away just because your team hasnt learned how to counter her yet. At this point I hope she receives a nonsensebuff like Lucio did...because hes still at  pickrate but at the same time people stopped complaining about him being OP instantly. So the only way to change her and keep her viable at the same time is to completely rework her ult. I know thats not gonna happen tho sadly. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d7vu19c,8,t5_34fcy

9023165,0,t3_53q6sk,I think this is why people hate Hanzo many people think he is a sniper like widowmaker.  So they complain like its a widow. In all honesty Hanzo is closer to a mccree than a widow he just has less options close range and more options long range. For example Flashbang is usually a one shot kill close. So is scattershot although less consistent. Good hanzos will be behind their rein shield with the team scatter shotting flankers and getting omg bullshit picks on your healers. Bad hanzos will be in the rafters shooting at people miles away hoping to hit. At a certain range Hanzo BECOMES reliable. That is why you play him closer to your team.I am  rank  last season and in my games if we have a Hanzo spammer he is usually pretty insane because hey he made it to my rank playing that hero while I filled. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d7wfyth,1,t5_34fcy

This is because you want to capitalize on the advantage you just gained and attempt to eliminate a few other players before the med respawns.I dont think Overwatch should remove tanks from the game obviously.  Limiting how many you can put on one team might be a good idea though.  The more tanks a team has the less nonultimate damage affects them.

Widows ultimate is functionally different from other ultimates. Most heroes have ultimates that the enemy actively needs to avoid during a fight while Widows is usually most effective when it allows her to pick a target before the fight even begins. With the global call out however most teams will just wait it out.Additionally it seems like her ultimate is generally weaker in tournament play as players are less often caught out of position and it only marginally helps you win a team fight.,Competitiveoverwatch,d840h0w,-4,t5_34fcy

Going in on the back lines of a team when they havent committed to a fight with yours means they will all just turn around and kill you. You probably have experienced flanking in both scenarios and havent made the conscious realization of why one attempt worked and one didnt.

Ive always been in good health exercise quite a bit and eat relatively healthy. After about age  I always had some level of soreness due to heavy use.About  years ago it got so bad I could barely do my job it didnt seem to have a whole lot of rhyme or reason for flare ups. I went to multiple highly respected doctors and got nothing useful recommended. At times it got so bad I could barely type.The solution was insanely easy. Massage. I found some random youtube video that just talked about massage for typists. Relief was literally immediate. Within a day or two I could game  type to my hearts content and about a week in I was at maybe  discomfort with heavy use. Essentially I just massaged all the muscles in the arm to release the tension.Ive refined my explanation a bit since then I believe the core cause is inflammation. Inflammation is caused byDiet high in sugar refined carbs and polyunsaturated fats PUFA commonly found any processed food in the form of canola vegetable and any heavily modified food oilTension build up over time never being releasedLack of recovery primarily sleep and good foodMy belief is that diet is the core cause I can literally feel the same muscle issues returning after an indulgent day or two which can be exacerbated by the lack of recovery and failure to release the muscle tension.

Situational awareness is pretty key here. You should know where the winston and genji are and if they are planning to dive you. Youll probably want to be near your team if that happens instead of out in the open in a potshotting area.Theoretically your team is supposed to immediately collapse and kill the winston in . seconds and what typically happens is you make a trade for like  of your supports for their winston then you brawl it out. In reality whats probably gonna happen is the winston is gonna dive you and everyone is going to pick a different priority target because le xd matchmaking. If you get dove at say  hanzo ult and die check your zarya ult status. If shes at a low  you should probably just swap off because they will continue to do that.

9169644,0,t3_4topv3,When youre really low in ranking like i am right now most teams either need someone who can deal damage or a tank.  I generally notice that my damage dealers arent doing their job probably because most new players pick attack heroes andor dont get the nuances of tank and support classes.  When we are killing the other team but still not capturing objectives its generally because the tank isnt being aggressive enough or were being held up by a turretbastion.  Thats when i switch to an offtank like winston or dva to eliminate the turret and press the objective.  If nobody is picking support and you need a healer I generally go for mercy.  Lots of times the skill distribution on the team is uneven so then I find the best player on the team and sit in his pocket giving damage boost from around a corner or healing as needed.  If skill is evenly distributed I play a more versatile support character like Lucio or if you need a little more offensive support I go Zenyatta.  My general strategy for what its worthpick a damage dealer straight away then wait a few seconds to see what others pick.generally i pick soldier or pharah on offense junkrat on defensechange to fill in the gaps for balance.  if no tanks go roadhog or zaryaif no healers go mercy lucio zenyatta,Competitiveoverwatch,d8ebk1m,2,t5_34fcy

9240687,0,t3_56x1cf,It was very good and effort was clearly put into it. It was clear you had already watched the games  and analyzed the clips you showed. Its also very lean and concise. Compared to some other VoD reviewers who just wing it and ramble on forever about nothing yours is already a step above. But lets talk improvement. You arent doing the review live and you make use of edits and cuts to jump between clips. You should embrace this further however and divide each clip into multiple takes. For example if you talk about one clip for  minutes talk for about  minute until you hit a good place to pause and stop. Do this multiple times for the same  seconds until you get a take you like then move on to the next minute of the clip. It is much easier faster and will sound better than trying to get one good giant  minute clip. . you pull out the important clips which is good but you go a bit overboard. You spend a lot of time paused and my philosophy when doing VoD reviews is to stay paused for as little time as possible and only do it when necessary. You spend a lot of time paused setting the scene for each fight. Instead of being paused just as the fight starts I suggest you dial back the VoD about  seconds when people were respawning and getting in position to push. This way as one team is moving up and starting to set up you can explain the scene much more naturally. It is also much less jarring for the viewer than to be thrust suddenly into the heat of a fight. So basically say the exact same thing and take the exact same amount of time at the beginning but instead of starting at a paused screen the viewer can be watching the players get into position. . You go a bit overboard on names at times. A lot of people dont know names saying valutaja comes up and then Unfixed jumps over but he gets healed by Morte while Onigod uses his ult is super confusing and will result in  of your viewers having to pause to look up and figure out who those players are. I suggest lightly sprinkling in the names talk mostly in terms of heroes while adding in names for flavor kind of like this. Valutaja on Tracer comes up and then their Genji jumps over but he gets healed by Mortes Ana dart while Zarya uses his ult. Great ult by Onigod there on the Zarya. Even that is probably excessive naming but you can see how the names are incorporated with the heroes and you cant always say everyones name all the time and still have it sound good. . Again stay paused for as little time as possible. Adjust your clip length if possible but you shouldnt be pausing just to have more time to talk. Limit yourself to the length of the clip and only pause to point something out specifically that the freezeframe can emphasize. If you use the pause as a tool rather than a time extender for your speech it will be much more engaging. It is hard to boil your analysis down but I think the key to great media any media not just VoD reviews is concise and clear sentences. If person A and person B both say the same thing then the person who said it in less words wins in my book. Even if you do have more to add you have to weight time spent versus value added. Just try to cut your sentences down to as little as possible and over time you will find it easier and easier to speak concisely. You arent nearly as bad as most but there is a big margin for improvement. Anyway now that Ive thoroughly roasted you Ill remind you that I did like it and found the review to be high quality compared to other reviews posted on youtube and this sub.

9307171,0,t3_57xgjf,Great to see these guys doing a show for Overwatch itll give me more reason to actually watch competitive. If you arent familiarright Christopher MonteCristo Mykles Most knowledgeable League of Legends analystcaster Famous for specific knowledge of the Korean scene in any eSport Owner of Renegades org Forced to sell LoL team Pundit for eSports scenes typically LoL concerning playerteam rights and payWhy is he into Overwatch? Monte is always aiming for longevity and believes it is silly to be exclusive to one game just for it to die and you have no career path. Overwatch has built a considerable following and playerbase and looks to be one of the fastest growing eSports if a few kinks get worked out. In League of Legends he has become somewhat of a villain to the developer of the game because he has called them on a few points of bullshit. LoL devs pay a very low caster rate below esports average and he was in business with someone Riot did not like because of strictly accusations no proof has ever been produced or corroborated. In the end you could say LoL left him with a bitter taste in his mouth but he has become somewhat of a fan favorite despite favoring the Koreans NA fans hate that. left Duncan Thorin Shields dubbed the eSports Historian  Most knowledgeable Counter Strike analyst Popular pundit in CS and LoL  Known for savage jokes  Famous for being hated and loved by the community simultaneously Probably the most experienced eSport figure in history Somewhat hated in the LoL community for being honest with jokes of course Not afraid and somewhat excels in having an unpopular opinion with good reasoningWhy is he into Overwatch? Thorin is known for following and somewhat worshiping legendary players. That said he is extremely grounded and will not shy away from letting you know their play is slipping. He is always looking into the biggest eSports but most importantly what interests him. I would speculate he is into Overwatch partly because its an FPS although simplified compared to some other games and partly because like Monte he looks to diversify. He isnt the kind of guy that will ride and die with a game. Its difficult to limit him to a single paragraph but to expand on earlier bulletpoints about him being loved and hated hes complicated. I hated Thorin personally for a while but after watching more videos of him expanding his thoughts I realized we think very similarly. He is reviled in some ways for jokes he makes that people take very seriously and use hyperbole to pretend that hes a racist. He made comments about an event in Poland being big because there is fuck all else to do in Poland in general implying Poland is a shit country if you ask poles they will tell you its somewhat grim but they are still proud. The main controversy here is that he was just about to be on the analyst desk for an event in Poland so it seemed a bit awkward and definitely wasnt a nice thing to say. Another controversy is that he compared the owner of TSM to the lead gorilla in Planet of the Apes comparing his crazed mentality to the character the side joke was that he was ugly like a gorilla. People implied this was him saying racist comments because of TSM owners race but it was certainly a stretch in my opinion. TLDR he is a controversial figure and you have to realize he is similar to a standup comic take it seriously and youll be angry and look stupid. Critical thinking and expanding thoughts is the most important thing to him think deeply about something and then think about it from the opposite viewpoint and then a rd viewpoint that is how Thorin thinks.Both of them are well known for critical thinking controversial statements and opinions and most importantly top tier entertainment. They will make many people mad they will make many people laugh but in general they are well respected and do their research to a tee. You can bet that theyll stick around and be more prominent as the scene grows but do not mistake it for a cashgrab they both only get invested in things they feel are worthy of their time. LoL is still the biggest esport and CSGO is clearly the second they could both stick just to their current games but find value in Overwatch despite the career risk they are taking by making content for Overwatch.,Competitiveoverwatch,d8vr1pp,111,t5_34fcy

You usually want to  shot a hp hero before going to point. I usually select my targets in this order  McCree Mercy Ana Zenyatta. I will avoid trying to fight a Mei or Reaper as that will draw out the fight and you want to try and get a pick before the rest of the team notices you are flanking. If Im being pocketed I will go for a double kill. Once you get a pick tell everyone to rush in. If the enemy team is running Sym I will also make sure to clear turrets. I find Pharah works well up until the last point.Defense I usually go McCree.

Ana herself however is too strong which is why she is in every match. Her basic kit is insane. You can straight up outheal a lot of damage applied to whatever you are targeting which in itself shouldnt exist. If Im mccree and I hit every single shot on a zarya I expect her health to at least go down a little but with ana around it doesnt even move. Her grenade in combination with zarya ult wipes a team which is ridiculous and flankers such as tracer and genji cant even properly v a good ana because she is just going to throw a noskillneeded aoe to her feet which gets her back to full and nearly kills the genjitracer. Oh hey and she is better at taking downduelling a phara than mccree or soldier. Have I mentioned her sleepdart yet? The best nonult ability in the game and its not even close.

9318534,0,t3_583a30,I feel that one or two points would be a good addition to this guide. Things like Dont let your shield break all the way if you can help it so you dont lose to Earthshatter. Its ok to take down your shield so it doesnt get too low and it can allow you to land a single meleefire strike and help your healers gain ult charge. Sometimes taking down your barrier can also bait out the EarthshatterThe other one would be that there is no problem doing the same thing as the enemy Rein since it just results in a stalemate. Staring down at each other with shields up or charging each other at the same time results in no changes for either side unless your team can follow up on that stalemate and perform better. Oh and its almost always worth it to charge a nanod Rein off a cliff if you can. Earthshattering is a cleaner answer but its better to save your team and deny the enemy Rein the ult charge than to charge him and summarily die to being deep in enemy lines.,Competitiveoverwatch,d8x6xjb,4,t5_34fcy

One other question that I havent been able to tell one way or the other due to how much is going on does the hammer ignore another Reins shield or just if you are close enough?

9364988,0,t1_d93099z,Pharah rockets are crazy reliable if youre good with her.  I dont know if youve ever played TF but the Soldiers rockets there are actually even slower and those are seen as completely usable even in a game with higher movement speeds and far more aircontrol.The main difference between rockets and arrows is that rockets explode in an AoE and have knockback.  What this ends up meaning is If you aim at the ground and hit anywhere close to your target you still deal great damage. Once you deal the first bit of damage youve knocked the target back which allows you to predict their movement more accurately and line up the next shot.Pharahs issue has never been her weapon.  Her weapon is great.  What she really needs is something to allow her to get out of the air faster. or to have additional maneuverability while in the air.,Competitiveoverwatch,d932v6u,20,t5_34fcy

That being said I think Reaper can still do his job even when hes against a good pharah since you run him mostly to break tanks and to beyblade large groups. Hes also a lot better than junkrat at surviving the pressure that comes in from high ground heroes like Pharah and Widow due to wraithform. Lastly my experience is that most people play reaper because hes good and when hes no longer good they are happy to switch off him. This is not my experience with most Junkrat players.I dont think Junkrat does his job well against good pharahwidowwhatever players.

By doing so S can laser people at a longer range.  And the damage boost will allow him to be a bit scarier against Pharah.Close range S should be reserved for odd situations of opportunity where its possible to burst down a sniper or a healer who wandered offposition with a wellplaced helix rocket.

9404632,0,t1_d97vqgm,gtBut she isnt?She is  overpowered.All of your points are questionable as well.gtIf you compare a Dota hero to a LoL hero Dota heroes are overpowered in a lot of aspects but every healer is busted in this game. Not really sure what this is trying to prove? What  games was I comparing? Every support isnt busted. gtZen has more dueling potential and burst damage.Dueling potential? Hes got it provided hes landing frequent headshots. If Anas landing shots as well though its not even a contest since sleep dart is a free kill. Burst damage? Eh not really unless youre spamming RMB I suppose or getting lucky with discorded double headshots. But only looking at headshots is unreasonable as even professional players dont usually average more than  of their shots as headshots... and thats on McCree. Zenyatta? Its more in the  range. Average Ana accuracy is much much higher than that and she doesnt have to worry about missing headshots or timing RMB volleys to determine her burst. gt Lucio has more self healing Lucio has more utility with speed boost.If youre amping healing on lucio to self heal ur doin it wrong. Anas nade at feet for  burst healing is also better than lucios .sec healing. The difference is that nading feet while not ideal doesnt totally remove the biggest reason people play Ana. Amping healing for self heals on lucio does. Also Speed boost is the only utility Lucio has period aside from Ult but he cant heal while hes doing it. While yes speed boost is incredible important that is the only utility it provides. Anas utility is Switching from burst healing to damage every other shot switching from ludicrous burst you can no longer die healing to you can no longer heal so now you die damage on the fly and finally hey how about a free killult counterengage counterengage enablerpickprevention that is sleep dart utility. gtAnas dps isnt even higher than mercy pistol body shots.On a stationary target? Sure. Against anything with a brain? Hell no. I dont even know what to say. If Mercy lands shots with  accuracy then I have  suggestions  stop playing mercy and play Widowmaker instead You are not healing nor can you heal until you switch back to staff and dash to your target vs Ana who simply adjusts her aim and shoots at an ally twice from the same position. Healing more I might add.gtSure Mercy is on the weaker side but even she sees proplay by one of the best teams in the world.Mercy is by FAR the weakest support in this game. She sees pro play exclusively with PharahMercy which in and of itself is ironically punished hard by Ana. Also PharahMercy has not been seeing a lot of success lately anyway.gtYou could even argue that if LucioGenjiTracerWinston dive comp wasnt nerfed she wouldnt be played more than Zen even if Zen was in his current state because she is to unreliable in a super fast meta.You could even argue that if  of these  heroes were still overpowered then these  total heroes might make her less usedI mean sure if were talking about comps and heroes that have since been nerfed you could even argue that if McCree still had no damage fall off then Reaper wouldnt be used as much and therefore there might not be as big a reason to use Ana as there is now.,Competitiveoverwatch,d983qmk,5,t5_34fcy

Even without the Lucio Winston is the easiest sleep target ever and Ana STILL has  effective HP which takes a long ass time for a Winston to kill giving her even more time to line up a good sleep.For a support to be THAT good against antisupports is really bad for the game and imo its the main reason shes broken.

I apologize ahead of time if this is a book... gt Did you guys accumulate your competitive gaming knowledge as players or as observers in present or past games?Before Overwatch I have an extensive background in video games. Ive played every FPS under the sun but always favored the more tactical FPS games. I played the Rainbow  and Team Fortress  competitively and coached both as well. Ive also played a ton of other genres but there are far too many to list. Outside of the game I also come from a sports background where I both played and coached baseball for several years. Its weird to me that some people think that Sports and Video Games are different types of people but this is called an eSport for a reason! There are so many similarities I see from my experience in coaching a physical sport and coaching Overwatch Id say that my experience there is invaluable. Not necessarily from a tactical side of things but from a coachplayer relationship and helping them handle different obstacles limiting them. In Overwatch I was a player before I was a coach and logged in hundreds of hours in closed Beta on a couple teams as a Flex that competed in several of the early Gosu Tournaments. I truly believe that being able to play in Closed Beta for months before most others could gave me and others that did a sizable advantage in game knowledge and experience for a good while after the game was officially released. After seeing the problems on my own team at the time as well as many other teams I looked at I recognized the importance of how valuable it is to have someone that could look over games engagements and scrims and determine WHY you lose fights. I became a coach to help teams figure out the why and how and only have to focus on the execution. Overwatch is an extremely fastpaced game with a ton of things going on at the same time resulting in the fact that a lot of the time the players arent even sure what exactly went wrong due to limited vision and information from their perspective. This is why youll often see Casters have such a hard time casting games without missing important things. Its not really their fault theyre often locked into a st person POV usually a DPS and dont get to see a lot of whats going on outside of their vision trying to make sense of what happened on the fly. I think the best way to fix that is to have another casteranalyst watching in rd person all the time able to see everything and commenting on what the casters miss. Im not sure but I think GosuGamers do this because Hex has often comments on things that happen outside of the spectators camera which gives great insight to the viewers and ZP who couldnt have seen it from his perspective that would have otherwise missed it. These are just a few things I notice since after becoming a coach since I spend a lot more time watching the game than playing the game now. Other than every single scrim I make sure to watch every tournament I can NA EU KR whatever. As a coach you are always learning something new in this game. This is not an understatement. You also should challenge everytihng you thought you knew before because things change especially with huge balance patches like the one incoming soon. Its really a lot of fun for me and keeps the game fresh!gt Is there a particular calling to wanting to coach overwatch?When I saw the animated trailer for Overwatch at Blizzcon last year I honestly thought it was a pretty interesting looking movie. However once it was revealed to be a game and what type of game it was I knew it was going to be my new favorite pastime. Ive always enjoyed Video Games since I was a little kid and wanted to make a living doing it somehow. Thats no easy task but I believe its more important to pursue something you love doing than simply to do something that matches your degree or to do what most people do. I studied hard on the game before it came out as it went through its Beta phases and through every patch change. As I mentioned before I originally wanted to become a player but realized that everything I wanted to do on the team was too much for a player to handle especially when most of us still had jobsschoolmore important things to take care of. Obviously Dignitas wasnt the first Overwatch team I coached and I was surprised at how much of an impact pointing out a playerteams mistakes made into them improving and fixing things. Its even a more drastic improvement than when I coached baseball I have a theory as to why but Ill keep it short for now. I really wanted to see how far I could take what Ive learned from this game and push it as far as I could so thats when I became the coach of Creation Now Dignitas. Its been a wild ride and honestly its just beginning. Theres a lot of things in store soon that I cant talk about but lets just say Im really excited for the future and conflicted at who to root for between Bromas and Linkzr in the upcoming SpainFinland World Cup match!gt Most importantly do you think the overwatch coaching scene is being limited in any fashion by the present state of the game?Partly yes. As many other coaches have pointed out were wearing many hats at the moment. I dont necessarily mind this and have adjusted to it but I can definitely see how it could take away from our focus on some things at times. For example during scrims were an observer analyst listening to the team and communicating with the team all at the same time. Then we often go look at the vod afterwards and make sure we didnt miss anything while sometimes the vod isnt always clear because you didnt have the right angle didnt have rd person at perspective when it would have been handy or didnt have st person perspective when you needed to know a players POV. A replay system for the game would help us tremendously. gt What is your favorite thing about the game and the most hated thing about it?Favorite thing about the game? WAY too many to list. The passionate and knowledgeable community is one of my favorite things by far and I consider a games community to be part of any game. The care Blizzard goes into balancing and tuning the game is really great as well. From my perspective Ive come to really appreciate how difficult it is to balance this game when youre not sure if something is too powerful or simply not handled optimally and if you go too far with a slight tweak it could make a character go from UP to OP or stay UP. I really enjoy being one of a select few to be in charge of figuring out how to optimally use all of the ever changing tools at a teams disposal on every point of every map. Finally and this probably trumps everything else the players. Being in the trenches with some amazing people doing whatever I can to help them through both the good and bad times. Every win and every loss being amazing highs and lows is no different than the highest level of any other sport. Ive got a ton of respect for every player because I now know exactly what they go through from multiple perspectives.My most hated thing? This is the toughest question of all for me. Lack of a replay system sucks and the spectator tools are slowly getting better but Ive learned to adjust to what we have. Sometimes there are heroes too locked in to the meta and its difficult to really move away from them and maintain an optimal setup. Blizzard does its best to fix this but its not always easy without completely changing how a hero works or overnerfing them to where theyre under powered. That said it doesnt stop me from being creative and trying all sorts of things in scrims. ,Competitiveoverwatch,d9lq2ky,2,t5_34fcy

Unless ive watched it wrong?  They should have sub leagues in these countriescities to get the best team from these country. For Example ESL runs a UK Prem. Winner of that wins the top spot for the UK. Doing this for all the countries you should then hold a play off tournament to get the top  teams. Then those teams Represent EU. Then in the next season you relegate  teams down to the playoffs where they play the top teams from the countries for those  spots. Something along those lines.

9523939,0,t1_d9n047c,Yeah not a hard counter of course but a strong soft counter in the same way a hook or flashbang forces squishy heroes to play around them. Simply by virtue of having a Sombra a Zarya will need to use the self shield more conservatively which leads to less charge and therefore less damage. It is especially menacing given Sombras stealth and movement capabilities A hog for instance you can more often reactively play around that create the nigh constant uncertainty of whether shell be nearby waiting for the shield to be used. Of course the same will be true for ults that are easily shut down by her so its likely teams will prioritize picking her off first and holding back from committing insofar as thats possible. I wonder if Hanzo will be a more popular pick to counter her considering Sonic Arrow is one of the few tools available for revealing her and the need for burst damage to secure the kill given the two low cooldown movement abilities as well as her not needing to be close enough to be flashbanged. But yeah given how ubiquitous Zarya is it will be interesting to have a potent counterpick.,Competitiveoverwatch,d9n0zoz,3,t5_34fcy

In no world is Sombra ever going to melt through a Reinhardt in seconds. Even with Reinhardts shield down unless shes getting  headshots Reinhardt will kill her unless she Translocates out.Did you watch any of the video I linked? Stylosa isnt even very good and it took about  bullets from midrange to get a Reinhardt to less than half HP.

9530797,0,t3_5bbxl9,I feel like a lot of people really just arent getting why korea did so well in the cup. When it comes down to it korea plays a different overwatch than the western scene is used to. It was really noticeable in the russia match I think. One of the biggest things I noticed about their gameplay is the different level of use of trading and regrouping. It is very visible on their offence they let a dive dps or miro engage on the front in an unadvantageous position with a high chance of going down. While this is happening they have most of the team play conservatively and wait. Often the player goes down and the defense thinks its over with a pick like that and begins to reposition. At this point korea moves in a scattered advance and begins to pounce on the team after the engage or dive low targets. They dont care that they are down a man because they have the confidence to drag out the fight until the close spawn point brings them back to full strength. The key thing is that korea stands around regrouping ALOT less. They come in with unexpected plans constantly and the standardized western meta is a great match against this type of play because everyone is used to the flow of matches right now. pick regroup push repeat. The cup was easy prey for this type of play because the new teams will have an extremely hard time adjusting and flexing.I think the US gave SK the best match in part because Seagul and gods already played lunatic and actually played with them. Seagul was hanging out playing comp with half of lunatic for a couple hours. I think they must have gotten a better read on them than the other teams who were more mechanically strong.,Competitiveoverwatch,d9nvdg1,18,t5_34fcy

Where in Dota and CS they balance based on whats OP in the pro scene because the strats they use are the most imbalanced because they pros will take any advantage they can to win bc they take it the most seriously.I prefer that design philosophy over the Riot model of buffing and nerfing champions based on solo queue performance at all levels. Because what works against shitters is often not actually that strong and it ruins that champion or strat for midhigh level players.But thats my view on it of course. I especially feel that way for games the dev is clearly pushing as an esportcompetitive game because it makes the esportcompetitive experience better.,Competitiveoverwatch,d9srp3u,2,t5_34fcy

It is absurdly strong and you will most definitely kill them. If you hang out at the pillars just charge over the gap to the point. Im pretty sure you can make it by just charging over.If they have a pharaoh still play the point and just constantly stay in front of her or get under some cover if you can.

9604808,0,t1_d9vm8hi,Its hard to measure obviously but support heroes are the most impactful on the game overall but you get the least out of them for your skill excluding zenana even then youll get more out of a dps or zaryahog.Support heroes simply have lower skill floors and ceilings talking to others not you. Even in the case of Zenyatta and Ana who can do damage your incredible aim on either of those  would be better spent on an offtank or dps that could better utilize it.But yeah I definitely agree with the sentiment. For some reason people on roverwatch and rcompetitiveoverwatch hold on to the pipe dream that support heroes have the highest skill ceilings and its simply not true and people would know that if theyve ever made it to a level where they can compete.,Competitiveoverwatch,d9wzm9b,0,t5_34fcy

9617359,0,t3_5ck6bj,PSA Problem with AimBots is the fact that after Developers in season  found that creating cheats based on the game memory injecting would lead to being banned after a few hours cause Blizzard anticheat system they found a tweak by creating Aimbots based on color recognizon that dont inject anything into the client directly. They make thousand of screenshots per second looking for particular colored pixels those are not trigger bots but health bar bots and aim for that one. Thus its impossible for Blizzard at the moment detect those kind of programs. It would require an anticheat that scans the process list but even at that process names can be changed but its illegal in NA and EU.PS you have to mind also that even tho AutoAim is overpowered it also has lots of downsides like no prediction and no target priority.,Competitiveoverwatch,d9yjckw,1,t5_34fcy

9625390,0,t3_5csdy8,There was and will likely always be something wrong with the support meta just because there will always be one or two depending on whether you run two support heroes best support. at release those were lucio and mercy after the first big patch we had the lucio and zenyatta meta and now its lucio and Ana and every time the pickrate of the support heroes that werent top tier was extremely low. Whether or not you run one of our four support heroes currently is mainly decided by the strength of their output and utility not on synergies or whether they can counter an opposing lineup because they usually cant and if you want me to be honest as a support player Id rather at least play a hero that requires some mechanical skill and some aim in an fps rather than mercy and lucio again all the time. Im fine with Ana being a top tier support currently. The only problem is that her ultimate synergizes too well with others.,Competitiveoverwatch,d9zj0ak,3,t5_34fcy

9638616,0,t1_da1206m,This. What I find good at killing off stallers is not necessarily consisting of all of them but Mei since she is very good at picking off solo stragglers and walling off chokes and just surviving herself. A good blizzard can also help lock down that overtime.Tracer she is very good at dealing loads of damage and chasing down those annoying to chase targets and pretty good at surviving too.Reaper to do massive damage to those lone targets as well and with wraith form he also has pretty good survivability.Zarya since if they have a Mei she can dispell the freeze effect and the beam will go through Dvas shield. Relatively good survivability aswell with her health pool recharging shields and her bubbles.Lucio if someone is dancing on the payload he can be very good at booping them away making it easier to kill them also good at booping people who are out of range but are rushing to salvage the overtime. The booping is also very good at isolating teammates from eachother andalso  say if a reaper is focusing down one of your teammate a good boop can save him. His aura and survivability is very good as well.,Competitiveoverwatch,da15p5d,1,t5_34fcy
9640813,0,t3_5d2gvi,I am nowhere near as good as that but i think that is normal and that is the reason why widow is considered good for offense and not defense. In offense you just need to hit hard during those few seconds and suddenly there is an opening for your team to take the point. In defense you need to consistently hold the enemy off a pick might help in so far as delaying the enemy push while one respawns but all they need to do is push and waithope for you to hit a missing streak. ,Competitiveoverwatch,da1ffwh,1,t5_34fcy

9823925,0,t1_danjj3a,Theres always a top rung of a ladder and in the end climbing a ladder isnt actually the point of the ladder.  Climbing the ladder is perhaps the point of getting better but really treating ones rank on the ladder as a progress meter that you have to chase after is little more than selfgamification... a virtual carrot on a stick that you can literally never attain.  Mind you Blizzard certainly doesnt help the matter with all the special rewards it gives out for various degrees of progress that rewardcentric players are most certainly attracted to.  However the ladder itself merely serves to match likeskilled players with one another by systematically adjusting your place in the ladder regardless if that direction trends up or down... thats the point... fair games or at least to the extent that such a thing is possible.I actually lament all this extra fluff thats been tacked onto the system.  Take away the seasons the ranks and the rewards associated with them for all I care.  To me the most important aspect of playing on the ladder is consistently balanced matchmaking.

9948441,0,t1_db46zy0,No.. They dont.  First of all masteroverwatch collect data in in such a way thatd make anyone with a basic understanding of statistics shake their heads.  Blizzard said that season  rank  was top  while masteroverwatch said it was top  percent  i believe it was even greater but lets just go with    thats an deviation of over . and thats only within that rank. We dont know how big the margin of error is in other ranks which makes the data incredibly unreliable especially considering a deviation of two third is really bad.  Now your argument is that were comparing apples to apples since  the data should be consistent as its coming from the same source even if that data is unreliable but thats not the case either. Youre not comparing apples to apples since youre comparing data from the begining of a season to the end of another. Thats like comparing a big and mature apple to a tiny undeveloped apple. Not to mention the bias which being that higher level players are more likely to complete their placements and look up their ranking on a side like masteroverwatch before the average player will.  The rest of the proof of the devaluation of the ranks presented on this subreddit and your video relies mainly on anecdotal evidence which is completely useless.  ,Competitiveoverwatch,db4b2wz,4,t5_34fcy

9953456,0,t3_5i0o0f,gt When I play Dorado or Route  defense for example my team never thinks its a good idea to take high ground or defend further back we always end up defending right at the payload.The only thing worse than a bad strategy is a bad strategy that isnt being followed. As much as it sucks your team decided to take an inferior strategy so your best option is to make that strategy work as best as you can. If you can stay on the highground while still playing with your team often possible on healers or longrange characters you should definitely do so but if its not an option you need to support your team from a bad position.On Route  defending right at the payload isnt horrible because the enemy team will never organize a decent push from the left ramp. You generally wont be at a height disadvantage and you can still keep an eye on all flank routes from the payloads position. On Dorada its more annoying.gt I try telling them with my mic but players dont really seem to listen.What is it exactly that you say? And are you sure people are in the voice channel? Try typing it out and also give a good reason. Just saying Guys group up on the high ground generally doesnt work but in my experience Dont defend that far up theyll just respawn instantly and we have to run back further gets results more often than not.Also dont put in too much energy into uncooperative or silent teammates. At best you can repeat your suggestion twice keeping a friendly tone but after the second time just give up. You can still give status reports like Their Reinhardt is really low or Mercy probably has res but if noone is listening its a waste of energy to keep trying to get everyone to follow your strategy.gt  At this point should I just follow my team to suicide trying to protect them or actually try to take an advantageous position?If you can help your team from that advantageous position you should take it. Otherwise you should try to help your team as best as you can without dying yourself. Depending on the role you play your teammates can be made to retreat slightly just by playing cautiously. If you are Reinhardt and just slowly walk back towards a decent position your team will follow.gt Also if my team and the enemy team keeps trickling in on attack what could I do to turn the game in my favour? Ill be waiting for them to group up but everybody just runs directly out of spawn and goes to the point on their own and the only really logical thing I can do is hope everyone dies together so we have another pushTheres very little you can do. When Im healing I often stand still right outside of the spawn so people notice me and this sometimes works. Other than that you can explain why they shouldnt trickle in Theres no way we can win a teamfight against their full team if we dont all work together. or figure out whos doing the most work and stick with them.If you can try to group up with one or two friends. That helps a lot with making the rest of your team take good positions and not trickling in. Above all keep positive stay nice and lead by example.

If you played in the first couple of days you moved up with the crowd... if someone ended at  last season and started  weeks in theyd be matched with a lot of people who were  points lower than them the previous season.  The staggered starts lead to a huge actual skill range in those levels.Im already seeing people on my friends list who barely hit high platlow diamond last season who touched GM then dropped to Diamond who are again struggling to hit Master.

10011708,0,t3_5j0c30,I have a few questions regarding this. So how I always saw Tracer being good against the tank meta was more so her ability to constantly harass the back lineas a flanker. Sure she does good dmg against hoggood point about the armor countering her hard but the tank meta consistently revolves around Ana and her ability to heal her team. If Tracer is consistently in their back lines and harassing Ana she gets  of  options. She can choose to ignore Tracer and keep healing but likely die soon after or she can turn around stop healing and ask for help regarding Tracer and retaliate.That being said I have only a few games of organized v so I can see this not working as well in coordinated play. But from what Ive seen being able to distract their backline core healer allows our tanks to win the trade a vast majority of the time. You just have to coordinate when the shield gets broken down to Tracer so she knows when to jump out.What are your thoughts on this?Edit I dont think anyone can disagree regarding the biotic grenade though.

10018232,0,t1_dbd1kjh,It was by far the most enjoyable meta to play as well as a dps player season  before ana. Played mostly mccree to SR  and having to outduel other mccrees and catch genjis and tracers was fun and there felt like there was more variety in viable dps heroes and required more skill in actually playing the game.

10021274,0,t1_dbdkctx,Ive been pulling for EnVy for awhile now but it definitely didnt start out that way. I typically never pull for the favorite and as an American I think we have this learned behavior of rooting against confident or cocky player  we like our athletes in all sports to be humble. In the interviews yesterday one could argue that Taimou and Hulk were really cocky Taimou flashed a  to the camera I know Rawkus and Zombs did this before him on camera but Im not entirely sure that Taimou even saw them do it. Also when asked in a prematch interview how the match is going to go you usually hear athletes pay the other team a compliment and say that it is going to be a tough one and they just expect to give it their all whereas Hulk will just come right out and say that he thinks they outclass the other team and it wont be a difficult match. Im starting to think that its a culture thing and not necessarily a cockiness trait.

Even Rein mains will often say I main him because no one else wants to pick him.  The Rein main on my team asked the other tank player Do you think Rein is boring?For Lucio Id say give him the  damage melee attack again.  OR increase the damage of his boop by .  Players like Flame always talk about how fun and exciting Lucio used to be when he could v Tracers and really get kills fight back etc.  To make it fair you could reduce his health to .  Since he still has his own heal amp speed itd be balanced since right now hes so tankyevasive that hes hard to kill anyway so a slightly lower life total would make all the wall jumping and movement ACTUALLY matter a lot more.  Since it would more often be the difference between life and death.For Rein Id say just shift his kit around a little bit to enable more combat  less shield longer cooldown slower to recharge BUT increase his charge speed and give him a way to cancel a charge.,Competitiveoverwatch,dbe24re,0,t5_34fcy

10025324,0,t3_5j7l6l,Im a bit of a scrub but heres my solution. Reinhart. Zarya. Mercy. Ana. Bastion. FlexIf people are going to sit in full vision behind a Rein shield punish them for it.  Bastion does enough DPS to melt Rein shield and with Zarya Mercy and Ana tasked with supporting him hes going to build his ult REALLY fast and be incredibly hard to kill.  The whole concept is to put Bastion in an exposed position behind a Rein shield and just melt enemy tanks heads up.  Mercy spends most of her time damageboosting the bastion and keeping heals on your flex saving her ult to revive the Bastion should the worst happen.  That flex spot can be a lot of things  I like a nd DPS there especially Soldier  but realistically that will alternate based on player skill and situation.  It could be another tank a support or a DPS depending on the point and what you are facing. Its basically turning Bastion into KogMaw and melting the enemy from the front line on back.  ,Competitiveoverwatch,dbebsu7,1,t5_34fcy

You are McCree and the enemy team has a Pharah means everyone will think shutting down Pharah is exclusively your job and they dont help you out. The opposing Pharah may have Zen orb and a pocket Mercy on her. Theres a DVA in your face a Tracer around and your team isnt there to support you you will never be able to deal with the Pharah and she in turn will destroy the rest of your team. I think theres also probably a high psychological aspect to it DPS is the fun role almost everyone wants to play so nearly everyone is looking for ways to discredit the current DPS players so that they can take the role from them instead. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dbf7aa4,7,t5_34fcy

Any team game requires coordination the issue is that if the easiest strat is the most effective you end up making individual skills meaningless which is the opposite of what should happen in any sport. The easiest strat shouldnt be the most effective because  tanks dont require the same level of mechanical skills than a t or t dive comp.If the meta changes again in favour of some high skill hero team synergy is skewed by individual mechanical skills much more than this. If we end up always having overbuffed simple heroes that dont require much mechanics the game will simply end up being boring to watch because nobody will ever stand out.So I agree with your claim only because of the viability of the current meta and not because coordination in an absolute sense.,Competitiveoverwatch,dbgvaf9,1,t5_34fcy

Assume you know all  of them have ults and will use them right after getting up and assume they survive. Who do you pin and why? I see you like to play sym a lot. I do too but many teams in soloq dont feel confident with her taking a tankdps spot. What is your ideal team comp to utilise a sym? Assume the team comp will be  since ple tank almost always is ReinDvaRoad  Soldier  AnaLucio no room for sym in there. Do you replace a tank a dps or a healer for sym?

10170720,0,t3_5lkkqm,I made a post about it last night but it got removed for being low effort.Im in NA West around . Almost half of my games last night had a blatant cheater in them. The first game Cheater A was on the enemy team and one of his teammates was trying to throw for us by picking Genji and suiciding a bunch. We still lost. The next game had Cheater A on my team against Cheater B on the enemy team. This turned out to be a close match lol. Then later I queued against Cheater B again but with no cheater of my own so we lost horribly. And this is over a long period of time where I was waiting  minutes after each encounter to try and dodge them.To be clear these two cheaters were fullblatant no attempt to hide it everyone in the server was aware and agreed that they were cheating.It really sucks because even with a cheater we can still sometimes compete by going full tank but each time it just drags the game out for longer until the cheater starts hunting supports with tracer.The main reason I stopped playing CSGO is because the amount of cheating was too damn high.

Barrier Shield Reinhardt tosses a quick shield same proportion as his current at a max distance of m. The shield has  HP and cooldown is  seconds after the shield has fell below .  seconds cooldown if shield never falls belowEarthshatter changed toShield us! Reinhardt grabs a teammate reasonable range to stay within his boundaries and both are shielded for  seconds with a  HP shield that upon destruction or  second timeout Reinhardt slams hammer down to knockdown any enemies within range of the exploded shield. You could make it that Reinhardt only shatters the ground if his teammate stays in range for the entire duration that way they have the ability to run away if they so choose.This makes it so that its not a constant shield battle. Reinhardts shield barrier becomes skill based as he can toss it to block projectiles or to maneuver through a choke but the enemy team still has the choice to engage.As long as Reinhardt has his current kit itll always be reinhardt vs reinhardt ,Competitiveoverwatch,dbzv3sn,0,t5_34fcy

So can all of the other characters that shoot projectiles.But you what characters can still affect the enemy with some abilities even if they cant see them at all? Zenyatta disappears after a few seconds. So can Hanzo Scatter and Pulse. And D.VA ult. And Junkrat grenade mine trap ult. And Rein His E and Ult. And Tracer ult. And Pharah rockets pulse bomb ult. And Ana her E. And Symmetra turrets and wall if you want to count that and her gun. And Torbjorn primary fire if you arc it right and his turrets. And McCree stun. And  rocket. And Mei Primary fire and Ult and Wall if you want to count that. And Zarya Secondary Fire Ult. Let me know if I forgot any.Now to me you shouldnt have to be able to see an enemy to hook them. But you think a sliver of them isnt enough when there are all these characters that can damage and otherwise affect enemies without either the enemy or the character seeing one another?

10221231,0,t3_5ma5nn,Im surprised to see Ana seemingly get away without being nerfed by much. Sure  reduction on her  second cooldown is pretty big but it doesnt even begin to solve some of the deeper issues with her character. Her grenade has  SIGNIFICANT effects on a short cooldown. So now were looking at dealing damage to a large area to enemies healing in a large area to friendlies increasing healing by  on friendlies and cancelling ALL healing on enemies in a large area. Why should a healer have the ability to negate ALL healing done by the enemy team making her a hard counter to literally every healing support hero in the game. She can negate Zenyattas entire ultimate on a  second cooldown. I honestly believe Blizzard are on the right track by reducing the healing by  now please make it only block  of incoming heals and were looking at a more well balanced ability. Even with a  negation of incoming enemy heals youre still looking at a god tier ability.,Competitiveoverwatch,dc2mtni,2,t5_34fcy

If youre aware of the ult charges youll know its coming. Certain heroes like genji mei tracer and reaper are a lot harder to kill with it due to deflect ice block ice wall blinkrecall and wraith. I also think the claims of D.Vas downfall are a bit exaggerated. She still has the largest health pool. I believe she can still win a v with soldier if his heal station is down and her boost comes back quicker than heal station so she can probably still cuck him pretty bad if ana keeps D.Va healthy and she chooses her moments better.

10230117,0,t3_5me7h7,So far Ive been testing Low to High ground hooks and what Ive learnt is  there is no more hooking reliably from Ground on Dorado. Second point capture relies on breaking the high ground hold of the enemy team. While there are other heroes that can get up there to disrupt things it makes hog a walking Ult charge.There was a stage where Hog was only picked if the player knew he could make absolute worth of every single hook otherwise he was just free Ult charge. I see this coming back in.Breaking on LOS seems way too harsh at the moment. I can understand the gripes people have had with hooks in the past because they only see it from the delayMS of the server view.Before I rant too much  I would rather have inconsistent hooks where I can actually predict a players movement through soundbehaviour and land a hook when they grapple onto a building or dive a corner than speedboostsprintingstrafing breaking a hook that I actually planned out in my head via the same methods.,Competitiveoverwatch,dc3n35d,3,t5_34fcy

As long as a hero is fun to play fun to watch and not that bad to play against then it will be a lot less annoying for that hero to be OP. Mcree and Ana are good examples of good design Note this means she can be unbalanced without being as annoying as others while Dva and Hog are examples of bad design. Some are by design annoying as fuck to play against so they should be niche picks. But if you have picks like Rein and Lucio who are must picks every game pretty much they HAVE to fill all the things I mentioned. The problem with them right now is that they arent that fun to play.

10250129,0,t3_5mrg44,I agree fully. The chevron is a poor indication of distance which is the reason determining exact locations of your teammates is so difficult. When you rotate your view and see those icons your teammate can be  second away behind that rock or  seconds away coming from spawn. In my opinion that information is as important as the kill feed.Silhouettes not only tell you exactly who it is skinny widow or fat hog but how far away they are based on the size of the silhouette. It reads instantly.  It also feels better when playing knowing exactly where everyone is. That doesnt make it easier either I can still make incorrect decisions with this information as can the opponent but at least in this case I wouldnt have to mentally keep track of the positions of everyone on my team which is mentally taxing. You can argue that you should know where your teammates are based on communication and gamesense but thats not very realistic. People do communicate positions but not to that level of detail and if they did it would clutter the coms anyway. Players reposition themselves quite a bit in this game enough to not be able to rely on outdated visual information you see soldier on the right but in  seconds he can sprint across and be firing from the left. Another benefit of this is its an alternative way of checking comps inside the game instead of constantly hitting tab. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dc5wpu4,156,t5_34fcy

If someone is sprinting towards cover and they get hooked right before the corner their momentum will carry them past the cover and then they will get reeled in. The reason this is an issue is singlehandedly because of ignorant people. They will immediately call it a bullshit hook and then cry about it to Blizz then Blizz fixes it.

Really the only characters I cant play as are Sym and Winston but they arent really relevant enough for me to care about. I think Flexing is a big part of competitive play. What happens if you get  DPS mains on a team? You need to be able to play characters in every role and if you cant you shouldnt be playing at all honestly. Flexing doesnt mean pick heroes youve never played though yeah some new players do think thats what flexing means sometimes it means getting up to a level of proficiency with enough characters so that youre okay if the team needs a slot and youre the only one left. Forcing the rest of the team to adapt to you is honestly selfish imo. Because just by you forcing yourself into a role you might be forcing someone else into a role theyre uncomfortable with.

10303333,0,t3_5nfraz,Its a maps design problem really not a heros one. As long as all the maps have rein shield siezed chokes youll need a rein. As long as you have maps so that the fight is forced to happen in a close enough space to be covered by an earthshatter youll have a rein. You could nerf his earthshatter but youd still need him for the shield. Nerfing his shield would obviously be non sense because that would make him shit tier and simply there would be no reason to play him.Adding another hero that can fill his role but different is simply put impossible. To fill his shoes he needs a shield. If it has a shield we already have rein. Giving him a different set of shift  E  Q abilities would make no difference.Lets say we make a different character. Lets imagine something different enough but with a rein sized shield no point otherwise. Id imagine a lighter tank lets say  HP with a ranged gun something like sombras seems fair shitty enough with a lucio stile boop and a  dmg  meters long cone cleave as abilities. Oh and the shield  hp just to make it a bit lighter than reins same size and dynamic tho. Perhaps heshe could shoot the peashooter while keeping shield up to make it interesting. Ulti whatever needs to be different than reins so lets say a  Hp zarya like bubble for teammates in a  m radius. All in all a decently balanced hero more or less just to get the point across.Now what would stop you to run this one alongside a rein having  total barrier hp covering a larger space or different angles? Fucking nightmarish man.What we need are maps with different design. Run Rein in the ones with rein shield sized chokes pretty much all of them now dont run rein in the others. There would be nothing wrong with some maps favoring certain heroes and pretty much being a no go in others.,Competitiveoverwatch,dcbxs7n,1,t5_34fcy

10322304,0,t1_dcc7nx6,Mercy will absolutely never be played until she gets significant buffs even if you straight up remove Ana from the game which you seem to be gunning for. Well just be back to Lucio Zen every game like season . Its due to her very teammate reliant design and lack of utility outside of healing. If your teammate positioning is off you just straight up die. If you get flanked and no one helps you die. No other healer or even character is this reliant on their team. Youre also completely ignoring all of Anas downsides. She has  mobility so she cant escape a bad situation unless she hits sleep dart which is a skill shot on a fairly long cooldown. If she misses it shes straight up dead against most jenemies. Most Ana are really bad at hitting flankers with the projectile shot. Nade only does  damage less than a single shot. Shes also the only healer that can have healing blocked by positioning whether by enemies or allies. That can easily lead to ally deaths if anyone in the game simply walks in front of them both shots and nades especially in a hectic team fight. Shes also the only healer that has to reload and also the only healer that has their self sustain on a cooldown. That means that she is extremely vulnerable to diving in single healer comps. She would generally have to pick between healing herself between team fights and saving it for a crucial nade in a quad tank composition. Shes usually not on the front lines which is the only place where getting all four effects is possible  and she generally has to choose offensive vs defensive nades. Projectile vs hitscan is not something in her favor since its something she has to learn how to aim and those skills dont transfer over easily. Thats kinda why DPS slots are usually split between projectile and hitscan in pro teams in . Nanoboost was also greatly nerfed with the speedboost nerf. You cant really use it to engage anymore outside of combining it with a DPS ult. It also still has a wonky targeting system which leads to Boostios. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dce38zx,0,t5_34fcy

10354841,0,t3_5o9rqa,Ive asked a couple of top  players mainly pro players who stream about the same issue and the two answers I most often got were to a duo que more since that allows you to reduce the chance of getting a troll  griefer... and to make sure that you can combine ultimates with your duo que partner. So if youre running Roadhog pick a Zarya for the Graviton  Whole Hog combo. Ultimates win team fights and if you win those you win the game. And b was to really really step it up in terms of positioning. The better you get at positioning yourself near escape routes safe zones health packs and your teammates the longer you stay alive and have more impact on a match. Obviously as a tank thats slightly less possible but even tanks can improve their positioning often. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dchs5fr,3,t5_34fcy

10370893,0,t1_dcjk6bw,Having all heroes on an equal footing regarding pickrate is an ideal that will undoubtedly never be achieved. Reinhardt is mandatory in competitive play since he provides safety and he is his self counter. On the other hand in pro play you often see dive comps where Winston is run as the only tank but this strategy requires extreme coordination to be efficient which is why in competitive where communication often lacks Reinhardt is a safe bet.Concerning Lucio hes usually replaced by Symmetra in Defense at least in competitive play. I believe he is fine in his current form he still provides a lot of utility but far less than before. And in my opinion he is very healthy to Pro play  he allows very dynamic playstyles by making everything quicker which is in fact the reason why many plays are so impressive to watch and he enhances the game itself by setting high standards for communication and coordination. EDIT  Though I acknowledge the fact that watching more diverse comps would be nice ! To add on the commentary you deleted Im confident the meta will shift at some point anyway. Blizzard just wants the different metas to last as long as they can to increase its games lifespan. First it was the double Winstondouble Tracerdouble Lucio meta then the more diverse  meta and finally the overall tank predominance led by Reinhardt and Ana with temporary powerhouses such as Reaper with the Beyblade meta and then D.Va who ended up shaping the tank meta...Considering Overwatch is at its early stage I believe any hero will have his time to shine and Reinhardt his time to fall some more than others definitely.

Outside of the Top Levels of Overwatch shes more reliant on the enemy team making mistakes as well as your own ability to assess situations to make the most out of it.

For the entirety of Season  and for the beginning of season  I played without a mic. I always typed in the chat box to regroup back up save ults etc. but it gets ignored very often just because thats the nature of the game. I was stuck in Plat  but after I got a mic and started calling shots I noticed a significant improvement of both my enjoyment and performance of the competitive ladder. In addition if you start talking over the mic others who have mics but dont talk over comms generally start to shotcall more as well which only adds to your teams performance overall. Currently in upper Diamond I cant articulate enough how important a mic is in a game like Overwatch.,Competitiveoverwatch,dcpl52l,16,t5_34fcy
10424378,0,t1_dcplx11,The methods of climbing out of each Elo are vastly different this particular tips might be of little use to climbing out of silver.But above average mechanical skill can carry you into at least plat for sureif you play DPS never tried with a Tank or Healer before the few times Ive dropped below plat mostly last season and  time at the start of this season I always climbed out by just outplaying the enemy DPS.Ive never personally dropped to silver Elo before but my last season low was ish I only ever fell that low once and I climbed out exclusively in solo que and I literally learned how to play tracer and dived their DPS not their healers all game basically uncontested theres so little coordination when youre that low you can really take advantage of it and get away with some pretty insane shit its not easy but you can definitely out play entire teams since no one is coordinated enough to stop you. I imagine Roadhog and D.Va are the same in the current patch. But once you get into high gold some things change.Honestly this probably sounds horrible but Id stop trying to coordinate until youre in at least mid to high gold. You probably wont get anywhere at least in solo que. Just try to carry by outplaying the enemy DPS. If you get a  stack together then you can just coordinate well and destroy everyone of course but coordinating with randoms in silver and bronze is probably impossible Ive seen footage  everyones just doing their own thing anyway but that applies to both teams.This wont really teach you how to play the game though just how to punish lowlevel mistakes which comes in handy far less often at higher ranks starting at probably high gold where you really need to have at least some coordination to win team fights so while you may hit gold people start to become slightly more coordinated in high gold and you might find your self dropping and climbing back and forth until you learn how the game is played at high gold which is where you either have to retarded levels of mechanical skill to be able to outplay the enemy DPS without some help from your team or just coordinate with them and tell them how to play the game being polite is super important Golds tilt at incredible speeds plats arent much better Getting out of gold is basically just tilt management of your team and knowing when to make pushes.,Competitiveoverwatch,dcpo7lp,2,t5_34fcy

10481481,0,t3_5q2ri1,I was literally just talking to my friend about this yesterday. Bastion is undeniably a bad character but hes only ever gotten nerfs since launch I was actually speculating that maybe Blizzard didnt wanna buff him because of how much newer players hated him. Glad to hear I was wrong.In regards to what they would change I have no idea his design just doesnt seem to lend itself to this type of game. The only thing I can think of is making his recon mode better making his turret mode worse reducing his transformation time and making him similar to a stance character in a fighting game. Thats still really vague though.,Competitiveoverwatch,dcw6n21,2,t5_34fcy

10482928,0,t1_dcj8era,I personally do not agree with this logic...many people often sayyou have to get two picks on widow to even be worth it. That is not true at all. In fact if you take out their Ana andor their sym youve literally just insta won the team fight for your team if they slowly push to point...however if you were to pick one of their off tanks roadhog and pick off their luciohealer...which is two picks...thats not the same as getting one pick and taking down their anawhich is a far more valuable pick...Widowmaker plays a very similar role to genjitracer in that he can flanktake out the healerssupports...many people scream for a swap to soldiermccreewho are also amazing dps characters but you wont necessarily win the game especially if you have  angle on their healers...i do agree that you need to swap when you are being countered or cannot find any angles on their healers but if you can get into a decent position attackoffense uncontested while being able to take legitmate shots at their healersbackline whether your missing your shots or not is irrelevant eventually you are going to land your shots and get the kills...if you cannot get into a decent position and dont get any good angles on their backline supportthen I absolutely agree to switching.It also depends on enemy team compositionif they are playing hard counters to you AND if only and they are killingpreventing you from getting any kills yes then swap off widow is merited. But if the other team has a winston and even a genji but you are landing kills and picks on the genji and winstonyou are not really technically being counteredespecially if you are still able to get good anglesshots at their backline support.A lot players that play widow counters such as divawinstongenji in competitive often are only swapping to divawinstongenji to hard counter the widow not because they are good on those heros. I often run into characters that are not good at divawinstongenji and you can really tell. Just because the other team has a counter hero it doesnt really mean they are countering you...It takes a lot of experience as genjiwinstondiva to actually be able to hard counter a widow...you cant just straight line bum rush the widowwhich is what a big majority of players do...and good widowmakers will also have their widow mine sitting on flank routes protecting their flank and main anglesplayers dont seem to understand that,Competitiveoverwatch,dcwcjn1,1,t5_34fcy

10590247,0,t3_5rlv6b,The problem with Ana is that she does too much. She is too versatile and too resilient against flankers at the same time compared to other supports.Her antiheal decides tank vs. tank battles completely negates Zens ult and at the same time delivers her an instant HP swing against flankers while her CC is one of the best in the game and her damage is hitscan with a scope.What Blizzard needs to to is decide what to keep of these two. If she is to keep her versatility with the heal boost and antiheal she needs to be more vulnerable to flankers. If she remains as hard to kill especially with skilled Ana players for lowHP flankers she needs to lose some of her utility to the team.,Competitiveoverwatch,dd8awaa,58,t5_34fcy

10600676,0,t1_dd9dm5b, With Chance taking this much damage by Mykl they really shouldnt have forced a push here. If they knew that Ajax had ult then they wouldnt have pushed in anyways and if they knew he didnt have it then they would feel rushed to go in as soon as possible. They are using  Ultimates here lucio sound nanoboost dragonblade to win the fight which in Theory would have worked great but with Chance dying so early Iremiix can ult the entirety of Immortals completely negating whatever Agilities is trying to do. To be fair Agilities failed his dash as well meaning that he wastes alof of time just going from enemy to enemy but using the ult there definetly felt forced. They should on one hand make sure that the team is healthy before going for an engage they need to make sure that they know the enemies positions they were oblivious to Mykl standing to the side battering Chance and Agilities needs a plan for his ultimate. Them not knowing where the members of ghost were positioned just messed this play up and they used so much for it. Even if they only used nanoblade a couple seconds later and Ajax would have countered it with his own ultimate then ghost would have no answer for Immortals imminent Grav Pulsebomb giving Immortals a chance to take the point. But instead they tried to make the Nanoblade work even though they had another option to take. That Nanoboosted Roadhog Ultimate was a mistake. Fight was won they got  Ultimates out of Immortals. They really didnt need to use  Ultimates for essentially nothing. I cant see the perspective very well here but in my eyes using those  ultimates was unnecessary and may bite them in the butt later on. But then again they have Ajax ultimate so they remain pretty safe for now especially with the point capture closing in on an end. Grim using his Ultimate here really sucks. They already wasted  ultimates for a fight they end up losing why throw the Pulse bomb in? Hyped has his Ultimate very soon and Grav Pulse bomb is their Last chance of touching the point. He shouldnt have panicked and just waited a bit. Ajax using his ultimate was a bit too agressive. While they could have bought some time they shouldve just waited for immortals to attack again. Soundbarrier and Mykls ultimate would have saved them the trickling at the end and it could be considered a safer alternative.  Look at the point capture and look at the Graviton Surge. If that Graviton Surge had a Pulse bomb in it then there was definite potential for a retake even though it may seem like the round is already lost. Ajax using his ultimate means that ghost has no way to responding. The only problem would be time as Grim would need to be super fast getting from the Graviton Surge to the point but if Agilities hadnt died earlier and instead walked towards the point to trigger Overtime they could have done it. So in conclusion gt As soon as Agilities saw that his Nanoboosted Dragonblade wasnt working because Iremixx used his Earthshatter he should have given up the fight and go towards the point so that he can later on trigger overtime. Then Grimreality shouldnt have used his ultimate but instead wait for Hyped to get his and prep for a retake. Once they respawn Hyped lands his ultimate on the way too cocky Ghost combo that with Grim pick them all off because they have no Lucio Ultimate to counter it and Agilities not being needed at the fight anyways without his ultimate could have taken the point before the  hit .Round  Very sensible Decision by Immortals to go for a Roadhog. Their Teamcomp mimics what Ghost had last round. Very predictable but alot better than what they had before. While they only have  good Ult combo they arent lacking behind compared to Ghost who also only have  Zarya  Road or D.va Ult but now they are going to be able to deal with flankers Which ghost dont have anymore but more importantly the Dva. This is after the Year of the Rooster Patch meaning that Mykl is going to have some serious problems against the Roadhog and even Grim on Tracer. Grim is going to get insane amounts of Ult charge meaning that if he plays smart he can keep BAM Dead all the time so that he can continue farming Ult charge on the  tanks without BAM getting any in return which would make the Tracer pick completely worthless. Ghost now relies even more on BAM and with Immortals running a Tracer and a Genji in the first round it was predictable they were gonna keep at least the tracer. This round will not only be decided by the Reinhardt Zarya Synergy but also by Grimrealities pressure on BAM and ConnorJs Pressure on Grim while Agilities tries his best to keep Mykl down so that Grim has more space to work it because the Defense matrix could be very annoying for him. One advantage that Ghost have is their insane Tankyness which makes Immortals Graviton Pulse Bomb combos near useless. I mean he needs to go through a Reinhardt shield Defense matrix and  Zarya bubbles. That is pretty hard. While Ghost lacks this combo they are basically completely nullifying immortals teamfighting combo whereas Graviton with a D.va or Roadhog Ultimate cares neither about Verbos Sound Barrier nor about Immortals triple tank. ConnorJ being distracted by Chances Charge really gives Grim the space to work here killing Babybay on Zarya with ease and further pressuring the Backline. While Connor managed to kill Chance in the end I dont think trading Zarya for a Reinhardt was worth it. If it werent for Ireemix killing Agilities this fight would look alot more grim for Ghost. And it is really bad that Agilities didnt manage to unmech D.va not only for the free ult charge since Ana cant really heal d.vas destroyed mech and the amount of damage road does thanks to her huge headshot hitbox. I think it is a mistake though that Immortals didnt push onto the point though while the entirety of Ghost was busy with Chance in the Building to the left. They could have had the upper hand and fought on their own terms by taking a position on the point but they hesitated for too long and only Grim stands on the point to somewhat zone it although Connor probably wont care too much about that. While Grimreality continues to kill stuff uncontested because Connor focuses other targets which costs iremix his life Verbo gets picked pretty soon. I think this trade is pretty even and with Ghost having the better position here the first point is theirs. Immortals really should have capitalized more on Ghost chasing after Chance and Grimreality destroying Babybay and remix in the end.  Connor not focussing his attention on Grimreality who right from the start was expected to be Immortals dominant player now that Agilities switched off genji really screws with him here. While he was killing Verbo and Chance Grim got incredible amounts of ult charge on both Iremiix and Babybay both high hp tanks which gives him this super early pulse bomb netting him  kills and a chance of Immortals taking the point that was ghosts for the taking. Very crucial mistake of Ghost to not focus their attention on the one thing that can kill them. I mean Chance and Verbo are the last targets that needed to die on Immortals lineup. It was a good Idea of Grim to show up behind Ghost as they try to push in in hopes of killing BAM which should be his primary job and upon which all of ghosts lineup stands. But him getting sleepdarted was both avoidable and crushing as Immortals lacks any stopping power while Grim is sleeping so Ghost taking this point here is to be expected. I didnt expect BAM himself giving his team this opportunity but Connor to do so but apparently he has to do it himself. While missing this hook here may seem crucial it wouldnt have done anything anyways. Immortals already lost their Ana and Reinhardt so Agilities has no way of getting healed up while the nanoboosted Iremiis is being hooked. If grim would have had a chance to partake in this fight then he could have easily killed BAM and prevent both the Nanoboost and the insane amount of healing he puts out in that fight. Immortals best chance for a Retake here is to use all of their ultimates in  big fight. Hyped comboing his ultimate with Grimreality alone wont be nearly enough to win a fight especially not with Ajax getting his ultimate pretty soon something they should know as Verbo almost has his and them losing the last fight as the insane tankyness of ghost will be able to stand against it easily. If they do however manage to kill BAM and get a really good Reinhardt Ult down probably even in combination with a Zarya ultimate which is incredibly inefficient but almost ensures that the earthshatter will land they can shred through Ghosts frontline with ease and take the point. They wont be able to hold it but at least they will prevent Ghost from getting points until they get a better plan. Like getting D.va instead of Roadhog in order to better Protect Grimreality their only chance of winning really,Competitiveoverwatch,dd9dn4x,2,t5_34fcy

AutoIT is entirely different from what I am doing. AutoIT with Overwatch has a single purpose. Sure you very well could automate this task with AutoIT but not with the same logic. So I can see where your confusion might stem from. However you also need to realize that these cheats that caused this banwave youre talking about were almost all scripts that were posted publicly. Then compiled down using AutoITs AUTgtexe software. Meaning they had the same exact footprint as other users. So yes that would cause a massive ban wave. Notice how many of the smaller private providers didnt get waved at all? Thats because theyre giving out unique builds and changing poly techniques frequently. So when this man says dont use this youll get banned hes dead wrong. Because this isnt you downloading software. This is you using a websitediscord bot that I am making at no cost to you. So no this cannot get your account banned. End of story. Could my account be banned? Sure. If Blizzard specifically goes out of there way to do so. But it wont be hit by any sort of detection.

10661504,0,t1_ddfhdk9,gt  I just dont get how someone can say with a straight face that OW isnt interesting to watch for most people when its among the top games in terms of Twitch viewership regularly sitting above both CSGO and Dota . As an esports its not as a big yet but to say nobody enjoys watching OW is just absurd the only game it generally cant beat in terms of Twitch viewership is LoL.    I didnt see your edit with my inital post so i will just make another comment addressing this part.  You are right that for streaming OW is fairly successful but you also have to understand that the package you get when watching a streamer is completely different from watching a professional tournament.  Why do people watch streamers? Sometimes because the streamer has a great personality something you dont notice at all in tournaments. Others watch streamers to learn you can do that quite easily because you have that one perspective the whole stream. You can see how that specific guy plays the specific hero. Its the individual skill part which gets checked here one of the most important aspects of enjoyment i think. its the soccer example in my other post   What is important is that when watching a streamer on twitch you wont get a tournament experience.    With that being said OW has a very large playerbase which is a very important aspect as well. It means there are lots and lots of potential viewers. All the things i mentioned so far mean that imo only a tiny part of this potential playerbase will actually enjoy watching OW esports. But with  million players i would imagine that means copies sold not necessarily active players though?! that tiny fraction might still be enough to have good numbers who knows.,Competitiveoverwatch,ddfnio3,5,t5_34fcy

10716539,0,t3_5t8gcv,I think its quite plausible that Blizzard valued the similarities between ranked play and tournaments and thus used predetermined maps to a enforce a big enough map pool which therefore wouldnt allow for specific practice for a map for pro teams which in turn forces the practice of specific comps instead. This creates a solid meta which is far more emulatable in solo queue than specific strategies for in effect  different maps  maps  KOTH having  each maps.b have a relatable map pool to solo queue too. Its reasonable to assume that without these changes these two modes wouldve drifted apart even further. Ive proposed the idea that with the Apex format in place and the top teams now competing and practicing in one place tournament strategies will soon depart from the realm of possibilty of even your high level solo queue games. ,Competitiveoverwatch,ddlby1v,2,t5_34fcy

10722699,0,t1_ddlcs3t,Yes oneshots are not a fun mechanic pulling someone into your team is very strong on its own. Its not hard to hit has a massive hitbox the favour the shooter mechanics makes it frustrating to try and dodge because you can still get grabbed even when youre ahead of it.I dont have as much of a problem with the widow or hanzo oneshots they actually have to hit a headshot with a small hitscanprojectile. I still dont think they are fun because theres not a lot you can reactively do against them.Im not really surprised that he can still oneshot though narrowing the spread buff and pulling them slightly further from you nerf seems to be two things that do the exact opposite and probably leave him in the same spot but with more out of hook combat ability.I think balancewise hes also further compounding the reinhardt problem in that you kind of need one against hog because even your tanks are dead if not behind a rein shield.Finally  seconds isnt that long for such an impactful ability plenty of abilities that arent nearly as good have a longer cooldown  scatter arrow flashbang charge etc.,Competitiveoverwatch,ddlytn4,8,t5_34fcy

10737599,0,t3_5tlzmh,gtHog was completely unused at higher ranks up intil the dva buffThat is straight up not true. Hog has always had usage and there have been a few spikes every now and again. When mccree FtH was nerfed hog usage went up to replace the cc of flash. During  hogs usage went up due to discord not melting him as fast anymore and as an ana ult battery amd because he was a good counter to nano rein. The beyblade meta kept hog in check do to the presence of mei and reaper. gtAfter that and hog was totally unchanged mimd you suddenly magically he became slightly overpowered never mind that you practically cannot play without a Rein so they gave him a nerf in hook .. Hogs benefited from the global ult charge nerf more than most other heroes because his strengths were made more important and his weakness were made less important also one of his counters in mei was nerfed one of the meta reports point out that hogs success rate goes down when meis playrate goes up Hog also just does what you need to do to win fights hog breaks barriers and gets picks which ever since the ult charge nerf is how fights are won. gtThen somehow someway by some miracle roadhog actually became more overpowered after having not only been nerfed having had his biggest healer nerfed and having had the catalyst for his being in the meta in the first place dva also nerfed.The hook . nerf wasnt that big a nerf due to his self heal hog was hurt the least of all the tanks by the ana nerf and the biggest nerf D.va got was that hog hookshots do more damage to her.gtSo of course they decided to follow up with a much more significant nerf that cements his place in bronze and in Harbleus smurf.Have you tried nerfed hog on the ptr? He kills  hp targets just fine and his weapon is better than before so you are arguing that an  sec cooldown on hook makes him useless.,Competitiveoverwatch,ddni3ew,1,t5_34fcy
10738523,0,t3_5tlxh6,GM Pharah main  hours totalIts really a tossup to be honest. Maps with more coverflankable routes are generally better this explains why Gibraltar is great allaround for Pharah especially hangar phase but the more open ones the pillary one on Ilios or the Nepal maps can be tricky I tend to either dominate and pressure very well or get very pressured and have to play the peak game minimizing my impact. The key is to play around your team comp and their team comp well.Do they have a hitscan thats constantly zoning you? Are you playing with your team or at another angle this answer is situational? Are you engaging with your team this is a necessity to maximize your impact?In terms of personal preference I enjoy Ilios the most because of the different ways I can peak and flank around the buildings. A lot of other Pharahs I know particularly like Lijiang and I do too sometimes but LijiangNepal can be more hit or miss depending on how well my team and I play with each other.

The ladder is still a ladder unless your winrate is ridiculous then people who play more games will probably be higher than you. Ive decayed to k from k got back to k then decayed again. For Honor isnt gonna help my situation. But other than grinders Ive noticed two kinds of top hundos. Mech gods this is what I would be if I was good enough to be top  which Im not and Gamers.The mech gods have better aim than you at top  they also have good positioning and knowledge of game mechanics but their win condition is clicking on heads faster and more consistently than the other team. I can click heads better than masters players and worse than top  hundred players in general. IF I was as good at clicking heads as top s I probably have the gamesensepositioning to also be there. But IF my positioninggamesenseteamwork was a lot better than it is now I would probably also be top  even with my current nontop  GM aim. In that situation Id be more of a gamer.TLDR As a category they are better than you as a GM in every way. As individuals theyre likely to only be better than you in specific ways.

Most of if not all the heroes the author writes about are in good shape imo its just that the meta is a finicky beast dependent on team compositions where simple rehearsed solutions will usually prevail over risky ones.  Players are fickle and if a majority assures someone a character isnt worth playing they wont to avoid backlash but we all know the community can overreact en masse. Some characters are always going to more popular with the fan base on a strictly aesthetic perspective  and others on their skill curve. Theres a lot more that goes into the selection and balance than X character is running a redundant kit for X scenario and should be given more tools.

10777219,0,t1_ddrl7z9,I agree.  What Im suggesting here is that I think theres a way to expand the options for how to do that without making his survivability that much better with a side effect being that it potentially gives some characters like Sombra a bit more of an opportunity to shine.Movement speed doesnt really make Zenyatta much stronger against the usual ways of killing him anyway.  At best it buys a fraction of a second.  The real impact is on the other aspects of how he plays and what he is able to do.,Competitiveoverwatch,ddrlc4p,5,t5_34fcy
10777625,0,t3_5u5qlc,Dont see why he should have his weaknesses toned down.  We have a healer that can v all the dps with a strong chance of winning Ana  a healer that can fly away every  seconds and passively self heals while you are reloading mercy and a healer that is probably the hardest character in the game to kill Lucio.  Its a tradeoff.  Zen pumps out insane damage WHILE healing and increasing focus fire damage.  ,Competitiveoverwatch,ddrmu9z,140,t5_34fcy

10779036,0,t3_5u6vk3,Id agree but lots of people have a skewed idea of whats the team meta. For me as long as the team has the essential functioning parts i.e a main healer that isnt Lucio and a damage mitigationabsorption hero theres a solid chance to win. For some others there must be a Lucio and Ana. Or there must be at least two tanks. Hero picks isnt what loses games in matchmaking anyway its the lack of coordination. A  the most common successful team comp in the history of Overwatch is as likely to win as a  or a  or a  etc etc. Its only when the complete extremes are happening like  DPSes and one Mercy where the game would get much harder to win. Though at that point its obvious that your team synergy is already cracking. Therell never be a real meta in soloq its just people trying to imitate others and at the end doing what they believe is best. Not everyone is going to reason their picks correctly. Like playing triple tanks lots of people dont understand how triple tanks actually work. they just do it because others are successful with it. Or running torbsymmetra. More and more comps are going to have a meta that doesnt follow  that doesnt mean they are automatically bad and have a lower win rate.,Competitiveoverwatch,ddrs2fj,9,t5_34fcy

10786629,0,t1_ddshj40,It takes  out of  shots for Sombra to kill Zarya and she has no burst abilities. Zarya is forced to bubble against Soldier Reaper and Mcree because she can be vaporized by a rocket andor headshots in about a second from  HP. Sombra doesnt have that kind of burst unless youre getting dozens of headshots in a row and even then Zarya can wait as long as possible on bubble because she doesnt have to worry about the damage spike. Its a steady predictable stream of damage. Sombra has to have backup or Zarya can just kill her without bubble.

10794290,0,t3_5uds1g,Before this reddit thread was created I wrote a response to this video here The text written below is the same as in the medium post.It cannot be overstated how poorly this petition and request was handled and that the ramifications of it will most likely be felt for months to come.Lets start with the first issue how the request was framed. This could have been a slam dunk opportunity to warn the roverwatch crowd about the various pitfalls that large game subreddits have run into in the past the various outcomes of potential fixes and how the submission rules of roverwatch could be setup to preempt the sustainability issues that other subreddits have run into in the past. Instead before even the end of the first paragraph the current quality of the submissions to roverwatch is attacked though the use of a term that within the general Reddit community is considered to be inflammatory. If I was a moderator of a subreddit and I was getting told in a letter that had less signatories than this post was upvoted that my subreddit was flooded with low quality content Id take that as an attack and not as someone looking to help improve my community. Id go even further to say that in the postmortem video indirectly accusing the same mods whos help is needed of bias and laziness is a very easy way to discourage them from working with you in the future.Second we of course need to look at the actual request. Instead of targeting a way to raise awareness of high quality long form discussion instead the petition sought to try and force a MASSIVE cultural and content shift in a k member community that has shown  signs of actually wanting a change in content. If your goal is to try and convert the current casual base into becoming fans of the competitive if not the professional scene based off of my experience in the TF community I can easily say that antagonizing them is the wrong way to do it. Rather I believe that the smarter action would have been to find quality longform content that would appeal to the CASUALunranked community and try to show both the moderators and the greater community what the subreddit is lacking and then work on ways to promote nonesports longform content. The first step to getting esports content on the main subreddit isnt to discourage posting of the current content but rather to plant the seeds of a cultural shift.Finally I have to question the decision to have Montes name the the one most prominently associated with the petition. Surely the writers were aware of the reputation he has among many community members who regard him as someone whos arrogant and at odds with authority figures? By attaching Montes name to the letter they associated all of the assumptions and perceptions that the community has about him to the letter. This had the effect of readers personifying the requests being made into a representation of Monte rather than a unified community. To me this demonstrates shortsightedness because as a moderator Id feel an obligation to push against a request being penned by someone whos publicly spoken against several different subreddit moderators in the past. Surely someone like Doa would have been a much better choice of a figurehead no?At the start of the postmortem video the way that the original letter was described is very similar to what Im proposing is submitted. I wholeheartedly believe that had the originally planned letter been what was seen by the community rather than the current petition it would have been much better received and this post wouldnt have been made at all.I write this not to try and act like some knowitall whos telling the people who are attempting to create change that theyre doing it wrong but because I genuinely believe that there is still an opportunity to both admit that the current petition failed and create a new more moderate request that shows the competitive community is willing to work with the moderators of the main subreddit. The time to act and lay the foundation for change is now and more importantly I do not believe that the opportunity has been squanderedyet.,Competitiveoverwatch,ddtcrn7,197,t5_34fcy

10815993,0,t3_5ulvbu,Ive become something of a party favor on PS by maining sombra. I play solo queue and climbed from  up to now  almost solely with Sombra. Now people add me and invite me to teams going lol dudes check out this kid that mains sombra its insane which is nice because my sassy little highlight intro shows up regularly now. Some pointers I have are Sombra almost requires communication. Even if youre the only one talking make calls and your team will follow up. Whos hacked? What heath packs are hacked? Where are you going? Wheres your ult at? Sombra is a total game changer especially if your team can utilize her. Hack. This ability is extremely undermined. There are a ton of heroes that become pathetic without their abilities. If Pharah is giving the team trouble and soldier is struggling to take her down wait until you see her start to putter while her boost is on cooldown and hack her. She will fall helplessly to the ground. You can usually finish her off yourself. Believe it or not Sombra is a hard counter to a hacked Roadhog. At least until the scrap gun patch. He cant heal he cant hook hes just an ult sponge. Hacked Rein is also just a big ult sponge for you and any other dps that put some shots on him. I initiate almost every fight with a hack. Positioning and cooldown management. Ive never watched the cooldowns of a hero quite as much as I do Sombra and its because her abilities are so core to her play. Since her invisibility has a  second timer on a  second cooldown she can be invisible for almost  of a match. Use this. Ill keep to the high ground and wait for the enemy team to push and invisi down behind the tanks and put a hack one of theirs. This turns what they thought was a  vs  push in to a  v .. is your translcator on cooldown but the team needs help? Invisi get in there put out some damage launch that thing back towards the team and get out. I hate watching sombras stand near a health pack and wait for their cooldowns. You have an ult charging machine in your hand and you can literally be invisible right now. The Ult is broken. Dont even lie its too good and it comes too often. The best way to use it in my opinion is to translocate above pop it kill a shield monkey ie Zarya or Zenyatta and then invisi for a reposition. After you pop your ult if your team follows up youre usually the last thing on anyone on that teams mind so you can pop a few free kills before you need to leave.but anyone this is just some of the stuff I try to focus on when I play her and its gotten some pretty intense feedback.

10836047,0,t1_ddxm4u6,Dude what are you even talking about? You cant just throw out terms and expect it to mean something this wasnt a top level play in the slightest.  His positioning consisted of dropping off of high ground into the most confined space ever losing a huge amount of sight and being forced to scurry to the car with Reinhardt so he didnt get killed like an idiot. His targeting consisted of targeting literally the opposite of what he should have. He went Lucio gt Soldier gt Ana killing Rein by accident in the middle when he should have started with the over aggressive Ana especially since the Ana was threatening his own Ana and because she had a sleep dart up which happened to miss him  get blocked by the Rein shield. Hell before he dropped down and ulted he was focusing the full health Zarya for whatever reason instead of finishing off the Roadhog sooner or pressuring their completely uncontested Ana and Soldier.

The only one that poses a threat at close range is Roadhog but with his slow rate of fire its super easy to juke him and never get hit. There is risk that Tracer needs to get closer but she ignores shields much better than Soldier does and can get out pretty easily. Soldier is fantastic at midrange but not so good at close range where he cant escape hammerWinston or long range where his damage falls off.

You never want to peek. Without charging alt fire  when Roadhog is healing with ana bio grenade it is so much better to discord charge up and wait for him to finish. If you are trading rein shields and the enemy reins shield is about to go down you should charge up alt fire and aim for the healers or dps or when youre getting flanked by an enemy with hp or lower you can discord hide behind a corner charge up discord and blast them in close range followed by a melee and they will almost certainly be dead. Many more cases where right click is useful if you are interested just browse through my reddit profile.If youre having trouble shuffling orbs while dishing out damage then you should just focus on the discord and damage part while trying to use your ult for countering enemy ults only. Because noone should pick Zenyatta for healing.From my personal gameplay alt fire is my primary way of getting kills and I use it  of the times when I play Zen.,Competitiveoverwatch,de0jhjs,1,t5_34fcy

10870689,0,t1_de0ydwt,Yeah his damage output is low but that doesnt mean its insignificant. For example I had a match where a low health Rein was sheilding multiple teammates in a grav surge to block the Dva bomb combo. While the rest of my team just tried to shoot and bring down the shield I just went behind it finished Rein off with critsboopmelee and made a multikill happen. Its only insignificant if you use it insignificantly.Having basically no interaction with the teammates he is boosting is part of what makes him fun. You can do basically anything you want as long as you keep people in LOS and dont die. If youre not doing anything with that freedom thats on you.And with booping yeah getting kills with it is for the most part only a KotH thing though there are locations for it on every map except Anubis. Im not sure exactly what falls under moving people away from key positions for or why that wouldnt be a fun inpactful and skillful play but there are all kinds of fun uses for the boop that are impact plays  redirecting Rein charges especially after earthshatter cockblocking hog hooks pushing an ulting reaper away from your team etc. shit Ive used it to shut down a deadeye before.  ,Competitiveoverwatch,de18frf,2,t5_34fcy
10870902,0,t1_de10cog,if youre on dps and not getting kills or doing alot of damage youre not doing your job. doesnt matter what you do in comms. medals do matter despite what some people say. i think ranking performance is very good maybe they could add hidden stuff that affects performance like  of people shielded from enemy rein ult by using ur own shield to impact performance  of solo kills a dps gets to initiate a fight to quantify if theyre doing well or not of people antihealed that died within X seconds of them being antihealed etc..,Competitiveoverwatch,de1988f,1,t5_34fcy
10873626,0,t1_de1ht81,Zarya shielding Earthshatter is more of a prediction than it is a reaction which makes it not reliable. I dont know how many times I saw a Rein knew he was going to ult shifted after he started his animation and then got shattered. My ping is usually in the s. The shatter casting animation is . secons according to Overwatch gamepedia. As a reference Genjis Dragon Blade cast time is  second almost double and S Visor cast time is . seconds. But alright lets assume Im a trash Zarya. Zaryas bubble only blocks Earthshatter sufficiently if you are standing right in front of Reinhardt on the spot where he dropped his hammer. The more distance you have. the less Area you protect and your teammates will get shattered. So you may stay alive as Zarya through Earthshatter it is far from guaranteed your Teammates will. Even if you are close enough to Rein your bubble has a cooldown. If its on cooldown tough luck blocking shatter. Reins shield is not on cooldown assuming you know what youre doing as Rein and never let it break.Overpowered to me means that if you had two identical teams assuming a usable teamcomp not  dps etc. a team with Lucio will have better chances of winning than the team without simply by the nature of having the hero. For example assuming a standard comp of  a team with Ana Lucio will perform better than Ana and Zen. Normal comp or dive comp it doesnt matter Lucios speed boost just provides to much utitlity for both. It is debatable if Lucio Zen will do better than Ana Zen because Ana is still overpowered but I can see it at least working better in a dive comp. Im not even going to bother with Mercy she is only superior if you are running Pharah which is a very nich case.Same goes for Reinhardt. A team with Reinhardt as a Tank will do better than a team with another tank as a replacement. Whether that will be free damage from behind the shield or free Earthshatters Reinhardt provides too much utility for your team not to have him.Reinhardt is not countered by anything in this game except himself. D.va dps is laughable her mobility is her main selling point. Roadhog does a good job of breaking the shield but feeds the enemy team free damage while doing so except he is standing behind a Reinhardt shield himself. In addition his shield is a better counter to hook than for example Zarya bubble since hook is on a  seconds cooldown and projected barrier is on  but fortunately that is about to change. Zarya is the only Tank that comes close in Utility to Reinhardt but again. Reinhardt  Zarya will smash any other Tank Combo with Zarya.Graviton Surge is only better than Earthshatter in combination with Pulse Bomb or Hanzos ult. Graviton allows for the enemy team to either escape it wraith form dash etc. or counter its effects with Transcendence or Lucio ult. Or you know just lift your shield up as Reinhardt youre going to block a big chunk of damage. You cant counter with anything while you are stunned for . seconds by Earthshatter. If your team is in the area where you shattered you will kill almost every target that was shattered resulting in a won Teamfight.EDIT Just as an anecdote if I remember correctly Lucio used to have higher damage on his primary fire resulting in him being played as a sort of DPS support and being picked in every team. Talk about overpowered.,Competitiveoverwatch,de1jcji,3,t5_34fcy

In fact I have this littler personal belief that even the biggest pros dont actually get the most out of her these days because nobody considers the distance you can take her or maybe its just inhuman to expect such results.But still.

10875307,0,t3_5vf901,Got a season high and career high at . Also finished at that rank as I couldnt play more before the season ended unfortunately. Really wanted to hit master and push to GM this season but I just didnt play enough.I only started season  when the lunar event started and at that didnt even play  games. I feel like if I had more time I could have hit my SR goal for sure as I was steadily climbing. But I never had any streaks like a lot of people talk about have never had any in the  seasons so far other than a  or  loss streak last season. I always win one lose one or win two or  then lose one. I just always gain way more SR than I lose like  SR for a loss and  for a win not on streak. Though I do feel I have improved a lot as player this season in regards to my positioning and overall awareness of the game. I always felt that I had the aim to compete at a higher level but I absolutely lacked the game sense and would get myself in a lot of trouble that was easily avoidable if was just more aware. I now keep track of ults much better than I used to utilize high ground much more as a hitscan dps my mains and prioritize targets much better than I used to. I dont just mindlessly shoot at whatever is in front of me anymore haha pSo overall I would deem this season a success and set my sights on season  next week and hitting at the very least masters  ,Competitiveoverwatch,de1pl7n,1,t5_34fcy
10875544,0,t1_de1pfm9,The most important things I think for climbing out of plat is solid DPS  either by queing with someone thats actively trying to improve by practicing their aim or by filling that role your self.In plat your matches are decided by which team is better able to keep their mediocre DPS alive long enough to get some kills  or by the DPS players hard carryingand despite all DPS players in high plat thinking they can do this they very likely cannot which is why theyre stuck in plat lul. So IMO while Rein is unfortunately necessary you also really need good healers too or like I said the DPS players hard carrying.Solo Q Climbing with rein in lower ranks is probably impossible without getting REALLY lucky.,Competitiveoverwatch,de1qgv4,2,t5_34fcy

I like playing competitive because I can assume that people there are playing to win  theyre playing seriously.

10894008,0,t1_de3mr7w,You guys are talking about hypotheticals that are hardly ever existing. Fights are decided by one pick. Roadhog is the king of picks over a god damn sniper in the game. You want to make that worse? He has effectively  HP and can one shot people from mid range or just do what he does best and force the entire team to not make any skillful and interesting tactics because roadhog forces them to be  m away or behind a rein shield. He wins almost every v and even if its v all he has to do is land a hook and make it v because again he has an additional  HP to play with. Stop defending this disaster of a character design. The devs literally never asked themselves huh is this BS? Does it feel rewarding and make the victim feel outplayed? Ive never once landed a hook and said damn Im good. Ive had plenty of those moments playing ana and making amazing sleeps but thats a skill shot that has an impactful CC and requires a lot of skill to effectively use. ,Competitiveoverwatch,de3n1du,14,t5_34fcy

10913278,0,t1_de5goc8,In a a strictly technical sense sure Ana takes more mechanical skill. But Zen is de facto a much more difficult healer to use well as things currently stand. Not only is Anas skill floor artificially being raised by the potency of her kit in a broad sense the game sense ceiling for her ultimate to speak in a more constricted sense is significantly lower than Zens. It really isnt that hard to learn when to use an Ana ult. Zen on the other hand is not just a braindead antiGraviton machine and if youre against any lineup without a Zarya discerning the optimal time to ult with Zen becomes a very difficult task in comparison to using Anas ult especially in terms of getting the most value out of Zen throughout the course of a game. Sitting on an ult because you never know quite the right time to use it is a frequent occurrence with Zen especially for new players. Determining whether or not you should use a Zen ult offensively is also notoriously difficult much more difficult in terms of game sense than Ana. I mean why do you think Zen is played so infrequently in comparison to Ana? Its not because Zen is bad its because Ana is too good and because of that too easy to win with in comparison to Zen. The same thing said of Zen can be said of Mercy as well.Slipperyslope arguments wont work here nor will emotional affinities for ones rightfully deserving I should say in the case of Ana main. Nobody is calling for Ana to be nerfed into the ground. All thats being asked is for players to rationally address the proposal on offer what if Ana simply didnt do any healing or damage with her grenade? Thats it.What could you foresee happening? Less GOJFCs for Ana? Good! Thats how it ought to be. Thats why shes overused. Anyone can throw down a biotic on themselves with a flanker on them and ward them off.

10963415,0,t3_5wiqwp,I think its easier to list who you should avoid rather than who you should focus on honestly. Who you should focus on varies a bit based on your tier and how new you are to the game but I am going to assume you are still fairly new havent prestiged yet.So here are my suggestions. Avoid  Genji  He is one of the hardest to master and takes a wide array of skills to be effective with him.  Torbjorn  Not only does he underperform at high levels but he just isnt active enough to really make you better at the game. You want to play somebody that forces you to learn good positioning team coordination etc. while not being utterly horrible while youre learning not sit in the corner and try not to die.  Hanzo and Widowmaker  Snipers have their place... But its pretty circumstantial and you also have to have good aim or you will be trash to your team.  Reaper  I hate to say this because I love playing Reaper but the riskreward ratio is not very favorable unless youre an excellent flanker. In which case Tracer is probably just as effective at getting kills with an easier time getting out.  Sombra  She is still struggling to find her place and her strength lies heavily in her ultimate  team coordination.I would also add Bastion to the list if not for the new changes that are likely to go live. This could disrupt some of the rest of my list and at least makes him plausible to learn.Everything else I think is pretty much fair game. There will be some characters that youre not particularly fond of their playstyle and youll tend to avoid them regardless of what people say which I think is perfectly fine. I dont play Roadhog or Zenyatta because Im awful with them and I just dont enjoy them. There will also be some heroes that you like the idea of but struggle to pick up and I wouldnt worry about those right away either. Who those heroes are I cant tell you because it depends on your current strengths and weaknesses. I for one am just now picking up Ana because I realize she is incredibly useful but prioritizing between healing and damage is really tricky so it takes some keen game sense to get down and I wasnt prepared for that when she was first released.For reference my comfortable heroes are Junkrat Soldier  Mercy Reinhardt D.Va Winston and Lucio. Of course Ive played a bit of everyone but these are the ones I feel I am moderately effective with. I think this is a pretty nice crosssection of heroes from different classes that can cover a lot of different situations. I started out a Junkrat main but I quickly moved away from him as I found Soldier to be more effective the better my game sense got despite my mediocre aim. In addition to Ana I am looking to learn Pharah next as that aerial superiority sure can be a nuisance and sometimes you just need a way to disrupt the enemy when youre having trouble breaking through.  Good luck on your pursuits!,Competitiveoverwatch,deasrws,1,t5_34fcy
10963737,0,t1_deam7fv,I specifically stated it would be something that prompts you when chosen. So upon queuing up for comp solo you may get chosen and you will be allowed to accept joining it if you desire to do so. Regarding the argument of it boosting people how is a whole team winning a match they may have otherwise lost due to the team losing a player any different? Also the odds of successfully gaining off of this filler role significantly is probably very low. I cant see SR for people drastically changing given youd likely not get chosen often and the odds of winning must be pretty low given you are joining a team that is likely already loosing. Only issue I see this model in is the higher tier players that have a smaller pool to pull from but leavers probably occur far less up there. As for the trolling aspect thats irrelevant. Would you rather be a man down or someone trolling by picking a Hanzo or torb or whatever. Id much rather have another member of a team than no member at all.  The only argument is they may feed ult charge to the opposing team but you have the same odds of getting a troll if not more from just queuing up a game. Again to me its irrelevant. ,Competitiveoverwatch,deatyyx,1,t5_34fcy
10964166,0,t1_deaup3f,gtI already mentioned earlier this doesnt really work in practice. Show me a game where theres never more than  heroes on the objective or where theres never a skirmish over the objective. Normally in a dive comp setup lets say on a Payload map..You have Zarya approximately around the payload.You have Lucio speed boosting somewhere around the payload or maybe running forward to assist his team to engagedisengage.You have Zen or Ana sitting back near the payload.Then you have Genjior Pharah Winston and Tracer diving enemy back liners killing them the shortly returning for heals.The entire idea is to stagger the enemy team and keep them as separate and spread out as you are.So... . How is Reinhardt going to build ulti charge against that comp?. Reinhardt can ulti the point and kill a few heroes and while this happens the flankers are likely staggering his team more or they just fall back and regroup and push again.gtThats not how teamfights work and I think you know it. Heroes being out of position priority targeting a collection of vs is being way too overnarrow. You took my comment out of context. I went on to describe how there are  different kinds of counters and how they all interact to explain the mechanics of teamfights.If you dont believe me about team fights being a collection of vs try picking Junkrat and Mei into Pharah and Tracer.Before you can win a team fight you have to have heroes that will kill your enemy. If you dont have anyone who can beat Pharah v then how are you going to win a team fight ?If you dont have anyone who can counter Roadhog hooks how are you going to fight v? Someone will always be getting picked.If you dont have a way to shred tanks how are you going to take down a tank heavy comp?If you have a Reaper and a Mei into a McCree and Soldier youre going to get out poked and outranged as neither of those heroes beat the other  v. These are just simple examples but it extends to the entire team.gtYeah look at the history of the meta and when you realize  times out of  theres a Reinhardt on pro teams even now Id say thats an overwhelming majority of Reins. Since the numbers dont persuade you Id like to know whose opinion you would need to persuade you that this is true Ive heard it from a variety of grandmaster streamers and while itd be hard to go back in vods and get them saying it I could try to find one.. The Pro Meta does not necessarily reflect the pickrates of heroes in competitive mode.. GM Streamers are as open and susceptible to making fallacious arguments or having incorrect or biased opinions as anyone else.. There have been times in the Meta going back to Beta where Rein was NOT a top tier pick and Rein hasnt been changed. This supports my argument that its not REIN who is the problem its the META around him.gtWell how else would we objectively determine if it was vaible? Time. You cant change the balance of the game twice a month introduce new heroes every few months and expect the Meta to settle.Take  tank Meta for example...  Tank Meta evolved into  tank meta and then the game was changed. I fully agree that the changes needed to be done and I honestly think there are still some remnants of the  tank meta that are left over and still need to be nerfed namely anas bio nade. That said no matter how OP certain heroes and comps are it requires TIME for teams to come up with practice and prove out new strategies. If you change the balance of the game every month or two theres not enough time for teams to come up with answers for the Flavor of the Month. That FotM just gets overplayed and nobody really comes up with an answer to it.Now imagine for example... That you just made MINOR tweaks to heroes over the course of a year. In that year you would see several Metas crop up. Maybe the  or  tank meta would dominate the majority of it but then there would be an answer.. Maybe GenjiTracerWidow? Maybe a Dive comp? Maybe Quad DPS? Maybe Double Hitscan Reaper Zarya Lucio Zen?Any number of things COULD evolve... But if you change the game every month you never give that a chance to happen.If you never give the meta a chance to settle into place you never find out what is viable because people only ever play fotm.We are in a pretty good spot right now balance wise. All we need is a few minor tweaks as I mentioned before and wed be the most balanced ever.Then we should just chill the fuck out and let the meta evolve some.Just my opinion.gtI just want a meta where he doesnt feel so necessary to every team unless you run dive.Hes not necessary. I win games all the time at Masters level with no Reinhardt. Pro teams are more organized and they are playing FOR PRIZE MONEY.Youre likely not. Take a risk. Try running a game without him. There are ways around Reinhardt.In Season  I ran a team comp at SR  with friendsZarya Lucio Zenyatta McCree Soldier Reaper.We would sometimes swap  DPS out for a Pharah depending on map and enemy comp. It sounds crazy but it worked against some very good players and we were playing vs  stacks. ,Competitiveoverwatch,deavkcv,1,t5_34fcy

If in a week the only winnable comp in higher levels is centered around Bastion then sure there is a problem.

But I feel like a hero with so much in her kit needs to have a weakness and I would rather have an interesting hero with a weakness than a simple hero she wont be simple after the nerf but simpler for sure without one. I still feel like you can overcome some of the frustration with getting better game sense and positioning. And I dont think this game should be balanced around a team composition having a single healer. That would mean that every support would have to be a Mercy  not very complexinteresting but has enough heals and sustain to do it.Though an interesting change would be so that grenade only heals you  so you still have selfsustain.

11085506,0,t1_deoi86y, damage per hit is not hothing correct. It is just enough damage that you can charge the other teams ults really efficiently without actually killing any one.  Most Anas recognize that it is very tight timing to actually get kills with her threeshot gun. She is at a significant disadvantage versus any DPS in their effective range. Her sniper capabilities might be a bit out of hand but thats more of an issue with Solider and Mcree than with her if you ask me.Sleep dart is plenty interesting sure.Grenadeshot was just nerfed in to oblivion so not sure what your point is there.Being able to heal a teammate is not interesting no. If it were people would play more support dont you think?Being able to damage an enemy in a v is... not very interesting if you dont really have any chance of winning the fight.You seem like someone that doesnt play Ana much if at all.  I recommend you play PTR Ana and see how fun she really is. In fact start maining her.

11092931,0,t3_5ye6xr,Some details Ive seen Your crosshair placement tends to be off.  Your awareness  game sense could definitely use improvements e.g at  you can hear a Symmetra following you. You look for a brief second dont see her didnt hear her? and proceed to ignore the flank completely until shes onto you. This can really get you up the ranks.Both  are mostly covered by this Skyline video Ill link you since itll explain it better than I could  but basically try to aim at the places where enemies will be at and not at the floor and at head level instead. You can also improve your target prioritization. You often times shoot targets that are being pocketed while not outdpsing the healing at all and you should focus the healers a bit more than you tend to. You shoot at heros bodyfeet regularly instead of going for their head. Should move your cursor up a bit to get those sweet headshots P Ive seen you go into cover over and over despite not having any worthy threats on screen or around you and even when you still have  of your health left.

11101914,0,t1_deq3wrw,honestly its probably not according to some internally consistent damage rule and is more likely a hard coded thing that happens because the designers said it should. If I had to guess its to balance out soldier fights versus other long range characters that deal all their damage in one shot. Soldier cant peek around a corner throw out a headshot for  of your hp and then wait safely behind cover while his half second of recoil finishes up  his damage is dealt in a steady stream over time and he has to remain exposed that entire time in order to be effective. In a hypothetical hanzowidowmccree duel against soldier if they body shot him and he flinches hard enough to start missing for a few moments that loss of damage will probably cause him to lose the duel. I see extra flinch as a way to even it up and prevent flick damage dealers from just completely shitting on soldier.Mind you that is just my guess and I have very little to back it up.,Competitiveoverwatch,deqe4ub,14,t5_34fcy

11113285,0,t3_5ynz8o,Playing Mercy correctly does not mean you are just rootbeer tapping your teammates and power boosting at random. It is calculated healing swapping to offensive boost when it makes sense e.g. soldier shooting down a Pharah or Junkrat destroying a Reinhardt shield. She also must manage her shift carefully so she can stay safe for the resurrection. Also she is supposed to pull out her pistol to get key frags when enemies are low something which low level Mercy players often dont think to do but is what makes Mercy really rewarding at higher levels of play. ,Competitiveoverwatch,derojmb,9,t5_34fcy

Top  players dont have superpowers its not like nothing gets past them. Theyre going to have their focus on something and miss whats going on behind them or around them. They wont always have the best idea of where all  enemies are and since they obviously arent holding the same viewpoint as their teammates someone else on the team could help by calling out positions. Are Reinhardts with their shield up supposed to have eyes in the back of their heads? Your mindset just doesnt make sense to me.

11142701,0,t1_deuz631,Honestly I wouldnt mind the variance in individual games if it werent for streaks. Lowvalue wins or highvalue losses would be no different from games being thrown teammates DCing or any of the other little things that can cost you a single match theyd all even out in the end if you just played more.The issue with streaks is that not only do you need a ridiculously high winrate to guarantee climbing but youre actively discouraged from continuing to play. Are the trolls out in force one night? Do you keep getting matched with people who DC? Well you could keep going enjoying the good games regardless of whether you win or lose and practicing survival in tough situations when you get a bad game... but if you get one legit loss sandwiched between two bad games itll take  nonstreaked wins just to break even! Hell if the SR variance is against you it might even take  or  streaked wins because your last streaked loss alone was  and your win streak is all  games which is likely because probably the most common way to get a high win streak is to get matched against a lot of weaker teams. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dev0i94,3,t5_34fcy

I think a lot of people see roverwatch will just worship the devs for any addition to the game despite it being a fairly basic feature that shouldve existed from the start.anyway while those things will improve the overwatch I still think that some of the games fundamental design aspects are frustrating and hard to improve on. the sole focus on v teamfights and the high frequency of one teammate dragging a team down are two things that I personally find very unfun at times. like someone else said though maybe my expectations for overwatch are just too similar to games like to tf or quake and I should adapt to these fundamental design aspects,Competitiveoverwatch,devkx8i,5,t5_34fcy

The top answers are always paragraphs listing over a dozen teams and players and they each inevitably said you have to do your own research to figure out who you want to watch and when theyre playing.  A simplified league removes that barrier of entry.  Go to the league website find your local team and see when they play.

Volskaya nd on attack has upper right elevator gt forward upper right gap that he cant cross defence on Volskaya st you can go from forklift or back right to the roof of the building over point without Lucios speed boost using roll but its really hard to do consistently you usually slip off.Plus itd make roll a little harder to aim at without giving outright iframes.,Competitiveoverwatch,dew4r7e,1,t5_34fcy

Either way something needed doing.And while I appreciate the want for a Mercy character largely passive and reactive I feel like theyre shoving more and more characters into a supportive role. For example D.va went from an interesting if underpowered for some time flanking dive tank that could be used to break up subjectively boring defenses and cause interesting chaos and is now a mobile Defense Matrix. These people are supposed to be Heroes  stars of the show. Instead of knocking everyone down to the lowest level they should be lifting up the under performing heroes.But having played most Blizzard games I know they wont do this.

They certainly wont find appeal in Winston who just auto aims for you or Lucio whose only purpose is to just exist and otherwise does shit damage.DPS characters are just very fun to play for a veteran FPS player.  Compared to Tracer and Genji a character like Lucios gameplay is a fucking bore.  The fact that characters like Lucio and Reinhardt are required has completely killed my interest in playing competitive at all.

But the problem with ana is she didnt need protection she can kill tge flankers by herself. I think blizzard knows thats a game design failure and make the protection of support role useless. Maybe ana will not fun to you anymore because you cant play rambo ana and really now need good positioning and mates to help you.

I think a good support player is often underappreciated or simply not noticed as much outside of clutch ults because theyre never filling up the kill feed. But the truth is good supports are helping out their team A LOT even if its not as noticeable as a great DPS or even Tank player. Ill use myself as an example. IMO my two best supports are Lucio and Zen. For Lucio two major mistakes I see other Lucios around my level do are ult unnecessarily if a Zarya gravitons and combines with another ult  has damage coming from other team members sound barrier probably isnt gonna cut it to help your team survive youre better off saving it for another push and not utilizing speed boost to its maximum potential. As Zen I usually look for highpriority targets usually enemy supports or whoevers being focused by my DPS as my Discord targets.

Theres always the random factorplayer movement in projectiles.Take for example symmetras right click. Can you really predict that much? I dont think you can really predict that much after the m range. Right? Does that mean her skill cieling is infinite? I think people have to be a bit modest with their opinions. Not everything is A and Bs. Im not saying youre the only one  wrong in the discussion.Im pretty sure Blizzard changed the projectile speed so people can hit more shots because of the nerf to the aura range. projectile speed might lower his cieling but its negligible the character has alot more mechanics then only the gun...

11235201,0,t3_60bu3a,Pick a hero you want to learn and just play them whatever.For me its Sombra and Im genuinely enjoying playing quick play more than comp at the moment. Shes frustratingly gimped in some ways but when you get it right its so satisfying. Also she melts bad hogs and dvas which you get a lot of in qp.When the team clicks you get a good game or a steam roll when it doesnt youre just improving your one on one skills. Most games i see have one tank one support usually on both sides so it evens out. Each team will have at least one handle or widow. So who really cares about winning?I dont know how qp matching works but i only get moaned at one in  games at the start. Just ignore it. When i do an EMP theres only a  chance my team will even try to take advantage of it its not an environment conducive to high cooperation.Another way of enjoying  a qp more is that  Im completely outclassed by one player I will deliberately try and engage them to get better rather than switch to a counter hero. Ill stick in the same matchup rather than leave and try until i start beating them.Ill still occasionally pick hog when were getting really thrashed as he tends to dominate qp as everyones running around being DPS hero spam.,Competitiveoverwatch,df5ht9t,1,t5_34fcy

LW Red X and wNv.KR for example arent in Apex Division One but can compete with the top Apex Divison One teams. The top  NA teams can hold their own against the top  Korean teams.

Theres nothing going on in the Overwatch esport scene that anyone should really give a shit about besides Apex. Im pretty into the scene at this point but Im still ignoring basically all the tournaments besides Apex theres no prestige to any of them whats my incentive to watch? The only reason would be just pure enjoyment of the game which in all sportesport isnt why casual viewers watch imo. For example I dont even watch Dota but Ill tune into The International I dont watch much CSGO but Ill watch a major every now and then. Liking a team of course would be another reason to watch but personally Im finding it difficult to become a big fan of a specific Western team without any LANs or again any prestigious tournaments going on.Im not saying OWL will begin a better spectator mode will be released and Overwatch will be guaranteed to be in the top  most watched esports.

Her ult also seems to take longer to charge than other ones so I dont think shes that viable on attack or KOTH even though the ult could conceivably win a pushI like your use of Long range tank she definitely melts in frontline combat and would benefit from something more like Zaryas positioning the difference being that her Halt and Primary fire would be used reactively to take away enemy positioning. For this reason I think synergy with Roadhog and Reaper are interesting avenues to exploreLong term shell be more of a niche tank. I find that I have the most success on Point B of CP maps since her barrier and Fortify are great ways to fight through the inevitable CC abilities that the attackers will use to win the point.Final note I also find that Orissa is a great counter to Mei thanks to Fortify.

11357520,0,t3_620gmp,its entirely blizzards fault. even if they never buffed her into OP status everything in her kit suggests she should be able to fly up to someone bullykill them and then fly away. if you screw up you lose your mech but still have a chance of getting away. she is highly mobile her guns are only good up close she has a second life allowing her to be more aggresive her defense matrix only helps when she is very close to the enemy otherwise her teammates have to stand right next to her to get the benefit...and of course her personality of obnoxious gamer gurl is NOTHING like the other tanks in the game all of the tanks who actually protect the team have friendly personalities and voice lines where they mention supporting the team except roadhog who doesnt have any abilities to support the team. Even dvas DEFENSE MATRIX voice lines dont even acknowledge the fact that she has a team to protect....So yeah even if Blizzard never buffed her it isnt surprising at all people try to play her as a flanking assassin. But THEY DID BUFF HER. TWICE!! for about rd of her existence BLIZZARD MADE HER a bully who flys up to people and murders them...and now blizzard claims she was never supposed to be a bully...bull shit. absolute bull shit. People in platinum cant even figure out that reaper and junkrat get shit on by pharah but theyre supposed to figure out that DVAs job is to babysit the ranged dps and occasionally stall the payload? yeah...not ever gonna happen. the DVA players are dumb as fuck to be sure but they arent any stupider than the junkrat mains or the reaper mains.

11400139,0,t1_dfo4xy3,Personally i agree with your assesment of sentry but that is whhhhy im not happy with it. It doesnt feel fun shooting down shields all the time and honestly i still feel like it is only ok at killing tanks but is almost worthless for anyone else. I would just like some more efficient dps out of sentry. Whether it is his spread reduced or an increase in fire rate i would like to be more threatening to all other than just tanks for the lack of mobility and low sentry survivability. I would happily trade iron clad in sentry for the old sentry spread so i can sit a bit further back for safetys sake and still hit targets. Because right now i feel like i need to be close to mid range. Not quite front line but close to it for sentry to work on anything but reins shield. Though that range means death if ya sit there for long.  Though recon is amazing and shouldnt be touched. I just want a small bump in sentry damage output efficiency to bring back his unique sentry form. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dfo6wb6,0,t5_34fcy

Competitive is to PLAY TO WIN above all else. If you want to goof off there are plenty of modes. In SmiteLoL people play the casual modes a lot and no one complains because it developed seriously enough. Sure there is still some goofing off but in Smite for example if you play casual conquest people still usually try even if they pick off meta gods. Blizz caters to casuals too much. Casuals do not keep games alive. They come have some fun and get bored. The people that really keep games alive are the ones spending thousands of hours playing recommending the game to new players streaming the game and Esports. Look at any successful game that has been around for a long time and its almost always going to have some Esports side and some competitive form with dedicated players.Casuals are not who the competitive mode around.

I think overall Blizzard does a good job about adding soft counters that come down more to skill matchups like Tracer vs Hog or Mccree for example and its good Pharah is in that position now and not just unplayable because of pre nerf Widow or sniper Mccree. As far as the community goes though it seems like in comp for example if the Pharmercy isnt dealt with your solo soldier with no pocket is shit like its reasonable to expect him to deal with that situation in the video solo but if it were a Tracer dominating a control point nobody expects the same dominance from a hog or Mccree in my experience.,Competitiveoverwatch,dfqvylr,8,t5_34fcy

11435221,0,t3_636ad4,Its not really a flaw per say its just that the statistics the game uses to measure how well a dps player is playing fluctuate a lot less than supports or tanks. If a team is doing well the dps are always going to be getting kills and doing a lot of damage. However that isnt always true for supports. In a blow out win a support player will probably do very little healing and have very little impact on the game in general since usually a blow out win indicates that the tanks and dps players simply outclasses the same roles on the other team. So basically while dps will always be heavily rewarded for every win the same cannot be said for supports and tanks. That is why the top  is mostly dps mains since they get a consistently high SR reward for every win so they rank up faster than the other two roles.,Competitiveoverwatch,dfs65ye,3,t5_34fcy

Fnatic is a lot more than that they also have an EU LCS team which is in playoffs and an EU CS team which is  series win away from getting into the EU LCS which means Fnatic could get . million dollars from that maybe even more considering the price for an LCS Spot is only going up. They also have a top  CSGO team and is also one of the most popular teams as well. They also have a hand in other games like Fifa HS? Vainglory and so on. And on top of everything else last year they opened a shop in London for their merchandise and their keyboards mice headsets and so on. Fnatic is a lot more than just the Overwatch team and honestly I really dont think they are spending a lot of money on it at least until Blizzard starts the OWL in EU as well.

And genji and tracer can just farm ults off hog once he misses his hook and dont just say without worrying bout his life cause hog can be one of easiest targets to take down once focused down and people can farm ults from him. You would know what Im talking bout when you see a match like kangdoo panthera vs meta Athena where meta just shuts off evermore hog Hoon just farms ults from him and how that bites their ass. In and all just wanna say mcree isnt in a bad place at all maybe he can use a decrease in his CD but I wouldnt go and mess with his fall off range cause that would incredibly broken. And I still dont think hog can do everything better than mcree without worrying bout anything just cause mcree takes more skill doesnt mean he is useless. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dg3w72b,0,t5_34fcy

11544683,0,t3_64ru7u,It sucks that high MMR people on new smurfs wreak havoc those first  or whatever games. However Overwatch has millions of players. Unless there is a statistically significant percentage of players smurfing at any given time the havoc is just something well have to deal with. As for onetricktrollpick smurfs well I dont know that theres anything that can be done at the moment at least until we get a reporting system that is both functional and difficult to abuse.In all likelihood it will always be an issue. If the issue ever reaches some level of pervasiveness that threatens the health of the game it sounds like Kaplan will be there to address it. But theres only so much that can be done with smallscale crime.Edit I should clarify that the onetricks I was referring to are the people who onetrick troll picks not just things that happen to be meta though they suck too in the sense that they also make games worse by upping the risk of running into conflicting onetricks on a team in addition to forcing people to play around them instead of playing around the other team.,Competitiveoverwatch,dg4lb80,7,t5_34fcy

The main heals Mercy or Ana have to the proper tools to do ranged healing without screwing them or their team over by not being shoulder to shoulder. Plus with his new Boop tweak hes able to peel even harder for his team which is even more the reason for him to be in range.By no means am I not telling you play him the way you want but if you can hold your own running across map getting proper ult charge for being in any given situation and healspeed your team then go for it.,Competitiveoverwatch,dg54lt7,2,t5_34fcy

11671359,0,t1_dgipc1z,Sombra is kinda ineffective as a flanker compared to GenjiTracer because her spread makes it difficult to kill healers quickly and her escape is a total disengage that requires some prior setup which means a lot of downtime. Genji and Tracer can get in and out and dodge shots with double jumpdash and blinkrecall. Sure she has a lot of out of mobility but its a little awkward in combat sometimes and her killing power isnt always high enough due to hitboxes. Her damage is pretty good if you dont miss. Sombra works much better when focusing on disabling tanks and contributing damage to shields because  spread doesnt really matter versus shieldstanks and tanks are the class most affected by hack. Shes more of a disabler akin to Meiwho really shouldnt be flanking than a fully fledged assassin like Tracer. Her tank bustingflanking capabilities are also somewhat similar to Reaper who flanks occasionally but mostly sits with rein shield.That doesnt mean she shouldnt flank like for killing shield genspulling people off choke but doing the loop of health pack  Tele  harass for a bit Tele back is not something you should always be doing. Just because you have a skill up it does not mean you should use it immediately because that can be wasteful if you dont use it at the right time stealth is more or less a glorified speed boost sometimes. Also you can use translocator mid combat for juking abilitiesconfusing opponents or for quickly gaining high ground which using it for an escape all the time prevents you from doing. ,Competitiveoverwatch,dgiyqce,3,t5_34fcy

And Pharah isnt a huge issue with  HP with a  self heal. McCree sucks at fighting dive comps because of zero mobility.Also that was during the time that beyblade existed and Hog feed a lot of ult charge during S. When everyone got hit with a ult charge nerf in S this was a huge buff to Hog and thus making picks far more important while not feeding as ult to the enemies. And note this was also a time that s damage was utter shite and didnt see play for that reason. And even if you nerf s damagesay  it wouldnt fix any of McCrees issues in the slightest. McCree still have zero mobilityunlike  still struggles when facing DVaMonkeyflankers unlike Hog a trash ultworse than Hogs Piggys ult is decent at creating space while doing tons of damage in a quick session. and finally doesnt combo with nano.Ana has been the face of the meta for months and with her kit she will always be picked unless someone finds a OP combo that doesnt involve her.  All that would do is make PharahMercy even stronger while its already strong asis.

A majority of the reactions Ive seen to the Thorin piece have been dismissive many angrily so. Its not like the organization or Seagull immediately rushed to deny it neither had to because the fans immediately jumped down his throat. Seagulls lawyer did rush to deny it and in so doing hurt his reputation among people that did know about the situation beforehand but thats a separate issue. Mind you part of the problem is that Thorin got some ancillary details wrong and part of it is that hes not established in Overwatch the way he is in other esports but the core points he made were solid and a lot of the information he revealed has been known to journalists for some time. But that brings up another issue  the people in the Overwatch community that did know enough to back Thorin  other journalists pros casters  almost none of them said anything.

11754985,0,t3_67pw6q,Great guide! I love the format of the video as well. Ive been searching for good content about Orisa.I got back into Overwatch because of Orisas release and I love her kit. Ive played  hours or so on her ingame in Quickplay and Im beginning to get a better feel for her. Shes not good at making flashy plays but she has lots of potential in her kit to create space or draw aggro from the enemy team. Its hard to know what youre doing right when you are doing well.Too often I hear thoughts on Orisa that I feel are just entirely misguided. Shes not a replacement for Reinhardt but that doesnt mean you have to have one. Shes not only effective on maps with drops since thats barely scratching the surface of her Halt is Lucio only picked for his boop?. Shes not weak against dive comp since she is quite good at forcing cooldowns from tracergenji solo survives their ultimates with smart fortify play and is able to force a diving winston off your supports since his damage is positionbased. She isnt only effective on defense on attack the ability to throw a forward shield without risk or pull a defender out of an entrenched position is very valuable and is probably my favorite tank for countering things like a Mei separating the frontline from the backline.All that said I still feel like I havent realized her full potential learned the full subtleties of her matchups nor have I learned how best to pair with my teammates and have them be aware of how to synergize with me. Even if I feel like I have a good grasp of how to play her kit Im still at a loss in how to play her in a teamcomp. I still need to invest more hours into her to learn subtleties and most importantly get expert with leading my targets.I cant believe I didnt think of firing her shield directly up in the air to enable a boost of effective shielding for the next  seconds or so!! I also think Ill take advantage of that training exercise as well.,Competitiveoverwatch,dgsggxy,5,t5_34fcy

11782443,0,t3_680588,I dont know if  the other competitive games are like this but Overwatch is a game where you dont realize how good pro players are until you yourself get better at the game generally. The better you get the more you start to realize the gap between yourself and the pros. When I first started Overwatch and started playing comp I watched some pro streamers and thought jeez I can do what they are doing easily aside from their aim of course. After I improved I started to realize the little things that the pros instinctively were doing gamesense when to engage who to target ult economy knowing where the team is at all times exact moments to use abilities etc and realized how consistently and unerring they were at those plays.Not to be condescending towards lower level players when I play on my lower alt account to play with friends I see SO many mistakes that I would never make now but these lower level players lack the game sense to even realize what they are doing ARE mistakes. The problem seems to be that less skilled players are unaware or unable to realize what they are doing wrong. For an easy exaggerated example a lower skilled player will wait a game and a half by trying to position perfectly for that sick  man deadeye whereas a higher skilled player will maybe pull the trigger right away just to get one ult deadeye for a quick opening pick that allows the team to win the immediate fight quickly and effectively.,Competitiveoverwatch,dgvktii,1,t5_34fcy

11788992,0,t3_685z9b,With the changes to the SR streaks system where a loss is not such a big deal I feel this sort of thing is completely unnecesary and poses a lot of issues that people have already described on this thread. Just take the loss and move on to the next match. In a game where every match is like  to  minutes long a lost match is completely irrelevant.Im going to give some points of why I personally think this wouldnt work. You HAVE to give a certain amount of time for the person who left the game to come back and in a game as fastpaced as this a single minute can mean the difference between a win and a loss. By the time someone fills you could have already lost the game or be close to it and the filler would be faced with a match where he cant do anything. What if the person who fills doesnt wantcant play the role that the leaver was playing? You would have to coordinate with your team to switch roles as necessary which means going back to the spawn and changing accordingly. OR If you make the filler lose no SR for a match loss it would incentivize many people to just mess around or not try hard enough to win especially if the person who fills cant play the character they intended to play or gets forced to play a character they dont like. How would you go about finding a balanced teammate to fill? What if the person who left was a low diamond duoing with a low gold? What if it finds someone whos really good at dps and gets put on a team with bad dps? What if it finds a smurf? The enemy team would feel its unfair to them. What if someone was playing bad and not contributing much to the team? What if someone on the team doesnt like their pick? In this case I think the person would start getting bullied into leaving in the hopes that they are replaced by someone better. Many people would not find enjoyable to queue into a match thats already halfway.  It would cause SR inflation. It would increase queue times.I think many people are not being objective on this issue and are just looking at it from a perspective of someone who lost a match because they had a leaverdc.,Competitiveoverwatch,dgwblfv,8,t5_34fcy

11808642,0,t1_dgxs2xk,Demo from TF was good almost exclusively because of his sticky grenade launcher  junkrat does not have this.  Both because of Demos ability to set extremely effective and wide traps that would kill any hero and because of the ability to firedetonate them midair made him a killing machine.  He could jump in or out at any time and had high clip.  Junkrat doesnt have these things his trap capability is shitty he can only jump oneway and he has a low clip of pipes.  Theres not as much of a comparison as most people seem to think there is.,Competitiveoverwatch,dgyjtvw,1,t5_34fcy
