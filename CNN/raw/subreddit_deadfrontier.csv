11609889,0,t3_65m3rn,This is my current build I run it with Doubleshot aax pistol Corpse Erruptor gl Corpse Destroyer hmg. Keep in mind I have wasted  points in Melee because my character started out as a boxer class using melee and chainsaw. Once I found out how hardcore the Scronom Bunker area was I sold off the melee gear and bought a stat reset for the pistol.Maxing agility should be a priority. If the zeds cant hit you itll be more forgiving to spend stats elsewhere.Critical hits should be followed after that. Every weapon but Shotguns and GL benefits from them I have mine at  mainly for the pistol.Accuracy and reloading will be dependent on what weapon youre running. GL and Pistols  greatly benefit from both. Shotguns to some extent and machineguns from accuracy.weapons.Focus on one proficiency at a time. Primary first melee or your pistol. Playing the endgame recommend pistol end game pistols are better than melee. Rifles are stat friendly compared to pistol but the more powerful shots are slightly more expensive to run.If youre making a pistol your primary you should max it. Youll be spending more money in investing the weapon itself but youll benefit in the long run by needing to buy less ammo and wasting time killing zeds with weaker weapons.Youre secondary can vary since I do not plan on using any other machineguns other than the Corpse Destroyer for economical and financial commitment reasons I only kept it at . Most of the machine guns are pretty meh unless youre planning on boats loads of moneycredits to obtain them so keep that in mind.If youre planning on using Shotguns than maxing it out is reasonable as the maxed level shotguns are reasonably priced for their power. GL generally required the same stats as pistol minus the critical hit requirement. They pair off nicely and cheaper to run than machineguns for grinding. But you wont have the benefit of stunning zeds with critical hits like with shotguns or machinegun. Theyre also mostly shit weapons until level .  ,deadfrontier,dgbzowd,2,t5_2rvly
