1362815,0,t3_29jrpn,First off I approve of your attitude wholeheartedly. Chances are the discussions are spread around a bunch of places so the most complete story is in a devs head.There is much yet to be done on the engine  for a game like this where the vast majority of content is procedurallygenerated the engine is almost all the work. Since we might as well have a comprehensive listing somewhere here goesCurrent state of the engine We can render D models indeed this comes free with OgreD We can do RBD bullet for physics but there are only a few types of entity so far that have physics attached. Whats more for physics we currently sum forces over the flagella around each cell to determine swimming speed. We have our compound system  a resource and reaction model that drives much of our simulation which is gonna be very useful going forward.Recently a lot of the work hasnt been directly enginerelated I think but more for useful boilerplate bugfixes other parts of the game content like organelles code for sound effects etc. There are however some enginerelated things currently in the worksSoonTM A lot was done on D cell membranes a few months ago and methinks work will be picking up again on that. Im currently working on compound clouds and turbulence to finally replace the sounbalanced collectible emitters.The next round of engine upgrades is pretty much the things that are neither easy enough to do in a day or four nor started yet. By this time we probably want to have done some major optimizations moving a lot of code to C from Lua. Later Once the compound clouds are working most likely well probably give the AI an overhaul. Once we can generate D microbe membranes well do some softbody physics making cilia and flagella more realistic wiggling wires and giving microbes squishy surfaces. Different environmental conditions  sunlight availability of compounds etc Well also likely introduce some population management by this point  different species of microbe competition population growth and eventually evolution. Then we reach the things that would probably wait until just before or even just after the final microbe release. Most of it is graphics overhaulingEventually Environmental effects  dust motes floating in the water swimming bacteria cyanobacterial colonies focusing effects custom shaders caustics from the light filtering above... Mostly visual but some gameplay improvements to give the final Microbe release the realistic visual touch were aiming for eventually. Some group behavior and colonization which will serve as the transition out of Microbe Stage.Thats more or less it for Microbe Stage. If Ive missed something important let me know and Ill edit. Now of course thats just Microbe Stage and there are many more stages to list. If youd like me to continue just say so and Ill see what I can pull together.,thrive,cin49qa,5,t5_2stu8

2648232,0,t3_2qa4tw,My storyI joined Thrive around last year and promptly forgot about it because nothing was happening. According to team veterans Thrive has spent much of its life in limbo and even between the phases of limbo there were never too many programmers ie there was usually one programmer whod get frustrated with the uselessness of the rest of the team so there was never too much real work getting done. I returned to Thrive in April or May or so and  Some notes on Parzivals postRodGame and FunnyGames disappeared soon after that post was made on any opensource project loads of new coders do a bit and then leave forever no big deal and then untrustedlife got disappointed and left see a pattern here?. We had another coder Nimbal for some time Im not sure when but he was around for a bit when I first joined but he also left likely for the same reasons. I think the pressure of having to implement such amazing vaporware especially when youre the only programmer so nobody else even understands why some insane feature is so hard to implement is what eventually got to all the previous programmers. Somewhere along the line all the nonprogrammers figured out what was up at least partially I think and we now try not to focus on how demoralizingly vaporwarey Thrive still is and just focus on making one part at a time. So to sum up Manpower problems. Thrive first started without any programmers at all which is really freakin bad and ended up acquiring a massive pile of design documents and a large followingteam of people who didnt code but imagined. Now with a team of  programmers that have been on the team for just about  year each and a codebase that has generally been handed from one pair of programmers to another meaning none of us has been around for the writing of the whole thing you could say Thrive the project is a year old or two. Thrive the idea is much older and has become quite an impressive and fleshedout idea. But Thrive the project is young.,thrive,cn497oc,5,t5_2stu8

3866239,0,t1_cqwz437,Thanks guys.If the organelle originally came from mitochondria then I guess if it was in the game it would be an upgrade to them kind of like how the first slime gland is a repurposed vacuole... Either that or another potential organelle to unlock from plasmids. Maybe both.Not sure what to say about the inputs and outputs... Theres a lot.,thrive,cqwzh62,5,t5_2stu8
4743854,0,t1_ctse4z1,Im not actually talking about camera placement at all. Even if your units in strategy stages are dumb automatons it would be easy to attach a camera to the unit so the player can see through their eyes. What Im talking about is the ability to control one that is to usurp the normal ai which makes the unit move around. ,thrive,ctsia79,3,t5_2stu8

6845144,0,t1_d0s2sxv,I have given it thought but those thoughts were mostly and heres another reason why not.First off an MMO requires a very different architecture even to a multiplayer game. Persistent worlds on servers with players checking in for severalhourlong sessions? Yikes. But lets assume its possible how would it look? The first pressing question from a design point of view is the problem of timescales which throws a wrench in the whole progress through the ages in a world that youve affected through your entire game feeling. Something has to give  either you lose the progression through the ages by having separate servers for various game stages or you lose affecting your world by having players progress through stages by graduating from one server and entering another for the next stage with their same species or you have multiple stages going at once on a planet which I think would just be extremely messy and unworkable.The second option would work pretty well for going from industrial to space and from microbe to multicellular  in each transition a much larger world becomes open for you so it can be reasonable to pretend that your move to a new server still has you sitting in the same universe on the same planet. And I guess it could be possible to have all the strategy stages run at the same pace which might make a history of civilization MMORTS workable though youd still have issues where you either get massive power imbalances or unreasonable metaphorical walls between the powerful and the weak since its probably little fun to play the tribe that gets stomped by the iron boot of progress. In a multicellularaware server that would be less of a problem since youre just one organism of your species and there isnt much of a sense of power creep in the world of evolution  ecosystems always have a large variety of niches and even the powergamiest species would only be able to dominate a few related ones. On such a server you could even simulate the rise and fall of a civilization by say taking a NPC or NPS? NonPlayer Species? relative of one of the most intelligent player species on the planet and have them rapidly build up civilization cause trouble for all sorts of species which have to adapt and then collapse or something and leave ruins which eventually decay. With it all being simulated and not playerrun it could be tuned to work as a temporary special event like most MMOs have.gt and have you discussed it with your team?Not much weve always had plenty of other things to talk about P,thrive,d0s7bwl,1,t5_2stu8
