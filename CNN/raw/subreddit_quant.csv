1551961,0,t3_2byd4q,I couldnt see why it would be. Quants broadly defined are in great demand due to increasing regulation and tighter spreads. You have great math skills including numerical methods an understanding of finance and programming skills. That sounds like a pretty good combination if you want to search for quant jobs. I dont think that  years in another sector means anything really.,quant,cjat8fy,1,t5_2qjt9
1591174,0,t3_2chrev,gt  How reliably do stock markets tend to fit into standard pricing models?Im not even positive precisely what youre referring to but the answer is not well.gt What kind of delays are expected?Some people are successful at all time scales...from microseconds to years. Some types of information affects price very very fast. Some...not so fast.gt What predicts individual variation in those delays?Mainly availability of the information.Some types of information are hard to get a hold of and especiallyhard to process. Other types are conveyed easily and are interpreted easily.gt Do all stocks have at least one algorithm actively trading them?Everything publicly traded with even the smallest hint of liquidity does and probably lots of stuff without liquidity at all.gt Are all stocks reviewed by institutional investors with far more resources than a given startup type lonequant?Yes everything with meaningful liquidity is reviewed by tons of institutional investors. There isnt a lot of money on the table anywhere simply because no one has looked at the instruments.gt It seems finance doesnt have clear trends of academic concensus like the fields most of us come from.Not remotely both because of the nature of the problem and because of the disincentives to sharing on the part of practitioners.,quant,cjfql3n,1,t5_2qjt9

7213363,0,t1_d1xb0z2,Currently taking partial diffeq linear algebra and numerical analysis. Is that enough to understand the text youre thinking of? Or is it more pure like topology real analysis etc.? Thanks for a starting point. Do you think I should be trying to get us on some sort of trading system i.e. quotopian or smtg?,quant,d1y3q8z,1,t5_2qjt9
8827087,0,t3_50ythm,The sample covariance matrix is only an approximation to the true covariance matrix is that right? If so the error in your estimate of the covariance matrix may lead to a large error when you try to solve your ill conditioned system. Am I understanding correctly?,quant,d78w6ap,1,t5_2qjt9
9101374,0,t3_54tzs7,Insert plug about doing PhD in quantitative disciplines like stats or comp sci before considering becoming a quant and only doing PhD for passion for disciplines subject matter and not for being a quant here. ,quant,d85u83q,1,t5_2qjt9
9174560,0,t1_d8evwlh,The best book Ive ever read on stochastic calculus was by Neftci.  Everything pales in comparison!  He was a little bit of a hero for me.Good luck!,quant,d8exyiu,1,t5_2qjt9
