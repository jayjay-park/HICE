3337466,0,t1_cp8mkrz,gtRepeating your statement doesnt make it true. It is exactly the same. Just where do you think Googlethe FBI are getting these child porn images from? Imgur? Do you think theyre all defending the sweet innocence of mainstream websites that just happen to have child porn hosted on them?They are not doing so to keep jailbait forums alive. GoogleFBI are not the modsowners of these forums. Lets make it clear. Taking downunlinkingreporting child porn for the sake of keeping it off the internet in general or potentially catching the perpetrators.. Taking down child porn for the sake of keeping a borderline child porn forum aliveThey are simply not the same. And from the perspective of someone who thinks the borderline child porn is wrong definitely not moral equivalents. Its irrelevant where googleFBI find it. You could argue that google is also likewise immoral to continue indexing jailbait websites as part of their wider service but its still not the same google arent runningmodding those forums and google is not specific to serving jailbait. To restate one last time the point of google finding this child porn is not to keep borderline child porn on the internet its not to protect those websites in question.  Its even less the case for the FBI because theyre not offering any service that can index those sites. The analogy is simply off.gtAnd yet you continue to use the word borderline. So its not illegal. Continuing your pattern of failing to address the argument you miss the point and assume Im stating that jailbait is illegal. Im not. What is immoral is obviously not the same as what is illegal and its irrelevant anyway because my argument was never that its immoral. gtIt just squicks you out. Why are your personal sensibilities more important than others? Why do you consider your personal morality on the level of the law?Man you just dont stop assuming things about me. How have I implied this? where have I talked about morality being above the law? These are literally irrelevant to my assertion that is clearly stated above. gtNo but youre arguing one side which has repeatedly stated that it should have been.Topics arent always a black and white. Just because I agree with someone on one thing doesnt mean I agree with them on other things. I frequently argue with people who would be described as being on my side in a number of topics. This us vs them mentality where if you state an opinion everyone assumes you subscribe to a whole list of semirelated viewpoints is bullshit. Just stick to what has been said instead of assuming. gtWell then go ahead and clear that up. Do you think its immoral or dont you?If its an invasion of privacy then I think its immoral. But otherwise no I dont have strong feelings this way or the other. Guys fapping to pictures of underage girls is generally victimless. An argument might be made if there is evidence that the act of facilitating it sharing it around increases demand and likelihood of real world abuse but its not one im convinced of. So no I dont think its necessarily immoral. I got no idea what youre chatting in that last paragraph. I could go on and on too about how youre not stating anything or failing to address the arguments.. I mean sure I drop some snark here and there but this whole thing you did you got two options disagree and be a fool or agree and admit you were a fool! is just sad rhetoric its a meaningless long effort that doesnt add anything. just stop.,subredditoftheday,cp8p38p,0,t5_2sgno

I guess I sort of was too or I wouldnt have written the damn thing in the first place but it does sort of strip away any need to assume noble intent.Im honestly okay with everything youve written though and Im not going to argue with a word of it.  You misinterpret my intent and positions but thats okay youre not capable of understanding them because youre a subhuman idiotic piece of shit.  I dont resent you for that I dont think its a choice you made.  You be you.I think you represent your community awesomely and you have my upvote.  My problem with this subreddit being featured is strictly that those words the words I wrote and you approved arent in the sidebar on the masthead and in this interview.  TRP should make sure that this is emblazoned on the top of itThe subreddit is written entirely under the belief that women have no brains cannot read and cannot evolve independently.  And thats okay because this subreddit is not for them.As it stands now with that only an implication instead of a banner folks that can read like uZadocPaet can still pretend to be both fans of TRP and not misogynists.

7370950,0,t1_d2fs5bn,gtHomosexuality is a sin against our bodies and against natural order. Its a perverted thing to do. The average gay male has had over  partners  times more than the average heterosexual. Because everyone practicing that is a libertine. God created male and female perfectly so that sex between us is normal healthy and leads to the miracle of life. Sex between homosexuals is nothing like that and leads to lots of diseases. The vast majority of people with HIV in America are homosexuals and many of the women who have HIV have it because of bisexuals. Besides we have a natural aversion towards homosexuality. No culture anywhere in the world ever held it to the same level of heterosexuality. Of course not. The idiots of our generation only think like that due to brainwashing and propaganda.jesus please stop this. youre obviously a man hater ,subredditoftheday,d2g0y9z,10,t5_2sgno

10486748,0,t1_dcwql66,Although the TRPF is a controversial and really hard to prove theory things such as automation as a critique of capitalism and environmental impacts have essentially become part of Marxism. Although it really depends on how you look at Marxism. There are actually two forms of Marxism anyways. Marxist economic ideologies. AKA Bringing about Communism via socialism utilizing the state and Marxian analysis of Economics. You dont need to follow all tenets of Marxian Analysis to see Marxism as an end goal. In fact the TPRF was debated over and over again amongst socialist and by and large was reimagined in Crisis Theory. Typically only orthodox Marxists follow the TRPF because it over simplifies the problem and explains nothing. People Such as Rosa Luxemburg and Lenin made their own versions of the crisis theory which in itself tends to look at the causes and consequences of it however I do not believe it in full because it cannot predict things such as market booms and golden ages like post war America However at the core the system is unstable due to climate change and automation in my eyes. Although both are still marxist at the core. Most of the time they focus of the inherent instability of capital as the market fluctuates it puts lives in the balance. as evident by extreme economic crisis happening damn near constantly even Lenin himself denied that capitalism is doomed to failure. Personally I believe capitalism must  do one thing to ensure its survival. It must limit human advancement. This is because automation as a basis of advancement will eliminate the absolute necessity to work on many things. With a lack of workers no one will pay for products as they have no money. The only argument I see from the capitalist side of this is to bring about the UBI. But as an idea it is flawed. I do not believe the government has the money to pay everyone as the main concentration of money tends towards the hands of the few rich. One true thing that we are seeing of the TRPF is the very clear overproduction in society. Which inevitably lowers profits as goods are being made that do literally nothing like the  billion peoples worth of food that is dumped a year. However this is not enough to stall the rate of profit yet. As they tend to supplement profits by eliminating the requirement of a worker but this way around overproduction will not last forever.,subredditoftheday,dcws63w,1,t5_2sgno

That is however a video serving as a comparison for Apartheid to Modern South Africa that was rather pertinent to the earlier conversation of is the slaughter of Whites in South Africa merited from a modern standpoint your suggestion was yes it was because evil colonialism.
