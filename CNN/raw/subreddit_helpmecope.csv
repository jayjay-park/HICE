2160854,0,t3_2jqhym,Ive recently got a copy of this myself to try I dont find the affirmations useful mainly because they need to be done in a certain way so Ive have read you have to believe them to some truth.  I have noticed Hay doesnt always do that with the ones provided.  So saying I love myself wont work however saying I work on loving myself everyday would work.  Might not of been the best example but hope it helps anyway.  Also its not a case of doing it once and it working you need to work on them daily and not just once a day you may need to repeat the exercise again each time negative thoughts come up.  Really challenge them.  What sort of negative thoughts are you getting?  Is there a theme?I have found the questions useful to do how have you found them?If you dont already I do enjoy visiting her web site for daily affirmations editing accordingly.  ,helpmecope,clehsg4,1,t5_33sjt

2810282,0,t1_cnniiyg,I appreciate your reply but Im sorry to say that most of what you said doesnt apply here.| it didnt even occur to me that sex doesnt have to come with strings attached.Youre welcome to believe that but she and I didnt. She was my first and I was her second but she told me she wished I had been her first. We also were also exclusive for a little over a month before we started having sex. | It sounds like to me that you smothered her. This couldnt be further from the truth. If there was any smothering it was mutual and welcome. All we wanted was to be with each other regardless of what we did. Neither of us had large social circles outside each other anyway.| By and large women like to be treated like regular people. I didnt treat her like a queen either. I treated her like a regular person. A regular person who I loved more than anything and would do anything for. I wasnt her servantdoormat. The only real imbalance was the traveling. I did most of it for the majority of the relationship.,helpmecope,cnniqqt,2,t5_33sjt

And my friends are all macho and if I ask them about my personality they would make fun of me which adds to the problem.,helpmecope,cotcyxl,1,t5_33sjt

Look at you though! Youre trying to find help and a good way to cope one thatll keep you growing and moving and getting better. Thats awesome and Im wicked proud cause that shit can be hard. You should be proud too.Like I said I hope this month has been a good one and if youre looking for someone to yap with just shoot me a PM.,helpmecope,cvtfwyd,1,t5_33sjt

10146307,0,t3_5l9uok,Your situation is quite complicated friend but I may be able to help.  Theres several ways to solve the problems you have here but the one that I think may be the most effective in your situation is talking. I know your brother and mum may seem particularly mad with you at the moment and I dont know everything about your relationship with them but loving them and being loved by them doesnt seem like a lost cause to me. Talk to them. I know it will be hard but it will get you into a more understanding position with them soon enough. The first step to getting there is doing what they wantexpect of you for a bit until they get calmed down a bit. Once they are less heated and the time is right ask them nicely Hey would you mind sitting down and talking with Mr for a bit? Ive been having a hard time recently and need to talk about it. Or something along those lines. Just make sure it is completely nonthreatening in any way. The second step is talking with them. You obviously have problems with what they are doing and they obviously have problems with what you are doing. Starting off the conversation by having them tell you the problems they have with you is the best to start it off. Ive realized recently that youre not too happy with mewhat Im doing. Would you mind helping me understand what Im doing wrong? BY FAR the most important part is listening and accepting that you whether you like it or not are making their life harder  just like theyre making yours. Do not let the conversation get heated. If your brother or mum are starting to get heated let them steam and vent for a bit. And make sure you dont stop listening for one moment. Im truly sorry you are having these problems with me. I will do my best to fix them. After you let them vent and apologize its your turn. Life here recently hasnt been the best for me either. I really hate how we arent having such a loving relationship anymore. I understand the problems with me and I will work on them but can I say a few things that you have done that have hurt me recently? State your problems as politely as possible. Tell them you dont expect them to change. Restate that you want a good relationship with them again and that you miss it. Finish off the conversation by telling them you love them if you have ever loved them before. I know you dont feel that way at the moment but just say it. It will help you get there again. This is the best advice I have for you op. I know first hand that this works on many relationships. Continue to have these conversations and be willing to change. There is a happy ground for everyone here. If you dont have these conversations the anger will build up in all of you until you lash out like your brother did. I believe in you OP. I know I dont know everything about your situation but regardless this should work. Believe in them believe in yourself. You got this.,helpmecope,dbu2f4s,2,t5_33sjt
10773261,0,t1_ddr4tgu,Mindfulness meditation is a practice thats all about being. Its about learning to be in the moment to sit with ones thoughts and to bring them back to the present moment if they start to wander. You could google it and see if you get anything useful. I watched a DVD about mindfulness that I purchased online. What I found most useful wasPractising onemindfully. Weird name but its useful when youre constantly battling negative thoughts and cant seem to control them. The concept is to live in the moment focus on the now. For example if youre eating just eat. If youre going to sleep go to sleep. If youre watching a movie you just watch the movie. You essentially practice doing only one thing at a time. Focussing on it and not thinking about anything other than what youre doing at the present moment. The three reasons its helpful are it is more efficient to do than multitask allows you to live life to the fullest and because life causes enough suffering thinking about the past or worrying about the future that your present doesnt need to suffer as well. I found this practice to be the most helpful for me. Not sure if it will work for you or anyone else but thought I would share anyways. ,helpmecope,ddr6mbg,1,t5_33sjt
11144086,0,t3_5kqk2o,Ive been in your shoes before.Spoiler I was an arrogant prick. Occasionally drinking is normal. Of course there are limits and there is a point where it becomes problematic but getting drunk with friends on the weekends is  absolutely OK. I get why you would hate smoking and drinking. I did because the people I hated used to smoke and drink. You need to realize that those things are perfectly fine if done in moderation. You should try having a beer for youself and see what its actually like. Though you dont have to try smoking. Its really just a bad habit.When you have low self esteem and arnt the most social person it feels good to get on a high horse and judge people from moral highground but you should probably not do it. Its a bad habit as well.Just live and let live. Enjoy each others company. Try and get along with the people around you and try to make them feel good about themselves instead of shaming them for petty smokingdrinking. Youll find that they will treat you much better in return.Hope I could help.,helpmecope,dev658j,2,t5_33sjt
11634625,0,t3_62wdsl,Hi. I came on this thread for the same reason. I hope you are doing a bit better losing a parent is something I wouldnt wish upon my worst enemy. My mom died suddenly when I was  years old. I wish I could tell you that one day you will feel better about all of this but unfortunately that isnt how grief works. However I can tell you that it gets better. Its been  years since my mom died and while I do still have my awful days I am able to function and am happy most of the time. Right now you may not feel that way but I can promise that one day you will.Over the years I found better ways to cope with the grief when it becomes unmanageable. I was too young to do this but its a good idea to write down any happy memories you shared with her one day you may forget those happy times and when you have a bad day it is nice to have these memories. I dont remember much about my mom except for a few select memories and her last days in the hospital. She wrote my sister and I each a journal which helps. It contains those fond memories that I have since forgotten. Home videos are also a good option for this reason. I dont know if you practice any religion but I still believe my mom is watching me. Even if this sounds dumb it has been a huge comfort for me to believe this as I still talk to her and call her my guardian angel. When I am having a bad day I try and remind myself that she doesnt want me to be sad for her and that she is still with me even if I cant see her. Talking to family members is one of the most important things you can do. They are feeling the same way you do and even though the wound is still fresh nothing helps more than talking to someone who truly understands how you feel. These are the people who wont tell you that shes in a better place or its going to be okay which Im sure you have gotten a lot of. Odds are that your family will have some funny stories about her that you didnt know about. My family has been the most helpful tool during my grieving process. Give yourself time to grieve. The process never ends but I promise that it does improve. The feelings of helplessness and loneliness will eventually fade you can get through this and people will admire your strength for doing so. Sending love your way,helpmecope,dgespwc,2,t5_33sjt
