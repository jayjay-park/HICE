5056759,0,t1_cuvinv9,Generally people who have a high break around  are decent at potting single balls but not so great at position. So probably you should work on your positional play. For doing this you have a few choices Put YGB on baulk spots in their usual places and pot them in the right order as many times in a row as you can respot them once all three are down and dont move the white from where it ends up off the brown. To get past the break mark you probably want to be able to do this whole sequence  times in a row without many attempts. Blue on its spot red on pink spot couple more reds either side of it so you have  in total. Pot a red in the corner and play for position HIGH I cant stress this part enough on the blue then go back down for a red and continue. Colours clearance with no cushions allowed. This is a lot more difficult than it sounds and will really punish you for positional lapses. If you master this one try then playing from the black back up for the yellow again with no cushions and respot the balls to repeat the exercise. Ive never managed this three times in a row myself  difficult for sure.One general tip as well is to stop using side. This is probably the biggest problem with clublevel players everyone thinks its really cool to use side so people pick it up and use it a ton themselves. Side spin is a pain in the ass and throws the white ball off course even before it hits the object ball. If a shot can be hit without sidespin to attain position using followstunback do this instead. At pro level were playing less than  of shots with side I reckon and thats usually only if we messed up our position  .As for the best Ive played I dunno  all players have their good points and bad points even the top  are doing a lot of things incorrectly. Im going to be diplomatic on this one I think  its difficult to choose just one best. One guy I was really impressed by was Peter Ebdon  as a Ronnie fan myself I didnt rate his style of play that highly until I played him not in an official tournament  but holy cow if he played the sort of style he plays casually when hes on TV hed be a lot more popular some of the shots he can play are amazing and such a far cry from the way of play he is known for.,snooker,cuvj3u7,3,t5_2rljx

Although I do feel a little bad for Hawkins not being able to take advantage of a poor playing Higgins.I expect not many people feel the same but I love a slow matchframe as much as I love quick fluent potting and even though this isnt the kind of slow match we are use to I still find it fascinating. Theres lucky snookers unlucky kisses or bounces terrible break offs and of course Ooh and thats a bad miss.
