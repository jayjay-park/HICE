11023566,0,t3_5x7sts,Should I move to HK? Im a university professor and am pretty comfortable where I am Canada but have been offered a job at an objectively better school in Hong Kong. It comes with more money just over  million HKDyear   MPF and less teaching than I currently have.Im relatively young male and dont have family. Ive lived all over the world including Asian countries before  but never HK. Ive visited a few times but thats it.  Whats life like there? Are there any things I should be taking into consideration that I may not be aware of?,MellowHongKong,dehhp0z,2,t5_3ewxg
