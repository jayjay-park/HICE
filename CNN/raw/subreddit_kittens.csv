4791648,0,t3_3ggp1r,Shes adorable! I would be very careful with that collar though. I believe its a breakaway it looks like the exact same thing we have on our kitten but Artemis looks too weak to be able to break the collar in case it gets caught on something and that could end very badly! Also the collar looks very big on her increasing the chance of it getting caught on something or worse she getting tangled up in it herself. So please watch out I would personally wait a couple of weeks before giving her a collar. ,kittens,ctyiyet,2,t5_2qn3z

7358112,0,t1_d2e48qo,Since youre feeding her she wont need to go out hunting as much so she can stay by the babies more now.  Her behavior says shes protective of them so the brief contact you had with them hasnt put her off caring for them so she should be able to keep them safe and healthy for now.  Make sure she has clean fresh water around at all times and peaceful places to retreat to and just keep an eye out for her.  Shell move them if she thinks her current nest is bad for them or your nest is better.,kittens,d2ekf9w,1,t5_2qn3z

Airports are good in basketball and you will win a great big trophy as big as me! And youll ball till the day you allow a national tragedy to occur.
