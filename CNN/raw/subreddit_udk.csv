168133,0,t3_1w0b6l,If youre looking for aid in creating the point and click systems I would recommend the MOBA Starter development kit for UDK.  There should be plenty of code you can use as a reference for your own project thereCameraControl Systems.  Whats available in the MOBA kit should be a great resource and easily customizable to your liking.  There is also an RTS development kit gem you can use for reference code in case you need additional functionality of multiple pawn control.    ,udk,cexl0pk,3,t5_2rbte

2297668,0,t3_2lkt6l,Hey there! Ive had a similar problem  a single mesh always ALWAYS crashing your editor?I checked out the crash dump and it said from what i can gather that there was an exception thrown in UVLayout.cpp.  I went back into Max applied a Normal modifier ticked Unified and converted back to an editable poly and it imported just fine.Im guessing somewhere along the line one of the norms had gotten flipped through one way or another and the automatic unwrap tool in UE was having trouble creating a UV Layout for it hence the thrown exception.I hope this helps! If you come across another solution dont forget to post it helps the community grow D Good luck!,udk,clvph2g,4,t5_2rbte
