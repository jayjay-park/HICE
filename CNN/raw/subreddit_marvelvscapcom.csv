10067843,0,t1_dbjnilj,As long as people keep buying DLC the industry isnt going anywhere what made you think that would change?Besides whats wrong with a complete game of  characters with DLC? You know how many people bought UMvC late and asked for jillshuma? We may have had people ask for them once a week in rmvc before the PS release. People like DLC and buy it so capcom will keep making it. Unless we get a bait and switch the MvCI devs said they want to release a complete game this time in response to SFV.It doesnt bother me if it means we get DLC of xmenF then I couldnt be happier.,marvelvscapcom,dbjv2sw,2,t5_2vt4j

11756902,0,t1_dgskalk,Yeah Capcom games are probably going to follow the SFV model for a while because although the game had negative press and bad initial sales the player base has been constant and people keep buying the DLC. Selling DLC instead of a full game leads to greater profit because there is no overhead from making a disk based game that may go down in price over time.,marvelvscapcom,dgsoamt,1,t5_2vt4j
