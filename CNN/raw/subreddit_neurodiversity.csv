983647,0,t1_cheuww5,The word rapey was extremely poor word choice on my part. I had just come from a lecture about the history of the hysteria diagnosis and how doctors use to prescribe marriage masturbation andor exorcisms in order to get women to stop exhibiting hysterical behavior. The diagnosis was usually made by a male Westerneducated doctor amp the woman didnt get a say in how she was diagnosed and in fact the hysteria diagnosis was sometimes used as a way to silence female troublemakers so that they wouldnt be taken seriously. In cases where the woman was prescribed a marriage or a masturbation session that she didnt want we are literally talking about rape being framed as a medical treatment.Heres a couple of links to articles on that. One academic  and one not  So that was what was on my mind while I was posting that comment. For the record I do not think medical interventions are tantamount to rape but it still makes me uncomfortable that certain groups of people like Westerneducated doctors have the power to force other groups of people the mentally ill and mentally disabled to ingest mindaltering medications without the patients consent. I have enormous respect for doctors dedication and expertise but we should be able to have serious indepth conversations about Who has the power to make a diagnosis? Why is Xbehavior considered a medical problem while Ybehavior isnt? Who decides when an intervention becomes absolutely necessary? and If the patient doesnt want to be medicatedintervened upon shouldnt that be taken into account?I believe that everyone should have a say about what drugs go into their own bodies regardless of whether they have a neurological disorder. And as for the PS I would agree that I am both unrequited and vain and that it would be silly to blame those on my ADHD but Im also a biological determinist. I believe that my vanity is a function of my neural wiring and so are all of my other personality traits. So if Im exceptionally vain or bad at dealing with unrequited feelings whos to say that my neurological makeup has nothing to do with that? ADHD is a behavioral category. I dont know biologically whats going on in my brain. Does the same neurological abnormality underly both my inattentiveness and my vanity? I have no idea...but Im pretty sure you dont either.,neurodiversity,chg3k5g,1,t5_2tzqe

1862002,0,t1_ckcrx1v, Thats just the thing though. When they talk about connectivity theyre referring to the structure of white matter tracts. Thats a physical difference when they say less connectivity they mean literally fewer or less intact structural connections and measuring things in flux does imply a physically different brain when youre doing a dMRI. Were talking about mapping the diffusion of water molecules which depends  on physical structure not on neuronal activity diffusion of water doesnt have anything to do with what the brain is doing and not about measuring variable  blood flow and activation.. Again the connectivity is physical. Differences in connection are physical differences. Less connectivity means the white matter tracts are smaller or set up weirdly or something Im not a neurologist. This research is helping to redress that problem here. Theyre showing that certain observed  physical differences in the brain again this type of brain scan does not depend on feelings and behaviour are strongly related to certain asyet behaviourally defined disorders. Well then what is a disorder? Its subjective. If we assume that gay mens brains are indeed somewhat different probable the only reason its no longer in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is that society mostly no longer views homosexuality as pathological. On the other hand autism also almost definitely a brain difference is mostly considered pathological and is therefore a disorder. What makes one difference a disorder and one not a disorder? A disorder is just what the medical community calls a difference that people consider wrongharmful.,neurodiversity,ckdkdu0,2,t5_2tzqe

3814115,0,t1_cqqn2sg,I was put in gifted classes in elementary and middle school and it hurt much more than it helped. I grew up believing that if I had to work at anything or if I got less than an A it had to mean I was stupid or awful at something. When mainstreamed students get a B its above average. When gifted students get an A its meeting expectations.There was also the issue that for third through sixth grade my gifted classes were more or less the same  or so kids every year. So not only was the class oversized most of the other classes were  kids but after a couple of years we were all sick of each other. I was the target of the class and there was no way to get out of that situation short of switching to a mainstream class that would have bored me to death.So yeah. Gifted classes may seem good on the surface but they just suck.,neurodiversity,cqr1g7n,2,t5_2tzqe

4651367,0,t1_ct81yq4,gtbut if I was bipolar and an adult I could still be forced to take drugs I dont want if I was judged to be dangerous.Speaking as an adult bipolar you dont have to take any drugs you dont want. The only time you are ever going to be forced to take medication is if you are an extreme risk to yourself or another person such as being in an extreme psychotic state. Even then if you can somehow play it cool you can fake it till you make it out of the hospital without being forced on any medication especially if you have an advocate with you like a partner or family member.Ive been hospitalized against my will and willingly.

Because thats what psychiatrists have defined schizophrenia as.I think the vast majority of people accused of schizophrenia do not think theyre delusional.If you have sensory errors etc then IMO you should find a new label and not call yourself schizophrenic.There should be new labels eg if someone is overly emotional in some way or has sensory errors which reflect that without namecalling.,neurodiversity,d0qi782,2,t5_2tzqe
6832344,0,t1_d0o7z2u,I should have made that first part of my second point say I dont think theres any wrong way to refer to the way someone is PROVIDED THEY CHOOSE THE LABEL. Youre absolutely right about pathologization and selfidentification though. I caught my oversight after clicking Reply already P I agree that there is a social construction to all of our problems and the DSM does assume a set of values that are oppressive. Id caution against saying that NO ONE can use any diagnostic term without us though. While it is certainly preferable for psychologists to respect our identifications how are we supposed to get those identifications to begin with? As well having trained professionals able to indicate potential pitfalls a person may face in life is immensely valuable. The problem is when said professionals use language and professional standards that pathologize. We can all agree that pathologization is so totally wrong on so many levels. I think psychology as a discipline needs to move towards more inclusive accepting language and away from clinical and oppressive terms and patterns of professional thought. There is nothing wrong with us as you said and when our atypical brain wiring does cause a clash with society? Id like my psychological professionals to help me deal not tell me how broken I am.Anyway just my little rant. I always look forward to your insightful comments AccountHaver ,neurodiversity,d0qqwaf,2,t5_2tzqe
6837462,0,t1_d0qxpxf,gt Not to say PFL doesnt exist outside the disabled community it does! but nobody insists on it like in the disabled community.thats kind of an interesting question about whether people do it outside of the disability context.  I think you might analogize it to gender and race?  I think these are attributes which become offensive when people needlessly emphasize them and so the whole people first thing kind of started with this idea that people shouldnt be defined by only that ONE attribute when everyone has so many.I grew up in the South so I have heard people talk about the Blacks before in a way that was decidedly not nice.  And people also have this way sometimes of emphasizing race in a context where it should be irrelevant so you can just kind of feel the racism I guess.Ive definitely heard people mention that someone was Black countless of times when it was completely irrelevant to the story or situation at hand.  This black guy came in and blah blah blah.  Really?  was it important that the dude was black??  You can also substitute this gay guy.With gender I also see people including gender information when it really shouldnt be relevant.  so heres one of my pet peeves  I happen to be a woman and also a lawyer and i really dont like it when people talk about lady lawyers.  It just implies that somehow it was relevant that the lawyer was a woman.  And somehow it always seems like they are implying there is something special about women who are lawyers.  Ill be honest Im not always exactly sure what that is but I dont like it!Im not really the kind of person to get all bent out of shape over stuff like that so I have a friend who says this all the time and I dont hate him!  But I call him on it.  Sadly he totally never gets it he thinks its normal.  I just gave up but I still find it annoying when he does it. It just rubs me the wrong way.I think I can also understand other ways when people emphasize aspects that just really shouldnt matter.  I mean Im also very short all the time.  But I dont really like to be called Shorty.Looking back to the s when I was growing up and I really remember being taught to use person first language in various contexts it was really all about acknowledging that whatever that one trait is it isnt the only thing that matters about the person whether its race gender disability or whatever else.  Nationality might fit in there too.  I think about the way when I was a kid my grandfather would talk about Japs.  Not very nice.  Nothing inherently wrong with calling someone Japanese when they ARE yet theres something about boxing people in like that that almost always meant prejudice.That doesnt mean I dont support your right to use identity first language I really like the concept.  ,neurodiversity,d0rbuuw,2,t5_2tzqe
8729193,0,t1_d6pflmy,I disagree. Calling it treatment means thinking of it as a disease. To many of us it is not just a way of being different. Basically these accommodations should be seen as a way of being modifying behavior directed toward us that is consistent with how we best function the same way we are expected to change OUR behavior when we direct it towards NTs.,neurodiversity,d6wsk16,1,t5_2tzqe
