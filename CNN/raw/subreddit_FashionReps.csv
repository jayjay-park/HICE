If youre really nitpicky though there are often some telltale differences. I bought a silk bomber and everythings basically perfect including the quality on the silk but the sleeves cuffs design just change halfway through. Dont really know why since that basically requires more work on their part but the legit one doesnt have that change. The silk bomber costs over a  though so at an  discount Im not complaining about some weird cuffs.Also they only have FOG tags so these will have a generic puerhomme tag.Btw end clothing is having a  off sale on select items code spring. You can check if it applies to the selo bomber.,FashionReps,d2cl4lq,1,t5_31hcv

I dont understand what advantage David has. Hes not being shoved down anyones throat and in fact he gets shit talked daily.    Also Davids th batch was already announced before Helen even appeared. Its not like Helen is even serious competition because if you can QC for shit you can see that while the pattern on the front is good everything else is off including the God damn shape of the shoe.    There isnt some conspiracy on here or RS no one is getting paid in magical DavidBucks. You think the admins havent already talked to us about Aidens accusations?

7596829,0,t3_4jdhrc,They dont exist as far as my knowledge. Been looking for a while the reps arent bad but the leather is a lot cheaper and the shape is kinda weird on foot. Also the all blacks and all whites have the wrong faces with having Stan on both tongues. So theres no s and the reps they do make are pretty meh in quality.If youre still looking for something in that same silhouette that you can flex in Id look at the Common Projects on Puerhomme. Theyre  but the leather quality is fantastic and PH is known for being real sticklers and getting their stuff to the  or at least SMP level. ,FashionReps,d35pyw1,3,t5_31hcv

Anita I am mostly familiar with her higher quality models but they are usually very very good. Was actually thinking about buying a Keepall  from her next because she has showed me some QC pics and they look really good.I have a  from FangFang in Ebene and a real one in Graphite and FangFangs is so close its crazy but that was an older model so Im sure the current ones from Anita are also very good. ,FashionReps,d6dlhdb,1,t5_31hcv

8842881,0,t1_d7arq5p,Counterfeit clothing is basically stealing other peoples designs and are illegally recreating it without the owners permission. The intellectual has been stolen and the brand has both been undermined as there is now fakes of it but also they have lost on potential revenue. If people start buying reps instead of retail they could lose out on a lot of money but also if they are struggling to generate enough sales it could result in prices being increased depending on the brand. Also you discuss saying you wouldnt pay retail for a givenchy tee even if you hadnt you would of ending up buying branded tee anyways such as carhatt or something similarly priced. The money which you have spent on a rep has been taking out of the industry as a whole as you have purchased a rep. its the same argument as pirating music and software just because everyone does it and there is no real punishment you are still stealing even though you may feel like you are not as you physically havent taken someones property from them. If anything were just online thieves without us reps might not of existed on this scale as the demand wouldnt of been there so technically because of us reps are being made and improved. Great to see such as a humble response   ,FashionReps,d7asens,4,t5_31hcv

I have also had several packages opened with EMS but only once with DHL and that was like a kg package. So Im really not sure if I should go with what people are saying here on this sub or my personal experience. Im sure every DHL hub is very different so you cant really say that EMS is safer than DHL if youre outside of the US. DHL is also both cheaper and faster so I think Im gonna go for it instead of EMS.,FashionReps,d8722tp,2,t5_31hcv

9653911,0,t1_da308n4,Depends on what youre using. My current stack does make a noticeable difference in how I think and work but its not like theres an intelligence pill or anything out there that flips you from meh to a genius and apart from stimulants and eugeroics you probably wont get a feeling like a body high or anything. You can just generally get improvements in areas. If you dont like public speaking some phenibut can lower your anxiety and a racetam with some choline supplementation will improve your memory over time and so you can give a big public presentation that you wouldnt have been able to before. And unlike fiction its lot like you lose all the benefits of nootropics if you stop using them. Stuff that promotes memory can give you longlasting improvements and even shortterm boosts can improve your confidence and help you meet tight deadlines or help you do things you wouldnt have before.Theres a general trend of newbies in the nootropics community taking their first noots and going oh wow this is awesome I can feel myself getting smarter but scientifically its not that dramatic. The older members of the community generally also promote eating healthy getting good sleep exercising etc. for best effects. Basically being the best you can be and then pushing yourself to go beyond that.,FashionReps,da31n3u,9,t5_31hcv

10485804,0,t1_dcwbcw9,I actually dont think or maybe at least hope so. In my opinion this is rather because of the hype his bogos recently got so hethe company he buys from had to work faster to produce more and there probably is not enough time to do real quality control like it was with UNHS when they did not manage to print their box logo shirts straight. I guess one still has to put the blank hoodie on the sewing machine by hand and if one tries to do maybe some hundreds of hoodies per day as fast as one can and probably also produce other stuff in the same factory one might easily make dumb mistakes like that...Nevertheless this is not acceptable at all in my opinion  I am very interested what TC will tell us about this.,FashionReps,dcwob6n,3,t5_31hcv

Plus cdg is fairly more accessible and affordable so people wont be sus and all up in ur business. E also the heart really isnt that noticeable unless your staring closely at it. The biggest giveaway from afar is probably the collar if you get stripped. I think youd be fairly safe wearing it out.

10838706,0,t1_ddxwq28, In my opinion you have to dress it as if it a normal hoodie so that people think its normal for you to buy such a hoodie. You need to make it look easy Its a woman but still. The fits were you wear just pieces that are expensive  and where people can notice the brand just works for rappers or celebs. Edit thats just my opinion though you can also wear it like this if you want,FashionReps,ddxxp0x,3,t5_31hcv

They have their own employees checking the packages and obviously they dont give a fuck if you have replica yeezy or  gucci in your haul. If you declare the value under the import tax of your country they will not check it. With other companies like EMS customs will check everything that looks suspicious. ,FashionReps,deuhpt3,9,t5_31hcv

11771026,0,t3_67w1sj,I just got this exact one and its awesome for like . There are three problems though. The sizes are fucking ridiculous! Im glad I ordered an XL because it fits like a nonoversizee M on me cm kg so I hope youre a small person or you should exchange it. Also the fabric is very cozy though seems like the standard hoodie fabric that loses  of its softness after one wash but it has absolute zero elasticity which is kinda weird especially when putting it on as it seems tiny when you barely can get your head through the neckhole because it doesnt stretch at all. The third problem is something Ive found with pretty much all hoodies on Taobao the actual hood is pretty small. I guess most factories doesnt size up the hood when sizing up the rest of the hoodie. I have a pretty large head maybe but there is no way I can use the hood as it just looks fucking weird with the top of the hoodie kind of stretching upwards. But I mean for  its a steal the stitching and tags and everything is great!,FashionReps,dgu9znd,2,t5_31hcv

11789642,0,t1_dgwe4t2,ok if we are being serious we buy streetwear for guys tbh girls may say a walmart shirt u spent  on is lit asfuck bc they vibe with it but guys will notice that  bogo on got on. IMO its fucking hot when a girl knows her streetwear but im yet to meet onedesigner shit is amazing for getting girls but in HS it makes u look like a douche with too much money and there r a lot of gold diggers looking to make a pretty pennyTLDR i want a nice streetwear girl thats easy on the eyes and not a gold digger D,FashionReps,dgwe92p,3,t5_31hcv
