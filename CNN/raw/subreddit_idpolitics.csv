4479154,0,t3_3cb0w0,I was warning people before and during the campaign our Labour complete failure to address the immigration issue would bite us in the ass. While we did adopt a somewhat soft stance on it acknowledging it midway in it didnt go far enough. The fundamental problem is that like it or not high immigration levels are concerning a lot of the traditional working class vote. Its exacerbating the housing shortage that the Tories pretend doesnt even exist undermining wages and unionisation and contributing to British locals being out of the job a lot of the time. Only under Brown were wildcat strikers walking out holding signs reading British Jobs for British Workers in solidarity with the controversial and muchmaligned statement made by the Prime Minister. This alone shouldve been enough to gauge where we should be taking the party on this issue not lecturing down to them about the unproved economic benefits of immigration and how theyre all racist bigots. This is the same reason no other party can tackle it because UKIP wont create the job training programs and state support to train British workers to do the jobs imported workers can no longer do and the Tories just pretend none of these local problems even exist to begin with.,idpolitics,csv9kic,2,t5_37gbc
