6261753,0,t1_cz16ipq,So I just recently started up my game again to see if I could fix the crashing but this time I started the game through my steam library and chose to startup straight to GTA Online. The game began starting by doing a first time setup through steam saying it was installing the game. It worked for a decent period of time but then I decided to change to windowed borderless it started in windowed mode then my game froze and I was forced to restart my pc as I couldnt tab out of it. Once I restarted I tried the same thing again this time I did not get the first time setup message and now the stuttering is happening again. Anyway I just figured this would be some pretty helpful info seems to me that the first time setup is likely the reason it started working again.,HalfOfAKebab,cz1e4el,2,t5_3ahcj
