598051,0,t1_cg7xvct,Those types of areas existed awhile ago but the for the last couple decades Toronto has been redeveloping its industrial land and a large portion of the artist communes in Toronto have been converted to condos. If you can find a place to sublet or a room to rent for a few months youll find more listings in the summer since that is when the lower end of the rental market tends to move since they often enter the lease cycle at that time.Your best bet may be looking along the rail corridor heading northwest out of the core. There are still livework spaces located within some of the remaining light industrial areas although they often arent listed online. There are also some spaces that you can find along the rail corridor north of Dupont and in the area by Laird and Eglinton. This unfortunately means a lot of walking and Ive found sometimes it is difficult to rent in some of the remaining buildings without a reference from a current tenant but they are usually cheaper than units listed online.,TorontoRenting,cg8931b,1,t5_2sp5h

I would also refuse entry without hr notice from here until you move out.Edit you are also in no way responsible for keeping the place presentable for potential buyers. The only thing you are responsible for is damages to the property that werent there when you moved in. That can only be assessed after you vacate for purposes of a civil claim. If he is unable to sell that does not concern you in the least. Do you have a copy of the leasetenancy agreement?,TorontoRenting,cpn4ody,3,t5_2sp5h
5403093,0,t3_3p0ser,See if you can find someone to sublet your room to or do a lease assignment with. For a sublet you become the landlord and are still responsible for the condition of the room and any missed rent payments if the person that you sublet to is a jerk who doesnt pay this is why it helps to be as thorough as you can in terms of vetting the person if you go this route.With a lease assignment you transfer the remaining lease length and all payment responsibility to a new person the landlords contract with you is over and the new tenant assumes your role. This would be the best option for your peace of mind. All of this being said your landlord has to either approve the sublet or lease reassignment. These would be the only two ways to legally break the lease.,TorontoRenting,cw2azn0,1,t5_2sp5h

8969852,0,t1_d7pz1d0,if you get a place thats on the subway line your commute will be much faster than if you were to take say the streetcar but even then there are frequent delays on the subway during rush hour.  Personally I like the area around Bloor and Bathurst  there are lots of houses and apartment buildings and theres a diverse range of businesses.  Its a bit bohemian in places but definitely has character.Theres also Yorkville which is just north of Bloor to around Avenue Road  thats pretty upscale but you might find something nice there and depending on where you actually end up if youre working at yonge and bloor you could walk on a nice day though it would be more like a  minute walk.  Maybe check out sites like viewit . ca and kijiji  there are condos going up in the downtown all the time and you might find someone whos using theirs as income property and condo buildings will almost always have everything youre looking for but at a price.  Parking I dont know so much about  I dont drive and Ive lived in the city for  years and Ive never needed a car.  With all the bike lanes being put in place cycling is a nice option when the weathers nice.  Having said all that I recommend speaking with a realtor  you dont pay them the landlords do and they do all the legwork and will find as much as they can based on your criteria.  I know several people whove gone with a realtor and they said it was a lot less stressful than doing it on their own.,TorontoRenting,d7q1ggo,1,t5_2sp5h

9237638,0,t3_56vuyy,its funny  this morning when i got up my apartment was legitimately freezing and since the office was closed because of thanks giving i knew that i coudlnt ask anyone till tomorrow.  Tonight however there were really insane banging noises coming from under my apartment nobody lives beneath me  insane enough that the mediocre horror film I was watching became too scary and i had to pause.  I guess that must have been the pipesfurnace stretching after being turned on because the radiator in the bathroom was so hot I burned myself when i brushed against it.tldr some folks say November  some say October .  For me it was October .,TorontoRenting,d8mxsnl,4,t5_2sp5h

Otherwise look a little west along the streetcar line on lakeshorequeensway you can probably find some in your price range. If you dont want a room mate or basement this could get tricky.,TorontoRenting,dc73b16,2,t5_2sp5h
