184331,0,t1_cezesox,LoadedQ.  Say the input impedance of you receiver is kohms and you connect it directly across your parallel LC tank.  Youre loading down the Q factor.  If you connect to it with a stepdown transformer which is what the coupling coil is you load Q down by a lot less since the input impedance seen by the LC tank will be  n k n being the ratio of turns between the main coil and coupling coil,rfelectronics,cezfkwo,3,t5_2s9fi

366532,0,t1_cfi2b2h,Solid is good. The pros use silverfilled vias under the device because its a simpler process than what youre doing  think stuff with silver solder paste and reflow  but yours will work equally well. The key to reducing inductance is more vias. If you drill more holes  smaller ones  thats good. The total inductance is the inductance of one via divided by the number you have. And clearly thinner dielectric means less via inductance but then the problem becomes thinner traces for the same impedance which requires more accurate etching to get accurate impedance.You can get silver epoxy if you dont want to mess with an oven but it is also messy. Silverconductive ink is another good product which allows you to tune microstrip filters after etching. The other way is to scrape off copper with a razor blade but what to do when youve scraped too much? Geez youd think I was a shill for big silver but really Im just a satisfied customer.,rfelectronics,cfir8h4,1,t5_2s9fi
382315,0,t3_1yfxzc,Im a nooby undergrad so bear with me. Ive had some experience with HFSS and antenna design so Ill try to answer your questions. . Try the second link here.. Ive played with HFSS a little but not so much UWBs so to me my first impression is that the results look a little too good to be true. Id need to do more research on UWB antennas. . A circular groundplane is quite common but its interesting to see a partial one. . Your VSWR is below . for the majority of the bandwidth so no. But you may have changes in the real model so it might be necessary to add quarter wave stubs after testing the real thing. . I dont think that size is too large. I mean it is large in terms of GHz antennas but the only way to verify a model is to experiment in the real world. ,rfelectronics,cfke4lo,2,t5_2s9fi

584266,0,t1_cg6nc6n,I like AWR. It was a little overwhelming at first but it allows me to do pretty complete simulations on designs in RF. Im reasonably new to the program so I havent tried to do anything incredibly complex just yet. AWR is a pretty expensive program though so I imagine only companies who really need it will have a license.My company designs and manufactures mostly attenuators and terminations with lots of other side stuff like splitters phase shifters etc. Im just a BSEE graduated Dec.  I might try to hit of Grad school in the next year or so tuition reimbursement!I personally work in a division of engineering dedicated to custom test solutions. Instead of just selling the individual parts our company makes to a customer we build entire boxes based on what the customer wants. Most of my work is testing those systems writing the procedures to test them and verifying the work done on repairs. Im now starting to get into component design. Its a smallish company so I assume within a year or so Ill be helping design the boxes too. There are only  engineers in my department.

2158132,0,t3_2jmdn9,To echo ujpdoane and provide a bit more infoThe antenna gain should be different depending on the orientation you consider horizontal or vertical. So assuming your radio antenna is vpolarized your vertical polarization copolarization gain should be higher than your horizontal crosspolarization gain. Do you have both of these specs for your Tx antenna?The gain numbers you use in this formula for ERP should be relative to an ideal halfwave dipole with gain of .dBi. For example if your radio antenna has a vertical pol. gain of .dBi then the GtdBd  .dBi  .dBi  .dBd. Same idea for the horizontal polarization. The unit dBd just means the gain is referenced to an ideal dipole.See pages  and  of this FCC doc for further info,rfelectronics,cle5c3k,1,t5_2s9fi

4306775,0,t1_csawxdu,Without an impedance analyzer there are various ways to find inductance with the help of an oscilloscope see for example this Tektronix app noteIdeally you will test directly at your target frequency because the coil is not a pure series LR circuit it has various parasitic capacitances and possibly a frequency dependent resistance due to skin effect or dielectric loss.But if you get a close enough measurement and make a tunable matching circuit you can fine tune your impedance match,rfelectronics,csb3ktp,1,t5_2s9fi

5758728,0,t3_3u09my,A  degree hybrid eg ATMs HKa  will split one input signal into two quadrature signals that are  degrees out of phase with each other. You can then feed those into the two antenna inputs to get a CP signal. Youll need to make sure the cables from the hybrid to the antenna inputs are wellmatched in length since small differences in length will make a large difference in phase at that frequency. As uReversedGif said youll probably have trouble getting really good axial ratio without some kind of integrated component in the antenna such as a sloped septum polarizer.,rfelectronics,cxaxauq,4,t5_2s9fi

Stick it between two boards and pop it in the oven for a while. Seems crazy but thats what he said. No idea about temps or times though nor the Dk of the plasticIf you are making stripline you also have to worry about good grounding and preventing parallel plate modes too.

7401089,0,t1_d2iw29y,Hmm... I also was a bit worried about the sudden change in measurements. If I cant get stable measurements of return loss then its hard to take any single measurement seriously. One issue I think I may have had is that I was driving the antenna straight off my tracking generator via the directional coupler. By chance I came across one of WAEWs videos in which he mentions that its common to put a  dB pad in there to make sure that when the antenna acts as a short it doesnt disturb the TG. I added the pad and retested with RG cables in place but havent tried other configurations to make sure the measurement is stable.What kind of characterizations would you do to check that e.g. the cables and directional coupler are working properly?I dont have access to serious antenna modeling software unfortunately but I wonder if I can get NEC to produce useful results. Im a programmer so I feel like I might be able to produce the antenna model using a script then feed it into NEC for modeling. On the other hand I am fortunate to have an electronics business and might be able to justify the purchase of a proper antenna modeling package. Is there any package in particular that you would recommend for this level of work?,rfelectronics,d2jgdz3,1,t5_2s9fi

We have a bunch of coalfired power plant at one end of the country where all the coal is and Cape Town is maybe km away though were on Hz so longer wavelength and pretty much nothing in between until relatively recently some solar farms coming online.gtThe voltage drop from the cable resistance along for Km of wire would be large.Not that large compared to the total voltage. Were talking kV and more here to cover these distances.

Honestly most broadcast services are immensely wasteful in bandwidth and in content value.  This is where cutting the cord really is pointing to the future because they are all ondemand and thus more efficient even when transmitted by wireless internet cut back of digital TV channels take back half of the FM band AM isnt much better but not particularly useful for modern modulation techniques and diversity methods so probably leave it be.

11499420,0,t3_644p50,Heres where I think the mental disconnect occurs IQ signals are complex but the transmitted signal is purely real. On receive the complex IQ is able to be reconstructed from a real signal. How the hell does that make sense? How can you go from complex  signals gt real  signal gt complex  signals?The fact that IQ is complex is merely a consequence of the mathematics. Just think of IQ as a pair of real signals a real inphase signal I and a real quadrature signal Q. The Q happens to be shifted by  and mixed with the I signal but thats just by convention so we know how to extract the Q back out on the receivers end.So on transmit we shift the Q signal by  and mix it with the I signal then transmit the product of the two signals. On receive the combined signal is split into two channels where one LAGS the other  phase shift. That lagged version is the decoded Q and the straightthrough path is the I.Now for the QAM piece using a pair of detectors the relative amplitudes of the two real signals can be compared to form coordinates which correspond to x y points on the complex plane where each constellation point corresponds to a specific sequence of binary bits. I hope this explanation makes some sense. Its really weird to think about imaginary numbers representing physical phenomena but there you go.Also please dont confuse H and V polarization with I and Q. They are two distinct concepts. The former deals with with antenna characteristics and the latter with the signal being transmitted.,rfelectronics,dfzgjbm,5,t5_2s9fi
