51295,0,t1_cejwyfn,Western art isnt necessarily the same thing as stylized Western cartoons. Id love to see a cheesy Boris Valejo like take on Holo and Lawrence.,SpiceandWolf,cek9qmz,2,t5_2u15g
58347,0,t1_cel0n4v,OTP  one true pairing as in your top ship. You really need to read the novels.. Holo and Lawrence need each other to be interesting. I thought that side story in  was pretty boring it was just her messing with some kids. The girl being so damn stupid and sheltered was what really ruined it. But again Korbo and Lawrence need each other. Otherwise Korbo is a bag of insecurities on her way to a mental breakdown. A normal guy could not put up with half of her bullshit read the books and you may want to reread ones youve read. And his job is not normal or boring it came with the risk of death.. unlike something normal.. like being a baker or normal craftsman. You know the origin of calling the front seat shotgun was because back in the day the person in that seat had a shotgun to prevent robberies? Lawrence didnt even have a shotgun because they werent invented yet. And that doesnt even touch on the financial risks that came with the job. You need to take the Korbo goggles off youve had em on too long. You arent seeing the series for what it really is if you think Korbo doesnt need Lawrence. ,SpiceandWolf,cel2nk8,0,t5_2u15g

1525409,0,t1_cj73kw2,Yeah pretty much what Hemo said. It skips volume  amp  of the LNs...perhaps because theyre both in anime form so they didnt bother? Im not sure. I think its also skipping all the side colour volumes vol.   amp . Perhaps theyre trying to finish the story in manga form asap  P Great read though.
