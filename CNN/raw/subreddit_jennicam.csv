2710403,0,t1_cnasexm,Thank you.  That was an outstanding find and a great bit of reporting work by those two men on that website.I was late to the party but an avid Jennicam fan.  We chatted online emailed occasionally and then the multiple public relations disasters happened which ultimately caused the sites demise.When someone disappears either in real life or off the internet over time its natural for someone to wonder if they are OK.  I breathed a collective sigh at the end of that report.  Shes settled and happy.  That made me happy as well.,jennicam,cnc5tyt,1,t5_2wx9s
