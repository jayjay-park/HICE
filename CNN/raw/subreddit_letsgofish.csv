Simmons best batting line was in  and each year its gotten worse. Same with Khris Davis and his  numbers. Justin Turners still a backup in Los Angeles despite his peak season.... so clearly the Dodgers dont believe in his production being wholly a product of a truetalent upgrade. Matt Carpenter Mike Trout and Carlos Gonzalez were well thought of prospects so its not like they appeared out of nowhere. Even Gattis story wasnt so much about failure as about physical and mental health. So your examples come down to Jacob DeGrom. Is Dee Gordon Jacob DeGrom? Or is he Justin RuggianoChris CoghlanCasey McGehee?There are a ton of examples of players who have astonishing short term runs and are never heard from again. Chris Johnson lead he NL in batting in .  B.J. Upton and Chone Figgins were AllStar caliber players in . Jose Hernandez was a productive hitter in . There are a ton of these false positives in baseball and most of it is tied to BABIP luck which is what Gordon is feeding on right now.

If he were somehow someway revived after that he would be completely brain dead. There is no point in freezing someone just to bring him back in that condition. Waste of time resources and frankly its rather cruel to the person who is being put through all of that. ,letsgofish,d84lbdo,7,t5_2sclf

Yes I acknowledge that he made a huge mistake but that doesnt make the situation any less sad. How fucking hard is it to have sympathy nowadays? I swear every time something like this happens people are constantly trying to get a magnifying glass and trying to see what dirt can be thrown just for shits and giggles. Same thing happened with Taveras. Go ahead and say Fuck them to their families see how they feel. Its ridiculous in every sense. The mans dead. Its reality. Hes never coming back. Nothing we can do or say will change anything. Theres no could have would have should have because nothings gonna change magically.
