11747780,0,t3_67iv9l,Im interested as well.  Im in a similar boat as you  but in my research its important to know how everything works before you can securebreak into it.My current plan is to focus on my User Support job while working towards mid level server and networking certs.  I have A and Net currently and am finishing up Sec with my eye on MCSA Server  R and CCNA RS.  In my spare time I have a book on Kali Linux and a home lab to practice setting up servers and networking on VMs and VMs to attack with my Kali laptop.  The point being if you dont have a strong foundational understanding of say Networking then youll have a hard time interpreting Wireshark data.  Again Im in a similar boat and just as interested as you in what actual experts will say but this is what Im doing to aim towards Security Research and Pen Testing. My only other advice is to listen to the podcast Security Now.  It has almost  episodes over  years and will give you tons of information on the topic from the real world as well as an explanation of fundamental computing concepts.  I listen to the current episodes each week and have  plowed through back episodes gotten through about  so far and its been awesome.Hope this helps and I look forward to seeing what more knowledgeable people have to add because Im very interested too.,ITCareer,dgrn25w,1,t5_336qe
