916345,0,t3_24kr8m,In your scenario the person who paid to ship the package to be delivered has put it as signature required. This means a UPS can not driver release the package at a residence. Normally without being signature required the driver will just leave the package at the residence. However because the shipper requires a signature andor proof of delivery the driver is not supposed to just leave the package.For this situation if you can not be home for the delivery to get your package you would need to contact your local center and tell them you want to pick it up. You can get in contact with your local center not store a UPS store is not your local center by using PICKUPS. Customer service should be able to get you a number to the center andor customer counter and they can put a notice on your package that it is to be help for pick up. Once that is done you will need to go to the centercustomer counter and pick it up during their business hours which can vary from center to center.UPS delivering system has withstood the test of time. Yes it does suck a small portion of the time. Mostly for packages that can not be driver released or when packages get delivered to an incorrect address. However signature required packages are a small portion of UPSs delivery volume. My advice is to work with whoever is shipping your package and make sure they are not making it signature required. If they are and wont change it to driver release then call the center ahead of time and have them put as hold for pick up at your local center.,UPS,ch8g0h5,3,t5_2qxpi
1349766,0,t3_29jb3d,UPS actually does recycle tracking numbers. Tracking s arent as random as you might think Usually the data doesnt appear from the older package and usually itll be a decent amount of time between the reuse of the tracking number. If you were to contact UPS theyll probably clear it out from what you see online. We deal with large volumes of package data everyday and Ive seen some pretty crazy stuff every day,UPS,cilhgqk,2,t5_2qxpi

5269746,0,t1_cvjalz2,I appreciate your mentality and understand where it is coming from. There are a lot of bad employees with UPS on both sides of the aisle. I just wish this wasnt the mentality or the situation with UPS. I think it could be such a better company if union employees and management would actually find a way to work together instead of being disgruntled with each other. It is not a perfect company and I know few are especially  year old companies.As for upward mobility it really depends on where you are. I have dealt with a few centers in rural areas where the highest turnover position is the center manager. In rural areas it isnt uncommon for full time hourly position to not open up for decades because so few driver positions even exist let alone get vacated very often. However on the whole yes driver positions are more common and readily available.,UPS,cvl9p7s,1,t5_2qxpi
5779412,0,t3_3uaipt,The quick history is that two years ago there were tons of service failures during peak season because retailers made promises without first clearing them with their shippers and UPS and others came out looking bad. Last year UPS corrected the service problems but spent way too much money doing it. So this year the major corporate initiative is cost reduction and you and many others like you will pay for it.Many of the UPSers I know including me are concerned that customers like you will understandably resent this change i.e. this might blow up in our face.In your case you could sign up for My Choice and redirect all your packages to the UPS store. For others it can help to have packages shipped to their places of work. But UPS makes very little money on residential deliveries where drivers cant just release the packages apartments high risk neighborhoods required signatures etc. So for customers in those situations this is the frustrating compromise. You only get one shot because three shots are expensive.,UPS,cxdho49,2,t5_2qxpi
5857617,0,t1_cxnfofd,also the person at the counter when I went to pick up my package was talking to his coworker about the firm crew and executives that were in the warehouse filming a commercial so that may have had something to do with the delay as well.,UPS,cxngna0,1,t5_2qxpi

6307131,0,t3_41prh8,Assuming the package was probably shipped next day air you probably wont see the driver again at that time because company policy does not require heshe to deliver it by a commit time after an attempt has been made. That being said drivers have a lot of pressure to make their commit times every single day and being that you werent available to sign the first time they came by they probably wont risk more time to attempt the stop at that same time again.,UPS,cz6jssg,1,t5_2qxpi
7372759,0,t3_4gbw6c,only thing you could do is ask the shipperthe company who you bought it from a refund for the shipping charges if UPS missed the delivery commitment. You should probably contact UPS and place what is called a DCRdelivery change request and have it updated to a new address. I believe thats like a  dollar fee or about that.,UPS,d2g8ct5,1,t5_2qxpi

The external tracking shows to be at the order processed stage as if the package hadnt been given to UPS.I havent seen this before but even if it had been given to a USPS office it usually just shows a delivered to Post Office message not an Order Ready for UPS message. ,UPS,dc590kl,3,t5_2qxpi
