7622517,0,t3_4gxvs5,I havent had much time to play a whole in the last week or so because Ive been super busy with work and kids and whatnot but I plan on squeezing in a few more games before this weekend.  I mainly just wanted to say that I think the Kickstarter looks great and Im excited for the campaign.  Ive had a lot of fun playing the game and Im fairly confident that it will have no trouble getting funded.  It will be neat to see it on store shelves and be able to tell people that I had some small part in its development process.,HnTPlaytesting,d38n1p6,1,t5_3cp6p
