192931,0,t3_1wah1n,We got Cheerio from a most awful backyard breeder. We got VERY lucky. We knew a good number of the things you are supposed to check and ask. But we did none of those things because we were distracted by the overwhelming poop smell. It assaulted your nose while you were outside. This was in February  all the windows were closed. We had driven  hours so we went in anyway.The puppies were kept in pens in the dark basement. When the breeder brought him upstairs so we could interact with him he started to poop on the floor. We quickly asked where we should take him to do his business and the response was that it was okay for him to poop on the rug. We didnt feel like we were saving him we just absolutely forgot about all of the things to check out because of the conditions. We discovered  as we were driving away that he had never once been outside. He was terrified and stayed terrified of the outside for several months. It took us a couple of months to potty train him. Now he is the most awesome dog weve ever had. His only real issue is that he is afraid of the sound of the dishwasher and people with open umbrellas. And even those things are mild. He has helped my sisters dogaggressive afraid of steps afraid of wood floors dog act like a normal dog. He has helped another friends  year old Sheltie who was never socialized with other dogs learn how to play. ,WiggleButts,cf0eybc,4,t5_2zs5t

2448600,0,t3_2njpcr,She just has a case of puppy ear crazies. They can change a lot during the teething months. They dont really look like they are going prick just rose which is acceptable under the breed standard. If its a concern to you you could have your breeder show you how to tape it. Its a harmless painless way to get her ears to stay in the position preferred. Or if you arent showing her you can just let them do their thing. My older boy has mostly prick ears that I just decided to let be because he has other faults that make him not show quality. His ears started going a little goofy around  months and then around  months made it pretty obvious that they were thinking of going up. They still went up and down a couple more times before just staying up at about  months. But even my younger boy who has mostly button ears will go rose sometimes and they went wonky when he was  months. ,WiggleButts,cmecnan,3,t5_2zs5t

I feel like its a misuse of the word.  So people say Oh yeah Aussies are supposed to be aggressive. theyre not finding the right word or think a barking dog is an aggressive one.I had some random guys approach me in my yard without my invitation while I was outside with Koda.

5083920,0,t3_3kidgq,I just have to comment on the typically shy.  Aussies are not typically shy. Shyness is actually considered a fault. Is he crate trained? That may help with getting him comfortable in the new house. Its pretty normal that dogs with minor separation anxiety wont eat when left alone. As for the dog park Id avoid it for now. Its likely too much too soon especially if hes prone to being a nervousfearful dog. Find other ways to exercise him such as one on one play dates with dogs he gets along with neighborhood or on leash park walks swimming. Expose him to other dogs in a more controlled setting such as a training class. I would never ever ever trust a dog walker who takes a group of dogs to an off leash park. How can one person watch and control a group of dogs all at once that really dont know her well?! Recipe for disaster. Dont do it. A dog walker that actually walks the dogs is perfectly acceptable. But you may need to wait on that too. Peeing in the car is a sign of some pretty severe stress. I would suggest that you contact a behaviorist to get some in person help. Hes at an age that if hes not helped now it can turn into a lifetime of challenges. Is he from a breeder? If so you should chat with the breeder how temperament issues in her lines and what shes done to work with them. ,WiggleButts,cuyt0lz,1,t5_2zs5t

Get her into fetching and run her good everyday that will help.  Also those dogs are so smart it is hard to get anything past them.  Clicker training may work if you stick with it.

And my younger one . yrs black tri who fetches all day but still cant figure out how to roll over. I was throwing the Frisbee for my younger one and it got stuck in a bush so it was just out of her reach on her hind legs. After much distress and terrible balance she ran to get my older aussie who comes over to the bush grabs a branch near the bottom and starts pulling. She was shaking the bush to get the Frisbee to fall out! I never said a word but just watched the whole thing. It still amazes me how smart they are!

6654918,0,t3_46sxq8,I mean ideally for any dog it would be great to have someone around most of the day but realistically  of dog owners work full time. My Aussie is the most high energy of dogs that Ive had but I have no problem working full time and I live by myself.  We play for about  minutes in the morning as Im getting ready for work. After I get home I take him on a min walk and we usually round out the night doing trickscommands. On the weekends I try to take him to the park or we go on hikes for a few hours. I think the bigger issue you will have is that puppies just take a lot more work and training. But if the first several months your boyfriend can work from home you guys should be fine. ,WiggleButts,d07ocsz,3,t5_2zs5t

6787113,0,t3_48kih6,I have a three year old Aussie see Contest  who loves playing frisbee.  Here are a couple things I have learned.  This is my first dog.  Steep learning curve.  Dont over feed them.  Mine gets  cup of dry in the morning and one at night.   I put a hotel desk bell at the front door.  For the first two days i tapped the bell with my foot everytime I took him out to peepoop.  By the third day he was doing it.  If you dont hear him on the first tap he will let you know by batting the bell across the floor.  Crate training.  I started by coaxing him in with treats saying kennel each time.  I also put one of my shirts in there to comfort him.  I also put him in the crate at night and covered it with a blanket.  Again all I had to do was say kennel and he went in with out delay.  They need something to do.  it will be tough in the crate but I gave him a stuffed animal when he was little.  Not a good idea i know but he seemed to like it.  I also got him an antler to chew on.   here is our schedule today at age threewake up pee and eat at  amkids get up eat and I make lunches. we walk and poop off leash.  He picks up a stick EVERY morning something to do and carries it back to the house.  He drops it outside the door.  If it is raining I shake my hand back and forth and tell him to shake and he will sometimes shake off the rain.  Then we go in and I dry him off.  He is then in until noon no crate any longer.  He usually will lay on the chair or his bed.  Then I will walk him around noon or later.  If it is not raining we go throw the frisbee for about  minutes until he is tired out.  Dinner is same thing out to pee then dinner and about an hour after he eats I take him out and he poops usually two in the morning and  or  at night.  Try not to give them people food hard to do when you have kids.  He eats dog treats  mini ones per day.  Zukes peanut butter treats when we are training.  And we started him on raw carrots when he was little.  He loves them still.  That is he favorite treat.  It also makes it easy to identify his poop!I also have to echo the thoughts of Woofmore!  Leash training is huge!  I did not know that until later.  Harnesses nightingales prong I tried them all.  The harness was great as long as he was in it.  The minute we went back to the collar he started pulling.  Voice tone will go along way in training them to walk with you.  High pitched good boygirl! when then do good and a firm tug and heel when they dont.I use Hup for sit and stay.  One word for two commands.  I learned this from my brother who has a bunch of Springers that he trained for birds.  It works.  Finally everybody had an opinion including me!.  Take what you want and leave the rest.  As for training I went through Petco for puppy training.  Then went through another trainer for advanced. Again take what you can use and get rid of the rest.Good luck and post pictures when you get your new wigglebutt.,WiggleButts,d0lluy3,1,t5_2zs5t

Im sorry that people dont like the name but thats the way the tides are turning.

10266363,0,t3_5mzclm,The vast majority of reputable breeders in the US will dock tails soon after birth since it is required by the standards which they breed to. Most reputable breeders will not use color and gender as the primary ways of placing pups and will many will also not let you select them yourself since temperament drive etc. are more important to match. It is more accurate to judge pet vs. show. vs. sport prospects around  weeks. Some exceptions would be breeders with an emphasis on sport breed dogs that are not competing in conformation but these are often higheroctane dogs or pups that are born with obvious mismarks which would disqualify them from being show dogs. Most breeders leaving tails on in the States are backyard breeders. Also worth noting that some pups are born with natural bob tails or partial tails. If you are set on an Aussie with a full tail rescuing is the best option! In addition English shepherds are a similar breed which does not dock.edit forgot weeks!,WiggleButts,dc7qy5h,6,t5_2zs5t
