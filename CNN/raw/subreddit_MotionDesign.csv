1925581,0,t3_2gnhyq,Motion graphics is a huge discipline encompassing an enormous array of technical skills. Some of that could be design editing animation compositing technical direction...Anyone can watch  after effects tutorials  and say they know after effects. If you really want to stand out start with the basics know what good animation and editing look like both of them are about timing and thats crucial and then learn how to do it.Two fantastic books I always end up recommending are The Animators Survival Kit and The Art and Science of Digital Compositing. These get pretty technical and neither of them are about motion graphics per se no mention of shape layers but they are both thorough and entertaining.It might also be a good idea to familiarise yourself with some video basics too since designing for print or the web is very different to design for animation particularly regarding resolution bit depth and frame rate.Hope that helps!,MotionDesign,ckl7vqm,2,t5_2rsyx

2408114,0,t1_cm8zqh5,This. There will always be people who can use a program. But programs change techniques change trends change. The principles of design and the principles of animation are constant. A good eye for design will always get you work. My recommendation to people wanting to get into the industry is to study design not after effects. Then learn the principles of animation and create work using your software of choice to achieve said principles. ,MotionDesign,cm9coai,2,t5_2rsyx

3120821,0,t1_coks9fm,We use dropbox solely where we work. We have all worked with NAS systems before but they were always buggy and slow. So we decided not to go with that approach.We use Dropbox instead now and it works great we dont have to worry about backups and it syncs over LAN so most files are synced pretty fast.We do have a pro account so we have TB of storage per account. You can even selectively sync certain folders so you dont have to always have all your projects on your computer.We havent run out of storage just yet but I think well eventually backup our old projects to external HDDs.,MotionDesign,colh0bn,1,t5_2rsyx

5311202,0,t1_cvqfyd7,Actually the high end Nvidia cards really dont come into their own until you start scaling with multiple boards.  You can find multiple benchmarks where in singleboard configurations high end Ti GeForce cards meet or beat Titans.  The Ti is essentially the same Cuda performance as a Titan Black and the Ti is essentially the same Cuda performance as a Titan X and Quadro M.  You have to splurge on a Titan Z to get better than Geforce Cuda performance in a single card situation.A Ti will outperform a GTX or GTX as well.  You need to jump to a Ti to get the next board that will outperform a Ti unless you really need the updated HDMI spec for certain K applications.,MotionDesign,cvqkgdx,1,t5_2rsyx
5359853,0,t3_3oexkd,You might find more resources by studying design fundamentals there are tons of books on graphic design typography colour theory even studying classical animation techniquesvideos. This summer I really enjoyed reading a beginners guide to constructing the universe by Michael Schneider. Bunch of sacred geometry exercises and relationshipsmeanings between numbers life amp design. Seriously its nuts did you know ancients would grid out a canvas with the proportions of a musical scale and then draw gods in their respective note or key that explanation dosent do it justice music of spheres google thatThinking with type by Ellen Lupton was the type bible at school.Wooden books has some neat books that I find myself flipping through for inspiration.

7490999,0,t1_d2szrzg,If youre a junior you should totally be emailing all producers a link to youre reel letting them know you are available for freelancecontract work. If a studio is busy with a large project they usually make use of juniors too offload the mundane work off of senior people so they can focus on creative work.Its not really a case of it being easy or not more so of getting your name in front of a producer at the right time. I dropped off my demo reel on a Monday and had an interview with a studio on a Wednesday. That lead to freelancecontract work which then lead to fulltime and that was around  years ago so I was just lucky with my timing.Also can I give out a protip but dont drop off USB keys or DVDs of demo reels and please dont bother with printed CVs. Thats all crap thats going to sit on a desk and get ignored. Not because people dont want to look at it but producers and creative directors tend to be busy and dealing with other issues so its just too easy for anything physical to get cast aside.,MotionDesign,d2topei,2,t5_2rsyx

9103825,0,t1_d864ams,Hey thanks for the input! Most of the stuff after the application enters the piece has already been animated and exists in other videos of ours. Not much I can do there unfortunately. I would love to add motion blur but we dont have the luxury of time for that trying to get the company to get us RSMB. I also had the intro slowed down waaaaay more and it made the transitions so much more fun. The boss wanted them sped up so much that it took most of the energy out of them.
