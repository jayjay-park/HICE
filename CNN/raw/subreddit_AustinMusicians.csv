6505227,0,t1_czrzp0f,They didnt do it the next year at all. So the year after THAT ? I didnt even look to see if they were doing it. I figured I could tell myself to record an album in one month without any contestlike scenario urging me to do it. Plus the website RPM Challenge did absolutely nothing to promote the music so there was no benefit in going through them.,AustinMusicians,czs6tnj,0,t5_2u20n
