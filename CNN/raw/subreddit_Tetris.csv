1828606,0,t3_2figne,Just tested it a bit and it is really hard... ok I tried to get what rotational system you use and I managed to pull of a good zspin double took me ages to get a z though even on level  and stopped trying for a tspin as I NEVER got a Mino T...you might try to lower the spawn rates of pentaminos and hexaminos drastically on lower levels as those are barely hard to place or select some categories for them concerning their difficulty e.g. limit the cross a bit more as its really annoying at least for me,Tetris,ck9jf9d,2,t5_2r133

2453114,0,t3_2nlyq2,With only being able to see  piece ahead its a massive gamble. I can get one every  games. A lot of the time I get within one or two pieces of it. Without seeing ahead its a gamble. If you can frequently get within one piece of it youre in very good shape for it.,Tetris,cmewp3g,1,t5_2r133

9565234,0,t3_5bi8hq,Excellent job! I see you used a nonstandard setups in a few places. In particular   I think this is the longest recording of human play that we have for Infinite TST so Im glad that they made it in. Is this the beginning of your hour Times Up! record?At ms you blocked the TST well but completed a piece transfer into a TST continuation. The problem looks like it arose from your stack being too high yet not having a place to put the J after placing your I piece. Tetrises in the TST well are an efficient way to deal resolve stack height even if that is  I piece that is not used efficiently in the TST loop. IMO in Infinite TST T piece efficiency always trumps I piece efficiency.Here is a fumen for one possible Tetris donation though maybe a JOL Tetris donation would be cleaner.This applies for other places as well like   I piece was used for upstacking and  I pieces were used for downstacking before the ITST loop continued. There is room for  Tetris or maybe even .Also congrats on the  Ultra spot!,Tetris,d9s40a7,1,t5_2r133
9672986,0,t3_5dkve5,My main problem with your play is your decision making. Your stacking could use work. To remedy this you can try to go sub  without using hold. Hold interrupts the flow of your stacking and makes your stacking less natural. Think about how pieces are generated the game serves you bags of the  different pieces in a random order repeatedly. This is why you cant get more than two of a piece in a row. When you hold you arent stacking with all of the  different pieces anymore  youre effectively skipping one of the unique pieces. To me this puts you in danger of stacking unnaturally as we intuitively learn to stack with the  unique pieces sort of. Holding also just adds a layer of complexity to your decision making that makes your decisions slower  holding should be a last resort. Think about it  MicroBlizz only held one piece in his WR run.You should also go onto harddrop.com and read some stacking guides. Theyre hella useful and they changed the way I think about stacking.I think you should stare at this replay and pick it apart. What could you have done better? Theres lots of vertical variation in your stack you should figure out how to avoid it. In sprint you want to shoot for a relatively flat stack. not completely flat though you need divets for S  Z at least Another good thing to do might be to play very slowly with  gravity so you can take a long long time to make stacking decisions.. if you do that enough those good decisions may become intuition so you can do them faster.,Tetris,da5ecqd,5,t5_2r133
