2229116,0,t3_2kob6l,Ive played Blood Dragon and seen the walkthrough of it. It should be noted that it has UPlay DRM so you cant play it offline. Good engine good graphics very open world with moderately realistic vehicle movement. Id get it on sale but I hear its very highly rated.There are references to the earlier Far Cry series but it is not connected directly. ,NextGame,cln69i2,1,t5_349d0
