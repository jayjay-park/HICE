22368,0,t1_cegv5vr,Before I answer your question I just want to make my view on this topic public I truly believe in the healing power of marijuana.  I know the typical party line is complete abstinence but I think thats bullshit.  At least for me.  And heres why.My addiction is called le pig.  The best sort of reenactment of le pig would be the crazy fucked up skunk that represents Frankie Wildes addiction in Its all gone Pete Tong.  If you havent seen it I HIGHLY recommend it.  Its the beast.  The pain.  The voice that tells you just one more man cmon we can do it.  Itll be fine.  Thats how I have chosen to look at it.  Now le pig hes always fucking hungry.  Hes like water in a glass constantly looking for a way to drip out of the smallest tiny imperfection.  And soon that imperfection leads to a crack etc etc and soon the glass is empty.  He is an insidious adversary.  I use pot to subdue le pig.  When I feed him weed he quiets down and lets me get on with my day.  We are still friends and were cool.  Hed rather use heroin but hes a fucking pig hes just happy with whatever.  Long story short pot allows me to not focus on doing dope all day.  I know it sounds kinda weird but for me thats how it is and it works.So to answer youre question Yes I smoke pot.  Quiet a bit actually.  I try and stay away from harder drugs particularly uppers Meth Coke because back in the day I used opiates to come down from those drugs.  I just dont need to tempt my insidious friend.  But I have done hard drugs in the  years Ive been off of heroin and had no problems.  Once you make up youre mind definitively its not hard to not do it.  This bullshit about how relapse is part of recovery is a fucking sham.  Relapse has nothing to do with recovery in fact it has to do with the opposite of recovery.  This paradigm in the recovery community promoting the culture of alleviating personal responsibility is a joke.  Its all about these so called professionals covering their asses and making more money.  Its not my fault Johnny paid  for treatment and relapsed its a part of recovery.  But we have another bed for him.  Another  please.  What a fucking lie.  ,OpiatesRecovery,cegzagn,1,t5_2tkk8

88689,0,t3_1v40fs,I used for the last time yesterday. I have to admit it and move on. I laid awake for a long time last night just thinking about what a mess my life has become. I was sober for nearly three years until my brother died and it was good and bad. I dont know if Im ever gonna be that person again but I can try. I can try at least. I have to try because if I am honest with myself I know that I am on the verge of losing my relationship my job and Ive whittled my finances down to barely anything. I shut my business down last year when I was in the throes of addiction. I hate to face the reality of the situation but I realize at this point if I continue down that path I will surely die. I pulled myself out of a meth addiction at  and so many dark dive bars and xanax pills at  how can I be weaker now? But I had to change my whole life again and again to succeed with those feats change my city my state my frame of reference. Something has got to give. Something has got to change.

396247,0,t1_cflthow,Options are getting pretty limited.  My family refuses to ... not necessarily acknowledge me but theres not much in the way of any help.  I have a very very small family anyway.  Just my mother and sister.  The last time I talked to my sister she told me I was dead to her and that she didnt want any further contact.    My moms been more supportive but the distance shes keeping from me is about the same as my sister.  Shell talk to me at least.   I am staying with my bff.  It is still very tentative as hes a straight normie and doesnt even know what intoxication feels like.  I can see in his face the concern and fear as I am basically falling apart detoxing and withdrawling.  The place he lives is very remote so thats a great plus.  Remote enough that for me to score yesterday it took me  hours driving just to do so.    Ive done too many  month stays in inpatient rehabs and this cycle just keeps on repeating.  I keep going back out.  Like I am not ready.  The doubt is always there.   That I can be sober.    Of course the drugs are the bandaid that I put over some ... inexplicable wound in me.  I have gone sober participating in AANA working the steps but that wound is always still there festering and rotting inside me.  Ive gone  months of soberity and working the steps about  times.  I remember doing a thth step about six months ago with one of my many abandoned sponsers.  And he just telling me that he was so sorry for me because I had no idea where this fiend in me is.  Where it starts or ends.  Its just there and I feel completely broken.  So I just feel exhausted and hopeless.  So many times have I tried to do this even in the past with WAY more conviction than I feel now and I have continued to fail.  So I just have doubts that giving me more chances is worthwhile.  I want to end my life.  I am in Washington.  I lost my recent job due to heroin use and basically just falling apart.  I am on the free Obama care.  I read over some of the terms and benefits of my Washington Apple Health  benefit plan.  But I am still uncertain whether something like rehabilitation programs are an option for me or are covered.  Let alone something like starting a maintenance plan like suboxone or methadone.    One option that I know I definitely have and I have done before is Washingtons Access To Recovery  ADATSA program  In order to be eligable for this program I need to be unemployed for one month be in active use and not be able to get a job because of my use.  I just lost my job  days ago.    ,OpiatesRecovery,cflu57l,1,t5_2tkk8

Medical professionals can be jerks sometimes especially when you fess up to being an addict. They are really used to being harangued for pills day in and day out and its hard for them to switch gears. For someone who has been keeping such a huge secret for so many years I really dont blame you for not wanting to out yourself just yet. Im just so happy that youre making the decision to try and move forward Im not sure where youre located but where Im at in Ontario you dont have to get your doctor involved with your recovery at all. You can see a counselor and be referred to inpatient or outpatient treatment and go through medically supervised withdrawal or maintenance therapy without referral by your GP. Im glad that youre thinking about checking out a meeting tomorrow! Thats great! It may seem a little weird at first if youve never been to one before but keep an open mind.

620975,0,t3_217qj6,Hey!  Hah I feel EXACTLY like this at the moment.    I know you have seen the few posts I have put up but since I am drinking coffee and just starting my day up I figure Id share some thoughts and perhaps if you want we could talk about it a bit.    I woke up yesterday after sleeping for two hours at  AM.  The previous week had been like that in general.  But the difference with yesterday was I had a very hyperrealistic using dream.  It really funked up my entire sense of wellbeing and the resolve to do this completely.    The day went well and tonight I finally got some sleep waking up feeling a lot less clouded but by getting ...... more and more aware?  I mean its hard to explain... It feels like my perception is just becoming bigger and bigger in everyway and because of that the great sense of reality kicks in.  How big and ominous this universe is and how terrifyingly empty it can feel.  I can feel that natural survival instinct kick on like wow.... Am I safe?  I cant escape this feeling because its literally who I am?  Is your experience in anyway similar?    This gets me thinking either way.  I am beginning to understand why NAAA focuses so much on the higher power concept.  I dont know what your religous beliefs or spiritual beliefs are and really does it matter?  But the reason they start talking about that stuff is to quell that emptiness I think.    This brings me back to an experience I had back when I was about  or  when I got sober for about a year.  I had sat down with this renowned drug councelour and they were picking my brain.  And she just asked me as I remember dealing with this exact same concept when is it going to be ok?  And that got me thinking about the emotions and feelings driving me.  When is it going to be ok?  Like is it a destination in the future?  Is there something in this here and now moment that makes me ok?  What does it take to make me feel ok?    And I suppose what I got from that experience and some other ones too is that you have to ask what Albert Einstien thought was the most important question anyone could ask themselves    Is the universe a friendly place?    Im an atheist or really moreso an apatheist but I KNOW that theres a true self in me a deep resonating voice that despite all my fears sadness anger and grief from losing my true love bitch heroin everything is going to be ok....   Weird.  Anyway feel free to PM me or hit me up.  You are not alone.,OpiatesRecovery,cgaut5t,2,t5_2tkk8

Also the NA step working guide has a good explanation of how to interpret the steps if you dont want god or anything like that. Its somewhere in step  or  I believe. Basically it suggests making the group of addicts your higher power. Thats what I do its tangible and it obviously works for me. I go there I share I listen and those people help me stay clean. I can see how someone who is new might have a hard time with this but every meeting Ive ever been to has been accepting of people with different beliefs. The only thing we ask is that you accept other people believe in god and that those beliefs work for them. ,OpiatesRecovery,cgxk25v,3,t5_2tkk8

849017,0,t3_23ps50,suboxone has been very important for me and though im aware i may have to pay the piper eventually andor go through the PAWS later its been very helpful.suboxone put a floor under me from dayone this allowed me to start immediately ballstothewall putting into place the life and habits i need to live completely clean when i do get off the stuff. i mean ive been around someone actively sniffing Opana god i loved that shit and havent really even had too many urges to use  really intense ones i could count on one hand. my program is pretty intense early to rise healthy breakfast vigorous walk andor yoga meeting almost every day continuing care alanon na heart of recovery SMARTRecoveryi do them all ton of vegetables nuts and canned salmon for lunch yoga xweek. i do have a problem with consumption of sugar but ill worry about it later or if it gets any further entrenched. i am being true to my emotions and needs. it all feels pretty darn good.i have a sponsor who supports me and doesnt look down his nose because of the sub. being around folks who wont judge you for it i think is really important. i also have to keep myself moving forward with the taper even if its slower than id like due to being around opiates every day. i might drop another mgday in a couple weeks now that im separated again i started in midjune  on mgday and now take mgday in the AM and  in the PM to help keep fatigue at bay.i also have kaiser hmo in wash dc and they paid for about  of my iop which was over k they cover everything for my continuing care treatment too except for a  copay. they take addiction very seriously because they dont want to pay for the horrible health issues that come with it. its not altruism after all . . . . funny though is that a sub prescription from my treatment program is month which i bet it isnt from an inhouse doc . . .let me know if i can tell you anything else!EDIT much love and respect!,OpiatesRecovery,ch0sctt,1,t5_2tkk8

I wasnt directly told to not cry but I felt thats what i had to do because i had never seen my father grieve himself.  Still havent to this day and im now  years old.  Not sure if it is to show strength in the time of despair or what but it is what it is.

If you ask them for help the wall will come down quickly and youll be free. The next wall may be a little smaller and eventually youll be like a Level  sledge hammer and can topple walls with one swing. Every now and then you will still meet a boss wall.

A few hours later I had something called SVT where by heart beat BPM for pretty much no reason. I found out I had a heart problem and eventually got it fixed but caffeine specifically did that to me. Caffeine also is literally poison. Its a natural insecticide that some plants create to supposedly kill insects that wish to feed off of it. So the phrase choose your poison is very applicable. I almost had to have cardioversion though because of caffeine!...fun times...shudder. Many people in step programs do overdo caffeine especially.

992868,0,t1_chgzyp4,Its so rough because every time I th step it ended so badly.  But I have seen couples meet up in recovery and have awesome relationships.    Acceptance is a huge part of my recovery so I constantly just have to remind myself that selfobsession and obsessive compulsion is a symptom of the disease neural pathways.  So I have to be constantly vigilant and mindful of these primal urges and try and figure out what the motivation is.  I think a HUGE issue for me personally that in early recovery the motivation for my behaviour is soo eratic and I cannot place the meaningfulness or the desire of my outcome to the relationships I foster.  Is this woman just a fix for how I feel?  Or do I truly find something in the strange chemistry and her eyes that makes me want to love her despite her flaws and sick behaviour.  Whats frustrating in my experience is even DESPITE my unconditional love there was still a HUUUUUuuuuuge gap between that love and how this feels.  I couldnt reconcile the differences and the deep void within myself that heroin had ripped into me.  Her love sex and intimacy was never enough.  And their demons became mine.  And in our relationship on the primal levels of love.    It became unbearable and the answer I had was Fuck it.  Which... was ... not fun.  Not worth it.    But I always root for love still.  ,OpiatesRecovery,chh5a26,1,t5_2tkk8

Just be there for him and support him and be his fucking rock let him know you have his full support if he is willing to take the clean road. Also make it very very very clear to him its you or the dope. Period. If he does happen to relapse dont hate him for it and dont think its because he doesnt love you or care about you.

1035952,0,t1_chl3ngc,This is kinda why I feel awkward and out of place here and in other recovery type settings.  I dont go to meetings and I take  mg of suboxone every week.  I have  days clean stopped counting.  I also drink once or twice a week. I used opiates for five years that was my problem.  Im not your typical exjunkie.  I feel like I cant go to meetings because Im not clean alienated from the recovery community. But honestly without suboxone I wouldve have this long of clean time. I never wouldve imagined Id make it this far.  For me not using dope Im more at risk of falling back into my eating disorder tendenciesself harm than say alcoholism. Im taking things one step at a time and dealing with my demons in my own way I dont fit the model.  Ive never been happier. It would be nice to have a supportive community but Ive been doing this on my own my whole life I guess I will continue to do so.

I was normal before I used this substance and I will be normal again after my brain gets adjusted. I wont conform to believing that due to some Godfearing program that tries to convince people they are permanently fucked for life. And your view is becoming contradictory as fuck lol. You dont believe in PAWS but only the symptoms yet admit its caused by the same thing everybody already knew it was caused by?

But as other people suggested the best way to get over it is to stay clean. Itll take time but youll get there.

I am the latter unfortunately. Whether through caffeine oxy booze whatever Ive always tried to control my reality. It is a control issue. No doubt. Im focusing on nootropics and exercise right now. You will see similar hardcore lifestyle hacking from many people in recovery. We are control freaks that second type of addict. Picking something relatively healthy to control and a relatively healthy method is the key. Dont think about booze or other exceptions. Think Im a fucking control freak deep down. What can I control that wont kill me? Health? Cognition? Money beware gambling? Hobbies? Just keep in mind that all things other than chemicals are hard to control. Things happen. Healthy folks get sick or injured. Dieters fall off. Nootropics nerds plateau. Hobbies fall apart or get lame and boring. Have backup plans. Dont think about which drugs are ok for controlling your reality. Think about what activities soothe the need for control. Pick a few. Keep the perspective. ,OpiatesRecovery,cioemjx,4,t5_2tkk8

I remember the feeling you describe being completely sober and not having the desire to use eat at away at me every day.  I thought my addict days were in the past and thinking about them was like thinking of a previous life or something.  Then one day I got access to some pills and my junkie instinct took hold like it had never left.  Maybe youre different hopefully youre different but many addicts Ive met are addicts for life  we suffer from a disease whether were using or not.Im not trying to be a bummer or say that you will inevitably relapse.  Im just trying to make sure you dont let your guard down and get comfortable.Congrats again on your sobriety and good luck in the future!,OpiatesRecovery,ckpa17l,2,t5_2tkk8

2001317,0,t3_2hm8j0,Oh gosh just look through my post history  I am the exgf of an addict. I would do all over again in a heart beat. He is the love of my life but hes so so sick. He cant give me what I need right now. He needs to focus on getting sober. Maybe later on we can try again. The hope is what keeps me going. I miss him every day and feel incomplete without him in my life.My advice would be this If they are not making an HONEST effort to get and stay clean stay away for your own selfpreservation. Its an emotional roller coaster and there is so much stress added in to your life....but like I said  I would do it again. Because the times he was sober were the best days of my life. ,OpiatesRecovery,ckucwd5,2,t5_2tkk8

Use this opportunity to start knew and seriously consider the fact that your drug use may be caused by a need to self medicate. Wellbutrin is a nonnarcotic and has been immensely helpful to me and a handful of addicts both drugs and alcohol that I know. Best of luck homie.

2102969,0,t1_cl70530,Definitely dont plan on him relapsing. Hopefully he wants to get better. Youll know because he will genuinely say it. Also when he gets back if hes serious he will be going to meetings or trying to network with new sober friends. You have to let that happen but also it can be used as an excuse. Also if you see hes clean and actively talking about recovery and involved in recovery you know hes working on it. If he starts to get distant or sketchy youll know hes relapsed or on his way. EVERY addict is different a lot relapse and some dont. Id really really suggest finding al anon meetings in your area to help you find others who also have loved ones who useused and understand what theyre going through. Most importantly show him love and support but dont enable him and protect yourself. I really wish you the best of luck. But please also research codependency and make sure youre putting your sanity first.baddiction is very powerful and it is a disease it makes us addicts do things against our will and our morals but when we are in active addiction we dont care.,OpiatesRecovery,cl74sus,2,t5_2tkk8

If my parents had sent me to rehab for an incident I got into with Klonopin back in highschool not that its their fault they didnt theres a chance I wouldnt have become a dope head and Im really struggling with staying clean right now. Nowadays the way it goes is kids start with pain pills then move onto heroin when theyre out of options. Im not saying this is a definite outcome but its a huge possibility down the line. The sooner you understand and make an attempt to stop addictive behavior the better. Also take whatever he says with a grain of salt.

He died a few months later. nothing he could have done. wasnt caused from anything drug related.after overcoming what was supposed to be the hardest thing in his life heroin addiction he goes and gets fucking cancer and dies. nov th marked  years. fuck i love him and miss him so much.anyways i dont know how relevant this experience is but it is the first time i every every typed in out and it felt wonderful. even though i was crying the whole time lol,OpiatesRecovery,cm04axd,3,t5_2tkk8

I cant say for sure that the cravings wont come back because its only been about  days since I last used but for the first time in all of my time in recovery I havent wanted to use. Im not even on any type of pink cloud either. Im sure the cravings will come back but for now Im happy to be sober.My last go at recovery lasted  months and it was awful. I even resorted to alcohol after  months relapse if you see it that way to deal with the cravings. But then I get into trouble when I drink so I stopped and relapsed. My first go at getting off heroin I had to rely on other drugs to deal with the absence of opiates and because of that it was easy and I made it  months but thats not truly being clean.Id say it gets better after a while.

I just needed to take a step back and accept that you all are right I havent given them a single reason to trust me in years. In addition my defensive and in retrospect childish behavior or screaming and yelling did not help the situation at all. I did take a drug test and show them that I was clean... but I need to realize that just because I am feeling better and feel as though I am in a better place I cant expect them to be able to see that immediately. JUST TO CLARIFYI started the journey with my seat belt on but took it off to remove my coat. Stupid move I know but its just further proof that my higher power has better things in store for me than being strung out or dead on the side of a road somewhere.

Your story gave me that feeling in your throat where you almost start to cry  Im sure this is heartbreaking and all you want to do is understand what he was thinking and why he did what he did. Any addict will tell you even after months or years of clean time you still think about using everyday. Its a demon that will always be there whispering in your ear that just once wont hurt. Its fucking bullshit. August  I lost my dad. He was an opiate addict for  years not kidding. My childhood consisted of watching him go in and out of rehab stay clean then relapse.. finally when I was  he got clean for  years. He started on suboxone as well then I started using and cut off contact with him. I didnt talk to him for  months before he killed his girlfriend and then committed suicide. When we had to clean out his apartment I found  full scripts of subs but I also found a few used needles hidden. I guess what Im trying to say is addiction will have a hold on you no matter who you have as a support system or how long youve been clean. I hope you and your family make it through this together. If you ever need to talk please feel free to PM me. Much love,OpiatesRecovery,cnuwu79,1,t5_2tkk8

You may see others doing the same thing she did towards you Depends on how many people you wronged and some will accept you and you will feel better.

When I lasted used it was becoming so bad that I had temporarily lost my hearing in one of my ears due to my sinuses being so fucked up.  It was a rough few weeks to say the least when I first stopped but honestly for maybe a month or so after that it rarely crossed my mind...although there was a lot going on at work and with the holidays and such I was able to remain fairly busy and keep it out of my mind. It may be worth noting that I suffer from major depression and have seen tried therapy in the past although its been a few years since Ive done that. Its just to me I am never happier than when I can shut myself away from everyone and escape from it all with opiates.

I go to NA occasionally but at a lot of the NA meetings where I am having six months could mean youre an old timer which is kind of silly to me but whatever. Also a lot of NA meetings where i am are VERY Godcentered which Im not super fond of either. Not all of them are like that though. If AA works for your SO more power to him.

I stayed on it for two weeks hoping the side effects would subside but they didnt so I chose not to get the vivitrol injection. Initially I was so scared of relapsing because I always had in the past. I didnt relapse. I made working on my recovery my number one priority I do the AA thing attend meeting work the steps have a sponsor etc. I also meditate and work out. A year later and Im still sober. As long as you are being honest with yourself as to why you want to stop vivitrol and keep doing the next right thing you will succeed. Good luck to you. ,OpiatesRecovery,coba76r,2,t5_2tkk8

I can look up the figures if youd like but in many cases its the result of mixing medications benzos most often or consuming alcohol while on the meds. Personally I also think the very fact they are often prescribed by a doctor gives people a false sense of security. Many of the overdoses arent typical drug addicts but pain patients the elderly...swaths of the population who otherwise wouldnt touch drugs. But that part is just my opinion not sure if they data would support it or not. ,OpiatesRecovery,cofoyfl,1,t5_2tkk8

3141506,0,t1_cokx89z,I was going to say. Hitting rock bottom is all about perspective. OP says he dropped out of school. Most junkies never even go to school or university so from your perspective I would say that is pretty bad. From my perspective if I dropped out of school due to opiates I would consider that rock bottom. School is everything to me. Its a direct investment in my future. It will determine if I have a fulfilling career and if I will finances to buy my own house.Also due to my personality and family I would never be the type of Addict that would be running around stealing for another fix while living under a bridge although you never really know . This makes the idea of dropping out of school because of opiates even more devastating. OP if you read this I would like you to think about where you see yourself in the future. This may be your rock bottom and from here it can only go up.Sorry if this is hard to read I just woke up lol ,OpiatesRecovery,conm4bo,1,t5_2tkk8

This is the first time Ive ever done anything like this because starting to do drugs at a young age women were never really important. It was always the drugs that I had my eyes on. Surprisingly I felt confident without a drug in my system. I used to rely on dope and stimulants like coke or alcohol to even socialize with the opposite sex. So this was a small victory for me.Another thing. I got an email from a guy who plans to start a collegiate recovery groupclub at my school. I gladly said Id join and this could be a chance for me to be more active on campus. Unfortunately he said things like this have been done in the past but always fizzled out so hopefully this time will be different.Working tonight close and havent really had any homework all week since its been snowingsleeting so much a lot of my classes were cancelled.

3447302,0,t3_2zpvhi,Speaking from my experiences with my long term GFwife and periods of time where I was the only addict periods where she fell prey to my always having opiates around seeing how I used them as an escape and eventually got herself sober to bring it back full circle where I was again the addict in the relationship. I feel that there is only so much you can do and only so much influence you can have on your partner when it comes to deciding to get or stay clean. You could provide the best in emotional physical and any other sort of support but if he isnt fully committed your helpsupport would be wasted. It seems like you know him pretty well I am not sure how long you have been together but you can already see the early signs of him justifying and then going out to use. I am sure you can see how this type of situation would be detrimental to your recovery. I think you should have a discussion with him and start out with being very clear on how you want nothing aside from getting and staying clean right now. You hope that he is with you on this and can see how much of a negative impact it has already had on your lives and that he is down with getting both of your lives back on track and where you want them to be. This means sticking with your recovery when life is a bitch to you on top of the difficultly and overall crappy feelings early recovery brings. Tell him you feel that if he isnt able to find ways to deal with the stress from his dad asap that you feel like he could use it as a justification to go and use. I think you really need to ask yourself if recovery is your top priority right now? Are you willing to push forward with it and stay clean even if he isnt able to be part of it with you? If it comes to that what will you do? I would make clear to him your intentions and how badly you need to stay on this path try to work on some strategies to minimize the stress from his dad ie. come clean to dad and tell him to lay off for awhile or avoid him all together also realize that sometimes as much as you want to make this a journey you complete together  it just isnt possible that way. Sometimes a couple that is using together has too hard of a time getting clean and recovering together. If your resolve does not match up one can easily drag the other who is doing much better down and the cycle continues. I have been part of one and seen it so many times. I wish you the best of luck and hope you push through this cause you can definitely make it happen if you choose to but do some serious thinking and introspective look  IMO that will be your most valuable advice right now. ,OpiatesRecovery,cpl7vp2,1,t5_2tkk8
3471740,0,t1_cpnv5pk,If you have a history of alcohol it may be especially bad but I dont believe that a little bit of alcohol especially if you can keep it to an occasional one or two glasses of wine or a beer. My wife and I have a bottle of champagne a couple of times a week when we go to the sauna and we love it. It helps me relax take my mind off of other things  it has helped me keep cravings away. Of course thats just the occasional drink. Too much can lead to another addiction. Youre the one who knows best. The advice that I would give is to know yourself learn from yourself through this and know where you will fail if you go down a certain path.Good luck. Check in here.

3499242,0,t1_cpr4ws1,If you are in a relationship where someone is in recovery you both are in recovery. Abstinence is only the first step but it is a huge step to take. I sincerely doubt the ability of any recovering addict to use weed or be in a committed relationship with someone who is using any drug and stay sober. Recovery is a lifestyle a mindset. Half measures do not work. At least I never have seen them work and have been told from many addicts that it doesnt work. You either do it  or fail.Using excuses like she is scared of detox because it might slow her education? Maybe but how do you think her education will go if she is in active addiction? Not well I would guess. Active addiction will tank any chance of a normal life. At least with rehab and detox there is a chance. Unless she is committed to changing her life she will not recover.,OpiatesRecovery,cpr50j2,0,t5_2tkk8

There really is no way to come off of heroin painlessly there will be a large amount of discomfort for a week or two most likely. Be ready to remind yourself that all the feelings are temporary and will pass. The anxiety and pain is due to the abuse weve put our mind through.

Probably gonna be dour for a few months until the brain finally kicks back on making the feel good.  Its there.  I hope you know?    The other thing too I mean with the cessation of use and no more subs the brain wont be making the feel good and if there is a neurological issue it might be helpful to talk with a real honest doctor.  Sometimes it is an actual issue and not just addiction and I think it would be presumptuous and dangerous for anyone to say outright cut the shit and dont use ANYTHING because thats not clean.  Sometimes I think of this stuff a little differently than the hardcore.  Its a far cry from shooting dope and fucking people over.  On the other hand if you truly feel tired of being tied and owned by chemicals I think exercise homeopathy and therapy are a better route.  You are definitely worth it man.

3970493,0,t1_cr8u48t,I think the question that helped me most with this was something like what situation do you think you couldnt get through clean.  I think it is in the reservations section of step one.  This question was one that I couldnt answer immediately.  I really had to think about it.  I finally came up with if my husband died.  I thought the pain would be so great that I would just want to die and that feeling usually leads me to use.  The more I thought about it the more I realized I wouldnt use.  I mean I really thought about it for like months.  I thought about how it would feel...how i would react...i mentally took all the steps through the experience and realized I could get through clean.  For me being a stupid intellectual I really have to play that mental game with myself.  I dont know.I dont know if i could ever answer the question your sponsor asked you.  Even with the clean time I have amassed.  I think you have the right attitude...can i stay clean today?  it is weird the way gratification changes from using to recovering.  using...everything is so instant.  in recovery the gratification comes with patience and after the event.  I have been trying to focus on that ... how much better I will feel after.,OpiatesRecovery,cr8vazo,2,t5_2tkk8

I wish I had the sense to quit at your age. Lost conditional offers to Oxford SOAS and a bunch of other good British schools I nodded out in a number of my final exams for fucks sake. That failure and the depression that ensued has messed with me but you know what I am so much stronger because of it. I have been in rehab  times have been homeless have been psychotic and in prison in a rd world country methamphetamineheroin hotrods  no charges was just crazy and the only institution was prison no psychiatric facilities in the country. I have been clean off anything hard for  years and change and Im about to go to University at a great school. KILL this fucking addiction now it only gets harder to quit and the reprecussions only get worse. Get clean for you and your future even though there is that shit from your friends looming over your head  be glad that they arent indifferent to your struggles  thats infinitely worse. As others have said in this thread NA is never a bad thing to hit up. Get some accountability in your life and quit brothersister!

4055428,0,t3_36zgbs,Whats bringing on these cravings?  Have you considered major changes to your life? Extended inpatient treatment? Switching to Suboxone? Honestly  methadone will just keep you running on the addiction wheel. Unless youre participating actively in your own recovery youre just going to keep placing all your hope in drugs. Methadone maintenance will get to to a better place than you were before but you are still chained to opiates and a powerful one at that.Ive been a year off heroin and all opiates. I had to move to another state and do  months of inpatient to get here. It was a huge pain in the ass but Im finally free of drug dependence. I feel better than I ever have. I spent two years on Suboxone maintenance and I was a neurotic mess. I thought Suboxone was my salvation at the time even though I just craved heroin constantly. I just figured thats what recovery was supposed to be. I was so wrong. These days I dont crave heroin. When I do think about it I feel sad I spent so much of my life with a needle in my arm. When I was on subs I just looked at heroin fondly like an old friend.,OpiatesRecovery,crijs7o,1,t5_2tkk8

4071569,0,t1_crkd0mr,I appreciate you clarification and response.  I feel the need to clarify also and I will be brief.  step programs are not the only thing that works there are countless other programs that work for people.  It is very effective  the many doctos hospitals institutions and millions upon millions of addictsalcoholics that have recovered by utilizing the spiritual principles of the program can attest to this.  If there was a better solution that worked en masse like this program then it would be just as popular or more.  Theres a reason it is as popular as it is.I wasnt saying that strictly because my sponsor said it that it MUST be truth.  I was qualifying him in that not only was he an indigent alcoholic for  years but he was sponsored by the creator of the step program has  years in recovery and has a Masters degree from arguably the most highly accredited treatment facility in the entire world.  This to me means he knows what hes talking about.  Hes lived the life of an addict lived the life in recovery and received formal education in substance abuse.I did not mean to be demeaning my sickness progressing to a near fatal point is not a badge of honor it is a fact and one Im not proud of.  Does the person who has stage  cancer also brag about the extent of their illness?  No it simply is what it is  their disease has progressed to the point that many options are halfmeasures and it then becomes necessary to treat them in a certain way.  Does this ensure success?  No but to ensure the highest possibility of success they need a level of treatment befitting the progression of their disease.  Like other diseases addiction is not our fault but it IS our responsibility.,OpiatesRecovery,crkdwor,1,t5_2tkk8

4296862,0,t1_cs9xao6,Ive found Buddhist philosophymeditation helpful but I dont really buy into the whole thing. It definitely helps me keep things in perspective and believe there is practical wisdom to be gained but I dont think they are a panacea.Regarding altruism selflessness and love I think there is a reason that most religions have them at their core. Connect feeling and helping produces such pleasant feelings. And I dont mean that in some reductionist way but Im also not being spiritual either. In either case there really is no doubt in my mind that we humans as mammals are programmed to be a part of a group. Personally loneliness has been very hard for me as of late and in that regard opiates made things very easy.Ive never heard of neurolinguistic programming although I did a wikipedia search. I mean from a cursory reading it seems like there is some truth to it but like a lot of overarching methodsphilosophies the devil is in the details. Its easy to justify  a lot of things when youve got some things right. Im fairly skeptical of these developments but often there is something that can be learned.My personal philosophy is something like a part of us knows what is right or that some idealized version of ourselves exists in our heads and when we live according to that ideal we can become happy. I dont know if thats true and I dont know how much my own chemistry makes me unhappy surely theres some of that at play. And stepping back I dont know if its moral relativism or what maybe we all are somehow tapping into the same center from different parts of the circle. Not too sure either way right now Ive got more practical matters to worry about. ,OpiatesRecovery,cs9z9f0,1,t5_2tkk8

4465690,0,t3_3c9sq0,This is just my opinion but acid can be extremely beneficial for introspection and catalysing deep personal change. BUT you can also use it for the wrong reasons. Think about why you want to use LSD and be completely honest with yourself. If any component of your desire to use it is for escapism or to have a good time or just to feel better then forget the idea.Consider waiting a month before tripping. If the idea of waiting bothers you then you might be using it for the wrong reasons. The time will also give you a chance to mentally prepare for the trip so you can use it productively. The acid will wait until youre ready for it there is no rush.,OpiatesRecovery,cstksva,8,t5_2tkk8

My exboyfriend and I did oxys until they changed the formula and then we switched to heroin. Putting myself back in that place... I would have immediately terminated communication with anyone even a best friend if they had told my family about my addiction. Opiates felt more important more satisfying more dependable than ANY friendship. I think youre better off listening supporting and making gentle suggestions with the biggerpicture goal of maintaining communication. Personally NA has helped me stay clean. Doesnt work for everyone. But maybe you can look up some information about drug counsellors and meetings in her area. Ive found it really helpful to meet with an addictions counsellor both before and after getting clean. Offer to support her if SHE decides to speak with her family and seek help. Ask her to let you know how you can be helpful. Refer her to this sub.

As far as  steps to each his own the way I see it as a neuroscientistwell technically I wont have my doctorate for about  days but Im gonna go ahead and call myself a neuroscientist I think everyone has to find their own way. For example Im an addict mainly opiates no doubt but I can totally drink alcohol Ive never enjoyed alcohol and almost never drink it at my best friends wedding reception I had a mere one beer hell I dont consume caffeine so I also dont subscribe to the idea that an addict is an addict is an addict i believe certain personalities are attracted to certain substances and some of the fMRI work my professors were working on when I first entered the program seemed to support that though trading addictions is obviously possible. I also believe in the idea of moderation even in someone who has previously had severe addiction issuesI realize this is extremely controversial in addictionology as abstinence is pretty much their motto but the reason I believe an addict can use potentially addictive substances in moderation once in a long while is because I know people this way including one of my professorsadvisers. Im not saying everyone can do that nor am I saying I can do that Im just saying everyone has their own path they need to walk Im just looking to take that first few steps onto my path.

4794446,0,t3_3gk4rv,Interesting question. And congrats on  weeks clean. Im no expert but due to my choice of employment I have a ton of exposure to all different types of addicts and sometimes people who just got in bad situations but arent really addicts. Let me explain. I know addicts who have overdosed many many times. These same people have spent decades on the streets and have rapsheets that are beyond long. I know addicts that have nowhere left to stick a needle. Im talking about shooting in their dicks doesnt even work anymore. Everything is collapsed. But they can recover if they are willing to do the work. Most of them DO recover IF they actually honestly and thoroughly do the work. Addiction isnt necessarily about how low your bottom is or how chemically addicted you are. Addiction is a thought disorder. Being homeless doesnt make one an addict. The way we think is what separates us from the normies. Addiction does change you. I agree with you there. But not necessarily in the way that you mean. The brain damage sure that is a factor. Your brain chemistry? That usually takes some time but it will return to normal if you remain clean long enough. We addicts who recovered have all done things that we never thought we would. The grimiest most fucked up shit we never thought we would sink low enough to do. But we recover. We can be reborn. Not in some biblical sense but if thats your thing more power to you. I mean we become a whole new person. My past has changed me but i see it as a positive. I have depth of character. Ive been to some really low places and because of that I appreciate how amazing a normal day without hurting for dope feels. My past gives me insight. It allows me to see the world through a different lens. It gives my life contrast because having been so low being clean and sober feels incredible. Indescribable. I can feel my feelings and although it takes some getting used to oddly enough I am grateful for my past. It makes me who I am today and today I actually love who I am.TLDR No there is no such thing as a bottom too deep. ,OpiatesRecovery,ctyvnkz,2,t5_2tkk8

4938856,0,t3_3ij169,Hey man thats one of the hardest tests someone can face in early recovery. Im over a year clean and Im not even sure if I found a stash if Id have the wherewithal to toss it Im pretty certain Id at least hesitate. Dont beat yourself up a lot od times addicts slip up and feel so much shame and guilt they use more to medicate those feelings of shame and guilt from using! It becomes a vicious cycle. It sounds corny but its hard for most of us addicts to love ourselves definitely harder than beating ourselves up. Its not a relapse though IMO its just a slip you wont have to go through WD but unfortunately you do kinda have to reset your clean day count because if you dont youre essentially deceiving yourself and others and in my experience dishonesty is almost always a precursor to using again.Remember  recovery is about progress not perfection.

Once we start we cant stop it never changes out there we dont get better instead we get worse each time. So your not in hell yet but you are on the train and its going straight to hell. You can get off the train now and start over in recovery. Advantage of now is you probably wont even be that dope sick shit if you get out now it wont be that bad right?If you let it progress three weeks down the road your going to be in the loop man. You want to stop but your just too fucking sick you just need to get right. Wash. Rinse. Repeat...Fast forward three more weeks and your broke sick and demoralized. Your there in your own personal hell. Rob Lie Steal CheatJust remember what it felt like at the bottom of that pit before you got clean. Out of options? Cornered like a fucking animal? I dont know how you felt then but I know you need to know that isnt the lowest you can go. If you see this through towards the dark side it will be worse.Just dont pick up tomorrow. Start over.

This time I credit my success to a much different outlookattitude on recovery but most importantly I told my family and friends about my addiction for the first time and that I wanted to get clean it was emotionally rough but I cant overstate how much having their support has helped me its been a totally different experience this time around..Thanks for the kind words! I really hope you can turn things around for yourself again. It took me over a year and quite a few restarts and relapses just to get to  months. I think the most important thing is to accept what has been done find wisdom rather than shame or regret and move forward.

The amount of Tylenol youre consuming at that rate will kill you before the opiates do. Also dont be ashamed at least not here.

5155512,0,t3_3ll4l6,I think you definitely did the right thing writing this even if its just for your own inner examination or to vent. A big part of turning your life around comes from this kind of inner examination in my opinion.Although I agree with just about  of your reasoning here there is one part that stuck outgtits a band aid for a shitty existence but your existence is shit because of drugsI think that although this statement is relatively true for some people the drugs arent just a bandaid for a shitty existence its much more than that. Also not only is existence shitty because of addictiondrugs alone but most often because of other things as well. For example for me once I did some similar introspection I figured out that really drug use was a way for me to cope with my anxiety disorder so in that case it was sort of like anxiety was what was making my life shitty and so I was using drugs to bandaid that which was only making me more anxious in the long run thus continuing the cycle. So basically what I am getting at here is that sometimes people use addiction as a crutch not only because life is shitty but for the underlying reason that is causing it to be shitty in general outside of drugs. It seems to me that perhaps for you that underlying thing may have to do with family or your upbringing perhaps but thats something you need to figure out still I think if you want the attitude of staying cleanhealthy without substance abuse in the mix. I mean its pretty apparent you havent faced up totally to the underlying causes when you say things like i wish i could be an occasional kind of person i.e. its obvious you still actually want to fill that hole with something stillJust my  cents. Hope you do well in your recovery!,OpiatesRecovery,cv7fjil,2,t5_2tkk8

My suggestion for you is to work the steps with your sponsor and ask them to guide you through your feelings of guilt and regret. Have you done a th step yet? It was very liberating when I did one because just acknowledging things that have happened saying them aloud somehow lessened the burden I was carrying.

I explained to him I was in early recovery from an opiate addiction and he told me that was the cause.

He was very understanding and accepting. We talked about my mental illness in depth too which is apparently schizoaffective disorder. I dont necessarily believe thats the proper diagnosis because I function just like anyone else when Im on my meds but thats what my therapist says.

But through that process the addict is learning what it takes and what it means to get clean whether he ultimately relapses or not. You can usually tell during recovery if their heart is in it. It comes down to a simple question to the addict have you had enough? If the answer is no then I want you to know I can no longer support you or your addiction in any way. They may hit all kinds of rockbottoms but they are the architect of that. Not the family.If the answer is yes then the family and the treatment community can help.,OpiatesRecovery,cyggzqa,1,t5_2tkk8

6200699,0,t3_40hq9a,No one really said it directly but I will say that almost no one myself included stayed in a relationship with a partner they were using with if they were serious about getting clean. Marriages were a little different but if you were using and hooked together at any point then there was inevitably codependency. We learned a lot about codependency and all of the issues that come with being in a newly clean couple. My peer groups encouraged me to leave my boyfriend. My counselors never said that directly but they did say in no uncertain terms that I should not immediately return to the environment that I was using in. They say no relationships in early recovery especially not with someone else in early recovery. This all sounds scary Im sure but they say these things for a reason. Its dangerous to get clean as a couple if one goes down the other one is going down too. The odds of failure double. That doesnt mean your marriage is doomed but it might mean that your wife might need more time than just her rehab stay. Theyll probably encourage her to move into a sober living environment. She should. The more clean time both of you have before you try to go at it together again the better chance you have of making it out together.  ,OpiatesRecovery,cyugblj,2,t5_2tkk8

After youre off blackout period you can make phone calls from the payphone at certain times during the day  but that gets pricey.

They will turn you almost into the person you were before you got hooked on opiates..You will hear people talk behind your back that you are not clean because you are subs who gives a shit about them it is better than what they were saying about you before. I got on subs  years ago. They were pretty newish at the time. I had no idea i should have gone the short term route. I am still on them. I am struggling to get off them. I havent touched dope or pills in a long time. Do not have the desire too. Do not give a shit about them.I was prescribed  mg at first. I burned through them in weeks each time. Then he upped me to  mg. That was better but i still ran out the last week of the month. Finally he got me up to  mg a month. That i could make work. I ate a day sniffed some still basically abused my meds.. But i did everything i was supposed to do in life.I would do the occasional attempt to get high while on them. I never got thrown into withdrawal like people claim. I would just find myself having to do x the normal amount to get a semi high feeling.. I finally gave up on that. Too much money no results... To cocky.. I havent done anything like this for a few years now. No desire. It is a waste..So here i am  years later trying to get off the subs. Tapering down not giving up but it is hard.I would suggest stay at mg or below dose. If it is helping you do not go higher. Stay at  or mg..  some Drs will get you up thereStay on it long enough to get the confidence that you can move forward and get off them and stay clean. I had a delusion that i would be on these forever because it allowed me to maintain. Suboxone is and can be a miracle worker for you. Just respect it. Once you meet more people on it ask them how they feel about going off it. Most of us FEAR that day.,OpiatesRecovery,czovhvf,2,t5_2tkk8

However in an ultra low dose it makes an extremely noticeable difference in wellbeing because it upregulates opioid receptors after about  hours of taking it. ,OpiatesRecovery,czs2mub,1,t5_2tkk8

That way you wont feel a thing and will be able to take care of your businessfamily.Another possibility could be an iboga treatment  quite extreme but that did the job for me I havenT touch any opiates for  years and  months now  even after a couple of surgeries for which I refused the opiates based painkillers... And to be honest  I dont think your situation is great at all it is quite the opposite without any financial problems I found it even harder to quit than the first time when I broke.

6590578,0,t1_d00zrmn,YES..I went to this website helpmegettoffdrugs and it has a taper calculator to figure out your tapering down process. I went from mg in like  weeks and jumped off. In hindsight i might have waited longer but i was feeling crappy at mg and went for it for a few days then a few more days now i am  days. I cannot wait to break this chain  years was way too much suboxone.I used kratom powder and immodium AD. Kratom for  days then stopped.  Immodium is a life saver for when you have to work.It sucked but it was far from the worst withdrawal i have been through. Its been  days. Now i am mostly just tired. Sub withdrawal is just plain irritating annoying but totally doable.I am not sure what triggered me stop i do not want to go into some system as crazy mental health person. I enjoy hunting shooting all this talk of mental health scares me. They can label us addicts anything they want. My Dr was a little shady did not keep digital records so i figured now is the time to stop before i get put on some list i may already be on.,OpiatesRecovery,d010pvk,1,t5_2tkk8

6595877,0,t3_460jov,Some thoughts even though I dont have a ton of experience with benzos benzos do seem to work for most people to help sleep in WD mainly via reducing RLS and causing sedation however as you know they have a huge potential for physical addiction if taken too long so you must be careful. In my experience I limited myself to mg clonazepam per night and only for the first  weeks following my jump after my methadone taper. I found it helped immensely with sleep and I did not have any problems coming off of it I CT it without any issues and my sleeping issues were pretty faded by that time clonidine provides a similar aid to sleep and reduction of RLS without the same level of addiction potential. You may want to consider this if you have the option to see if it will work for you instead of risking it with benzos. For myself I was unable to attain clonidine so thats why I went the benzo option. one thing you need to consider is half life. this is what makes the difference between something like Xanax and Clonazepam. Clonazepam has a much longer half life which means its effects will be more subtle but will last longer for the same mg amount. Generally Xanax will hit you a bit harder but will wear off quicker which could be bad for sleep since it may wear off before you actually got your  hours in. Xanax has a  hour half life whereas clonazepam has about a  hour half life or so. Also Im not really sure but mg seems a bit high for xanax this seems to verify  if you compare relative doses of clonazepam. I would recomend that if you are going to go the benzo route and you do have the option that you try to pursue a benzo that has a higher half life and thus less potential for abuse as well and to take as low a dose as possible. In my experience the sweet spot was right around .mg of clonazepam once daily at bedtime. For Xanax I assume this would be something like .  .mg once at bed and then again  hours later. Basically though what I am getting at is that you want to take the half life into consideration. Personally the rule I have always heard for any benzo this is just general heresay is that you dont want to be on it for more than  weeks anything beyond that and you are risking physical addiction. For this reason Id recomend that if you do want to taper yo ujust do it over the course of  weeks right from the start or else just take a steady dose as low as possible to give you whatever effect you need for . weeks and do a very quick taper following that or none at all. The very upper limit of this is  days anything more than  days of taking it will almost surely leave you with some sort of physical dependence.Good luck in your sobriety! Remember that sickness isnt the only thing you need to learn and change yourself and really want to get sober. Prepare yourself for those situations like finding some or getting gifted and be vigilent about changing your life and youll be fine. Stay strong ,OpiatesRecovery,d01kgef,1,t5_2tkk8

Which I guess it is technically induced by the shot but not a side effect of the shot let me try to explain. You are removing opiates from your system which have helped suppress all emotions for God knows how long and you are now completely vulnerable. Vivitrol is great to stop using but it needs to be coupled with some form of therapy. When opiates were removed from my life I thought I was bipolar depressed crazy af... But in reality I just had deeper issues than drugs. Those issues needed to be worked out before I could feel and form of happinesscontentment. Also PAWS is a thing that will last for a while.

7616229,0,t3_4iyvc3,Yep there with you right now.  Several weeks ago I was sitting in a car in the middle of god knows where waiting for some girl who may or may not have just fallen out in a  rest room and thought there has to be a better way to live life than this.  Im sick of being constantly broke although I make excellent money which is fun to explain dealing with shitty people who you cant never quite be sure arent going to rob you worrying about the police etc.  At the same time  it really does pass the time lol.  Theres a certain bent appeal in the whole endeavor.  Im on the subs right now and the main thing is that they manage to flip the equation.  Normally Id have to maintain constant vigilance  a thirtysecond slip up and I can be on the phone trying to set something up.  Ive already shown myself that I cant keep from slipping consistently enough to avoid that.  I cant really get high while on the subs though.  And even if I say fuck it and start to come off of them its still at least  hours before Im going to be able to get high again.  All Ive got to do in that period is have a single moment of clarity and take another one.  So it helps me gain a little bit of control over myself at least.,OpiatesRecovery,d37xbxi,1,t5_2tkk8

7860062,0,t3_4mvdl6,I got stuck to opiates after my first son was born. After a while I was using to avoid feeling. I had to use to get up and out of bed to get ready for the day. I had to use to avoid snapping at people and being strung outon edge all the time. I used to function. Period. Far different than smoking some pot and just relaxing letting the stresses smoke away. I didnt rely on pot to function the way I did with opiates. I only ever felt normal when I was highIt had become no longer about dulling the phsyical pain as much as it was about numbing the mentalemotional pain that came when I wasnt high. Your perception of rehab is skewed because youre a normie Yes  rehab is not the real world. But a good rehab will try to prepare you for reintegrating to the real world. By the time I went to rehab I had missed out on a year and a half of my sons life. Fact is  when I got clean  I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT DRUGS. I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO BE A FATHER. or a son. or an employee. I didnt know how to function without drugs. It takes time. And patience on your part. Encourage him to go to meetings. SUPPORT HIM. I got married toward the tail end of my addiction before rehab. After rehab she didnt support me going to meeting and whatnot. That was huge for me. The support of my wife mother of my child was essential. I needed her to support me. She didnt. But I continued to go to meetings and stay clean. She filed for divorce. She felt as though I was choosing NA over her....but i looked her dead in the eye one night and asked her if she would rather me go back to stealing her jewelry and shit so I could get high. Go to meetings with him. But please dont turn ur back on him. Its a processes. It takes time. And work. Theres staying clean and then there is recovering. Staying clean is simply keeping drugs out of your body. Recovering is him changing his lifestyle to become a better person.

7917863,0,t3_4nowxo,Youll get the light back but it does take time and herculean effort. The first  months are quite difficult. For me my brain forced me to think about opiates and how I could obtain them almost . It was torture of the highest degree. Everyone has moments of weakness so IMO its extremely important to cut yourself off from those who can supply you as much as possible and keep yourself busydistracted. I mean even moving if necessary. Its now been a little over a year for me and I dont have cravings or think about them anymore. It depends on you and your brain chemistry but I would say youre looking at around a year before you really get back to feeling somewhat like your old self. From my experience long term opiate abuse fucks your brain chemistry up WAY more than most researchers seem to realize. Im not saying that to scare you but to set realistic expectations.

8258579,0,t1_d59uhqg,Of course it will honey! At homeostasis the body isnt designed to sweat profusely. It only sweats in a negative feedback loop when hot in effort to cool you down.Being on opiates just changes your homeostatic baseline. It takes a little bit of time to return to the normal baseline.  there are welldocumented studies by NCBI that document this return to baseline in patients with prolonged opiate use!The more distance you put yourself from that last opiate you took the far better you will feel.Getting connected with a recovery groupcommunity makes the process A LOT easier too from a mental standpoint. I think theres a lot of psychosomatic shit that goes on with recovery. For instance last time I went through wds they didnt seem so bad because my mind was busy with talking to other recovering addicts. Rather than going omfg this will never fucking end  did I destroy myself  I want to use to end this feeling  I started saying another day down another day closer to getting well! Another day my brain got to healand the symptoms are getting better everydayI think I can do this!!!,OpiatesRecovery,d59vo8g,3,t5_2tkk8

In vivitrol use there is a bell curve where it is in high amounts in your system but then starts to taper off toward the end of the month rd week.  Because of this many people need a supplemental oral dose in the transitional time from end of the month to beginning of the next month.   Not sure what dental work you are having done and how extensive it is but studies have shown mg ibuprofen motrin is as or more effective than lots of narcotics for dental pain.  tramadoldont do it.  it has abuse potential especially in addicts plus the vivitrol and naltrexone will affect its pain management ability.  Make sure you tell your dentist you are a recovering addict dont lie or sugar coat it to him he needs to know so he wont prescribe something that will cause you to fall back into addiction.  again get to a doctor to get back on seroquel or any meds you might need for your bipolar because you are risking a relapse.

Even through this it may not be that individuals bottom. It varies widely for each individual but I can tell you that most times if there is nothing to break or interrupt the cycle of using and euphoria and WD then they will continue.

8882655,0,t3_51gmk6,Many people get therapists just to handle addiction.  I had one for awhile when I was quitting IV drugs and later methadone.  It helped.  I would tell the therapist so you can start working on issues that led to the addiction and start learning coping strategies to prevent relapse.  It also helps just to let things out.  Your therapist cant tell anyone by law even your doctor.  The only way your therapist can tell someone is if they think you are an immediate threat to yourself or others and addiction and relapse rarely qualifies.  Also if you dont like the way your therapist handles the situation you can always get a new therapist.  They arent assigned to you for life or anything.

9523506,0,t3_5b7mfn,Good topic bro! I personally have never tried kratom  so this is just going to be my thoughts on it. So as most of you are aware Im taking suboxone .... And I consider myself clean. If kratom as u said keeps you waiting for that next hit I think its just switching one drug for another. Now dont get me wrong I understand  that suboxone has opioids in it and if I was to stop taking it I would wd but that being said I take it once a day and dont think about or need it until the following morning I dont get high off of it at all . If you have to carry around bags of kratom with u I think its just as bad as dope minus the needles and whatnot. Now I do agree that its less damaging than H so in that aspect I agree with you if someones trying to get of the spike than hell yes go with the kratom. I guess I would consider it like MAT but I have different feelings about methadone and suboxone so I would put kratom in the methadone category .... Now again I have never even seen Kratom so I dont know if it gives u a high or not  thats why I would put it with the methadone if it does. Idk bro good question !

9593636,0,t1_d9u81m8,MMA is grueling which is why its impossible to sustain while in active addiction. Wrestling is heavily anaerobic uses muscle endurance and stresses the CNS while striking is predominantly aerobic V conditioning  lung and respiratory endurance. Thats why its so hard because you have to develop two energy systems and use them interchangeably.I have a bad habit of smoking when Im drinking and doing opiates which gives me burning lungs when I do endurance but unfit people who dont ever smoke will get that anyway. Just a few days off from all the vices and my lungs adjust back to normal. I just have to push through it for the first few days.This is coming from someone who would run .km in  minutes when hungover so that gives you an idea of the physical fitness you need to hang with ammy and pro fighters in MMA. But addiction would always separate me from those who lived clean lifestyles.Youd be amazed at how quickly your body can heal and adjust to physical stresses. I can go from nothing and physically shot back to near full form in  weeks if I stay straight and train every day. Getting to that physical form when youve never had it is obviously a much longer haul but if you stick to training your conditioning will adjust accordingly.

9643419,0,t1_da1gure,Listen to slippy this is the truth.  If you think about it it makes sense how long did you use for?  How long were your emotions buried how long since you had to deal with them?  How long has your brains reward system been cross wired and its homeostasis unbalanced?  These things will not heal overnight or over a month but they do keep improving bit by bit day by day until you start waking up feeling good again you have energy again.  When life happens and life always happens we will always have challenges the emotional roller coaster is manageable you will have rebuilt the coping mechanisms that using made you forget.It can be difficult when we get through withdrawals weve stopped using we did everything right!  Yet improvement seems to elude us.  We still feel like shit life still feels unmanageable our emotions are all over the place.  We have to remember that we used for years recovery is going to take time too.  We did a lot of damage to our brain to our reward pathways to our emotional fitness and just like an atrophied muscle we have to exorcize our ability to handle emotions our brains capacity to release endorphins naturally allow time for homeostasis to return.  Patience is not a familiar virtue for most of us addicts recovery helps teach it to us.  This is where lifestyle is huge exorcize eat well drink a lot of water engage in activities and with a support community.  These will all help kickstart your recovery and help the healing process.  You can do this.  Good luck!,OpiatesRecovery,da1r0zl,3,t5_2tkk8
9716072,0,t1_da9kavw,Yeah gabapentin and pregabalin gave me a weird reaction. I had extremely vivid strange dreamsnightmares for the first two nights. It also made me foggy and dim for about  hours. But it cures restlessness like nothing else so it was worth it at that point. Having crazy dreams was better than not sleeping. Id take mg of valium during the night to try and knock myself out but the restlessness would override any relief. Valium and gaba together with a bit of loperamide to cure the runs and all I really had to deal with were cold sweats and chills.If hes going to try OTC remedies tell him to pick up a bottle of dry cough syrup with dextromethorphan as the main ingredient. x the regular dose gives you relief from all of the opiate WD symptoms not complete relief but it certainly helps in a real way that OTC supplements wont. Its weird how many people dont know about the effectiveness of NDMA antagonists for helping the brain recover from opiate and benzo addiction. DXM is the only one available OTC.Like I said hes made it this far and dilaudid is a relatively short halflife opiate so he should be most of the way through the physical WD.

I mean alcohol nicotine cocaine opiates hallucinogens cannabis etc.  Number  people have a vulnerability to addiction and it probably ranges from  of all users.  Those stats are debatable.  But most people can use any of the chemicals and use them with impunity.  Codeine and morphine are highly regulated yet anyone can go to an organic food store or go on a seed website and order poppy seeds and get high?  Doesnt make sense.

There are complicated neurological processes at work in addiction and opiate addiction in particular is tough because it wreaks so much havok on the dopaminereward system the prefrontal cortex and the central nervous system.

I was simply sharing my opinion that there should be a good reason for trying to get someone arrested  whatever that reason may be good is relative to the person. Trying to get them arrested because you cant stop using is like burning down the liquor store because you cant stop drinking like uSteveisverycool said. It doesnt make sense.Now if someone were to get arrested and as part of a plea deal had to turn in a dealer or two that I understand. Youre doing it for a good reason  to keep yourself out of a system that has failed everyone who has entered it in this country. I dont think that my life or time is more important than a dealers. If the dealer didnt want to have to deal with potential snitching then he or she shouldnt have been dealing in the first place. Ive never dealt in my life so I dont have first hand experience being one dealing what they deal with so take this all with a grain of salt. However I do think that dealing is reprehensible especially with shit getting cut with fentanyl and carfentanyl these days a dealer could very possibly kill someone.

Even if you are out of the group and no connects life stable seeming well its just always there. My condolences.  And as someone who recently lost a relationship to alcohol I suggest you avoid building a relationship with anyone with addiction issues.  Its a terrible way to live with and next to someone elses pain.   ,OpiatesRecovery,dbzbi8o,7,t5_2tkk8

I have two meniscal tears arthritis in my neck reoccurring back pain.  Fun stuff. Opiates make me feel physically much better except I dont want to use them.I dont have an answer.  Cannabis kinda works.  NSAIDs sort of work.  Lyrics sorta helps made me gain weight though.  Im in a better headspace off opiates so thats a plus.  Enough THC and a hot shower with ibuprofen and I feel good for a few hours.,OpiatesRecovery,dc6zdfb,2,t5_2tkk8
10312004,0,t1_dccp9ic,Im going to differ somewhat from the popular rhetoric on addiction in what I say here Im not sure that my advice is going to differ substantially from what youve already been told but I feel compelled to offer my own thoughts because your situation reminds me a lot of what I put someone very close to me through for a long time.The common addage is that an addict has to hit rock bottom or very close to it before theyll get clean that as our friend above says nothing you can say or do will make a difference. I dont believe thats true for a second. Even though all addicts suffer from essentially the same problem people recover from addiction in diverse and varied circumstances substance of choice and intensity of use can complicate things but people recover with the help of friends and family alone more often than youd think  and at all stages of addiction. Whilst it sounds like your friend is sadly not going to take the option right now it doesnt necessarily mean it will never be the case.It might seem difficult to believe and its obviously hard to say anything for certain when I know so little about your situation but I dont doubt everything youve done has counted  your friend may have well been in a worse situation if not for what youve done to try and help them through the years. I know in a way that can be even more frustrating than feeling like you cant do anything because it invites the worry that maybe you should have somehow done more but I think its important to acknowledge that yes other people can break through the addiction. Its just down to the addict how they deal with that break through whether they embrace it or shun it.And what is true is that you arent responsible for their decisions. Its not your fault if they decide they want to go and use and it is not remotely unreasonable to have hard lines around honesty and stopping use if youre going to be part of their life and help them in their recovery.Actually I think it is absolutely essential that the condition of your help is that they have to be actively trying to get clean. You cant drag them down the path to recovery because only they know the way the road is going to unfold. You can walk right behind them or alongside them but they have to lead the way. They can be stumbling or struggling and you can hold them up but they have to keep their legs moving. Otherwise you just both end up walking back into the darkness  you into the hurt of betrayal and being used again them into active addiction. Perhaps most importantly you have to help yourself first. You cant be a pillar of strength for someone else to lean on if your own core is crumbling theres a limit to what anyone can expect you to bear no matter how deep your love for this person is. Theres a difference between saying to them do what you want get high I dont care and I cant tolerate you using because I love you too much and it hurts too much to watch.You can be the person who will help them figure out what treatment program might work. You can be the person who can drive them wherever they need to be to get better. You can be the person who helps them work through whatever drove them into abuse in the first place when theyre getting clean. You can be the one person in the world they know they can turn to if they finally crack and want to get clean again. But you cant force them to take the steps they need to take you can only give them very good reasons why they should take them and as I think you already know you do more harm than good to both of you if you fall back into enabling them. If theyre going to use make clear that you cant tolerate it because you love them  because you want to help your friend but not the person that the drugs make them.They ultimately have to chose between you and any other good in their life and continuing to use. If you have the strength you can keep that choice there for them to make it at any time and you can be on the periphery of their life so they always have someone to turn to when theyre sincere. But they have to reach out to take any hand thats on offer.Ive no idea if this helps at all its am and Im probably totally incoherent I just saw your threads and saw a lot of someone very dear to me in your words and experiences. You seem like a fantastic person and Im so sorry that things are turning out this way. I really really really hope your friend comes around gets clean and gets to thank you properly one day themselves for everything youve done for them. When I was in your friends shoes some of the precious few moments of joy I had in my life came from the love and support of the person in my life who was playing your role. Maybe if nothing else youve been able to do something similar for them. And I know if thats the case then its a really really shitty consolation prize but it also means everything wasnt completely in vain.,OpiatesRecovery,dccx716,3,t5_2tkk8
10338094,0,t3_5o19oo,Its really frustrating to be in the situation that we are in. We are back to normal in that we are no longer active drug addicts so we can see more clearly but there are many complications and problems to deal with now.The sadness is good because it means you are no longer hiding from those problems by using and it means you care and are trying to fix things.I cant advise from experience but I imagine that the most important thing is to make sure your children understand that you are still there for them and you love them. Make sure they understand the situation and that there is nothing to be scared of.Work hard to get things back to normal properly and be patient. You will get there. Maybe your children will benefit in the long term from these challenging experiences as long as they know they are loved and life will soon get better.Good luck and love to you all.,OpiatesRecovery,dcfvqk4,3,t5_2tkk8

10424349,0,t3_5ondvu,I wouldnt recommend subs for where you are especially from a doctor who is telling you to be ready to be on them forever. You have to keep in mind that it is still a business and some doctors will start you on way to high a dose and keep you there. Taken at the correct dose you should not notice them at all. Maybe with the exercise go a little lighter and for a little less time than you would normally. Your testosterone might be down a touch from using and that will take some time to come back not to mention your natural pain relief system is likely out of wacky and needs time to heal. So even your normal workout will hurt more and take longer to recover from.Youre well on your way at this point I personally would avoid getting on a replacement opiate as it will just drag out the process. Especially subs since the half life is so much longer.Good luck to ya though. Stay strong.,OpiatesRecovery,dcpo3ci,2,t5_2tkk8

10585953,0,t3_5ritj7,Speaking from my own experience any form of benzo use in recovery is a bad idea for the most part. I only day for the most part because there is always an exception to every rule.But going off my own experience benzos seemed to be the magical cureall during my detox. They got me through the long restless nights and stopped withdrawal induced anxiety dead in its tracks. I remember thinking to myself at one point shit I could just take my benzos as prescribed and be ok. Which was the same thing I told myself with my first Norco script. Luckily enough for me I was able to kick the benzos after about a months use. But I can say this kicking a  day benzo habit was far worse than kicking a  year opiate addiction.Benzos are an extremely dangerous drug to kick and unlike opiates it is not recommended to kick them without medical supervision. Ive known people with very serious dependence on benzos and it is not pretty. Ive had to jump on someones lap and steer her car to safety because she had a seizure while driving. I myself have done very embarrassing things including a weekend long shoplifting spree while completely blacked out.If youre an addict like me its just a road you dont want to take trust me. Its a progressive addiction just like the opiates. It always gets worse.,OpiatesRecovery,dd7uyla,7,t5_2tkk8

Its not my place to tell you that you cant actually. I know I couldnt. When in this spot I had to reach out to clean people whove done it. Youre post is exactly that. Youre head and hopefully heart are in the right place. My major suggestion is to reach out in person. Google for a local number. You should know what Im talking about. They dont judge. I was terrified the first time I reached out for help. I had to have a friend go with me. In the end it eventually worked. Getting clean depends on you. How willing you are. But if I sit here in my head and just let my mind run in manic circles I can tell you exactly what Id end up doing and I never make a good decision alone. You shouldnt have to be alone either through this. Feel free to message me more of you want to talk. I just also suggest you find someone locally. Only a suggestion.

10701523,0,t3_5svgwy,Did you start the subs yet mate and if so how did it go? I always found the best method was to just wait until I cant bare it anymore then take a small amount of sub and wait half hour and go from there. I only ever had precipitated withdrawal from subs once and that was when switching from methadone. Every other time when switching from a short acting opiate I would take the sub the day after last use and was fine every time I even have inducted after waiting only  hours and I was fine. I am pretty sure that as long as you are not methadone dependant then if you wait till the day after last use and wait as long as you can hold out you will be fine. If you have not inducted yet then dont worry if worse possible outcome happens as precipitated withdrawal is terrible but passes within a hour or so and if you start by taking half a mg you should be ok.

10792356,0,t3_5ucjah,Hey man you can do this. I got clean on November th from a  year tram habit. At my highest I was using  mg plus like g of kratom a day. Im now  days clean of the trams which I kicked CT while maintaining the kratom habit and then like  days later I started tapering the kratom. I finally jumped off the kratom about one month ago. So while I luckily didnt get to the doses youre jumping from I still had to go through the hell of kicking a moderately high tram dose over a long period of time no less and then immediately get off kratom a  year habit concurrent with the trams doses depended on where I was at with my monthly script but varied from like g.Anyhow. I am going to be completely one hundred percent honest with you. You will feel like absolute garbage for awhile. Its impossible to say how long because that depends on things both out of your control your preopioidSNRI baseline and general brain chemistry and physiology and things in your control diet and exercise sleep supplements and meds that can help your intake of other psychoactive drugs and perhaps most importanly IMO a strong support system. Luckily for you even though you had a very long hydro habit your doses were pretty small tbh and while your tram doses were massive its only been a few months if I read your post right. What I would strongly suggest is going to a doctor and going on a low dose of an SSRI. Not an SNRI that shit is hellish to kick been there done that. But a low dose of something like Lexapro would probably help enormously. Id have probably killed myself in that first week if I hadnt gone on a small dose of Lexapro. What you gotta remember is that your body is going through SNRI WD along with opioid withdrawal. Your situation is unique bc you were on a moderate dose of hydro for a loooong time and then jumped to a huge dose of a weaker opioid but also a massive dose of a very potent SNRI. A good doctor would probably be able to help you plan how to attack the PAWS better than I can but I have plenty of not a doctor tho pointers based on how my  days have gone.I will stop rambling now but Ill leave you with some encouragement. I will be blunt  this shit is fucking hard. This has been the most difficult battle of my life no doubt. But the first day you wake up when the acute shit is gone and you realize that you dont have to eat some pills that you wont be sick til they kick in...man thats a good feeling. The cravings have already become increasingly rare for me. The PAWS which in my case seems to be more fueled by the SNRI component tbh has been very very hellish but I seem to be slowly starting to come around. I regret all the time I fucked my brain up with those god damn pills. Even in this period of darkness I do not wish to go back to those days. I have access to trams albeit only frequently enough to chip although Im quite sure I could go back and get a script and start where I left off again....yet something even though I frequently feel like garbage something holds me back. And I believe in you OP. You will get to that point where something keeps you from making that drive to pick up. You will be happy and motivated again without the pills. Promise. PM me anytime if you need anything seriously I am always here to help. You got this.,OpiatesRecovery,ddt5lpj,2,t5_2tkk8

Best of luck! ,OpiatesRecovery,dg1k575,2,t5_2tkk8

11564437,0,t1_dg6tw64,I have been them on two years first year at mg second year tapering down to mg. So you may be right about that. Still I think OP should do their own research before committing to something as serious as maintenance meds.,OpiatesRecovery,dg6u1dt,1,t5_2tkk8

11643964,0,t1_dgfqjjf,Hells yeah! Just a whacky cycle. Your body is adjusting to new chemical stasis. Its crazy when the cycle does something out of the ordinary and youre freaked the fuck out. Its an awesome feeling to know youre not preggers when you dont wanna be!!! Lol!!! Note to self dont google things. Hooray qui!,OpiatesRecovery,dgfuv0j,2,t5_2tkk8

11652535,0,t3_66425f,Oh maybe it had something to do with drugs? I havent had it since when I was actively using a lot... maybe more often when entering withdrawal Im not really sure about that never great at connecting dots re my addiction. I do know my first experience w it was when quitting alcohol after a bad bender. I have no idea what to say otherwise except that if youre like me maybe it will stop happening after a chunk of clean time... I have  days now but the  majority of the last  months.,OpiatesRecovery,dggtv2x,2,t5_2tkk8
11668589,0,t1_desjki9,Its the opposite for me. I see the posts and I think maybe Im strong enough to try it just once and then never again . Hopefully I never do.  ,OpiatesRecovery,dginf0c,3,t5_2tkk8
11688279,0,t1_dgkby21,At least youre feeling well enough to post. I couldnt post anything on day  I would just be too emotional and wanting to hide. Good luck youre on the up from here.I relate to some things you quoted there. Withdrawal sucks so bad it is the reason for the madness and unreasonability of addiction essentially.,OpiatesRecovery,dgkvuag,3,t5_2tkk8

11728120,0,t1_dgpepne,No. I would love to say Yes and it felt so liberating! But youre a stranger on the internet that cant make me so Ill tell you the truth. I kept it. And I know thats a shitty thing to do but it gives me some peace of mind tbh that if I really needed to I could find something and its me actively choosing not to that is keeping me sober. Again still realizing its a mistake probably. ,OpiatesRecovery,dgpevmd,4,t5_2tkk8
11731482,0,t3_66ck8a,Good lord do not take suboxone.  That is just another hole to climb out of.  I replaced opiates with bodybuilding I feel fucking fantastic.  I dont even think about them anymore which I honestly didnt believe was possible.,OpiatesRecovery,dgpslav,1,t5_2tkk8
11760111,0,t1_dgstzhq,Thank you it really does. Ive lost some weight been eating better and channelling my addiction to riding my bike. Being outside and feeling the sun and smelling the world does alot for the soul. ,OpiatesRecovery,dgt1e1a,3,t5_2tkk8
11791397,0,t1_dgrhz17,A dual diagnosis mental illness and drug addiction is a really frustrating situation. For treatment meds or therapy to be effective you need to be away from the drugs to figure out what your emotional baseline is without the drugs in the picture. A lot of professionals refuse to take on patients in this situation referring you to treatment programs or therapists specifically trained in addiction.Going through this right now myself. I have bipolar disorder and the seasonal depression got to be overwhelming so I decided to start using again secretly hoping I would die in the process. I no longer want to take my life but am still having issues with depression and above all else hating the person Ive become. I realized I needed help and started seeing a therapist but when it was business time for me to quit everything I ran away. She informed me that if I want to come back I need to be actively committed to sobriety.It hurt and I blamed her and lots of other people for what is really my fault. Yes there are coping skills I lack and poisonous mindsets that can lead me to use and I felt I needed to have answers to those issues before I could deal with quitting. But if I am not ready to dedicate myself to getting better on this end first I never have any hope of being happy.Been reading a lot of addiction posts on Reddit and theyve been hitting me hard. I relate to so much of it I am watching a lot of my socalled friends ruin their lives by following the same path and I can tell I am starting to fuck up my life again.I always want to finish that baggie before I quit but I think Im ready to throw it out now. I need to check out some  step meetings to build a support system above all I just need to take care of myself.Im glad I found this community I feel a little more hopeful and interested in discovering what loving myself feels like. Ill probably be posting a few times this week as I out my plan into action,OpiatesRecovery,dgwlexz,1,t5_2tkk8
