6548663,0,t3_45bx2u,Hey guys!    So for what Ive heard in general many of you who knew about my maps liked Rainfall a lot... well Ive decided that now that the workshop is available Id rather rework and update it a bit because I think it was much needed. So thats that! Hopefully youll like the new and Improved Rainfall!  Let me know what your scores are! I only tried to complete it once for now and got  V ,cobalt,czwoomt,1,t5_2ra24
