3182358,0,t3_2wkyq2,I hope they do take a more craft beer approach rather then like youre saying sell out to one major beer label. But the reality is that those major brands will fork over a lot of money to be the exclusive brewer. On the flip side to that though theyre not going to have much luck selling me  cans of Molson when I have  cans at my campsite. They need something extra like craft brewers to make it worth peoples dime. Its the same  decision they need to make for everything should they name the stages something cool that will live on each year like Bonnaroo This That Which What The Other or sell the fuck out like Osheaga Molson Canadian Mountain Stage Virgin Mobile River Stage CocaCola Valley Stage Honda Piknic Electronik and of course the Garnier Fructis Green Stage powered by Sennheiser.

So if the original buyer ever shows up and claim their wristband was lost or stolen even if youre already in the event theyll kill your wristband remotely and reissue to the original person who can demonstrate they actually paid.  At that point you wont be able to get back into the event and the festival wont do anything for you as they have no record you every actually purchased a ticket.

I was shocked at gentleman of the road that out of the entire campsite area there were only say  shade tents with most people just sitting out in the sun.Also all shade tents are not made equal you want one that has a uv liner as that is what will keep it cool underneath. We always have reusable water bottles for ourselves but bring a base of bottled water just to give to people that need them and are obviously unprepared.

5720456,0,t1_cx62ul2,Firefly is relatively close remember people travel from far distances and it is rougly around the same time. People who live in northern New York or Pennsylvania are aproximately halfway between the the two. In an interview the organizers said people had come from  US States and  foreign countries so there is definitely an international audience. I agree Osheaga is more of a competitor because it is closer in both time and distance but there is still people wbo will choose between Wayhome and Firefly. As for the other Toronto area fests I feel like they are more competing with each other. They are all smaller festivals and not on the same scale as Wayhome. Ill be going to Wayhome and also one of Field Trip Bestival or Turf. That could just be my way of thinking though. ,wayhome,cx66g9w,2,t5_366d1

6726842,0,t3_47qbxg,Shannon was a key figure in making WayHome happen. But his purpose may have been served now that the festival is a reality. He provided the impetus to get the ball rolling and brought the right people together but once that was taken care of... was there still a need for him? WayHome would not be here without AC Entertainment. Shannon wanted to put on a rock festival from the getgo but big rock acts had no interest in playing a brand new festival put on by some unknown Canadian promoter. He went down the country path because those acts did not care if Republic Live was brand new they just wanted the cash. Republic Live paid the country stars played and that got the ball rolling. Stan and Eva Dunford who Shannon brought into the picture supplied the cash and later the land. This gets ACs attention. Year two sees the Dunford cash combined with the AC talentbooking power and Republic Live handling the logistics. We may never get an answer on why Shannon left but when you break it down like this its not hard to see why the two sides may have parted. ,wayhome,d0f44bq,3,t5_366d1

I have no idea whether they were on time because Lauryn Hill was  mins late so it shifted everything over anyway. At Riotfest the only heavies who showed up were GZA and RZA unfortunately. And Raekwon freaking lives in Toronto.,wayhome,de2y0q5,1,t5_366d1

10950992,0,t3_5wej93,The obvious answer would be that youre really into the hip hop genre and this year is more catered to that. I would say that most people on reddit are more into indierock so this years lineup was a disappointment for them. Also because Wayhome originally started out as the Bonnaroo of Canada so people sort of have a image for what they expect the lineup to be based on how Wayhome advertised themselves the previous two years. To be honest I dont think I would have been as disappointed in the lineup if I wasnt on this sub everyday leading up to the leak I was looking forward to a couple rumoured artists that were not on the lineup and everyone elses disappointment really influenced me to feel a certain way about the lineup as well. I think it also depends on what your Wayhome crew likes as well I know some people are having trouble convincing their friends to go this year because other festivals are more tailored to their tastes. Luckily my group also like hip hop and edm my friends are so excited for Frank and Schoolboy Q so we are still very excited about going. Wayhome was also very accommodating with getting back to me about a free campsite I got tickets during midnight madness and therefore couldnt get the campsite bundle All in all for my crew and I Wayhome is our solace and we have the best time there every summer This year should be no different. Ive been enjoying discovering new artists from the lineup on Spotify and Im counting down the days to Wayhome . PLUS I still have hope for their additions ,wayhome,de9imq7,9,t5_366d1

11085413,0,t1_deoh8tz,When I say community I mean the people AT the Festival... I go to Bonnaroo each year and fully support Coffee County any way possible while Im there. The small vocal portion of Oro have made their voices heard and Im sorry but I cannot shed a tear for them after the blatant campaign of lies they set out on.    I get that Oro doesnt want the people there... but guess what... theres a lot of people doing a lot of things I dont approve of in everyday life. But I suck it up because those things make those people happy. If you dont want to put up with a group of happy people for  days of the year then thats fine... but dont expect people to treat you like youve been slighted in the worst way when theres a lot of worse shit going on in the world. Youve witnessed the backlash SaveOro has caused. Theres been countless people here apologizing for the few bad apples that got all bent out of shape over this. In no way outside of the Oro community does anyone side with those beliefs.,wayhome,deoisn0,4,t5_366d1

11491116,0,t1_dfyi3vi,Which Marriott did you stay at? We had friends stay at two different Marriotts for Dead and they loved them. We stayed at Hotel Chicago to explore the city owned by Marriott but a signature series it was pricey but we found a great deal on a Groupon. For the actual dead we stayed at the Hyatt that was the closest hotel to the show soldier field but far away from everything it was exciting walking around the south side to get to a White Castle at am though...yes exciting lol,wayhome,dfyim2z,2,t5_366d1
