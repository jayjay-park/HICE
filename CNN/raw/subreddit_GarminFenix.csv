10116782,0,t1_dbpz5ak,The IQ store is literally just an App Store for your watch just like the AppStore for your phone. Its not a standalone app though it lives in the Garmin Connect app. Essentially you download an app for the watch then in installs the next time you sync it to your phone. What exactly is wrong with GPS ABC and step accuracy? Are you having trouble acquiring satellites or what? For step accuracy make sure its tight on your wrist. If it wobbles or shakes at all while walking or running itll mess up your steps. Also any hand movements that are similar to the motion made while walking brushing teeth driving putting stuff on shelves will impact your step count. Its best to think of it as a close estimate rather than an exact count. For GPS make sure youre in an area clear of objects obstructing the sky like roofs or trees. Make sure you arent moving and allow it to actually acquire satellites before you start an activity. For ABC you may want to set altitude by GPS. The barometer is used to determine altitude but as the atmospheric pressure changes with the weather the exact altitude can get out of whack. ,GarminFenix,dbq83d6,2,t5_390zi
10196580,0,t3_4zen2b,Great posting thanks.  I am looking for a silver bezel to replace my black fenix bezel hard to find. I have HR and standard fenix.,GarminFenix,dbzu7an,1,t5_390zi
10319694,0,t3_5nrlgq,I wear the F at work sometimes. My only issue is my shirt cuffs will barely fit over it. This is with the silicone band. The metal band adds even more bulk. YMMV. The watch isnt all that large in diameter but its quite thick.  Ill wear my regular Seiko Sportua if Im needing to dress more formal as its a much cleaner look. When running I dont notice it. Silicone band again... for me the metal band is stupidly heavy. ,GarminFenix,dcdslag,5,t5_390zi

11128024,0,t1_desljb1,For something like that you are best off emailing Runkeeper amp mapmyruns support. Not sure about runkeeper but map my run is fairly responsive.,GarminFenix,detcol6,1,t5_390zi
