2844090,0,t3_2sn4i5,My gut reaction is that the horizon is curving slightly upwardinstead of downwardbecause it was probably taken with a wideangle lens and then cropped.Or you know its just a view from the Plateau of Leng and it has the nonEuclidian geometry of star spawn.,WQHD_Wallpaper,cnrddxk,1,t5_2xvf5
4357555,1,t3_3axcux,Having taken part in the Digg exodus and judging by Reddits recent behavior and troubling blog posts I see it as increasingly likely something similar will happen. Therefore I thought Id claim a place in the most likely competitor for Reddit now. I hope it doesnt happen though and that Reddit starts to act in ways that make it regain its reputation would be sad to lose all that karma I couldnt choose WQHDWallpaper as a name because special characters such as  are not allowed. Might actually have been a better name for this sub too as p turned out to be a more common term than WQHD and easier to pronounce to.Not really planning on doing anything with it for now. Though feel free to post or mirror some of this subs submissions there if you are a Voat user.,WQHD_Wallpaper,csgtvmk,1,t5_2xvf5
