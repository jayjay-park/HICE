Your best bet is to get used to it honestly. After all thats what friends are for. You accept someone for who they are barring addictionslife threatening things and they will do the same for you.Its hard to say  or give any tangible advice because honestly its NOT a problem. Some people just talk constantly others are really quiet. Thats all I can say.,YoungAdvice,cuc5a1y,1,t5_39kes
