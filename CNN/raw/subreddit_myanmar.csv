Because Myanmar doesnt have a functioning public stock market investment options for the class of people earning  USD or more per month are limited. The result is a massive real estate bubble both residential and commercial. Small business owners who rent their buildings are at a huge disadvantage to businesses that own their buildings. Unimproved land away from the cities yet likely to be developed is still available. The folks earning  a month are snapping these plots of land as fast as possible. ,myanmar,cykt9al,1,t5_2rt95
