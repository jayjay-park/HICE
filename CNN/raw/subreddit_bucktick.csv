5645152,0,t1_cwwt5jv,Oh my story is much like yours except it happened sometime in high school instead of uni. Male vocalists liking Florence Muse classic rock  In my case there were also Patrick Wolf and Andrew Bird though  long live weird pop music! I never stopped liking this music really I just... forgot about it? Around the time I found Mr. Bowie he was a big obsession so for a while I was only listening to him and related artists The VU amp Lou Reed those two Iggy Pop records he cowrote Klaus Nomi Scott Walker... In a way he did a good job wiping my musical slate clean. And now of course Im majorly obsessing over BT as well as picking up other random artists I like like Mr. Tibet. A couple of weeks ago YouTube recommended me to listen to Uprising again it is still so cool! Perhaps I should remind myself of some of that music again.,bucktick,cwwu3b4,2,t5_3anuh

9882138,0,t1_davnohc,Ah I hadnt realised  I just figured nobody was interested.  Perhaps perhaps not  Japanese tend to be funny with their copyrights given their history of doujinshi and such! Besides it says inspired by so its more of an artistic stretch as I see it. ,bucktick,davnzoo,3,t5_3anuh
