168119,0,t1_cexhpmu,The issue of the morality of involuntary confinement is independent of methods for detecting risk I think.  We as a society are already decided that involuntary confinement is ok on a temporary basis to try to treat acute suicidality.  If this method can make detection more precise thats good I would think so long as there is not a false positive problem.,suicidology,cexkyn2,2,t5_2shhl

Reddit bans any subreddits that allow discussions of methods to commit suicide.That being said your kit is pretty high risk overdosing is an incredibly dangerous way that will likely leave you with some pretty nasty health consequences if you fail. I personally would suggest looking into an entirely different method but if youre dead set on it I hope those sleeping pill are really high dose.,suicidology,cs4pqsn,9,t5_2shhl
4356005,0,t3_386215,Simple you have no right to take your own life. As mad as it may seem your life belongs not only to you but to the society which you are a member of. Hence it would be undutiful for you to take your own life. I would add that similar to the functioning of a human body if people started to kill themselves left and right it would become the end of civilization itself and not merely the end of this or that particular person. In an actual person this would take the form of an autoimmune disease. You might retort that in a human body cells die all of the time. Well yes those cells are not unlike those persons who die of natural causes such as old agedisease etc. For healthy cells to begin to die off would be odd and outright dangerous for you and mankind. Hence suicide is selfishunless you are very sick andor disabled.,suicidology,csgnkxy,-2,t5_2shhl

Unless you have an incurable disease or something thats going to cut your life short you have the potential to live to . Those people would have plenty of time to try to recover or find a way that helps them. Theyre thinking that its not likely youre going to suffer for the rest of your life because theres so much more time that things could change. Whether life gets better or worse for some or most of suicidal people I cannot say but there is a lot of time left for a lot of these people if they choose not to end it early. And even if you exhaust all your options that doesnt mean there arent any left its just there arent any youre aware of.I used the phrase you just to make things easier to understand. I still dont think its selfish for someone to kill themselves if thats how they truly feel but at least understand the other side.,suicidology,d2ettk2,1,t5_2shhl
8167439,0,t1_d4yet37,About DBT Im sure youre right that its not a magic cure. But if it reduces repeat suicide attempts by  thats pretty good. There are two reasons I sort of latched on to DBT without knowing a whole lot about it . Because of the studies that show it reduces repeat suicide attempts by  and . Because it focuses on changing your thinking and eventually your life and on balancing change with radical acceptance blending Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  with Zen principles which have been very helpful to me personally  this audio in particular  by Cheri Huber who Im pretty sure is the female Zen master in California who Dr. Linehan often refers to who taught her the Zen principles she used to create DBT many years ago.  Since many of the  or so people who visit Suicide Watch each day leave just as hopeless as they came  and some of them go on to kill themselves  I believe every attempt should be made to reach them with whatever the most effective online treatment is whether its DBT or something else About suicide fixing a persons problems... Since Ive been increasingly suicidal myself over the last number of years believe me I very often believe the most effective solution to my own problems would be to stop existing So its not that I dont believe suicide has the ability to end a persons problems including my own. I know it does. Thats why its hard not to think about it and want it sometimes desperately. Its that I know the end of my problems will be just be the beginning of a bunch of new problems and serious pain for my kids and to some degree  and by extension through the kids  my former wife as well.Sometimes when Im really suicidal I basically cut them off in my mind and try to equate them with all the other millions of people who suffer in this world whose lives I have no part of. And I think about the fact that once Im gone Ill cease to exist and NO ONE ELSES problems will be of any concern to me including my own kids problems.But the fact remains that kids I helped bring in to the world will not only suffer because of my suicide they will also be more likely to attempt or commit suicide themselves and multiple generations may experience pain and repercussions simply because I couldnt handle my own problems long enough to die of natural causes Thats the main reason I personally keep trying to stick around.But as you know other people have other reasons spouse parents pets fear of death etc.If someone has nothing but pain and misery in their lives and they are of sound mind to make an informed decision about death then of course they have the right to end their lives. But if they know itll cause a lot of unnecessary pain to people they love and who love them they may choose to stick around and keep fighting knowing the choice is always there if the pain becomes unbearable.I read somewhere that suicide is like taking all your pain multiplying tenfold and giving it to the people who love you. When you hear suicide survivors talk about their lost loved ones on TV YouTube etc. you can see that many of them are scarred for life some emotionally crippled by their losses. Their inner torture seems almost as unbearable as the torture described by suicidal people themselves. Not to mention that many people alive today are HAPPY theyre still alive after attempting suicide or desperately wishing they were dead. For some not all life does improve. So STAYING ALIVE is clearly the best choice for lots of folks though its often impossible to know whose life will improve and whose wont. That site  has a lot of examples of people who attempted suicide and are grateful to be alive today.,suicidology,d4yh9qd,1,t5_2shhl
8537285,0,t1_d688pvq,I dont know... Whatever I am I still believe in HOPE and in doing whatever I can myself to stay alive  and in encouraging others to do whatever they can to stay alive as well.

8900686,0,t1_d7ho0kd,The antisuicide attitudes in society in general seem like a horrible nightmare. I think its okay to stop someone from killing themselves by force sometimes or refuse to help but there should be a process that everyone can go through to obtain assisted suicide. This includes mentally ill people because their suffering can be no less horrible than physical pain and cannot always be treated satisfactorily. If I contemplate this more it makes this world seem like a hell at least for some people.,suicidology,d7hqgob,1,t5_2shhl
