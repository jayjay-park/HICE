4200997,0,t1_cryzwpb,Well there are a number of factors that influence flavor.  Freshness  How soon after a shower is it? Did she just finish a marathon? There will be more musk the longer you wait after shes cleaned herself.  Diet  Certain foods will impact her flavor and scent as well. Red meats artificial sugars and fatty foods will negatively impact aroma. Whereas fruits will make it a bit sweeter.  Desire  If she is very turned on and you have been teasing her all day she will have a heavier musk scent. Some people find this more desirable than a sweaty musk but some are very similar. There are other influences such as PH levels that I am in no way qualified to discuss as I dont posess a vulva nor a vagina. But I am sure a woman will chime in. ,teachmeNSFW,crz3ue7,2,t5_38e57
