4815770,0,t3_3gpju4,One thing thats interesting to note is the romanization they use. They call it Takemicaduchi Now Japanese traditionally has no du character so this got me intrigued. Looking into it its because the name of the God the tank is named after is spelled not  as wed expect but  with the strange  character. The pronunciation of this character is almost the same as  which is pronounced zu  is pronounced dzu and is relatively uncommon. However if you try typing dzu in an IME it likely wont give you that character that character is achieved by typing du This is why we see du in their romanization of the Takemikazuchis name.,SoraNoWoto,cu1kfc6,2,t5_30551
