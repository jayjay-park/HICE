5390749,0,t1_cw0pi2e,Its because flat penetration early is kind of good. The ability to deal true damage to a squishy is desirable to remove them quickly.However as soon as any one of them get a single nullmagic mantle you are in the same situation as before except that youve just spent  gold on not the most important item for your final build.,MalzaharMains,cw0q8u4,1,t5_38tna

5891773,0,t1_cxrvs0v,Yeah I kinda see that now Ill stick to making them more like the blatantly overexaggerated statements like in the first video.Thanks for the feedback man! Its really great to know that people are into what we are making and its definitely gotten us motivated to make a bunch more!,MalzaharMains,cxry1yt,2,t5_38tna
5893029,0,t1_cxra8fm,Though I suggest adding annotations to the abilities video. I only say this due to the patch on  making the ratio max out at  and the scaling to be a little different.,MalzaharMains,cxs3z53,2,t5_38tna

6313849,0,t3_423gzf,Statikk wrote on  UTC MidYear Mage UpdategtHey all  gt  gtThe next class update will be focused on traditional Mages and Im here to give you guys and gals some of the initial details. Similar to the Juggernaut and Marksman releases these updates aim to take look at an entire class of champions and accomplish  primary goals  gt  gt. Ensure the class as a whole is relevant and satisfying to play  gt. Differentiate each champion within the class  gt  gtWhy Mages?  gtMany Mages are intended to lack mobility but have not necessarily been given clear answers as to what they should do about it or why they work without it. For each subclass of Mages this is something well dive into more in a different post these answers will vary but our intent is to make it clear that each of these champions is powerful in their own unique way.  gt  gtOn the flip side of the coin many of them no longer meet our evolving gameplay standards of interactivity depth uniqueness etc. This is also an opportunity to go back and adjust these champions especially some of our older ones making them more interesting to play as with and against.  gt   gtWho are we working on?  gtSimilar to the Marksman update were aiming to release  significant updates. The champions we are currently considering but are still subject to change are Malzahar VelKoz Brand Vladimir Cassiopeia and Zyra.  gt  gtFor each of these champions we aim for them to be  things  gt  gt. Distinct  offer a unique reason to be picked  gt. Cohesive  deliver on their core thematic and gameplay fantasy  gt.  Healthy  balanceable and fun to play as and against at all skill levels  gt  gtNote that given the scope of these projects we wont necessarily solve every issue on every champion  and fortunately we wont have to since all of the champions already succeed in their own way at some of the above.  gt  gtOn top of the  we are again looking to do a sweep across the entire class as we did with the Marksman to find potential tweaks that will make them more unique interactive and exciting to play. The smallerscale changes done to Twitch and Lucian are good examples of this.  gt  gtWhat can you expect? When?  gtWeve learned a lot from our previous projects and better understand the line between something unique and something unfamiliar. Our priority is to find ways to evolve and enhance the current direction of a champion while still accomplishing the abovestated goals.  gt  gtIn some ways the feeling of change is unavoidable we are updating these champions so things WILL be different. Were confident that we can retain the things you guys love while adding new dimensions.   gt  gtThis is all still a far ways off so dont expect anything soon. As you can infer from the title were aiming to release these changes around midyear and weve only just begun to delve deeply into these projects.  gt  gtHow can you help?  gtWed love to have your guys feedback and opinion on the Mages before and during their development process rather than only at the tail end  especially for the big  Malzahar VelKoz Brand Vladimir Cassiopeia Zyra.  gt  gtWe are most interested in the following about your favorite champion  gt  gt. What aspect is most core or sacred to their identity?   gt. What issue bothers you the most when playing them?  gt  gtThis doesnt mean well be magically giving everyone dashes or any other instant remedies to all their problems weaknesses often exist for a good reason. Instead this information will help us understand which direction to take each champion and where the opportunities lie.   gt  gtWe wont be talking in the shortterm about exact changelists since were still in such a state of flux but we hope you guys are as excited as we are about the updates ahead!

7356848,0,t1_d2dl228,I like ad runes on ap malz but I feel it only majorly helps out early. Hybrid pen runes I feel have a larger effect that impacts his entire game.,MalzaharMains,d2ef8ze,1,t5_38tna
7378160,0,t3_4gbrjs,I have problems with new malzs kit but overall I think its an improvement if they would fix his AP scalings.  His E doesnt deal significant damage as of now and his Ult needs an actual ratio because it literally just does the damage off of his old W. New voidling are cool but they dont scale with armor and mr if they did then they wouldnt get cleared by aoe andor  shot by adcs. ,MalzaharMains,d2gug0v,1,t5_38tna
7383039,0,t1_d2fa9js,If a champ like jax or morde cant even make the current gunblade work as first item i am sorry but i don t think its gonna work on malzahar. ,MalzaharMains,d2hegqi,1,t5_38tna
7453821,0,t1_d2pedhi,Yup that is my main argument. Without ult you are basicly fucked in a v. Silence him early and loose damage silence later and risk getting wrecked instantly.,MalzaharMains,d2pgaac,1,t5_38tna
7654767,0,t3_4k42n3,I havent actually been able to play him enough to know how all the skins look but I do hope they change most if not all of the spellshields to match colors schemes.,MalzaharMains,d3cayoy,1,t5_38tna
7655619,0,t3_4k59sy,I think it depends on what you mean for a beginner.We have people who just want a super consistent champion where the difference between the skill floor and skill cap is mostly difficult nuances Morgana Xin Zhao. For many beginners these very easytopickup champions will be enough but has the downfall of making improvement difficult since it requires a lot of mastery of seemingly minor things.We have people who dont mind starting off with a slightly higher skill floor because its very easy to understand when progress is being made Lux Kench Malzahar. Theres a real sense of progression of getting better because skillshots are landing more often damage is being dealt higher overall and skills are being used more ideally. This category is a good suggestion for many beginners even if not all.And then we have champions whose base skill floor requires reliance on a bunch of those nuances just to succeed making it very difficult to successfully pick up Anivia Evelynn Twisted Fate. This is the only category I would be hesitant to recommend to a beginner.Since Malz fits in the second category I feel Malz is still a good recommendation for many beginners even if not all.,MalzaharMains,d3cegdz,7,t5_38tna
8095530,0,t1_d4q0c6b,Yup. Will add this to the OP.,MalzaharMains,d4q0e08,1,t5_38tna

8235392,0,t1_d56wv9v,Same with Deaths dance and Gunblade which are on physical damage.,MalzaharMains,d56z9ov,1,t5_38tna
8409334,0,t3_4uszeq,Nah its OK depends on everyones positioning your ulti is a great peel for your adc more if the support is engaging type and is in the middle of the fight.I usually stay in the outskirts watching for ideal Qs and when I have a good window w e r whatever I see fitting. Yesterday that served for my adc to kill a fed garen diving him while the rest of our team took care of the others and when the most dangerous abilities were used both of us aced them for a  to . Then we proceeded to take two inhibs and baron when our jungler respawned.,MalzaharMains,d5spmvk,1,t5_38tna
9059249,0,t1_d80qdhv,Fiora and Ekko I find to be really easy matchups with this setup so I expect youll see success there too. Im still too scared to play Malz into Irelia I think Id end up feeding P,MalzaharMains,d80ryet,1,t5_38tna
9526206,0,t1_d9mox10,Actually Rylais slow was better prerework because voidling passive slows the same way it does with current voidlings...  Essentially he lost a skill because they tacked W onto his ult and remove ults base damage in exchange for the passive he currently has.  Like I said earlier W worked like Miss Fortunes E or an Anivia ult once you had Rylais.  The old passive could also save you from Blitzs grabs as long as you keep track of your voidling charges which was similar to keeping track of your stun on Annie.  Of course with the new passive I guess you can just get grabbed and just not care.  In my opinion the only good change they made to Malz is the E resets on Q.  Everything else is worse than prerework.,MalzaharMains,d9nb1bj,1,t5_38tna
9728688,0,t1_dac634h,Haha I love building items like ZzRot or Banner of Command when playing with friends evenespecially as Malzahar. DBut yeh I guess you should only build it when you are already ahead and it doesnt really matter anymore.,MalzaharMains,dac9v22,1,t5_38tna
9747833,0,t3_5eob3m,Like Sheensta said Ghost offers a lot of utility at all stages of the game and allows you to gankroam with ease.Ignite is useful about up until you get Morello at which point Ignite is just extra damage on a long CD.,MalzaharMains,daemsft,1,t5_38tna
9808139,0,t1_dajsdkm,Since Morellomnomnomicon is one of Malzs core items anyway taking Ignite to counter tankssustain fighters is still redundant.,MalzaharMains,dam2ahh,1,t5_38tna
9861181,0,t1_dasv3v3,well the damage is sure significantly apparently lower than normal ap build but the most damage comes from voidling as you have higher ad than in an usual build. the main reason for this build tho is to soak alot of damage with tons of hp and to heal a lot,MalzaharMains,dasxo3i,1,t5_38tna
9907467,0,t1_dayq9oz,Yeah my last few games Ive been trying lost chapter into rylais and then finishing Nom and Ive gotta say as long as Im even or ahead it seems to work. ,MalzaharMains,dayysyj,1,t5_38tna

10626292,0,t3_5s1qbv,It would be really easy if they would just revert the . changes to his voidlings.Unfortunately autotarget spells are always going to be binary. It was easier to balance when his w was a zoning tool and not another form of nighunavoidable dps. Now theyre giving players as many tools as possible to avoid the dps which means Malzahar gets nerfed.Honestly I know its a nono but the best thing to do would be to change his w and passive again to something new. The voidling thing and minibanshees is gimicky and its clear it is too difficult to balance. Those two abilities continue to be the source of nerf after nerf until he has the barebones kit that can do barely anything were familiar with now.Both of those abilities were NOT introduced to make his gameplay more interesting interactive or give him a higher skillceiling. Instead they added to the fantasy of commanding a voidling army as you bring about inevitable destruction to Runeterra and made his kit look different from other mages kits.And they succeeded at those two things so now they are content to nerf him until he has   winrate somewhere. Midlane Malzahar is probably dead and gone tbh.,MalzaharMains,ddc0ri4,16,t5_38tna
10682724,0,t1_ddhu8eg,His support isnt hurt nearly as much imo.Blocking skillshots wasnt even half of what made him a viable mage support.His suppress high ap magic dmg and way higher safety than brand or zyra will always make him a high tier support. Malz mid is definitely more hurt by this since voidlings are basically all of his dmg but not even half of supports utility.,MalzaharMains,ddhubui,3,t5_38tna

11579986,0,t1_dg8kcns, An e  q will proc thunderlords and do a lot of damage on top of silencing who is being poked regardless if a voidling is there or not they add on to the poke quite heavily though. I didnt know a  second long silence wasnt considered cc my bad. Also thats why Malzahar support rushes cdr boots and eye of the watchers to be able to utilize that ult as much as possible. Velkoz and Brand do not outcc malzahar and the range difference isnt really enough to justify them as counters considering all he has to is flash ult one of them to set up a gank perfectly with little to no counterplay in the slightest. Thats also part of the health they dislike unlike velkoz brand and zyra who all of their cc is dodgable Malzahars ultimate has literally zero counterplay unless you rush a qss which while it isnt as big of a problem in midlane something that powerful is HUGE in bottom lane considering his very presence puts an ADC behind just by being level . ,MalzaharMains,dg8ljbx,1,t5_38tna
