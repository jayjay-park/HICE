1647500,0,t1_cjl2boc,I appreciate your response and the information youve given me. As far as question  from the research Ive done I noticed some people said when they attained rank they were put into desk jobs and I was just wondering whether or not it was just because they had been in or if other factors might have been involved. Im hoping to go to Germany at some point during my career because it looks beautiful and Ive heard good things.,securityforces,cjmtxcq,1,t5_2tj88
3510903,0,t3_30h00g,Short answer for now as Im out the door to work NISP Contractor momentarily... Whatever they offer.  The actual SF Officer courses will have you doing the real training. Lots of different opportunities often based on your prefered direction.  Personally I went in the NISP direction where jobs as FSO SM CPSO ISSOM ISP abound. Ill leave this one to one of the K guys Never saw an officer working K in my entire career... even the heads of K shops were SNCOs Politics paperwork and wrangling a herd of bored  year olds.  Luckily if the officer has good SNCOs they can focus on just the politics and paperwork. If you want an SFS slot you can usually easily get one. What officers do varies greatly by rank and position.  Good ones starting out simply learn from their SNCOs.  Eventually at the top level they are the equivalent of a small or sometimes not so small town police chief with all the associated politics and silliness.,securityforces,cpsgtej,1,t5_2tj88
