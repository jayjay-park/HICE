3379779,0,t1_cpdhnl7,You seem to be very concerned about CoD. If youre playing Guile well against a bad Abel he should only get the chance to do it once or twice in a fight  Zone like buggery. The only thing hes got is ex terry kick to get through. lots of st hp which can combo into itself against Abel at mid screen and st mk if he jumps.Im pretty sure CoD is a mix up. You dont get to have answers for everything Id need to check the frame data though. One simple piece of advice would be to build up  meters and keep it just to Flash Kick FADC out of CoD or wake up pressure. A bad Abel will not punish it  frames.Ultra  is great but it has loads of weaknesses. Does it next to you? Charge flash during the animation it armour breaks.  Does it when  you have  bar anywhere else? EX boom.You could test in the training room what ranges HK flash will beat it.Also its not full screen if hes further away than half screen you could simply jump back and theres nothing he can do.U is a punish ultra not much you can do about it save DO NOT JUMP AT ABEL WHEN HE HAS ULTRA. Its an easy cr hp U for him.If hes just using high low block mix ups on wake up mash back dash. Abel has OSes that wreck Guile if hes not using make his life a misery Zone zone zone is the key though!,StreetFighter,cpdiq55,3,t5_2qnu5

3517475,0,t1_cprsin9,The thing about parries in SF is that they require next to no commitment. In footsie situations you can just tap forward or down at opportune times with virtually no risk but a big reward if you actually manage to parry an attack. This is very different from anything SF has. Focus is the closest thing but even that requires you to commit to the focus charge and release the attack or dash. There is a risk in both of these options and that makes it very different from a guess parry.Im not saying that S is a bad game or that parry is a bad mechanic although I feel there are better ways to implement it than what they did here Im just saying that parries really do cause some issues that make SF a very different game in comparison to the other SF titles.,StreetFighter,cpt7v9v,2,t5_2qnu5

I dont like how he is struggling with the Satsui no Hado if only because he seems so resolute at other times. Also giving Sagat his scar makes me like him less. As for game play I think hes annoying. Hes just so well rounded. He can play SF however he damn well pleases. Like you want fireballs hes got em. You want ambiguous mixups hes got em. You want some footsies hes got em. A Ryu with Ultra W is so dangerous. His overhead is slow but at least he has one. With other characters i can say things like At least I dont have to worry about X but not with him.

Or does that make the people using him so well toptier?When Evil Ryu is rated toptier I get it. Devastating combos and the like and alot of people use him accordingly.Tier is a subjective term it loosely means preferential and thats why the answers are so varied and alwaysddebatable.Like I get where Nemo is coming from but I agree with you.

4403955,0,t3_3bgig8,Here is a glossary of terms. EX Focus  By using two bars of super meter you can cancel out of certain moves. Used in combos and to end move animations quicker to make them safer. Frame Trapping  Purposefully leaving gaps in your combo if you think the opponent is trying to press buttons to get out of it. For example if theyre blocking your hits and you think theyre trying to mash out a shoryuken to get you off of them you leave a gap in your combo to let their shoryu come out but you block it and punish accordingly.Tick Throw  Following up blocked normals with a throw to surprise the opponent. This is sort of the opposite function of frame traps. Use it on opponents that are blocking way too much. ,StreetFighter,csm26w5,2,t5_2qnu5

4596813,0,t3_3dwtyn,Because that top  was just pure art.  Momochi overcomes the raw skill and knowledge that is Infiltration sending him to losers.  Gamerbee on his last legs having fought valiantly against gods and champions faces his most mentally draining battle yet.  After what seemed like hours the set finally ended and Gamerbee had won. A previous EVO champ goes home.  And all that remained were two warriors who had fought hard to get where they were. They both deserved to win. But only one could.  What follows are some of the most tense games Ive seen in a while but Gamerbee does it. He resets the bracket and is ready for a comeback.  They are neck and neck  only one game left.  Momochi takes a round. But then...  The disconnect...  After some confusion and lots of waiting Bee is given the round and in the words of the SFIV announcer It all comes down to this.  Thousands of dollars a gold TE the crystal trophy and the right to call yourself the EVO Ultra Street Fighter IV champion came down to a single round.  My heart was pounding just watching.

4870681,0,t1_cu8cia2,Heh I just meant that I hoped you dont need me to tell me why you want to play your character. Strategy and matchups is a whole other thing though.Well EX Shunpukyaku is  on block so using that to punish from stand LK is safe unless they mash after blocking the stand LK as it wont be a true blockstring. But if youre that worried about getting punished practise the punish. Most characters dont have anything to punish LP Criminal Upper most of the time so the fact Sakura has a relatively easy punish into her main combo starter or a knockdown is awesome. You really play down the knockdown from HP Shouken thats a really powerful position for Sakura to be inWell yeah you cant always expect to get a fully optimised max damage combo as a punish you can at least get cr.HPxxLKTatsu st.LKxxHP Shouken for like  damage meterless. Or you can just go straight into EX Tatsu for reset or hard knockdown shenanigans.If hes just throwing out ruffian kicks the best answer is walk up block and punish. Sure the best you might be able to get is cr.MKxxShouken but thats ish damage and a really sweet knockdowns are great knockdown. Even if you dont get any oki off that if he does that  times you win.Yeah you cant really use traditional buffers with Sakuras cr.MK into Shouken as youll get wrecked on block. It is possible to hit confirm it you do cr.MK and the shoryuken motion but then only hit HP when you see them get hit and not block. Its not easy though some Sakura players will just wait till they have  meters and buffer it normally and just FADC it if shit goes wrong. Youre  on FADC forwards on HP and EX Shouken btw so its not super legit to try and pressure afterwards. Do whatever works best for you its a really powerful tool to be able to do one hit confirms like that.,StreetFighter,cu8hj0n,1,t5_2qnu5

5066206,0,t3_3ke1wp,Command Grab  An unblockable grab special a classic example is Zangiefs Spinning Pile Driver and youll hear people call most command grabs SPDs. Command grabs differ from throws in that they cannot be techedthrow escaped. Other good terms to knowOption Select  An exploitation of the game engine that allows for multiple different outcomes with the result being whichever is the best option. FADC  Stands for Focus Attack Dash Cancel. Pretty much using a focus attack and cancelling it into a dash. Reset  Purposefully dropping a combo in the hope of being able to start another one. Due to damage scaling in which combos do less damage with more hits its better to do two small combos than one long combo. Oki  Short for okizeme.

You have to realize that in matchups that are fireball heavy players pick U just because EX instant air jaguar is still too good that it makes U actually redundant.Also pressing buttons after Jaguars arent necessarily terrible. You just have to know situations. Youre getting CHd off Jaguars when you could have easily just stand back tech to throw Sagats slow normals and OS block in case of reversal DP. You need to maximize your buttons to cover more options.Youre also gonna have to realize that a lot of this game is about not having matchup knowledge at face value but looking even deeper and asking What do I do if he shows that he knows? You should always be adjusting and looking on how to adjust with your toolset.Also just get more experience and comfortability playing offline. Your execution was pretty crappy probably due to nerves. It happens when youre on that SF adrenaline high. Like theres videos of me out there where I lost to some pretty high level players because I reacted too fast for a super punish due to the insane amount of focus at that moment and didnt get a reversal because the input was too early.

5195684,0,t3_3m49xa,My advice is to play with lots of different characters. You will quickly learn which moves YOU throw out that get punished then you will remember which moves they were when it comes to play against those characters. Ive played for a few years and Im of an okay standard but there are some characters Ive barely played and I still dont know which all of their moves which are punishable  and by whom.Another good piece of advice is to throw out a fast move like a light jab or a shoryuken against pretty much any attack they throw out. If it seems to hit often youve probably found a punishable attack. A lot of players spend most of their street fighter careers just mashing light jabkick while their opponent is trying to combo so they can hopefully get in there when their opponent makes a mistake.,StreetFighter,cvc9vdz,2,t5_2qnu5

But I mean why do you not expect to lose to that? If it worked on you then that gives you something to work on. in the moment of losing it really sucks and like someone else said losing isnt fun for anyone. I think you should just try to push past the feeling of loss. Try and get out of your own head dont think about it or even try to meditatedistract yourself from the loss by listening to music or something. I mean im sure youve seen pro players at tournaments. Their expressions are generally super neutral and yet they must be really feel pressure before and during tournaments. So theres gotta be a way to adapt right?

5489946,0,t3_3q9gx4,I spent about  hours trying to make Necalli work.After getting bodied like I had never been in a fighting game before after  hours I decided to just sitback and play Necalli not like a brawler that I thought hed be but like a shittyHonda. That seemed to work very well and I started going major winning streaks with him.My brother during the PC phase of the beta told me I needed to check out Claw ASAP!I had tried him with the PS but he felt superstiff to me.Anyway since I was no longer going to be stuck playing with a DS for the PC beta I decided to give Claw a whirl again. It was then I that I learned  things The DS is the worst controller for fighting games in the history of game controllers. Id rather play on a gen Xbox  controller than super stiff as fuck fuck DSs Dpad. Noclaw Vega is a better Necalli than Necalli.Once every character showed up I tried them all. Without a doubt the worst characters of the  available were Nash and Necalli IMHO.Nash more due to his nerfs. Where in Beta  I was getting blown up by teleport setups and shenanigans in Beta  with his teleport speed nerf and shortened combos I owned almost every Nash I faced. In one match I wish the replay system worked so I could show this a Nash play did a MK slice kick that I blocked teleport cancel behind me into a neutral jump MK. However the teleport was either too slow or something because since I knew it was coming I held forward on the stick after the MK slice kick and was able to walk out of range on the falling behind Nj.MK walk in and command grab him.,StreetFighter,cwde3tw,3,t5_2qnu5

Of course they release a character every  months so that people keep playing the game they are hyped and CAPCOM doesnt risk to break the game by releasing  characters. But in my modest opinion releasing  characters would be possible without breaking the game. Still as I said you can make a character avaible for ranked matches just when you are sure he is not broken.Im not saying CAPCOM should act like this because it is better. But as player I would love something like that because I enjoy trying out and fightning against many characters not  at day  but  every month.,StreetFighter,cwjr2kl,0,t5_2qnu5

If you block a step kick and you think hes going to throw you can backdash neutral jump or reversal. He can beat your jump or backdash with fierce though and if he thinks youre going to reversal he can just not dash after the step kick.

5844871,0,t1_cxkscrb,Right naturally youll be limited by meter restrictions. But I predict the SFV metagame will revolve around managing your VGauge and this technique will serve to cement that. SFV incentivizes offense Crush Counters build extra VGauge so players are encouraged to use counter hit set ups. Punishing a baited reversal awards extra VGauge so players are encouraged to pressure their opponents. You can even put yourself ahead in the race to fill your VGauge by pressuring your opponent into using a VReversal. If you can build a VTrigger before your opponent youre in a very commanding position. Now you can sit back and safely fish for a VTrigger activation by buffering it into your pokes. ,StreetFighter,cxlsfom,1,t5_2qnu5

When people thought when pro fighting game tourneys would go mainstream was that the underground crowdbuilt nature of the FGC would be lost. They acted like the FGC was this hardcore  Mile shit and that would be lost if the racial and sexual epithets were toned down.So what if a bunch of YouTube personalities latch onto SF?

Cross ups while not as easy to set up as in SF are really easy to do and do a lot in this game that I got quite a bit of mileage comboing out of them. His buttons as pokes arent quite spectacular but cr. MK and sweep still serve their age old purposes. His combo damage is a little bit on the low side upon first inspection but there are some uses of meter and some decent combos to use to remedy this.

If I can read when she will throw it out ex rbg works as well.Generally with Laura she is one of the characters I allow to back themselves up others I chase down once she is reduced to keeping you out with fireballs you should be within range for a sweep which will most likely exchange or st.hp. lariat is also great to use in these situations as well.Hope the info helps!,StreetFighter,cy4o722,1,t5_2qnu5

6002490,0,t1_cy6f0su,gt Nash can do  pretty easily with  barsThat depends on what you mean by pretty easily. Jumpin combos arent worth considering when weighing damage output because its very unlikely youll land a clean jumpin against a decent opponent. Nash can easily break  damage from normal frame traps but he cant hit  without crush counter VTrigger or both. For example one of his beefiest nonCC counterhit combos is CH cr.HPgtst.HP xx HK Sonic Scythe. That does  damage and if you burn a bar on EX Sonic Scythe you bump it up to  damage. His crush counter combos are certainly damaging though and even more so with VTrigger. CC st.HP xx EX Moonsault Slashgtst.MP xx HK Sonic Scythe does  damage and  stun. Throw another bar and a VTrigger cancel in there and Nash can do  damage and  stun with CC st.HP xx EX Moonsault Slashgtst.MP xx HK Sonic Scythe xx f.VTC j.HK EX Sonic Scythe. ,StreetFighter,cy6gg1q,1,t5_2qnu5

Like Marth in Smash Hakan relies on spacing and real good fundamentals to shine through and originally from what Ive read people say this game is really balanced yet when Hakan is mentioned a tier list suddenly exists? Idk man. He has tons of cool shit like a sliding focus attack dash canceled normals cool specials etc.He just makes sense to me.

Its an incredibly refreshing take on the series and I love what theyve done.Lowering the execution barrier means that I can actually teach people more about footsies than telling them to grind out optimal combos and whatnot. I love it.Its all about reads and reactions spacing and options. Not about dropping  frame links.If I had one gripe about SFV itd be the abundance of option selects that currently exist but who knows if theyll make it into the final version of the game.,StreetFighter,cyaxg3e,5,t5_2qnu5

If they truly have big plans for the single player maybe a lot of the missing pieces are being held back to prevent spoilers.

6101308,0,t3_3z4ccb,Okay so first thing first you should post questions in the Daily General Thread That is the page you get when you click Submit a Question if the thread isnt on the frontpage then check there. Its filled with a bunch of resources to help you get better at the game. As soon as you realise you have a hole in your game ask how to fill it in there if it isnt answered by any of the linked resources.Second thing here are a bunch more links from uledford that he usually gives peopleHere are four links that I often provide to new players. They have everything you need to go from being completely new to being a seasoned veteran. Any questions you have will be answered if you search through these links. Fighting Game PrimerThis first link is a rather lengthy .pdf manual that helps bring you from A to Z when it comes to playing fighting games  specifically Street Fighter  and covers everything. Articles on Concepts and FundamentalsThis second link covers many metagame concepts and fundamental mechanics of Street Fighter. I highly recommend the Footsies Handbook as well as the Footsies video but all the other links are excellent as well. Improving Your Training EfficiencyThis third link contains articles that will help you learn faster and overall improve faster in training mode. Very critical for progressing meaningfully as a new player! Losing To Yourself by Joe MundayThis fourth link by JoeMunday helps explain the mental breakdown that happens when you experience an bitter loss. Its hard to learn from losses if you cant handle them very well. Its a great read to understand the mental aspects of Street Fighter.There is also a group called SF Chat that is dedicated to creating a hub for players in the groups chat so you dont have to add every player you come across just to talk to them! Feel free to join and ask any questions you have. You can also add me on Steam mouse over the icon next to my name at the top of this post and ask me any questions you have as well Im always happy to help new players!Good luck!PS  I forgot to mention this dudes YouTube channel is a great resource!  uledford master of new player linksThird thing... you cant learn much in six weeks if you havent played Fighting games seriously before. Its fine learning slowly you dont need to start trying to compete as soon as SFV drops ease yourself into it. If you dont you might just risk burning yourself out ever frustrated by the losses you face these losses dont need to be frustrating you just need to understand that you have a lot of learning to do and many players will be far far better than you. This is normal. Just have fun with the game and try to learn from it.,StreetFighter,cyj5ngd,18,t5_2qnu5

6107764,0,t1_cyjn63e,This is a really good breakdown. You are absolutely right about no chip kills being illogical and whats worse is the fact that CAs can still kill via chip. I was really confused the first time that happened to me. Its also a great point to make that while killing with chip doesnt really seem like earning a victory the victory was earned previously by setting up the situation where one player has such an advantage.That being said Im sure Capcom is aware of this. This change helps make the game more exciting which is important to them since the biggest complaint against  was that it was too slowboring. Not having chip kills keeps the game exciting down to the last second which is an upside in its own right. I think both sides of the argument have valid points to make.,StreetFighter,cyjw2ah,2,t5_2qnu5

6113080,0,t1_cyjxfi5,Im sure the idea is to discourage people from spamming overheads.  The thing with Street Fighter is that overheads tend to work A LOT since crouching block is pretty much the default way to block  of grounded normals in the game.  I can understand increasing the risks of using an almost guaranteed move.In D fighters low attackssweeps have the same almost guaranteed properties as a D overhead since standing block is the default defensive option in those games.  And as a result the game is balanced such that low attacks tend to be very highrisk highly punishable and convert to less damage than midhigh attacks.,StreetFighter,cykhszw,2,t5_2qnu5
6114268,0,t1_cyk0hm7,Why do people downvote you? Im also excited to see how much FGC can grow as Capcom focusing more on online play. FGC is fairly small comparing to other genres in general.

Most players are relatively used to their speeds anyway without explicit training making it easier to time them for wakeups.

6174756,0,t3_404kwo,Most damaging VT combo that I found without using EX was st.mp cr.hp xx VT st.hk st.lk xx h shoryu.  Up to this point Ive really only seen cr.hp xx VT cr.hp xx h shoryu as a max VT punish.  The st.hk moves you forward far enough to let you get a st.mp before your first cr.hp and st.lk can link after st.hk then cancel into h shoryu no issues with whiffing at all.  Obviously you can continue the cancel into CA for more damage.While were on the subject of Ryu BNB Ill throw my basic findings in hereNormals you can link off of from least frame advantage on hit to greatest  st.hkbhk fhp st.mpst.hkbhk  links into light no medium or heavy.fhp  links into medium and light no heavy.st.mp  links into medium and light as well as cr.hp but otherwise no heavy attacks though it can be cancelled into st.hp as his target combo.Tatsumaki will whiff on crouching.  Cr.hp forces stand.  If you can hit cr.hp your shoryuken will always connect.  Shoryuken can be cancelled into CA but you can also link CA off of a light tatsu.Chain attacks can be cancelled.  You cannot cancel out of cr.lk.  St.lk is best ender for chain combos due to range if you want to go for three hits most other lights will whiff as third hit besides st.lk.  You can cancel out of st.lk with h or EX shoryu any hadoken or L M or EX tatsu not H.Basic BNB combos w st.mp st.mp xx st.hp xx st.hk target combo  easiest BNB punish  damage st.mp st.mp xx st.hp xx st.hk st.mp st.mp xx special st.mp cr.mp xx special st.mp cr.mk xx special st.mp st.lk xx special st.mp cr.hp xx special  most reliable BNB punish  damage w h shoryu enderBasic BNB combos w st.hk st.hk st.lk xx specialBasic BNB combos w bhk bhk st.lk xx specialBasic BNB combos w fhp fhp st.mp cr.mk xx special  most damaging BNB punish  damage w h tatsu ender against standing  damage w hado ender against crouching  damage w ex tatsu ender against crouching fhp cr.mp xx special fhp cr.mk xx special fhp st.lk xx special fhp xx h shoryu second hit of fhp is special cancellableObviously these damage values are all subject to change I just wanted to throw some numbers up for certain ones to give people a point of reference.,StreetFighter,cyri8b6,4,t5_2qnu5

The game does not have a specific DLC screen like for instance SSB FANG goes in one of the spaces as well as if he was added above Mika where there is no slot that would off balance the screen and the missing space to the left would be stupid. But if this is fakeI think it is that means FANG will go above Mika to balance it like he should and then the dlc would be added in balance left right left etc. not leaving any weird spaces. ,StreetFighter,cz5gbc4,1,t5_2qnu5

Keep doing this until you feel your opponent has figured out that wakeup DP is a bad idea and then start doing stuff on their wakeup again until you think theyll try another DP.This wont work on everyone especially online and around the pp level since theres plenty of people who will absolutely never learn no matter how many times you punish them for something but figuring out these kind of mindgames is important anyway,StreetFighter,czcujsh,2,t5_2qnu5

6424592,0,t1_czjpm7p,we talked about this a little on steam earlier but i think a lot of the jabbiness of the game right now is due to an incomplete understanding on our part of frame data.  necalli players mashed stand jab vs me constantly because my frame traps gap was too wide.  it was super fucking annoying so i checked nashs frame data and found a frame trap that catches it.  st.lk cr.MP and then if i get a counterhit i can go to st.mp.  the normal cr.mp st.mp frame traps gap is too wide so certain characters will be able to mash out of it.this was a thing in  too but the buffer has made bad frame traps very easy to exploit.  if you leave a gap thats too wide any idiot can blow you up for it now.  the result is a game that feels almost turnbased... maybe thats good and maybe its bad i dont know but thats how it is now.  i think an actual objective problem though is how no one can really trap at any range beyond like... sfsakuraframe trap range.  in general everyone is awesome at close ranges and doesnt really have much outside of that. so at that point jab is just going to beat a lot of your stuff.  ,StreetFighter,czju8pv,10,t5_2qnu5

Why do you think that audience knows about Smash and MK?  They connect with the characters in those games because of the lore.  I enjoy Street Fighter and am really looking forward to V but I dont really connect with a single character in the game like I do with characters in Smash and MK.  I dont know a single thing about Ryu or Ken but I know about the rivalry between SubZero and Scorpion.  The amount of connection I have with Smash characters is crazy.  That is what makes kids want to play those games.  Forget kids its what makes me want to play those games.I am drawn to street fighter purely because of the game play.  That is not going to be the case for the younger audience.  My enjoyment of Street Fighter would increase significantly if I had the same connection to the characters that I have in those other franchises.

He has to rely on his parry to deflect and punish his enemies abusing their longer range pokes.  His dash forward is great to take advantage of the hesitation his fireball and parry game creates so if someones not actively pressing buttons and controlling space you can dash forward into a throwstrike which tempts them into whiffing buttons to prevent that from happening which starts opening up your whiff punish game.SFV is a lot less linear than older SF games so thats why I try to stray from suggesting a single basic option to rely upon because you just cant do that anymore.,StreetFighter,czq78y7,1,t5_2qnu5

Not to mention the face buttons are perfect for everything except EX moves.I decided to switch to fightpad because I was having trouble using my index fingers to reliably hit both analog shoulder buttons for VTrigger activation.  That issue completely goes away with the FC and the MCZ pads since you can just push RR with your thumb.I feel like the Hori FC is more similar to the DS  the MCZs circular dpad and harder to press face buttons are just too different for a quick transition.  However the Hori FC seems like it was made with more of an old school thumbsplayer in mind.,StreetFighter,cztmjz6,2,t5_2qnu5

For example your version did look better but there were still a bunch of flaws.Drawing is really hard. It can get very tedious and just drag on but you have to finish it and cant afford to stop because of your deadline. Other times you can just sometimes slip up and make mistakes and not think to go back and fix them until youve already started liningcoloring it.

6566949,0,t1_czyk59d,gt Inside the manga sketchy view they are very proportional without the head. They usually are overproportional on chubby or curvy woman. But this is in other league. Imagine the rest of the paint and try to imagine it walking or something its awful.im not sure i totally know what you mean by the first sentence im sorry.  i think what you are saying is that this is extreme for a manga sketchy style?  in which case i would have to seriously disagree  this is pretty vanilla and very mainstream as far as fucked up body proportions in manga go.  it is very different from the style that they use to actually render the characters though is that what youre talking about?  because i totally understand disliking the contrast between the two.and actually the sense of motion is the reason i prefer the original over this redraw.  the redraw looks incredibly stiff and puppetlike and the original almost looks like she is in the middle of dancing or something.  well to me at least.  but i also read and enjoy a lot of manga that does not look incredibly dissimilar.  gt Also the quality of the draw is poor as fuck. For example you can have a flat belly like this but you dont have just  straight lines making the belly part. Thats just shameful.well first off less lines does not equal less quality at all especially to JP artists.  the fewer lines you can use to convey something the better.  so this just looks like intentional and wellexecuted minimalism to me.  and those are such radically different styles you compared right now though that idk what to say.  i cant even really compare them myself but i can say the FMA pic does not scream manga to me at all the way the Laura illustration does. anyways its interesting that people are so polarized by this to me.  i never would have picked it for something thatd be controversial as i was playing the game myself thats for sure.  ,StreetFighter,czyks3h,1,t5_2qnu5

6612169,0,t3_467ki7,Hitconfirms off one hit is possible but if youre asking this question then your issue is with hitconfirms in general. In which case best tip really that helps my friends is to go through with your string as if its going to hit. Recognize in your string when that point of no return is read point where your opponent will guarantee punish you regardless of your followup and make the recognition of whether your buttons are hitting or being blocked prior to that point.Example If you played a character who had st.MPgtcr.MPgtcr.MPgtDP as a basic combo I would do st.MPgtcr.MP and at this point I Would check if its hit or block. If its hit then you can continue as normal and finish the combo. If its on block then you have various options here you could stop at cr.MP you could do the second cr.MP to push the opponent back farther and stop afterwards. You could do a fireball if the character had one after the first cr.MP. You could do fireball after the second cr.MP. You could do a different normal after the second cr.MP to do a spaced frame trap etc.In these situations though I press the initial st.MP and cr.MP with the intention and mindset that theyre going to hit and then diverge when I recognize its being blocked. The idea is that its easier to recognize and stop something than it is to recognize and start something. So if you go with the intention of doing the combo you can quickly stop when you see that its being blocked instead of doing a string with the intention of it being blocked and then attempting to make the quick adjustment that your opponent is getting hit.,StreetFighter,d0395w8,2,t5_2qnu5

Ive always had good luck with Hori products and the FC is no different I suggest checking your local Gamestop stores as the clearance price seems to be a universal drop on the controller and last time I checked Amazon was sold out and thirdparties were selling it for .

6627496,0,t3_46fqko,I fully agree but a lot of people on this reddit are generally incapable of understanding your point. They are suffering from an extreme case of amnesia in that no one seems to remember that Capcom fed us the catering to new players crap for a year straight and then released the worst SF I can imagine for a casual to buy...Like you said  the single player contentor lack of no decent tutorial for example will put off so many launch day casuals that I cant see why people on here are just shrugging their shoulders and going whatever  launch always sucks. Its a real shame that Capcom dropped the ball this bad considering how good the game play is. All they had to do was wait until March or just prioritise for launch properly. They have DLC chars already finished but dont have a working trials or a decent tutorial system? Come on guys wake up! Theyre basically doing a semi SFXT on us and for some reason everyone is just accepting it this time around? Its quite amazing what excitement for a new SF does to people. Btw as a long time SF player  years now this launch has completely killed my hype for SFV. Ive had about  matches in  days. Ive had offline lag for crying out loud for about  straight games of survival. Survival is implemented terribly. Story mode is practically insulting. Theres no trials. No CPU vs mode. No ONLINE REMATCH Wtf? Is SFV the end of ranked run backs?. No way to message on CFN shocking ... and the list goes on. Its safe to say Im disappointed after waiting so damn long for the game. Capcom need to know that these shady business practices will kill the genre before they help it. I literally dont even feel the desire to fire up the game again today.Tldr these things on launch are more important to drawing in newer players than the tiny little game play specifics like no kara and yet Capcom completely ed up this aspect of it. When you have  of official reviews telling new players to wait until March or Summer you have to realise that you have now lost a significant amount of potential buyers who would have had their impulses triggered by the launch hype. Sigh.EDIT And please lets not forget weve had  BETA TESTS not including the mini ones!  ffs!!! No online multiplayer game Ive played in my entire life has had that many beta tests and launched with pretty much an unplayable online lol. But I could easily overlook all the server launch issues if the REST OF THE GAME was finished. Maybe Im just from the old school era and got used to games being released with the mark of pride all over them rather than the scars of corporate blindness.,StreetFighter,d04u9al,54,t5_2qnu5

6629865,0,t3_46h9c9,Im not sure if it was rd Strike specifically or Street Fighter  in general... But there are a couple of reasons.. The cast alienated many old fans. At the time people didnt want a big cast of characters they didnt know  they wanted all the characters they grew up with.. Despite the Parry being loads of fun  and a clever and fundamental mechanic... It also served as a wall between skill levels. People who could consistently parry opening hits annihilated those who couldnt. It also made it a lot trickier to balance characters.I still think Third Strike is the most fun Street Fighter.. but its also very unbalanced and is not the most accessible fighter out there.,StreetFighter,d0532n3,27,t5_2qnu5

6636191,0,t3_46jzp4,This was my approach to learning Gen back in SFIVFocus on one specific thing at a time. For example cr.mk gt hadoken. Grind it out in training until you never miss it from both sides then play a casual match and make a conscious effort to get into a situation where that move is useful. Disregard winninglosing just focus on performing the move. Once youve successfully done that a few times it will become easier to do it on instinct.Once youve reached the point where that particular thing comes on its own during a match  which might take a significant amount of matches  start learning the next thing. Maybe antiairing for example. Rinse and repeat focus on one thing grind it in training and then focus on performing it in a match until you start doing them by routine.Eventually youll have learned enough techniques to cover the most common situations youll find yourself in and youll be able to perform them on reaction without conscious effort. At that point youll start consistently winning until you hit the next skill plateu.Good luck!,StreetFighter,d05qlzy,2,t5_2qnu5

With Cammy learn cr.LKgtst.LP x HK Spiral Arrow. If cr.LK hits continue with the combo. If cr.LK is blocked stop at st.LP. Since st.LP is  on block you can go for a frame trapgrab mixup.. Learn your good footsie buttons. Know what buttons are good for throwing out there. With Cammy this means using st.MK and cr.MK for footsies and knowing their ranges.That should keep you busy for a while.

Neutral jump to avoid fireballs. Move into medium distance. Wait for fireball. Jump over and do heavy kick into sweep or any other big damage move you want.

I used to play Oni in ultra so it took a bit of time for me to get used to not doing SRK motions as counters and such. With a bit of practice on spacing and learning your normals because of all the variations on his mediums and heavies hes a solid character and all ranges. The most difficult thing about Nash is that he has no invincibility on any of his moves making them risky if not used wisely.

There are many times where I block think Im ok and Ill start mashing but it only leaves me open to getting countered. Learn to block and see which attacks are left open to getting in a jab LP. Or dash away to get some space. Once youre more familiar with your characters faster attacks you can learn to counter and punish when the enemy is open. Block and stay blocking. If you block enough you can reset and then its up to you to decide how to proceed. You can either go aggressive or stay defensive and wait to counter whatever your opponent does.,StreetFighter,d0elice,1,t5_2qnu5

6728623,0,t1_d0f0f1i,IMO after you block the ressenha you should press your fastest button to punish.It is  at best HP ressenha and  at worst LP ressenha. So after you block the two hits you should really just punish it straight up instead of waiting for the slide or jump grab.Another addition is that Karins shoulder is  on block so after she uses that her turn is over. You need to start pressing buttons after that and not let Karin roll over you.,StreetFighter,d0far3t,1,t5_2qnu5

6746055,0,t1_d0h0o8v,Go into training mode and set the dummy to do a f jab on wakeup. Set recovery to random so they do quick rise and back rise too and try to time a button so you get a counter. You can also set up wakeup throw too if you want its just that throws are  frame so its a larger window. If you can do a meaty and beat a jab youll beat a throw.Personally I like st.MP since I can always do something like st.MP cr. MK xx Fireball which will still get some chip and pushback if they block. Im no expert though so youre probably better off exploring your options for what to use as a meaty attack. If theyre always blocking your meaty start using throw. If theyre DPing start shimmyblocking. You can mix in jump attacks crossups empty jumps etc in as well. The only safe options like fireball from a distance are also ones that wont really get you anything. You have the upper hand after a knockdown its worth trying to baitpunish something using that advantage.,StreetFighter,d0h3kf6,3,t5_2qnu5

On block people will typically punish with two jabs and not a full combo.Mikas only invincible option is EX airplane but its only invincible after a few startup frames.  Its a solid wake up option after knockdown that are out of range from close range meaty attacks.Aside from the gimmicks Mika has to take the blockstring.   Be wary of your opponents normal ranges.

6752856,0,t3_488sbi,FYI a Fightstick is a Madcatz brand and Arcade Stick is the general thing itself. Some people get their feathers a little ruffled if you confuse the two. I use the keyboard myself its basically a hitbox. I think the majority of this community probably use the ps controller or xbone controller with the next most common being an arcade stick. Simply because arcade sticks are expensive and a good number of pro players have shown that pads are just as good as sticks. Its worth pointing out that a lot of beginners assume that if they bought an arcade stick they would improve and that is what is holding them back.In reality its just the game. You just need to practice and have matches and improve. If you didnt play in the arcades as a kid using an arcade stick will be really awkward for a while so youll probably be even worse on stick than on your current setup and that can certainly be frustrating. A lot of people like Horis Fight Commander  and  which are cheaper pads with all the buttons on the face of the controller and the build quality is pretty good. Id recommend just sticking with whatever you are using now for a while until you are good at the game and have the money to spend on some high quality hardware regardless of what method you prefer. ,StreetFighter,d0hswfn,2,t5_2qnu5

This is especially true since its early in the games life and people are still feeling out the options of different characters.    As the game matures there arent as many meaningful opportunities to talk about these things since it becomes something of a tired topic to talk about.  If a player shows off some kind of newobscure tech for their character using the frame data to think and communicate about how it works then becomes important.  ,StreetFighter,d0i4hl1,2,t5_2qnu5

Beyond this when playing Dhalsim in any game you really have to understand what the opponent wants to do.The weird thing with nonEX fireballs in this game is that in the midrange you throw them out when you have a read that the opponent doesnt want to approach on the ground in every other game its the opposite where you throw the fireball when they dont want to jump and are focused on playing the ground game.You really need to get comfortable with knowing which antiairs beat what.

6809085,0,t3_48zmbl,If they really insist on keeping survival as the method to unlock colors heres how I think they could make the process a LOT less painfulMake survival mode an ACTUAL survival mode as in unlimited enemies that you eventually lose to. When you do lose you get a certain number of Color Points based on how many enemies you beat what the difficulty was set to how many boosts you took etc. You could then use Color Points to unlock the colors you want at a store. If they really wanted to they could make Color Points be locked to a specific character so that the colors you unlock are an actual representation of your success with them in survival.This would make survival be about kicking ass for as long as you can and constantly progressing towards a goal rather than wasting an hour on hard and quitting due to frustration when you die after  rounds.,StreetFighter,d0o3u9x,7,t5_2qnu5

6814786,0,t1_d0oqel4,I usually mess around with the whole cast for a while once I start getting bored of constantly using my main like Ive done for pretty much the entire month since the game dropped. From there it goes down two different paths. I see which characters I like to play for fun characters that might be entertaining as hell to play with but I realistically dont see picking up as a secondary. And the other path is who I would consider as a secondary for real depending on varying factors Do they counter my mains bad MUs? Does this character have even worse MUs? How much fun are they to play? etc.As for when is a good time to learn? Depends on how seriously you take the game. If youre serious about gitting gud then a pocket character to counter bad MUs is always handy early on especially if you play a character with very bad ones Gief. But if youre comfy with where youre at now I wouldnt worry too much about picking an outright secondary just yet.

6836905,0,t3_49dnwh,Interesting. Personally I feel Karin Ryu and Cammy are for sure better than Mika Rashid and FANG. Mika and Rashid both seem to have somewhat linear gameplans and Im not sure are going to stand the test of time against charactersplayers who can leverage their stronger buttons and fundamentals. Mikas damage is just crazy but it really feels like she has to get a good read to really get to use it. Fangs damage output is just so low that he feels a lot like sim in sf where he has to work extremely hard to get the win.Cammy and Ryu both have strong buttons and the ability to really excel with strong fundamentals. Once you play against a cammy who can leverage her movespeed in a game of slow characters and vtrigger she really starts to shine IMO. Ryus all around game just seems good.This is my opinion if anyone wants any more explanation I would be happy to type out my thoughts. ,StreetFighter,d0r9kmw,1,t5_2qnu5

6851968,0,t1_d0sxajs,Gief does a ton of damage and grapplers typically are not easy to get inside on you normally keep them out.  What is Dhalsim going to do to open Zangief up if Gief gets the life lead?  Some teleport shenanigans?  Its not hard to avoid Dhalsims setups when youre playing defensively.  Dhalsim has a shitty wakeup if Gief scores a knockdown dumps Dhalsim down the toilet then backs off and plays the life lead yeah I think its pretty even.Normally Gief favors screen position and is willing to trade life.  Gief players have to recalibrate that mentality.edit Downvote all you want this reminds me of when people were saying Throws are bad. Ken is shitty. All normals are too stubby. Everyone plays footsies from the same range. The damage in this game sucks.

6868192,0,t1_d0utbgg,Thats the hope but I think there are several things wrong with that assumption. First the players you are paired up against seems to be completely random. In fact Id say that I play against people within  LP of me less frequently than any other LP gap. Its usually someone  LP above or below which makes no sense. And trust me Im all about the long haul but if a  win ratio doesnt get you out of bronze I dont really see the ranking system spreading out any more than it is now with only  of the base in silver albeit a majority of them ragequitters. When the ranking system is working right you should be facing people of equal skill level. That means for any given fight you should have a  chance of winning.

I know most of her combos and her renowned cross under that only works on bronze players  unless you perform a command grab after the cross under cause higher rank players usually just block. Anyways I do pretty good until players catch me on a guessing game during my wake up. Laura has no good wake up game and its basically a freaking guessing game which kills me always.

6912267,0,t1_d0ztitv,Yeah Ive played Zangief already and Laura. With Gief he has to really work to get in there more than any of the grapplers and needs the corner but he has a harder time getting them there and can only setup after a hp or ex spd. Or if you jab them to death the may just hold down back and then you can running bear them but that takes some conditioning.Laura on the other hand has to usually jump at some point and start opening people up with frame traps of which she has plenty but with her its just about knowing when its your turn and whiff punishing her stubby normals.

6915467,0,t3_4agisr,Ive always had the theory that in order to compete at a very high levelwere talking making top  at EVO for example. some level of intelligence is necessary and in addition quick thinking. Take Snake Eyez for example. When he plays Zangief against high level opponents I would argue that its far more about the mental game than the technical game that Gief demands. Mind games conditioning opponents noticing habits of other players and adapting ones strategy in order to take advantage of them all of these things require some measure of intelligence. While I dont believe one needs to be a genius to be great at SFthere are plenty of examples of that not being the case incredibly quick thinking is probably a necessary talent to compete at the highest of levels. ,StreetFighter,d106vvi,2,t5_2qnu5

6935702,0,t1_d12cjgn,I get that and agree alot but its just a way to add some depth to a game. I do agree that it would be better just to have one complete character with a well rounded move set but in the sense of variations change play style I feel like the early system would be better.  A character with one fat move set is more likely to be unbalanced and a jack of all trades deal. I dont want a world where the aspect of god like zoning high rush down and great buttons are in one character. It would be infuriating. that is where we get s Chun and no one wants that again. Having everyone be fat move set characters would be optimal but this game is designed specifically for lower execution and more reactive game play so they limit options on purpose.

Not every sprite that accentuates a certain body part is sexist.To call her highly sexualized when her clothing doesnt even reveal any skin is absurd its a complete insult to her iconic and modest design.Shes feminine sure.

7065813,0,t1_d1h9fmn,I see where hes coming from. Most sticks people use are the Hori RAP  or various MadCatz sticks since they come with solid toptier parts Hori Sanwa.Most sticks of a lower price point usually have knock off Chinese parts in them and either are too small like the various mini sticks or are made cheaply. The Mayflash V and Venom are the only two midtier sticks that are worth getting and thats mainly because they have solid cases the parts in them are Chinese knockoffs but theyre also some of the easiest sticks to mod you just need Phillips and flathead screwdrivers.The Venom most people go for between the two because of PS compatibility and unfortunately leads to it costing around  in the States or  if you sneakily import it from the UK.If youre PC the Mayflash V should work great though. Its only  right now and you can save up to mod it with Sanwa parts which are the parts used in most goodtop quality sticks and only spend an extra . So virtually? Youre going to have to pay nearly  either way but the VVenom are the only sub sticks worth getting.I thought I could never get a fightstick because of the high upfront cost but got the Mayflash V and modded it with all the crazy colors I wanted and will suggest it any time I can.  ,StreetFighter,d1h9t5a,2,t5_2qnu5

Mostly its just muscle memory like any other motion. One of the really important things Ive learned so far is knowing when not to charge.

7103458,0,t1_d1kn7cn,Necalli s.HK is  in guard if he is doing it too close punish with b.MP TC etc a bit further s.LPqcf.HK.You can place yourself so that his s.HK will either whiff punish cr.MKqcf.MK or be close enough so that you will be able to punish it.My gameplan is to stock VTSuper so that I can kill him outright just before he has enough meter to activate his own VT. Before that I use my superior move speed and normals to keep him out. Necalli has more life and damage. However you are more mobile and have better normals. So play to your strengths and minimize the risk to let him play to his.Try to lame him out he will start to use his vskill you can punish it with qcf.MK if you make it whiff. On reaction its really hard to punish it because it will hit the start up of the spiral. The recover is really long though. Thats why I try to stay just inside s.HK punishable range around Necalli cr.MK tip or just outside of it to make it whiff and punish vskill on reaction.Learn to DP when you see him cancel normal into stomp. If it doesnt come out it means that it was blockstring and a LK stomp and you can just s.LPqcf.HK to punish him most of the time.After he knocks you down with disc most Necalli do dash s.HP if you wake up fast it will hit meaty and beat your f for high dmg. If you see him do this wake up back and whiff punish him with s.HPqcf.HK. If he does stomp guard or hell be able to combo if it trade.Once in VT the s.HK is  hes freaking fast and his stomp are less neg or even  for HK. So ... good luck.,StreetFighter,d1ljstw,2,t5_2qnu5

Optimising your training room experience will give you the right mindset to learn and apply. Things are better than ever with record wakeupguard recovery like record jab on both and practice guaranteed pressure and oki. I wouldnt describe it as set play but having clarity in your offensive options keeps you from dropping spaghetti everywhere. Knockdown? I have meaty setups. Punishable move? Optimised damage or a reset. Neutral game? I know my normals. Its not just strategy but you can rewatch your replays and test character specific punishes. Oh and learning frame data is always good.

Dont let Bison continue pressure after you block a special thats your turn or at the worst reset to a neutral situation.His wakeup is god awful pressure him there. He has no option but block to deal with a properly timed meaty and once you show you have that timing get to tossing him.When he is just outstide of poke range and is looking for a dash in mixup put normals in the space he is going to be in. He loses invincibility prior to recovering from the dash hell materialize right into it. Be aware that in Vtrigger Devils Reverse is going to cross up.

For those who dont know what happens is some of his normals and specials those done with M and H punches have a deflect window. Its kind of like armor but better  of the opponent connects during that window Tusk takes no damage and staggers his opponent which makes sure that the move he was throwing out will connect and the opponent will be unable to block no matter how long its startup is.,StreetFighter,d1mylcj,7,t5_2qnu5

I think KI plays better than SFV strictly because it has actual working netcode. Im also going to preface my next point by saying this is my opinion. But im in the corner of Smsh not being a fighting game.  Sakurai himself said its not a fighting game.

I dont think that SFV can make the excuse that it hasnt been out that long and thats why it doesnt have content. KI used to be awful when it came out and they fixed the problems. SFV can do that same but when you have a franchise like SF thats been around for years you should have known better.,StreetFighter,d1o1e1j,3,t5_2qnu5

Your comment about Chuns EX Bird being unsafe...everyone who has an invincible reversal is unsafe when they do it.  At least hers cant be hit out of if you hit her in the legs like Nashgt Also vTrigger is close to guaranteed combo into CA with nash andor escape....this is raw use too not into a comboThis is just flat untrue.  The way you make it seem is that you dont know how to deal with Nash and his Vtrigger so it seems overpowered to you.  People have issues with Chun because she is good.  you say its because of her normals and yes that is what makes her so damn good.

7144858,0,t3_4depow,To start Go to training room the lab in fighting game parlance and fiddle around with characters. Look at every move and I mean every move including all the normals single button attacks. Figure out if you wanna focus on someone or even just a little style like quick attacks burst damage long distance attacks strong defence etc.Version? Well Im biased with my rpcmasterrace side but yeah at least PC is decent.Controller Doesnt have to be a stick. Gamepads are popular as are stickless controllers. Main requirements should be comfort and dexterity.Diving in We have a wiki for quick descriptions of characters a Friday Newbie Fight Lobby a Daily General Questions thread and you can submit a fight video for us to critique. uJoeMunday is pretty popular here for knowing Zangief especially. He made the Giefs Gym series here that should answer basically everything control related. Youtube is another good resource especially from Bafael.Other places to ask Shoryuken.com forums and look for a local fighting game community FGC.Other tips  This game eats practice time like popcorn.  hours isnt even close to getting decent at least not for a raw beginner.  No fireballs are not too difficult theyve been in fighting games since forever and everyone decent and their grandma has a way to beat them. No combos are not end all be all. Focus on getting the first hit before you start getting fancy. Get an easy and doable bread and butter BnB combo though so as not to waste damage.  Getting a friend to go on this journey with you can help a lot. Its okay to pick a difficult character but everyone recommends Ryu because hes very transparent. Its easier to see what you did wrong. People are not going to bend over backwards just because you cant do something in a match. Practice beating something that gives you trouble instead of whining. Dont be afraid to join small tournaments later on. Dont be afraid to abuse something as long as its within the rules. Its your opponents job to stop you dont make it easy.,StreetFighter,d1qamqt,12,t5_2qnu5

Mainly do it in a well ventilated area I didnt and just used a mask and with higher wattages try to be quick and confident.The main advice that I will give is that you want to be as prepared as you can be before you start messing with anything. I modded  sticks over the course of the week and the first was my first time ever messing with modding. The second time I labelled everything before hand had dissections of the PCB that I wanted to use and diagrams for the parts I was using.

There are certainly bad jump ins but people fail to realize that having a list of rules is inherently predictable and being predictable will get you fucked up by a lot of good players.I used to listen to people talking about when to do this and that until I realized you cant follow a flowchart to victory. If youre always taking the safest option and the opponent knows to expect this youre going to get shit on unless you start rolling the dice. Every opponent is different and every match is different.

7219852,0,t3_4ebyjj,How does your opponent do damage to you?  They have to move close enough to you in order to damage you.  That also means they have to move into the range of your attacks. Stop them from doing that by controlling space with your attacks. Controlling space is how you force people to play footsies with you.  You see high level players playing footsies with one another right off the get go because they each assume that the other is proficient at controlling space.If somebody comes into a game and sees that you cant anti air them or that you never press a button to stop their walk ups and dash ups theyll just keep exploiting that hole in your game and never give you a chance to play.  You need to force them to respect your options and work their way in past your space control. ,StreetFighter,d1yubmb,1,t5_2qnu5

7219913,0,t3_4ebyjj,Other people have made great posts Ill just add that you need a different mentality in fighting games as a beginner than other games. Your immediate goals cant be victory not for quite some time. They should be learning small fundamental concepts one at a time.If I had to recommend a super beginner guide to online play to demonstrate key fundamental concepts it would probably be the followingPlay birdie. Fight every opponents with  buttons st. Mk towards the edge of its range to keep them from approaching you cr. Lp when they whiff buttons in front of you to push them back out and cr. Mp when they jump at you. Figure out when to block when to tech throws. Try to identify whats punishable and what buttons can punish but dont worry about getting max damage. Youre not trying to win youre trying to develop a ground game.This is predictable and suboptimal but its about the best blank slate starting point I can think of in this game. IMHO it will teach you the ground game better than Ryu in  because fireballs carry more risk here and hes more aggressive and aggression requires more game knowledge to be successful.,StreetFighter,d1yukn8,3,t5_2qnu5

Just keep in mind that the nature of fighting games is very rockpaperscissory meaning that every problem has a solution. The solution may require a guess but it will always be there. As you start seeing situations try to understand them. Hit up training mode and recreate the situation with the AI and find the counters to it. Also watch proplay and try to understand why they do what they do.In the end it will take many hours and you will get schooled a lot but as you get better and understand the game more you will be able to find solutions to problems more and more in a sort of exponential growth process.,StreetFighter,d1zh5u8,1,t5_2qnu5

7245101,0,t3_4eniwj,All this is just people who never had an intention to get into the meat of fighting game complaining for the sake of complaining.Sure the launch of SFV was lackluster but I think saying that Capcom completely fucked up. Its over. This game has no future at all is jumping the gun and is an unfair judgment.In all fairness Capcom did say features like story mode shops etc. will be missing on launch. But a lot of people missed the memo and are acting as if Capcom lied to them. Dont get me wrong that doesnt excuse the fact that the game got shipped largely unfinished but to Capcoms credit they acknowledged the unfinished state of the game and promised to continue supporting the game for years to come. I think itd been a more fair criticism if these GB guys mentioned that. I bet they are clueless about any of this as theyre casual followers of FGC. if they follow at all The arguments they put out are rather onesided and inflammatory and I cant say I agree especially SFV is by their admission a really really solid fighting game at its core. thats the sacrifice Capcom had to make too. in order to ship the game in time they had to devote all their focus to polishing the gameplay and putting fluffs like single player modes off the priority list. personally I would rather have a SFV whose multiplayer is rock solid than a SFV whose single player is perfect but multiplayer is a shoddy buggy messSo far Capcom is sticking to their promise and adding a bunch of stuff more to come in the near future for the April update. If I were a dev at Capcom Id find people like these GB guys talking smack not encouraging to keep up the work. Its like these people are never happy no matter what I do.People like Totalbiscuit suggested that Capcom should have called the initial launch of the game SFV Tournament Edition to communicate that the game is primarily catered to the competitive crowd. I can see where theyre coming from but I feel that its a dangerous idea because it gives a lot of people a false impression that SFV will have multiple versions just like all the past SF games which Capcom explicitly stated they wont do. Had they done that I feel like people like GB guys would still complain mocking the Super ultra turbo tournament rainbow edition kind of naming.I feel like stuff like this is an audio form of clickbaiting. These guys are just flaming in order to grab more attention and views.Knowing Jeff no matter how SFV turned out he wouldnt fully appreciate the game anyway by continually playing it so him dropping the game I dont think is a loss to anybody in the FGC. after all what contributions did he make when SF was around other than play each iteration of it in its fist week and never touch it again? When EVO rolls around hell most likely hop on the bandwagon again and preach how good SFV is contradicting with everything he stated prior.To note though these GB guys also admitted that they dont have time to dedicate to learn how to get better at SF and still have the nerve to claim that its ridiculous if it takes dedication to get skilled in a game. These people have no idea how competitive gaming competitive anything really works. Theyre just so addicted to instant gratification.If you dont put in the time you wont get better at anything period. You wont just magically get good at Street Fighter one day mashing buttons.Acknowledging that youre a scrub and thus your perception on the game is considerably different from dedicated players is one thing but crying about how daunting it is for you to get good at the game and passiveaggressively mocking the dedicated competitive players by saying things like Im sorry I have a life is just pathetic.Im not sure how many people in this sub are familiar with EasyAllies but in one of their recent podcasts one guy said something along the lines of I sat through the tutorial went online and still cant win a match. Thats a sign that the game is poorly designed. Its mind boggling that a lot of people are naiive enough to believe that them not getting good at something without putting in effort is somehow a design flaw and is thus the games fault.You know how its so easy to blame others in games like MOBA and thats what a lot of people do to feel better about themselves? When theres no one else left to blame but yourself in a fighting game those people start blaming the game instead of themselves. Its baffling. ,StreetFighter,d21psaq,17,t5_2qnu5

7264570,0,t3_4etyd0,Headbutt and stomps are good against people who adapt against your normal setplay as well as being good fireball punishes and reads. Once youve taught the opponent to quick rise and block on wake up then you can start throwing out mpex headbutts after power bombs. Get used to holding down back after a power bombs so youll have the option to go for a meaty elbow or mpex headbutt along with your other options. I recommend going to training mode with random block random recovery and random counter and doing various confirm combos into a power bomb reset then practicing doing meaty elbowsfhp and confirming what to do next. If they block the elbow you should block. For in case the elbow hits keep charging down when you execute elbow on wakeup and you can do cheeky reset tricks like ex headbutt. Also good is cr. Mp after elbow. When executing a meaty fhp from a set up or slow recoveryalso alternate between fhp and power bomb on the aggressive slow wake up option you should be able to on reaction see if it blocks or hits. On block you need to practice landing your power bomb mp is a frame trap here for anybody who doesnt know. On hit expect them to have jumped instead of press buttons and be ready to confirm into v triggerfhp combos and be able to recognize when you do get the crush counter so you dont waste extra fhp damage when you do land it. Oh and unless you cant afford to or are conditioning the opponent its pretty good mind games to almost always go for the s in sledgehammer combos from mp chops. So thats basically my flowchart Alex after landing power bombs forward throws ex chops and the rare ex stomp. The ex headbutt after a lk elbow lands on their wake up isnt perfect but I dont think its bad. Interchanging the stomp is also good but I have done less work with that. That move I use a lot when I am at a lead and am trying to use creative ways to apply pressure from midacross stage if I am afraid to use headbutt. Its not a super great move until you start fucking with people or they wake up crouch block every time. So have fun maybe going for lows and practicing meaty cr mk into v trigger to teach them that? Also more random stuff as Alex you have to pay close attention to spacing so you can use the correct anti air. Too many people read me almost only use jab anti airs which are amazing mix ups on their own! God bless power bombfhp which can be somewhat countered by the opponent jumping in from far away. Keep watching and trying to learn when people want to jump so you can throw a mkex knee or be ready with cr. Hp. Or jab. Sorry for the Alex ramble. I didnt think it would make sense without explaining the setplay I use not that unique and also theres no way this comment doesnt help the new Alex player. ,StreetFighter,d23xi0g,1,t5_2qnu5

So you can start the grab and be on the th frame of startup by the time the opponent is yet to even start his startup of the throw. Exact numbers depend with what you antiair and how high it connects but its quite a bit of advantage have a training mode dummy set to jump and Antiair him then hold up to jump you can see just how much sooner you can jump compared to your opponent.,StreetFighter,d24rpto,2,t5_2qnu5

7308318,0,t3_4fhpcx,The unique thing about Street Fighter is that its seriously all up to you. If you are absolutely dead set on a character learning how your character deals with every other character is a gigantic step in the right direction for improvement.  ampnbsp  Playing other characters outside of your main gives you a look into how your main can beat that character. For example I main Gief and Vega gives me some of the worst trouble Ive ever had. Im going to start learning Vega so I can hopefully start having an easier time in the MU.  ampnbsp  If youre considerably new to Street Fighter IMO the way to get better is to learn the interactions of  character you main vs the rest of the cast. You dont have to learn every single in and out but it makes things a hell of a lot less scary going up against a Bison when youre playing Alex and have VTrigger youll know that you can VTrigger his slides and dunk his ass.  ampnbsp  There is also absolutely nothing wrong with not being able to cement a main.

I drew straight lines from some key points on Guiles anatomy and all of them hit above Ryus equivalent anatomyGuiles shoulders are at the top of Ryus head.Guiles eyes hit the top of Ryus forehead.Guiles waist hits just below Ryus chest.Guiles knees hit Ryus thighs.In SFII all of those points line up straight across the two characters.Conclusion Guiles been taking some serious human growth hormones.Disclaimer I could be crazy and this is all just in my head.,StreetFighter,d2aokfi,0,t5_2qnu5

USF now joins the status of other amazing games such as ST A and S...a historic game still played by a small core audience of fans who think it was the greatest game ever. Theres nothing wrong with that and I hope people who really liked SF will keep it alive and strong in that way. But that being said old games in ANY series are meant to fade from the forefront. Just like those other games there is a place for side tournaments and special events just for them. If you really love and believe in SF then step up and keep your scene going! Organize events make things happen. Itd be cool to see some kind of tournament where new games arent present but S and USF are the main events wouldnt it?

7478200,0,t3_4htdih,Definitely worth reducing arm movement but not sure the angle produced here will be ideal for everyone.Biggest help for me was to change from the grip I had been using stick between ring and middle finger to the wine glass stick between pinky and ring finger. Completely personal preference but I find it far more comfortable and when my hand is relaxed its easy to do quick precise movements. If you are new to a stick just give both a try. The key is to allow your hand time to adjust though so try not to change things too often. The other thing that helped was letting the stick pop back to neutral. Under pressure Id go from down to back directly and end up over or under shooting it resulting in jumping back or crouching instead of backing up. If you just release tension let the stick find neutral again on its own then picking your next direction is simpler IMO.,StreetFighter,d2s88ez,2,t5_2qnu5

7484201,0,t3_4hw6cl,I mean yeah...Thats the basic idea. Though when you start getting up into more higher leveled play some players will intentionally go for unsafe finishes like  or  so not super unsafe but just enough to get your opponent to try and commit to something. In that  to two frame window that you created for your opponent you then have a choice. You can let it be their turn to press buttons or you can even go for some unsafe stuff yourself. Look at Rashid for example. St HK is  on block so most people think that its their turn to press buttons and in most cases it is. However if Rashid has meter he can use EX Spinning Mixer to stop you from pressing buttons. Though as you can probably guess its not the safest option but its part of his strength. A lot of the time youre so caught up in his strings and speed you get easily overwhelmed. Just food for thought but the basic idea of hit confirms you have down fairly well. ,StreetFighter,d2swuox,3,t5_2qnu5

Tigerknee is qcb ufkIt is very hard to tigerknee the the regular divekick the ex is much easier. When doing this you have to delay pressing the kick buttons a bit as you need to reach that specific height.As for regular divekicks just do them without the tigerknee.

It was an opinion based on specific pieces of evidence and was never touted as fact. I was simply insinuating to Capcom that I hoped the best for them regarding SFs future because Ive been worried regarding their recent performances. The problem with every single comment you have made since the beginning was because they were made under the assumption that I was actually claiming that SFCapcom was really failing and your recent comment above absolutely confirmed that.Ive told you over and over to reread my point made post after post hoping you found what was fundamentally flawed about your logic but yet you still failed to see it even by now unsurprisingly. There you are guns blazing yet sadly never hitting the target. I know it kind of looks like I played you like a puppet but really you just kind of sabotaged yourself.

Plus any medium or higher counterhit instantly combos right into an activation for either a mix up or a full combo. Being able to get that much off of a  midrange poke is more valuable to me.

7619452,0,t1_d3865u6,Daigo made a guide about his strategy for when playing as Ryu. SummarizedAt long range Dont sit back and use hadoken Dhalsim wins long range game.  You want to get in close to him. Whiff punish st.MK with l.DPCC sweep preferably sweep because it lets you gain more ground. If you expect him to do a st.HK do a jumpin attack sweep whiffs on st.HK.At medium range Use cr.MP to pokecounterpoke Dhalsims light attacks and drills trades with drills. If you jump in use j.LK as it leaves you in a favorable position close to Dhalsim.Other stuff If he cancels into Vtrigger on block use Vreversal and it will hit him out of it before the flames appear. If he air teleports you do a reverse m.DP if he didnt teleport near you st.mp will come out. If he teleported behind he will get DPed if he teleported in front he will get st.mped.If you play a different character I suppose your tools would be a bit different but same general principles apply.  Like if you were playing Alex I suppose you could armor through Dhalsims pokes with EX Elbow and replace DP with m.Air Knee Smash for the teleport.

In practice when hes actively moving between a great keep away game and so many options for entry youre bound to slip up. A fundamental portion of the mind game is overloading the opponent with information and having them focus too much on a certain portion of the game allowing you to exploit their lack of focus on some other portion.

7751836,0,t3_4lh09q, I like it online is slowly improving its different to previous SF games every SF game is unique and difficult to compare tbh. Give it time it will be great.  No execution heavy combos is my only gameplay complain but the difficulty to time properly meaties unlike previous tittles and such makes up for it.  Long queues and long loading times plus an awkward interface are my general complains about the game. This can be solved and I bet it will be fixed in the long run. An option to turn off VSync would be appreciated for those who play on PS very easy to fix. I find WAY less laggy matches recently but the  bars are not  reliable yet I hope they improve that too it also happened in SF lets not forget that. I dont care about ranks nor RQers tbh but thats another thing to adress for players who like grinding rankeds. We knew that the game was half done at release and the release was rough. But it still brand new give it time! Stay away from it if you need it untill it gets a few fixes or a character that grabs your attention. The game is GOOD the product not yet.

7790436,0,t3_4m17s8,Its tough to say. On one hand I think they should have waited as long as it took to get a complete product to market. Theres so much about this game that just screams placeholder or unfinished. On the other hand I feel USFs hype was dwindling and the community was ready for a new game. Granted that might have been due to  being announced but we will probably never know for sure.Personally Im all for delays if they mean better products. Im not disappointed in the fighting or the roster. Im bummed out that the game doesnt accomplish all of the things that Capcom stated were their main goals. Im also bummed out by the overall vibe of the game. Theres no style to its UI. No announcer with crazy lines. The online experience is far behind what is offer by the wider market of online esports.

You havent even adressed this issue and the Steam forum is full of it.The rage quit penalty is the only bigger thing you patched in outside of regular updates that I can think of and to be quite frank its garbage and people still rage quit like crazy and your leaderboard is now full of bots seriously like  out of the top  are bots what gives.I do think the idea is good and makes sense in general yes but not the way you guys are doing it.Heres what a changelog for a similar game pay full prize get a lot of updates named Elite Dangerous looks like.

For example if you get a knockdown you can walk to your opponent and do a st.lk it only link if done meaty gt st.mk gt cr.mp xx disc guidance. This example is a combo without a jumpin. Other example you can do your ex command grab and when they bounce on the wall you do a jab to reset the opponent then you do a st.hp xx mk stomp gtcr.mp xx disc guidance.

It might turn people off.That said other people have made the point that the liquipedia also has a strong focus on the esports side of things.

7958220,0,t1_d4ai2gv,Ill agree with you on the viewer decline over time but there may be a spike due to the game being new. gt Street Fighter is perfect for ESPN.I cant see how this is true though. Half the fun of watching these tournaments was the personalities involved in them. Luckily we have KBrad and some others but this game is already souring on some pro players. The hypestmost fun shit is slowly being eliminated by Capcom at CPT event aka no thuggery. In terms of gameplay a lot of players I found really fun to watch in  are just either nonexistent in  or flat up boring to watch because the game at least to me lacks personality. gt Its in a perfect position and if it takes a bit for Capcom to get upandrunning I will happily continue to support it.It really isnt though. A lot of people are unhappy with all of the technical issues. It should have been in the perfect position but it isnt simply due to Capcoms lack of communication and poor gameplay decisions. gt I hope the community doesnt A.D.DTinderdate it and abandon it so quickly.Theres absolutely nothing wrong with quitting on a game you dont have fun playing. Look at pro players people like Rog and Snake are actively bashing the game on stream. Snake has a point when he says The only reason pros are even playing this game is because Capcom put a lot of money into the pro tour. Other fighting games do what this game does a lot better. The only difference is they arent named Street Fighter so street fighter is basically the face of the FGC despite the game being uncomplete and subpar.,StreetFighter,d4akusk,3,t5_2qnu5

Also by way of reference Im sub  usually  or less for Starcraft and Overwatch.

The game already had an insanely hype top  last year and it will only get better. When I see a lot of posters here on rstreetfighter trying to defend SFV a lot of times I think of the phrase ignorance is bliss. Meaning I think this is the first time a lot of you guys are actually trying to get into fighters so its like a brand new world pretty euphoric feeling. And thats great Im glad people are enjoying playing fighting games and if SFV had a decent tutorial like Xrds I would recommend it to anyone starting off with the genre. But as it stands I think the game was poorly made a lot of UI decisions are questionable and it is very barebones to boot.

Its just play super solid.One thing though that I feel no Guile player myself included has really explored is how to use V trigger in neutral.  Like having set mix ups for like heavy boom with a slow boom following it.  Or forward dash then immediately HPHK for a non charged boom.

8296823,0,t1_d5ekdl7,The current system is more expensive. Going into Ultra if you had the game it cost you  and you got new stages to go with it which is nice. Now Im SFV every new character cost about  bucks so for this year thats a total of  dollars. You can save money by doing the season pass though which costs  dollars also how convenient that Capcom started selling the season pass and never mentioned how much characters were gonna be individually until like last month. Which is the same price as switching to Ultra but you dont get the stages. Weve gotten one stage this year but that was because Capcom apologized for fucking up at the launch and the launch of the first DLC. Then you take a look at how DLC was back in SFIV and compare it to now. Now a costume costs  dollars per character. Back in SFIV you used to pay four to six dollars prices I just checked on steam for five costumes. If you wanted to save money for  dollars youd have costumes for the entire roster. All  characters that much money only gets you  characters in SFV. So yea if you like paying more or getting less for your dollar then sure SFVs new method is better than the old but otherwise SFV is just pure shit in terms of buying extras. ,StreetFighter,d5ent8u,-3,t5_2qnu5

8306377,0,t1_d5eq1ot,monetary incentive. Id do it for free. Most modders would do it for free honestly. Theres already a mod out that fixes the beach stage. And for a guy thats been working with the Unreal Engine  on the new UT with the community  its incredibly easy to fix that stuff and make maps if you have the static meshes already ready which they have! Even those small map events like the noodles. One person can do that in a day. Its a small event. People think this takes much work when theres full games with assets made from scratch made by  guy on UE in a couple of months? Take the fact that most games need huge thought on geometry and Fighting games are mostly decoration you dont need to code anything in the maps like collision etc.  and not not only they are taking too much time for simple fixes  they are also charging way too much for the work thats done. Just for a perspective. Top artists ask for  an hour max. For a map they need a concept artist and an enviroment designer. That means it doesnt even take  to create  map. So if  people would buy that  map  they would be profiting. They can definitely lower the prices and make more stuff. This is based on them outsourcing stuff to freelancers which is already confirmed such as the ibuki model. If they are willing to do it for models that are way more expensive they are for simple stages aswell,StreetFighter,d5fur15,1,t5_2qnu5

During one of his streams he said that he is very disappointed that SFV has no arcade release.  He said growing up going to the arcade and playing against different people and making new friends is why he even started playing fighting games and the younger generation today wont get to experience that in SFV.  He feels bad because going to the arcade is how you find training partners to level up with.  The younger generation is who will suffer because he already knows people and has training partners so he can just ask guys like Tokido Fuudo Bonchan used to be roommates to come over and play sets but new players are forced to play online which is not the same experience.Hearing that he invited a young kid to his stream really shows he cares about the younger generations development.

Find the proper spacing where the Mika feels she can get in and the rack up damage as best you can with well spaced pokes and whiff punishes. Dont forget about your dirty mixup game but wait until youve flustered the Mika. It can be a pain in the ass getting kept out as a grappler as I imagine youve experienced so try to frazzle your foe. Once you feel the tempo has shifted in your favor then try to go on the offense a bit more. Unfortunately I dont play against Laura often mostly play offline vs a Gief or Alex so I dont have any matchup specific knowledge I can bring to the table. I would however be more than happy to play you if youd like. Im WooperScooper on CFN in Texas. Question to those more knowledgeable than myself is the St. HK considered airborne?

I dont want to spend my entire resource bar on something that is essentially a more powerful EX move with a  second startup cinematic especially if in previous games the same character had something much cooler. Juri is a good example. Kaisen Dankairaku wasnt the best Ultra but it sure as hell looked awesome.    Short ones are boring. Its short and sweet and can be somewhat satisfying in cases like Balrogs but its incredibly anticlimactic. You can enjoy your short ones all you like but to complain that theyre just too long or distracting seems like a nonissue because they really arent that long. The longest one is like what..  seconds?

Conversely its frustrating to know that Ive had to work on antiairing with s.HPcr.HPEX Ressenha a lot and then somebody can just pick up Necalli or Chun and antiair with s.LP or s.LK into a free mixup with no problem.If necessary they should buff legit antiairs to make up for nerfing antiair jab.

A ft or ft might take as long losing two fts or fts but removes the downtime it takes to set up the match in the first place in half.

Meanwhile SFV is a full priced game while offering nothing but  hours of cheesy nonsense and a multiplayer mode. This article proves that the games shelflife is almost over. They overshipped at launch and havent had to resupply much over the last few months at all. And the players that remain cannot keep the game going to the point where they would go beyond Season  unless the price drops radically. My guess would be that the game goes FP since it is already using a FP model at full price XDBut right now the perspective of a new buyer will beOh wow this tournament is pretty cool.

8789056,0,t3_50g8s1,Oh man I really want to figure out how to make this character work at one point. Im working on my Karin for a tourney coming up in a few weeks but theres something about Juri too that just makes me want to play her more. So I guess really what I need to start working on is better Juri training lab segments. Back when I was learning Tenkos on Karin I spent so much time per day in the lab before going and failing to do them in matches. I think for Juri an important thing I need to do is just work on the light hit confirms since it feels like those are important for when you have no resources or when youre being pressured too much. Also I always ask this but who do you guys watch for Juri contentmatches? I have the name of someone on the rStreetFighter discord however Id like to discover more Juri videos of other people playing them so I have more info to draw from when learning her better.,StreetFighter,d74b1pn,1,t5_2qnu5

Depends what platform youre using it for. It largely comes down to what looks best to you for manufacturers like Madcatz.  Since they pretty much all use the same kind of sticks and buttons for the most part. But. Before worrying about what hardware to play games on and what other people like  you could learn the difference between marked and market. Or how to proofread if you already know the difference.

8997478,0,t3_53ik15,The ability to only do the Shoryuken when they get the hit is called a hit confirm. Essentially its a combo that gives you enough time to identify if your normals have connected. If not finish the block string on a normal that has good frame data to continue to press the advantage. If the combo connects you go for a special to get the damageknock down and continue to press them with offense. The best way to practice this is to find a combo preferably one that is like  hits and find a good special to end it with or see the combos pros are doing and go into training mode set the CPU to random block. You will start the combo on the CPU if they block do not do the special move at the end if they do not block end with the special move. Do this until you are comfortable in your ability to do this consistently. ,StreetFighter,d7tcvmi,6,t5_2qnu5

Team YP something similar through people visiting the YouPorn site and increasing their ad plays even if they say thats not their goal.But the rKappa fundraisers are a one way road. No one makes profit off rKappa traffic outside unrelated Reddit employees and so their incentive isnt to get profit. Its to enable players they want to see go play.

9135539,0,t3_55ervr,Some quick feedback  I appreciate the in depth data but Im really not a fan of having so many entries for a single move Uriens st.HK has  entries and those occupy pretty much the whole frame data screen. I dont think frame advantage on taller or crouching characters warrants extra move entries only charged ones should imo as they alter the move significantly. This kind of details could go under the Extra Information box when expanding the move just like it already happens with some moves like Divekicks they have less frame advantage if they hit higheron taller characters or certain Overheads Ryus overhead in SF is usually listed at  with extra notes mentioning that it is only  on crouchers. I dont think these details would go unnoticed as FAT already shows with the blue ! icon when theres extra data. tldr only list Uriens st.HK and charged st.HK like FAT already does with his st.HP any extra info should be listed under the moves own details page. A bug  Trying to expand one of Uriens  st.HK entries FAT redirects me to the welcome screen. Restarting the app didnt fix this. Minor stuff  There are some damagestun values not properly updated for VTrigger Necalli. I havent checked all the entries most seems fine but some of the ones I found are VT HK Stomp says  Damage VT bumps it up to  VT VSkill says  Damage stun should be  and all of his VT DPs damage and number of hits arent updated. Also while technically not wrong Necallis Lunges in VT become multihit damage is correctly updated but FAT lists it as a single hit ie VT MP Lunges damage is listed as  but being a hit moves it should be .  Read in the changelog that certain moves not having common names was fixed so I went and checked Ibuki as she had a tons of those. Common names now show up correctly with the exception of Gogasha. Sorry for the long post as always thanks for your work on FAT!,StreetFighter,d89zv2b,6,t5_2qnu5

No. But if nobody ever bought anything until a perfect version hit the market nothing would ever be sold.Its not like there is a Street Fighter clone providing competition.

9207481,0,t3_56f441,I feel that its a mixture of issues.Firstly since the games scores are allocated directly to an overall rank in tiers a lot of players have trouble getting out of the initial Rookie and Bronze rankings due to still learning the game. But because the ranking is a little more emphasized than in IV and dropping the character ranks altogether in favor of a tier structure players may be bent on the idea of being in rank limbo and with that pressure performing worse.As someone who played fighting games seriously for a good number of years numbers and wins are something I dont look at and more so focus on my mistakes and improvement. But to a newcomer the piling losses can be rather demoralizing and combined with the rage quitting issue months after release some players can feel like theyre only seeing losses and feel pressured at ranking up yet not focus on learning from their mistakes.Another large issue is how daunting the games present themselves with little tools to teach newcomers. Im thankful Ive had friends who taught me the fundamentals because learning the basic inputs combos footsies etc can be overwhelming to someone who just picked up the game and is new to the genre. Granted you cant learn fundamentals overnight and seeing progress does take time and practice it would be nice for Capcom to implement a player involved tutorial that walks the newcomer through the basics and applicable situations to use those skills like Revelator did in its tutorial. The videos that SF V have are a step in the right direction but simple clips with text dont really hold up much to player involvement in teaching these mechanics. You can tell a person what an anti air is and show them a video but it doesnt help when the player just sees it without involvement and doesnt understand the situations that can be ideal to use this knowledge. Context plays heavily in character abilities.Personally I have had a good number of friends who bought Street Fighter V at launch yet sold it within a couple of months for those reasons among others. The common lining I found in their reasoning was winning far few in between with ranked and feeling like they are thrown into a huge number of mechanics without an understanding of how to use them. With the former eventually they have to accept losses and learn from their mistakes to enjoy good moments which I can still sympathize with back when I was terrible at Street Fighter but the latter is an issue that Capcom may need to look more into. It can be kind of hard to feel compelled to jump in as a newcomer when the challenge involves jumping deep into a breadth of foreign concepts without any sort of help.,StreetFighter,d8j47ss,4,t5_2qnu5

9242493,0,t1_d7wvn86,Well I didnt mention GGPO or rather the lack thereof in my post but the thing about that is we blamed what we Felt on the netcode early on because we didnt know what the actual issue was.  it was Input lag in the game in general.As for gameplay Really its hard to express without playing hundreds of games.  Its not that most of your gameplay changes had unintended effects etc... but many many in contrast to the one or two changes most commonly mentioned eg fake fireball cancels. Ive read through your articles Even back before release I followed the capcom blogs and your posts almost religiously checking every day for updates.   Im not going to say much else about it. As we know from the SRK days and earlier We can theory fighter all day and go nowhere. People can read through your articles play the game watch it being played and decide if they agree or not.  I agree with probably  of what youve written in those articles and disagree with about . A significant portion of the current ST competitive community probably feels the same way Drop by NHC on facebook were always trying to find people to contact you and have a discussion trying to dispel myths and get at the truth of some rumors that still float around to this day And I think that  is what drove people away from HDR back to ST.  That being said personally I dont mind HDR. except for the input lag.  of the controversial changes I only have an issue with portions of it not enough to drive me away if it wernt for the . input lag and . feedback loop of needing players for competition gt HDR losing them gt More people thinking HDR doesnt have enough players gt more people dropping HDR...I would probably still be playing HDR to this day. and HDR did bring a lot of good to the community as a whole although it did not lead to a successful game.So Now I own  arcade boards bring them to tournaments and am reviving the ST scene in east coast. along with the socal guys doing awesome work in the west coast too! It would definitely be a much harder job if HDR didnt exist.,StreetFighter,d8njx8u,1,t5_2qnu5

9482489,0,t1_d9ek2fa,I understand its discouraging playing ST at this point since many players are at the very least at an intermediate or high level of play but I recommend to keep at it.Besides ST being fairly simple to learn theres a very strong presence of players and organizers in the community that are very dedicated and passionate to helping players grow.  It is a fairly common site to hear of advice given by good players on how to beat certain strong tactics or how to handle matchups even if its technically advice that might one day make you a threat to guys like them.  Ive gone through this experience myself and Ill tell you firsthand I wouldnt get to where I am today if it wasnt for the generous help of the community who happily heaps advice and tips on me to help sharpen my skill set.  Quirks like coin toss throws and odd hithurtboxes arent so bad.  Its technically not a coin toss and in a vast majority of cases its the better player with better throw timing that gets it.  It is extremely rare for two players to time a throw on the EXACT same frame and thus it is a skill you can improve upon.  There are also things like reversal specialsuper moves to consider along with counter throws along with throw techs to make the throw game a bit more varied and manageable.  As far as hithurt boxes those are explained in the SRK ST Wiki.  They have a complete set of hithurt box examples and is a great tool to use to understand howwhy a move works the way it does as well as options to counter it.  I myself use this source heavily to fine tune my counter options and thus have discovered fairly rare or unusual counters I see few others utilizing.  At a high level ST becomes very expressive of your personal style despite its limited game mechanics which is where the real fun of Street Fighter begins.I recommend new people to go about playing by either showing up to local events or playing online at Fightcade   The latter is a free online client to fight other people via the internet and currently gets continued support from its developer in the way of expanded games list replays and eventually a leaderboards ranking system and updated emulator.  At the current state it is filled with beginner and intermediatelevel players so its a great way to start your path on becoming a better ST player!Besides this another good method is to ask questions such as the ones you posed.  The ST scene at large LOVES to help new players and even casual spectators understand and appreciate this game at any level you wish to.  ,StreetFighter,d9hx671,2,t5_2qnu5

9499052,0,t1_d9jw95d,Dont get me wrong Capcom is definitely still the main culprit but the people actively trying to stop this game from improving are giving Capcom quite the help while doing really no good to themselves or their community.And Im doubtful that the other games worth playing will see any increase in attention should SF go down if anything they will only be pushed into further obscurity. KoF and Guilty Gear arent selling any better in spite of everyone praising them and SFVs many shortcomings Mortal Kombat sold great but competitively really isnt the best I dont see any franchise able to replace the role that Street Fighter historically had for the FGC except maybe Tekken and I dont know how that series fared from a competitive point of view in the past. Street Fighter going down would be a huge blow for the FGC and its potential growth as an esport for sure I find it hard to see things otherwise.,StreetFighter,d9jyl0h,1,t5_2qnu5

9648985,0,t3_5cy4i3,When I go into any game that allows you to choose a character. I pick who has  coolness factor  and  is actually good enough to help me have an easier time. So I picked Nash yeah I knew he was top tier but I also knew that tiers mean NOTHING at lower and mid ranks. He was definitely cool but not a beginner friendly character at all in my opinion. After I got level  with him I havent played him and over a month and a half. Thats because i was busy learning how to play  different charactersI can now play Ryu ken Bison alex urien balrog and cammy at goldultra gold levels. Ive gotten gold with Ryu super gold with Alex and ultra gold with Bison on different accounts. I dont consider myself to have a main anymore because of how often I switch characters. Everytime I face a platinum Nash it makes me realize how shitty my Nash was and still is compared to Nash mains.Tldr it was Nash for a couple of months. Now I constantly switch between multiple different characters success. Now my Nash is super rusty and underdeveloped,StreetFighter,da2fr2s,1,t5_2qnu5

9667574,0,t1_da4oj3d,Im glad you enjoyed it and found it helpful!    Keeping your opponent in the corner can be a bitch but its a skill that when practiced well can mean great things for Bison. The biggest thing is positioning you dont want to be so close to where they can jump over you but not so far away to where they can walk out. Find that sweet spot like I mentioned above. As far as general pressure mix ups go far since you cant use overheads. So things like tick throws CC baits and frame traps with nightmare axe or the like will keep your opponent guessing.    If you havent already noticed Bison thrives on getting in your opponents head ,StreetFighter,da4qbow,3,t5_2qnu5
9667654,0,t3_5dds9h,I honestly feel like people do it just to spite people who play other characters they arent willing to play. I had a guy legit ragequit on me and tell me he hated Rashid.

I feel like for some people losing to Rashid is like one of the worst things that can happen to them while trying to preserve the rank they have.The only time I ever pulled the ethernet cable was when I literally cant tell what is happening on screen nothing but teleporting and us on both ends of the screen.

After buying a PC and left consoles behind I lost touch with all that happened with rd strike and a little bit of SF but I bought an arcade stick for shmups and fighting games and decided to check SFV. It definitely lacks compared to its predecessors but my craving for a Street Fighter game is strong enough to not let things piss me off.

Not too long ago I kept getting matched against a Rashid that did nothing but jump backwards and Eagle Spike all game every game. He took  games off me then never took even one round. But he kept doing it! It was boring as hell but that doesnt warrant raging at him. Thats just how the guy played. I imagine it worked like a charm against everyone he was getting matched against everyone but me.If your playstyle is turtling then more power to you its on the opponent to crack open that shell. Half the game is getting into your opponents head and figuring out what theyre doing after all. Not to mention charge characters crouch block. Thats kinda their whole gimmick. Overheads exist jumpins exist.If you need a sparring partner my CFN is Motionised. Ive played a bit of Balrog myself might be able to help you out if the latency isnt too bad. I live in Western EuropeOne cool little combo you can practise is j.HK gt cr.HP gt h.Screw Smash Down charge Up  HK itll take some practise to get the charge right but youre looking at something damage and  stun in only three hits! Absolutely nasty you can even combo into EX Dash Straight afterwards! Thats a rough link though I still cant do it consistantly.,StreetFighter,dal4nld,5,t5_2qnu5

9846916,1,t1_dar2qqk,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,StreetFighter,dar2qu7,4,t5_2qnu5

Very few characters have a way to continue pressure after finishing a string.  You either have to jump or dash or do some other slow move.  The characters that did have one CammyChun are getting nerfed.  If you have the option to keep pressure up you generally take it.   The reward for pressuring is increased opportunity to score hits.

You play someone that is also in placement and lose to them then it also stores this variable. You beat someone so bad you get a double perfect thats stored etc etc. This is all then taken into consideration for when the system places you into your rank. Usually its within what you usually play at but like most things its not an exact science.Its a really common system for just about any game with a serious online laddermatchmaking.

9969465,0,t3_5i5v0v,Im not sure what there really is to say. Its a hard game for most people and that by its nature is going to drive away most casual people. Casual people are  because there are more of them than the hardcore. But its been like this since the beginning so Im not sure what the surprise is.SF has always been a series about investment. You have to be willing to lose many many games to learn what you are doing wrong. You have to spend hours in training mode to be able to do basic things such as fireballs SRKs or tatsus. You have to lose dozens of games and try everything to figure out how to beat certain techniques such as crossups and so on.Smash has accessibility. It has  player play. It has fun characters from all of Nintendos franchises. The moves in the game are as easy as press a direction and a button.I thought  was a great direction for the series and it didnt draw me in because it was easy or anything but that it was a challenge. I spent a lot of time figuring out my character the best punishes etc. But then again I do like challenging games Dark Souls Resident Evil Remake Alien Isolation Natural Selection  Starcraft etc.I think the bigger thing to look at is that the culture of today really is one of instant gratification. I mean back then you had to wait for your favorite shows to be on at a certain time of night. Now you just flip on your Ipad and watch something on Netflix. Games like LoL Overwatch and Smash embody this. Its very much like cotton candy that you just eat until pink shit comes out of your ass. Street Fighter is a hard game. Its not a game you just whip out to play with your autistic cousin its a game you buy strategy guides for a game where you look up frame data for a game where you buy a fightstick for. The people that grow to like SF are people who are willing to put their time into learning a difficult game rather than walking away after one loss. Games like SF appeal to a certain type of gamer that isnt as common as ones that are casual.Im not sure what they should do. Maybe doing the freetoplay system could draw in people that would otherwise pass on the game. You could rotate characters each week so people wont just stick to one and would be more incentivized to buy one for .,StreetFighter,db71qe2,1,t5_2qnu5

9976854,0,t1_db7n4gc,Youre supereager to go in and thatll work against a lot of people but the more experienced players will know to sit back and let your moves work against you. Have you watched how Justin plays Karin? Because though I dont think you should copy him exactly you might want to try taking a few pages out of his book as far as using Karins really strong normals for zoning to slow down the pace and give yourself another speed in the match. Standing MK is insanely strong for zoning and slowing down the pace.Floe started looking really hungry because he knew you were being overaggressive and if he had a character he knew better he could capitalize on it much better than he did. He did good for what little he knew though. When he jumped in it was at a range where he could safely assume youd be whiffing pretty much any of your goto moves and he could hit you and create an opening.Your aggression is good but you need to consider your spacing for when youre doing it because more experienced players will know to just sit back and block and then find that sweet spot spacingwise and jump in and punish you....or just otherwise wait for you to hang yourself. You need to learn effective spacing for whiffing your normals ie you can fully whiff without being punished and how to slow down the pace to control players who just answer you by backing off and waiting for you to mess up.For Game  divide up the screen into  space and watch how many times Floe settles into space  jumps or jumps in and youre whiffing a normal in space  or trying to approach with an attack thats about to get stuffed by the neutral jump attack. Floe says it himself at one point  keep doing forward skjslksj so I can neutral jump all dayYou need to learn to control the farther spacing better and learn to slow down your tempo. Those were the two things that Floe basically used to hang you....that and you almost never would go for throw tech or otherwise dodging the throw which gave him some free damage here and there.edit also I wouldnt say you got wrecked by floe. He definitely gave you a free lesson though. Hes even giving you tips if you just listen to what hes saying and not just taking it as trash talk.,StreetFighter,db80fy0,6,t5_2qnu5

10008220,0,t3_5ixmyx,Learn the value in doing nothing taking no action.Learn how your opponents basic movements give away his intentions.  Example  my opponent is trying to close space by walking forward so I fireball him to keep him out.  Next time instead of walking forward hes just teetering back and forth at a specific spacing without advancing or retreating aka obviously looking for a fireball to jump over.  Bait the jump and DP.So in the example my recognition of my opponents basic movement allowed me to infer his intentions and act accordingly.Doing nothing allows you to observe your opponent like this.  Longer you observe more data you have better reads you get.Doing nothing is exceptionally powerful yet very misunderstood by a new player.

It seems a bit simple but balancing around VSkill might just be what adds the most depth to the game this season.VSkills if central to each character really highlight their strengths playstyle and primary resources.For example given focus on vskill You could infer that Nash is reliant on VMeter both trigger and reversal and would excel at biding his time at range before spending meter for pressure and gap closing.Zangiefs VSkill implies that sacrificing health for space control is an emphasis and focuses his play on moving forward. Lauras VSkill indicates a mobile mixup playstyle but doesnt really address her meterhealth management.I think a character felt flat when their VSkill was only a nichelinear option so increasing their prevalence could really help counter complaints that every character plays similarly.,StreetFighter,dbctt85,33,t5_2qnu5

10091814,0,t3_5kauex,Footsies is the Key term here. There is MUCH more to neuteal than just having good buttonsits about reading and analyzing the opponent in neutral which buttons do they press at which timings. How do the respond to you walking backforward and your buttons. This requires also having a good understanding of spacing so you can bait the opponent into pressing buttons you WANT them to press so you can whiff punish preemptively poke them out of it make it whiff for surprise dash. If they buffer normals into specials walk forward into their max range and hold downback so they cancel on block. If they are now afraid to press buttons you get free dash up attemps or just simply walk forward more. Regarding baiting normals against slower normals after luring them to use those you can go for jumps which they either have to block or you potentially punisb their normal.Making someone focus on ground game will leave gaps in their anti aiiring or vulnerable to dashups if they look to counterpoke. Lastly if you have the lifelead there is little reason to take big risks suchas jumping dashing or using big normals or even walking a whole lot.Footsies is really dynamic but its the thing that will make you a better player because you constantly try to analyze and think gathering info through the rounds and using their strenghts and weaknesses agaisnt them this isnt some some vague shit you do when playing the game its real and top players do it constantly.Akuma his projectile isnt a normal attack but it is a strong horizontal space control tool it enforces his existing normal attacks combined with his walkspeed he has a strong neutral eventhough his normals are stubby. Do not underestimate the importance  of a good walkspeed especially backwards as it allows you to walk in and outside of the opponent their ranges. It makes it easier to bait a reaction.Anyway look up some Sakonoko Daigo Momochi Tokido Ricki Justin Alex Valle gameplay footage and watch their neutral with the things i mentioned above. Can be SFV USFIV etcSonicHurricane also has a footsie handbook you might find enlightening. ,StreetFighter,dbmza0b,2,t5_2qnu5

10123680,0,t1_dbr441t,I mentioned earlier that he didnt seem to do as much damage as sfiv akuma when compared to the cast but now that i think on it that could be because of vtrigger.in vtrigger akumas DP turns into a heavy goshoryu into...er...misogi? its a brutal attack that slams the opponents head down and all his fireballs become twohit knockdown fireballs that hit like a truck.I like to think that vtrigger akuma is the scarier version and truer to the Higher damage character we know and love. the problem with this is once in vtrigger youre locked into vtriggered attacks for the duration meaning you cant do halfscreen fireball to fool an opponent into mistiming their attack based on your recovery your air fireballs are all basically the same double air fireball that covers two spaces and your shoryuken is the same across the board albeit with vastly better range and its basically just a good antiair all around in vtrigger. whether or not this limits your options or effectively covers them all? i dunno.,StreetFighter,dbr4eih,1,t5_2qnu5

10179294,0,t3_5lrfpj,gtMy main issues are wake up stuff and knowing when to go from defense to offense.I think this just comes with time and knowledge of frame data. Youll essentially switch to defense when its your opponents turn to attack because youve pressed a button that gives them the advantage over any of your moves due to the length of the recovery frames of that button. Its also generally wise to be defensive on your wakeup although in some cases your opponent may back off instead of applying pressure or their pressure may not be real and can therefore be jabbed out of.gtI was led to believe the MP shoryuken has invincibility frames. Is this wrong? What am I missing here? MP shoryuken was invincible on the first frame in season . That is no longer the case in season . It is still invincible at some point the third frame I believe but that makes it useless as a reversal unless you think your opponent wont have time to hit you with a meaty on your wakeup.That being said EX shoryukens are invincible on the first frame so youll have to spend a third of your meter if you really want the opponent off of you.gtThe second problem with wakeups is escaping special grabs Im completely clueless as to what to do against lauramikazangief because I cant tech out of their grabs I think. How best to deal with these charactersspecial throws?Jump or backdash. Backdashing will get you crushcountered if your opponent decides to hit you with a hardbutton but you recover faster. Jumping is slower but usually guarantees you more damage if you can land a combo on the way down. Id recommend jumping. gtThe issue with defense is that even though the enemy is doing something predictable and I can block it Im finding it hard to punish them for it. Im not talking about huge openings from enemy uppercuts more along the lines of HKs and HPs at the end of enemy combos.If the opponent is close enough you can punish any blocked sweep with your own if youre playing Ryu. The recovery frames for hard punches vary though. Some are safe and some arent.,StreetFighter,dbxvnpr,1,t5_2qnu5

10265279,0,t1_dc77u52,It might be true that Capcom nerfed some strategies that are too abusable at lower competition levels Nashs MK scythe but I believe their primary purpose is to make the competitive scene appear as varied and interesting as possible by buffing the most interesting and unique characters Dhalsim Zangief Guile Ibuki etc. so that when you tune in on an important tournament on twitch you wont always see the same boring stuff.Character variety in season one wasnt too bad numerically around  characters at the top well represented in every tournament but too many of them had a similar playstyle while the unique characters were all low tier.,StreetFighter,dc7mis5,2,t5_2qnu5

Stubbyesque normals perhaps but hes got a fireball to help with that.As the Alex match up goes if either gets going it can be bad for either Alexs wake up is damn near free if you make the right guesses so thats good for Akuma but if Akuma screws up he can eat a CC Vtrigger combo for a rd his health more if including resets.

10271358,0,t3_5n2wkj,Ive done some online touraments for different games and also worked at junior sporting events which is similar and what id say is you need to be strict but fair.You need to have a clear ruling because people will enter and not show up. They will disappear on you and you dont want to be roaming the convention hall trying to find them. Only to have them run in on you  secs after youve decided to close and hand a bye to there opponent.How are you contacting players? Think about how you are letting them know when they are being marshalled for a game think about the policy you have in place. Because the flipside is speakers are inaudible in loud places. people go to the bathroom for mins and miss a callout. You cant be shouting out once and then blaming them. Thats not really fair.Also idk about others but being a TO is a pretty thankless job at times. You kinda have to love getting a tournament through to completion but not in the games of the tournament itself. One time in a Tetris tournament its a thing I gave a loss to the  ranked player in the field because of his behaviour towards another TO. As long as you have a ruleset and it is understood by the other TOs and the players. Everything should be fine. As Sun Tzu says If words of command are not clear and distinct if orders are not thoroughly understood then the general is to blame. But if orders are clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey then it is the fault of their oficers.,StreetFighter,dc8bc90,2,t5_2qnu5

10281554,0,t1_dc9g5ps,I said most of his tools. His charge moves lose to it flat out the stun gun stomp and elbow. Command grab obviously ditto. HK as well as well as many other slow moves depending on the circumstances... Thats quite a lot. Of course regular buttons beat a neutral jump... but were saying many of his tools more like gimmicks in his case lose to it. So if you neutral jump a lot your opponent will be forced to adapt by not using ANY of Alex special moves and some buttons as well leaving them with a shitty slow character with O.K buttons.The risk is also almost nonexistent... Alex cant really do much about neutral jumps from a distance its only at point blank that you can do something about it.,StreetFighter,dc9gy56,3,t5_2qnu5

It also doesnt have EX moves it has crit moves instead which arent based on meter usage.  What? NO. Combos are hard AF due to LOWER hitstun. WTF are crit moves  you mean the random stun?  gtAlpha plays different than    and . Alpha is known for being almost as fast as  but being the one to introduce EX moves. It also was the first to add selectable moves at character select Vmove Amove etc.  What? NO. There are no EX moves in Alpha and you dont select your moves at character select  you select your ISM style of supers. Alpha  are much MUCH faster than SF.  gt  plays different than  alpha  and .  had parries and a varying super bars depending on what super you chose.  was also noticeably slower than previous street fighter games.  What? NO.  is faster than literally any Street Fighter game before or since. Have you never seen Kokujin vs J rhetorical question I know you havent  gt plays different than  alpha  and . It was the first to introduce a revenge meter in the form of ultras it had focus attacks and the dash cancel to those focus attacks. It is also the slowest and most methodical of street fighters.  Vortex Fighter  is slow. Riiiiiight.  gt plays different than  alpha  and .  removed selectable moves it added crush counters and is faster than the previous  street fighter games. Its revenge meter also behaves more like Killer Instinct instinct meter than s Ultra bar being distinct for every character on how it builds and what it does.   SF is not faster than SF. Just. NO. Its not.  gtThe only universal element in every street fighter game is the inputs and those even change a bit for each installment. qcf qcb charge moves hcfhcb command grabs full circle command grabs  buttons  ex double input  super.   buttons in Alpha  is throw.tldr utheswerto is wrong and doesnt know whats what,StreetFighter,dcbv5tu,6,t5_2qnu5

Lots of other people have and are using it and are improving quite a bit because of it  On top of this I assume you want someone with an active hand in helping you learn. Im down for that too. How often you want to have training days is up to you Im available almost every day. I wont give you stuff to learn or advice that doesnt apply to your rank so the idea is that youll gradually learn things and get better. How fast you improve is up to you.

10358410,0,t1_dchzj18,yes there is also the possibilty you mis timed something. you can use that link i gave you to figure out after you knock someone down with a move how you can easily do a frame perfect setup every timefor example with birdie I knock them down with a CC sweep i do DFHP the penguin slide to kill  frames and then I do the overhead Fhk right away and that will line up the perfect timing for me to hit that move meaty last active frame of the move on their wakeup. when you get into back roll and quick rise you have to incorporate a lot more into making a frame perfect setup because there are  different outcomes quick rise back rise and delayed stand although you can cover   delayed stand always through even more complicated setups whiffing more moves after the first setup has been completed and you identify they are still down when you hit last active frame of a move you gain extra frame advantage for each active frame by  because the amount of hit stun remains unchnaged so you have more frames availalbe to combo to an additional move because yo uexit recovery sooner.,StreetFighter,dci6pz5,1,t5_2qnu5

10401487,0,t3_5oy3w5,I play this matchup a lot and get destroyed because my friend is ultra plat and Im a mere ultra silver.  Im not sure what kind of level youre at but most Bisons who know their data are only going to be confirming into safe specials properly spaced scissors and blasts which means you really need to observe his buttons.  Be aware that post special it is always your turn as he is negative after all of them except EX which resets to neutral.First off if you can react to dashes you have a huge advantage in this matchup.  If you cant the second best option is neutral jumps.  Neutral jumps counter scissors they counter his shadow axe DFHP they counter his dash which are really the only  options he can ever get in on you with since his walkspeed is so terrible.  You can also just watch for DF.HP and crush counter it with good timing but thats risky unless youve practiced it in the lab my friend seems to do that to me about  of the time when Im being too predictable.Otherwise you just gotta know his buttons once he is in.  Never ever challenge the HK knee unless he is just spamming back to back knees as its  and his cr. mp standard confirm is f which means if you press a light you are getting counterhit into real damage.  Invincible reversal beats all his options of course.  DFHP is also only   if you notice he always does DFHPgtDFHP or DFHPgtcr mp you can just jab him  cr. mp will always get checked by a jab.  However now that Bison has a f normal he can do DFHPgtstanding short so you really need to observe and see if he is checking you with the standing lk.   Many Bisons online mindlessly do DFHPgtcr.mp as that is the standard confirm combo.If Bison is keeping his distance it means hes really limiting himself to his  tools to get in and you just need to be aware of those Dash Scissors DF HP.  Random neutral jumps can really mess up all  although his last option is spending meter to get in with ex devils reverse.  If Bison is doing that alot to get in just be aware it costs him meter  he wants you to block it so the best option is jumpbackgtyour fastest upwards hitting attack.  This will often trade or beat EX reverse and it means you dont have to eat the  mixup he gets when you block the reverse on the ground.Once you finally get in on Bison his only defensive options are vreversal and his f so if your meaties are tight there is very little Bison can do to stop pressure.  Be aware that S gave him an invincible reversal in vtrigger with EX headstomp but its now negative on block and its actually not invincible after he reappears for the headstomp meaning you can use reversal on it or simply block it for a light punish I think its  so if you have a medium that is f you could get a decent punish.,StreetFighter,dcn2q0p,4,t5_2qnu5

10446603,0,t3_5plyns,At the level youre at now I would say the three things you need to work on  most are teleporting following through after a hit and sliding.Insta air teleports are tricky at first but pretty necessary to Dhalsims game.  Teleporting out of his float is great for certain things but it doesnt allow for strong offensive pressure.  For that you need to be doing it as quick as possible and often with a fireball.You landed a lot of hits.  You could have closed out those matches pretty quickly if you followed through with combos more.  Get used to hit confirming and learning block strings.Sliding is very unsafe unless you do it at the ideal distance.  Better players will destroy you if you went for those many short ranged slides.  Youll do better with all slides if you use them after a setup for spacing.  Otherwise theyre best for navigating and punishing.You have more patience than most players in your league do.  It pays off big time with how many openings you get so now its time to capitalize on those openings.  You seem comfortable playing keep away reacting to things and not being overly aggressive.  This is a very good sign for things in your future because Dhalsim requires that mindset the most and its easier said than done.There are tons of specific things I could point out but if you just take these things into account I think you could advance a nice chunk.    ,StreetFighter,dcs7keq,4,t5_2qnu5

You just have to recognize the opponents block strings and be on top of your throw breaks.  VReversal will work but only against heavy attacks or if they are pressing buttons nonstop.  The issue with Alexs VReversal is can be easily baited out with a light attack and then they can throw you out of the kick he does.  Alex requires a lot of work and a great deal of that is his awful defensive options.  He is a steamroller that is only even decent at a being a steamroller.,StreetFighter,dd6ymxh,1,t5_2qnu5

10599609,0,t3_5roco4,Stories are what make watching and playing competitive games whether we are talking about video games sports or even just playing board games with the family so much fun. Take a look at baseball.  years ago the playoffs were drawing in massive amounts of viewers to see the Red Sox and Yankees play each other because everybody wanted to see how the story of those two massive franchises would continue. I personally believe stories or lack thereof are part of the reason why Street Fighter viewership was down last year compared to the final year of Ultras life cycle.For myself when I saw KBrad and Wolfkrone walk on stage at FF I felt that tingle of anticipation deep in my belly. I knew something awesome was going to happen no matter who won and that made it incredibly exciting to watch. More exciting than any other match all weekend. Because I wanted to see how their story continued. And I know I will be just as excited if not even more the next time they play each other.So dont ban teabagging. It is a way players express themselves and their stories which is what the FGC needs.,StreetFighter,dd99o5a,2,t5_2qnu5

10644039,0,t1_dddsc3f,Actually I am happy that SFV came out cause I am not a big fan of USFs gameplay. If you read closely I dont even complain about the gameplay in SFV. The fact that capcomdimpssony whoever is responsible did such a lazy job on SFV is what boggles my mind. This is not hate I just objectively observe what they did here. Loading times this long are not acceptable! I measured my time in game and in loading screensmenus. I played h of ranked but actual playtime was less than  min. So more than half my time is lost waiting and looking at loading screens Im on a fast PC with SSD btw. Maybe young fellas can deal with that but I got very limited time to spend with video games. How come other fighting games dont load such a long time? Are those programmed by wizards? No! They are done by small ass developer crews like lab zero skullgirls or team red guilty gear who got much less financial power and sales than capcom. Regarding USFs death you can not compare this to melee cause that scene had no official CPT done by nintendo or anything like that. We all know that if they still had USF in CPT people would play it. But that is not what they want because they need to sell SFV now. They forced the transition it did not come naturally. Melee is also from a time where games did not have online updates or anything like that. This means the game never got any changes and people still play the same version today not the case with SF.,StreetFighter,dddun7f,1,t5_2qnu5

10778564,0,t1_ddr0g5g,Agreed. Before any kind of gameplay change Capcom should REALLY make sure the game actually works. One of the main reasons I dont play that game that much is exactly because of that. My gaming sessions are limited to about one hour and one hour on SFV is absolutely nothing since you spend about half of your time waiting for games. Battle lounges are janky we still cant see the flagsconnection and I still randomly get disconnections midset in battle lounges. Connection indicators are freaking bs. Accept a ranked match with supposedly  bars realize its actually a guy living on the other side of the Atlantic. Seriously?For the love of God Capcom fix this. Give me a game with acceptable loading times better matchmaking times and working servers so I can actually focus on playing the damn game because every single session I have on SFV makes me feel like SFV just doesnt want me to play.,StreetFighter,ddrqbg8,2,t5_2qnu5

10792074,0,t3_5ucwuf,i really like the character so far but i dont understand the logic behind her v trigger if the freeze goes away once she gets hit how is it any different from a regular stun bar? much like the regular stun bar without being frozen it will not go down as long as you hit your opponent and it will go down as soon as you start getting hit adding freeze on top of it only helps in case you want to get away which you will almost never want and even if you do afterwards you need to play perfectly to keep it up since it goes away from any hit,StreetFighter,ddt4k22,4,t5_2qnu5
10792711,0,t1_ddsoaw1,Yeah thats kinda the point in SFIV and honestly a lot of other fighting games you fight a skill variety and usually you can outplay people by just knowing that little bit more. But in SFV even mid to low level players give you a hard time just by doing crazy stuff that is often hard to punish and then you lose and feel like crap.

The single biggest positive change that can be made is if a vreversal connects whoever used the vreversal gets all their grey health turned back into green health.  ESPECIALLY now that grey health recovery is basically nonexistent.  Would bring balance back to the game as defensive reads would have more impact and really makes someone think about HOW they build and keep grey health on their opponent.

Im starting to hate everything about the game the lame playstyle people use to cheese throw loops certain chars have an op crush counters where when youre getting up if you press anything  itll get beat. spamming moves over and over because regardless its faster than most moves you can do i.e. Cammys crouch mid punch how theres some jump ins where you have to deny logic and guard a different direction because somehow they teleport behind you or when youve gotten use to thoses weird jumps some times randomly the game doesnt put they behind you so you get hit. How much of a grind it is to get fight money after the start most games with a currency system let you earn good amounts but have lots of options of what to buy instead of overpriced slim pickings. How everything ultimately feels the same because some moves are just so unsafe unless exd that you dont do them instead you play nash or someone like a youtuberpro because any other way is just too unsafe.,StreetFighter,de58x2y,1,t5_2qnu5

He has moderately fast walk speed long range fireballs and the best fucking invincible reversal in the game. Birdies greatest strength by far is his high damaging combos and he gives up speed long range zoning a proper wake up game and has an jump arc that makes it too easy to anti air his jump ins for that. Fact of the matter is that Urien is slightly better than Birdie in what Birdie does best while having little to none of those weak areas thats a problem.

The game design which I disagree with if true was to make whiff punishing harder so people are incentivised to fish for counters rather than fish for whiff punishes so low forward is less powerful of a tool than it used to be. Further incentivisation comes in the form of the normal priority system when two hitboxes go active on the same frame and would trade normally mediums beat lights and heavies beat both and the crush counter system.,StreetFighter,deksoo4,6,t5_2qnu5

Karin is fun dont get me wrong. But I jabbed people out of the air or was able to use hp for a trade most of the time. Execution I think Karin is a little easier mainly cause her combos are less long input wise. That being said the point of playing a game is to have fun.

11208103,0,t3_5ztkqr,A lot of pros overreact because she was just SO GOOD in S and was overnerfed in S. Capcom did right to give her particular attention as she was too strong in S but they went a little overboard with nerfs in two key areas pressure and damage.PressureThe biggest nerf to Chun can be summed up in three words Instantair legs IAL. The advantage she got in S when doing IAL even on block was incredible and gave her a good way to maintain pressure against a flustered opponent. Her antiair s.LK was tremendously nerfed while Necallis and Juris jabs somehow stayed entirely intact...? and it now trades with or is beaten by most jumpins. In S it gave her a free mixup with the potential to switch sides and meaty. Now in S she has to rely on bHK which is inconsistent is slow and hits the opponent too far away to provide any sort of mixup.Finally her s.HP and c.LP were slowed down giving her fewer good fast poke options with c.LP leading into several fantastic breadandbutters. And her Kikoken was also slowed albeit not by much.Honestly these changes were enough to lower her from toptier status into mid tier or high tier at best but WAIT THERES MOREDamageWith a few exceptions coughLAURAcoughBALROGcough everyone in S got decently significant damage nerfs  but I think they hit ChunLi and her multihitting attacks more significantly than some others.All versions of Lightning Legs and Spinning Bird Kick were reduced by  damage and since these are her mainonly? comboenders this hit her hard. Plus her VTrigger  where she was truly scary  was shortened by a CONSIDERABLE amount further hurting her damagedealing game.In conclusion and sorry for the novel shes not abysmal now but she has some real problems competing with the big dogs when all she really has is pokes. She was just too good in S and Capcom overcompensated in key areas without giving her any real buffs to balance it out. Sure she can cancel legs into VTrigger but with scaling and damage reductions all around this doesnt solve any problem.With Season . patch notes released everyone is reacting because they gave her nothing else to compensate for these nerfs so shes likely to remain weak for a while. It just feels like a rehash of her treatment in SF. I think thats frustrating a lot of people.,StreetFighter,df2fbyb,2,t5_2qnu5

11261315,0,t1_df8fya4,Dash or drill are punishable but you dont need to do that. Walk towards them. The way the game works is that eventually to stop you from walking right next to them they have to press a button or do something. Your goal is to figure out when and where they will press a button and counter it by either pressing your own button to hit their button jumping over and hitting them as they recover or just waiting a bit until you can figure out a good time to do one of the above.If they jump towards thats when you antiair. If they jump back follow them until they have no place further to go.If they keep throwing fireballs you need to be patient and find the right moment to jump over one and do a combo on them. Dont try to jump over every fireball but dont not jump either. You need to try to establish just how longat what distances theyre going to keep throwing them. You can also ex drill through them.,StreetFighter,df8gbzw,4,t5_2qnu5
11262262,0,t1_df8fya4,EX divekick is not very punishable and if spaced properly Im pretty sure its completely safe on block. And hes saying to use EX Drill to punish fireballs which if youre punishing on reaction it theoretically should always connect. You can also punish fireballs full screen with super on reaction so practice that for sure.Playing Cammy is very tough in Bronze I started out as a Cammy main for the exact reasons youre saying. People know that you dont have an overhead and that a lot of the time bronze Cammys will eventually get frustrated and start throwing out random spiral arrows and essentially just throw the match away. Your dive kick is a really really important tool in the neutral because it lets you jump toward them without committing to the full jump animation watch some higher level cammy players and see how they use it. At certain ranges you can even bait an antiair DP that will whiff because your jump was cut short. Otherwise just be patient and like Gentlemad said let them walk themselves into the corner and use that to your advantage. Good luck!EDIT Another thing that almost nobody in Bronze does once you have a lifelead you no longer have to worry about your opponent playing defensive because if they want to win the round they now HAVE to try to start an offense of some kind.

11278266,0,t1_dfaconf,or you can also view it entirely differently in that OSes arent inherently a negative thing for games. just look at guilty gear arguably aside from yrc OS which is very difficult to defend really most OSes in that game have strong weaknesses that can also be exploited if aware and as such it only enriches the game in reality.this is part of the nuanced mindgames that come at higher level play largely due to their technical understanding and is generally only present in layered depth when theres also the presence of a higher technical skill ceiling.and yes im almost always rude to people who consistently make replies that are completely irrelevant to the points i raised or issues i addressed. i wasnt rude the first time but when i had to make a second post to tell you to read my name and compare with the guy you were talking to i couldnt restrain myself which granted is a flaw of mine.and again i dont think you really understand this issue as much as you think you do otherwise you wouldnt have said sfv is a game where OSes are irrelevant when were discussing how this is impacted by fundamental design decisions. its a terrible example specifically because the developer has actively gone in to remove OSes that were present from their design so OSes arent irrelevant in sfv in any large part due to design decisions but theyre continuously addressed. but additionally this last approach of directly addressing OSes is also something that could be a potential solution to this issue it just enforces a lot of work and QA stuff on top of continuous monitoring during an extended and preferably largevolume trial.so again these consequences of adding buffers also have solutions if you simply consider it. i really think your view of game design seems far too rigid to really be discussing it with such imagined authority on the subject.,StreetFighter,dfadidb,1,t5_2qnu5

11318607,0,t1_dfexoel,Hah you know your last sentence is the reason I made the video. I never said these are perfect options that will always work guaranteed. But you seem to have common sense so I hope you get that already. Theyre combos which are worth knowing about so you can make the conversion as and when the situation arises. Truthfully Ive always thought the stMP gt stMK combo is actually quite obtuse the spacing is always messed up and the combo timing is tricky but I still demonstrate it to show that its possible. Which is why I mixed in additional combos such as the far stHP gt crMK gt EX Fuha combo cause thats good for confirming when you see counterhit from a distance. And ultimately I tend to find counterhits in frame traps and against impatient opponents who press something on wakeup or when its not their turn. So yeah as you came to the conclusion yourself this vid is to give examples of how to convert from counterhits. So I appreciate the feedback and thanks for watching. ,StreetFighter,dfey1l1,1,t5_2qnu5
11319714,0,t3_61j70f,SFV has taken away nearly all defensive options as well as buffed offensive play styles. And without defensive options many times simply jumping or spending one bar is an easy way to skip the neutral game and get right into your opponents face. This is where all the s and rockpaperscissors happens. You MUST guess the mixups correctly because all you have no options to save you. Block or tech or dp its your call and you probably have to guess again repeatedly and back to back depending on the situation. Damage is heavy so a single mixup can mean half your life or stun.In the past you could parry focusattackdashcancel spam light dp or space  and zone with your projectiles or long pokes. Parry isnt universal anymore. Focus attacks are gone. Good pokes are much less common. Blocked Dps are now very easy to punish. The safest way to deal with offence is to predict and preemptively poke BEFORE your opponent gets in. But its way easier to just go on the offensive yourself. The best defence is a good offence is the dominant way to play any character in sfv.,StreetFighter,dff2jxa,10,t5_2qnu5

To me playing sfv for a while even after having a losing streak its nice to close the application sit down and read or just listen to music and think about what can you do better next and sometimes have awareness of the moves that you try to do didnt work. Having your own self awareness can lead a good path. I just lost to a Diamond Rashid today and I try to do something but it seems he read every single move i try to do. Alex players are risky but I think he knows that so perhaps he used that to hisher advantage.

For hardware posts and questions we have a weekly thread called Weekly Hardware Discussion on SundayMondays depending on time zone. This thread would be a good place for hardware related questions and posts.You might also try posting over on rFighters. Their subreddit allows hardware related posts and many of their users have the knowledge required to answer hardware related questions.I know this can sometimes be a trivial difference but we are trying to stick to the spirit of Street Fighter on the subreddit.

11519394,0,t3_643tvf,To me the redesign of Juri makes no sense. In sf storing to zone makes sense since she was such a good zoner and able to keep people out effectively. But in sfv they give her storing specials which are meant to be used offensively. Which is crazy. So what ends up happening is u go in or get a knock down and use a  of ur stored moves. Now you either keep pressure up with a slightly gimped character or back off and reload you specials. U cnt maintain pressure with this character like everyone else. I wouldnt no how to fix her. I personally prefer hee sf zoning version.,StreetFighter,dg1q3um,1,t5_2qnu5

11526115,0,t3_6437c9,The idea with grapplers is that you want to condition your opponent to block before going for command throws because they are very punishable when the read you and neutral jump.I usually go in with a lot of normal hits first and when they start to block a lot I start going for command grabs.You should definitely look into frame traps if you havent already. I feel a big part of Mikas game is getting close and making them guess between tick command throw and frame trap.On another note her Punch command grab has a lot more range specifically the EX version followed by the light version. I personally only go for those two just to be safe.Her Kick command throw has a lot less range same applies here EX and light version have the best range but still The EX K grab has less range than the Heavy P grab. So use it only when you are right in their face.The big advantage this K grab has over the P grab is that you can dash in and get a meaty hitgrab mixup so if you feel you are in range for the K grab you should always go for that one.And another thing I feel is really important and I only started doing this myself in the past few months. Is mixing up your command grabs with normals throws.When they read your command grab and neutral jump they get a bigass jumpin combo on you and that is A LOT of damage but if you normal throw and they neutral jump you have enough time to anti air them with c.MP and then you get another mixup on them when they land from getting hit out of the air.I feel the biggest challenge with R. Mika is getting close enough I personally jump A LOT wich is not something I would recomend to anyone but it works for me and I often dont feel like a have any other choice because her neutral game is just so bad.I just try not to be too predictable with the jumps go for crossups when possible. And if they anti air consistently try to play neutral for a while until they have their focus shifted away from the air and try to surprise them with the jump or just play passive block and wait for an opportunity to punish an unsafe move and take back the offense.Rolling in and Charged HK are both options but both can be easily punished by good players with fast reactions.

11548193,0,t3_64qpr1,A throw mixup isnt a true . You have to mix up at least three different options to make it work meaty normal meaty throw delay throw bait to catch late tech and all those options can be potentially interrupted and result in damage on the attacker. For example most throw attempts that dont have a perfect setup AND most late throw attempts will be beaten by a reversal jab. Blocking beats both a meaty attempt and a throw bait. Its entirely possible inevitable even for the attacking player to mix themselves up doing this and take damage.,StreetFighter,dg4znvm,1,t5_2qnu5
