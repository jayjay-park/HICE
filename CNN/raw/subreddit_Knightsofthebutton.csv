3580705,0,t3_31czl1,More important right now sir is that we have knights scedualed to die when it hits thirty now which would almost surely be worthless as opportunists and impulsives will keep it going according to mathematic estimates for  days.

3600853,0,t1_cq2pxpx,Its an admirable point of view but ultimately I just want the button to stay alive for as long as it can. If technology can help us achieve that goal then we should do it.Otherwise I fear a small slipup will let the timer hit zero while there are still hundreds of willing and able knights.

3682997,0,t3_32hosa,Im not sure how I feel about this. I like changing it to all autoclick but I liked the roundrobin system of the old where it assigns a person to autoclick rather than having multiple people have their autoclicker autoclick at a different time It seems troublesome to me.

4005941,0,t1_crcmg8a,Any time added to the button is time that we wouldnt have had. He extended the life of the button by s. In a best case scenario  weeks later he extends the button by s by clicking at s when the button is dying. This of course is assuming hes going to follow the button for  weeks. If he moved on and forgot about it the button dies without his click and we lose s. So yes OP You did a good job.,Knightsofthebutton,crcwovd,5,t5_37niy
