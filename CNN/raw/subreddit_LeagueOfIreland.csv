3844845,0,t1_cquiy74,Fair enough but for a player like Richie Towell per se whos turning  and wont be eligible for FAI youth squads soon I think it would be beneficial. I dont think loi clubs would mind that much. English clubs yes i could see getting pissed off but think of it this way  friendlies a year at the uttermost more realistically  none of them scheduled during the championship or FL playoffs last few games I think the FAI would work something out. And especially since they used a lot of loi stadiums if they continue to and bring in k fans theyll be generating good money for clubs.,LeagueOfIreland,cqujoea,2,t5_2s7h8

5637514,0,t1_cwvfpzr,gtCork City have lost leagues in both Dundalk and Drogheda and both times the local fans made a beeline for our fans to taunt and throw stuff at us as if this was the first thing they thought of doing having just won a league. Youre making it sound like every single fan went out of their way to taunt the Cork fans. You know rightly that EVERY SINGLE TEAM in this country have a cluster of soft headed cretins that disguise themselves as fans that love to cause a ruck no matter the occasion. So please refrain from pinning this on the entire county of Louth thank you very much.gtIts a pity Cromwell didnt finish the job. Aye and were the hateful ones that despise everyone else in the country according to you. Take a look at yourself for fuck sake. Obviously you have some grudge for whatever reason but what are you like saying shit like that. Cop the fuck on.,LeagueOfIreland,cwvvydx,2,t5_2s7h8

8982739,0,t3_539mr5,Ive always been of the point of view that Irish football would benefit if players looked beyond England and Scotland when considering a move. Since most of our footballers and coaches who go abroad  end up in England or Scotland that still of play has become entwined with the national team and goes down to grassroots level. If more Irish players and coaches moved further afield then the UK wed benefit more from that experience back home.,LeagueOfIreland,d7rl5ss,4,t5_2s7h8
