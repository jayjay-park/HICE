6672301,0,t1_d09gxde,Yep Im tracking that data in the aggregate as well.  Right now I havent split it by region or zip but I am just counting the days from Acceptance to Delivered and keeping an internal average of FCM versus PM and PM is currently showing up  days earlier than FCM.Im also counting package scans per shipping type and PM definitely gets more scans per mailing.The data is amazing and its overwhelming me because I keep coming up with more interesting ways to put it out there.I think data hounds are going to go nuts once I actually start showing the data in useful ways.  I am considering doing a weekly recap blog post on vape mail of the past week.,vapemailclub,d09h22v,1,t5_3c5tw
