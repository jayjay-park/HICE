9552974,0,t3_5bo7az,Our version isnt smoothly optimized like CNs is atm. So fps drops are going to be very common. Just make sure to check your cpu usage and restart your game every once and a while to not have any lasting issues. ,revelation_online,d9qlnt3,1,t5_3gqvc

10262994,0,t3_5mj4uy,Take the gui.pg and entities.pg file from your English game and move them over. Make sure to back up the RU ones. This will get you translated until  where you will need to remove them in order to level up.,revelation_online,dc7d6zw,2,t5_3gqvc
11076967,0,t3_5xwv46,I could have sworn this was open beta not launch.  It better not be launch as its still pretty rough in my eyes.  Like others have said so much is still untranslated.  And if we dont get new voiceovers that is really going to turn people away.,revelation_online,denkbjm,2,t5_3gqvc
11093184,0,t3_5xyy69,Dude Ive read through you comments on this post and you really should stop taking the pessimistic approach. Otherwise you are only punishing yourself by playing the game. No game is for everyone. If this game isnt to your liking you can easily stop. Or you can take some time and read. Do those other quests. Ya know the ones that arent story quests. Because there are literally like  other quests types. Purple Blue Orange Green and Guild quests. I havent done a story quest in a few days. Been gathering crafting doing dailies and exploring. The game isnt forcing you to do story. It might encourage you to the story aspect but you dont really have to do it. It seems to only give the game some frame of reference as to why you might do things in a certain area. There are revolving events in a few areas in the world. Like the spiders outside of Misty hollows needs some eradicating.  Or in Bearworld there is a whole slew of events that recycle every hour I think.  Also press the O button and do those EVENTS for special drops. There is so much that they arent telling you to do but is available. The game is new in America and other places that speak english so there arent many comprehensive guides to the game. They only give you like  percent of what you can do in the game.   ,revelation_online,depehvw,3,t5_3gqvc
