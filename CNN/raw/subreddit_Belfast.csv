You will however have to put out around  for a CBT to even ride with L plates. Unless you have an A category on your license that is. And get the beat gear you can afford. And not an open face helmet those things are hellish in rain. ,Belfast,cki74kn,1,t5_2rc51

4549088,0,t3_3dbnfm,As has been said Halloween is a much bigger deal in Derry. Or rather they have a reputation for doing it particularly well.But if you dont fancy travelling up for the night youll still find a few things going on in Belfast even if it does just revolve around getting pissed in a costume. The Black Box generally has an annual Devil Disco which is pretty awesome. Weird music and Bacchanalian revelry.Most bars will have some sort of Halloweeny function going on and there are a couple of local CrampsMisfits cover bands who generally play in some craphole or another thats good fun.If you think outside the box a bit too theres maybe some other fun to be had  maybe a horror flick in the Tudor Cinema or a trip to Crumlin Road Gaol for a ghost tour. Bit touristy but sure.Not many options I know. But if youre up for sticking on a Skull mask chugging a couple of beers and seeing where the wind carries you Im sure youll have a decent enough time.But go to Derry if you can.,Belfast,ct41bph,1,t5_2rc51
