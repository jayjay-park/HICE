6931700,0,t3_4al4av,The trouble is the game had his number. He killed Toriel straight off and then throughout the whole course of the game he spared and killed monsters in a very arbitrary fashion. That is the Vechs we know and love. An arbitrary irascible bastard. He killed em unthinkingly or spared them for trivial reasons.TEM!s are cute and fine dogs are always awesome but he really doesnt give a crap about Moldsmals and various other monsters Moldsmals look like jellyfish or something or mushrooms yet at the end theyre there giving a moral lesson with the other monsters as if they matter just as muchVechs really REALLY didnt like being guilted out over killing Toriel goatmom and was very annoyed at how sympathetic goatdad was made to be but I think the thing he really cant take is being belatedly told that all the monsters he was killing were people.In a sense his surrender and refusal to play any further is indeed its own kind of ending though he sees no path with honor thatll get through the game but he denies that hes violent or arbitrary and blames the game for it so he just goes down fighting and then claims the monsters won. And since he DETERMINES the state of his own copy of the game they do.He can console himself with thoughts of the cuter monsters like Temmie playing free on the grass. And since it wasnt anything like a genocide run theres even a bunch of Moldsmals etc. he didnt just kill because they were in his way.And so passes Vechs The Destroyer repenting grumpily.and never to the end achieving determination. It was the games fault not his.,Vechs,d12180e,4,t5_2vkqq
