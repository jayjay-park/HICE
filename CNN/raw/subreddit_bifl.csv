11630274,0,t3_62w5m8,I can recommend a Braun series   or . Quality goes up along with price. The series  are the highest quality and are actually built in Germany made with great parts. The replacement heads for them are more expensive as well of course.I picked up a series  on clearance at Walmart and Im pretty darn happy with it. I replace the head once a year for between  and  Canadian depending on sale prices.The only thing that I can say would never make it a buy it for life product is that the builtin batteries will eventually become useless.  I dont know if there are workarounds for that or ways to send it in for replacement or anything but I can recommend it as a very good electric shaver.EDIT I realize you were looking for something to trim your beard and not just shave your whole face. This might not be what youre looking for. sorry,bifl,dgeayi4,1,t5_2ta2l
