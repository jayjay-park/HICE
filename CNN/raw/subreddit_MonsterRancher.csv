5593408,0,t1_cwq3mvo,Yeah I agree.  I figured there was a better place to discuss this but this is a good place to get some interest.  Lets plan on meeting up some time next week? So anyone that wants to join can get in on it.  Say next weekend?  Ill look into setting up a BBS forum for us as well.

11359185,0,t1_dfji0hf,I just wanted to let you know that I did watch the entire video before acting.  The only problem was that people reading the topics dont get that context.  Its not fair to require people to view content to not be offended by our subreddit.  You are of course welcome to continue posting videos and content here.  Anyone who wants to create content is a boon to the community IMO.EditDownvotes and upvotes will sort the good and bad content. You dont need my approval mate just keep the titles insult free.  I know you really believe you werent being insulting with the title but obviously some users felt differently fair is fair.  If you were gay youd probably appreciate there no being posts calling a game character a faggot in the title for instance.  I acted based on the reports and messages from those impacted by it not necessarily based on my own stances on these subjects.,MonsterRancher,dfjjjvf,3,t5_2s34q
