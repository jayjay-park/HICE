6298416,0,t1_cz5jprj,Just a question. No need to rustle your jimmies captain. It becomes too much when the sentinel thinks its too much. Id give up after maybe one or two instance switches but others may really enjoy the challenge. Like you said its just a game and people can be immersed however they like. ,DarkZoneSentinels,cz5k4o6,1,t5_3bwah
6365769,0,t3_42ez44,Sounds good to me. I would like to patrol the DZ waiting for an extraction to occur and lend some support to the team extracting. And certainly hunting rogue agents that appear in the instance of the DZ Im occupying. ,DarkZoneSentinels,czd7uln,1,t5_3bwah
6371300,0,t1_czduflc,My thought is just that since its Beta and being reset Ive seen several folks posting that they intend to Rogue because it doesnt matter. So I think that OPUs during Beta are gonna have their hands full. Im not going to judge the DZ during the Beta for this reason. Im just gonna go have fun there. And probably die a lot killing Rogues. ,DarkZoneSentinels,czduhm1,2,t5_3bwah
6378550,0,t3_42yrdq,Signature weapon? Weve got a large group forming here. Would it be prudent to blend in with whatever gear but have a signature primary or secondaryBoth?? Weapon to identify plus the DzS?,DarkZoneSentinels,czeo7i5,2,t5_3bwah
