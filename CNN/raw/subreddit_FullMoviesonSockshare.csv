What are they? An escape from reality or reality itself? Waking Life follows the dreams of one man and his attempt to find and discern the absolute difference between waking life and the dreamworld. While trying to figure out a way to wake up he runs into many people on his way some of which offer one sentence asides on life others delving deeply into existential questions and lifes mysteries. We become the main character. It becomes our dream and our questions being asked and answered. Can we control our dreams? What are they telling us about life? About death? About ourselves and where we come from and where we are going? The film does not answer all these for us. Instead it inspires us to ask the questions and find the answers ourselves.Critical receptiongt Critical reaction has been mostly positive. It holds a rating of  across  reviews on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  with critical consensus that the talky animated Waking Life is a unique cerebral experience  and an average score of  universal acclaim on Metacritic based on thirtyone reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago SunTimes gave the film four stars out of four describing it as a cold shower of bracing clarifying ideas. Ebert later included the film on his ongoing list of Great Movies. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly awarded the film an A rating calling it a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursues the logicdefying parallel subjects of dreaming and moviegoing while Stephen Holden of The New York Times said it was so verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you cant absorb it unless you have all your wits about you. Dave Kehr of The New York Times found the film to be lovely fluid funny and stated that it never feels heavy or overambitious.
