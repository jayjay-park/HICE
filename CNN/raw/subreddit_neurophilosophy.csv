604822,0,t1_cg3rxaf,gtI think everyone contributes to different degrees to cocreating their own experience at different times.Why do you believe that? If one looks at quantum determinism for example one may find observation to be the determining factor in realities and that may imply an observer is required  but couldnt oneself be determinable of oneself?gtThe Secret is youre an idiot.Certainly! But dont let that dissuade you from trying  Great accomplishments have been made off the back of wild ideas and idiotic assumptions.gtthe absence of sense which is a local effect...On the absolute scale all that there can ever be is senseexperience.That certainly seems plausible that absolutely all that can ever be is sense and local determinability is what cascades its functions down to identifiable events. If one was to contemplate absence of sense one could make the judgement that in that absence of selfaware sense one is beholden to another in other words the determination of reality is cocontrived and in that part whereby one is unsensing then some other must be sensing. I see no logical reason why one could not sense oneself and be the initiator experiencer and viewer of all sensual experience.gtthe entire history of the universe is recapitulated in a local birth and death and through that commitment to loss and mortality the aesthetic intensity of its privacy is amplified.This roams into the realms of karma in my opinion. The purpose of ones life on this planet may be known and may very well be as you believe it to be or it may be for other reasons  or none at all.I dont subscribe to the opinion that consciousness is arbitararily existential or that we are being simply because consciousness is a byproduct of life that doesnt answer the questions of why life exists if it does or why events occur they do. But for the sake of this conversation we should probably assume that we are both alive!.gtthe black lines are a riff in the I Ching system of trigrams. Im showing how the Absolute ||| is nested within a sequence of its opposite variations and using it to signify the nesting of a sensorymotive primitive within its massenergeticspatiotemporal entropicsignifyinginformationtheoretic reflections.Right. Do you think it is possible for you to know what is occurring when matter becomes feelings given that you are basing your searching on the principle that cocreation of reality is the foundation of existence? If as I contemplated recently and bearing in mind that my undertaking and understanding is mainly philosophical one is inhabitant of ones own conscious universe at all times  as is every existential object that is capable of determining or imposing its will  would not the colliding of universes be the basis at which events or sense occurs? I may have actually argued myself into accepting your opinion that cocreation is the cause of sense in our daytoday lives although I dont discount the possibility that it is probable that in some reality one is the creator of ones own sensingThe point to that thought was that one can be seen as ones own universe interacting electively or otherwise with others and others universes. Every observer is unique.gtMainly I am questioning the assumption that sense is assembled from pieces and suggest that such an effect can only occur when there is already a potential for a wholeChicken and egg? What was the instigator of sense? Why? Thanks for the discussion!,neurophilosophy,cg90sc8,1,t5_2rf6a
741252,0,t1_cgoiqxd,I actually think that even a brain in a comadeep sleep would exhibit a less randomnoisy pattern of signalling than a brain which had never received any sensory input. Reason being the experiences which had shaped that brain prior to said coma would still be imprinted on the structure of neural connectivity which would mean that the ambient noise being generated would still end up going through a certain amount of semiordered signal processing.As a result the noise would stimulate very small localized patterns of signalling that were spatially and temporally isolated from each other but individually had some resemblance to the signalling patterns that the brain would exhibit while conscious. To a certain degree we can correlate this sort of processing of ambient noise into signals that are normally meaningful with the fact that sensory deprivation can create certain types of hallucination.,neurophilosophy,cgoja9q,3,t5_2rf6a

Or ..gtWhen a brain reports that it is conscious it is reporting specific information computed within it.If its a report whos reading it? If its a narrative whos listening? If its a movie whos watching? Poor Graziano seems to have fallen for his own sophistry.

1406833,0,t1_ciscnh4,I would assume that ALL people are this way though. The reason for assuming these things is the same reason scientists believe what they believe. They believe things that are persistently shown by something in a certain way. It is learned behaviour. Hell even newtonian physics are just generalities whereas quatum mechanics actually goes to prove that newtonian physics are not precise but just pretty good appoximations that work out for the most part in most situations.Even scientists fall prey to this phenomenon. We only know what we know until things diverge and prove otherwise.For instance space and time. People just assumed they were different until Einstien showed they were not. Then again that doesnt even hold up. They just move together but are NOT one in the same. They are just by products of other things. It is much like saying I would like to hold  minutes of time and I would like  kilos of weight or I want a length of string of inderminite units of string problem being we dont know what diameter of string construction of string such as twisted or woven material of string etc..We assume things are what they are and consider those things proof until shown otherwise.We assumed that men were men and women were women just based on genitals. Now we are trying to figure out what a person is called that has a mans body but has a womans mind but started out as a females body and is attracted to female bodies. Its all kinds of wtf do we do because the convergence is so fucking wide and crazy.We have the issue of what is free will because people dont know if we are talking about if someone has forced their hand to do something from the outside or if their mind is actually doing what they want and who they are is another question. So perspective there is an issue because of divergent and pedantic thought  ontology.So I feel that there needs to be some kind of word for this shit.,neurophilosophy,cismk3p,1,t5_2rf6a
1487044,0,t1_cj2n5bk,gtThat you are not conscious when you sleep doesnt necessarily implies that your organism doesnt experience some form of consciousness. You are not identical to your organism. This is where you start removing your reasoning from commonsense experience and start talking about something entirely outside of experience. What is this your organism of which you speak? I am my body and my body is me. I am not attached by ectoplasm as far as I or anyone else can tell.gtGranted. But imagine that in a parallel universe at the beginning of the th century a philosopher come up and says look guys if we want to understand what light is we will not achieve it within the simple framework of Newtonian mechanics we need to postulate a new fundamental force. Even if this guy made no further prediction wouldnt we be right to regard him as pretty clever?No. Lots of people have lots of ideas and they are not all clever even if they happen to be accidentally correct. I doubt Maxwell was the first or only person to think of something like that. What made him scientifically noteworthy was that he came up with the equations that made predictions that were testable. Your measure of clever has less to do with figuring anything out and more to do with having a good guess. Lots of scientists work on lots of problems but the Nobel Prize goes to the ones that figure it out not the ones that understand that there is a problem to be worked on. Chalmers adds very little to the conversation and what he said in this TED talk he already said  years ago not to mention it was said some  years ago in the religions of India.,neurophilosophy,cj2occc,1,t5_2rf6a
2053026,0,t3_2ib2jd,Not so much one definitive experiment but a collection of interesting things about the brain.  Since we all have one we should try for a vague understanding of some of its quirks.Gazzaniga and Sperry and their work on split brains severing the corpus callosum so that each hemisphere of the brain is pretty much independent of the other.  Couple this with the Wada test where an anaesthetist can administer general anaesthesia to one hemisphere selectively turning off one hemisphere at a time and interrogating them separately while a human subject is still conscious.Also hemispherectomies  the complete removal of a hemisphere and hydrocephalus I think that can lead to stunted growth of a hemisphere or a head full of fluid with a surprisingly thin layer of actual brain matter but it can still hold down a job and raise a family etc.Optional extra read Julian Jaynes the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind and ponder if in a sort of hemispheric fight for dominance maybe there could be a little something to it?OK maybe not everybody needs to know about them but if youre interested in brains and consciousness its fascinating stuff. Theres also a somewhat quirky sounding web page by a Prof Paul Pietsch with an intriguing overview of a number of surgeries involving salamander brains being chopped up and rearranged implicating the transference of learned responses by transplanting parts of a trained salamander into the developing brain of a larval one iirc.  Shufflebrain However about the only reference I can find to him seems to be his eulogy so Im not really sure if his research has been published properly or if he just really enjoyed poking amphibians.I am not in any way a biologist or anything so if any of this has been superseded vindicated debunked etc Id be interested to know how the research has progressed since then or if more modern experiments have shed more light.,neurophilosophy,cl0s9py,4,t5_2rf6a
2224176,0,t1_clmfvi4,gtIt is not possible to attain even a degree in psychology without a very indepth scientific understanding of the brain.I like that youre defending psychology but this bit isnt really true. Psychology is an independent field to neuroscience and so most of what you study can be studied without recourse to the brain. This isnt to say that the brain is irrelevant to thoughts and behavior or that knowledge of neuroscience isnt helpful to psychology just that there is no fundamental or necessary link between the two.Most people with psych degrees even postgrad ones will have little understanding of the brain and rarely anything above basic knowledge of structures. Its like the relationship of physics to chemistry  understanding physics as a chemist can be extraordinarily useful in some areas of chemistry but for the most part you dont need to delve that far down the levels of analysis to do chemistry. ,neurophilosophy,clmjoel,8,t5_2rf6a

8189186,0,t3_4rfmu0,This article has a lot to say about Panpsychism and IIT a theory of consciousness I find extremely problematic.Heres what Tononi says about Integrated Information Theory IIT in a nutshellgtIntegrated information measures how much can be distinguished by the whole above and beyond its parts and Phi is its symbol. A complex is where Phi reaches its maximum and therein lives one consciousness a single entity of experience.IIT and the cool math it does gives us an interesting measure of information integration. What it does not do is provide us with a single argument to thing that information integration IS consciousness. This amounts to an arbitrary stipulation. In other words cited below Informationbased theories of consciousness are circular that is they seek to explain consciousness with a conceptinformationthat presupposes consciousness.I can only outline some of the arguments here and point to other sources.First you can construct a dilemma. Either. IIT is vulnerable to totally ridiculous counterexamples  by IIT math a XOR gate has a high amount of Phi and some very silly arrangements of certain logic gates can be constructed that have higher Phi than humansOr . IIT cannot help itself to any empirical evidence or claims of usefulness. To use empirically supported claims like the cerebellum has less Phi and is not necessary for our consciousness thus this is support for IIT you have to stipulate how our intuitions about consciousness fit Phi in a way that isnt subject to the counterexamples presented in . In other words You cant have your cake and eat it to if you are a panpsychist. You cant say that photodiodes are conscious but then say the only interesting consciousness is that of corticothalamic systems.There are additionally classic arguments IIT is deeply vulnerable to such as the fading qualia argumentgtAny theory such as IIT which rejects computational functionalism is vulnerable to one of the strongest arguments in philosophy of mind fadingdancing qualia. Briefly the fading qualia argument imagines that neurons are slowly replaced one by one with nanobots that perform the same function . If computational functionalism is correct then there will be no change in the persons conscious experience as their brain is slowly replaced by machines because the system is always functionally identical. Now assume computational functionalism is incorrect as the experiment continues the subjects consciousness will either slowly fade away or will suddenly cease after replacement of a single critical neuron. The sudden disappearance of all subjective experience with one neuron seems highly implausible. On the other hand if consciousness slowly fades the subject will be aware of this yet because the new brainmachine is functionally identical to the original they will be unable to act on or report this strange subjective experience. To show the same argument works with IIT we keep the effector part of the nanobots and run the computations via radio transmission in a feedforward algorithm run in a digital computer with a Von Neumann architecture. In this case IIT would predict the neuronnanobot hybrid has zero  hence IIT would claim that the neuronnanobot hybrid is not conscious and thus the subject would experience fading qualia.Finally there are total absurdities that IIT would force us to accept. If group phi exceeds the phi of the individuals IIT predicts that the group will become conscious and suppress the consciousness of the individuals turning them into unconscious zombies. Additionally entities like the United States might be conscious. These reductio arguments seem completely sufficient to reject an unargued for stipulation about what consciousness is.Sourcesfurther reading,neurophilosophy,d5177cl,12,t5_2rf6a
