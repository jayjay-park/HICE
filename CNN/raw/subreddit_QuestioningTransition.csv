954490,0,t1_ch9o5pq,Thanks Interbingung!  I agree that sometimes people can keep chasing the high that often comes with transgender actions.I respect your path but I dont see how thats different from either the closet or coming out without transitioning.  I havent heard of anyone whos been able to not be transgender at all because the feelings do keep coming back.,QuestioningTransition,chcs857,1,t5_317hc
