622192,0,t1_cgazjv9,oh Ive had plenty of whisky that hasnt had these flavors but only a bottle or so every couple months for about a year. not too many just and only  single malts. Ive just noticed a disgusting tasting note thats in some bottles and Im wondering if there is a way too look up or find the tasting notes to see this ahead of time.  like how some people dont like peated whisky I saw that in another thread it brought up super tasters. which I am I made this thread to see if there were any other super tasters so I could see what types of whiskies theyve tried and what types to avoid. I really liked glenfiddich Im going to get a glenlivet and old putney since they were close on scotchs flavor map. and a yamazaki. so hopefully those wont taste like garbage.,whisky,cgazsb5,1,t5_2qryn

1627493,0,t3_2cy1hh,I cook mainly Italian English and Indian cuisine. I try to write creativelyI am very interested in finding and enjoying really good bars and pubs and trying to avoid the more gimmicky ones that thrive off gentrification. Also have a interest in Gin Mezcal and Craft Beer. I read a lot currently working on Ulysses.Im very interested in politics and current affairs. But to be honest my main interests outside of scotch are football or soccer Im not going to be pretentious and make a big deal or any cringey jokes and music. I love football Im a huge Liverpool fan. I love the culture and societal aspect of football how it is at once unifying and divisive how class and politics are so often tied to it... Its difficult to explain its importance to communities across England especially to those uninterested in the sport or from nonfootballing nations. As for music Im constantly listening and thinking about it. I do a lot of analysing texts at uni and I cant help but do this with music.

3172325,0,t3_2wdghk,Im probably a book nerd above all others so my recommendations are coming from that perspective.I highly highly highly recommend The Curious Bartender An Odyssey of Malt Bourbon amp Rye Whiskies by Tristan Stephenson. I dont know what youre looking for in a Whisky book but this one has a little bit of everything. It covers some history some tasting tips distillery profiles and tasting notes but no ratings. There are also some interesting cocktails in the end with some really bizarre and interesting photography attached to them. This is just one of those books that looks great on the bookshelf is a pleasure to hold and look through and it reads really well. Its borderline a coffee table book but its usefulness elevates it above that and its a tad smaller in size.I also really liked Tasking Whiskey by Lew Bryson. Its kind of a whiskey  book but even if you think you know a lot about tasting whiskey and how and why its made you will probably learn something. Its also really well written with good photography and some nice diagrams and charts.Finally there is The World Atlas of Whisky by Dave Broom. This is essentially a coffee table book but still a good one IMO. It has more distillery profiles and tasting notes that the ones above but less of the other stuff. Its larger in size has nice photography and is fun to just peruse through.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading all three of these books while sipping on a nice dram!Oh and all three of these came out last year so they are pretty current discussing whats available right now.EDIT Formatting,whisky,coqt6b1,1,t5_2qryn

5071680,0,t1_cux9y71,gt Since beer is barley  hops  water  yeast leaving out one of the main ingredients hops is a big classification issue. There are some beers that dont have hops but theyre ltltltlt of the market.Hop flavor isnt desired in the final product so whisky is distilled from low or distillers beer. Which is beer. Some whiskies are hopped just like some beers are not.gt The ingredients they have in common too are treated differently. In particular whisky production generally uses a sour mash process while beer production does not there are exceptions of course. Barley is malted in both cases but only Scotch production smokes the stuff.Whisky in general is not sour mash tends to be particular to cornbased whisky like Bourbon. Many traditional beers are smoked e.g. Rauchbier and many whiskies are not.gt Aging and the presence of wood in aging is also a big deal. Depending on your whisky you might be using new oak bourbon or secondfill Scotch and aging on the order of years or decades. A beer typically ages in tanks and as long as is needed for fermentation to complete. The aging process is where a whisky probably gets  of its character and this process doesnt occur in beer production with the exception of some oak aged variants here and there.Yes but has nothing to do with whether whisky is made from beer. Which it is. And some beers are aged in wood casks which again has nothing to do with this.gt If youre going to start comparing whisky to stuff beer isnt even the best comparison. You could say whisky is just vodka that spent a few years in a barrel which would be way more accurate.Vodka is distilled to a much higher proof to produce a neutral flavor. Whisky cannot be by law to maintain some of the flavors produced in the beer its distilled from. gt A beer is produced differently and owes its character to different aspects of the production process vs. whisky. Distillation is one of those things but its far from the only difference between whisky and beer.Simply speaking whiskey is nothing more than distilled beer.
