11769,0,t1_cefr1qk,Things to do There was a designated drinking area. It wasnt very big and the line into it was huge so I didnt bother with it. There were some cool art installations to look at. A lot of people were up near the Starbucks playing on the fountain. There food trucks on Hill and Broadway but they also had ridiculous lines. There was a stage in front of city hall where they had a DJ and a band play as well as some other entertainment. Now its hard to say what their target audience was. Like I said there was alcohol but the designated area was relatively small. There wasnt anything there that would indicate they wanted this to be a kid friendlyfamily thing but because alcohol was controlled it wasnt anything that I wouldnt take a kid to. ,LosAngeles,cefrw34,2,t5_2qht0

Definitely worth thinking about.I dont have a job sorted out yet so first priority would be to settle the family wife two kids in somewhere nice schools neighbourhood etc. We have visited Laguna Beach a number of times and loved it so the motivation is to move and live there  then find a job that works with living there.I make a reasonable salary in Australia in a fairly specialistniche area  so there arent lots of jobs to pick and choose from around LA.  Of the  suitable ones that Ive seen advertised over the last few weeks  have been in Burbank one in City of Industry and one in Irvine.

Maybe plan your trip so you need only rent the car for the long trips you are planning and use metro for the rest of the time. SF is also  hours away so that needs to be taken into consideration. You CAN take the train to SF though that takes a whole day or you can look at options like megabus.com which usually have really decent fares if you book ahead of time.

There simply arent enough cops to cover every street corner.  Allowing concealed carry changes that by allowing law abiding citizens to defend themselves.The argument against concealed carry is that it will create wild west like conditions where vigilantism is rampant and people settle every dispute with an exchange of lead.

Such a freedom creates incredible opportunity for quirks new creative ideas and unexpected pockets of culture. the drama of the landscape history and reputation.

429957,0,t1_cfpamwu,They just attach to your gutters and store up the water that would normally go rushing into a swampy pool in the backyard. Ymmv but it was one of the easiest DIY projects Ive taken on and even though I went the expensive route I think theyve already paid for themselves after one year I used the water from three barrels to water my raised beds and wash my wetsuits all last summer and didnt touch the hose attached to my house until sept. Plus they meant my backyard didnt flood the way it normally would. Yay!I bought mine online because Im vain and wanted a pottery look for about  each on Amazon. They have similar ones at Home Depot and Lowes but they were too bulky for my car so free shipping ftw. Since my gutters are plasticPVC installation took about  minutes and I think  of those minutes were spent searching for my box cutter. I cut the drain spout attached a flexispout attachment from Home Depot and...done!I got the kind that keeps a little plant on top so I added a mint plant and havent really paid attention since. They have a screen over any holes to prevent Mosquitos and a hose already attached to the bottom. I just use the hose to fill up a bucket and dump that on my plants as needed. There are fancier setups or freecheap setups using pickle barrels or trash barrels but thats what works for me. The other two green steps I took last year were tore out the lawn and planted native plants in front because I hated mowing the lawn that I never used and I replaced my lightbulbs to LEDs and fluorescents which cut my energy bill by  a month.

1616044,0,t3_2ctj6k, No valuable input for you here sorry. There are a number of reasonably affordable areas near Century City. I have known people with pretty nice places along Beverly Glen blvd. which might as well be in Century City. There are lots of places along Santa Monica blvd running from Veteran to Federal or Barrington that offer nice some fancy some merely basic and fairly affordable apartments. A longer drive would land you in Santa Monica or Brentwood both more expensive and more upscale in general to the west to the east you could look in West Hollywood also more upscale as well as LGBT friendly to the south you could look in Palms or Culver City there would probably be less traffic commuting to Century City from these areas  but dont quote me on that. I think  would get you a fairly nice  BR in any of these areas fairly nice approximates to modern facilities a decent building and at least one parking space. Varies by location you have to take into account the lower density of LA when compared to Manhattan. If youre working in Century City for example you may only have a couple of dozen places within a reasonable walking distance assuming an hour lunch and given the type of businesses there they might well run you more than   . If youre in downtown LA you might have more options. In general    for a sandwich and fries is probably close to what you can expect I doubt youll find many delis that would impress you  given what Ive heard from other NYC transplants  . Very broad question and you will get many different answers from users in this subreddit. Its almost too broad to answer but Ill give it a quick shot. If you were commuting from Santa Monica to Century City I would expect nothing less than  minutes in traffic on surface streets  mi. as the crow flies and there will usually be traffic. If you were commuting from and apartment in downtown to say Sony Pictures in Culver City you wouldnt drive at all youd be able to take the train and walk or bike the remainder of the commute you can bring a full sized bike on the trains and given theres a spot on the rack on the bus as well. If you lived in either of those places and you wanted to go visit your friend who lived in Sherman Oaks youd be looking at a good hour long drive in traffic.Sorry Im getting too detailed with my attempt here. Traffic depends highly on the hour of the day and what parts of the city youre traveling between. Knowing good shortcuts to take and routes to avoid is something you learn.,LosAngeles,cjivap8,1,t5_2qht0

1866037,0,t3_2fy94t,gt In the United States a moderate to strong El Nio often brings milder winter temperatures in the Northeast and Northwest and storms across the Southeast.Dont know if or how it is related but the leaves in New York City are already beginning to show fall colors. This is about  weeks earlier than typical and is usually the warning sign of a long brutal cold winter not the kind of winter we get during El Nino years. Winter  as mentioned in the article we got two inches of snow...total. Climate scientists also mentioned that Californias very warm dry winter was directly linked to the jet stream ridge that kept forcing all that polar air down the East Coast.fingers crossed for you guys though.

1977317,0,t1_ckr3kwe,All that is really great but it has little to do with driving without a license.  You want to make some grand declaration about alleged racism and justify your entitled attitude about illegal immigrants to demand they be allowed to have a license since they are already driving anyway.  Why reward unlawful behavior?  There is nothing racist about following the law.  You want to make it that way because you want sympathy.  But there is no power in pity.  Boo hoo they have to get to work.  So does everybody else.  Walk bus metro uber lyft carpool get a bike.  The answer isnt to break the law.  And its not fucking racist to want the laws of this great country enforced.   Im sure the people living here illegally are directly protesting the CIA and the US led drug wars.  Yea right.  Im sure thats why they are here.  Give me a break.  I have many many friends who are here illegally so dont act like the rest of us dont get it.  You dont deserve special treatment more than anyone else because your family is from Mexico or whatever Latin American country they are from.  I have a friend who escaped Apartheid in South Africa by coming here.  He and  friends used a global underground railroad as their guide jumping from one country to the next.  But only  made it here because one of them was eaten by sharks.   I have another friend  from Sri Lanka.  He was forced to fight for the Tamil Tigers as an  yr old and somehow got a visa to come here.  I have another friend whose family was in Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam war.  He was only  when his brother went missing and he and his parents and his sister were sent to a work camp.  His parents were forced to get up and work in a labor camp every day for years. They were kept on a starvation diet and were killed if they tried to escape.  My friend had an uncle who was in the US and managed to get them out and bring his family here.  It wasnt until after they came to the US that they learned his brother had been killed.  There are shitty places all over the world.  Latin America isnt any different than the shit going on in Africa the Middle East etc.  The US is under no obligation to give itself up for any country to exploit.  We just make it easy for you to do it and that fosters a sense of entitlement.  So pardon my ass all the way to hell if I dont feel sorry for you waiting for some phone call.  You and your family are damn lucky to be here just like my family who managed to escape the Nazi regime.    So dont act like you deserve it and demand to be rewarded.  Know what the  export to Mexico is?  Its money.  They aint putting the money they earn back into this economy.  Get off your high horse.  ,LosAngeles,ckrgta5,1,t5_2qht0

2176807,0,t1_clg13hf,gt I know improving infrastructure helps keep down cost improve transportation and creates jobs.Well yeah.  Of course improving infrastructure is good. I dont think anyone is questioning that.But its all about getting the most bang for your buck especially when youre dealing with crazy sums of money like . billion. And I just cant agree that adding to an already extremely healthily builtout road network is the best way we could spend . billion. Weve put so much money into LAs freeway system that were now getting diminishing returns for each dollar we put into it.Case it point the  car pool lanes. It took   years of construction disruption and . billion and what did we get for it  months after it opened? Slightly more traffic and delay than we had before they started. Thats what happens you waste money expanding an alreadyexpandedtothelimit system.  A drop in the bucket.On the other hand you have our transit system which could use all the help it can get. Currently its fantastic if you happen to live and work near a station but LAs so spread out that theres only a small fraction of people that can claim this.  We need to keep building more lines  really as many as we can  so we can reap the benefits of having a complete transit network. If everyone in this city lived within a mile of a transit station it would be transformative for LA.  The city would be unrecognizable in a good way.Thats why the thought of spending . billion on this project is so offensive to me.  Not because we shouldnt be spending money on infrastructure but because wed be spending such a vast sum on the wrong kind of infrastructure that we need in .,LosAngeles,clgiwnh,1,t5_2qht0

So it really doesnt matter what you think about them or if youre on their side or not. You quite frankly have no power in the situation and are therefore irrelevant. I dont agree with these protesters views but I support and laud their commitment to the democratic mechanisms which bring about change in society. You should at least support that.

You shouldnt automatically assume the interpretation that lines up with your personal beliefs. You should assume the interpretation that makes the most sense in context of what is being said. I still stand by my original understanding of his statement.  more hours of your logically hallow statements isnt going to to change my original interpretation to match yours.

Say something with substance about the original statement that has even the slightest chance of not being something I already considered and you suddenly have a nonzero chance of achieving your goal.,LosAngeles,cmyv786,1,t5_2qht0

2769133,0,t3_2rshle,For those unfamiliar with this hike theres beautiful hiking trail leading up to the hollywood sign. It takes you pretty close to the sign and probably has the best of the signs you can get. Even without the sign however its still an amazing trail with gorgeous panoramic views of the surrounding area. In my opinion might be the best hike you can do in the area.However its been closed off for like the last year due to them installing a gate and now when the gate is complete its closing off the little parking there was there. You will be unable to park on the neighborhood streets anymore as that will be permit only. Basically only the local residents will be able to access the trail making it a private trail to themselves. Proposals in the past to have a shuttle system bring in hikers directly to the trailhead and elminating any parking problems have been nixed by the neighborhood activists.I wanted to share this article because its an absolute shame that a few neighborhood residents have been able to restrict access to acres of beautiful public land. Please share this article and ask your elected officials how they can let this happen. I would like this trail to be be easily accessible by anyone who wants to use it.,LosAngeles,cniu956,18,t5_2qht0

These are criminals and seriously mentally ill people.Yeah because Skid Row doesnt have any of those. sgtThis is about dangerous people living in the streets and preying on law abiding citizens.This is about people seeing folks who dont fit a certain mold and feeling scared of them. And those people reacting badly to that response.gtI guess I wasnt nice enough when I locked up my bike and a group of homeless dudes tried to steal it. But I bet if you locked your bike right next to mine they would have left your bike alone. Not tried to extort money from you to get it back like they did to me right? Because that wouldnt happen to you right? Certainly never has. But then I make eye contact and nod or say hello. If they panhandle I say Im sorry I cant but best of luck to you. Im respectful of them like any other person. Theyre human beings like me. I treat them that way and wonder of wonders they nearly always act that way. Toward me. Not toward everyone theyre in a bad place and they will justify taking advantage of folks if they can. But it takes some rationalization to decide that someone deserves to be mistreated.gtBetter yet why dont you look up Lily Allen?I just did. Seems shes in the same category as Iggy Azalea. She had a miscarriage once and was the victim of a celebrity death hoax but seems shes alive and well. I also tried Lily Allen murder. And the Los Angeles Times Homicide Report all years female victim not officerinvolved... no results for lily allen. So I dont know the circumstances of that murder and I dont know that anyone does.Bad shit happens sometimes. We should be giving people who are mentally ill the help they need. We should be able to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of people who have mental health issues andor a history of violence. We shouldnt be leaving people on the street period. Because it would be better and healthier for ALL of us if we took care of these people.But yes it is pretty amazing what happens when you actually treat them like real people. I dont have any idea if it would have saved Lily sometimes youre in the wrong place at the wrong time running afoul of someone elses delusion. In that case our utter lack of a safety net would be the problem not her individual approach or attitude.,LosAngeles,cog9ff5,1,t5_2qht0

3529310,0,t3_30oj5g,I have an extra bike so I usually give visitors a bike tour of SM and Venice. Grab a breakfast burrito at Dogtown Coffee then ride down Main St to Windward. Pit stops down Abbott Kinney and Rose if they want to check them out. Scope muscle beach and the Venice Boardwalk weirdness. Watch the skaters at the skatepark or the surfers nearby maybe grab a coffee at Menottis if you didnt get one earlier then ride back along the beach path. If you have time ride past the SM pier the tunnel is neat to Temescal Canyon and back. The beach there is much less crowded and a shorter walk to the water. Maybe pack a lunch and eat it here? Perhaps Bay Cities Godmothers? I also love taking people to Tacos Punta Cabras or one of the other tacos spots nearby mariscos place on Lincoln near Whole Foods or the truck on Rose. If they dig shopping rd St is also an option to putz through but I usually avoid it. Feels like a mall.Get back in time to head east pass through Fairfax and Mulholland and maybe make a stop if theyre into the street wear scene and then hit Griffith Observatory for a short hike and a sunset? Then head back down the hill and find yourself some jammin dinner and beers. Maybe Mohawk Bend in Echo Park? Golden State? Depends on your crowd. You could also go for fancy cocktails or total foodie high brow at Animal or Son of a Gun or whatever floats your boat. I always liked Jones for old school Hollywood vibes but there are so many options its nuts. If youre not completely exhausted or gutted at this point hit Milk for ice cream macaron sandwiches then drive up Mulholland and sneak into the overlook.If they dont like LA after that... I mean.

3562677,0,t3_312bxk,Great another mall no one will shop at! and who loves living at the mall more than valley residents? With a great view of the  too!  Sounds like a great plan to me. Sure its a very usable parcel of land but developers need to get creative with site use rather than a cookie cutter ideal of what they think people would like. I honestly am tired of these site proposals catering to the curated experience which truthfully does not exist other than in the mind of utopian thinking millenials. Yes there was a mall there before but at that time the word curate was reserved for museums and art galleries. Shove a BJs chipotle pizza rev ect in there and you will have people there but last time I checked people do not like living next to freeways... or at shopping malls. ,LosAngeles,cpyddmq,0,t5_2qht0

If two signs are both readable but one takes a full minute to comprehend and the other takes  seconds there is a clear benefit. Do we really want people stopping in a traffic lane to stare at a sign tree trying to figure out when they can and can not park because thats the situation with some of these more complex parking zones. ,LosAngeles,cpzdow4,3,t5_2qht0

I wasnt saying its difficult for you to read.  You made it clear it was very easy for you.  I was trying to get across that the multiple parking sign system in Los Angeles is notoriously confusing.Again not saying YOU have any difficulty.. the rest of the population does.  Here is an example of an overly complex sign  Yes I realize that by taking a minute or two we can all figure it out.. but it doesnt need be this confusing.Sign one clearly says no parking pmpm on Tuesdays got itSign two No Parking ampm on school days essentially MonFri except holidays ok..Sign three No Parking pmam MonSat no problemSign four  hour parking from ampm MonSat... but what about the school days???  Can I park here on a Thursday at pm?  Or really we can just park there on Saturdays for  hours between ampm unless its a school holiday.Anyway I think we can both agree the new system is more efficient.,LosAngeles,cpzhkz1,1,t5_2qht0

After the citizenelected city council endorsed the presence of the protestors.  And the city isnt even saying that didnt happen  only you are.The reason theyre settling is because the city knows no laws were broken and the detentions were illegal... so when the arrested say they committed no crime the city agrees they committed no crime and the judge awards a settlement based on the premise that they were detained for no lawful reason it seems the only way youd think the settlement is not OK is if you want your morality policing the streets.

People keep containers of food unrefrigerated for days at a time.  Conditions where people sleep are almost always atrocious often with feces and urine and food waste in proximity to sleeping areas.The encampments were never worse than skid row encampments when I was there.

Try hiking to the ski hut if you feel good and have enough water continue on up Baldy Bowl.

However you on your bicycle and me and my motorcycle are much more likely to be maimed than people in an automobile. Anyway I like to give transplants that move here advice to be damn careful. We have so many illegal aliens here they have nothing to lose and most with no license or insurance. You get hit as a pedestrian or on a bike you will continue to be run over by more cars as you lay bleeding in the streets. Especially if its dark outside. I give advice to people because as a lifelong resident of SoCal and a trucker I have seen some horrific shit.,LosAngeles,crfml59,1,t5_2qht0

4040633,0,t1_crgun5t,You need to be a TAXI to accept TAXI fares.  Hence the name UberTAXI.  All it is is a taxi company using Ubers platform for fares.  So unless you used the Uber app to get in a marked Taxi you have not been automatically tipping your drivers.  In fact you havent tipped any driver on the UberX platform.  But something tells me you couldnt care less.  In contrast UberTaxi is exactly what it sounds like real live licensed taxi cabs,LosAngeles,crgv2gp,-3,t5_2qht0

4671300,1,t1_ctjcoa9,Well for one you can look at the police force and see where they reside. They will almost definitely not come from nowhere near the area and police a neighborhood they do not understand. This adds to the hostility between the police as they will see everyone as a potential threat to their safety and the people that live there. I have lived in Hawthorne and Inglewood all of my life along with visiting friends living in Compton and South Central and have experienced this harassment firsthand. There is also degradation of local politics with cronyism and the corruption within school boards. If you just look at the state of high schools in Compton such as Centennial Dominguez and Compton high you can get a better picture of the environments that the youth experience on a daily basis. Degraded spaces that are meant to be havens for youth trying to get away from the drugs gangs and so on. Bear in mind this are only a few examples of issues that are part of a larger picture. ,LosAngeles,ctjdalr,-2,t5_2qht0

With no where else to go this seems to be cause and effect in action.The city council may change city ordinance to disallow this and they will just try it somewhere else but from what I heard many of the people who attended a meeting regarding this were in favor of the tiny houses.

The streets are lined with cars that arent moving all over Southern California not just DTLA. The reason you cant put your vehicle on the side of the road is because theres usually already a car there. Theres already a car there because parking is so cheap. Automated cars will certainly help. A lot. But if youre keeping up with climate change projections were gonna have to get more electric cars not drive so much and not even build cars in the first place.

But as an L.A. native I would say some less visited tourists places where you can bar hop and find great food Downtown Culver City Culver Blvd between Overland until it ends  dont forget to check out Fathers Office! Main Street in Santa Monica all the tourists go to Third Street but Main Street has great food and drink sometimes bands play down there too and in the Southbay the beach cities of Manhattan Beach Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach  really amazing local beach atmosphere. Manhattan Beach Post and Little Sister are both amazing restaurants that people from all over L.A. come for. If you like beer go to Torrance also in the Southbay and do a beer crawl at our local breweries Monkish The Dudes Strand Absolution Smog City etc. Im not sure when youll be here but this could be right up your alley May I ask what attracts you to The Roof on Wilshire? Ive never been there but we have SO many roof type dining and drinking options in L.A. Most people just go to the one thats closest to them.

Times is the only thing in the world who calls it that the abstract and ideological discussion of gun control here kind of misses the point.  Guns arent easier to get.now than they were last September.  The sharp jump in homicide is not related to any current discussion or policy decision related to guns.Much of what Im hearing from people in the area is that this is a product of realignment.  Youll notice that many of the victims are in their thirties and forties  much much older than is typical for gang killings.  Often theyre recent returns to the community and when they were last here things were different.These arent drug killings.

5068789,0,t1_cuwugtx,Buzzing in here from upensotroppoEverything heshe says is correct. the Visa issue is going to be a HUGE factor. Like many have already said if you want to work on a feature you must have a unique skill that or reputation that the company is willing to sponsor. If you dont theres plenty of people already here that can do the job. Now without a work Visa you can visit but legally you cannot work at least on a legit studio feature Mandy amp CL movies are another question In theory the best thing you can do is come and intern at a studio for a few months say  or  months and make as many contacts as you can. Thats always the best way to do it. If youre good and make the right contacts i.e. be sociable and a great worker you can approach someone. If they like you enough and I cant stress this enough people MUST LIKE YOU they will help you out. Ive seen some amazing workers who have no social skills passed over for jobs because theyre not open enough. People MUST LIKE YOU to help you out. Do you have any connections in London? If you do use them to your advantage. The big thing is many features are not being shot in London so in theory you dont even need to move to LA to do the feature thing. Wonder woman fantastic Beasts Doctor Strange are just some of the huge movies prepping in London atm do you need to move to LA? Rent is cheaper than London here so you wont be shocked to know its expensive. If you want to be a PA be prepared to work long hours be seen not heard not be thanked work harder than everyone else and have a vehicle that doesnt break down. We all started at the bottom and Im basing that on my experiences working my way up. People respect you when you do your work efficiently and dont bitch. If you do somehow manage to get work Ill disagree with redditor pensotroppo about health insurance. EP amp Cast and Crew offer the minimum health insurance for about  dollars a month so you dont have to worry about that. The starting rate for a PA is wk. You cant live on that here in LA unless you live in a converted garage so be prepared to either live with someone else or in your car. Keep your ears open and NEVER be a starfucker. Theres nothing worse than a PA who wants to always be around DiCaprio. Seen it many times especially the ladies.  Word to you he doesnt care about you. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have. Itll be quite hard not being an American. Best advice I can give you develop your skillcraft in the London show and when youre qualified enough make the move. But if you absolutely have to move out to LA do it at your own caution itll be a tough road.,LosAngeles,cuwzb19,3,t5_2qht0

If you look at the next country down in the list Germany and you calculate based on the country size ratio at . percent then the US would have to accept  immigrants a year to keep up.

Id be delighted to hear other realistic suggestions to improve sustainability and quality of life.gt So Im curious how youd answer the question of why the companies are deciding to set up shop in Santa MonicaI dont know either. Based on what I see theres a double standard between what businesses budget for their own location and their top executives and whats budgeted for the majority of the work force.Its somehow OK to spend half of the budget renting in a fancy beach area  but paying employees based on the LA cost of living so they can commute less than  hour and have healthy productive lives with their families is considered a terrible burden that would close businesses!I understand small businesses making the mistake of thinking location for a tech company is that much more important and doable than paying workers decently yet last time I worked for a small business it was located against traffic out east in Monrovia which makes a lot of sense  but me and my colleagues work for one of the most profitable techmedia companies in the world yet senior workers with salaries that sound impressive at first barely make ends meet in LA. If these relatively well paid people are struggling no wonder homelessness is rising faster than ever in the history of this city!

5411915,0,t1_cw377bd,Yes it absolutely matters why he did it.  Was he lying in wait?  Was it premeditated?  Was this an accident?  meaning was he just trying to scare him and he accidentally killed him? Was this a crime of passion?  Did he conspire with others to kill him?  Did he conspire with others to only scare him and things got out of control?  Was this done to empower a street gang?  All of that and a lot more matters. Circumstances like that can be the difference between first or second degree murder manslaughter reckless endangerment etc.  And that absolutely makes a difference in how the trial goes forth.  And the investigation and the trial are tied very closely together.  Certain pieces of evidence may not be allowed at all.  Or if the confession was coerced it cant be used as evidence in the trial. What happens in the investigation can directly have an impact on how the trial plays out.  Plus the investigation has to find enough evidence witnesses motives to even ask for a trial.  And then the DA has to decide if he thinks he can win the case.  Hes not going to waste the taxpayers money on a trial he doesnt think he has a good shot at winning.  ,LosAngeles,cw3fjrg,0,t5_2qht0

I read in one article that the driver was going  mph and swerved at the very last minute to exit which indicates that its possible that the dip they hit was simply the demarcation between the offramp and the continuing freeway. If thats the case then the blame is with the reckless driver and I feel sick that these young people paid the price. ,LosAngeles,cw6ur3m,1,t5_2qht0

5465978,0,t1_cwaado3,The theoretical support for this phenomenon is pretty obvious  people have choices about their travel and they drive more when they think driving is easier and they drive less when they think driving is harder. So we should already expect some amount of this phenomenon  losing capacity slows traffic much less than one would predict from a dumb model that assumes exactly the same number of cars squeezing through less space and gaining capacity speeds traffic much less than one would predict from a dumb model that assumes exactly the same number of cars using more space and switching some drivers to bikes speeds traffic much less than one would predict from a dumb model that assumes that all other potential drivers have exactly the same behavior despite reduced traffic.For empirical evidence about just how strong this sort of effect is google induced demand. There are lots of studies out there claiming various strengths of this effect though every particular traffic situation is different. I think much of this literature is overblown with people sometimes even claiming exact matching of the level of congestion before and after. Economic theory suggests that the rebound effect of induced demand should end up with a total amount of congestion somewhere between the easy drive of the dumb model and the exactly equal congestion of the exact matching model. The studies seem to suggest it is closer to the latter than the former in congested metropolitan areas though the former is probably a better model than the latter in extremely uncongested rural and exurban areas but Id want to look more closely at lots of real data to say much confidently.,LosAngeles,cwabwfc,1,t5_2qht0

My car stopped dead coolant line and tons of other things busted in the second lane from the left.  After I probably stupidly got out and took some pictures I called  and sat in my car with people freaking out all around me.  A cop showed up and pushed my car off the highway down the SM exit into the gas station there.  He asked me if I wanted to file a report and I kept trying to ask why I wouldnt file one.  He said it is your fault if you hit a stationary object in the road regardless of circumstance.  With the report if goes on your record and you get a point or whatever it is for a collision  I checked with my insurance company and I didnt need the report to file the claim so I didnt do it. ,LosAngeles,cwevccg,1,t5_2qht0

Sure the shitty locks they give out with the guns arent going to stop a determined thief but speaking as a gun owner myself thats not how you should be securing your firearms. Regardless a gun sitting on a table or in a drawer is a much more likely target for theft than one in a locked container or in a safe.

5524099,0,t1_cwhq5f0,having a place to live may be a need but its not a right.  You could argue that it should be and perhaps Id agree with you but currently it isnt one.  You dont make sense to me.  Youre against the current fauxcapitalist  system and post in anarchy etc but youre arguing for MORE government regulation as long as it benefits you at the cost of other peoples labor.  This would result in an authoritarian government but you dont seem to touch on that.You would love it if the government swooped in and redistributed landlabor as long as it helps you.  But if it helps another class of people or if the government stays neutral and lets people do whatever they want to instead of going out there and getting a piece of the pie you just complain that you arent getting enough to eat.  Your entire argument seems to stem from the idea that you have a right to have things provided for you because you were born.  I dont see life this way.  I see it as you have right not to be physically assaulted you have a right not to be stolen from you have a right to exist....you have a right to be left alone...but you dont have a right to material resources.  Nobody owes you shit except the liberty to be left alone.  If you want anything above and beyond sunshine and air then you gotta work for it.  is it fucked up?  yeah...but as long as scarcity exists there will always be competition for resources.  Equitable distribution is absolutely impossible.What you are proposing taking apartment buildings from private owners and letting the people own them would involve a HUGE HUGE HUGE amount of government oversight.  These projects wont just happen magically they will need to be managed. Disputes need to be settled. Youd basically be adding an entire new arm to the government.  Youre creating an enforcement branch that by definition would need teeth to be effective.  Youre making the government more authoritarian by asking them to get involved.Why havent you purchased  acre of land in Califoria and built a home on it?  Because you dont know how?  Whose fault is that?  How long can you blame others for your own shortcomings?Im not a perfect person I have a lot of flaws but I do not pretend they are other peoples fault.gtLook you still need to explain to me why its valid to jack up rent prices for your own benefit as a landlord even if it hurts the community.It is their land.  If you dont like it go get your own land.  You dont have a right to whatever you want just because you were born.  There is plenty of housing you can afford right now the problem is youre too good for it and placing all kinds of restrictions on what kind of housing youll accept.  Like a starving person that is also glutenfree.  i.e. youre being ridiculous.Does the system have problems?  Yes it has a ton of problems and in fact you dont go far enough in your condemnations.  You are still barely scratching the surface of howwhy things are corrupt.  You are trying to take a shortcut hey lets steal shit instead of providing real solutions that are actually feasible.  If you want to attack something my suggestion is to attack the corrupt currency system which is the source of all economic problems instead of attacking the concept of property ownership which society will NEVER agree with you on.Answers come from within.

Think about it this way....crimes are committed by people with jobs everyday.  Most of those people have jobs with small unrecognizable companies so the story for the most part doesnt appeal to the general public.  However the stories appeal to the public increases significantly when you put a high ranking individual and tie them to a name that everyone is familiar with.  In this case Taco Bell.  I didnt do a good job of explaining the intent behind my initial comment but Im not trying to be nit picky about titles and things like that.  Just wanted to start a conversation around how the media has put more emphasis on him being an executive at Taco Bell than on the crime itself and the potential dangers of being an Uber driver.

5575170,0,t1_cwn32ya,Then can you explain the Armenian Stereotype? I have Spent a lot of time in Glendale and lived in Burbank.  Im not saying ALL but a huge amount of Armenians tend to display their wealth in cars jewelry clothes their homes are often large and the outside is overdone with opulent decor.   Also a regular occurrence I would see women paying with food stamps or EBT cards carrying their Gucci bags and then go get into  plus luxury car.   I do know really good Armenian people as well people that have changed my life in such a positive way that I have been so grateful for having touched my life.  So Im not making a general statement about all Armenians but what I mentioned tends to be the stereo typical Armenian... How did they get this stereotype and still be considered true Christians?

5637781,0,t3_3sbgag,I moved to San Bernardino last year and work on the edge of Culver City near FairfaxLa Cienega.Ive been commuting via Metrolink and Metro since I moved. It takes about . hours each way  hours if taking the express trains including transfers and walking. I typically either read a book surf the web telecommute or nap during my rides. Pretty relaxing actually.Ive also driven out a few times but I will not drive during peak hours  if I have to drive out Ill leave after  so by the time I hit LA the traffic is decent and leave work around  PM when the  starts clearing a bit. But even then the traffic tends to be hit and miss if they take a while to clear an accident it can cause major headaches for hours.As for your situation a monthly Metrolink pass from Baldwin Park to LAUS runs . You would need to transfer to Metro Rapid  at Union Station and your total trip would remain about the same  youd have to catch the train at Baldwin Park at  AM and you would arrive at Avenue of the Stars amp Constellation at  AM. But on the bright side you wouldnt need to worry about gas or cursing at other idiot drivers.If you want to try the bike suggestion per uchrsty you would actually be better off riding municipal buses with an EZ Transit Pass which runs  for a Zone  pass that includes the Silver Line. It would take  hr  minutes to reach Culver City station which is a minute ride from Century City When Expo Phase II opens up you could get off at WestwoodRancho Park station which is even closer  although the total time spent would be about the same since youd be on the train about  minutes longer and biking about  minutes less.,LosAngeles,cwvx5dp,12,t5_2qht0

Allow me to translate Its a disappointment that taxpayer money will be used to pay for the settlement as opposed to the civilian model being that each driver is responsible for their own driving by paying an insurance company to cover these costs and raise their rates accordingly.  This disenfranchised individual likely has no means to handle a large sum of money like that in a way that would help them such as a bank account knowledge of obtaining safe and affordable housing health insurance etc because they are on the street. The money would more than likely be spent on nonessential items and quickly.   The reason they are on the streets in the first place is probably due to insufficient public resources like proper education mental health care job assistance and because of this they have been left to solve these issues themselves by other means sleeping on the street pan handling and self medicating by drug and alcohol abuse.

A large part of the Silver Lines success is that it provides a similar level of service to Metro Rail lines which is why it gets to be shown on the Metro Rail map alongside all the rail lines. But San Pedro will receive much less service than the rest of the Silver Line more akin to a regular bus line not shown on the Metro Rail map... such as the .Simply put if Metro puts the San Pedro extension on the Metro Rail map without finding a way to communicate its limited service a thinner line? theyll be writing checks they cant cash. Theres going to be some new riders on a weekend who see the extension on the map and decide to take the bus not realizing that they might have to wait up to  minutes for a bus taking them to San Pedro to show up because in what world does someone show a line that only runs every  minutes on a metro map?Yeah this really bugs me.,LosAngeles,cxib7ke,13,t5_2qht0

On the way enjoy the wildflowers and poppies. Fill up on Mexican food. East coast Mexican food is total crap. Try different varieties of Mexican food too. Its not just about tacos. Go try Oaxacan Michoacan and other regional varieties.  Go into Little Bangladesh and Little Ethiopia and try their cuisines. Not sure where youre going to on the East Coast but I doubt they have a Little Bangladesh nearby.  Go into the Valley and go hiking in the Angeles National Forest. There are a lot of pretty trails and waterfalls and rivers.  Drive up to OxnardVentura and get some fresh right of the field strawberries. Theyre the most delicious strawberries ever and theyre CHEAP. Besides its fun to see how rural it is just right outside of LA Drink Horchata. Always ask for samples if restaurants make their own Try Peruvian Salvadoran and Guatemalan restaurants.   Go to Tommy Burger and get a chiliburger Go to Catalina Island and go kayaking snorkeling diving or whatever you like.  Enjoy the last of your time in LA.

6147374,0,t3_3zr8n1,Hi Mayor GarcettiI am grateful for the moves you and city council have made to improve public transit in this city. I think some of the moves are having a moot effect unfortunately as a result of poor driving and a lack of enforcement of traffic law throughout the city.An example of this is the Bus only lanes drivers not only change lanes into these consistently but also drive in them for the length of a street completely negating the effect that a bus only lane should have. Another issue is the incursion into bike lanes which is incredibly dangerous for cyclists and the total lack of regard for cyclists by drivers in general. Any plans to create more robust enforcement of traffic laws in this city in order to create a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists as well as making sure the laws in place arent flouted at the expense of public transit?Have you considered separated curbed bike lanes on major arteries?Thanks.,LosAngeles,cyoe4i3,13,t5_2qht0

6406693,0,t1_czgpcfo,So your expenses over the life of the car   I extrapolated your .mile fuel cost  purchase price  maintenance  tires  insurance over ten years?  registration over ten years? cost of ownership and operation not counting parking and tollsI realize this is imperfect because I assumed youve had this car for  years based on your mileage and how unbelievably cheap your insurance is. So it probably wasnt that cheap when you first bought it and gas has fluctuated a bit over the last decade.At Metros current monthly pass fare  youd spend  over the same ten year period. But this is only at the current fare structure which only went into place a little over a year ago. The previous monthly pass only cost . So your actual expenses over the past ten years would have been less.So were talking a premium for owning your car of . to . Now you mentioned the value of your time. Thats fair but it also depends on exactly how you value your time. Time spent driving is a loss. Time spent riding can be productive if you choose to make it so. Or that extra  minutes on the bus can be exactly as productive as an extra  minutes at home if all youre doing is watching TV or Redditing when you get home because technology allows us to do those things away from home now.,LosAngeles,czhvjoi,1,t5_2qht0

6455817,0,t1_czmym5g,I dont care myself Im not impacted by it. Theres plenty of parking where I live. Just saying I can understand why streets near Hollywood have permit parking. It drove me crazy when I was  and I felt like it was my right to park in front of some old ladys house because I wanted to meet a date at Johnny Rockets. Now I see it differently. Those people have a right to some normal life on their streets so they can raise a family have visitors etc.    But like I said not my city not my problem.    Guess what though if some randoms just parked on our neighborhood street and starting fouling it up or doing illicit activity it happens in some places Im sure you best believe theyd be moved on before I even had a chance to notice. Im beyond NIMBY. Im NIMFrontY when it comes to unknown people camping where we are raising our kids.  I guess Id be in trouble in Venice quickly and powerless to do anything about it. But then again you should know that comes with the property when you buy it.  But anyway my insignificant opinion aside I think that renters in the area should be entitled to the same preferences. If a street has an apartment building on it it seems strange to have surge pricing that would affect the tenants of that building negatively. Same situation should it be workers for businesses on the street. Some people have more rights in my opinion to parking if thats where they should work or live. Anyway its not law just one random dudes opinion. I do appreciate the interaction and conversation though and I thank you for the discussion.,LosAngeles,czn2oky,7,t5_2qht0

6572489,0,t1_czz4k9b,Well thats her argument but without some concrete numbers its hard to say.  Her place could have amenities that the other tenant will never have.   Do they pay water?   Because if her place has a stacked washerdryer and her neighbor doesnt thats a legitimate rental cost.  But I dont know if that means her rent goes down if that lady dies or moves out.  If shes paying the market rate thats what the market will bear.  The person living in that apartment paid market rate when they moved in too.  When that neighbor moves out the landlord will raise the rent to the market rate not lower hers.  She also has an amenity that she doesnt use that a lot of people in SM would love a parking space.   She could negotiate a lower rent with her landlord if she gave up the parking space and the landlord could rent it out.  Or she could rent it out to offset the cost of her rent.  Im not sure how her lease works but I pay for my parking spot as an extra fee.  If I give up my spot that fee comes off my total rent.   Is her parking space built into her base rent no mattter what?I have no problem saying I dont know enough about this to really assess the situation.

Keep in mind that if your original bills were estimated it is common that the regular reads turn out to be higher than the estimated reads.

Im a security consultantexpert whatever you wanna call it. In order for me to hack your phone id have to be in your vicinity youd have to do something stupid etc. now with a backdoor placed at the OS level of the OSI model I now can do it from where im currently sitting right now before your phone touches your hands you would have already been compromised.Right obviously they can track with court orders but do you want some guy like me also seeing your every move? Do you want some guy like me waiting for you to leave your home activating your camera to see what youre doing and then send someone out to your house to take you for everything while youre away? All this from what TJ.Thats simply not true. Snowdens report did not say there were cameras in every house.Theyre not requesting to brute force they want a free access whenever they want from anywhere in the world the phone was already unlocked when they made a request to install the backdoor theyre just fear mongering to move their agenda of having a backdoor on every phone.Even Mr. John Mcafee said hes crack the one iPhone for them free of charge and they denied stating they already have the phone openunlockedhacked. They just want to put a backdoor on every device out there including phones going to foreign dignitaries. ,LosAngeles,d0b18bw,1,t5_2qht0

6719300,0,t3_47iqzn,Yes. Two gang members robbed my sister while she was working at a bar. She was not a push over and must have been seen as a threat because they shot her twice. One shot from above going down through her forearm into her shoulder then another in the head. They couldnt open the register so took what the police figure amounted to less than twenty dollars in her tip jar. They caught the two guys almost immediately after and one rolled over on the other.  Apparently they had just come from another robbery at a liquor store nearby.  No gun was found. Their fingerprints were all over the register. Neither was charged and they are still free but supposedly out of the state according to police. Been over ten years and still cant get a satisfactory answer as to why they were never charged but apparently it has a lot to do with the weapon not being found. ,LosAngeles,d0ec15x,3,t5_2qht0

In patient would be the best solution. The vast majority of the homeless population have serious addictions that they cant continue and be a part of civil society. Living on the fringes allows them unfettered access to the hardcore drugs and alcohol their damaged psyche desires. Giving them a roof over their heads is merely a temporary solution. We need to combine permenant shelter with medical and psychological care that includes the same rehabilitation treatment that we offer to folks who have been fortunate to have the same drug and addiction problems but have not had all of the wheels fall off their wagon. Giving the homeless a permenant structure or bus that still leaves them in the same environment where they can continue to barely exist in their sickness isnt a real solution. Until one sad day when they die in the streets one more statistic of our failed experiment with treating mental illness and drug addiction as a crime instead of the disease it is.,LosAngeles,d0ythy7,10,t5_2qht0

Its presumed that a FTT will affect every investment account Bernie likes to paint this as a speculation tax targeting wall street fatcats. He conveniently ignores the fact that almost every American will have some kind of retirement account or pension or mutual fund in their life who will see an enormous decimation of capital gains due to a ridiculous bp FTT.

7054809,0,t3_4c8iif,There are a lot of opportunities here  I would suggest ignoring the naysayers.  Ive been here a year and a half and have already worked with Woody Allen and Franco Zeffirelli for four months for LA Opera have filmed a feature film several short films have done Shakespeare in Hollywood Blvd and have built sets at the Staples Center Chinese Theater and other places.  Ive also got an agent and manager.I just met Malcom McDowell on set three days ago and had a wonderful conversation with him about working with Kubrik and Ian Holm at the Royal Shakespeare Theater.Heres the thing though  I came here with over a decade of experience working in smaller markets and I make less than k a month on my craft.  My finances are definitely improving but it has taken a fuckton of willpower to get even to where I am now.Most of my friends who graduated college and came straight here have not worked at all and they are all very very talented.  I chose to go to Seattle and get life and business experience and got a reel and a resume and was able to hit the ground running and its made all the difference in the world. of the people I have met so far have ended up going home either because they ran out of money or because they realized that they dont have what it takes and the competition is INSANE and there is a LOT of it.I honestly think you may be better off if you go to a smaller market for a while and make a name for yourself there and then come here if its still something you want to do.If you MUST come here get ready for a bumpy ride.    You will be borderline or homeless for quite some time...Also look into shared living you will meet a LOT of like minded people and the turnover rate will be high but if you are talanted and can hang on for a while you will meet people in that setting that will be very good friends in the future.  Just be careful though shared living is not for the weak willed...I know several folks who came here to play music that lived with me in shared living and while none of them make a living at it they HAVE played at the former House of Blues Whiskeyagogo and other famous venues while playing the occasional gig and doing a tour or two to SXSW etc.  If that sounds like it would satisfy you may as well give it a shot!  Shared living is very intense and youll see some crazy shit but you will also be able to network with a lot of people from all over the world.Oh and DONT FUCKING DO DRUGS! NO PILLS NO COKE NONE OF IT!!! Once you go down that path GAME OVER!  Im serious about this one!  Ive seen a lot of really cool people go completely off the rail because of that stuff.  Watching others destroy their lives over it has kinda gotten me to quit drinking too.  Ive seen a lot of violence and homelessness caused by substance abuse in my short time here... And it can be easier to get drugs than money in some places in this city...  I can have coke in less than five minutes if I wanted to for free but cant get money for a couple more days.  Be careful...And Im serious I dont care if everyone and their mother is popping pills and doing blow and drinking every day they cant handle it and neither can you.Good luck!,LosAngeles,d1g0sij,8,t5_2qht0

7407135,0,t1_d2k3y1b,But thats still completely unreasonable in a city like Los Angeles especially with the trends that are currently happening. LA was not the same  years ago than it is today so you shouldnt expect it to be the same  years from now.  Building houses doesnt deter people were already seeing that pan out. Because of the spike in house values more investors foreign and domestic buy houses which then drives up the value more creating a bubble. If you bought at k you probably bought within a bubble price which means that if the bubble bursts you could easily be upside down on your house.  Adding housing actually helps the NIMBYs because it stabilizes the market. Sure your house wont gain value at the rate it once did but you wont suffer a bubble burst which could take years to recover from. Traffic is already shit in LA so thats a nonargument. You can either deal with the central LA traffic or move to a less traffic place and sit in freeway traffic to get to work.  So again I say that if you dont want to deal with LA dont buy a house in LA. NIMBYs are being extremely short sighted and shooting themselves in the foot with this.,LosAngeles,d2k55j2,4,t5_2qht0

From FEE.orgAfter many years of confiscatory taxes businessmen desperately needed incentives to expand. By  the top marginal income tax rate was  percent on all income over . We also had a high excessprofits tax that had absorbed more than onethird of all corporate profits since and another corporate tax that reached as high as  percent on other profits.In  and  Congress repealed the excessprofits tax cut the corporate tax to a maximum  percent and cut the top income tax rate to  percent. In  Congress sliced the top marginal rate further to  percent.Those rates were still high but they were the first cuts since the s and sent the message that businesses could keep much of what they earned. The year  was not without ups and downs in employment occasional strikes and rising prices.

7758611,0,t1_d3o17qv,The Huffington Post had a cant believe Im saying this much better article confirming the events with the policegt Santa Monica Police Lieutenant Saul Rodriguez confirmed to The Huffington Post that they arrested yearold Michael Hsu on charges of intent to commit rape and drugging with the intent to commit rape. He is being held on  million bail and his arraignment is on Tuesday Rodriguez said. gt He said that three witnesses reported seeing the man put an unidentified substance in a womans drink.gt We appreciate those witnesses came forward Rodriguez said. It could have prevented a serious crime from taking place.Parts of the Facebook post seem obviously embellished but it looks like the general outline of what happened is true though innocent until proven guilty of course etc. etc.,LosAngeles,d3o3f1q,31,t5_2qht0

7852326,1,t1_d3ylvoi,Why is condom usage fine in the gay porn industry but everyone is freaking out for straight porn?  I also dont understand why the porn industry would fight this.  Make no condom sex more unique with stricter requirement and sell the videos for higher prices for people who want to see bare sex.  And for the rest use condoms and promote themselves as an industry who fights for safe sex and health stuff.  They both get to look good in the community and make money off of it.  It seems like a winwin? edit to be clear I personally think that condom use in porn should be promoted.  It can have public health benefits and I think we should be just as comfortable with reality as the fantasy.  Just as many hardcore videos have interviews with the performers to show that they were consensual and enjoyed what may have looked like harmful interactions condoms should be a fact of life and something that we are used to seeing.  All of these safety measures are a part of sex and That doesnt mean I support the voting measures. I dont think they are the correct method towards the promotion of condom usage in porn.  ,LosAngeles,d3yo6q1,-5,t5_2qht0

But that isnt what is represented in porn. Moreover many people are not involved in a monogamous relationship and many people are also not STD tested.Just because you morally disagree with my post does not make my post a moral argument. Because of the prevalence of STDs and unwanted pregnancies I think that our society should promote condom use in as many avenues as possible. ,LosAngeles,d3z7vrn,0,t5_2qht0

I seem to recall that this task was finished roughly  minutes after the call time.It takes  minutes to sit everyone down tell them a schedule take questions pass out a form and collect them. Thats an indication of how the day will go.The good news is that you get a long lunch and downtown is beautiful for walking. You can hit food trucks and sit in the park for a bit. If you are a brisk walker you can get as far as Grand Central. Bring a floppy hat sunblock and walking shoes.There is a cafeteria on the lower level and you get a break first thing after doing paperwork. Not great food but you can get decent and cheap eggs sausage and such. So theres no need to rush breakfast or coffee... just roll out of bed and head in. Everything is casual in the big room where you wait to be called. Laptops and phones are fine. See other peoples comments about power.If you get called you first sit in a hallway and you can use devices there. When you go into the courtroom things get more formal and I believe I recall a no devices rule. Aside from that there is no guessing what to expect. It depends on the cases that day. Sometimes getting called into a room is your fastest ticket back home! Last time I was there I was called into a room at am and told to expect a day case. A few people managed to get themselves removed for example the judge let a student go on the condition that he reserve after exams.

Our agency the Los Angeles Fire Department LAFD is not directly involved in the lease and has never performed a formal analysis of the aircraft or its abilities.

It does have superwalkable areas like Santa Monica but they arent ethnically diverse.To know the nearby neighborhoods by PDR Id look at My quick takes PdR  MdR arent doing to be dense enough or diverse enough for you Venice is gentrifying fast and is expense but is still diverse in areas and walkable.  Check it out and see what you think. Culver might be a good choice though its recently become more for families looking for a good school district Palms doesnt have so many walking streets but might otherwise be right for you. Westchester is becoming much hotter. Inglewood has traditionally had a bad reputation but there are many great things about it and its changed without being yuppified.

Maybe the NC can invite the bars management to a meeting or send them a letter indicating that there have been complaints.This is what I mean by laziness. People would rather fight a bars right to exist than do the legwork of making calls writing letters or attending meetings to make these types of complaints. And if you dont do that how are the police going to know its an issue? How is the bar going to know its an issue? You have to help people do their jobs properly.,LosAngeles,d6ildqr,1,t5_2qht0

Which private sector industries are partnerships found? DO you think coding specifically web and app development should be a focus? I think it should because that will truly liberate them. I remember when I had to get my piss tested I used to see brochures on the wall for job placement for people with records...but they were horrible jobs with no way to advance their career.. Do you know if you have a record you cannot get financial aid for school i think that should be lifted.. If anyone needs financial aid its the ones with the records. Besides working with private sector and colleges why dont you work with government jobs like the post office city treasurer etc.. and have them eliminate the box.. ..

8768538,0,t1_d71osvf,Well you were saying that self expression is only protected in the form of political speech which I found to be quite odd.  Like if I wore a shirt that said I enjoy anal sodomy surely youd agree a cop couldnt arrest me or force me to turn it inside out for wearing it on a public street and youd probably also agree that isnt political self expression.  You are on the right track when you disagreed that people can speak anytime anywhere and in any way.  Certain specific viewpoint neutral time place and manner restrictions are permitted by case law  think blocking traffic ... the reason for restricting the speech is not because of its viewpoint but because of the place and manner it is being spoken.Believe it or not a man can feel pretty confident that wearing a Zorro costume to the airport is going to be ok.  This man was detained because the officers wanted to determine whether the sword was real in a place where the presence of weapons is a pretty high alarm possibly illegal for open carry Im not a weapons laws expert.  In any event he was detained not arrested and once he was determined not to be a threat he was let go.  Whether his brief detention had to do with fitting a suspect profile or was a Terry stop stop and frisk for contraband if reasonable suspicion of illegal activity but not full search without probable cause it was likely not a violation of his free expression rights if under those circumstances.This is a very brief explanation of a very complicated issue and even the facts of the LAX situation arent very well disclosed by the outlets Ive studied so if theres more to it it could change things.  In any event my point was simply that only certain viewpointspecific speech restrictions are allowed and many viewpoint neutral restrictions must pass a constitutional test to determine if the restriction is an appropriate time place or manner restriction.,LosAngeles,d71qc1u,2,t5_2qht0

I typically pass these people but of course if theres a slowdown they end up right behind me.For some people this threshold might be lower say ft.  These are the people who cut in front when you leave a safe driving distance.

8800321,0,t3_50noy3,I believe this is based on a few things. The smaller the town the more people know you. If you dont pick up your dogs poop or litter once and someone sees you the whole town knows in a week. Your mom calls and tells you to stop embarrasing her your neighbors wont talk to you anymore your coworkers look at you funny and you decide it is a better idea to pick up the poo. In a metropolis everyone is a stranger and there are zero consequences for burning bridges or refusing to cooperate collectively chances are you will never see that person again.People get used to not having to answer to anyone it goes to their head eventually they see having to cooperate as a part of the community as a loss of rights and angrily defend them.The other thing at work is a feeling of disinvestment. A lot of people feel like they dont have anything. They dont own their houseapartment they may move many times in their life so they are just temporarily in whatever community and not a permanent part of it. People take care of their own stuff. If your neighborhood isnt yours or even worse belongs to an oppressive system that systematically keeps you poor and oppressed fuck that why should you care about some poo and trash the man can clean it up and you might as well be walking trash yourself as far as they are concerned.

If Metro had the means they wouldnt be asking for another tax.   Means applies to wealth and money not voters.   Voters are not means.

8992048,0,t3_53fdqo,Its sort of a thing.When I lived in Chicago so what do you do? was sort of a discussionmaking opener when you met somebody. It didnt mean any more than whats your sign?.Los Angeles is under constant invasion by climbers. They arrive from someplace like Peoria. They want a reality TV show. They want to climb. They go to a party and want to meet the guy who knows the guy who booked the guy on Big Brother .When I came to Los Angeles I stopped asking people what they do. I dont remember how long it took for this to occur to me. But when you ask somebody what they do as an opener they automatically assume you might be a climber. So I talk to people about anything else.... good things to eat music anything. If we get along and have demonstrated to the other that we are not climbers then we eventually get around to what sorts of stuff we do professionally. My impression of D.C. based on friends who have lived there is exactly the opposite. Climbing is encouraged and nothing to be ashamed of. People have told me that people walk up to them at parties ask what they do and then walk off when they realize this person is of no professional interest.,LosAngeles,d7speo9,13,t5_2qht0

9005159,0,t1_d7tydc7,I love KXLU and all freeform radio but the other main problem with it freeform radio as a whole I mean is that what you end up hearing is  based on the DJ whos on at that time. For example only a couple weeks ago I was driving to work in the morning with a massive headache and had . on like normal and whoevers show it was I never found out as Ill explain later... thought it would be a good idea to play a  minute track off the new Swans record... so I listened to that shit hoping it would end but it never did until I literally was pulling into the parking garage at work and then dude decides to go straight into some other drone track without a single talk over... like what? Who even are you? And if I couldnt recognize the superlong track you just played was the new Swans which I was only vaguely aware of even existing and actually liked it how would I ever find out? Therere certain rules associated with being on FM my dude and one of those is that most listeners tune in for  minutes at a time at most so you break your sets up like that... Im not trying to hate too much on whoever it was that did that my main point is that freeform college radio isnt always what you want to hear at the moment and if you randomly dial into it and hate whatever is playing it might turn you off from revisiting that station again even though you should since the content changes wildly throughout the day and even if you only listen to the radio on your regular commute the DJ schedules also constantly change. At the same rate youre likely to hear a more varied mix of different styles of music or talk show topics or what have you than you would on any other type of station. And thats the beauty of it. As well as maybe why those stations arent held in as high regard in the days where people can go online and find exactly what they already know they want to hear... But thats boring tune your ear towards hearing something that someonewhocaresmore is volunteering their time towards trying to push on you and you may be surprised at what you take away from it.Source was college DJ for a decade.,LosAngeles,d7ua34f,5,t5_2qht0

I like that approach of further incentivizing primary residence purchasing.  The inverse progressively taxing secondary or tertiary homes would also make it more difficult to snap up property for investment andor rental income.  It would put property hoarders in less competitive positions to make money off rent and the market would eventually price the most egregious hoarders into selling off some properties increasing supply.   No doubt something need to be done because LA has the lowest home ownership rate in the country,LosAngeles,d8e41f6,3,t5_2qht0

9387774,1,t3_595siw,These are horrible measures. After listening to the piece on NPR this morning Im convinced that HHH must fail.The NPR piece talked about how nice these free apartments are. How secure and modern the amenities are. A homeless person interviewed complained about how so many of the homeless who were given free apartments were moving in from other states because the apartments we provide are so nice. Seems crazy that so many in LA are working hard to afford rent while homeless are provided with some of the nicest apartments.The NPR piece talked about the residents of these apartments were spending the afternoon playing dominos in the courtyard. It seems that there is no incentive to look for work. In fact if they did find jobs they could lose eligibility for these free apartments and then they certainly couldnt afford anything as nice.Its too comfortable to be homeless in LA. They dont need an address for their benefits their debit cards get about month automatically deposited every month. The police cant take down their tents or move their possessions away and whatever they beg on the streets is just extra money.The key to solving homelessness is not by creating more rewards and incentive to become and remain homeless. ,LosAngeles,d95yt6n,3,t5_2qht0

His wife was the one who was smart enough to help him unload Griffith Park on the city saving him from a crippling tax burden. She was starting to get fed up with his bullshit so they went on a vacation to the Arcadia Hotel in Santa Monica to try to rekindle their romance. It would appear that things didnt go super well since he confronted her while she was packing them up for their trip home. He forced her to kneel at gunpoint asked her some whackjob questions and then popped her in the eye. She launched herself outta the second story window came crashing down onto the roof of a walkway I believe and then pulled herself through the window of another persons hotel room. So this poor woman with a compound shoulder fracture from the fall and a gun shot wound to the eye socket scrambles in through some strangers window screaming about how her husband has gone crazy and is trying to kill her. The cops show up to find Griffith sitting there drinking whiskey and telling a story about how his silly wife had shot herself in the face while she was trying to pack his gun away.

Some positions take  months before interviews are scheduled due to high volume of eligible applicants. Im currently through the second round according to my friend whos able to check internally. I would not have even made it passed the first round without her directly submitting my resume to HR. From what shes told me the benefits and experience are great but Normal hours do not exist. This means coming into the office at am most days and expected to work on weekends as well. The schedule fluctuates depending on new product releases etc. There have been Sundays where shes up at am to get to the office by  for product testing or prepping for the upcoming week. Of course thats probably not the same for everyone depending on department andor position. My friend started as a contractor and eventually worked hard enough over  months to become a salaried employee. With the company filing for IPO theres been a HUGE surge in applicants.

I thought Hell people put their blinkers on all the time and run to the ATM. Look there isnt even a line this time! Ill be fine. So I park in the red zone run to the ATM.  seconds later I turn around  theres a parking officer full rain getup issuing me a ticket. He hands me the ticket  . Because the red zone was connected to a bus stop so I was blocking mass transit. Los Angeles is an expensive place to be stupid. I learned my lesson.

That complex is probably not actually an affordable housing building rather it has the legally required amount of affordable housing units alloted into it in order for them to legally build.  Developers must stick to insane rules and codes and zoning in order to build here in LA.  The reason these buildings are so expensive to live in is in order for them to actually make their investment back they need to have them be expensive units because of the costly codes and legalities the city imposes on developments.The city has been in the process of rewriting codes so that it will be EASIER to build less expensive units.

You need to fix both before youre  again.Not if while focusing on your papercut your bones heal improperly because you didnt get that injury set.Also papercuts arent that bad.  Point is  the cost of rounding up  million far exceeds any lost tax revenue.  gt  of the population does matter. I would rather focus on the  vets that need homes and set them up for life with my tax money than to those who want a free ride and who cheat the system.Theres plenty of money in the defense budget to take from to help those Vets.  Theres no need to persecute a subset of the population thats also struggling in the name of lifting up another struggling subset. Illegal immigrants arent here for a free ride and they arent interested in cheating the system.  If given a path to citizenship they take it. gt Handing out citizenship to those who illegally entered degrades the meaning for those who fought to get here and deal with our immigration shit.No it doesnt.  They still have to deal with the same immigration shit just after theyve arrived.  No big deal.  gt How many illegal aliens would you say spend money on luxury goods?The economy is moved by all spending.  Not just the wealthy spending money on luxury goods.  gt Things that arent staples how many do you think send money back home to their families? Plenty.  But many also travel and spend money overseas many order from websites and companies overseas.  Many employ millions overseas.  Why are you complaining about some poor illegals sending back chump change to developing nations when youve got immeasurably wealthy corporations stashing trillions overseas?gt The money they make here goes to bread crumbs and shitty living situations. Most leaves the United States tax free.And thats not really a big deal.  All societies will have burdens and as far as people go illegals arent the worst burden.  At least many of them are still working to make money and theyre spending it.gt Obviously Im not going to change your view and you wont change mine but I feel its important to have a conversation with the otherside.Youve bought into fearmongering and you assume illegals are a greater problem than they actually are.  gt Side note no need to downvote people.

It doesnt matter if some people step foot into the country before finishing the paperwork.  Just extend it to them like everyone else.  gt and when they are there they can apply.if they are criminals theyll be deniedAll this works without an utterly useless and wasteful wall and needless persecution of those already here.gt and if someone whos been denied tries to sneak in on their own the wall can stop them along with the boder patrol and all the most modern technology we have to stop the bad hombresIf someone wants to be here badly enough a wall wont stop them. gt and hey... nice poem but just because some lady wrote a poem a century ago that hardly means we cant have a selective immigration policy.Empty response.  The poem was written awhile ago but its still there on the Statue of Liberty and its stood for American values for generations.The reason our country grew as much as it did was because of our open immigration policy.

Although this is a sad situation for the family of this man we must look at the fact this he broke the law TWICE.The fact that millions of Americans get arrested for DUIs doesnt make it OK for him to do so even if it was years ago. There is a legal process for immigrating to another country ours included and he decided that he just wouldnt bother with that. Now he has to face those consequences and thats just that. Every country has a right to protect its sovereignty why is it inhumane for us to do so? Mexico does it I cannot go into Mexico without getting a  day visa at the port of entry. I cannot own land in Mexico under my own name last I checked in  and I cannot overstay my visa and do as I wish down there like drunk driving or disorderly conduct without facing some consequences.Lets not forget that these laws have been in the books for ages they are just being enforced now more than before. Is it awful that these families are being torn apart? Yes of course. Is it OK to think that its OK to do what you want without facing consequences? No of course not.

Immigration officials harass and abuse illegal immigrants on their southern border and more often than not even condone criminal gangs activities abuseexploitation of these same immigrants as long as they get their bribes.The United States has a legal way of migrating here use it like some people have and youll have not issues like these. My family did it the right way and so did my wife and weve never had to live as nervous wrecks wondering when our day would come. I have no sympathy for the man only for his poor family who now have to deal with the consequences of his actions.,LosAngeles,dei5vfr,11,t5_2qht0

11030872,0,t1_dei4rsr,Whats sad is you actually believe the crazy voices in your head that are telling you to mindlessly kill.  The greatest threat to democracy and a free society are stupid people who shoot first and ask questions later.  Its like all youre looking for is any excuse to engage in violence against someone while referencing this incident as an excuse for your actions which is precisely why I called this a PR stunt.  Youre proving me right?We live in a country where there are laws called civil rights.  And part of these laws require that due process be followed regardless of the crime.  We ask questions first and often everyone is a suspect then when we have all the evidence we prosecute.  You clearly have no idea how many wrongful prosecution cases there are out there.Clearly you lack the capacity to control your anger which is now flying out of control and In my direction.  You are overly emotional and a danger in my opinion which makes you a person of interest.  You sound like a professional agitator one of many interesting transplants California seems to have acquired over the past few years.My advice would be to get off the internet for a while go smoke your weed and calm down.  You arent rational.  Just because people disagree with you doesnt make them whatever demon word you have conjured in your mind.

No effort was even made to get a single permit.To celebrate the placement he roasted a whole pig up there then left the uneaten parts out to rot in the open air since the structure didnt have refrigeration.He left the place unattended for months at a time to the point that the windows were broken out anything of value was stripped away and the Clover th. Street amp Happy Valley gangs would frequent the spot.In Los Angeles if you leave a dwelling unattended for extended periods of time and it falls into disrepair you can be charged for it. The city for months warned Rinehart that he had to properly get permits and secure the place if it was to be left attended.He ignored them which was why L.A.s Building amp Saftey Dept. cited him for abandoned or vacant building open to the public and recommended criminal charges be filed.Rinehart put up an unsecured shipping container at the top of a hill thank goodness there wasnt a big enough earthquake to have it slide off the hill without even try to go through the proper channels left it unguarded for months at a time to the point it became a public nuisance and didnt even acknowledge the citys efforts to solve things until the press got involved. That is why I think he should be severely punished.,LosAngeles,dg4g135,4,t5_2qht0

Lets see if Mattis can endure Trumps bs long enough to get it done. THAT is a tough one. As soon as Trump feels threatened by Mattis life will become a pain the ass for Mattis. If Trumps skin was any thinner he wouldnt have any. Saying that Trump is smarter than Bush is setting the bar pretty low. Also calling Obama the man child compared to Trump? It is to laugh. Im no fan of Obama but he is definitely a grown up. Trump never had any reason to grow up so I doubt that he has. Hes spent his life being indulged by the people he surrounds himself with. I think its a job requirement to work for him. I think hes a childish jerk but thats just my opinion of him.  Any man who thinks he can at will walk up to any woman he meets and grab her pussy with impunity is no man that I would call an adult. Or a man with any sense of morals or decency. It also points to a man with low ethical standards. Like I said summer man. Ill give him till summer to show some sign of figuring out what hes going to do. I just hope the Republic survives it.
