I feel that if someone is genuinely confused lonely depressed truly reaching out to someone he feels he might share a bond with that he wouldnt need to clarify that though it may seem creepy he is not being creepy. This insistence raised red flags. I also will add that after recalling this I searched his name and email in google and found at least two obituaries of  year old boys in different states than him where he commented on the funeral pages saying to the parents I grew a loving relationship with your son over facebook and will miss him just as you do.

127878,0,t1_ceswk2z,Hey yeah actually. I left uni for the Christmas holidays on the th of December and still havent been back. However last week a friend of ours saw Joaquin walking by our university. Gabi went in to ask why he was there as she thought hed been suspended and they confirmed that he has been completely removed from the course. Hes obviously not allowed to live in our house so we werent sure what he was doing in that area. A few days ago Gabi saw him dancing in the street again by the uni and ignoring people who out of concern asked him to move. He didnt see her as she ran off scared. The police havent contacted us at all but his parents came to pick up his things before I went home for Christmas. As far as I know he is on bail and cant leave the country so they left him here and went back to Spain. Our landlord called Gabi two days ago to say that Joaquin has been committed to a mental hospital. I dont know any of the details surrounding it but Im just glad hes getting help and isnt in public any more...

270425,0,t1_cf8rvnf,Lol in the last line I said maybe it was bullshit.  Im not sure.  The guy was tiny and looked like he could have been blown over by a stiff wind.   Also wasnt my pal he was just some random card dealer in a run down casino telling a story.  As for the general walking home.  Who knows?  Its not like everyone is going to do murder because its available.  This isnt a movie after all.  Youd be surprised what people will endure before resorting to murder.  It reminds me of a friend recently after watching Django that complained why the slaves didnt just kill the white masters and run away all the time.  Youd have to assume that it wasnt as easy as that and maybe thats why the guys ran away and never looked back.The only reason why I think it might be true is because after awhile he just ignored us and kept going on about it like he was talking to himself and seemed to be getting unhinged.  Like he genuinely seemed disgusted that he could smell the generals bad breath.  Not that the throat slashing was disgusting but that this guy was so dirty that even his lungs smelled bad.   The story was over but he just kept talking about it to himself till the next dealer came then he seemingly snapped out of it and went back to being some cheerful dealer.  Also Im not sure Id categorize his actions as being cool.  He was a kid that was driven to murder then ran away from his family.,LetsNotMeet,cf8sfz9,9,t5_2t3t8
273477,0,t1_cf913nn,Knives are not recommended unless you know how to defend yourself with a knife. You have to be at close range in order to use one and an inexperienced person easily has their own knife turned on them.A better weapon is a big blunt object. Baseball bats crowbars hell the leg of an old chair. Whatever. You can swing it once from at least a couple of feet away and land a damaging blow without actually having to come in contact with your assailant.

323947,0,t1_cfeciuf,ampampamp Survival of the fittest sfw gtgtSurvival of the fittest is a phrase that originated in evolutionary theory as an alternative but less accurate way of describing the mechanism of natural selection It is more commonly used today in other contexts to refer to a supposed greater probability that fit as opposed to unfit individuals will survive some test.gtHerbert Spencer first used the phrase after reading Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species in his Principles of Biology  in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwins biological ones writing This survival of the fittest which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms is that which Mr. Darwin has called natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.gtDarwin first used Spencers new phrase survival of the fittest alongside natural selection in the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in  intending it to mean better designed for an immediate local environment. gtgtImage i  Herbert Spencer coined the phrase survival of the fittest.Interesting ROH Survival of the Fittest | Survival of the Fittest The Headhunters album | Survival of the Fittest amp Kleins Story | Joust  Survival of the Fittest uKilladelphian can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfecjx oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfecjx.

576805,1,t1_cg5tj56,Well thats simply unfair wouldnt ysay? should everyone operate by that particular philosophy nobody would get any votes nobody would read any of them and the entire process would be rendered completely pointless. You people are almost unanimously imposing your point of view on everyone else thats fascist crap folks. simply because you dodo not find a particular topic or subject creepy does not give you the right to impose that point of view upon the rest of us.Im deathly afraid of zombies simply because Im told they are not real and thus are not creepy andor scary does not alter the empirical fact that some convoluted portion of my psyche is horribly adverse to them.Different people hold different opinions have different likesdislikes and different fears no one has the right to say they are or are not valid.Also an event that happens to you personally may be incredibly frightening when viewed from the third person can be construed as far less so it doesnt invalidate the experience. Sorry for pitching in were I slightly more sober I wouldve bit mtongue and kept quiet however I am not so there is my two pence.

613986,0,t1_cga210b,well to be completely honest... the male friend I was watching the movie with then j showed back up was in fact m ex boyfriend. The same one I had been texting about our dog. We are still friends to this day and all of this happened like  years ago... so when he came over that snowy day to pick up our dog Riley he stayed for a while an watched a movie. For the record we broke up because we both wanted to see other people and he had already started banging a really beautiful  year old he was like  or something... classy I know. So we werent trying to rekindle anything. We were just friends. So we here the bang on the window and Brian my ex just looks at me with a look that I can only describe as saying hes about to die without him having to say a word. He runs out the back door and follows Js footsteps in the snow to the front of the house. Brian pulls his knife out and tells J that if he doesnt leave that hell make him leave. I should mention my parents were like parents to Brian so the whole thing J pulled was definitely enough for Brian to freak out like a man protecting his family. J eventually left and called the cops. Brian got called in to court for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon or some such thing. Brian and his new girlfriend picked me up the morning of the court date along with my dad. We went to court and testified on Brians behalf explaining what had happened. I brought in a recording of Js voicemails from that night and a photo of the broken door frame. My father and I were asked if wed press charges against J. We did. And all charges against Brian got dropped.,LetsNotMeet,cga28gu,7,t5_2t3t8

831576,0,t1_cgyhrpd,Almost. His behavior was inappropriate because she was made uncomfortable with it.All interaction is give and take and whether or not what your doing is okay depends on how the other person feels about it. Which is why social interactions are a series of baby steps. When you encounter a new person and you flirt with them and they flirt back it is okay to continue flirting. If they dont reciprocate you should stop.Now some people are dense and cant pick up subtle social cues. Thus you might need to tell a creeper to back off. If they do they are just dumb. If they dont it becomes sexual harassment. To make it easier to understand imagine taking the sex out of the equation. If you sit down with a good friend and say hi and they unload about their bad day thats not weird. It would be weird if the same thing happened with a stranger on the bus. Because the stranger doesnt have that relationship with you They have not taken the first relationship steps they jumped right into good friend without seeing if the other person wants to be good friends.So ask if you are far enough into the relationship to act the way you are acting? Ask them directly. Are you not comfortable asking directly? You arent far enough into the relationship.TLDR She didnt tell him to leave her alone not sexual harassment.

1444387,0,t1_cixatrg,Well personal responsability is a very controversial and complicated topic.If you spend some time to think on human behavior you might notice that were extremely predictable. So then there comes the question of acting accordingly to a choice that is still pending a choice thats not yet a fact but a possibility. What complicates it even further is that since the choice is not yours in the first place the first reaction would be to dismiss it. After all the other party should be responsible for its own choices right?But then given the rigidity of behavior I mentioned earlier they dont actually have a proper control over their own choices it will be for the most part a question of habit context and brain activity.So we can assume their expected choice is a priori. Much like you expect children to do some stupid things and you prevent them from doing so so that they dont harm themselves in the process. You might say were adults but depending on each ones difficult past we have quite limited choices most of which do not benefit us. Whats even more detrimental is that the prefrontal cortex  the area of the brain responsible for decisions matures at . So although were considered adults by law at  we are not adults in decision making. When you pair those two together past experiences  that form our views and prefrontal cortex maturity you get a nasty cocktail of erraticstupid decisions. Yes theyre still ours but the question is was the decision up to us entirely?So if she believes shes good for sex  and choses accordingly to her beliefs  and this is exactly what you do with her this reinforces a very bad pattern.Thats why I mention that theres some degree of responsibility on your behalf and thats why i asked for the age first.I never mentioned you should feel guily this is also something only you did. I just mentioned responsability for engaging in the first place.I wouldnt want to make it sound like this is all bad we never know. In fact since she lowered the bar on age  and if youre the only younger guy she sexed that might be considered as progress on her behalf and on what she feels confortable with and feels appropriate. Getting with you might have been a bridge between her sexual distorted past  y old  manybe grandfather to a more grounded view. But then again I dont know all the details. And this nice hypothetical ending still does not remove your end of how you act from now on towards people.Now as to what you could or should do with this case in particular the responsability line gets even more blured. I for one try to make a difference in someone elses life if i can and know about it I try not to overcomplicate this decision too much. You cant save her per se only she can. But if shes unaware of her condition she wont have any point of reference as of what wentgoes wrong in the first place.,LetsNotMeet,cixbw6w,1,t5_2t3t8

I dont mean that sarcastically. Im open to other arguments.I also dont think its fair to say that it must be tumblr feminists downvoting a comment that is a blanket statement in which the OP didnt even provide sources to back it up.

2580262,0,t3_2pafyc,This reminds me of an incident my friends and I had years ago in an abandoned house. We used to search abandoned houses for junk. I even got a sweet portrait of a city from one of them. Well one day two of my buddies and I found an abandoned house that was pretty big so we thought wed check it out for items and maybe hang out have a few drinks. So we go inside at night and do our searching. While were down stairs we begin to hear chanting coming coming from the upper floors. We were like Wtf. We decided to sneak up the steps and see what was going on. The chanting was coming from the furthest room and the door was closed. We could see dim lighting from the crack underneath the door. My friends and I are creeped out but we cracked jokes trying to make ourselves feel at ease. But all of a sudden the chanting stops and I swear to you a womans voice calls out in the creepiest voice ever come in. It was creepy as Fk. We noped out of there. One of my friends said he looked up at the bedroom window from the outside and saw women in black staring at us but I dont know if he was telling the truth. I thought he was just messing with us.,LetsNotMeet,cmvdlvy,46,t5_2t3t8

The town was near a Marine Corps base and the last thing you want is a bunch of Marines doing a witch hunt.  I wasnt tramatized by the experience.  I didnt sleep that night and about  weeks later we moved away.  I think the reason I was not traumatized was because since an early age I was taught to be tough.  My dad is a former infantry officer.  Since I was little he taught us self defense he learned in the service along with the wrestling and boxing he did in high school and college.  He also taught us how to use firearms and knives.We were taught how to defend ourselves from an abductor.  I felt like that kept me from panicking.  I had a knife with me when I visited that cave.

And like I also said several times I think the mods and authors revel in fooling people into thinking the story is real.

3761604,0,t1_cqksolw,Thank you ucandlesticksnape I really do appreciate your response as it did give me pause to look at how Im coming off to people and I think Ive been harsh and curt. I do see the difficulty that youve raised regarding a sub like this so maybe its my attitude bad thats problematic because Im an asshole to creeps and generally dismissive and disdainful of their existence so it takes a lot more than catcalls or social awkwardness to scare me.I WAS the yr old hot school girl that had creepy dudes honking at me and driving up even approaching me face to face and following me. Ive also had a stalker and he is the reason I live behind a gate have caller ID and hate people. YES I felt some kind of way in those situations and would like to share those experiences one day but I wont do it here because my point remains that THIS sub isnt the place for that. My intention was not to trivialize anyones experience only to suggest that maybe they belonged elsewhere. I just wanted to find a happy medium that worked for everyone where the readers of the sub still get their terrifying shit while less scary stories including my own still have a place which provides an outlet for those who want to share.The solution that I believe will work for everyone is that Ive made a new sub. That sub now is linked on the sidebar here and all mildly creepy encounters can go to the new sub rcreepyencounters there instead of clogging up the gooey goodness posted here.

Im thinking you may have went onto someones private property and they put down nails or something to pop tires and discourage people from coming back. Its not that uncommon. Some people even string thing wires across trails to clothesline atv riders.  Also have you ever stabbed a tire? Its loud and quick.

4186367,0,t3_37uolc,Its sad that stuff like this happens because Ive been in situations where I was the one asking for help... and in most cases received it. One time Id overstayed at a restaurant due to a pushy aunt who basically forced me to stay with her until she was finished while everyone else left earlier. I went to pay the bill afterwards she told me to keep the change... of which there was none so I had to throw in my just in case cash to pay it all! and while I was busy she drove off without me my purse and mobile in the back of her car! yeah not my favourite aunt  It wasnt too late summer around ish so I figured some stores would still be open and being in rural Australia decided to leg it to a nearby store and see if theyd let me use their phone. Unfortunately theyd just shut and werent about to let in someone who could be a potential late night customer fair enough  Ive worked retail I know how much that sucks so I hung around until one of the women came out and begged a phone call I know a bit creepy but what could I do? I lived in a whole other town and had no friends nearby as well as no money for a taxi. She was reluctant but I tried not to take long and thanked her profusely afterwards then had to wait for about half an hour until my mum came and got me. I returned the next day with chocolates as a thank you though the lady wasnt working that shift so I left them there but yeah it sucks being in the position of not wanting to creep people out but needing help.I seem to find myself in that position a lot though sadly. gt.lt Im always really grateful to those who do help because I think about it and how easily they could be taken advantage of and its just horrible that people would do that to others  especially good people who try to help.I dont blame your friend  shes obviously good people  but that woman and her friends... lets just say I wish them all the karma returned fold.,LetsNotMeet,crxg4an,2,t5_2t3t8

4248191,0,t1_crvbi0p,Another rule of thumb dont pick something you dont have to room for to wield. The baseball bat is an excellent example for this its very favored as a selfdefense weapon but unless you have to room for a horizontal or vertical swing its actually a pretty mediocre weapon. Doubt you can bunt someone hard enough with it to do anything beyond make them even more angry.Something else to keep in mind if you have a long narrow hallway or something a throwing weapon can also be very effective as the perp wouldnt have a lot of room to dodge the projectile. Steak knives are a decent choice for this as youll probably have a few of them and they are decent at cutting flesh. Something like bear spraymace with a lot longer range also perfectly legal in all of the US is also very effective here.,LetsNotMeet,cs4hflu,1,t5_2t3t8

4299000,0,t3_3a021v,Few musings about LNM and this post on a Wednesday nightEvery omnibus thread such as this one should have no fewer than  upvotes. They consistently bring topquality and often forgotten posts back into the fold and cheers to insanemystics post for doing so with this thread. I hadnt read pokerface before and I am grateful it was bumped. We need to have threads like this every so often especially in light of the boards recent slump. I am disappointed that the highest rated post of all time is about a perv bringing out his schlong at a McDonalds. Hardly creepy hardly memorable. How did that net  upvotes?Dr. Ramsey always struck me as imaginative albeit entertaining narrative. Lastly and I wonder if Im alone on this but I feel the best stories are the ones that describe traps and decoys. There is something terrifying about premeditated and meticulously deceptive abduction and stalking practices.

It is not a cult full of demon worshipers who go around slashing familys tires. Im not saying that your neighbors could not have been the culprits or that Wiccans are all perfect wonderful people incapable of doing wrong but only that it may be that the part about your neighbors being Wiccan is a misinterpretation of the religion either on their part or yours. Considering I am one myself behavior such as that is actually quite frowned upon in the Wiccan community. Aside from that though this story is absolutely terrifying!

4653588,0,t3_3e7mz4,I agree with just about everyone here. You need to tell everyone you know about this guy. Tell your friends and acquaintances what hes been doing and insist that if anyone asks them about you that they say nothing.  Tell your coworkers so they can keep an eye out. Tell your neighbors to let you andor the police know if they see anyone suspicious especially someone looking like Jim. Id give all the people I mentioned copies of his picture so they know who theyre looking for.Also since someone brought up the idea of hiring a lawyer but the cost may be too much I wanted to let you know where I live lawyers are required to take a certain number of cases for free a year. If you contact your state representatives office they may be able to help you find a lawyer whod be willing and able to help you pro bono.  If that doesnt work or you want help wording your request you can contact me privately and Ill gladly help you out.You can also threaten blackmail since you surely have his naked pictures too.

We told my dad about it parents divorced he didnt live there and he insisted it had to have just been loose and got looser as we used it. But my aunt had JUST shut and locked the door she would have felt it. So again I really have no idea how they did it. Also Im not sure what the point was as there was still the deadbolt.

You actually came across someone who drove a  Scout International in mint condition! Astonishing. Normally the vehicle of choice is a flatbed Mercury. Ok now for real advice. You should buy a few x boards and x boards of three to four feet in length and keep them in your car. As a photographer these boards will act as solid monopods and will allow you to steady your camera much more effectively than a  stateoftheart name brand aluminum tripod will. As a scared person these boards also serve as defacto weapons.

My CSS mod and I just went through hell and back trying to fix up Nightmode you should check it out its beautiful! lol and are working on a Dark Theme for those that dont have RES so I know all the work that goes into this.. I dont use darker themes much because Im blind as a bat but in looking around the default I noticed three things.The first is that the th and th nested comment areas arent taking the dark color. They are white which can be jarring if youre reading a dark page and all of a sudden scroll to themAlso when submitting a comment the Live Preview box is white which also may be jarring to those using the dark optionLast thing is that Ive noticed the fontsize is noticeably smaller which makes the page difficult to read.Im not on .nm just the regular dark default using FF  RES.

The natural illumination from the moon was a bit more than normal but nowhere near the point that would explain the level of detail they could obviously make out. Its possible that they did have some sort of night vision optics Ive heard of them acquiring relatively cheap camerascamcorders with a night vision mode and using them as crude NODs. NVGs themselves arent all that hard to acquire if youre not worried about bleeding edge clarity and reliability.Without going into too many details one of those later missions I mentioned involved the Rangers getting into a gun battle with insurgents. After it ended they found that the Taliban had been fullyequipped with weapons amp equipment that had apparently been stolen from fallen Force Recon Marines at some point in the past.

5186322,0,t1_cva367g,I do agree its great when people speak out. HOWEVER there are so many reasons not to speak out and one is that it is not ever guaranteed to help. In fact it can be worse if you do sopeople may not believe you and even thereafter bully you you may be fired orand the creep can become more threatening.In other words even if OP said something her coworker could have STILL been assaulted. Not to mention I doubt that OP was the only one who spotted his creepiness and yet that knowledge still resulted in one of the girls getting assaulted. Knowledge didnt help. I dont think anyone should play fortune teller and say that yes if OP said something no assault would have taken place.I think in threads like this when someone could have said something but didnt it is better to reflect on what we could do versus what OP could do. If someone came up to you and said someone was creeping on her or worse what would you do? What would you do as a stranger an employer a coworker a friend a family member? The more victims speak out the less stigmatized doing so becomes and thus the easier it is to do so. This is good. But what is better? That we as a social community believe and support people who speak outits really in our hands to determine that when a victim speaks out she or he is heard and appropriate action is taken.So instead of saying OP you should have spoken up though we get why you didnt and dont feel bad. Maybe we should say OP IF you had spoken up and I was there I would have supported you in such and such a way. And I hope if I am ever in such a situation I will feel empowered by your story to speak out and that people will support me. I just wonder if the more people learn how to stick up for those who speak out the more people will speak out in the first place.,LetsNotMeet,cvb54pj,5,t5_2t3t8

They should have asked for a description or someone go with you to point him out. Thats normal at cons if someone is having an ongoing problem with another person attending. Especially true because youre a minor. If you have a cosplay fan page or are part of any groups on FB or Tumblr Id give a detailed description of this guy and what con it happened at so other cosplayers are aware of him too. You handled everything the right way at the con getting away from him as much as possible letting staff know letting friends know and having those friends with you so you werent alone.

5543628,0,t3_3llwpj,Because this story is current and I just listened to it on YouTube I made an account to share my opinion. If I was you and it was my mother that was being stalked I would make sure that we had motion sensor lights installed around the house so that we know if someone or something is coming up to the property. If you do not currently have an alarm system I would also seriously look into getting one. The feature that simply lets you know which doors  windows are being opened I find to be really reassuring when I am home by myself. If you can afford to have a camera system installed as well that is a plus. I used to work for a locksmith company that specialized in commercial security features including camera systems and I can make some recommendations on brands. Basically the DVR is typically the most expensive feature besides the labor standard cameras for a home environment should be  each IMO so I would put one at each main entrance. The motion flood lights are pretty inexpensive and relatively easy to install yourself but if you are unable to afford a camera system you can get some of the dummy cameras that have the battery powered light on and put up some stickers saying that the property is being monitored and that often deters people. I would still seriously look into an alarm system though and do not be afraid to shop around for price. Some of the large nationwide companies are a ripoff price wise trust me. Also if you guys do not have a dog you should really consider adopting one. I know there are always animals in need of a good home and you all may feel safer with a big fluff ball around to warn you of danger. I also own several guns but I do agree with some of the other comments saying that you cant always rely on being able to get to one in time and if you do not know how to use one or defend yourself there is a good chance it could be used against you. I however also agree with another comment regarding the stolen gasoline. My mind went right to arson. Please make sure you keep all your doors and windows locked and honestly I would make sure that your blinds and curtains are closed especially at night. Please be safe and again if you want any advice on some cameras or anything if you think your mom would go for those please let me know. Also if anything else happens make sure you call the police every single time. I would imagine that you would want to make sure you have everything documented should you discover his identity thanks to someone getting his plates. I hope everything ends up being okay.,LetsNotMeet,cwk8l0h,1,t5_2t3t8

5545773,1,t1_cwkhv92,I only offered a few potential options. There are far more than just the three things I threw out there off the top of my head.I also want to live in a society that helps their fellow human beings. One where you can go out at night which youre right is certainly well within your rights without the fear of being harmed. If I realized someone was scared because they thought I was following them Id do what I could to ease their fears but I wouldnt stop heading toward my destination. I donate blood regularly and offer assistance to people in need frequently including pushing cars out of streets and into gas stations Im fortunate enough to not suffer from the bystander effect because my reaction is instant regardless of the number of people around giving people rides when I can and a variety of other ways of helping. None of that changes the reality that the world is currently a dangerous place and you have to protect yourself because you cant rely on everyone else to do it for you. Ive been conned before and I blamed myself because I fell for it. I didnt start blaming people around me for not keeping me from getting conned.As for your implication that I wouldnt be sympathetic towards someone who had a crime committed against them in your other post youre very very wrong. Just because I question someones choices doesnt mean I dont feel for them when theyve been wronged.,LetsNotMeet,cwki5ur,1,t5_2t3t8

5607570,0,t1_cwqwt27,gt Rape is a crime of power to hold power over someoneUnless it isnt.  Lots of people say this like theyre experts in rape who have done thousands of rapes and so know all about it.  But I dont think there are that many experts in rape around.  I think this is more of a popular myth.  Rape may actually have something to do with lust and sex.All of which is a tangent of course.gt since when do young perverts automatically get the he must be a rapist ... if that is the case when i was young the boys in class would do bra snapping and depantsing things of that nature none of them turned out to be a rapist nor i for that matter....This is different from that type of thing in that the guy was clearly not doing it in a playful social context.  A joker or bully snapping a bra in a school hallway or whatever with people around is probably just being pettily funny or mean.  Theres not much threat of heavier violence in that act.  But an awkward loner approaching with hand down pants in the dark while the girl is possibly asleep and hardly anybody else is around is obviously communicating a much bigger threat even if he doesnt intend to go any further.OP probably has other issues because everybody does.  Maybe she should be scared of men and maybe she shouldnt who knows.  Regardless greasy boy seems to be the main problem in this case.  And its damn easy to imagine him developing into a rapist later.  Of course its also easy to imagine him...  not doing so.,LetsNotMeet,cws690y,2,t5_2t3t8

5627762,0,t1_cwu6jhb,At first I thought it may have been one of the boys in my class there was one in particular who always seemed to follow me around but when the notes got more sexual I ruled him out he was just a sweet awkward boy with a little crush and his grandma always walked him into class and Id find the notes pretty much as soon as I opened my desk. Im  now and when I think about this incident I realize it was most likely an adult I dont really remember any janitors but obviously they were around and I was a friendly polite child so Im if sure he spoke to me I would have stopped and if he had told me to go somewhere with him I probably would have I was safe at school. It still really freaks me out sadly thats not my only experience with something like this.

And thats only because this dude honestly isnt giving me the creepy vibes. I am leaning on the side your number used to be someone elses a relative of his and that he was probably lonely andor had a mental disability. Ive also had something similar happen to me. For a little while I had the same number calling me and leaving me vms. They then started texting me and demanding I answer them. They were trying to get into contact with their daughter who was away at college after a fight or something had happened between them. Weird stuff huh?,LetsNotMeet,czc7obl,-6,t5_2t3t8

6596559,0,t3_45x1ct,I remember going on chatavenue a lot as a young teen.  It was a shady place at times.One girl I met on there on and then talked to on MSN one day sent me a link out of nowhere and being not all that saavy at the time I clicked on it.  It brought me to a blank site and after a few seconds  command prompt looking windows opened and then immediately closed.Thought it was a bit odd but brushed it off as nothing.  After about  minutes or so weird things started happening like browsers minimizing for no reason at all.  Then to my complete dismay my webcam light turned on and I quickly turned it off and immediately opened Task Manager as I thought for sure something was up. Right after opening Task Manager a really strange chatbox opened right on my desktop it wasnt a chatavenue or MSN chatbox.  It was black with green text.  I got a message from ????? just saying hello.  At that point I knew that Id been had and basically asked the person why they targeted my computer even though I knew full well it was related to the link I clicked on.  They just said that they liked me and I was their new friend.  I politely asked them to buzz off and they graciously agreed before saying Nice desktop by the way it was  hot women  bottomless with their backs facing the camera.I did a MalwareBytes scan and there was something that Im sure was the culprit but I cant remember exactly what it was called.  That was the end of it.This person certainly wasnt malicious and I really think that they were just playing around with a new program that they got but either way at the time it really creeped me out.  I called to Microsoft the next day and the tech said theyd never heard of anything like it and thought it was really weird.  Anyway moral of the story dont click on strange links out of nowhere but Im sure all of us know that already.,LetsNotMeet,d01mzrs,9,t5_2t3t8

Obviously I think he needs to seek mental health treatment and if he is a veteran thats a whole different story. But as much as I do feel sorry for the homeless and wish there was a better system for them to get shelter the shelters in the city I lived in were almost worse than living on the street I dont think there is any justification for potentially causing harm to someone else. Especially a seventeen year old. Lying cheating and theft is probably the only way he knew to survive. And thats sad. But again I dont think it justifies anything. ,LetsNotMeet,d03dg5e,3,t5_2t3t8

7236210,0,t3_4e9a2g,I had a good friend  platonic called James.  He invited me to his aunts place where he also lived for tea and scones. I met his aunt briefly. One day James was very upset  he told me his mother had just died in the middle of the night. About  weeks later James aunt went into hospital and was very ill. One time James and I were going out for lunch . James said that he wanted topick up his watch that hed forgotten at home given to him by his late mum. At his place two women were there. James went to his bedroom to get his beloved watch and I got talking to these women .  I discovered that the women were his sisters ! Hed told  me that he only had a brother .  I gave them my condolences for their late mother.  They were horrified and looked at me aghast.  They said that their mother was alive and in hospital .  I was so embarrassed. What transpired is that the woman that James had introduced to me as his aunt was in reality his mother ! I was furious with him! Turned out James had told me lots of lies about his life. Hes not an evil  nasty person. Hes actually a kind  caring  gentle man. But hes a perpetual liar . And lies about pointless things! About  years  a go I bumped into him and he told me that he had prostate cancer and it was stage four and he probably not make it through.  But of course it was a lie  he never had cancer . Hes fit and healthy and very much alive! Some people  especially men ! Ha ha!  are Walter Mitty characters!  They are born compulsive liars . Its like a form of mental illness ! ,LetsNotMeet,d20pdna,1,t5_2t3t8

7352323,0,t3_4g1ryx,I think removing stories that clearly have no creep factor and are based on just a feeling that something mightve happened should be removed. As long as a story is truly creepy it doesnt matter if it was a single event or ongoing. There are a lot of super creepy stories that were a onetime encounter that would be a shame to miss out on. As far as the truthfulness of a story in most cases you cant prove it and I dont think its cool to just accuse someone of lying unless its blatantly obvious. ,LetsNotMeet,d2dwqd0,144,t5_2t3t8
7352456,0,t3_4g1ryx,To me lots of stories can be creepy not just the ones involving an ongoing stalker. Mods remove stories for formatting issues then dont even give an explanation as to why the story wasnt approved. I submitted a story not long ago that Im sure some people would find creepy and the mods didnt approve it after I edited the format yet I see stories on here that are pathetic and never get removed. Mine wasnt just about a gut feeling it was actually something creepy that happened. I think the mods should just let stories that are obviously true pass then let the community decide if its scary enough to stay or not. Not everyone has an experience like the smiling man or dr. Ramsey. Yes we would all love to read those kinds of stories everyday...but if those are the kind of stories you want well sorry to say you might have be lucky to get a story once a month. ,LetsNotMeet,d2dx9zr,7,t5_2t3t8

Theres a story on there right now about how a lady flirted with a guy who had a bad reaction to it.  The guy later became one of the Boston bombers.  It doesnt fit in LetsNotMeet because nothing happened to her but it is pretty darn creepy to find out that someone you thought was normal was capable of something so terrible.The sidebar even says in Rule  Additionally stories that focus on how you knew somebody who did horrible things but not to you are not allowed and will be removed.  I think the I got a feeling about this guy and it turns out he killed somebody stories fit under this umbrella.Dont get me wrong I still want to read those stories.

7378960,0,t1_d2gdeko,I suppose all of us have moments that separate our lives into two halves before and after. I was only homeless for around a month. It was completely my fault. The house I was living in not mine got foreclosed while I was going through a pretty severe bout of depression and instead of making other arrangements I did nothing. You could go back further than that if you wanted. I wrecked my car. Ruined my credit. Was involved in an insanely toxic relationship. It all kind of snowballed and eventually lead to me living in my car.But thankfully Im not homeless anymore. All of that stuff was in the before.

My cat espaced one night and unfortunately I witnessed her almost get hit by a car.  I screamed at the top of my lungs so loud that it made the car stop. The next day I apologized to one of my neighbours for the screaming and they said they didnt hear a thing. There must be a reason why they cant hear anything but I cant figure it out.  Either that or people are so afraid of getting sued nowadays that they mind their own business in fear of getting involved. I saw an episode of WWYD where someone collapsed in the middle of a public street and despite over a hundred people noticing almost nobody came to help.

7836083,0,t1_d3wti0w,Austin resident who voted against Prop  here. Ive have had some pretty sketchy drivers while using both Lyft and Uber but by far the worst experiences were with Lyft. I had two drivers refuse to let me out of the car at the end of a ride. One of them was actually trying to make the ride longer by ignoring me when I told him where the building I was headed to was located and refused to let me out despite my yelling about it three times. The other was trying to negotiate with me and push me into letting him start a new trip since he knew I would get another ride after finishing a quick errand. I had to force my way out of his car. I will say that Lyft was much more concerned and responsive than Uber was about sketchy drivers.,LetsNotMeet,d3wud6v,29,t5_2t3t8

Example there is a room in the basement of my current rental which has in its time been a church a convenience store and an anarchist commune which is stuffed hoarderfull of just everything you can imagine. Musical instruments including a number of guitars and at least one full drum kit old junked furniture giant oriental rugs... and a mattress and its own tiny washroom. It hasnt been slept in recently because the ashtray full of butts by the bedside doesnt smell like anything anymore. We know it is there because there is a hole cut in the wall that one can shine a flashlight through but my exroommate had to break the door down with her shoulder to check it out. Theres also a mostlyopaque window from the tiny washroom to the scary laundry room downstairs. When I moved in it was on sometimes. Also there are metal gates over all the outside doors and I do not even have a key to the one leading directly into the basement.I have no idea.

8542524,0,t1_d69co59,Yeah I read something like that. But Im not sure if the yearold was black or it was a different one? Because from what I remembered the boy was naked and was bleeding from his anus and while he escaped a woman and her child saw and asked what was wrong and ended up calling the cops. Cops came over to Dahmers place Dahmer convinced them that the boy was his lover and in the end the cops left thinking it was another one of those homo quarrel or something. Had they not just searched his place and Dahmer wouldve gotten caught. Dahmer finally gets caught when he tried to lure in a black guy to his place which actually worked guy becomes nervous because Dahmers place reeked with rotten flesh neighbors have called the cops but the cops never searched his place til now. Seriously? Dahmer then ties his hands or something to trap him guy freaks manages to escape tells his friends the people who he was with before Dahmer went up to advertise him about taking nude pics. Cant remember what happened next but when cops came guy tells them what he suspects which is Dahmer being a murder shows them him being tied what he thinkssees Dahmer doing etc cops finally searched has enough evidence and Dahmer finally gets arrested. I think you know this already though!This makes more sense now that you mentioned it! I also thought the same about how they wanted Dahmer to die. Face it if he does get released then hes just going to go out and kill again. ,LetsNotMeet,d69dv45,3,t5_2t3t8

Most of us were paying our own way and didnt have much going for us.As for invading his space the door was open and the room looked ransacked. Our first thought was that someone had broken into his room. I didnt even pass the doorway until I saw the very realistic drawing of my own face on the wall and that was maybe ft inside the door.

However the car could have made him think that they are someone who came to look for you or at least will be able to quickly provide the information on his appearance and the car when someone will actually search for you.

9337024,0,t3_56buut,This actually happened to my girlfriend me and her were out on a date  now we live near the Chicago pier I use the world live because my parents in typical Korean fashion moved me out at the age of  and she stayed at my apartment for about  weeks now being  year olds who are madly in love with sex she would walk around my apartment in skimpy clothing basically she would wear a c cup bra on her DD breast and pajama shorts that squeezed her butt in a perfect fashion and since she loved anal no condoms in a  year olds mind it was heaven on steroids and cocaine what I didnt realize at the time was that my neighbor would walk into the hallway to a big open window in the layout of the chicken he would watch my girlfriend the first time i figured this out was near the end of those  weeks when i got up to get some water and my girlfriend followed me to get a snack since we both felt uneasy because we had an argument that day and she wanted an excuse to talk about it she choose the worst time when i looked out of the window because of the angle of my fridge it would force me to face the window when ever i close it i saw him staring intensely and as soon as we made eye contact he ran away i called the police but they couldnt catch him as he immediately fled the premises that man was never caught but i hope he is getting proper help.Edits English is not my first language but here is some contexct my girlfriend is Swedish and she had a  rare opportunity to come to France where i lived at the time and since we only had  weeks we figured we would make the most out of it and had as much sex as possible i regret this now because i miss her after we broke up last year i just got so attached to her and not for the sex but for how she cared about everyone and would always be optimistic and smile and cheer up my day i miss her always playfully shoving my head in her breast because she new how much i loved breasts and would try and make me feel flustered.,LetsNotMeet,d8zjb40,0,t5_2t3t8

My gran was also the one teaching me how to drive a stick her car was new and I had accidently backed into a little tree. I barely bumped it but when we got home my gran got out to look and she says Oh God! With her hands over her mouth So Im feeling like crap thinking I just ruined the whole rear end of her car.

11670902,0,t3_64uf4n,So glad you got out of that situation relatively unscathed. A similar thing happened to a friend of mine recently while we were all camping after a festival. She was in a tent with another mutual female friend and they offered a friend of a friend to stay there with them since he decided to camp sort of impromptu along with a couple others in their larger group. The figured it was safe since they were a pair in a big tent and they thought that this guy was a vetted part of the group. She woke up in the middle of the night to him grabbing at her and kissing her. When she pushed him off he told her that she was no fun and kept trying to touch her then when she started yelling he told her she was lucky he wasnt an asshole. The implication there makes me see red. They kicked him the hell out of the entire area for sure. These fucking creeps are a dime a dozen ugh.,LetsNotMeet,dgiwv2w,2,t5_2t3t8
