7848880,0,t3_4mtysf,gtWelcome to the ugly side of an unusually vicious presidential campaign season. When Clinton ran in  poised to become the first female president in U.S. history she faced a more subtle brand of sexism. Cable news pundits debated whether or not she was nagging and made jokes about how her voice made men want to cross their legs. This time in part because of the advent of noholdsbarred social media the goal posts have moved. The dogs have eaten the dogwhistle.While Im not going to say that there isnt more hostile sexism directed at Clinton this time around there was still a lot of obvious sexism against her in . It wasnt uncommon to hear someone say stuff like we cant have a woman president because women are too emotional and irrational which is just as bad. ,HillaryForAmerica,d3ya84y,1,t5_37t9f

7857050,0,t3_4mx4i6,The way I think about it is this being a woman inevitably gives you a different set of experiences and perspectives than being a man. Neither is better or worse just different. Its really important to have this diversity in elected officials because you cant solve problems you dont know about. A great example of this is Hillarys position on child care. I dont think Ive ever seen a male politician make this a central part of their platform the way Hillary does even though its an issue that many many families face. And I do think that thats largely due to the fact that women have traditionally been the ones responsible for child care. Theres also some research to suggest that diverse teams are actually the most effective at solving problems so even for issues that arent tied to gender diversity is beneficial.On a related note one thing thats become very clear to me over this election cycle is that its not just positions that matter but priorities. Politicians never accomplish everything on their agenda so which things they prioritize matter. Having women in office and in the presidency in particular means that things like womens issues are much more likely to be a priority than if the government is dominated by men.,HillaryForAmerica,d3z7c0j,3,t5_37t9f

She needs clothes that hold up can handle being worn many times and still look fresh and good make her feel good and photograph decently.  When she was FLOTUS her headbands bangs etc all were scrutinized to the nth degree. She wants people paying attention to what shes saying not thinking that jacket doesnt suit her body. If she spent  on clothes to wear for the campaign or  or whatever and she spent it from her own money I give zero shits about that. She will probably keep wearing most of it throughout her presidency and shell donate to charity what she doesnt wear.No one ever asks men how much their suits cost probably most are wearing suits that are in the k ballpark or about their rolex watch or  shoes or whatever. ,HillaryForAmerica,d3zoffv,16,t5_37t9f

I mean you just have to do just a little bit of effort to understand the connection is not just she was married to someone. I was being very simple and brief but I guess Ill expand.Hillary was probably the most active FLOTUS ever. She had her own team and she challenged Bill on many occasions. Im gonna guess youre not old enough to remember the s clearly because theres no way you were paying attention then and got the conclusion that she was just someones wife. Heres a very evenhanded analysis of her time as FLOTUS which criticizes her quite a bit. Its not biased in her favor at all but youll clearly see she was very powerful She was called copresident by some. It was probably an exaggeration but it wasnt way off base either.You skipped over the part in which she became part of another successful administration as a powerful member of Obamas cabinet. And I skipped over her being a successful senator in a large powerful state and being wellliked to this day there.You try to make it sound like she did something  years ago and stopped which is just    i find it hard to believe you say that in good faith. Its clearly just not the case or what I was saying. How about she has been a core part of the last  administrations that were successful? I think that sums it up well.Going by the issues too she is continuing from Obamas successes and pledging to correct any mistakes. Trump wants to U turn and went on an insane campaign to argue Obama was an illegitimate president.Would I have voted Democrat no matter what? No though I wouldve voted for any of the top  Democrats over any of the top two Republicans. However among all the candidates Hillary in my own opinion is the best poised to continue the winning streak because of her record.

Hell give enough praise and face saving moves to let Trump keep the delusion that hes in control while getting every last thing that he wants from Trump.  Putin knows that Hillary and for that matter Obama dont play that way.  They have no illusions about Putin except that Putin is an evil authoritarian dictator.  ,HillaryForAmerica,d5tdcmq,4,t5_37t9f
8415339,0,t1_d5tfqwx,Gun control versus gun rights has always been a very complex problem but there are a few simple steps which need to be taken to lower gun violence. First off we need to make sure that people on the nofly list and terrorist watch list cant buy guns. Ive heard from a few people that the nofly list is too spotty to use as a guideline but I also advocate reforming the nofly list and applying constant scrutiny to new names being placed on that list. When we have a tool we can trust in the nofly list we can make sure that dangerous people are neither on our planes or buying guns. A second issue would be applying simple background checks on those buying assault rifles. Though this seems commonsense the fact is that the NRA has been against it for a long time. Just this tiny bit of reform could have stopped several mass shootings in the last year alone from occurring.Similarly many concerned about gun violence focus on highprofile attacks but we need to concentrate also on suicide. Suicides consist of two thirds of gun deaths in America so we need to make sure that mental health projects are getting the funding they need to reduce those numbers.,HillaryForAmerica,d5tglle,6,t5_37t9f

8637818,0,t3_4y5bgv,Rant Im getting really tired of having my over a decade of dedicated volunteering organizing and protesting in favor of leftist causes be dismissed just because Im voting for Hillary Clinton. Jagoffs that have paid attention for all of two minutes and who have never organized actually organized volunteers or done any actual volunteering are still calling me a neoliberal shill. Jesus fuck its frustrating. Ive spent most of my Saturday mornings for  years doing patient escorting at Planned Parenthood and have been harassed and stalked because of it .  Ive spent countless hours since I was  coordinating volunteers for voter registration candidate canvassing  data entry and phone banking. Ive organized sexual assault awareness and prevention campaigns written grant proposals prepared educational literature spoken to groups and participated in protests.  Ive supported unions environmental causes feminist causes socialist causes. I have made posters and made copies and brought snacks and have been to a million meetings when Id rather have been relaxing in a hammock or playing video games. And an asshole who made calls for  hours for Bernie Sanders thinks Im insufficiently progressive because Im supporting a brilliant policyfocused candidate for president over Jill Stein an arrogant crackpot with all the policy sense god gave a rock with none of the usefulness.,HillaryForAmerica,d6lc34v,17,t5_37t9f
