7287193,0,t3_4f5u8p,Did a bit of research and I came up with these. Funnily enough quite a lot of shows that have crossovers with  or more KOn! voice actors are quite lewd. I wonder if thats just a sign of anime in general or if that tells us something.  Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai  The main character Kirino is voiced by Azusas VA and Ritsus VA voices Manami. They have some very hostile interactions to say the least. Manamis voice is very different from Ritsus so thats interesting. Heads up As the title alludes to the show features incest Kirino is the titular imouto. Relatively SFW although there are some fanservice scenes but the topic might make it unsuitable anyways. Seitokai YakuindomoAs previously mentioned in this thread both Ritsus and Mios VA are in SYD playing Aria and Shino respectively. This show is  terrible sex puns and its seriously hilarious but make sure you get good subs as its very easy for the puns to get lost in translation. It is so difficult to translate that from what I know no group is even trying anymore with the latest OVAs so were stuck with shitsubs from a. Heads up Obviously this is NSFW but its worth noting that they have relatively little fanservice its mostly just the topics that they joke about that are NSFW. Yuru YuriJust a small overlap here. Azusas VA does the voice for Mirakurun a character from a fictional anime in the show. Yuis VA does the voice of Chitose but they never interact. Ritsus VA does a guest voice at some point too but I think she only interacts with Chitoses sister.Heads up While the show is light on actual romantic yuri theres a bunch of jokes about young lesbians and it features a modicum amount of kissing so its NSFW. High School DxDThis show is a harem ecchi. Mios VA plays Rias Gremory the main love interest. Azusas VA plays Koneko the cute loli catgirl. Not much to say about this its gonna be pretty obvious whether youll like this show or not right from the start. Heads up NSFW very ecchi. Lots of topless boobs would be an understatement. Kiss x SisThis show is exactly what it sounds like. If you thought we were done with either the lewd or the incest then you were terribly terribly wrong. The ecchilevels continue to rise as Azusas VA does the voice for the older sister in this borderlinehentai harem ecchi show. Juns VA plays the role of Mikuni Miharu whom a has lovably nicknamed pisschan. Yeah the less said about that the better...Heads up I mean come on... You know. This is pretty much porn.  RoKyuBu!Yeah not entirely sure how Im gonna present this one. Naively this show is about a school basketball team featuring a bunch of year old girls and their new team captain Eren Yeager. Their last team captain got arrested for sexually abusing a child. Oh did I mention this is an ecchi psuedoharem show involving  year olds? Anyways Ritsus VA voices the supporting character Nobidome Manaka. Mugis VA plays the captain of the boys basketball team funnily enough. Mios VA plays one of the main characters however Nagatsuka Ice Age Saki. Heads up ... Its loliball...Heres a couple more shows which I am not as familiar with Toaru Majutsu no IndexRailgunYuis VA seems to be a main character in Railgun and has a supporting role in Index. Mugis VA seems to be a support character in both and Mios VA was a main character for the Index movie but has not appeared in the franchise otherwise.  Dog DaysDont know anything about this show whatsoever but it looks like Azusas VA voices a main character in the first two seasons and becomes a supporting character in the third. Jun Mugi and Mios voice actors voice other supporting characters throughout the third seasons except for Jun whos gone for the third one apparently. Another interesting bit of trivia I discovered Fujitou Chika Nodokas VA has only ever voiced Nodoka and one character in Guilty Crown. Ive never seen a VA have only two roles before so I assume its not her normal career. Its pretty interesting though out of all the KOn voices Nodoka seems to have the most normal voice i.e. the least anime voice. I think it works great for her character as shes the more down to earth one. ,k_on,d26i6s3,6,t5_2tpfm

7385710,0,t1_d2hhfn9,I call them big plans because I am excited about them. So in that respect they are big to me. Anyways I landed an internship position that I was very nervous about not getting a spot for and with that position it pays very well. With that funding there are a couple of short term investments I havent thought about before and I usually dont like to borrow from others. So on my free time in the future here I want to build an autonomous quadcopter. I have already started pulling apart a prebuilt quadcopter that uses remote controls and managed to operate the motors through an arduino but the keyword autonomous is a much more complicated process and will require application of control systems and sensors. I have spent a couple of years studying electrical engineering in college here and I am finally seeing some neat applications. Designing and building is a long and iterative process but it can be amazing to see the results. I hope with the shift away from studying for classes I can focus on more hobbylike uses of engineering I very much hope.So my other big plan which explains why I came to this subreddit in the first place and I would like some opinions to bounce off here I want to travel to Japan to see the physical manifestation of the KON! high school Toyosato Elementary School. I actually saw photos of this school about  years ago it just never occurred to me to actually physically go there until a couple months ago. I began writing notes on what I will need to do to make this trip realizable but school has held me back lately and I hope to hop back on this soon. Visiting another country outside of the United States terrifies me but that fear should not hold me back here. I kept thinking about this idea of traveling over there kept thinking how absurd it is just to go there to simply be in a building. I could travel to many other places in this world. I feel this is more special more meaningful to me. I loved this show it brought out this great realization in me of a simplistic passionate loving and carefree utopian reality a reality I think everybody should have feelings of but not necessarily the same experience. For just a little bit I want to live in my fantasy truely have that warmth of an endearing and joyful atmosphere. I spend a lot of time doing my best to work with others and to be productive. It saddens me to see many people suffering in this unfair indifferent and relentlessly painful world most of the time underservingly. Besides having a persistent work ethic traveling to this school in Japan has come to be my only resolution to handle my current state of mind in this world my realization of a dark world. Apologies into getting philosophical and a little sappy about my feelings here I feel the subject matter important and I hope others consider this as well. Anyways I welcome any tips to get me over there! I have set my mind I really want to do this. It will really pull me out of my confort zone and maybe I might enjoy the other aspects of Japan if the destination doesnt do its justice. If anybody here is seriously committed as I am I welcome the company of others to come along.,k_on,d2hpdra,2,t5_2tpfm
