5563038,0,t1_cwmmg59,I am getting some answers fortunately enough!I upgraded to Windows . previously using  and I was still having the issue even after a clean reinstall so it isnt to do with game files my install of Windows or any installed programs.What I noticed in the Windows  task manager is that whenever my disk usage reaches  which it spikes to sometimes my game stutters and crashes and my CPU usage consequently goes down to a very low  since the game technically isnt running it isnt doing anything when it has crashed. I dont think disk usage is visible on Windows  but I did a bit of digging about how to fix the disk usage problems and tried a few of them and it seemed to fix it or at least stop it for the time being.If you are on Windows  I would recommend looking at disk usage graph in task manager to see if that coincides with our stutters. I dont know what to do in Windows  to see disk usage on a graph but there is probably a program out there. ,tf2techsupport,cwmn8o8,1,t5_2y15i

Ticking applying and unticking things is a bit of a blind attempt too but it might help so its worth a shot.,tf2techsupport,d1n5h71,2,t5_2y15i
