657031,0,t1_cgew7zf,Awesome thanks! I appreciate it! Its working like a dream now! Can I use an external hard drive such as passport as a main storage system?,bootcamp,cgeycy9,1,t5_2t55n
902223,0,t3_24fwc4,It would be best to put the SSD in the hard drive spot format it set it up with OS X and then proceed to make a BootCamp partition for Windows and install.This is all very complicated and involves a lot not only do you have to reinstall OS X on the SSD but also enable TRIM support with TRIM enabler from MacUpdate.com as Apple will only do so for their SSDs not a third party.Also you need to clean the cooling fins of dust behind the fans.If you have little or no experience with reinstall operating systems or internal hardware stuffs I really highly suggest you seek the services of the local PCMac geek they have the tools the software and the experience.Another thing if you have been wearing out your keyboard superdrive USB ports video card playing intense D games overheating it wearing out the trackpad or case its likely on its last legs already and may not be worth upgrading. However if you havent been using it much andor do like I do and baby the heck out of it all stress possible is on external devices then it might be worth upgrading to a SSD and maxing out the RAM GB for your model.,bootcamp,ch6u61v,1,t5_2t55n

2663993,0,t3_2qhys8,Apple Support Bootcamp states only Windows   is supported. Windows . isnt as yet it may never come.Apple has been kludging things for years to allow certain versions of Windows to run on a Mac its been like this since Windows XP.Now that Windows uses UEFI like Macs uses EFI that has given Microsoft control over what hardware Windows gets installed on like Apple has with OS X on Apple hardware.There is a new team in charge of Windows versions now . is a kludge to get people to buy PC hardware again as Win  was so radical it just turned people off.Windows  is going to be awesome but its not ready for release yet and even then its going to take Apple a year after that to get it seamlessly working on a Mac.gtI need windows for VR Dev work.This is what you need the MacPro and Final Cut Pro X? are on their way out Its because Apple has been gradually leaving the Pro market due to OS Xs shrinking market share. currently about . now down from  before the iPhone arrived according to NetApplicationsIts because Apple is primarily a consumer products tech company and not a professional platform anymore the XServer XRAID and  MacBook Pro are gone. I had to switch to a  Windows PC as I need the larger portable screen.Aperture has been discontinued in favor of something integrated with iPhoto or Photos for iOS or somethingOne of the important things in professional work is to ensure a stable supply of hardware and software a platform you can rely upon so your files can be edited upon in future versions.Apple wants to move out of the professional space and concentrate on only selling limited hardware to their consumer base.Sell the iMac and buy what you need for a future in hardwaresoftware you can buy a MacAir for portable needs.All in ones are terrible for reliability anyway they clog with dust you cant clean out and the entire machine has to go in for repair if any part fails. A tower with independent and replaceable parts offers more reliability in professional environments.Unlike with Apple there is plenty of local hardware and software support from trained professionals for Windows as they are used  in businesses so REAL help is only a phone call away. Not dragging a huge iMac into a crowded Apple Store only to be told you dont have a appointment.Windows versions get up to  years of support depending when implemented. OS X versions come out annually and only get up to  years of support. More OS upgrades means more third party software upgrades and problems performance degradation.,bootcamp,cn6b6l4,0,t5_2t55n
2922046,0,t1_co07hta,gtcode object is not signed at allIs Gatekeeper turned off? Apple isnt going to allow unsigned code to run.gtThere is nothing wrong with burning an ISO although I need Windows for school and currently dont have access to it or the ability to burn a disc.Im not as familiar with how BootCamp handles Windows . installs via USB however I do know the retail diskburned ISO copy works and you have a Superdrive.If the  MBP is a  then it can only install Windows  not  Apple doesnt supply the drivers for  so even if you hack it on its not going to work .There shouldnt be any problem installing Windows on a Mac BootCamp handles it for the most part unless it specifically spews a error and that usually has to do with a full or no space for BootCamp partition on boot hard drives due to OS X data being in the way.Since its a older machine its likely best you use Win  and thats good until . Windows  is a mess and Win . still a abortion. By the time Windows  comes out you should be looking at a new piece of hardware  I suggest just buying a PC instead.I got a  HD laptop for a mere  about the same sort of money one has to spend to buy Windows retail copy.  Sure its no powerhouse but if you know how to manage and tweak Windows it can be fast enough for  years just the same as most Mac laptops.Windows  is going to be a free upgrade for Win  and up.,bootcamp,co08um1,1,t5_2t55n
3950782,0,t1_cr6lyyb,gt The user does NOT have access to the EFI partition its a locked and hidden partition.gt Youre wrong.You know what I mean.gtIt requires a reboot to get to a mode where it can be installed where the thick progress bar is displayed then a reboot to bring the box back into normal mode.Uh yea two reboots.gtYou cant delete the firmware from flash without connecting a harness to the flash part and doing so by hand with a flash programmer.Sure just let the battery go dead long enough and see what happens.gtYou continue to act as though you know everything and you continue to give bad advice. This has been a longstanding issue with you unfortunately.I dont know everything nobody does but I have installed and used third party bootloaders on Macs and understand whats going on from experience.You cant even count reboots.Goodby asshole.,bootcamp,cr6mftw,1,t5_2t55n
4422953,0,t1_cso3s1m,Itll show EFI if you still have a bootable external drive connected or if the partition running windows is not called bootcamp anymore because of a format given through the windows setup. Ofcourse this behavior I observed during my own struggles with Bootcamp so mileage may vary on that one. Good to know you got it working though. From personal experience I can now say this this whole mess definitely does not Just work and its not as easy as it should be to figure out why not. Couple of specific error messages would not go amiss in this whole circus.,bootcamp,cso7grv,1,t5_2t55n

11048819,0,t3_5xn6rk,easiest way to share data between macOS and Win is to create FAT partition and use it as storage for all the files you want to share.
