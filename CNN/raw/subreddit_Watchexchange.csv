2479186,0,t3_2nyzjl,This is a repost of a WTS post I created  days prior.Hello!I have for sale a LNIB Orient Ray Black dial with the metal bracelet. Long story short I saw the Orient Ray I decided that I needed to have it in my collection bought it on Amazon steel bracelet version paid . USD about  weeks ago and after wearing it once realized that I have similar watches already. Instabuyers remorse. Since I bought it tried it on and resized it I didnt want to refund the watch back to Amazon. Now that I am clearing out my watch box yet again I have it up for sale.Its a really nice piece with great fitfinishheft and it really does wear nicely. I am willing to do   paypal fees and shipping assuming that you are CONUS Im in Chicagoland totaling to  send to my paypal. That equates to a  discount for a watch that was resized and then worn for all of a few hours. It has no visible scratches dents or marks and it is the definition of like new in box. Comes with full box and papers.Please know I am a private seller so no returns issued after sale. However seeing as we are all adults here if there is a problem please contact me and I will try my best to work out any issues that may arise. Also note that I have sold many watches here and on other forums and I have yet to have a problem with any transaction buy or sell. Picture album here  I also have a Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical for sale here FS Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical   USDThanks!Brian,Watchexchange,cmi61c0,0,t5_2sqne

7892378,0,t3_4nec13,Hey againI would like to sell my Marvin M watch. I purchased this watch about a year ago from the original owner here and wore it a good amount when I first got it but havent in a few months. Marvin isnt a well known brand and there website isnt the greatest but here  is a review of the white faced version that I found very informative when originally purchasing the watch. The watch is mm wide about mm thick and mm lug to lug. It is a Swiss quartz movement and the battery was changed a few months ago. Everything works just as it should. There a basic signs of wear throughout the watch but none that stick out. Mostly concentrated on the lugs the scratches are pretty miniscule. The sapphire crystal is spotless and has a cool blueish tint when in the right light as some sapphire crystals tend to. The rubber strap is still in great shape and super comfortable if it fits. That being said this is a bigger watch and if your wrist is under  you will need to get another strap. The strap is weird on this watch as the width is actually mm but mm is covered so you can get by with a mm strap. This is kind of an odd piece so let me know if you have any questions!Currently asking . Paypald and shipped.Thanks for looking!,Watchexchange,d436djc,1,t5_2sqne
7951725,0,t3_4o5utr,Up for sale is my Muhle Glashutte Seabattalion. Its a titanium cased diver with GMT which is fantastic for travel and everyday use. Waterproof to m which is more than anything most people will throw at it. German made and is built like a tank similar to Sinn watches and etc. really comfortable on the wrist and fantastic for everywear due to its subtlety. However its still a diver so it has significant wrist presence especially with the yellow on blue color scheme. Features a display back as well which is a nice touch on divers especially on that is rated to m. the movement is surprisingly well finished for such a great utilitarian tool watch. I have another titanium diver the tudor pelagos and I must say this wears much nicer. The corners are more forgiving and despite having a GMT complication its much thinner than the pelagos. the only reason im moving this one over the pelagos is that the pelagos was a gift so it was sentimental. Other than that its hard to justify when this one is so much more watch and a way better bang for your buck. Condition is excellent as you can see from the pictures. Barely any wear marks and only from the occasional strap change. Crystal bezel and case is in excellent condition. Time keeping is great and consistant as well so you wont have to worry about servicing it. However just out of curiosity muhle has a service centre in Canada and they quoted about  CAD for a service. Which translates to about less than  bucks USD with the weak exchange. Thats OEM service which is a bit of a shame to say cheaper than my goto watchmaker. As you can see in my pic that its on a bracelet. This is the ONLY seabattalion ever sold with a bracelet. I emphasize that because that was always the detracting factor for those who like this watch but want the bracelet for the versatility factor. The bracelet is from the Rasmus another muhle watch and since the case is the same it fits like a glove. It also has a sweet diver extension clasp. The watch also comes with a OEM rubber strap cut to a  inch wrist. It also comes with another OEM rubber strap that is new. Im looking for  USD. The last one that was sold was at  USD on a rubber strap. Mine comes with the oem bracelet oem rubber strap cut to  inch wrists brand new oem rubber strap and oem deployant. comes with muhle box warranty infoinstructions. Its price so aggressively because im looking to consolidate and chasing after a new watch. To reiterate this the ONLY seabattalion which has a bracelet. Payment by paypal wire EMT or etc and if there are associated fees they are negotiable. Fully insured and express shipping is included. Ive done a few deals here on Watchexchange and can have some long standing members vouch for me but my real feedback is on WUS.

11073855,0,t3_5y4yzq,Proof of ownership hereHey everyone!Today I am selling an excellentcondition Seagull  Panda Chronograph. This is one I really wish I bonded more with and is a beautiful chronograph for the money. I picked this up preowned a few months ago in great shape and have only worn it a dozen or so times since. Everything has been running fine unfortunately I just have not worn it enough and will be putting the funds towards some other projects.  Overall this is a great way to pick up a reliable mechanical chronograph without putting a hole in your wallet. The panda version of the  is slightly larger than the original with a mm x mm case and mm lugs. The mineral crystal and exhibition case back have no damage to report and the case has some light scuffs along the lugs. The second hand will occasionally reset  a few seconds off center. Otherwise the watch and the chronograph complication function exactly as they should. The watch runs off of Seagulls mechanical jewel ST movement which is absolutely beautiful through the exhibition case back. The movement runs at  BPH.The watch will ship on the Seagull red amp black NATO and I will also be throwing in a mm genuine leather Hadley Roma band that is black with red stitching. Asking SOLD CONUS with shipping and PayPal fees covered. Shipping will be in a USPS small day flat rate box. I am not really looking for trades at the moment and local deals in the Chicago area are welcome. Please feel free to comment or message with any questions or offers. I have plenty of feedback on Reddit and other platforms and references are available if needed.Thanks for looking! ,Watchexchange,den7md9,1,t5_2sqne

11144187,0,t1_dev693b,Ive honestly not owned it long enough to have to change the battery out personally however the previous owner indicated that it was always done regularly and pressure tested afterwards ie.  year intervals generally and never left unuseddead battery hence why it hasnt suffered any acid damage like a lot of these usually do. And yes everything works perfectly the bezel is surprisingly tight for its age but not too stiff. Just a pleasant amount of resistance and no sloppiness or play in it unlike some watches Ive owned. The daydate wheels are perfect as is the screw down crown and the lume makers on the dial are JUST starting to develop some lovely patina  hope this helps! ,Watchexchange,dev6k26,1,t5_2sqne

11279642,0,t3_60ze3t,UPDATE After quite a few tirekickers and offers that didnt come through Im ready to move on. Ive priced this one very competitively. If youre on the fence now is your chance to jump over. After making some moves independently Id prefer to sell this outright rather than trade unless you have a Smiths PRSA. Here is a gorgeous and rare Omega Seamaster Geneve from . Its in wonderful condition complete with Seamaster hippocamp detail on the back of the case and a nearly pristine dial. In addition this watch comes complete with an original Omega bracelet although its hard to photograph it looks amazing in person. Included also is a black alligatorembossed leather band Hadley Roma along with a spare set of pins in the event you want to change the look of the watch. The watch is in perfect working order having been purchased from another redditor here on watchexchange a few months ago. I find myself not wearing the vintage watch very much mainly out of fear of damaging such an wonderful piece running around after two young kids. So Im looking to get back what I paid for the watch and band  USD in order to fund another purchase. Reducing further Im willing to take a loss on my investment in order to facilitate a sale or trade. Im pricing at  for the watch bracelet and additional band... including basic international shipping other shipping options available at cost. Thats about as fair a deal as youre likely to find. Im open to trades but not for anything vintage. Watch ships from Canada.Album Proof  from the Mar original postAny questions please ask. EDIT Further price reduction.,Watchexchange,dfaj4i7,1,t5_2sqne

11627543,0,t3_65xle4,Hey folks I am thinning out my collection and these are some of the watches I could bare to part with. Ive done my best to look at current prices for these or similar watches and I feel I have priced fairly based on that. a. This watch has a gorgeous silver face and gold accents. Some of the gold has started to rub off which isnt surprising after  or so years. The crystal has a fair amount of small scratches on it but they kinda add to the character of the watch. Strap is nothing special generic leather strap that I hole punched to try and give it a rally look the bottom hole on the non buckle side isnt great though. I love the watch as it reminds me of an Heuer Carrera but I dont need two as. These watches have a great history and here is an article about them the a was the same as the a but with a day date complication!. Asking . shipped.m. This watch is in great shape with minimal scratches on the crystal and case. Its on a cheaper fossil leather band at the moment. The battery recently died but the watch was running perfect  right before that. instruction booklet for the watch will be included. As far as my research took me the m was almost identical to the m. Both have awesome alarm chronograph and timing functions as well as the famous seiko dancing hands function. A smart and slim looking dress watch as well as a fun piece of seiko history. Asking . shippedSeiko This watch was never worn! Still has the original blue plastic on the back of the case. Battery is dead however. Its nothing to crazy but it is a very nice example of this series of watches. Asking . shipped.I am negotiable on all prices so feel free to make an offer worst I can say is no. Furthermore I am always open to trades I love divers and chronographs so feel free to try me on whatever you have too like I said earlier worst I can say is no!
