6614009,0,t1_d03fkku,Why not just promote equal access? I know inside Im broken in so many little ways that people would find repulsive if they knew and furthermore I suspect everybody else is too. So instead of loathing myself I try to live and let live. I dont support any legislation that is exclusionary based on protected classes and I think sexual orientation should be a protected class in Virginia it seems to me it is but Im sick with a cold so I could be wrong.Does this make sense? I get what youre saying in that we should let the idiots selfidentify their bigoted business and then let them wither on the vine but Im more for live and let live.The book Aint Nobodys Business If You Do is a great place to start when thinking about open and equal access in a free society.,Virginia,d03g0qa,8,t5_2qj17

Youngerolderall kinds of people are just making smarter financial decisions and understand that if a car isnt necessary a car isnt necessary.People like Mr. Atkinson fail to understand that this cult of car ownership is almost exclusively confined to the US and somehow its really bad in Virginia.

First Landing State Park is on the Bay and has lots of very well kept trails. None of them are very difficult to navigate so it is more of a nature walk than hike. Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge is in the southern portion of Virginia Beach and borders the ocean and inland waters. It is larger and also well maintained. Lots of great spots in both for nature watching and photography.,Virginia,dcbzbet,3,t5_2qj17
