39011,0,t1_ceiv23k,He means get a battery charger something like this and plug it in.What I like to do this time of year is plug it in overnight before work or school. That way I dont have to worry about it not starting. The charge will usually last a full day and sometimes I dont have to plug it in for a few days after a good full initial charge.I own both this one for if the battery is pretty close to or completely dead the A start feature is nice and this one which I use for overnight charging and maintaining my motorcycles battery over the winter. Not sure where you live but Canadian Tire has a good selection of chargers,jetta,ceiveth,2,t5_2wa8m

1604555,0,t3_2cnu6g,it is very common for service garages to check tires pressures but mechanics are lazy instead of filling the tires to the proper or recommended psi they will just take air out of all of them to make sure they are level.  That being said low tire pressures will cause your fuel consumption to suffer.  An oil change should not affect your fuel consumption if they use a different weight than what is recommended that could change your fuel consumption as the timing chain adjuster is hydraulically driven. this one while factual is less likely to cause an issue. ,jetta,cjhf7sf,1,t5_2wa8m

2148847,0,t3_2jkfeu,With that car check the PCV system hoses. The OEM lines wears out and cracks due to the heat. Just Google it up. People replace the lines with home Depot hoses. I just sent mine to a mechanic and had him install the PCV kit that I bought online. Its a bit of a bitch to install. Thats probably what usultryhues was talking about his car dying randomly due to some hose. Another one is the damn coolant sensor. Thats a  mins amp  sec fix with chatting and joking around. you can get the  sensor at your local pepboys. Repair shops will charge you around  to  to fix that fucker. I replaced mine and my brothers. Invest in a good engine code reader so you can diy amp save money. If the job is too much I just chuck if off to the repair shop and I tell them exactly what is wrong with my car. That way they cant bullshit you and drain your wallet. Oh my Transmission Control Module blew its brains out on mine couple months ago and its been a breeze at my LOCAL VW repair shop knowing what exactly your car is in for with the code P.

2219438,0,t1_cllxx8c,Theres a breather hose thats part of the intake system and links to the oil system. Theres a black plastic valve that connects a hose from the bottom of the engine one from the intake and the valve cover. It looks like a black disc. This gets full of a nasty mix of oil water and any other junk that the car inhaled that missed the filter. It looks like seedy peanut butter and is honestly pretty gross. Cleaning this the intake hose be careful not to hit the mass air sensor and the lower hose with choke cleaner thoroughly should solve this problem. But be careful with the hose that goes down it can be brittle and is actually pretty expensive to replace. ,jetta,cllxzj0,1,t5_2wa8m

Thank god Im an apple user. If its designed for that then awesome!The center console is very adjustable i noticed that immediately and really liked it.The Backseat hatch is cool to have for sure especially if I ever end up roadtripping to a ski resort which I hope I do.Im into Audio but no Audiophile I cranked up the volume on the one I test drove and really enjoyed it as a whole but didnt really get a chance to put it through its paces speakers nowadays are pretty solid anyways so they cant be too terrible.The Wipers dont bother me Floridian after all and my current car is the same way to clean the windshield under them you need to turn on the car start the wipers cut the engine off mid cycle of the wipers and lift both really dumb imho but nothing Im not used to so this car is basically as good in some aspects and much better in many others.

5264605,0,t3_3n2g9v,In addition to the fuse under the dash there is a fuse on the back of the radio. You may have to pull the radio out to check it. There are good video instructions based on the model but you will need special tools. When you get back there check and see if the radio is getting power. If the car is getting power to the radio your radio might be done. If there is no power to the radio then it should just be a fuse.As for the code this is not your problem. For clarity when you see the  pressing the  through  keys increments the corresponding number. If you press the  key  times you would get . The  key should be the enter key.,jetta,cvkm1ad,3,t5_2wa8m
