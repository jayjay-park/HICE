43273,0,t1_ceix4j5,People here like to give really specific advice on what you need and what you dont in a way that suggest that their way is the only right way but I think people know best for their selves provided the person doing the packing isnt a complete tool. Ive done sufficient amount of backpacking to know exactly what I need when I do a trip but Im sure if I posted the contents of my backpack here it would still be torn apart. People travel differently and for different purposes which always means they will be needing different things.And if it turns out you end up desperately needing something those are the kind of things you can buy anywhere and clothes you end up not needing are easily donated.,backpacking,cejcw8q,4,t5_2qpcz

194704,0,t3_1wc550,Find a local outdoor store. I know nothing about Ontario CA or the region but they will. They will probably have various regional guidebooks for sale as well as topo maps. Also buy your pack from them rather than ordering online. You want to be able to try on different packs to see which one fits you best. There are many different brands shapes and sizes. The employees should help by showing the proper way to load a weighted pack helping you find the right size etc. Same goes for boots. The tent hammock sleeping bag or whatever are dependent on weather.  Im sure there is a local hiking club based out Ontario. Theyre everywhere I have lived and typically will go once every month or two. A lot of these groups do volunteer trail repair and maintenance too and  theyre usually a pretty dedicated and knowledgeable bunch of folks that could lead you to some nice trails.,backpacking,cf0m93a,1,t5_2qpcz

465850,0,t1_cft6hq2, All the visas and fees I needed I handled at the borders but I definitely made sure I had the following with me at all times  extra passport photos  in US bills crisp and new a printout of my bank account statement at its richest moment updated shot records you can usually get required shots at small clinics at border towns if you dont take care of it before leaving the states a printout of a hostel reservation within the country I was travelling to and proof of onward travel even if I was just going to change the flight bus ticket whatever later. I didnt always need all of it and sometimes I didnt need any of it but it was good to have. Countries definitely want you to have an exit plan and you want to make sure you know how long you can stay in a given country usually  days in a one year period. Its pretty easy to just meander on over to the next country once your visa is about to expire it wasnt ever really a worry for me. I have heard mostly from gringos I met lving in Bolivia that its pretty easy to get your visa extended if you land a bartending job at a hostel or something but that you definitely want to make sure you have your paperwork in order. If you have questions call the local consulate. You DO NOT want to be at the mercy of a border guard. Bribery can work but its a sketchy sketchy situation that can go in a few different ways from tolerable to downright scary. Just make sure you keep up on what paperwork is required of you and have it on hand. Info on specific countries is available on the internet and is usually up to date. If the hotel reservations and onward travel papers arent exactly what youre intending thats YOUR business keep it simple for the border guards. ,backpacking,cft7vty,2,t5_2qpcz

Pick it up look at it look at other things..   Be indifferent like someone who has money to spend but isnt planning on if he doesnt have to.  Look at things let them catch your attention but not too much walk away browse come back etc. Let the seller name a price make that the price is too damn high face and completely lowball your first offer less than  of what you were quoted.  You are likely to get a the price is too damn low bro my kids are going to die type response and another offer.  The lower you start the lower youll end up for the final price.  Just dont go too low you dont want to be too insulting. After theyve told you how much something costs and youve done your this costs too damn much routine wait for them to say What would do you think a fair price would be?..  From my experience thats one of their last cards and an indicator that they really want to make the sale  giving you some wiggle room in the negotiations. Always assume that you are getting quoted a significant enough increase in price over what the item actually costs unless youre in a restaurant.  It will take time and energy to bring that price down so its up to you whether your time is worth the money.  I sometimes haggled but oftentimes just didnt care to spend the time haggling too much.

Dont forget humidity toohiking in humid conditions is a lot more stressful than you can imagine since sweating simply doesnt cool you off much if at all.  Constant stops because of overheatingwater breaks can really eat up the time.

1824528,0,t3_2fe49t,Not sure of when you posted this so my answer may be irrelevant by now. I have been using the talon  for years as my go to pack. For anything between a night and a week out on the trail. I love it. It fits my back well. However Im  lbs  so that might not help you much.  The pack depending on how you pack it does a great job at distributing the weight.  I usually carry a total trail weight of around  lbs. thats with food and water. anything up to  if great.  But anything more might start to ride a little heavy for this pack. Also a great part of the pack is it only weight a couple pounds and with the removal of the top pouch you can bring it down even further. The only problem I have experienced so far is when you need to hike with one of the large bear canisters it doesnt quite fit laying flat in the back. Therefor you need to keep it up right. Which isnt a deal breaker for me. But maybe to someone else.   Hope this help. ,backpacking,ck91nkx,1,t5_2qpcz

Also if someone mugs you just get out the faux wallet throw it on the floor and run. By the time they find out its a decoy youll be long gone.Women travelling alone in SA and CA have to be careful. I dont mean to scare you but definitely keep your guard up. I walked in on three dudes passing an unconscious girl around in Guatemala. Called the cops and they really didnt give a shit. They didnt even ask where I was or what the guys looked like. Also someone slipped a Rufelin to my girlfriend in Belize she didnt get raped thank God because I found her and got her out of there. This was in a hostel and probably by a white guy so dont think youre safe from that in the hostels.Also whenever you cross borders research them find out how much they are supposed to charge and have a screenshot handy. Border cops tend to try and squeeze extra money out of you dont think theyre above it just because theyre wearing a uniform. I didnt take any malaria meds when I was there Ive taken them before and they really suck. Take precautions against mosquitoes and you should be fine. Long sleeves and deet in dawn and dusk the middle of the day you should be fine. Also vitamin B makes your blood repulsive to mosquitoes and is actually good for you. The diving in Belize is mediocre. The Blue Hole is overrated. Belize city is shit. Youre not gonna want to spend more time there than strictly necessary though Caye Caulker is pretty cool. I would cut the Belize time down and spend more time in Guatemala and Yucatan. If scuba diving is your thing the best I saw around there by far was in and around Tulum. Utila is pretty cool too but a bit more of a spring break vibe idk if youre into that. As for your Honduras trip Im pretty sure you can get a direct bus from La Ceiba where the boats to Utila go to Copan which is right at the Guatemalan border and has some ruins. From there you can go straight to Guate City or even Antigua. Id stick to the tourist shuttles. Theyre more expensive than the chicken busses but not by much and they are much more comfortable and go directly to and from all the tourist hot spots so itll be faster.I would rethink skipping Nicaragua. Its basically the same as Costa Rica except a million times cheaper. Its relatively safe by Latin American standards and incredibly beautiful. Theres a lot of little surfer towns along the coast that are really fun. Costa Rica rivals most of Europe as far as costs. Sorry if this spooks you you do need to be careful though getting robbed is pretty damn common around there. That being said Latin America is my favorite part of the world and Ive been everywhere. Its beautiful the locals are great besides the sketch balls the food is amazing the music kicks ass. Youre gonna have a great time.

I wear them until they start to smell.I wash them when I get a chance and when I know they will be dry by the time Ill leave that place Is there a drier? Is there a radiator?  Can I hang them outside? Hows the weather? etc.. I usually wear the same tshirt when sleeping and dont mind it getting slightly more smelly and dirtier. I have showers in the morning.If Im staying with someone they usually let me use their washing machine.

That may seem stupid to say considering animals poop in the woods as well but human fecal matter is responsible for significantly more water pollution and illnesses than animals. I understand you and the majority of the people on this post disagree with me and I know Im not going to change your minds.

2732736,0,t3_2rceh5,Heres a copypaste from some advice I gave hereHi!I have been to Brazil Bolivia Peru Chile and Argentine. Currently I have been living in Bogot for  months. I am originally from the Netherlands. The first time I visited the continent was back when I was .BoliviaBolivia might just be my favourite country on the continent. I spend a month and a half here but I still dont feel like Ive seen everything. The country is about  indigenous so the culture is quite unique. It is also very cheap.Sucre or the White City is an UNESCO heritage site. The city itself is beautiful. As the nickname might give away most of the buildings are bright white. There are some nice museums to visit in the city. I would recommend doing a hike in the surrounding mountains. I did a four day hike which took us past waterfalls valleys prehistoric rock paintings and a huuuuge crater. I went with the nonprofit organization Condor Trekkers who do a lot for the local communities.Samaipata is a small quaint city in the east of the country. It is located in a beautiful place but there isnt all that much to do there. I managed to stick around here for like a week because I met some great people and the place is great if you want some down time but other than that there isnt so much to do.Salar de Uyuni was a highlight. The biggest saltflat in the world that turns into the largest mirror on earth in the wet season. Make sure to take the tour from Tupiza rather than from Uyuni for three reasons.  Youll get an extra day to the trip for just a little bit more money.  Youll see the salt flats on your last day rather than the first thus saving the best for last.  Youll see the sunrise over the Salar which might just be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. The trip to the Salar is very stunning as well. Youll pass through deserts and past colourful lakes youll see flamingos and vicuas and youll bathe in volcanic hotsprings.La Paz is the highest capital in the world and quite cool for a visit. You can fill up maybe three or four days here. Nearby you can mountainbike down the most dangerous road in the world the Camino de la Muerte which is a lot of fun.Titicaca seems to be loved by many people. I didnt think it that special to be frank.PeruPeru is a great country with lots of things to do. Being the epicentre of the Inca empire there is a lot of history to be found here and the cuisine is second to none.Cuzco was the capital of the Inca empire and you can tell. Walking around the city there is both colonial and Inca history to be found at every corner. The city is crowded with backpackers who go to Machu Picchu from here. There are four ways to get to the famous Inca city. The first would be to take a bus which is lame. The other three are all multiday treks. The Salkantay trek is the one I would recommend.The Colca Canyon is twice as deep as the Grand Canyon and very impressive. You can visit it from Arequipa which in my experience was pretty boring. I did a four day hike through the Canyon without a guide and had a great time. At the Cruz del Condor you can see Andean Condors the largest flying bird on earth.ArgentinaIn Argentina I just spend a little time. I went to Buenos Aires and the Iguazu falls and would recommend both.Buenos Aires is a very European city. I felt more like I was walking around in Paris or Madrid than in South America when I was here. The Argentinian steak should be enough reason to visit. Mouthwatering!Iguazu falls are just absolutely breathtaking. Beautiful place.,backpacking,cnep89m,2,t5_2qpcz

I havent really spent a ton of time with the layout but instead Ive been more focusing on writing content research etc.  But again I really appreciate your encouragement and Ill definitely spend some time on the UI once I get some more quality content out.,backpacking,cno17ph,1,t5_2qpcz
2827753,0,t3_2sh8ne,I wouldnt worry about the deer at all. If you see javelina just stop and stay completely still. They cant see very good at all and Ive had them walk within ten feet of me. They really dont like dogs though and most people who have been hurt by them had a dog with them. Mountain lions rarely attack people and populations that are hunted are even less likely to be a problem. I have camped on the ground in the deserts of Az without a tent many times and have had tarantulas crawling across my chest that woke me up. They dont want to bother you. I have woken up and rolled my gear up and had bark scorpions staying warm under me. Make sure you shake out your boots in the AM. I even had a giant centipede which I hear can have a really painful bite crawl across my foot as I got up in the morning to go pee. Ok now the snakes. South Texas will have the western diamondback rattlesnake. This snake accounts for the majority of venomous snake bites in the US. Dont buy a snake bite kit they dont work. The best advice I can give you if some one is bit is to seek medical attention immediately. What I have been taught is that if there is absolutely no way you are going to get out and get help before the venom moves up and possibly causes respiratory problems the last possible thing and worst case scenario you need to tourniquet of the limb. Containing the venom will most likely cause the loss of that limb but you might have a better chance of getting out alive. Somebody else might offer better advice but this is what I learned many years ago. With all that said I have encountered probably forty rattlesnakes of seven different species and have literally stepped on one and stepped over and straddled two and pulled myself up on a ledge in a canyon and come face to face with one. I have never been bitten and they rarely rattle to worn you. Wear high boots and gaiters if you know the snakes are going to be out. There is a lot that you should be prepared for and if you are inexperienced you might want to hook up with some people who know what they are doing and use their experience to learn. If you have any other questions just ask. Im no expert but I know other people here are very knowledgable. PS most injuries on the trail are mechanical injuries like twisted ankles or knees or maybe cuts and scrapes. Bring a small first aid kit and know how to use it. ,backpacking,cnpie6i,1,t5_2qpcz

3736907,0,t3_32lpm5,Yeah theres totally enough to do in Sri Lanka for  weeks! Plus its not really worth paying the  fee for an Indian Visa only to be there for a week especially in Chennai! Highlights of Sri Lanka for me  Weligama Said to be the best shore for learning to surf. Although not a sunbathing type area. Unawatuna Relaxed beach town with a little bit of jungle to walk through. Goyambokka Just on the edge of Tangalle. This place has a pretty incredible beach called Amanwella Beach. You have to walk a little to find it but once you do its really stunning. Udawalawe This place is renowned for its National Park amp is certainly worth a visit. There is also an Elephant Orphanage here which is lovely too. Dalhousie If youre into fitness  love a challenge this is where you can climb the famous Adams Peak. Its a ft Mountain which thousands of people climb every day. Most start the climb at around am as we did to make it to the top for a truly amazing sunrise! At the top is said to be Buddhas footprint  The first place on earth he first set foot. In other religions it is said to be both Shivas amp Adams.  Nuwara Eliya Otherwise known as Little England. This is a nice hillside town with pubs parks amp beautiful views. You can also visit the Pedro tea plantations amp factory here. Ella Although very small this town has a really nice feel to it. Its home to Little Adams Peak  a smaller alternative to the one in Dalhousie. Theres also a Waterfall around km out of the main town which is pretty beautiful! If youre only away from home for  weeks this shouldnt be an issue but if you have western food cravings this is definitely a great place to cure them! Both Cafe Chill and Dream Cafe do excellent food. Kandy Kandy is a big busy city with a few nice things to see. The lake first of all is beautiful! We saw all sorts of wildlife just by walking around it one afternoon. Theres also the Giant Buddha up on the hillside this offers great views of the city. The Temple of the Tooth is also here although we didnt feel it was worth the rs each to get in! Dambulla The only real reason to go here is to see Lion Rock in Sigiriya. This costs around rs to enter. However there is a rock across from it which only costs rs to climb amp is MUCH more interesting. Its not just some boring steps to the top amp when you do get to the top you have a view of Lion Rock amp the entire landscape.  Negombo We stayed here as an alternative to Colombo. Its much much closer to the airport just km compared to the km to Colombo. Its also a lot more relaxed. It has a little stretch of beach where you can choose to sail out for the afternoon or just sit amp have a few drinks. It also has quite a few little bars amp restaurants along the main road. Sorry if that was a bit long to read but hopefully it will give you some ideas to really get the most out of your  weeks!! Have an amazing trip amp if you have any questions dont hesitate to ask ,backpacking,cqi8d0t,2,t5_2qpcz

You can camp around the country just beware sheep dogs and try to ask or gesture the property owner. You can usually camp on the beach though theres a small fee in some places. Id recommend couchsurfing. There are PC volunteers around the country on there and there are others who host through the site as well. As far as food things are pretty cheap outside Tirana. At regular old places you can get a good salad for  leke a plate of fries for  leke pilaf rice dish for  leke etc though meat costs more. Pizzas are generally around  leke. Transportation usually costs  leke per hour depending on where you go and whether you take a busminibus cheaper or a small minivan a furgon more expensive. ,backpacking,cqtsmb8,2,t5_2qpcz

The Steripen is neither better or worse than a Mini or Squeeze under most conditions but has the distinct advantage of being better in the cold.  If a Mini or Squeeze freezes up theyre ruined since that ruptures the micropores in the filter element.  In the winter I use a Steripen and keep the batteries in my pocket until I need to use it.  A Steripen is also better against viruses but for the most part that is of no effect in North America viruses arent a real issue.

4399571,0,t1_cskduv0,Stick to the hammock. Weight vs a good night sleep is not much of a conundrum. Ill take an extra pound to sleep well. You probably wont need the rainfly. Check the weather first by all means but really its been hot and dry. I just spent a week in Kings Canyon and while that was in the middle of the heat wave it never dropped below like  or so. My friend didnt even bother with a bivy and I basically slept in mosquito netting the entire time and was fine. Bear spray is straight up prohibited in Yosemite and in SEKI. Insane right? Anyway using it or being caught carrying it might net you a fine. You probably can ditch it and save a pound.Fire starting Id just go with a mini bic and a pack of waterproof matches as a backup. Id rely on tinder in the area. If Im really feeling Boy Scoutish Ill soak a cotton ball or three in vasoline and put that in a small zip lock baggie. But if you want to use your firestarter thats pretty minimal weight.Water filter consider a sawyer squeeze or sawyer mini. The mini is like...  ounces and  bucks. The squeeze is a couple oz heavier but you could set up a gravity filter station with it which I like a lot.Again your rainfly could almost certainly be ditched. If youre paranoid or crossing streams get a trash compacter bag to line your pack with.Thats an extra  pounds shaved off and I consider  pounds baseweight to be in UL territory. I dont see any clothes in there. Which is fine. I might throw in an extra pair of socks other than what Im wearing. Undies too.  days isnt long so Id list it more of a comfort item than anything else but yeah.Edit Youve got your platy and thats fine but I like to have an extra water bottle in case I want to dump some sports drink tabs into it or whatever. I have the Atmos AG as well and have found that the Smart Water bottles fit into those itty bitty pockets pretty well. Better than nagalenes at least and they only weigh an ounce or two.

Time of year you are going type of hostels you enjoy party laid back social ect what your travel experience is what type of travel experiences you have enjoyed in the past why you want to visit if you will be camping ect. Being into all sorts of different things is great but makes it really hard to make useful recommendations. Most mustsees can be found in guidebooks or on tripadvisor. What we can help with personal experiences and advice on plans you already have. But its hard to do that when you provide very little information. Belfast Dublin and Galway are all great stops. The Black Cab tours come highly recommended by everyone because they are amazing and eye opening so dont miss that. I loved the newer Titanic museum. In Dublin I loved the Book of Kells but many find it boring I had been wanting to see it since I was  and the Chester Beatty Library. I also recommend the night of Food Folk and Fairies as a different way to spend an evening. Newgrange is an easy day trip along with the Hill of Tara but again might not be interesting to everyone.

5666794,0,t3_3sk6o8,Thailand is one of this places everyone is going you dont have any locations EASY to reach that are not in some way a hidden gem with less tourists. I was backpacking for one month in thailand and you can choose  i would say paths the I want to party and met a lot of people from western countriespath or the i want to chill explore and live with the culturepath. Some people like me choose a mix of both. If you want to party go to Ko Phangan Ko Tao Phi Phi Islands Phuket Pattaya Beach. If you want to chillexploreculture more go to Chiang Mai Chiang Rai Pai Ao NangKrabi or the Party island but on locations where less party zones are in Ko Phangan its the north and the west side with less party zones. If you have any questions feel free for messaging me    Edit Some random tips . If you feel alone try to bump into travelers that are alone aswell obviously you can try to get into contact with groups but its somtimes harder to get into them a solo traveler will always appreciate it i mean maybe he feels alone aswell at this current moment. A other option is to sleep in hostels because you sleep in the same room with a few other people you obviously dont ignore them the whole day.  . In Thailand is a different weather zone for example when its pretty sunny in the east of thailand it could be very rainy in the west of thailand. When i was there for  month the north and west was very rainyevery day and the east was very sunny every day. So you could look up weather informations to plan your trip better.

Arriving in March it will be the end of Summerbeginning of Autumn Fall depending on where you are in the country so your current warm clothes should do for a while long trousers sleeves jumpers etc. If youre then planning on backpacking personally Id pack light and then pick things up in NZ as you need them. Id guess that the supply of winter jackets in Hawaii is probably not at the same level as New Zealand at the beginning of winter... Also if youre on a budget think of checking out Second hand stores for items like these as since youve noted theyre well used to harsh winter weather in NZ compared to Hawaii so there should be surplus.But other than that...

That delay made me miss a train connection. So I missed an apt reservation on the other end of that. Etc. Daisy chain.Wasnt a huge deal. But I gave my schedules more slack after that. More seat of the pants in lesstouristed routes. But it was fallwinter I dont know if you could do that in summer Im just rambling now. I stayed in a mix of hostels and AirBnBs totally dependent upon whether I wanted selective privacy or immersive socialization. The price difference was negligible.

Central America as a whole is not as advanced as Europe I think you are European? and has some issues still regarding health sanitation and garbage. Thats how it is. Bocas in particular has been dealing with the influx of many more visitors in the recent  years than it was prepared for and likely has suffered a bit more on the garbage front because of these changes. However when travelling in these regions it is important to remember where you are and not to place your expectations of your own home on to  others. I have lived in Bocas and in many other areas of Central America. I understand your frustrations with the garbage but its a bigger problem than becoming an activist will solve and its not a reason to be disgusted by a place or to not want to go there.

If thats the kind of experience youre looking for you can do all that in one long day trip from Siem Reap. The reason to avoid Phuket is because everything good in Phuket can be had better elsewhere and because the bad there is really really bad. It is the seediest place Ive ever been.

Wont be enough to have conversations but itll be enough to communicate to locals what you need and hopefully enough to understand what theyre trying to say because they suck ass at pantomiming and generally just yell in your face. Make sure you stay in hostels. Try to book places that look like they have international vibes browse pics for foreigners. It increases your chances of finding Foreigners who speak some Mandarin that you can tag along with Chinese people who speak some English that you can tag along withI speak very little Mandarin.

8106074,0,t3_4q991o,It depends where in SEA youre going and what youre doing. If youre hiking a lot then youd need good socks to prevent blisters. If youre just doing the typical backpacking thing of going from place to place via bus  train and seeing the local sights then Id personally leave the giant socks at home. At this time of the year in SEA its really hot and your feet will be pretty uncomfortable in such thick socks so theyd only be useful if youre doing a lot of walking.Most people travelling in SEA tend to wear sandals  cheap flip flops so their feet dont sweat. If youre definitely wearing shoes you can get thinner socks that wont be as uncomfortable although its tough if youre leaving tomorrow. However even with thin socks your feet will still sweat!Personally I take one pair of light woolen hiking socks incase I do hike along with a few pairs of thinner bamboo  merino socks. Im not a snob so I dont mind cotton socks either if Im just bumming around just have to live with sweaty feet.,backpacking,d4r71l9,3,t5_2qpcz

8175768,0,t1_d4yo23v,No problem. Well for getting around The Philippines you have to understand they have some different ways of getting around other than the normal flights buses taxis etc. If you want to get out to some of the islands then you will have to take a bus from a major city to the closest port for your intended island. When you get to the port you will look for a place where they sell tickets to ride on what the locals call a banka basically a smaller boat that can seat a dozen more or less depending on the size that has a motor and bamboo side skirts. Then you just take that to your intended island and when you get into port you will take either a local taxi or a tricycle. A tricycle is a motorbike with a side cabin for  or  passengers. Just tell them where you are staying and they will agree or not depending on the distance and just work out a price with them. Really fun way of getting around as they are abundant on the islands and in the big cities. Try to find a place to stay that is somewhat close to the port. You would be surprised that its not as bad as you would think moving around. You just need to be patient as Filipinos run on Filipino time and tend to be late or very casual with departure times etc. If you have to make big distance in a short amount of time then obviously flying is the best way to go but in between that you will take buses taxis jeepneys which is like a local bus that goes around townsometime privately hired and tricycles. With the big cities I wouldnt suggest spending too much time in them. I mean they will have great places to eat drink party and all that but they are crazy overpopulated bad traffic and hectic but I would say  days max in any city. Not saying that there isnt great places to eat party etc in the islands and provinces but you will get a more concentrated and better choice in cities. I would say  days in Manila and  days in Cebu. Other random tips would be to pack light and be prepared for tropical heat. Always drink bottle water which is cheap and easy to find always make sure the taxis run their meter but if they are a private taxi then be clear on the price before you get in and take lots of photos as the islands and nature is so beautiful. ,backpacking,d4zir8q,2,t5_2qpcz

8287227,0,t1_d5ckan9,Here s a rough outline the only rough part is I cant remember exactly how many days we spent in each place but it should be pretty close also forgive my spelling for all of the places. Flew into Saigon and stayed there  days  flew to Hanoi and stayed there  days including an overnight trip to Ha Long Bay. We then flew from Hanoi to Vien Tien and immediately took a bus to Vien Vieng and stayed there  days this was back when it was this nuts party place  We then took a bus to Luong Prabong and stayed there maybe  days doing an elephant trip into the jungle this is a good point to make that all the cool outdoorsy jungle stuff people do in Thailand you can usually do way cheaper in Laos  so then we took a van to Chaing Mai and stayed there  days awesome place  we then took a flight to Ko Samui and then took a boat to Ko Fanon and stayed there for the full moon party and just to chill out for about  days  we then took the boat back and I think we took a bus back north and headed straight to Cambodia to do Angkor Wat  we stayed there maybe  days or so seriously once you see a few of the temples there and theyre awesome they all kinda run together after a while  then we took a bus back to Bangkok and hung out there for  or  days and flew back to the US. We spent  days there. When I talk to people about it now I tell them that in my opinion Vietnam Laos and Cambodia are all cool places and definitely worth a visit but I have no need to ever go back there. Thailand though I think is totally worth a second trip. Theres a lot to do there and its the easiest country to get around do stuff I thought.    A random thought on Cambodia  oh btw do not go see the floating city its just floating poverty the idea of it is interesting but when you get there it sucks and its not worth the trip.

You hike up three water falls and then hike around the ridge of the crater. Sharks Cove for snorkeling was incredible and not very crowded. Go to the food trucks on the north shore.  Giovannis is very popular but we went there and the shrimp shack   shrimp shack is better by a long shot. Sunset Beach and  weimea Bay on the north shore are great  not too crowded and no big waves in the summer.  Turtle beach next to weimea Bay is not good for swimming but a good place to watch the sea turtles if any are there. Kailua Bay and lanaki beach are both great.

8869607,0,t1_d7d1qeg,Too many variables to give you a concrete number but one must always plan realistically and say that should you be unable to camp or couch surf every evening then you would have to go to the next best option which is a hostel. Most hostels of decent quality and services can be had for say  Euros. Of course summer will be more depending but lets say you call it  Euros a night for accom times that by  for a month is  Euro. Then factor in food which if you chose a hostel that has free breakfast or kitchen facilities to cook in to keep it cheap. Then food from super market to maybe eating out once and a while which you should because its Europe. Call it on the cheapest side  Euro a day on the cheap side or  is for decent meals. Even if you cut that in half call it  Euros a day for a month is  Euros. Transport if you follow what most people do is stay in a place for  days then bounce and cheapest option other than hitchhiking which in some countries is cool but some are totally not done. Then a bus can be had for  Euro as well. Factor that for that model of taking a bus every th day equals roughly  bus trips a month so  times call it  Euro is  Euro a month for basic transport. So I would say  Euro a month would be an okay budget amount of money to live on simply for Europe. Ive done it for more and less just depended on my mood for when I was in Europe.  Camping could be done easily if you are more in the country side but not in cities so cancel that thought. Why not couchsurf you say? Well in my experience if you are a single travelling guy then you will have a harder time getting couchsurfing hosts over say a single travelling female or a duo with a female because most people would do it that way. I had a great couchsurfing profile with more than a dozen positive references of couch surfers Ive hosted and sent out many requests but got few replies and zero nights on someones couch through the platform. Maybe I worded my requests wrong which I honestly think were pretty good. Maybe it was just wrong timing and the host had too many requests. Or like I said previously most hosts would feel more secure hosting a female than a single travelling dude. With your statement saying that  years ago the job market was horrible. Some news for you the job market in Europe in certain parts is still very shitty. Look at a bus in London and see the diversity of people there. So many Italians Spanish Polish Croatians Bulgarians Romanians etc who are struggling to make something of themselves because of crappy non existent job security in their parts of the world. Now that being out of the way you have the massive fines that an employer would have if they took on a worker who didnt have the correct visa. Factor in that perhaps that person wouldnt speak the local language or know local customs or culture. Then if you look at it in that regard. Then perhaps finding a job in many parts of Europe would be tough without the correct paperwork or hookup before you arrived. Not saying that you couldnt find something under the table but being realistic work for a Western native English foreigner is slim as F!I was there for a good amount of time. I was there last year. I have many friends from various parts of Europe and spoke to many people from all walks and I can safely say that its a wonderful continent but it has ALOT of issues.  ,backpacking,d7e02wc,1,t5_2qpcz

10180337,0,t3_5lphwz,I have never had a problem with Wizz but only used them twice.Not sure if Wizz do it but most airlines allow you to take on one sealed bag from the duty free shops.  If you go buy a bottle of water and ask nicely for a large bag you can then fill it with bulky items like books and reseal it easy enough.If that doesnt work just try going with the bag but be at the front of the queue.  If they are going to measure your bag step out of the line and start putting on more and more clothing.  Either they will notice and realise that taking it all off again is going to delay boarding or somebody else in line without a bag will help out.  Have a plastic bag accessible and just divide the bag in half.I have had hassle with bags many times but the worst Ive got was my luggage put in the hold free of charge.  Be super friendly and polite and be prepared to wear a sleeping bag as a skirt if necessary.  Making a scene makes it unlikely they will actually check the size exactly.  I would take the risk rather than spending lots of money on checked bags or getting a new bag.,backpacking,dbxzwy7,2,t5_2qpcz

Not too cheap but two weeks is about all you need.Phillipines  most beautiful country I have seen besides New Zealand. Very cheap to eat and travel through.Myanmar  I lived here for  years and the people are the most honest and kind that I have met. You do not need much time here as the tourist infrastructure is not that great.Mongolia  this place is off the beaten path but you can see some amazing nature here and it is not too expensive either.China not too expensive and it is still one of the most interesting countries all around. Try to learn Mandarin as you travel through.Cambodia  cheap and fun and Siem Reap is cool.Colombia  safer that everyone says and very beautiful. Food is great and it is rather cheap.Peru  I spent a month here and I could easily spend another month. There is tons to do and it is beautiful.

11254148,0,t3_60lr61,Things got delayed and I had to stay an extra night in Sucre Bolivia. When she walked in and I saw her eyes my heart skipped a beat. I pushed the backpack off the bed next to mine so she could stay there and promised myself I would take her dancing that night. She left to see something with friends and I didnt see her the rest of the day.I had an early morning for work the next morning but stayed up and pretended it wasnt just to see her again. We talked all night but all I remember from that night was her eyes. They were hypnotic. We exchanged contact info before I left and said we would stay in touch the kind of empty promise you make all the time when meeting so many new people.We did keep in touch though. At first once a week I didnt have internet during the week but then more and more. I wasnt sure why she still talked to me because she was comically out of my league but when I got online I usually had a new message from her. We traded pictures told stories and talked about the Copa America near her apartment in Chile coming up in April. It was January and I was in Turkey and would soon be in Lebanon Jordan and Israel. The plan was to workaway through the Middle East and then up through Eastern Europe. I always thought about changing my plans to see her but it would have been expensive and would have taken me away from a onceinalifetime trip.I moved to Chile in March and the eyes that greeted me at the airport were every bit as perfect as I remembered them. I followed through on my old promise to myself and took her salsa dancing that night. I stayed in Santiago and worked at restaurants and hostels for six months to be with her and we spent every free minute together plus side trips to Temuco Pucon Montevideo amp Punta Del Este amp Colonia del Sacramento Valparaiso and Uyuni. They were the best seven months of my life and the first thing I think of when I think of traveling. Eventually things didnt work out. We both wanted them to but realized it wouldnt last forever and decided to rip the bandaid off and break up now instead of waiting to bond more before ending it.Its been  months but every three or four months we spend weeks planning on getting back together. Theres always a hangup. Its usually me sabotaging it by saying that she needs to come to the U.S. this time so well be even or me saying that we are headed different directions in life or some other nonsense. So we stop talking for a while and get on with life.Sometimes in that split second between when my my alarm clicks and starts buzzing I see her eyes the night we met and life is perfect.,backpacking,df7n2s2,50,t5_2qpcz
