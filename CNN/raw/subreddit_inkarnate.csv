5003857,0,t3_3jh65e,The shape of the continent looks fantastic. I think it lacks texture though Im referring to the first picture.,inkarnate,cup5hm7,2,t5_39krf
7666545,0,t3_4kb4d9,I think it looks really good . The coastlines are well made and the fracturedislands in the bottom right has always looked good to me. I have no real criticism besides adding biomes but it looks like you will get there,inkarnate,d3dn4tv,1,t5_39krf

9687959,0,t1_da6ua2q,Thanks!   I played with the font colors but it nothing seemed better than this set up. Maybe a different font for the legend would work.. ,inkarnate,da78vie,3,t5_39krf

10162106,0,t3_5lbq8i,As someone who also started creating my first map for my first DampD campaign Im curios what scale you decided to use for this map.,inkarnate,dbvxj44,1,t5_39krf

10443137,0,t3_5pjy46,You just click them and upload whatever you want. Note that youre going to need to understand a little of what happens with those additions. For example if I were to just cut a map icon from something else without cleaning it up the icon and its background would be added.Youll need to use something like paint.net to ensure what youre adding has nice empty backgrounds so that whatever objects you add are good looking. As for brushes and textures youll have to just find a square that youd like to use as an example and just add them. Those get repeated as you paint them those are mostly about personal taste and trial and error.A great tip I have is if you have an example of a map you love but wanna make your own homebrew version use that map and add it as an object stretch it over the world and then trace its outlines gt,inkarnate,dcrt71w,1,t5_39krf
10449357,0,t3_5pjty8,Well you write that you cannot use the old map style because of licensing issues  but cant you just make something similar then?I think I speak for many fans of the map tool when I say that we are very grateful that you continue to develop it but personally Id have hoped more would be added instead of old replaced by new which at the moment feels like less.,inkarnate,dcsj2z5,5,t5_39krf
11248743,0,t3_60d4vg,Amazing. Just did the same thing last week except now... seeing this mine looks bloody awful. Oh well time to remake it for the fifth time ,inkarnate,df7118b,1,t5_39krf
11261262,0,t3_60pohg,I absolutely love this! this way the map actually feels huge which is something i always wanted to accomplish. Can you tell me your work process on making this?,inkarnate,df8g47c,3,t5_39krf
