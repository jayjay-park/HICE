875468,0,t1_ch3r424,I work at one of the participating breweries the beer is donated. We also do a ton of help planning the event and hosting supportive fundraisers. To respond to some other questions sometimes the beer is purchased by the event coordinator however those tend to be the beerbrewery driven events not a non profit benefit... Edit sure at the end of the night iy much easier to break down empty kegs than partials. But if we run out because we gave away beer for free we as a brewery are costing ourselves exposure opportunity. I think there is a time and place for the free beer scavenging stategy but perhaps a non profit benefit isnt that...All that said I hope everyone who brewed poured volunteered and attended had a good time.,Bellingham,ch3sm9g,5,t5_2r6yo

I used to pay  a month now its  or  depending on the options you buy into. If you have a plan on what to do youll be able to substitute different workouts if you dont want to wait for people. No contract you can quit anytime you want i pay  a month annual fee of  i never paid initiation fee because i have been a member before they changed the brand name. on the pushy trainers part thats probably because Fit Evo dont employ personal trainers. Compel trainers are their own business inside the gym. Theyve never bothered me if they see somebody having a hard time or dont know what to do I would assume they would approach you and see if they can help you out I dont they will bother you once you say no and your okay with what your doing.Also been a member at City gym only lasted there for  months hated the equipment weight plates dont match with the bars makes them shake and vibrate when you push or pull even if you use lock em with collars when your at your limit and going for your potential power its critical i felt it wasnt safe i dont train with a spotter all the time.Bellingham Athletic club is a more complete gym if you want to swim play raqcuetball sauna hot tub smaller weight room though havent been in there in years they have one close to downtown and  pool is on the Guide Meridian branch not sure how many people go there now though i think since its a smaller weight room it would get crowded too.Been a member of  YMCA too bout  years ago Bellingham had less people then and it was busy i cant imagine how bury it gets there now.Bellingham Fitness i havent been to in over  years too it used to be Worlds gym. ,Bellingham,ci9jz7m,1,t5_2r6yo

They were out the one time I stopped by so I cant vouch for them myself. Cascade Pizza Rudys Pizzazza Dominoes all have GF crusts. The Table has GF pasta. Jekyll amp Hyde has GF pizza and bread though I dont recommend the bread. I had a bad experience with the quality of it at the James location. Only the Orchard one has pizza. Man Pies has a GF crust pot pie. Its been ages since Ive been to one but Olive Garden has at least one GF pasta. On Rice has GF options with specific GF sauces made as subs. My celiac friend also eats there. I know she also likes Brandywine. I am mentioning her experiences specifically because shes also celiac but please know that they dont eat out much because shes also dairy and egg free. Old Town Cafe has GF options for breakfast Mount Bakery has buckwheat crepes. Woods Coffee has a GF breakfast sandwich.Personally Im not a fan of Bellingham Flat Bread amp Bakerys gluten freeer options.

5259440,0,t3_3myrl0,I live near the airport so I cannot walk to any of the downtown bars and even many of my friends houses who live near downtown or Western.  Having Uber up here would make my weekends less stressful and safer.  Ive used the service a decent amount in Seattle and absolutely love it.  My only concern up here is that there would be a lack of business hurting the driver pool.  Im not sure that the weekend bar rush in Bellingham would be enough to sustain a large force of drivers which would mean longer waits and a less satisfactory service. ,Bellingham,cvjy9r0,6,t5_2r6yo

I tried the bacon bison burger and a beer thats a hybrid between an IPA and a darker brew not sure what kind exactlyporter? stout?. Really really pleased with both. The bison wasnt as flavorful as the bison I once had in Kansas but Im not sure why... If its something to do with the specific kind of bison or something to do with the preparation of the meat? But in spite of that relative difference it was still delicious. And a very friendly bartender too. So thanks for pointing me in the right direction! ,Bellingham,cx6n40k,2,t5_2r6yo
