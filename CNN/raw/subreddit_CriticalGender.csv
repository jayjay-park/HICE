148880,1,t3_1vsieb,On the same thread SisterCoffee asksgtI mean how do they know that they are really stealth?Were not the idiots youve made us out to be.  Most of us stealth girls have had a period during our transition where we were androgynous looking and people were obviously confused by our gender expression. A common reaction for such confused people was to err on the side of addressing me as sir. In some cases the confused person might have been trying to reinforce my evaporating masculinity as if they were doing me a favor. Others did it out of policing my gender as if they were trying to expose me. Nobody ever sirs me now out of pity nor out of policing. I dont get those confused looks anymore. Thugish looking men who are likely homophobic sometimes get into my personal bubble to flirt with me and act like Im supposed to be attracted to them. Women who I dont know will start conversations with me in a way which never happened when I was passing for a guy.There are all kinds of ways in which people treat me differently now that its obvious Im a woman. Bathrooms are a good example. Before I went full time I was still wearing masculine clothes if any guy saw me in the mens room he would say something whether he thought I was in the wrong bathroom or he was. But in the womens room people dont even look at me twice. The best way of knowing Im stealth is when I come out to someone in the LGBT community after knowing them for a while and they are shocked. Those instances are the most fun because people in the community assume they are so knowledgeable about these things. The funny thing is that I dont wear makeup or pluck my eyebrows or do any of that stuff. It just naturally look like a woman. I consider myself very lucky.  ,CriticalGender,cevdziq,1,t5_2ynyz
2957294,0,t1_co3wfrm,It is certainly true that cis feminists are often subjected to harassment because they are willing to speak out against patriarchy. The trans people who harass Cathy Brennan may have a right to feel outrage but they have no right to express their outrage in such an unproductive and even harmful way. I had intended my statement to be more reflective of the specific oppression I face as a trans woman. I did not intend to erase the harassment which cis feminists are often subjected to. Thank you for calling me out on that point.,CriticalGender,co49c4y,1,t5_2ynyz
