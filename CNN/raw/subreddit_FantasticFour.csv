I actually liked the Galactus cloud  the world wasnt ready for a giant purple Planet Eater. Maybe after ThanosThe new trailer definitely has an Ultimate Fantastic Four vibe going on  its the F but not as we know them. I can get behind that  it could work Ill give it a go.Im sad to see the book going  but its all just a matter of time before its back.,FantasticFour,co4z7aw,1,t5_2vqs3

When a film doesnt have a second act barely sets up its characters has little motivation for any of them... there are just so many things that this film did that are wrong. Objectively wrong when making a movie.And then it fails as a movie then I cant see why anyone would disagree with the general consensus other than to be contrarian.,FantasticFour,cu9o8en,3,t5_2vqs3
