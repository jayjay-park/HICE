288653,0,t1_cf9gfkb,The idea is that. The wallet recommends a best guess for the fee based on network data. It can also give you a best guess as to how long a specific fee level will take until it gets included.. The full nodes are less judgmental about what transactions they will or wont relay at least as far as the fee is concerned.The big upside is that we wont rely on hardcoded fees which are silly especially when the price doubles.,BitcoinSerious,cfaolya,2,t5_2wxbp

441156,0,t3_1z4o53,They cant eliminate it but they can make life more difficult by preventing banks and money service businesses from dealing in it without verification that its not being used for money laundering. This is happening right now in the U.S. It cuts off the flow of blood or much of it by making fiatgtBTC exchange more difficult. But theres enough momentum that once these statelevel regulations do come out beginning with NY there are likely to be some banks jumping ship and embracing BTC transactions within that regulatory framework. And also there is a lot of venture capital money going into Bitcoinrelated wallets exchanges hedge funds and other infrastructure at some point that innovation and associated political contributions will speak just as loud as the banks. Perhaps we are past the tipping point or have not reached it quite yet but when one or two banks or large retailers jump in the dominoes should start falling into place pretty quickly. ,BitcoinSerious,cfqho4l,8,t5_2wxbp
532059,1,t1_cg0lel6,gt The smear has come from the series of serious fuck upsNot entirely.  Some of the smear is deliberate consistent and independent of serious fuck ups although theyre certainly glad to leverage them.  The poster boy for that right now has to be Professor Bitscorn who positions himself as a bitcoin expert  see   always willing to warn the masses about bitcoins risks inadequacies and impeding demise.More subtly you get articles like Beware Bitcoin U.S. brokerage regulator which is essentially a summary of bitcoin bad news.  However within the list next to the Mt Gox implosion you get the Imogo story. Wait who the hell is Imogo? FINRA mentioned that they had announced testing of something bitcoinrelated. Well trading of Imogos securities was suspended for  weeks Did that suspension have anything to do with bitcoin? Theres no indication of it. But FINRA was very willing to make the link nonetheless and every news story about FINRAs warning dutifully repeats it.   Similar the Balanced Energy llc story is mentioned. This is almost entirely about selling unregistered securities but thanks to the Texas Securities Boards PR work is now solidly anchored as an antibitcoin story providing the story a great deal more attention than it otherwise would have.Now Im willing to accept that folks doing this arent necessarily against bitcoin and just trying to cash in on the instant media attention that a mere mention of bitcoin provides.  Still theres a clear tendency to associate negative events to bitcoin when there is only the most tenuous of link to be found.,BitcoinSerious,cg0r30q,2,t5_2wxbp

3816459,0,t3_3433g6,Im not sure of your level of bitcoin knowledge or the level of your question but on the face of it it is feasible.  I have a piece of paper with some bitcoin private keys written on it.  Knowledge of those keys is necessary and sufficient to control the bitcoins they contain.  It could happen that that paper is discovered in  years and used to access my bitcoins assuming that cryptography hasnt advanced massively by then.  Instead of paper I could have used electronic storage.  I just felt that paper was more secure.If you havent done it I recommend that you get a bitcoin wallet and a small amount of bitcoin.  The process really helps you to understand the technology in a visceral way.  The next level is to store some coin in a paper wallet and retrieve it.,BitcoinSerious,cqrb246,1,t5_2wxbp
