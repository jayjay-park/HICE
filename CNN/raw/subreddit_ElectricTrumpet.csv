Im pretty sure the reason you dont see people using these live is how prohibitive extended playing with a practice mute is. On the other hand Im sure it would give a strong isolated signal that would process well. The other benefit would be the ability to have a  wet signal in live situations. I wish someone would come to the table with a microphone integrated mute but focused on better playability rather than just sound reduction. A decent clip on mic would be more portable and sound better for the same money.,ElectricTrumpet,d8226ix,2,t5_38hl5

Where do the other elements come from then are you playing keyboard at the same time?  My critique on the volume was more of a minor nitpick than a real gripe it sounds great asis particularly if this was all mixed and taped on the fly!  Id love to hear more stuff like this if youre cranking it out D ,ElectricTrumpet,dg5zenp,1,t5_38hl5

Sometime when youre creating a new soundscape similar to this you ought to film yourself to show how youre getting to this level of density.  Id be interested to watch that.  Way cool stuff!!,ElectricTrumpet,dgb5aw5,2,t5_38hl5
