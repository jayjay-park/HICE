Most people in my class have shorter code but too be honest my code isnt very complicated it just has much more validations and options than other people in my class which is probably why its longer. It also gives more options for everything like whether or not they would like to read the file. My validation is efficient because I did it in  line but I am not sure on how I can make it any shorter. My task  is the shortest one.Thanks for the help.,GCSE,cqhrrob,1,t5_2u3gk

4119049,0,t3_37txz3,Right well I think this is really good  you used a wide range of appropriate language your grammar was good and it seems to me like a highband response.Personally I just try to make my language techniques over the top without fail every paragraph of mine will have a rhetorical device alliteration humour selfreflection etc I think the use of these techniques have helped me to achieve higher grades just because the examiner is more aware that I am using them. I feel that you should do the same just to be sure you hit those top marks.Additionally search DAFOREST on Google its an acronym for all of the core language techniques you should use to get an AA grade  that really helped me out.Read a few articles before the exam and just take  minutes to study a few of them. While your response would most likely get you a high mark as it is the mark scheme is looking for an answer that seems without a doubt written for its intended purpose. Your response seems perhaps too informal with slightly too many personal opinions. I think that in future responses it would aid you to tackle both sides of the argument in a more formal way.Honestly Im nitpicking here your answer would definitely get a high mark. English Language is really just giving the examiner what they want to hear and thats all down to how many marks they can award you for each technique used. ,GCSE,crpspei,2,t5_2u3gk

4389441,0,t3_3b8ggg,As you said it doesnt matter in the end because GCSEs are a test of basic information retention. However the way you handled the situation says something about the way you react to challenging situations and hopefully you can keep this in mind for the future when other tests wont be so easy and you will HAVE to revise and resist cheating.Also the way I see it is the following if your results on these tests didnt matter in the end then the only variable in the process of exams was your attitude and what virtues you value. Even though you claim that the tests werent important you still gave in to pressure and whilst you could have gotten away with honestly doing the exams by the best of your abilities you chose to cheat.Sure you dont feel guilty but if you didnt cheat GCSEs could have been a big stepping stone in your life a sort of rite of passage where you can prove your competence.Now Im not trying to be morally superior with this comment because in the end you didnt do much harm if you dont do those subjects in the future. But this is the way I see the situation.,GCSE,cskfcru,1,t5_2u3gk
