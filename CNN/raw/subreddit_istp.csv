1277555,0,t3_28p1ng,Based on some of the comments here I think it would be good to clarify something that might lead to a bit more discussion. Theres probably a bunch here that already know this stuff but its useful to bring up.I know for the most part on the internet we like to pick and choose each letter in a type to determine the type we are or take a test that does something similar. However this isnt the most accurate way of finding a type and its a little misleading to say someone can lean towards one type or another if we have that model in mind. Of course we can always compare ourselves to other types and their traits but its different than just replacing a letter. The letters represent functions and its a little deeper than just say introverted sensing thinking perceiving for an ISTP. What those letters are actually saying is the strongest function in this case is an introverted one and the strongest extroverted function is a perceiving one. So in order of strength introverted thinking extroverted sensing introverted intuition extroverted feeling notice the two weaker functions are the ones not noted in the name ISTP. INTPs are similar to us in that they share our strongest and weakest functions. We are both introverted thinkers we both suck at extroverted feeling. This is likely why so many ISTPs have identified as INTP in the past or why we continue to see some similarities. Its important to note that our middle functions are different INTPs have extroverted intuition and introverted sensing in that order. ESTPs share the same functions as us in a different order extroverted sensing introverted thinking extroverted feeling introverted intuition. Personally I find it much easier to understand ESTPs because of this I think the extroverted intuition can throw me way off when dealing with INTPENTP. I dont know how common it is for an ISTP to mistake themselves as or really relate to an ESTP since we tend to be so quiet. I love the outdoors sports going to the gym etc but I am very quiet for the most part I dont think I could ever be mistaken for an extrovert. However we share the same functions. Like many others I first mistyped myself as an INTP and I think the similarities in thinking and feeling go a long way. We can be pretty different though. Maybe we dont realize it because both types arent necessarily ones to show their thoughts.,istp,cidcc2k,6,t5_2r39c

3793104,0,t1_cqomfdj,gtOf course youd be an intuitive if you werent an istpWell no. After those two Id say possibly an ISFP.gtWhy would you ever admit to being a boring common type such as an istj?I find ISTPs to be boring. I have no problems with ISTJs they just arent me. Though Im curious at why youd think all of my functions would change. TiSe to SiTe. Doesnt make much sense.gtAnd how would you jump from istp to an intp or infj anyway?Well an INFJ has the same functions just in a different order. Ive had tests mistype me as INFJ as well. Its not too far of a stretch. I dont think its quite right though which is why Im not INFJ.INTP I actually mistyped as for years. It was only once I started talking with INTPs and generally interacting with them that I realized Im not an INTP. Particularly worth noting is the TiDomFeinf fits me perfectly.gtThe disconnect and differences between the three are massive.And yet you say ISTJ is close? Have you even met an ISTJ? Im curious as to why you think Im an ISTJ.To quickly summarize how I arrived at ISTP you just need to look at the functionsTiFe vs TeFi Im pretty obviously TiFe. As is most of my friend circles. And its easy to see that Im not particularly Fedom which leaves Tidom or aux with Fe inf or ter.SeNi vs NeSi Here again its pretty obvious that Im not NeSi. I typically have huge problems with Si users and Ne users typically drive me crazy. Ni is apparent. Se is really the only oddball but still fits.So we have TiFe and NiSe. That gives us either ESTP way nope ISTP perhaps INFJ close or ENFJ nope. The E types are out since Im too reserved to be an ESTP and to cold to be an ENFJ. Which leaves ISTPINFJ. And as you mentioned Im not an INFJ though I considered it. Which leaves ISTP.INTP shares Tidom and generally a similar order just flipping SeNi with NeSi. And INFJ shares functions but in a different order NiFe vs TiSe. Which is why Id say those types are close.ISFP while I dont think matches on functions has a general appearance that I could see describing myself.To quickly run through the other S typesISTJ  I explained why this doesnt work.ISFJ  Nope again. ESFP ESTP ESTJ ESFJ No Im not an extroverted type.ISFP  possible but I dont think so.ISTP  This is the type I concluded.Any other S type is a stretch. If its about admitting that Im a boring S type or boring common type I wouldnt have said Im an ISTP one of the more common types. Id have said Im an INTJ or some shit since thats the rare awesome type.To cover the Ns to show its not just wanting to be an NINTP INFJ These are what I said are possible.INTJ Lolno.ENTP Not really. My brothers an ENTP and the differences are clear.ENFP No again. Im just not that type of person.ENFJ Lawl.INFP More than minor spats. Clearly not an INFP.ENTJ Nope.As I said my type if anything is either an ISTP INFJ or INTP. Perhaps ISFP if you want to push it.Though Im all ears if you want to explain why Im an ISTJ.,istp,cqon77u,0,t5_2r39c

Determining by observation whether someone else who is an introvert is an N or S can be challenging though Ill make an exception for ISTJs because they have a certain situational fastidiousness that makes them distinct from other IT types.  I dont exactly know why but people often confuse INTJs and INTPs.  The main distinguishing factor between INTPs and ISTPs apart from obvious discussions about Ne vs. Se seems to be that the latter are more focused on some particular domain whereas the former tend to generalize.  This can be a subtle distinction that is hard to understand or notice for outside observers.  They definitely have a lot of overlap with Ti being primary.,istp,cs3mtu2,2,t5_2r39c

4452056,0,t3_3c1v3z,Things like this are why I really do just think most relationships are a bit of a joke. You list five or six different ways that he expresses his love for you in this post. And its not exactly a long post. And youre freaking out because he hasnt said I love you and the only reason youre freaking out about it is because like...is it normal for somebody to not say I love you is this what other couples do? ooh errrr. Miles Davis who was ISTP he said look man I like people. I love people! Im not going around telling everybody that. I try to say that my way  with my horn.If I had to guess I reckon that your boyfriend is to some extent deliberately withholding saying I love you to you because he figures that anybody could say that at any time and it is meaningless and he wants to see whether youre capable of loving him for his actual character rather than merely his ability to act out the relationship script that you have in your head. Im sure if you accept him for who he is then he wont have any issues with commitment but right now...like I say it seems to me more like you just want somebody who will follow like the standard conventional relationship script where the guy says the exact right things at the exact right times and so on. Its okay for you to want this I suppose but bloody hell pick a type other than ISTP to play it out for you.,istp,csrv6wc,4,t5_2r39c

As far as convoy stuff went since you mentioned it I was never a driver I was usually just in the back of an MRAP or ton as an attachment never had a front seat POV so when a vehicle would break down and make the convoy stop for hours that could be stressful though I admit nothing serious ever happened in those cases.

TLDR of the following because Im on adderal and I was rambling Former bosses wife asked me how I felt about having to work so much while being in college and work getting in the way of school. I replied I dont. She misinterpreted my apathy for the undesirable yet necessary situation as not giving a shit about my job. Shit storm ensues I desperately try to explain to her that I understand that the situation sucks but it is reality. Rambling versionSource My former bosses wife asked me how I felt about having to work so damn much while in college. I just replied I dont. Shit storm ensued. She thought I didnt care about the job. I spent like  minutes trying to explain to her that my apathy towards my workload was not because I didnt care about my job but because the workload was necessary for the company to survive and there was no one else who could pick up the slack. It was perfectly reasonable for me to be requires to do all what I did because when I gave them my school schedule I vastly underestimated my workload for school and therefore overestimated how much I could work. Due to the nature of the job it would have been difficult to hire someone else to pick up the slack for various reasons. It was my fault that my workload was enough to get in the way of school so now I have to deal with it. Feelings are irrelevant in this scenario. The workload that was required of me was of my own doing and I was not wronged in any way because of another person. That was just the way it was going to have to be for a while. Sure it was a bad thing but it was reality of the situation. It is what it be and thats just the way it do. ,istp,cx5wid4,4,t5_2r39c

Theres a big difference between clapping along to a song because its fun to be one of a couple thousand people doing it and making bad decisions to fit in with a collective. Usually in situations where it is socially demanded to participate in something perhaps ridiculous but ultimately harmless like your boss trying to pump everyone up it is much better to make a show of participating than to stand out as someone who thinks theyre too cool to take part. The ultimate repercussions to your work life could be worse than just having to look like an idiot for a few minutes with everyone else.

I swear to fucking gawd I will not even lay a fucking finger on you back!

I dont know if its because what I consider a strong feeling is actually weak compared to how others feel or if its a matter of not being as concerned with that level of information. I was reading some of Jungs writing about thinking and feeling and he said that thinking kindof overrides feeling if youre thinking youre not feeling. So if you consider someone whose main function is thinking that would happen most of the time. But if what Jung wrote is true I think that would mean the feelings exist and are capable of being strong they would just be overridden by thinking most of the time in terms of the persons focus.Sorry if this isnt really relevant. ,istp,d2nl9lr,1,t5_2r39c

Im texting her once a day on fb which is how I know shes checking.Yeah maybe leave her alone for at least  to  days without initiating contact. It might give her time to organize her thoughts and not pop a vein when she thinks about it. Also the repeated text once a day when she clearly doesnt answer may be perceived by her as badgering or nagging.gtHow should I approach her for this behaviour?If you want to discuss it discuss the logistical problem here and ask her what she thinks the better solution for everyone might be. Be dispassionate and ask short precise questions.You can state your discomfort with her outburst behavior but dont try to fix it by talking to her. Youre not her parent and if she thinks youre lecturing her shell rightfully hate you for it.The relationship between her and her dad should stay that way its not your place to interfere even if you badly want to help. If you cant help yourself talk to your stepdad about it give him support and ask him for permission if you want to help smooth over their relation. But dont talk to her about her relation to her dad shell rip your head off for that.gtMy current method has degenerated into sending her cute animal videos periodically until she feels like talking to me again. YN?Yikes. Stop that. See advice .gtYour thoughts on what might be going on her mind?She probably feelsfelt violated in her intimate space and is pissed about having no control over it. Shes very young was taken by surprise and lashed out.gtAnd your opinion. Evaluate this situation my actions what have you. Anxiety makes this all feel exhausting so outside insight rather than me thinking in circles is much appreciated.Its not the end of the world everyone will live youre both young and anger is fleeting youll still be a family after that.

10166979,0,t3_5lk7ay,Personally I dont particularly use Ni at all. Certainly not on any conscious level at least. If you want to get ISTPs as an INTP its more likely Se that you have to understand. Imagine a world where all of your senses are kicked into overdrive well call them super senses for sake of helping you get it but I am exaggerating a bit with that where you hear doors close across houses or can tell from the smell of the air if its likely to rain. And thats just how the external world is all the time. You cant turn it off or turn down the volume. Thats Se. Combine it with Ti and you end up with a person with a strong desire to take actioninteract with their immediate environment because of a need to do something with the constant stream of data Se is collecting. Ni is just this sort of thing that maybe gives you a hunch to poke at when Ti and Se hit a brick wall or something.My impression of INTPs is that you start with an idea and then look for the data to back it up. ISTPs start with observable data and then form ideas from that data. So I guess its sort of your reverse or mirror image. Thats my impression from limited interaction with INTPs anyway.,istp,dbwhed6,12,t5_2r39c
10250984,0,t1_dc58g2r,Most mental disorders are ends of a spectrum.  Thats why some people are mildly obsessive and compulsive without an OCD diagnosis it doesnt interfere with their lives and isnt vital to treat.  That said ISTJs are very commonly obsessive about shit.  Their degree of obsessiveness determines OCD or not.  Ive never met an ISTJ that wasnt obsessively controlling about some random arbitrary bullshit.Further I think you can cook down almost any disorder to which cognitive functions it involves or interferes with.  I bet OCD is most commonly found in SJ types for example.  Borderlinebipolar in FP types autism in IT types Narcissism in IJ types and so on.  Mental disorders arent some magical fairy manifestations in random people... they are a collection of temperament behaviors and beliefs aka symptoms that reflect on ones mental health.  I say this as a psych major who is clinically diagnosed with a personality disorder and have known countless others with personality disorders through my path to recovery. This is all speculation but probably worth consideration.,istp,dc607f8,2,t5_2r39c

Its pretty general but describes people pretty well.I dont think anybody can really change. You can learn think differently act differently use more cognitions... But you still stay who you are.

11289722,0,t3_612p90,I find small talk horrendously boring but then I also find myself from time to time starting with small talk particularly when something like politics or the weather or TV has had some noteworthy effect on me.  Sometimes it leads somewhere sometimes it doesnt.I too have had an absolute hell of a time learning how to be socially nonawkward how to talk to both genders how to be persuasive how to project the right kind of image.  I love kinesics and have read all the greats and continue to.  In fact I mod and have produced some high quality content over at rbodylanguage.   Come take a look.  But as for your passive misanthropy which is really the issue I think you are struggling with  not the lack of knowledge but perhaps the lack of stimulus in conversations  Im not going to try to fix you or analyse you or critique you.  I just want to open this up and see exactly what youre frustrated with.  Conversations can be boring they can be irrelevant they can be nagative or they can be emotionallycharged with the kind of emotions you dont want to relate to or about situations you arent interested in or about experiences or opinions which either you dont relate to or have no desire for.  I think these outcomes are typical ISTP frustrations which make us not want to participate.  I feel like If Im not going to learn anything useful from this or be challenged with a new perspective I really dont want to bother.So if you will allow me to engage with youYou can let your mind begin to wander to a recent time you had a conversation that left you feeling misanthropic or annoyed or just outoftouch.  How did it go?  Can you remember the words or pivotal moments enough to maybe give us a breakdown of what was said?  Maybe just the key bits where you felt like the dynamic changed and boy this sucks was the feeling.,istp,dfbo9ie,3,t5_2r39c

11493449,0,t3_640kg9,Its natural for an ISTP to be bored of lazily hanging out  I dont think we crave society for its own sake.  We crave experiences and challenges and without challenging friends theres no growth happening in that context.I am nearly certain its an effect of his relationship with his parents  in his early life which has left him feeling at least partially like why bother? with the duties difficulties and struggles of being in a committed relationship with another human being.  To me I cant imagine what could be more of a challenge than trying to manage a real relationship.  Thats where real growth happens.  I doubt he feels that way  and maybe lack of experience is the cause.  Maybe he doesnt know his own value and what he has to offer?  Maybe with a low sex drive he sees no endgoal to an oppositesex relationship?  I didnt in my s...Im ISTP and my parents also broke up I was  and I never really knew my father.  As a result I grew up with a moreorless surrogate father an uncle who was more a responsible friend  big brother type than a parent and masculine shaper.  I had to learn many things in life on my own.But I get the feeling.  If it seems like a lot of hassle and he doesnt feel like theres a gain to it then see how he responds to the following questions.  The parentheses portion is for you to know only Whose love did he crave more growing up Mother or Father?   How did he have to act as a child in order to be rewarded with that love that he craved from the parent?  What behavior pattern is he playing out that is perhaps not relevant to his current situation? What is to gain by being in a relationship with real investment real struggle and real feelings?  What he hopes to achieve What is to lose by putting yourself into a real relationship with real risksrewards?  What hes avoiding What does one gain by staying out of a relationship?   this is called the Secondary gainHere you will find some of the core values needs and hangups Id only call a hangup a hangup if he knows he desires X but something is holding him back from pursuing X  I have a feeling the divorce and some latent guilt is holding him back  he may feel like he is toxic to relationships entirely and has avoided them in order to reduce damaging anyone else.  We ISTPs would sooner leave than be a burden or a drain or a negative influence on a situation.  I hope those questions give you a picture of what hes stuck with.  It might be that hes never really thought about some of these either  if so maybe they will help him see something hes never seen a connection a misunderstanding a limiting belief of his own that he needs to challenge.Share your own answers to those questions if he clams up and doesnt want to talk.  If he says something new ask more questions about how he felt about that thing what it meant to him etc.  You get the idea.,istp,dfys55r,6,t5_2r39c
