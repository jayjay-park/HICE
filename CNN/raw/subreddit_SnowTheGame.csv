4832733,0,t1_cu2ndex,There is an issue with leveling and Drop Point unlocking  at some point last week we broke it by mistake and are looking into a fix. Sorry for the inconvenience  I totally appreciate that it must be frustrating to not have access to the entire mountain now.Rest assured it doesnt take long to unlock the different back country areas once the unlocking actually works. Since youre so experienced with the game you should be able to unlock most of the areas in  minutes. The few remaining heli drops are locked by level but shouldnt take that long if youre good at landing tricks and make sure to save your XP at the end session points scattered around the mountain.There are  main reasons behind the decision to make different types of drop points and lock some of them. First we need to make sure the game has things for players to do. Sure like you I just love free roaming for hours and finding new lines and hitting them until I land a perfect run. But for other players especially new ones they need to be given things to do. Hence why we have spent time on challenges events and drop points in free roam. Secondly new players are usually terrible at the game and there is a risk they will give up if they dont catch on with the controls. If they start learning to ski at the summit or in the backcountry areas they are going to have a hard time learning. So we provide a simple unlock system so they dont initially begin skiing in the hardest places on the mountain.I appreciate that you are frustrated but I urge you to look at the game from a new players perspective. We cant give everyone everything all the time but make every decision with a long discussion on how itll affect our core players. Thanks again for your feedback!,SnowTheGame,cu3penw,4,t5_2yczu

7980666,0,t1_d4cwn88,No problem I think thats its a great idea to do that. Thanks for explaining it.,SnowTheGame,d4d3ocr,1,t5_2yczu

9016822,0,t1_d7ucn0d,Yeah weve seen most of these issues coming from Australia. I think it might have to do with the ISPs over there... ,SnowTheGame,d7vojrv,1,t5_2yczu
9649448,0,t3_5d680f,I was going to suggest get perfect landings but it seems thats what you want to learn. Im not one whos done the events but perhaps if youre doing too complicated tricks and getting bad landings then try try simpler tricks and get perfect landings.,SnowTheGame,da2hsyj,2,t5_2yczu
9978988,0,t1_db7swbd,hey fyi Ive noticed this too and it happens when I have my controller plugged into my PC.  For some reason Im pretty sure it uses the controller as a priority while ignoring many of the keyboard commands usually just on the UI screens  But yea I thought I was locked to certain settings until I tried the dpad on my controller.  Are you using a controller by any chance?  ,SnowTheGame,db8agsf,1,t5_2yczu
