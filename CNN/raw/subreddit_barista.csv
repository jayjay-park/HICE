If you dont live in a cheaplivable city with the sort of cafes that can afford to pay baristas over minimum and where baristas are actually respected learn everything you know about coffee and make it a part of your lifestyle so you can be an asset to a team in wholesale roasting sales education etc. or get entrepreneurial. ,barista,cg65yvz,2,t5_2s4zn

2995960,0,t3_2uh21g,. Youre correct. Youre not incorporating your milk enough. Did you let your milk sit for too long? You shouldnt be able to differentiate the milk from the foam as they should be well mixed together.. Latte art is possible because of the foam. When you start your pour because youre starting so high the heavier milk will drop before the lighter foam which pushes the foam towards the back of the pitcher. This is why you get that huge glob of foam after you finish pouring your milk. Can be fixed by getting a really good swirl as you steam. Again incorporation.. Another way to incorporate after the fact is by pouring the milk into another pitcher then pour it back into the first pitcher and give it a good swirl! Pour wise you look like youre on your way. Its mainly the lack of foam when you start your pour that prevents you from getting that good latte art start.Good luck!,barista,co8j1yr,3,t5_2s4zn

4144472,0,t1_crso99x,lol this is what my flat whites look like on a good day anyway. Still a bit of foam but much less than a cap.Also keep in mind that every single cap Ive ever seen in Australia and Ive lived here my whole life has chocolate sprinkles on top. They might be shaving of the finest chocolate or they might just be hot chocolate powder. Good places will still do latte art but theyll pour it through the chocolate What people tend to forget when they get all uppity about how the stupid Australians are just being pretentious with their fancy names for whats just a cap latte thing I make anyway is that our caps are very different to American caps and they have a much stronger Italian influence that means a very dry cap with quite stiff foam is often the standard thats changing now though with american influence. Caps have a beautiful frothy chocolaty head flat whites have a smooth creamy layer above the coffee. Both are delicious but I prefer the latter.Basically it comes down to this in my experience Caps are the same size or slightly larger than flat whites Caps have chocolate sprinkles flat whites dont Caps have enough foam that you can give them a fairly significant wobble and they dont spill flat whites can still take some wobbling but not as much the foam on a cap is also more likely to be in a slight dome shape over the top of the cup preferably because its super dense microfoam while for flatties it sits level with the top of the cup,barista,crsoqjj,5,t5_2s4zn

11035374,0,t3_5x5hn4,Doppio  only became a popular term because of Starbucks.  The  years I worked doing coffee at several shops and houses I had never heard this term.  I took  years off making coffee and started again  months ago and now the term is common but even after years of ordering coffee I didnt know about it.  So someone not knowing the term doesnt mean their inexperienced they just might not be up to date on the Starbucks lingo they need to when dealing with customers.,barista,deiu2tu,0,t5_2s4zn

They have so much support that it feels like Im walking on clouds. They are a bit expensive but my employer covered the cost of mine. They cost NOKusd here in Norway.They breathe well and have an antislip sole as well! The seller said that after  steps you have circulated in all new air into the shoes.,barista,deyitm5,1,t5_2s4zn

Right now Im just splitting off the  with a  converter and have never had a problem with it in years. Im leaning towards ordering another GS today but still wondering if the  power would allow the steam boiler to rebound a lot quicker than the GSs on ? ,barista,df6aao0,1,t5_2s4zn

11570034,0,t3_64npdn,For a barista in a highvolume setting the major difference is the autovolumetric on the PB. When things get busy and youve got a line of drinks paying perfect attention to getting consistent pulls on the EP becomes difficult because the barista has to manually stop the shot. With the Linea you program the ratio you want and it automatically stops. Therefore the barista can be busy finishing or starting other drinks without the worry of forgetting not being able to stop the shot on time. Your shots in the Linea WILL be the same each time. Your shots on the Strada CAN be so long as you are always on it. That being said Ive worked extensively on both and theyre both amazing machines. Just boils down to preference. EP is mostly for the enjoyment of the barista playing with paddles. I like it but I think its an unnecessary feature when you have machines that automatically do the same thing without human error. If youre pressure profiling thats a different story though ,barista,dg7gw8k,1,t5_2s4zn
