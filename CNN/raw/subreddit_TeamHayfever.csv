7148544,0,t3_4d6zx3,Hello!F  SW lbs CW lbs GW lbsMy name is Lauren and this is my first time doing this challenge so Im not really sure what to expect. I lost lbs last year and managed to keep it off but then just kind of stopped. In January this year I decided that I just had to do it now or it would maybe never happen. My first goal was to be at lbs before my th birthday but now Im kind of hoping to be there by the end of this challenge! Would definitely like some accountability and motivation to keep pushing when Id rather just shove some candy in my face.I work  near Toronto with an hours commute each way so I spend a lot of time sitting on my bum. My husband is on team Pollen so were going to do this together! I am vegetarian as well so we have been having fun coming up with some creative new recipes. Most recently we have been learning curries.I am excited! Lets do this!,TeamHayfever,d1qpspg,11,t5_3dwqu

7236168,0,t3_4e3zi1,This is a great idea! I am going to reward myself every  lbs lost. I would really like a tattoo on my rib area but am very self conscious about my back fat so Ill put that as my goal reward! I also struggle with compulsive shopping so Im hoping if I reward myself for weight loss with clothingmakeup I can stop the mindless shopping!,TeamHayfever,d20p7gd,2,t5_3dwqu
