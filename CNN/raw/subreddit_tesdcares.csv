856227,0,t1_ch1e9ht,You do realize that most stereotypes exist because there is some kernel of truth behind them?  The girls toys are there because girls feel motherly instincts and a lot of the toys are designed for their target demographic.  As a kid growing up I remember a lot of girls naming pink as their favorite color and a lot of boys naming blue. I assume this is because those colors are associated with things you are fond of. Its not often we see a pink sports car and I dont think that is because of gender stereotypes I think that is because a lot of men simply dont fancy pink all that much.  And why dont they? Who knows? Maybe its because for millions of years men have been out scavenging food in blue and green environments? The women stayed home and took care of their pink babies.  What Im trying to say is that millions of years of evolution has brought us here most of what we like is programmed into our brains so it doesnt matter if girls grow up in a blue environment and boys grow up in a pink because our brains already know what we like and what we feel safe in.,tesdcares,ch1lweo,2,t5_2ubha

1491692,0,t1_cj34i34,The only posts and comments that get removed on rtesdcares are ones that are completely offensive and intrude on the private lifes of the TESD crew. The last post I removed directly linked to Debbie Chens personal Facebook page and urged users  to get involved to contact her about Ming Chens Affair with Zen Librarian... Other posts have included Qs personal love life with pictures of his ex girlfriend claiming how hot she was and other things which was discussed in such a horrible stalkerish tone and also Brys personal struggle with addiction but that post wasnt very positive and the discussion involved was blatantly back and forward insults to basically everyone TESD crew and users of this subreddit. Also constant bitching about Bry which is completely wrong and moaning when an episode is late doesnt look good for this subreddit. We are better than that.This subreddit has these rules for good reasons. To tell you the truth theres a good reason why we have Gitem here we have creaky here and many other TESD community guys. And god knows who else is lurkin in the shadows! Because they know that this is a place where we LOVE the podcast! And practically everywhere else you can discuss TESD online is full of completely negative termites wanting their government cheese bitching about everything fighting with people who dont share the same opinion as them.User who have been banned have broke the rules on multiple occasions. Insults directed at the TESD crew and directed at users of this subreddit is not tolerated. Intruding on the personal lives of TESD crew and surrounding close ones who frequent this subreddit by the way isnt tolerated ever. Im sure most of you can agree that is fair. It isnt a dictatorship but when the moderators are contacted by CERTAIN PEOPLE cough cough I want this subreddit to be on their side and not against them that practically all the other communities and twitter followers are.From day one of rtesdcares its the ONLY place for REAL fans! who CARE about TESD.

6942874,0,t3_4asmf5,I met both Walt and Ming along with Kev and Jay and a few others during the last Vulgarthon in Red Bank back when Clerks  was about to release right after I graduated high school. I had to show up at the Stash to get my packet with my wristband and other goodies and when I arrive I see Walt behind the counter. He nods and I nod back and proceed to walk around the store and bask in the View Askewness of everything. Eventually I grab a shirt and walk up to the counter to pay and tell Walt I need to pick up my packet. He obliges and starts getting everything ready for me and as he does that I try and make small talk. The first thing that popped in my head was to ask So hows Brodie doing? He looked up and said in a very Walt way Oh shes not with us.I immediately panic and say Oh wow Im sorry... and Walt says Well I mean shes not with us at the house shes just at my moms right now.I laugh and say how relieved I am and we finish and say our goodbyes.........And did I mention that I also met Ming?When I got back to my hotel I looked through everything I was supposed to get and I noticed that the most important thing the wristband essentially my ticket to get in was missing. I call the Stash and Walt answers I tell him whats up and he says theyve gotten a couple calls about that. ...and guess whose job it was to put the packets together? Ming.Walt tells me that Ming will be there in the morning so stop by and hell give me my wristband. The next morning I show up and as I walk in Ming walks right up to me and saysHey hows it going? with a giant grin on his face as only Ming would have.I tell him why Im there and he says Oh ok ok and then grabs my wristband and apologizes for the mistake. I told him it was no big deal and he shook my hand as I left.It wasnt until a few years later when TESD started and I began listening that I realized how genuine my experience with both Walt and Ming were. ,tesdcares,d13ayv8,9,t5_2ubha

10677273,0,t3_5srck4,When Chan go in they go in hard and they go in dry.All true tbh. Bry is a huge hypocrite and a classic bully  mean angry cruel threats of violence...but only ever at people he sees as weaker than him.Despite this I still like him. Or at least like listening to him. But I cant disagree with any of it.Edit  surprised they forgot his Twitter and TESD appeals for Ants to dox and harrass people on his behalf,tesdcares,ddha3fj,13,t5_2ubha
10677843,0,t1_ddhbuiv,Whats the point of posting literally anything?Its a lot more interesting than What episode did X say X...Thread .And since Bry is very uh....forthright with his opinions on people and actively hates people who get easily offended Im sure he wouldnt be the sort of pusshole who would be at all bothered by it....right?,tesdcares,ddhc7fl,9,t5_2ubha

10708348,0,t3_5t6cdv,I like him and pretty much always have. The website stuff was a little weird with him agreeing and backing out but other than that always cool to me.I like him now more than ever really. He brings out a side of Walt that no one else can. The type of chemistry he and Walt have is something different than with Bryan and Q. He indulges walt in all of his weird thoughts beliefs if you can call them that and recently he helped create dyslexia which is honestly one of my favorite segments of recent history. Sunday Jeff is the only person that gets Walt  as giddy as Git em.  ,tesdcares,ddkhi5n,10,t5_2ubha
