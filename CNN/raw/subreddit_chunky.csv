488640,0,t3_1zpt79,All of these have sunlight color set to a light orange for a more natural lighting color. When using fog or atmosphere turning up the sunlight intensity will increase the visibility of fogatmosphere. You can use this to create the effect as seen in the th picture where it looks like mist is rising off of the water. This will also increase the saturation of whatever sunlight color you have so the orange that I picked shows through fairly well and creates a nice sunsetsunrise effect.For shots  hours after sunrise I prefer to use a light pink color as seen in this image. Note the slight pinkish hue of the stone in the mountains as well as the same mist effect.I find that using clearstill water works best for the mist effect.A few other shots in the album feature especially long focal lengths which makes things appear closer together. This gives a nice looming effect when you have mountains or other tall objects in the background of smaller objects. You can take further advantage of this effect by using a strong narrow depth of field effect as seen in the first image. This effect creates a fairly convincing tiltshift style image which I think looks really cool with Minecraft.,chunky,cfvt8ln,7,t5_2u7cf

870609,0,t3_243lvc,This is just a pretty lame house that I built with some friends. I was looking for something to render and I started this originally at x. It was too small so I rerendered at x but its taking forever for anything to change at all. I have a pretty wimpy computer would someone with a powerful computer be willing to finish this until its perfect?image,chunky,ch38qto,1,t5_2u7cf

8960073,0,t1_d7oeyg1,render in k resample down to  tadaa doubled your effective SPP.  Im certain youve probably done something much more advanced to this since the net SPPvsCPU time gain is negligible. A guide on ways to get more SPP on less CPU time would be very much appreciated.  I seem to remember someone did a scene blend one with emitters and one without and managed to make it look great but I cant remember it atm.,chunky,d7ov78k,1,t5_2u7cf
