2441033,0,t3_2ng8x1,I would like to introduce my fictional modified version of Los Angeles. It will be based a bit on my fantasy Los Angeles Metro map which depicts wayyy more rapid transit lines than are actually there today. Also there will be a bullet train link to San Francisco which hasnt even broke ground in the real world. Here are my reasons for the changes. More lines means more infrastructure and denser development hence more possibilities to stage fights. I want to have Miles Lightning Tiger use public transit as a way of showing him wanting to be like a normal person in a cosmopolitan atmosphere.. The bullet train will be used to show how fast SolarGirl is.. This could potentially set up my villain It could imply that rail transit wasnt as pushed back against by the oil industry until he comes along.Other changes My SoCal region will be home to some biotech companies and biorelated government contractors. This will set up some villainsSuperheroes starting three leaving room for more MagiKat SolarGirl and Lightning Tiger. LT is the only one who uses a secret identityImportant supporting characters Rakim Carter a minimum wager and drug dealer with technopathic abilities. He ends up helping Lightning Tiger track down crime especially syndicate activity James Bradford a mysterious British man who advertises himself as the guy to contact when something supernatural goes down. Ally of MagiKatVillains various supernatural threats demons evil sorcerers vampires etc. experimental accidents presence of crime syndicates with a small number of magically and superpowered allies.,Collabcomics,cmdf0i8,3,t5_32mn1
