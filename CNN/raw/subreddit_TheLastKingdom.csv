5512426,0,t1_cweztiv,Yes you are vindicated by the show in regards to the pommel although to be fair to the Videos maker he was only working on a publicity poster. In my opinion they should have embraced Cornwells enjoyment of historical accuracy and satisfied many a history students desire to see a proper sword of the time. I think this idea of a two handed sword as cool is a bit out dated and these days people wouldnt be so impressed. Weve seen it before and no one is going to raise their eyebrows and say really? a warrior with a one handed sword?I also agree with the point about rectangular shields. Doesnt hurt and maybe there was a hangover from RomanoBritish culture that had this traditon  Cornwell did like that trope when writing the Arthur Trilogy. But there is a lot of evidence that they were in fact round and for people like me who dont want another historically nonsensical drama like Vikings its a bit of a disappointment that they decided to make it simple for the viewer in such ways.,TheLastKingdom,cwg9gik,1,t5_32i4z
5541253,0,t1_cwjunlz,The question is how they have been depicted.  The English havent been shown as delighting in the viciousness the Vikings have.  Whats the worst the English have so far been shown?  They dislike Danes well they have pretty damn good reason to.  One of the three kings in Northumbria does something damn stupid in battle.  One of the others is fairly callous when he loses his son in the beginning of the show.  One guy tries to murder his nephew.  Thats about it.  With the exception of the last all of those pale in comparison to the shit the Danes have been doing.  ,TheLastKingdom,cwjxzcr,1,t5_32i4z

9452256,0,t3_56ootg,I started the series this year around June and by August I was up to date with everything. At this moment Im reading the new book and I love all these stories. Thing is they have to finish at one point you guys know if Cornwell has put a limit of how many more Saxon stories he will write? ,TheLastKingdom,d9e5241,1,t5_32i4z

11217389,0,t1_df3gzy5,I didnt say it was more historically accurate I said the costume choices in TLK were noticeably bad. The ones in Vikings at least didnt stare you in the face black leather armour aside...,TheLastKingdom,df3h72w,3,t5_32i4z
11298194,0,t3_610t7r,Awesome episode. I like how the story is moving. Ill need to try the books this summer. ,TheLastKingdom,dfcmt4m,2,t5_32i4z
11329519,0,t3_602unp,I think Vikings is better. The first season was a little shaky but they had less money and it showed. I think TLK has a little more money to start with and the story from the books is really great. So far I dont think its lived up to the books and sometimes I get a cheesy Xena vibe from the show. But yes if you like TLK youll like Vikings.Also consider Barbarians mini series on the History Channel. Its really good but more of a documentary.,TheLastKingdom,dfg6kew,1,t5_32i4z
