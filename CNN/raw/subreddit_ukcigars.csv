2125797,0,t1_cl9zslh,I guess the impact on second hand smoke still rings true though to what extent I couldnt say  which will be their argument. If only they would allow venues that have the express permission to allow smoking. so that if you choose to work there you understand that it will be full of people smoking and if you elect to visit there you understand that it will be full of people smoking. But then that enables smoking which isnt what they want. If they ban smoking in public parks etc then they should seriously look at a ban on Holister where i have to choke half to death just to walk past it with the hideous perfume pouring out the front of the shop.,ukcigars,cla19yh,1,t5_33cs8
2302622,0,t3_2lmocw,its great. I think unless youre doing it youll miss out on flavours aroma and nicotine. frequency will vary based on the strength and flavour of the smoke.,ukcigars,clwbk5s,4,t5_33cs8
2342433,0,t1_cm0uqre,Im wondering if its an origin coffee or an arabica blend. Ill have to snoop around. Really good coffee shops treat coffee like wine sourcing beans being involved in the roasting process. Hmm ill pull up an example of a good coffee shop. The cafe and the roaster nextdoor Theres a lot of individuals within the arabica family tree. Knowing the blend probably a guarded secret would help to point you to a new coffee blend.can you describe its flavours strengthetc? ,ukcigars,cm18jfk,1,t5_33cs8
