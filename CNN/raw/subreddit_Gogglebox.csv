Dont see them following some script.But I dunno I listen to a lot of Sirius XM satellite radio comedy shows which are basically like Radio  but interesting conversations and they have writers even though  of what the host says is their own thought a writer every  minutes will feed them a line and they work it into their monologue and you cant notice it. Maybe theres something like that.I doubt it though!,Gogglebox,cniam8r,0,t5_35rrf
