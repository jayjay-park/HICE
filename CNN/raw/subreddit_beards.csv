483671,0,t3_1zmo3z,Run your fingers or comb through your beard. Just as you reach the end of your hair stop. Use a set of scissors not electric clippers and cut all your hair to equal length. Normally I only trim my sides down but you should cut and loose stray hair off of your chin as well. When I trim mine I maybe take off around   inch of just the longer hair. Dont cut the shorter ones.  Just even your beard hair and it will dramatically help at taking the ragged scraggy look away. ,beards,cfv8w5h,1,t5_2qn08

541539,0,t3_20c3mt,Not everyone has facial hair patterns to create a full beard. For example my cheeks are patchy but my chin and lip are full. Grow what you have and use a trimmer to keep it short and neat until the smaller hairs have time to catch up in order to keep your facial hair looking full. This should keep you from looking like a homeless person. A beard like a man should look like it has purpose. That being said I have encountered many a homeless man with a fine beard. ...Its the homeless womens beards that gross me out. ,beards,cg1tvcm,4,t5_2qn08
550631,0,t1_cg2ukzp,Not a problem buddy. Before you make any purchases I would read up on products for a while. I watched a lot of videos on youtube about beard product reviews and just general care and information. I started with watching Beardbrand videos which I think is a good place to start. Heres a link Im not sure about what he says about the multivitamins diet and weightlifting as I dont think that helps your beard grow a great deal or at least my beard anyway.There are also the Bearding Guides on the toolbar to the right which have a few good threads for working on the beard. One last tip that I forgot earlier Almost never wash your beard with shampoo or soap. If you get really dirty or sweaty then you should wash it obviously but your beard will be a lot more healthy and moisturized if you do not wash it and apply an oil nearly every day.One other thing Ive noticed is that beard oil weighs down the beard a bit which helps it grow downward I believe. Or maybe its just my imagination. If someone else knows something then they should comment. Hahah.,beards,cg2v2vw,1,t5_2qn08

Of course they often include other oils jojoba tee etc but grapeseed is usually the base I think.My own recipe is just a mix of grapeseed oil and rose water because I like the smell. Maybe  oil  rose water. I put some vanilla in it but it was kind of pointless.I store it in a tiny mason jar I had lying around and use a medicine dropper I bought from the store.

Growing up Ive always wanted one but while all my friends were able to grow mustaches and signs of a strong beard happening I was stuck with thin chin hairs and catfish whiskers for a stache.  I even got nicknamed Catfish because of it.  Then later on I noticed I was able to grow full under the chin but that wasnt anything to be happy about.So all I ever did was shave and shave.  Then I decided to leave it for a month for NoShaveNovember and I noticed I was growing in areas I never did before.  A few months later Im somewhat actually growing a full stache although it was still lightly colored.  I still grow full under the chin but Im growing about an inch above the jawline with signs of cheek growth.  So Im super hyped that Im able to grow and Im pretty hopefully that by the time I hit  I could have a respectable beard.  ,beards,cjd8l42,5,t5_2qn08

Find a good barber that specializes in beards.  Let him know your dilemma and see what he can do.. Trim it back down to the shorter beard and start over.  I hate even saying this as you have an enviable beardmustache right now.  But sometimes life throws us a curve ball and you strike out.

That November Id mostly do things like text him while I was at work and ask him to please make sure that weird beardless dude left before I got home. And I didnt kiss him until he let it start to grow back but that was less to do with punishment and more because it seriously creeped me out to kiss him without it. I envy your mother and I wish that I could say the same when weve been together that long. I only made it  years without seeing naked face.

2389964,0,t3_2mq7e0,First of all I think thats a great beard. Secondly I have a very similar issue with my growth pattern so heres my recommendation for optimizingUsing scissors trim the edge of your beard on your right side right pic so that it is near symmetrical with your left. You want the edge line going almost straight down from your sideburns vertically.  Your beard shape will now be very symmetrical which is pleasing to the eye and aids in fullness. Then just keep growing and like the other posters have recommended you can use a brush if you feel like you need it.Personally I havent found the need for a brush once Ive provided a little initial shaping. Good luck.,beards,cm73umi,1,t5_2qn08

Props on realizing what works well for you.Heres a picture thats on the top of all time posts in this subAlso I recently tried growing my beard out for a month and didnt like it so I have it kind of short now too. Longer than yours though by a little bit.Tips for you I would say to find a way to stylize your facial hair a bit. Maybe grow the mustache longer than the rest? Or grow the chin area more but keeps the sides the same just enough to give shape not blatant?Just find a way to make it personalized is what I am trying to get at. Btw out of the three pics I think you look the best in the stubble pic. Your chin looks stronger. The facial hair softens you a bit for some reason.Your hair looks best imo in the clean shaven pic too. Your hair is good you should grow it out. just my two cents,beards,cnaxq74,1,t5_2qn08

But that requires infrastructure to raise the cow knowledge veterinary services the space and equipment to slaughter and butcher the animal. Youre paying the farmer and the butcher for things the ordinary person cant do.  I have no special skills and managed to make a years worth of beard oil for a cost of about  and  minutes of research and effort.

2855580,0,t1_cnsm2ap,I only shampoo and condition it once a week the rest of the week I just rinse and towel dry or cold wash on mornings when I dont have time for a shower. I use beard oil everyday sometimes balm if I have a few strays  especially after a shower and before going out.  Just a few drops is fine. Ive trimmed it twice since Ive been growing but nothing drastic dont use clippers unless you wanna tame the sides down a little but go easy and start off with a long guard and fade up to blend with your hair. I just use a good pair of scissors and snip away any longer hairs or split ends. I used to trim a line over my top lip to stop it going in my mouth but now I just leave it and stick some balm in there and keep pushing to the sides. Only time I use a clippers is to tidy up the neckline and a few hairs off the cheeks but keep it natural. Anything else you need to know Im happy to help. There are lots of good videos on YouTube from the beardbrand or the beard baron that have helped me along the way. Best thing Ive learned is be patient and if you feel like youve had enough of your patchy itchy beard just give it a week. Youd be surprised how much difference a week makes .

My work regularly requires me to deliver presentations and reports to partners and stakeholders and to say I have struggled with the unevenness of how my facial hair has come in would be an understatement!

3249467,0,t3_2x8kq0,A little bit of a trim biannually will help it grow in faster in the future. works basically the same as head hair. As the ends take on damage and break off it lessens the length you will see out of growth. If you want some real length out of it even just a cm trim every six months will honestly really help.As for the shape it looks like you already have some great ideas to even it out. As long as you keep the neck line trimmed in an straight it will always improve the tidiness in appearance. Working with your feature will always give your facial hair the look of distinction. You have a great beard! Keep up the good work!,beards,coytdft,1,t5_2qn08

3334387,0,t3_2ychmc,I had a quick look around and I wasnt able to find what I think youre looking for. If youre wanting to keep it short but youre not sure exactly what length then heres what I suggestI. Grow your beard up to the length you wish to keep it and then grow it a little longer.II. Grab your clippers and attach the highest guard length that you have. Use it to trim your beard.III. If its still longer than youd like it then use the next size down. Keep doing that until youve found your preferred length and guard.IV. Optional Realise that its too much of a hassle shaving and trimming so often. Simply let your beard grow.,beards,cp8cgv6,1,t5_2qn08

5393415,0,t3_3owdoh,dont use any of that commercial soap it will dry your beard out and your skin. remember the skin on your face is a lot more sensitive generally than your scalp. Try to find an all natural soap I use Dr. Bronners google it. Its less likely to dry your beard and skin out. After the shower I pat dry then use beard oil. Id say just find an oil that you like some people are picky about the ingredients though. I use honest amish since I like the smell. I do this daily but many people here say its best to do it only a few times a week. My beard gets very bristly if I dont do it every day though.,beards,cw12hoy,1,t5_2qn08

I do have to trim the ends once they get to a certain length because they tend to want to curl down instead of up.I would try to continue to grow it past the  point and work on manipulating the hairs with your fingers to grow in the direction you want.  That might sound easier than done but it works for me.  If Im sitting on the coach at home or at the office...or wherever....Ill use my fingers and manipulate the hair.

6433920,0,t3_43tath,Try a hot towel  beard oil treatment. After you wash your beard and face apply a light helping of oil be sure to get it right down to the skin then wrap a hot wet towel to your face and let it sit for a bit repeat a second and a third time. The towel needs to be as hot as you can stand without scalding yourself.After youve done the hot towel bit all your pores should be fairly open and its now a great time to apply about a thumbnails worth of beard balm  rub it into your palms until it melts then apply it to your beard and brush it through well. Hand shape to set and youre done. If your beard is particularly dry you will want to reapply your beard oil two or three times a day more if its a larger beard. Each time soak your beard and pat dry and apply your oil. Regular daily applications will eventually soften it right up again. Reduce or eliminate any shampooing of your beard down to once a week. Use only sulfate free products. If after a week or two of increased use and application of your beard oils and balms isnt having any effect on your brillo pad beard then its time to switch up your product line with something else. It may take you a while to find the ones thatll work best with your personal physiology. Dont be afraid to try new product. And please remember to perform a patch test each time you introduce new product into your regimen. ,beards,czkt04c,1,t5_2qn08

8014754,0,t1_d4gu6mi,I thought your cheeks looked natural but if you are saying you edged those then I commend your skill and good judgment !In terms of the fullerbuttidy facial hair dilemma something to bear in mind is that beards usually look tidyish at their shortest as sort of stubble bears and again once they have been grown out much longer because the hair lays down for you.In between they generally look pretty raggedy ass with hairs sticking out and the like.If you constantly trim you are probably never giving yourself the chance to find out that sometimes fuller is in fact tidier. The hairs lay down for you to a much greater extent. They can be brushed where the grain is against the style you want.This will also help with your thickness. No one has uniform thickness everywhere. A bit of length helps a lot. You need to bite the bullet and grow without trimming for at least  months to experience this.,beards,d4gxllx,2,t5_2qn08

If the male family members on either side of your family are hairless theres a fair chance youll be hairless as well.  Youre also young.  The older you get the fuller your beard gets.  Case in point I have a full beard now but had no moustache connectors  years ago.  Stay away from anything that promises facial hair growth.  Those are akin to products promising to enlarge ones penis.  There are things that may help stimulate beard growth such as eating healthy getting a good nights sleep working out etc but theres no magical pill that you can take that guarantees you a beard.

8491681,0,t1_d61sz8c,Usually its the customers or clients that decide a part of your appearance is unprofessional and your employer is merely enforcing societal standards and expectations. A beard typically is considered part of your style more than part of your body as you can change it like you can change your hair. You dont see bankers walking around with mohawks like theyre still in high school. Nobody would want someone to handle their money if they cant even be bothered to look the part of a banker. So yes it can hinder their performance in the workplace. You might think what comes out of your mouth is the only thing thats important but so is building a rapport with the customer. If they dont like a purely personal stylistic aspect about you they have every right to feel that way and they may take their business elsewhere because they dont think youre a serious about your job as you should be. There goes a perfectly good customer because you felt it was more important to express yourself than it was to do your job.A legitimate doctor will not give you a bullshit note saying you cant shave when you clearly can. And even a doctor willing to smudge it a bit cant endorse a full grown beard like the one OP posted. Clippers with a halfinch guard dont irritate the skin. And hell even that is probably an improvement in the case of the person who this rule is targeting.You can express yourself while also keeping your appearance appropriate for your profession. If society dictates that a patchy ugly beard is not in keeping with the standards they have for your job you can either shave it or find a job where your interaction is low enough that nobody has to see your shitty beard. If you have a good looking beard and society dictates any sort of facial hair is not in keeping with the standards they have for someone in your position you can either shave it or find a job where it is appropriate. If you have a good looking beard and your employer bans facial hair because the people with patchy beards hurt business more than your beard helps it you can either grow up and realize that shaving your beard is in the best interest of the company or you can go find a job without such a rule.,beards,d630bmg,1,t5_2qn08

My buddy applied it to his head for regular male pattern baldness and it grew a visible fuzz on his ears long before anything grew on his head.  No joke.  . Minoxidil takes months of daily application to start working and will dry your face out really badly.  . Youre only .  You may not have a full beard until youre .  Its way too early to start thinking about chemical assistance.  . If youve never grown your facial hair out fully you may be surprised at what grows in.  It may look patchy but with a months growth a lot of the patches can fill in either from slow growing hair or by being covered.

Are you a senior in high school or graduated and furthering your education andor working? You said this was your first time you were able to grow it out.,beards,dcgavkl,2,t5_2qn08

10755896,0,t1_ddpd03v,Ahh see where this has gone.   You have realized you can not reproduce your claims and brought God into the equation.  Notice how I never mentioned God.  I dont need to.  Who or what the creator is does not have relevance in a conversation on the merits of Darwins claims.    Aliens or simulation theory would both fit into all the evidence of creation I have provided.  If I find a watch on the sidewalk I dont have to personally see or know its creator to know they exist.   The patterns of creation make it extremely clear that the item in question was designed by a designer.  Also do you notice the Irony in your statement?    I cant put God on a table and measure him just as I can not do the same with a supernova.    But I can examine the effects and determine the cause....  just like we do with supernovas.    ,beards,ddpe1lh,1,t5_2qn08

11782929,0,t3_681p6s,At the length youre at use scissors and not a trimmer. Comb your dry hair the opposite direction of growth and even it out. Make several small passes so as not to trim too short. There are some good YouTube videos out there. Check out the Beardbrand ubandholz channel. Clean up the neckline with a trimmer.,beards,dgvmsyq,3,t5_2qn08
