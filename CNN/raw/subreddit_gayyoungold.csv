823491,0,t3_1ws4g6,Hey Im from the opposite end and I was the one supporting the two of us.  The parts I had most needed but didnt feel I got was the help with taxes or not understanding food that doesnt go I to the microwave.  But the part that gets me is that I have maybe still feel like Im leading the relationship as both me and the therapist if you know what I mean.  Im honestly at the same page Im lowering my expectations but its harder to find a second opinion thats not so judgey so pm me if you want to talk about this kind of thing. ,gayyoungold,cgxvso9,1,t5_2skpz
886147,0,t3_249mmf,Great story I can feel the excitement in your words! However..gt Should I just leave things as they are and just count him as a lovely friend that comes to meet me every so often? I feel like there is so much between us but realistically pursuing a relationship is just not possible. Other guys just dont compare  hes an allAmerican hunky silverdaddy. I cant get and dont want to get over him.I think youve answered your own question here. You seem to be developing feelings for him despite the fact that he is married and living in the States. I hope this doesnt come off as judgemental but I hope it helps you see things from a different perspective  Are you happy to remain on the side while he is still married? Do you know what you want in this relationship? How sustainable is the fact that he travels back and forth to see you?I understand that this must be a very exciting part of your life where its much easier for you to meet men but in my honest opinion from the sounds of it I think this is only going to break your heart in the future if you continue to pursue it. With that said if all you are looking for is a bit of fun and not a lifepartner then I think youll enjoy yourself.I personally disagree with the fact that hes cheating on his wife unless of course she is aware of this and I wonder if you can live with this as well? Feel free to disagree I know not everyone feels the same way. At the end of the day this is just my opinion ,gayyoungold,ch50awa,5,t5_2skpz

2442666,0,t3_2nhfxp,No I havent been in the same situation. You moved too fast.  years and you were already financially dependent on him? Thats not what a relationship is. Especially when you are only a freshman in college. He is just as much to blame trying to share everything with you to help keep you with him. My advice get out finish school. If you want to be with him fine set yourself some limits. Dont depend on him financially get a job and support yourself. Especially when you have an addiction. How is it fair to this guy that your blowing all your money on your addiction then he is supplementing the rest for you? Grow up if you want to be in a relationship and have it be respectful to both parties you need to be more mature. As for the family if they dont want you in their lives you dont need to be. It sucks its something we all struggle with. It took me  years to feel comfortable telling my mom about it when i was sure i wouldnt need to depend on her. Its sucky to think about but there are merits to staying in the dark about certain topics. Best option is to just get over your addiction go to therapy for your depression its the only way. Most universities will offer assistance in that department whether it be free or reduced. Talk to somebody. And then try to reestablish contact with your family if they still dont want to listen to you then you dont need them. But you need to be in a clear mindbody to have a good conversation with them. ,gayyoungold,cmdm9pb,-1,t5_2skpz

2790809,0,t3_2s0v5u,I only have a couple years experience with getting fucked but heres my thoughtsTry to have him play with your ass with his tongue if hes comfortable with that and then fingers with lube.  Start with  finger have that eventually go all the way then and then try two fingers.  If his finger nails cause you sharp pains tell him.  If it feels like his fingers feel really hot like a burning sensation tell him you need more lube.  Youll probably clench down on his fingers for a while but just remember to focus on breathing and your ass will relax.  When you feel ready to take his cock lots of lube and just take it slow.  Remember to breathe out.  Breathing can take your mind off the initial shock and again for when hes all the way in you.  Im thinking if you transition from fingers    fingers to a  inch cock theres going to be pain.  If there isnt some initial pain since youre a virgin then damn well done!Oh and in regards to being clean some will say a healthy digestive system and a shower is all you need but if you want to be sure you could look into cleaning your ass out with an enema bulb.  If you have questions about cleaning feel free to ask.Have fun and play safe!,gayyoungold,cnlazjt,2,t5_2skpz
2866619,0,t1_cntjn3h,I dont believe that he is cheating on me he often told me that he never loved someone more then me and I really trust him in this.The Emails that I saw at our first  months of the relationship made me cry a lot and I did not understand why he blamed me for seeing them.But after that he told me that he deleted everyone and that he is not writing anymore. I dont want to look in his emails because I dont want to and I do trust him. He is the love of my life.But at one point he really does not understand my anxieties and just says he does not want to be controlled.I guess I will learn how to deal with it when he meets his exs.

It would be a good chance to strike up a conversation about fishing I could ask if he fishes if he does I could express my desire to pick up the hobby and could innocently ask if he knows of any good fishing areas and if hed like to go with me sometime.

Your best protections are the ones you can implement on your own.If someone is undetectable they cant pass the virus. Full stop. Thats just the consensus of years of studies.  If medication is stopped viral levels rise. A person then becomes infectious. My original statement stands viral suppression of HIV renders it untransmissible. Link belowFor HIV negative people daily dosing with Truvada for PrEP provides the best protection against HIV we currently have near  reduction in transmission. Even managing to take four or more doses a week still provides a high degree of protection against HIV.  None of which discounts condoms. When used condoms are highly protective against HIV. They also provide varying amounts of protection against other STIs as well.A person concerned about their sexual health doesnt have to rely on another person of unknown status to keep them safe.

10235317,0,t3_5mjcy7,Something to remember is that you can still love someone and move on from them to find someone new. I learned this from having to break up with my ex due to long distance... I still love him but I accept that I will never see him again. And that we can both find happiness in other relationships,gayyoungold,dc48azu,2,t5_2skpz
10340472,0,t3_5nw152,Hey it is totally Ok for you to be sexually attracted to older men dont feel the need to rush and label yourself this or that just have safe fun exploring your desires. Personally I wouldnt be doing bareback especially at this stage when you dont know him much.  As far as your bolt its normal to feel a post orgasm deflate May be try to focus on pleasuring each other first  after you cum just lay back and enjoy the moment.  U got nothing to be afraid or ashamed of. There are plenty of older guys out there for you! Good luck.,gayyoungold,dcg5gm2,1,t5_2skpz

10654072,0,t3_5sfz37,I dont fully understand whether you have met in person or not.  But of course thats step one.  If in the flesh theres real physical and emotional attraction I dont see why there would be a problem  for him particularly  as youre both youngish adults. To talk of a relationship at this stage of the game might be moving a bit quickly  get comfortable with each other and see how it flows.,gayyoungold,ddevw3k,1,t5_2skpz

11265799,0,t3_60qps7,First as an early s there is nothing wrong with your sex drive or that its too high as was suggested to you!  Its true that as a man in his early s his sex drive can be reduced and take longer to reload but that doesnt mean cut off all intimacy with you even if hes not boned to the max there are many ways to have intimacy with you kiss cuddles etc and give u a happy ending!  There can also be medical reasons for his lack of sex drive and he should consider seeing a doctor to eliminate any physiological causes.  A relationship such as you describe does need effort and commitment from both parties if your BF cant or wont put in then you maybe should think about if it is  time to move on.  You sound like an engaging young man and I am sure there are many older men just waiting to meet you and enjoy your company socially and sexually.  All the best .,gayyoungold,df8yn1d,3,t5_2skpz

First he was addicted to alcohol amp drugs now hes addicted to hardcore extreme sports. Hes just going from one extreme to the other and doesnt seem able to find a happy medium.  ,gayyoungold,dfg6ujq,2,t5_2skpz
11555305,0,t1_dg5f29m,Attitude. You came to that conclusion because I said too old let me clarify that for you. When I say too old I mean . Im successful want to live a happy life travel and explore. Can not do that with someone that old without constantly taking care of them. I have been with older men my attitude has nothing to do with it. It always comes down to my nationality and skin color. Look at the world now since Trump has been president thats all I have to say. There are some guys out there but theyre usually taken and already in a relationship. Guess I just have to wait it out and see.,gayyoungold,dg5sq73,3,t5_2skpz
