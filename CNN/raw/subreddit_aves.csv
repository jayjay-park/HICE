7886,0,t3_1u73mf,I think trap actually might tame down a little.  I still say look at a few years ago the majority of the world hated dubstep because there was SO much of it around that was terrible.  The good stuff however was phenomenal.  Thats how I see trap right now so well see if it becomes like dubstep is today within the next few years.  Also heres hoping I blow up lol.  FihBeeOG man I hear that guys gonna be the shit.  ,aves,cefc1f0,2,t5_2rev7

18864,0,t3_1u73mf,I hope the bubble bursts so all the people making the terrible cheese electro bangers will jump ship. DJs will hopefully be in less demand and not be overbooked all the time so we can start getting more quality festival lineups with longer sets.I dont predict that the bubble will burst this year but it is coming very soon as evidenced by most of the people that were into EDM even  years ago leaving the major festivals for smaller clubunderground shows with higher quality talent. I think in the really mainstream stuff were going to see things split into two categories. The traphiphop influenced shows with a lot of younger people esp. the bro crowd and more ravey type stuff with deep house trance prog house and all the hard dance music stuff with the more PLUR crowd. The only place youre going to see the two together are at the major festivals like EDC and ULTRA. Either way things cant keep going like they are. Everyones riding a wave of popularity right now and so few acts are really keeping the quality of their setsproductions to a high standard. When the people that are bashing a gram of molly at festivals burn out and get bored the whole thing is going to crash. Its a cycle for sure. This most recent explosion will calm down then the most accessible acts of the underground will get popular and so on.,aves,cegkx3i,2,t5_2rev7

223617,0,t1_cf3qfv2,I dont think you know what you are talking about. Very rarely does any DJProducer strictly play his own songs during a DJ set. Also all of the real DJs you describe every single one of them was once a local hack playing at something smaller. Do you remember what got you into EDM? Regardless of circumstance the catalyst was you giving something new a try. How do you expect new artists to emerge if everyone only listens to Tiesto Bassnectar Andy C Kaskade and another hand full of artists? You have to remember the scene that you have today started in the underground by people giving something different a chance. Shut out the underground and you might as well replace Keisha with Krewella Drake with Deadmau and Justin Bieber with Avicii... because thats what the scene will become Pop. Then how will new artists break through? Only by the help of major record labels and corporate branding. That will be the nail on the PLUR coffin.,aves,cf3wyd0,7,t5_2rev7

Not to knock EDC but I dont understand all this hate for Ultra... its overpriced as fuck this year and Im not attending but the past few years there Ive heard some incredible music and had great experiences.gtnot going from stage to stage on a strict schedule waiting for the big names.So you dont go from stage to stage at EDC?  And TBH what is the issue here?  There are great acts to see on all the stages of course you figure out a schedule of who you want to see.  Friday alone this year has Diplo Zedd The Glitch Mob Kaskade MGMT Eric Prdyz just on the two main stages.gtThe LED screens and focus on HEADLINERSHow does EDC differ here?  They have a ridiculously massive main stage far more elaborate than Ultras where Calvin Harris and Above and Beyond play the same sets the played at Ultra months earlier.

If plastikman is performance then what is decks fx and ? I do get what youre saying though and I think a lot of times the costumes lighting decorations and dancers are covering up for what is musically anyway a boring setperformance.  My answer is whichever one is the most conducive to dancing which usually means a dj in a comfortable space with cool people. However out of all of the concerts raves shows clubs and everything I have been to in my life Rabbit In The Moon is one of the best shows I have ever seen. They use the performance part of their set as a means of crowd interaction which is just a phenomenal thing to witness. Basically the opposite of a Daft Punk show. I love Daft Punk and I enjoy their pyramid but I feel their performance exists as an excuse to entice people to test the video quality on their new camera phones. which should be illegal and punishable by  hours of sober happy hardcore listening,aves,chejdfj,5,t5_2rev7

Honestly mainstream edm is just the new flavor of pop and theres good and bad. Artists like Calvin Harris Kaskade and Alesso are all coming out with there own unique sounds that are well crafted pieces of pop music. To completely disregard all of edm as trash is similar to people that disregard any genre.

I am also not the OP but its good to see you are still proving evidence that you are the asshole.

Apples and oranges.As a point of interest escape is actually cheaper than dod.As far as the people you meet at these differnet events go myself and the network of people I base this off of is only a drop in the bucket compared to how many people go total bit this is what I believe the ravekandi kidplurr culture is more prevalent at insomniac events not that it isnt found at all at hard events because it is more of a rave than Hard is.

I personally love dubstep and trap so Im usually down with the lineup but if you like hardstyle then HARD events might not be the best match.

Its not that you dont have the exact same thing its that we dont have the incredibly commercial side of the industry constantly trying to eat up as much of the market as they can.

You probably know his big hit song with Steve Angello from  Also youd probably know Turbulence with Aoki and Lil Jon.  When all these progressive house guys started going really big room what I was calling dutch house in  but I guess is now what we think electro house andor big room house is I REALLY wasnt into it.  Just big drops to boring loud bass beats intended for big festivals boring me to death. Then many of them went REALLY poppy as EDM became a thing..listen to Tiesto if you want to understand what I mean.  I cant stand super mainstream vocal house music because its literally the same music as ten years ago and is just boring so basic...at least this show will be booty shakin bass music and not emotional pop vocal bullshit.

5902009,0,t3_3w4iuk,I started raving in my early s. I rolled... Like a ton. That was before we knew much about harm reduction and testing. Now Im in my s with a big boy job kids wife etc. Its OK to take breaks sounds like you just need balance. One thing I advise younger ravers is there will always be another party  andor an excuse to roll. Make them mean something. Try more intimate settings make the people you party with lasting friends. Never let the party affect your job family responsibilities. When the come down and recovery and cost outweigh the positive its time to take a break. Good luck ,aves,cxtacin,45,t5_2rev7

5916639,0,t3_3wct9b,So first and foremost. Drugs are not a necessity. UNLESS and this is the one exception I make for it youre not super into the music or scene in which case I tell people that maybe itll open their mindset to it. Alright continuing. Drugs are of course not a necessity however it might be too tempting if all your friends are popping left and right. Find out if any of them arent and if theres at least one hold each other to making sure youre both having a good time. Gauge a feeling of the people around you youll feed off their energy and viceversa and youll find your groups of friends more than likely interacting and this is a great way to start meeting individuals not within your group. With events I tell my friends to go to a smaller festival or show first i.e. LED events vs. Insomniac touring rave concerts vs massives so they dont get spoiled and expect everything to be toptier quality. I guess for example I started out with an LED USA  single stage twoday event while my girlfriend started out with Nocturnal Wonderland five stages and three days. Shes typically lost in wanting every event to be like nocturnal and kind of looks down on LED events because the lack of stage decoration and the venue. Of course it varies by person but I think its better to be start out smaller for the sake of future events. ,aves,cxv7b8m,2,t5_2rev7
5921518,0,t1_cxvu169,Welcome to the club!  Its an amazing community  of the time.  Out of curiosity what festival are you considering?  Oh and one more piece of advice is do not be afraid to dance.  Some rookies get a little intimidated by the really good dancers especially if theyre sober.  But I always tell people that out of all the shows Ive been to I remember a lot of really good dancers but I dont remember a single bad dancer.  As long as youre having a good time youre a good dancer.  Nobody is watching you and scrutinizing your dancing theyre all doing their own thing.  Im personally probably a terrible dancer but raves are by far the best place to let loose and practice.  Its also not a bad idea to look up some videos on youtube for the genre of music you like to get some ideas for dance moves.  If you like housetechnohardstyletrance look up some tutorials for shuffling cutting shapes and konijnendans.  That way youll know some basic moves and have a foundation to work off of and you can add your own flair from there.  ,aves,cxvuc49,1,t5_2rev7

6220893,0,t1_cywh9uc,Rich is a very subjective concept.  I used to make a lot of money I wrote  books on computer design techniques and was always single. Lost  of my incomeclients in the big economic crash which resulted in the loss of my housecargirlfriend.  I was able to keep afloat as my vacation house was paid off its a prefab home on an indian reservation  not exactly luxurious.  After  years of basically dicking around and learning to survive on peanuts I ended up coming back to the city to work for my sister to help out her company.  Again living off of a shoestring and at one point lived in my car for  months.  Currently I rent a room from a friend in a personal hell she has  cats!! Its been a heck of a ride and it was just dumb luck I happened to pay off a few key items before the crash or I would not have the fun toys still to play with.  I worked plenty hard for the stuff and I wont argue I live a pretty cush life these days  but I assure you I struggle staying solvent and still need to downsize significantly.  I save my pennies like everyone else for lifes luxuries  EDC aint cheap!  Anyway as they say the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.  And they also say show me a hot chick and Ill show you someone sick of her shit!.

6222259,0,t1_cywtm3e,Well then your experiences are the opposite of mineevery person Ive ever known who had a bad experience with drugs was not a festival. Overdosing is usually not a testament to drug quality but to how much a person decided to take. Some festivals DO allow DanceSafe tents and testing kits the ones I have been to do it all dependsand sneaking in a test kit is not any harder than sneaking in drugs. The atmosphere at a festival is much more conducive to testing which Ive always done than at a raveclub. At a festival there are many suppliers in  placeso the customer has more leverage to demand testing before they buy or else they can move onto the next guy. At home you may know  friend of a friend who knows a connect and your options are to either buy from this one dude or go without. Ive always found that festivals are a buyers market everywhere else is a sellers market.Surely there are arguments for both sides but my experiences have been the opposite of yoursand both our experiences are valid. ,aves,cywwja7,1,t5_2rev7

If you look the same in that old pic on your permit then maybe they will let you in if they dont notice the expiration date.I went to this show at Ultrabar over the summer and I didnt have a valid license so I used my old expired permit and the guy at the front door let me in even though the permit was expired. Its hard to say if he cared whether it was expired or not or if he didnt notice the expiration date. But unfortunately they have a card scanner at the doors of Echostage and Soundcheck now so that old permit trick wont work anymore since the permit wont scan cuz its expired. Your only chance is if you do happen to have an old permit if they dont have card scanners at the door and if the guy doesnt notice the expiration date on the permit.Thats all I got man.

Enough beer for your crew and then a  rack on top of that for the last day when the camp has run dry can be used to trade or can be shared with new festival friends Me and my crew go to church have family breakfast on the last day.

7091017,0,t3_4cnsly,I think one big reason Insomniac is skipping EDC PR  Beyond wonderland SF that is not mentioned is to save money. That money saved will go towards the very special EDC LV th anniversary where everything will be bigger better and be more expensive amp pricier than ever.  It will be massive.Pasquale mentioned new festivals in  some with camping.  Possibly EDC New York with  days instead of  AND with camping.  Awhile ago they were articles about them trying to bring EDC to one of the woodstock forest locations but they failed.  And IDTampT  Mysteryland creators of tomorrowland probably had something to do with it their competitiors another big edm company.  They were st to get Mysteryland US at the original woodstock location and maybe payed good money to be exclusive no other festivals allowed.  Just a guess.   I think its time for EDC NY to have a  day camping experience and them retrying Bethel NY again or a new location somewhere out in the New York forests and fields.   My guess and speculation.,aves,d1k4w6k,9,t5_2rev7

7463927,0,t3_4hkta5,Somewhat similar I camped at nocturnal  and have camped at Coachella the last couple years. Insomniac does a great job with the camping area decorating it keeping it organized etc. Camping spots are setup basically the same way. The main differences I saw were the campgrounds themselves and I believe each site is a little smaller than they are for Coachella. And insomniac definitely values arts and crafts. Plenty of stuff to do during the day from tie dye shirt making to totems to even kandi!  And definitely check out the water park. The slides are alrite but there just is nothing like lounging in a wade pool after raging hard the night before and getting ready for another night of shenanigans!,aves,d2qlp07,2,t5_2rev7

8187755,0,t3_4r9xgx,year veteran. Ive never done single day I think theyre  or less. Ive rented cabins the past three years and it usually works out to personnight with  people in a  person house. Shuttle passes are around  and usually run from Stateline to the venue. In the past they ran from the Montbleu Casino but last year they ran from the Tahoe Transit Center near Heavenly Village. They do have some parking nearby but I think Uber and Lyft now operate in Tahoe.The first three years the crowd was great but we definitely noticed a shift starting the th year. Its been noticeably more crowded with a lot of people shoving and being more inconsideratefucked up. Usually if you stick to the back youre fine but it can get really crowded and rowdy at the tent stage entrances when artists are switching.

Festivals are typically more spread apart through the year but I might see an electronic artist a few times each month at local venues. Ive been to about  festivals total which is how I answered but  local shows at venues or bars shit maybe like  in the last six months and Ive been going at a similar rate for about six years but only do festivals about twice maybe three times each year unless something big comes up I cant miss.

Danced with him and after that the roll was amazing. The moral of the story is find the right people and the right environment.

10272649,0,t3_5n3q0w,Miami itself is much different than Vegas. The atmosphere in Miami is amazing IMO. Beautiful weather although its rained in the past. Ultra is held at the end of WMC. Every DJArtist are in Miami for WMC and many of them make appearances at Ultra. Ultra used to be pinnacle EDM event EDC has definitely began to give it a run for its money. Ultra is more focused around the music and delivering the up most production value. EDC delivers a whole experience your literally at an Electric Carnival. Both events are great I personally like Ultra myself because Im from SoCal and feel like I see the same people from all the local massives at EDC. Not that its a bad thing but once youve done it a bit your always looking for that next big fest to give you that rush you long for. Ultra is that to me now dont get me wrong there is nothing like walking into EDC and realizing your home but Ultra has always been my favorite. EDM has become very mainstream now that I have given friends reviews of certain festivals that I attended and literally the next year the crowd is SOOOO different it changed the vibes at the event. I experienced that at EDCLV last year. Ultra gets its fair share of people going just because its the thing to do but I feel like its not as mainstream at EDC has become. Then again EDC brings in a much bigger crowdin regards of capacity than Ultra. Hope this helped and Im more than happy to answer any questions u might have.

FireEMT staff? No clue. Website? Not a single blurb about it. Map on website? Wrong info. Security people? No clue. Front deskticket booth? No clue. I had even called a week before and was assured everyone knew and Id be directed properly once there. I ended up having to stand in that ginormous cluster of an entrance two years ago for at least an hour just to get into the venue. Steez offered me by email free tickets to compensate after I complained but guess who never responded after I accepted the offer and followed back up? Yep. Real lame. I offered them constructive criticism add a ADA section on your website like Electric Forest  or really any festival worth going to. Ignored that one too. Not giving them my money this year. Or last. I should also add that I was not alone with this experience I spoke with every person in a wheelchair crutches cane etc. All had an identical experience. Adding to this only one stage had a dedicated handicap viewing area. None of the others had a platform or section roped off. ,aves,dd688cf,2,t5_2rev7

I didnt realize I was missing it for about an hour after we left that area so I knew it would be long gone we checked the lost and found and it wasnt there so I just kind of went back to camp with my girlfriend to drink a few beers and probably call it a night. At some point she had the bright idea to call my phone in case somebody had picked it up and someone answered! This guy gave up his front row spot at Jubilee and walked halfway across the venue to meet us in the middle and give me my phone back.

11643813,0,t3_64java,Saw him during his Shogun stageI remember listening to Datisk way back when he released NukeEm. Even though his Shogun tour is over with it is most certainly worth it considering he will play Nasty. That is worth it for that one song right there!,aves,dgfu8tk,1,t5_2rev7

11668537,0,t1_dgimw7n,Yeah I enjoy them for a few songs. But when its every drop and begins to get too big for a tiny venue lit can get pretty old fast. I tend to go with some smaller people so it always ends with me blocking them from the flailing. Cincinnati attracts TONS of high schoolers and younger kids to these shows and a decent amount show up to just get fucked up and rage they really dont have any respect for anyone around them,aves,dgin7cr,4,t5_2rev7
