859623,0,t3_23y6rb,Its not really a RTS but Crusader Kings is pretty damn accurate as far as games go. Its more of a X specifically considered a grand strategy game pretty sure almost all the games in that genre are from the same company and the same engine lol... but it is a strategy game and it is semireal time as opposed to turn based... by semi I mean you can pause and speed up the game without going into the main menu so you can actually pause it and do some shit without losing time.Be warned though it takes forever to finish a game I havent reached the end date on any games so far but I think I will with this last one... I started out as a Viking conqueror of Britian with just one province under my command took all of Britannia all of Scandanavia and Russia and parts of Hispania Africa France and some random areas outside of Russia.

Ways to play the game differently rush strategy turtle every time you play. Nutbustingly good multiplayer.Starcraft Brood War. Do I need to even comment? Arguably the best expansion of all time easily the most played game on LAN. Still played competitively to this day. ish hour campaign and one of the best multiplayer games ever devised by man. You didnt even need a CD key to play the game.Starcraft   bucks when it came out of course if I recall correctlyabout  hours average ish if you dont count the cutscenes  missions with a sequel bait ending and a shit balanced multiplayer on launch. Starcraft  HotS expansion. ..  FUCKING HOURS WITH CUTSCENES on average playtime. Better multiplayer but nothing of what was promised  new units for zerg  for protoss  for terran. Campaign  missions  if you count the dumbass evolution tutorial missions that cant be skipped even if youve played the missions a million times that you cant even fucking fail in. FUCK. SEQUEL BAIT ENDING AGAIN? FUCK OFF.My point is video games arguably had more content and more playability in the s and early s and thats when developers were LIMITED and barely had any legroom to work with. We should be leaps and bounds ahead and yet people would still much rather play Brood War over Starcraft HotS. I love Starcraft  to fucking death its one of my favorite games of all time and I never really played Starcraft  growing up. But god damn I feel fucking bad for Brood War fans.

5130237,0,t3_3l8zw0,gtemphisise on apmJust a heads up if you want to play multiplayer in any RTS game. RTS games are real time games so naturally the faster player who can do more stuff at once will always have an advantage. For RTS recommendations have you taken a look at the Homeworld Remastered Editions? Its a pretty slow paced game although tactics are a bit limited to ship micro imo havent dug deeper I admit. I really wish Relic would fix the drops for CoH. Its the only thing holding it back from being a great game.Its the second most popular RTS behind SC so population will not be an issue. The default Commanders are probably among the best so you wont lose much if you dont buy DLCs.If you want scifi Grey Goo is good too slower paced than SC but last I hear not enough people is playing it.That said I think turnbased games should be more up your alley especially if you want to spend time thinking about stuff.,RealTimeStrategy,cv4dwbe,1,t5_2sbgm

5611803,0,t3_3ryfxt,I just dont like the damage model feels like it is copying the newer Command amp Conquers too much in being arcade like where you can heal faster than damage or bombers do zero damage to certain units because they are not meant to counter them in a rockpaperscissors way and stuff like that. I appreciate the large tech trees and building choice doesnt feel dumbed down in that respect. The Act of War series which Act Of Aggression is based on is more fun IMO and has a way better campaign with cheesy live action FMVs.

5897070,0,t1_cxrqfxp,This is a common misconception thanks to how Starcraft  casters cast the game. The most important aspect of SC and SC is macro resource gathering base building and unit production. Macro gt all. It doesnt matter how good you micro if you dont have the macro to maintain  production.The reason why casters hype up micro during tournaments is because pros have near  macro which means that their main form of skill differentiation is micro. For most players good macro trumps everything else even in Legacy of the Void and all its micromanageable units.Master League is roughly  of all active players and even there not everyone has  macro. For  of the playerbase just pumping out more units than your opponent will let you win.Back in the day there was a Starcraft progamer who tried to get into Platinum then the secondhighest league compared to now where its the fourthhighest through sheer force of macro. He played Protoss and simply massed units his unit of choice was the stalker. He managed to reach Platinum by just group selecting his units and attackmoving into the enemy because he simply had way way more units than the other guy.I cant find this thread anymore because Blizzard regularly purges old forum threads this was a post back in  done to prove the importance of macro.As for hybrid games the best hybrid RTS game that I play right now is DotA . Pretty much its a v RTSRPG hybrid which takes elements from other genres as well. Your typical game lasts about  minutes. Unbalanced matches end in about  minutes while very very even matches can take about an hour.,RealTimeStrategy,cxsn1nd,1,t5_2sbgm
5927694,0,t1_cxrk1z4,I disagree. I loved the third person mode since I felt I could actually see my empire and the common people and I will never forget this game for its amazing naval battles! I hated how it forced you out after a while unless you kept battling. I wish the scale was larger  one of my favourite ships was the Tesseraconter and I wish I could enter buildings. There even were RPG maps focused on this hero mode but I didnt play much. One of the cons of the whole thing was the inability to jump.As Spartak said though managing an empire as well as fighting is quite difficult. ,RealTimeStrategy,cxwnh9v,2,t5_2sbgm

The fist is where you collect resources build a citybase recruit and train soldiers follow a tech tree etc. This mode does typically take  minutes to play and the skyhigh would only be for those players who enjoy taking their slow time building a nice looking city or whatever. The other mode is more of a straight to battle type and a match could be finished in just a couple minutes.

Landing skill shots or ramming ships feels so good. The persistence of your fleet in MP and the upgrade system for shipsskillscrew adds a lot of depth to the game as well. It really makes it so you care about your ships because if you lose a Line ship its gone for  games while its being repaired and you have to make do without it.

10316589,0,t3_5nlavl,Because theyre catering to low skilled players. But the thing is low skilled will still be low skilled even in simple game and lost all the time while good players will find it boring. Casual players also tend to not stick to game for long anyway.If game designers focus on making game for high league not low then it will be better for everyone. Im ok with innovations as long as macro and micro require skill to play and pace of game is not too slow.I think its the biggest mistake theyre trying to make RTS not for their target audience. Or dont understand that easy RTS are just not fun.Interesting thing nobody actually had balls to try make game as hard as Starcraft  everyone marketed them hey look our game is much easier than SC. Maybe it works only in card games and shooters not in RTS.You know why Starcraft  and Age of Empires  are popular? Because you can beat banelings with marines and you can beat spearmen with cavliary. Scissors can beat rock if scissors is more skilled. Rock and Scissors may have equal chance if their skill is equal. Stuff like that never happen in games that have very low skill cap. Rock would win  of the time and everyone would play Rock vs Rock games.,RealTimeStrategy,dcdfwcg,2,t5_2sbgm
