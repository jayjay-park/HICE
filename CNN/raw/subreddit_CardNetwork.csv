4304042,0,t1_csas5ki,Thank you Jesse.  We appreciate hearing that.  Perhaps in the future well work on something with a more gaming related focus but we really wanted to do this to say thanks to everyone.One big concern was making it short enough that people would actually watch it but long enough to make each channel interesting.  I think we did great with that.Anyway constantly being exposed to your editing made us feel inadequate so it was nice to learn a few things and experiment some.  P.S.  Whats that iPUNKed Full TV show thing on your channel?  Seemed really cool but I didnt have time to watch much.,CardNetwork,csasgwk,1,t5_38hxh
