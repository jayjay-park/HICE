3463314,0,t3_2zwzu7,With Valencia and Atletico already off the schedule this is likely to be one of the three hardest remaining matches for Sevilla on paper at least.Im predicting that well see Iborra start at CAM again with Banega coming off the bench. Im really hoping that we can get an early lead and see Suarez Aspas and Reyes come in if theyre not starting.,LaLiga,cpn1jn8,2,t5_2s6wb
