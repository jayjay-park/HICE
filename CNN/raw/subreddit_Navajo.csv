3264932,0,t1_cp0f39h,Thanks. Any guess what it could be? Area code  is Utah along the Wasatch Front between Ogden and Provo in using all of SLC.Being a call from SLC I might have guessed Micronesian but it doesnt sound at all like any of those languages. It clearly had high and low tones nasal vowels and glottal stops. Gotta be something in the NaDen family you think?,Navajo,cp0fgj6,2,t5_2rvnn
6176743,0,t1_cyr6cel,My family weaves rugs have been for generations. We specialize in the two grey hills style. Honestly I just asked my mom and she took one look at it and said oh thats OLD! That could sell in the thousands at least k. Those should be in a museum. She could be wrong though I mean this is just what she saw from a picture ya know? I wouldnt know where to sell it though. I only know where to sell once a rug is done being woven not older ones. ,Navajo,cyrqcgf,2,t5_2rvnn

9447711,0,t3_59yzsr,Im glad the family was able to find some peace. Im also happy that this man can finally rest peacefully since his mother now knows what happened to her son. I cant imagine how much it would torture Ones soul especially a Mothers soul to have their child missing and no clue what happened. That would be far worse than knowing that he crossed over because you would spend everyday wondering if today is the day youll see your sondaughter again. It is a sad ending but I am glad that todays technology is finally bringing peace to those missing and cold cases. Im sure the technology today will help many people be able to finally know what happened to their loved ones. ,Navajo,d9dkaye,2,t5_2rvnn
