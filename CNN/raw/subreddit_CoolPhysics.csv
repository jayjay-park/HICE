4540979,0,t3_3d9imt,Heres the picture of the closest approachThis is the last and most detailed image sent to Earth before the spacecrafts closest approach to Pluto on July . The color image has been combined with lowerresolution color information from the Ralph instrument that was acquired earlier on July . This view is dominated by the large bright feature informally named the heart which measures approximately  miles  kilometers across. The heart borders darker equatorial terrains and the mottled terrain to its east right are complex. However even at this resolution much of the hearts interior appears remarkably featurelesspossibly a sign of ongoing geologic processes.,CoolPhysics,ct30ovp,3,t5_32ia0
