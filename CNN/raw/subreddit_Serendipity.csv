308242,0,t1_cfcpti0,ampampamp Lechatelierite gtgtLechatelierite is silica glass amorphous SiO. One common way in which lechatelierite forms naturally is by very high temperature melting of quartz sand during a lightning strike. The result is an irregular branching often foamy hollow tube of silica glass called a fulguritegtLechatelierite also forms as the result of high pressure shock metamorphism during meteorite impact cratering and is a common component of a type of glassy ejecta called tektites Most tektites are blobs of impure glassy material but tektites from the Sahara Desert in Libya and Egypt known as Libyan desert glass are composed of almost pure silica that is almost pure lechatelierite. High pressure experiments have shown that shock pressures of  GPa are needed to produce lechatelierite in quartz grains embedded in granite gtLechatelierite was formed during the impact of a meteorite into a layer of Coconino Sandstone at Meteor Crater in Arizona It was puffed up to more than twice its size by steam and can now float on water.gtgtImage iInteresting Fulgurite | Tektite | Paleolightning | Quartz ugigglpuff can delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfcptnd.

2345149,0,t3_2m4t68,Im just reposting my comment from rInfographics because I really want anyone who might be struggling with mental health to be able to read itIm so glad bipolar is depicted here... As someone who was diagnosed with depression over and over again for years I couldnt figure out why sometimes Id just snap out of it make grand plans for myself go party feel happy and get my energy back for a few weeks then bam... Months of depression. I had no idea there was a spectrum to bipolar disorder that mania isnt always as extreme as I remembered in health class and that some people barely get mania at all and just have persistent depression. If I had ever had a single person suggest that maybe I wasnt just depressed... Maybe I had something else going on too I could have saved years of painful assumptions and poor management of myself. I had tried every treatment for depression and I just never felt like my symptoms totally lined up was never suicidal still sociable when depressed so I thought I was just a broken human. Now Im on a mild antiseizure med no lithium for me phew! With barely noticeable side effects and I actually can function! Every day I reflect on how lucky I am to have been diagnosed at all how life isnt as complicated and seemingly impossible as I had once viewed it. So Im just really really pleased this image contains information on bipolar specifically when dealing with depression symptoms. Hopefully someone who is struggling and hasnt yet explored the possibility of bipolar will see this and it will ignite a curious spark that might lead to a more effective treatment,Serendipity,cm1klm0,3,t5_2ql4j

Youre probably dying to see some growth but every time you pick up the jars to inspect them you run the risk of letting some contams in.When you do handle them avoid touching the lid and especially avoid flexing the lid as this will cause air to be drawn into the jar and contams along with it.Best thing is to just put em in a shoe box and look inside in two weeks.,Serendipity,cpmu7qp,0,t5_2ql4j

But neither of these situations is nearly as common as simple rejection which gets called friendzone so that men can blame women for it.
