3864871,0,t1_cqvy62n,Am I the only one around here who browses through a few pages of top posts for every new subreddit I subscribe to? Its just such an easy way to catch up on good content without having to wait for gracious reposts.,storytellingvideos,cqwtvhi,2,t5_310ps
3864923,0,t1_cqwtyl6,Oh please. All Im saying is you dont need to repost old content as a favor to subscribers. Honestly my snark wasnt directed at you specifically more at the fact that your explanation has  points while they guy you were responding to was downvoted for making a legitimate observation.Anybody who cares to see good older content should know how to find it themselves by sorting by top. And if they didnt before maybe they do now. Or maybe theyll just downvote me and never check out the top content...not sure why Im even posting honestly.More power to ya.,storytellingvideos,cqwu354,2,t5_310ps
