701740,0,t3_225zrf,It is going to be difficult to do if you are under  years old. In state tuition is designed to benefit true residents of the state and is specifically purposed so that undergraduate students who only plan to be there for  years wont be able to take advantage. I am a graduate student and I was able to get in state by buying a vehicle and registering it in my name switching my ID to Colorado and registering to vote as soon as I moved and paying income tax in Colorado through my internship.  Even after doing all this I still couldnt get instate tuition until I had lived in the state for  months. This is not the only way to get instate tuition but Im sorry to tell you it will be difficult for a traditional undergrad student to get instate tuition.,ColoradoSchoolOfMines,cgk1gqr,1,t5_2spd5

5861921,0,t1_cxnwenk,Mines IT here. We are all out for the weekend indeed meaning theres nobody manning the income queue to route your request to the proper people and the proper people are not there to act on it even if it did get routed. Unfortunately we are not staffed for afterhours operation which I think we should be.Hang in there though someone will certainly reply to your request Monday morning.,ColoradoSchoolOfMines,cxo10f8,4,t5_2spd5

9901406,0,t3_5d5dkt,I took Critical Perspectives in th Century World Literature with Tina Gianquitto LAIS . We read Conrads Hear of Darkness Virginia Woolfs Mrs. Dalloway George Orwells  and Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man. We wrote three papers total and took one midterm. The exam was absurdly easy I dont think anyone got less than an  and she gives everyone two opportunities for the papers. Basically you write them and turn them in she grades them and the tells you what corrections you need to get a higher grade. Very fair very straightforward. We also watched Fight Club Citizen Kane and Crash. ,ColoradoSchoolOfMines,day6cow,2,t5_2spd5

10446905,0,t3_5pl7qa,Freshman student here! . I have friends in that major and they seem to like it a lot. Im not personally in that major. . Not sure. Send an email to admissions and ask them. They are usually pretty quick. We do use a a program called Mathematica that is basically wolfram alpha but better and more complex.  It may be worth taking regardless. You will probably have to take a short form about a month long class I think calc  class. . Undergrads are frequently involved in research often as assistants. The pay is supposed to be pretty good and if you do a lot for the project depending on the lead you might even get your name put on the paper! . My favorite thing about Mines has got to be the people. I havent seen a more helpful and humorous group of people anywhere.  Also be prepared for need humor if you come here. ,ColoradoSchoolOfMines,dcs8tof,3,t5_2spd5
