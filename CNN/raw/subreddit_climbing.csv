If you focus on specific poses you will not progress as fast as if you practiced a full range of poses from that style of Yoga.  You may not realize it but that stupid downward dog pose will build muscle strength and flexibility for more complex poses.  Myself I do Bikrams Yoga the hot yoga and each pose in the series builds on each other you need the spine strengthening floor series in order to do better at the standing poses the spine strengthening poses help you keep your balance and sort out your alignment when doing the standing poses.  The standing poses help immensely with your flexibility and breathing which makes the floor series bearable.

We were both climbing . in the gym but stayed . or below that first trip. On my second climb I fell while clipping the fourth bolt. My feet slipped off because I lost focus for a sec.  I felt totally under control and suddenly I was falling. It happened so fast that I fell about ? feet before I even realized what was going on. As soon as I realized I wasnt dead I let out some primordial scream of awesomeness. My belayer didnt know what happened and thought I broke something. He asked what I needed and I said I was great. I finished the route and the both of us have been climbing outside since. Now we try to get out as much as possible and do a big trip once a year. Last year we climbed five days in Colorado and we are headed to learn trad in Red Rocks Vegas with a guide in February.

Get yourself a pair of jeans with a bit of lycra in them usually they are made with  lycra and you will get the look of the hardman while still getting the stretch you need to actually learn to use technique while you climb.x a week should yield improvement quickly if you are consistent with your climbing. If you show up climb two routes and then chat for the rest of the night you arent going to see improvement showing up climbing  routes and spending gt hour actually on the wall is going to get your body into the swing of things faster.When you are a new climber its easy to want to gauge your progress by reading the grades on the climbs and judging yourself by them. Dont fall into this trap. Spend your time at the gym paying careful attention to how other people climb especially people who are floating up the wall the people who look like they are climbing effortlessly. Try to force yourself to move like they do. If no one at your gym is an inspiring climber check out any of the numerous videos online of top climbers and watch how they do it.,climbing,cf53zoa,1,t5_2qk72

As he was trying to clip in the leader fell from the second bolt and his belayer lost hold of the brake end and out went all the slack.  The leader hit his head on a rock when he decked and went into a seizure.  Blood was coming out of his ear.  He likely had internal bleeding in the cranial region.  We organized a litter carry and called the ambulance to come.  Carried him out and he went to hospital.  I dont know his current status.

569734,0,t3_20npk7,Now is a fine time to join a gym.  If you think you will go during the summer then do it.  Gym populations shift with the seasons.  The most serious climbers people who Train For Climbing tend to climb indoors year round.  There is also a growing number of people who dont really have a ton of interest in climbing outside.  The gym is a social workout for them.  They stick around in the summer too.  The summer also sees a boost in new climbers because people just prefer to leave the house and do interesting things when its not cold and miserable.  The gym will probably see a decline in avid outdoor climbers over the summer months but theyll all be back eventually.tldr The gym will have a different vibe in the summer but its still a fun place to hang out and get stronger.,climbing,cg5188p,5,t5_2qk72

642888,0,t1_cgdbv7d,While I agree with your overall viewpoint I have to disagree with your reasoning.  I do not think that the setters are compromising their work.  A great route is still interesting and fun to climb and a grade is just a number assigned to ones work.At the gym I set at Ive constantly had people tell me my grading is too stiff or too soft and often times I get differing opinions on the same route.   That being said if the general trend for most of my routes is people saying they are too stiff then I will try to adjust my grading.  I say that it is unprofessional not to adjust ones grading if  or more of the climbers say that your grading is stiff.  I feel it would be selfish to go around telling everyone that they are all wrong and that I am the ultimate authority on the subject.Basically route setting is fun but grades are hard.  Everyone has their own opinion on what routes should be graded and that comes down to a person their style and their strengths.  Almost all routes are at least somewhat disputed in terms of their grade.My advice?  Just enjoy the route for what it is.  Whether it made you think had great movement or had something youve never done before appreciate the hard work the setter put into make it just for you.  Grades are just an indicator giving you an idea of the general difficulty.  They are not and will never be absolute.,climbing,cgdchzl,2,t5_2qk72

682840,1,t3_21zcu6,As far as weight lifting just know your body. A lot of guys weight lift to supplement climbing burn they usually do low weights high reps for muscle endurance as well as some strength training. Ultimately you want a positive strengthweight ratio. Biggest pet peeve of mine with weight lifting is most people dont know how to do it properly. The weekend warrior types thing that high intensity is the way to go and it isnt.If you have been climbing less than a year the biggest thing that will help is just climbing a lot more. I dont mean climbing at your peak more but just in general. If you climb at a . level climb s and s. Also do you lead or top rope? How is your technique? Strength will get you to ish grades but anything higher you will need good technique. Also because of your arm do low intensity but high volume. Climb a shit ton of  and  routes to help improve the tendon in your arm.Just my  cents. Im sure other more experienced climbers can give you a more in depth idea.TlDr Weight lifting can help if done right. Consult climbing coaches andor personal fitness trainers. Climb low intensity high volume routes until your arm can handle the more stressful routes.,climbing,cghw1st,1,t5_2qk72

794686,0,t3_237y9f,On vertical walls try to keep your body and therefore your center of gravity close to the wall. If your body protrudes too much from the wall your center of gravity will pull you away from the holds and you need a lot more arm strength to hang on them. To practice find some good footholds and balance on them you should be able to almost stay on the wall using your feet only just using your hands mostly for balance.Overhangs are different as your center of balance will not be able to stay close to the wall. Try to keep straight arms if possible and use your legs to brace and push your way up to the next hand hold. Eventually youll learn other techniques like drop knees and flagging that will help with this.,climbing,cgulxxn,1,t5_2qk72

1064267,0,t3_26ahmi,Main things to keep in mind Use  or  plywood... any thinner and the holds will spin If youre going to paint it paint it before you drill the tnut holes.  Textured deckpaint is recommended. Follow the instructions on the atomik website above on tnut spacing.  Its nicer to have them staggered than just a verticalhorizontal grid. Use a  spade bit for drilling the tnut holes.  I used the Bosch Daredevil spade bit and really liked itmuch better than others that Ive used in the past. You probably dont need that much in the way of bracing i.e. xs should be sufficient if the wall is going to be the size that you mentioned and vertical.   offcenter is probably still the way to go.  If you use Atomiks tnut pattern you wont have to worry about the tnuts being blocked by studs. Many companies make climbing holds that are comfortable enough for barefoot climbing.  It sounds like those might be appropriate for this situation.EDIT Of course almost all of that assumes that you want to use bolton holds.  If you want to use screwons then its a lot less work.  However I think it would be cool for her to be able to set her own problems and that would be a lot easiersafer with bolts rather than screws.  Also you wont have a bunch of screws poking out of the back of the plywood which is also a lot safer.,climbing,chp9fhu,9,t5_2qk72

Ground falls have always been what scares me about leading but last week I fractured my ankle falling at the anchors of a climb.  So no matter how far off the ground you are it can be dangerous.

He was on crutches with  leg in a splint and  leg in pain... he had some road rash and stuff but other then that fine..gtHe said they waited for like  minutes before calling YOSAR to see if he could get down by him self but he couldnt so they made a little fire and chilled out waiting for YOSAR... YOSAR had to lower him down a little bit and that was an unforseen problem so they did it kind of jangus like because they didnt bring the full on lowering tools with them.

1346148,0,t1_ciksqf0,Wow I couldnt disagree more.  Dynamic climbing can be so helpful and there are so many times when its not a move of desperation but necessary.Dynamic climbing should be a part of any climbers technique its quite often the most efficient way to move.  Dynamic climbing means using momentum and using your hips and your legs.  This can save so much in terms of forearm endurance on sport climbs and obviously so many boulders have dynamic moves.  Moving dynamically is so much more than just big dynos but even being able to dyno will come in handy at some point in a climbers career.  Dynos get a bad rap because a lot of intermediate climbers think theyre flashy and show off with them but damn near every good boulderer I know can move dynamically when needed.  Edit also telling a new climber to practice their lockoffs is pretty ridiculous.  ,climbing,cil22z1,6,t5_2qk72

But if youre in a conversation or something and momentarily vague out  then at some points during the process youre leaving your climber un protected.At some point you have to move your braking hand up the rope so you either let go unprotected and slide it up or you have to quickly lock off with your nonbraking hand then move your braking hand up. complicated.And in my view complicatedunprotectedTwo hands on the braking end means that you can be constantly locked off except for the brief time youre taking in and you can move your hands up with letting go.My favorite is the enthusiastic supportive parents who take in the rope for their kid but then leave both their hands up in the air without locking off... as if theyre waiting for exactly the right moment to lock off.Step  in your diagram can be made less tiring by adjusting the height of the floor anchor correctly and clipping the belay device through your belay loop instead of your harness which puts it in the right orientation to not cause as much drag.,climbing,civfc6n,-7,t5_2qk72

If I came on this setup I definitely wouldnt have waited  minutes.  I probably would have moved the ropes aside and lead through.  If they still werent back by the time I was at the top I would have dropped their rope and claimed the climb.  A decent amount of Guides and groups use Mt. Erie but you cant occupy climbs that you arent climbing.  Its bad form for sure.  I would definitely coil their rope and leave whatever they used for an anchor neatly on top.  If they came back offer to put their rope back up.Even though its a dick move taking their gear as a few people suggested would be even more assholeish and the best thing to do is to be nice and accommodating about it.

1819867,0,t1_ck8h13m,A static  ton block is the same as around an .kN fall but there are differences in pull directions and setup as uGeesusChrist noted. So no the forces are pretty much the same but the configuration is very different.Failures due to gear breaking are essentially unheard of normally the failure is due to how the user configured the system.However if you put kN of force on the climbers end of the rope  through a top piece and back down to a belayer then the climber feels kN the belayer feels kN the top piece feels kN since its holding both of them.BUT kN is very close to the peak force generated by a fall. Its rope dependant and tends to be between  kN peak for a factor two fall. Most lead falls are closer to kN.,climbing,ck8h9nh,3,t5_2qk72

1836176,0,t1_cka9tuv,My first experience with trad climbing was with a guide Mark Beverly Beverly Mtn Guides. Anyway he made me read these studies about holding power analyses of different types of gear anchors etc... One of the studies was set up to question the effect of shitty gear in the system. The conclusion of the study was that generally any positive slowing down effects of shitty gear blowing out were cancelled out or possibly outweighed by negative shock loading effects on gear below. If you think about it it makes sense the rope is the primary dynamic force reducing component but whenever gear blows the rope usually doesnt have a chance to release the tension built up from weighting the top piece and it ends up shock loading the piece below. Anyway my  cents I usually dont bother placing gear I am sure will pop but sometimes awful gear holds and obviously some gear is better than no gear! Another interesting tidbit from the study  they showed that knot tightening is a statistically significant force reducer and could explain a lot of anecdotes where a piece held one fall and popped after a second fall. They suggested that if some questionable gear holds a fall you can always lower and retie your knot though I have never actually done this myself.,climbing,ckageeu,6,t5_2qk72

Remembering that climbing wall experience is NOT the same as outdoor climbing and clipping bolts on lead is very different from placing gear. But in looking for partners dont forget that you need to bring something to the partnership too. Do you have your own gear yet? Shoes harness helmet belay gear? Do you have any of the communal gear needed to climb? Ropes rack etc. Id suggest that you . Keep climbing at your local wall and try and make some contacts there. You need to build up experience. .  Make a plan to start buying the essential gear. Save money. Earn money. Climbing in all its forms is cheapish once you have the kit but the initial outlay is expensive. Lot of nd hand gear on ukclimbing.com. Get active on ukclimbing.com. Ask questions participate in debates. Itll be your best source for partners in years to come other than a club at Uni. And its a great source of info. .  Look at the membership requirements of the UK Alpine Club. Itll give you something to aim for and will be another source of partners and noncommercial expeditions. .  Look into joining the UK Eagle Ski Club. They run some great training courses that might fit with your holidays which teach offpiste skills skimountaineering and general winter alpine skills. Also lots of weeklong trips that you might be able to join. Not sure on minimum age.. A lot of UK organisations offer youth grants for various kinds of training and trips. You are probably still too young but you wont be for long. Do your research now so you can take advantage as soon as you are old enough. .

1925870,0,t3_2go7sh,Currently there is a statutory bar on collecting fees in National Forests and areas managed by the BLM for simple activities that are limited to parking hiking or sightseeing as well as others.  The statute is fairly straightforward   Despite the plain text of the statute the US Forest Service has repeatedly tried to collect fees from hikers and others who park in popular areas.  Despite having their ass handed to them by the Ninth Circuit for this   the Forest Service continues to collect the fees and threaten people who dont purchase the passes.The bill under consideration would strip the current statute of the bars on collecting fees for the following USC d  A Solely for parking undesignated parking or picnicking along roads or trailsides.B For general access unless specifically authorized under this section.C For dispersed areas with low or no investment unless specifically authorized under this section.D For persons who are driving through walking through boating through horseback riding through or hiking through Federal recreational lands and waters without using the facilities and services.E For camping at undeveloped sites that do not provide a minimum number of facilities and services as described in subsection gA.F For use of overlooks or scenic pullouts.As a result basically the Forest Service or BLM could institute programs or continue current illegal fee collection programs for anyone accessing public lands in undeveloped areas simply to hike or sightsee for example.  Although not likely this would hypothetically allow them to charge anyone driving through a National Forest who simply stops to gaze at the view.  More likely they would institute fee programs that would require payment for parking in specified areas or anywhere in the National Forests or on BLM managed lands.  ,climbing,ckl94u8,1,t5_2qk72

2220617,0,t1_clm2umh,Im personally not a fan of Rockfax guides which is why I didnt mention it in my previous post.The reason I dont like them is because they repeatedly piggyback on the work and efforts of local activists who have done the hard work developing and equipping crags and arranging access where required and rarely give anything back to the funds that help those doing the work in the areas from the sales of their guides.  This happens not just in the UK see here for the author of the Definitive North Wales Limestones Pete Harrison consternation about Rockfaxs select North Wales guide which ended up having far greater coverage of the limestone areas than first stipulated but also abroad in areas such as Buoux Spain Calanques.  Guidebook authors in the Buoux area produce this image to highlight the issue of Vampire Topos as they call them...Its basically a principled stance I take and encourage in others because by buying definitive guides from those who developed areas it helps support their ongoing efforts at maintaining the crags and access to them.The GroundUp guide I recommended does a lot of work in North Wales documenting bouldering they published the first North Wales bouldering guide to the area updating guides for Gogarth which the Climbers Club appear to have no will to do and helping with the North Wales bolt fund not just for Limestone they helped Pete produce his guide but also the Dinorwig Slate quarries near Llanberis there is a separate guide to this and its an excellent area some of it is covered by the North Wales Rock guide.  Well worth a visit as its very quick drying but slate is horrible when its wet.In this particular case if youre driving from South Wales to North Wales over  days there will be enough in any one of the Climbers Clubs definitive guide books to keep you occupied for the few days youll be in Pembroke and to try and dash around between the different areas wouldnt in my opinion be a great use of your time.,climbing,clm3dpf,1,t5_2qk72

JP Auclair was one of the more sensible skiers out there and he died in an avalanche this year. Using safety equipment does not make you safe. Big mountain skiing is like RX climbing on choss. You can place all the gear you want but it might all pull when a random hold breaks. I dont see how getting dragged off a cliff by an avalanche is more acceptable than falling while free soloing. The bottom line is absolute risk not relative risk.

The big danger here was the iceberg collapsing or rolling not one of them falling on slabby ice. Rope and screws would have increased the danger youll notice when the earlier berg collapsed they downclimbed instead of rapping off because being roped to unstable ice is significantly more dangerous than soloing.

2702084,0,t3_2r0cet,In multipitch trad you probably dont have much choice as the belayer will be tied to the anchor after the st pitch. A soft catch is difficult unless you rig a chariot belay. You can add some dynamics if you wear gloves and are very skilled with a non locking belay device. IOW not a GriGri. And you should be wearing gloves when belaying a leader on a tube device anyways. Seriously a significant rope burn can lead to skin grafting and loss of an entire climbing season.EDIT The last couple of sentences are kind of dogmatic. Sorry about that. Its my opinion. I started off using gloves with a hip belay. Stopped when I started using a tube device. Started up again after many years and seeing what can happen. People should do what they think best.In single pitchsport there are some options people have tried. Such as tying to the ground anchor with a long slack loop. The idea is that the belayer will be lifted and provide some energy absorption until her acceleration flattens  and then not so much. The goal of the slack ground anchor is to allow some dynamics but not have her smash into the st bolt. Others have tried some additional weight such as sandbags or a pack. Whether wearing it or tying to it.Here are two links that might helpAs a counterpoint a fixed point leader belay is sometimes being used in Europe. Be aware of a hard catch and significantly higher loads on your top piece. A chariot belay is created by the belayer hanging himself some distance below the belay on a tether formed using the rope. ,climbing,cnb7t5p,20,t5_2qk72

The anchor clip involved holding a pincher and some really awkward feet and I was already super pumped out from the day.  Im not sure how close I actually was to the big squares behind me or how much of a risk it actually was but I knew theyd hurt if I fell on them.Usually on vertical stuff the clipping stances are more solid at least to me and I have more endurance than I do strength so they come more naturally.  ,climbing,cnjn7j9,1,t5_2qk72

You want to learn to rest without hanging on the rope learn to trust your body over the rope etc.  If you rely too much on the rope your technique will be sloppy and not translate well to lead.  If you have good technique on top rope there are plenty of routes that wont be more difficult on lead than they are on top rope.  One big thing is communicating with your belayer so theyre not keeping the rope super tight all the time which well help prevent you from accidentally relying on it.,climbing,cnkq4us,2,t5_2qk72

With that said the rubber is super thick and the shoes may feel a little clunky at first.  However after the rubber wears down a bit the sensitivity of the shoes becomes much better.  Personally as someone on a tight budget I prefer the thicker toe rubber since the shoes last longer.  Aside from the smell and the fact that they dont smear well I think they are great shoes.  I actually prefer the Nexxo to the Shaman but if you go with the Nexxo you may want to consider going a half size up from what you wear in Shamans.,climbing,cnr9m18,1,t5_2qk72

2893918,0,t3_2t8zgp,Hey guyI literally started yesterday and Im already in love. I have a bouldering gym pretty much means no ropes down the street from me that I never even knew about until a coworker mentioned it to me. The best way to go about doing this is to just find a gym near you and go. Dont be shy about it either. I literally walked into the gym and there were at least  people in there and I went to the guy at the desk and said hey man I dont know what to do but I want to learn everything I can The guy rented me some shoes and showed me what everything was.Then I just stood around for a couple minutes saying hey to everyone and dont feel awkward if I watch you for a while I just want to learn. About a half hour later I met some really nice people who are regulars and they encouraged me to try some of the easier routes. I had a good time even though I was just doing Vs and Vs the easy routes.I am a pretty thin guy and I need to bulk up a bit more on my upperbody strength but Id definitely come back to this gym as the environment was very relaxed and the regulars and employees were very friendly.Im going to go a few more times to see how much I really like it and then Ill probably get a membership at the gym.So my advice is to just go to a gym say hi to everyone and just tell everyone youre new and have no idea what youre doing. There will certainly be people there who wont mind showing you how its all done.,climbing,cnx1j5j,4,t5_2qk72

2937339,0,t3_2ts1fa,All pro athletes are advertising tools for the sponsors. All. Every single one. A company will not sponsor an athlete unless it sees some merit in doing so. That merit comes down to  can this person bring us in more money? There are many different ways an athlete can achieve this for the sponsor. One is obviously to climb at a very high level. This can be outdoors or comps or both. Your name gets out there and by association the sponsor also gets recognition. You can develop a whole bunch of stuff and have a strong presence even if you dont necessarily climb very hard. You can produce a lot of media. Many different factors are considered and there is no single metric.In the case of Sierra BlairCoyle she does not climb that hard in any respectable standard. Her hardest bouldering ascent is Paleozoic in Hueco Tanks. That climb has broken into oblivion and does not deserve any higher than V in its current state. She also says she has never boulder V outside. So Im going to say the hardest shes really climbed is V. If youre talking about merit based on climbing ability alone this is a joke. What makes up for this is that shes insanely hot. That in and of itself brings a lot of attention. Tie that in with her social media presence and it actually makes a lot of sense for companies to sponsor her.This works the same for everyone else out there. For example Daniel Woods does not have much of a media presence. Theres media of him but he doesnt produce them. But just considering his abilities and all the attention that comes with it he can pull a Marshawn Lynch and will still be sponsorworthy. Honnlove doesnt necessarily climb the hardest but the media frenzy over freesoloing serves him the merit.,climbing,co1zl8k,17,t5_2qk72

So if youre bouldering find a V you can do and practice it with your footwork as quiet and smooth as possible and with your arms extended as much as possible until it no longer tires you out.Every single climb and every single move is an opportunity to practice your technique.

3758857,0,t3_33fahg,The staple in the cliff anchor link and some eyebolts are only at the section of Otter Cliffs above A Dare by the Sea and climbers right part of Wonder Wall. For the rest youll have to build your own anchors either with gear or by slinging some of the large boulders. Tree anchors are off limits. Most guides seem to bring about  meters of static line.IIRC the accident you referenced happened in a part of Otter Cliffs that is not on the MP topo its in a section further south and it has been difficult to find out exactly what happened to cut that rope. Generally I do not find the edges at Otter Cliff to be particularly sharp  with the exception of the area to climbers left of Overhanging Corner.  But since you start at the top of Otter Cliff and either rap or lower off most topropers top belay instead of bottom belay. If you insist on a bottom belay extend your anchor over the edge and pad it with a towel. You will not need the Petzl edge roller. Let me reiterate that top belay at Otter Cliff is more efficient easier and having someone at the top makes it easier to get out if you cant climb the route you selected. You can also manage where the climbing rope is going. Once you both are down at the bottom there is no easy way to scramble back out without getting wet  or swept out to sea....

I have about  draws now which definitely feels like overkill but Ill probably buy some long webbing and turn about  of them into cm length draws.To answer your questions I would like to think most of the big name brands will be consistent with their products so whatever you buy should be reliable. In terms of length usually the long draws are the better way to go since it can make clipping somewhat easier and it tends to reduce rope drag on longwandering routes,climbing,cr246q8,4,t5_2qk72

For trad Ill generally clove hitch into the anchor with the rope in addition to my sling.

4316860,0,t1_csc6i1c,The injury is certainly related to overuse and the nature of it depends on where it hurts. There are lots of things that can get hurt from climbing. There is a whole pulley system of ligaments which hold your tendons near to your finger bones which are easily inflamed  torn.  Also your finger tendons in general can get inflamed  torn.  Your joints can swell causing pain as well synovitis.  You can hurt your hand muscles the lumbricals. Often times you will hear and feel a pop at the moment of a tear but not always.  Finger pain is one of the most common issues with climbing particularly for beginners.  The ligaments and tendons take a very long time to adapt monthsyears relative to your muscles weeksmonths.  The bad news is that one way or another you are bound to have some hurting stuff in your hands  forearms one way or another pretty much always.  The good news is that to heal them you do not have to stop climbing.  In fact because of the poor circulation in those types of tissues and the way that the tissues reconstruct themselves absolute rest is one of the worst options.  They need light stress and usage to get the blood flowing to them and to help them heal.In general listen to your body.  Dont climb every day.  Maybe dont even climb every other day.  Dont climb hard if things hurt.  Dont climb until things hurt so bad you are forced to stop.Dont take ibuprofen before you climb to mask the pain  Do warm up like crazy before climbing harder things. Do climb in such a manner that doesnt aggravate things that hurt. Do massage and exercise your hands  forearms with very high rep  low weight exercises particularly eccentric movements  rice bucket rubber bands theraputty etc.. Do ice andor take ibuprofen after you climb if you like. So if your hands feel up to it in a day or so hit the gym again and climb some easy stuff.  Avoid crimping.  Stick to jugs and open hand stuff.  Warm up for a good    minutes.  Spend some sessions working footwork and technique instead of hard pulling.  Stop immediately and pack it in for the day if it doesnt feel right at any time or if any pain increases vs decreases during your warmup.,climbing,csc8k5t,5,t5_2qk72

4367175,0,t3_3b1cmt,StoryI was  day into a  week business trip to San Jose. I always bring my shoes when I travel to check out the local gyms and bring home a shirt as a souvenir of my travels.  minutes into a bouldering session I fall from the last move of an overhanging problem and land on a crash pad  feet below. Butt hits the pad right arm goes back and doesnt hit the pad hits the lower mat and snaps back. The dude next to me when I fell asked if I was alright and I just looked at my arm and said yeah but my arm is broken. He was like are you serious? and to confirm I bent it backwards. Adrenaline is a hell of a painkiller because I didnt feel a thing until the ride to the hospital. Ive seen videos of people having crazy injuries like this but it was unreal experiencing it first hand. Im sitting there looking at my arm bending backwards and all I can think is god dammit.. I cant believe I just broke my arm. I have my wedding in  days and now Ill be a cast for it. I got up to try to find my friend and I think the employees were a little shocked I wasnt freaking out more in fact they were more frantic than me. very helpful though. Helped me get my shoes off gave me some water and ice and helped hold my arm in a comfortable position as I waited for my friend to get his car to take me to the hospital. I was probably in shock myself which is why I was able to stay pretty calm.. I dont think it had fully hit me yet that this was not going to be something Id bounce back from in a week like previous minor climbing injuriesThis happened on Monday. Today is Wednesday and I just met the orthopedist to get the halfcast off. Good news is no break in the bone so once the swelling goes down I should get full range of motion back. Been climbing for a while and still make a rookie mistake the first day at a new gym. Shit sucksDont be an idiot like me.  edit worst part I didnt even get a shirt to remember the worst climbing trip of my lifeEdit  day  here is the current bruiseedit  Woot! The gym manager just called to check in. She is going to send me a shirt and even offered to give me a free visit once Im healed. Super impressed with how well the gym handled it.Here is the current bruise on day Edit  five days Color is fading but its spread out a lot. Swelling has gone down a lot.

Most would not categorize it as progress.  gt  Look at Roadside Crag in the Red River Gorge. It was closed because of climbers abusing the area and ignoring the rules and it was reopened when climbers agreed to respect the closure and limited access.Prime example.

4756572,0,t1_ctmn0nm,Sorry for the slow reply was out of town.  I guess my elbow comment was a little vague.  What I mean is that it helped me to selfanalyze my movements.  Easiest way to identify if the way Im using each hold as efficiently as possible is to look at which way my elbow is pointing as that is the direction of force when I pull up on it.  REALLY helps with slopers and maybe even more so with sidepullangled crimps.  Im still being vague unfortunately but it really brought into focus the moments when instead of being efficient I was just muscling through holds with bad footwork and finger placements.Edit  In terms of slopers specifically angling your bodyweight correctly is super critical.  Mentally noting and adjusting how you are weighting each hold will significantly increase your efficiency and cut down the sweat since youre getting less pumped out.  Its way harder to just muscle through slopers hence so many forearms junkies like myself constantly at war with them,climbing,ctu40p9,1,t5_2qk72

4887688,0,t3_3hto8c,iXTalll looked down. The primitives were gathered below jostling to get a better look at his position. Some even appeared set to begin the arduous climb to reach him which should not have been possible given their limited means. When the climbers had first been discovered somewhere around pitch four some of the primitives had even attempted to hit them with crude projectiles but in the time since the noisy fire had ceased. This is all your fault Sciiib chemmed. We should never have come here. iXTall smiled rubbed his aching forearms and reflected on the situation. Their goal a great volcanic mountain on the th planet had been engulfed in a storm that would have made landing impossible let alone climbing. This third planet had challenging conditions but came with a problem  primitive inhabitants. A survey drone had passed through the system just a few cycles ago and found this one planet suitable for life and  more importantly  topography suitable for climbing. The inhabitants ought not to have been advanced enough to pose a serious risk. The enormous climactic range also meant that some areas were comfortably hospitable to his people. iXTalll and Sciiib having slipped past the rangers had come too far to be denied by a little bad weather. Being spotted by an intelligent species was a serious breach of extrasolar climbing etiquette. Even preindustrial species could be indelibly marked by contact with an offworlder  let alone a pair of illegal climbers. This area should have been bereft of the dominant species barely able to travel at these latitudes. To see a group of them here let alone finding a party hastily preparing to climb was unthinkable. The rangers are going to tear us to shreds when they find out about this. If we make it out of here alive well be blacklisted from the alpine alliance and exiled from Insallla Prime. We should pry boulders loose and crush them while they cluster at the base of the cliff. The wind picked up accentuating the exposure. iXTalll preened for a moment and considered this course of action. In a way it made sense. This group of natives appeared isolated none of the structures they huddled in at lower latitudes were present here. The crime would go unnoticed or be blamed on a natural rockfall event. But why were they here? Could the locals be attempting this climb for themselves? If so  had a filthy primitive already stolen his first ascent of this the greatest sheer face the planet had to offer?The idea of extraterrestrial visitors smiting fellow climbers with rocks from above held a sort of terrible irony. The partners had agreed long ago to adhere to traditional climbing techniques  no liquid pitons no countergravity measures and no AI support. What meager weaponry they had brought was left in the dropship. It would have put a shock of terror into these primitives but who would take such things climbing? They were weighed down as it was with climbing protection food atmospherics and kreahn. Looking around iXTalll doubted they could even pry loose enough rock to do the job properly. We cannot kill them. If we are found to have killed so rare a species the consequences would be far worse than trespassing in a nature preserve. We cannot descend and escape we would be caught and risk contracting some primitive contagion. iXTalll paused choosing his words carefully. What would you have us do? Sciiib interjected. We cannot delay further or they will reach us! Up replied iXTalll smiling at his partner. We climb. ,climbing,cuamqhw,17,t5_2qk72

Everyone is wearing athletic apparel.ANW prides itself on showmanship and Drew Dreschel the competitor you couldnt even be bothered to name displayed that during his run.

5162966,0,t3_3lpfgg,The first thing I always do is look at the rock from the base. If it looks like there is a potential route I hike to the top and clean off loose stuff then drill and install an anchor or multiple anchors. I then lower down using a grigri and ascender and clean loose stuff and look more closely at the rock. If I decide to bolt a potential line I first look at the harder parts and figure out what holds can manage a clip and figure out safe places to put bolts. Once the harder parts are figured out I worry about the rest of the route and usually climb them on top rope and mark bolt locations with chalk. After all the bolts are placed I climb the route to make sure nothing needs to be moved or added. If its an especially steep route I do the same thing but when lowering I use a combination of aid gear and temporary bolts to lower and clean without flying away from the wall.

5303239,0,t1_cvpja6g,gtI thought you were considering the Mammut Smart belay to avoid using the ATC? Basically all the belay devices have the same basic hand positions but some have extra features that make locking off easier or automatic. From what I have seen operating the Mammut was very similar to the ATC while the Grigri had a brake lever and seemed like you released it to lower a climber I could be completely wrong and if it failed it could convert to an ATC in order to get the climber down safely I could be completely wrong about this as well.gtIt is fine learning on a Grigri and then learning an ATC. If you use a grigri regularly in the safest manner then you will know how to use an ATC. If you use the Grigri haphazardly then going to an ATC will be a problem.I may have to just make the jump to the Grigi as I do like it and if it will not be an issue to jump straight to it it would save a needless purchase of  devices.,climbing,cvpju6x,1,t5_2qk72

5408725,0,t3_3p4djq,Those two models are very different.  Both great.  First of all they fit differently.  Scarpas are generally wider and have a bigger heel cup.  Regardless of the design differences if you have narrowed it down to those two models you should get the one that fits better.  One will definitely fit better than the other.  Katana Lace are designed to be very supportive and stiff.  They have the P midsole which makes them excellent for edging.  Furias have very much a lack of support with literally no midsole.  They are sensitive.  You can feel and better utilize tiny variances in rock for smearing.  They are better for agressive overhung climbs as well.The rubber on each shoes emphasizes these differences.  Katana Lace come with XSEdge and Furias with XSGrip.  Edge is slightly thicker stiffer and more durable.  Much better for edging.  Grip thinner more flexible sensitive and grippier.  Better for smearing and overhangs.

5476429,0,t3_3q2nsx,Listen to ufallsapart.  You need to make sure your crampons fit your boots.  You need to make sure you buy crampons with the right binding system.  Get semiauto crampons for boots without toe welts and automatic crampons for boots with toe welts.  Also you need to make sure the crampon will attach to your boot correctly.  I have a pair of Vasque boots and Grivel crampons will not work with them even though they have the correct binding system.  Dont try to use strap on crampons with hiking boots.  They wont work.  As far as tools go.  I would suggest the BD Viper.  It has a nice forgiving swing and preforms well on vertical ice.  The Grivel Xblade isnt bad either but the stamped shaft makes it feel springy and the swing is not as nice.  They are kind of weird.  The Xblade is more meant for mixed terrain.  ,climbing,cwbnyd5,2,t5_2qk72

Are they unfair to consumers?Ive been considering reporting them to the attorney general for unfair consumer practices. I dont think their  day policy makes any real sense. Just cause its in writing doesnt mean its right. Just cause I signed it doesnt mean i cant work to make sure that others dont fall into it. Consider this Does BKB absolutely need  days to forecast their sales to maintain afloat?  Does BKB need  days to change a name in a database? what Constitutes a reasonable amount of time to cancel a subscription when everything is electronic.if the answers to these questions is less than  days. Then this is an unreasonable practice that wrongs the consumera la timevaluemoney. BKB isnt a startup and my membership is not a investment. In a bad case Say  people forget before to cancel and cannot climb.  x    in revenue including the Cost of goods sold  if these people cannot climb for whatever reason.  days is half a month. you can phrase it like you only have half a month to decide if you want to climb next month.

See if you can hold that edge.  Hard to say without seeing how the rest of your body is and where your hand options are. Another option maybe is to put your right hand down on the hold.

After a year of climbing in them almost exclusively both in the gym and outside ropes and boulders I got a pair of FiveTen MocAsyms a much softer neutral shoe although I still downsized the crap out of them.After climbing in nothing but Mocs for months I tried on some Evolv Shamans again pretty stiff moderately downturned and hated them instantly. They were stiff thick lifeless I couldnt feel the rock or plastic underneath my toes. A month or two later I found some new Miuras nd hand for cheap and picked them up again I hated them thick stiff lifeless.A year later Ive had the privilege to try many more shoes. I primarily boulder for what its worth. Outside I usually warm up in Mocs and put on Dragons when I want to try real hard. In the gym I have a pair of Team VXis that work really well softest shoe ever. If Im on ropes a rare thing either outside or in the gym and need to edge Im probably wearing that old pair of Miuras that I fear will never wear out.My point here is that youre relatively new Id highly recommend you stick with soft shoes for awhile.

6020494,0,t1_cy8t0hl,I think youve hit the nail on the head there.When people first start climbing they often arent aware of what they dont know are keen as mustard get a bit competitive with one another and dont think so much about the consequences of what they are doing.In university clubs you have a whole load of people who generally have at the most  years of experience of being in charge of themselves. So  years seems like very experienced and  year seems like experienced. Also people dont mix so much with older climbers so dont notice this or notice where bad habits maay have become the norm so much.The thing about climbing is that you are always looking at building in redundancy so even if one part of the system fails you have other options a lot of the time at the grades that most people climb at. But people get lazy about it or simply arent aware of the need for it. Also if climbers dont think about the physics and mechanics behind their rope work if they are just following the rules that they have been shown as a simple    set of instructions then accidents are more likely.,climbing,cy8t7km,2,t5_2qk72

You can do it as part of the club and use some of the dues to pay for a bulk membership there if it goes through and is agreed upon by the club. That would be a huge selling point for new people to join the club. A long shot but worth it.For outdoors we go every other weekend. The rides are arranged during a club meeting and are mostly provided by members of the club. The admins of the club tag along the trip bouldering or sport and everything is pretty much agreed upon by the group. We use the dues for  or  big trips to popular climbing spots.

Anyways there was a day when most of the other campers were already paired up and I really wanted to climb a wall that had been giving me trouble all summer. Going against my better judgement I asked a less then reputable camper to belay me. My first inkling that I had made a horrible decision came when I slipped the first time and ended up back on the ground. I wasnt too far up at the time though so I just made it very clear to him that he needed to take in slack and got back on the wall. In retrospect not my smartest moment. Anyways I get about  feet up a  foot wall went to make a risky move and I slipped. It didnt take me long to realize that he wasnt going to catch me. It was possibly the scariest moment of my life.

After I thought about the hexes I wonder if one of the newbies just accidentally pulled and clipped the hex sling from the wrong side. Meaning perhaps they were set up correctly initially  but they got a little loose in the pack and a newbie took it out and clipped the sling from the wrong side unknowingly. You can actually see a bend in the sling where it would normally sit in its correct position.

Also by the time you get there they will have most likely determined the nesting sites for the falcons and will have opened everything except the specific climbs in the area directly around the nests.  You just have to keep an eye on the park service website for any announcements around that time.There is a lot of rock in Zion that is not affected by the closures.  I wouldnt be too too worried about it unless you have your eyes really set on a specific climb.edit  I just looked through Mountain Project and all of the closed area are direct links off the main zion page except for Cable Mountain Tunnel Wall and Middle Fork Taylor Creek.  Cable Mountain doesnt really have any climbing on it as far as I can tell which isnt going to be seriously adventurous.  The Tunnel Wall is on Mountain Project as Mount Carmel Tunnel this would probably be the biggest bummer if it ended up being closed but I think by the time you are there they will have picked out only a small section of it to be closed if its closed at all.  And the Middle Fork of Taylor Creek is in Kolob Canyon which is a different area than the main park.  Just get a list of routes going and then stop in to the ranger station when you get there and they will be able to tell you which if any of them are affected by the closure.

Im a climber I like climbing I understand that everyone makes their own decisions on where the risk becomes too much risk and Im totally cool with that.  But just because someone else really enjoys a very dangerous activity doesnt mean  Im going to pretend to see extra virtue in the act of climbing without a rope.  It makes for cooler pictures and shows a willingness to accept huge and uncontrollable risk factors thats about all I can say for it.

Theyve already dumped the money into the testing and designs to create the line.So like any good investor would want to see is the actual product.  My guess is that they are needing the upfront money they put down for a manufacturer to begin the process.  Or they need the money as a downpayment to secure the MUCH larger amount they need to startup the manufacturing process.Either way theyve stopped the testing process so its the last step.So no kickstarter has an loose policy and does payout the money but theyve built a trusted brand and thats why people give.Hopefully that helps give you some clarity.EDIT Sorry I englished that so bad.

To answer your question yes you could probably get away with a more aggressive shoe but youll be sacrificing a degree of comfort for it also smearing doesnt work as well.

7128563,0,t1_d1oals2,I was going to chime in but these are basically my feelings too.B Top of P turned into a mess quickly. Most of the issues revolved around two things insufficient safety and clutter caused by too much going on at the top bolt. For the safety issue you went in direct on a single bolt  points in a  point anchor system. The other issue was the amount of stuff going on at that top bolt. I will give recommendations to fix this at the end.B Much safer at the top of P. Everything technically OK IMO.B Again a couple safety issues. You went in direct using a non locking carabiner to a single bolt before removing your tether. Not so important here since you were on  bolts  but if you were on  trad pieces it would be a bigger deal the sling from the outer two bolts just went through the masterpoint no knot below the middle biner. If one failed the other would not have been attached to the masterpoint. Bascially that anchor was only worth  bolts  points when it could have been .B Safe but cluttered.I too would suggest that you stop using a tether and locking biner as your direct line. I used to use  dynema tethers and do something similar still do for cleaning single pitch sport but when I learned about using the rope to do in direct it really cleaned up my belay stations. When you use the rope to do in direct you eliminate clutter and create a way to quickly adjust the length of your tether.My second suggestion would be to bring that master point off of the wall. I typically make anchors using cordelette or runners. First I hang biners on all of my pieces. Then I clip every piece into the cordrunner loop. Then I pull down the slack. After that I tie a big fat safeasfuck figure  at the bottom. Go in direct on the master using a clove hitch. I like to belay off my harness but sometimes this might not be ideal so alternatively you can use a directional or belay off the master point.,climbing,d1ofqty,3,t5_2qk72

If you dont have a PAS then you need a second sling.What I learned to do was a little different than his method.  I clip the end of the PAS into the bolt and then I clip an extra draw into the other bolt and clip it to whatever loop in the PAS makes it so I can weight both anchor bolts.I like this better than his method since it is equalized and doesnt require an extra biner you should have an extra draw anyways or your can clip to one of the anchor draws but his method is fine too.I also use my PAS to extend my rappel so dont mind that it cost marginally more than  slings and  lockers.  ,climbing,d36u9fq,4,t5_2qk72

From this formula you can see that given a small enough time to decelerate even a small mass can produce an arbitrarily large force. division by  gives big numbersThis is how theoretically a very small fall on a very rigid anchor i dont have any idea how rigid a sling really is could produce a force large enough to break a biner.Again this is the theory you would need actual numbers to evaluate whether a  foot fall can produce a kN load.,climbing,d4c9276,6,t5_2qk72

I know you said you play cello etc. but if someone with a lifetime of experience loading the connective tissue in his hands as a musician myself I can assure you that when playing youre not loading those ligaments and tendons anywhere near the same amount is doing a lower load than you then you should probably back off.

The UIAA fall rating is the number of . factor falls a rope can take in a row without failing.  These are pretty unrealistic real world tests  counting falls on a rope just isnt a useful tactic compared to diligently inspecting it. Not only is the factor far more extreme than what normally happens it can only happen on a multipitch climb but the fact that the falls are all in a short period makes a large difference too.  Dynamic ropes do stretch out with falls and require some recovery time to ensure they properly lower the impact force.  ,climbing,d5m6ttj,2,t5_2qk72

Thats also one of the reasons many old school climbs were so sandbaggedit was a huge insult to have another climber come and downgrade your route so you see some of old school .s that are just as hard as modern .s.

8814547,0,t3_50t9nf,this past february I took a huge trad fall and ended up with a grade  ankle sprain  tore  ligaments. For me and for others who have been injured after everything has recovered the mental strength was the last thing to return. When I first tried leading it was terrifying I hated it and feared I may not ever return to leading at my limit. But it did eventually come back. So just be patient and give it time. What I would recommend is to continue top roping. It took me  months to start leading again and even then I took it slow.  At this point DO NOT go bouldering. The fear you have of falling at this point is rational and the danger is real. One weird fall and your ankle is toast and youre back where you started. So dont rush it. Youll know when its time to send again and over time youll be able to take on bigger challenges and risks. Also if you havent going to walgreens and picking up a compression sleeve is not a bad idea. you can get one thats thin enough to fit inside a climbing shoe that will provide some stabilization while climbing. But also it helps to just bring one with you so as soon as your finished climbing for the day throw it on and it will instantly kill any swelling which is huge helped a lot for me.anyways just be patient be positive and give it time. youll be back before you know it. ,climbing,d77e00w,2,t5_2qk72

Im not gonna flame you I understand where people in these comments are coming from but if this is used for instruction then the people teaching with it are going to know that this setup alone doesnt prepare someone to go lead  pitches tomorrow.  Theyll use this as a stepping stone.  I think its really interesting seeing that adjustable rig for the cams and I like the idea of letting a newer climber actually take a fall on a cam in a super controlled environment. Then they can see how the cam acts when catching a fall and get over some of that fear.quick story  Ive been climbing for  years and trad the last . Last year I had the chance to take a seasonlong course in trad climbing and rescue and learned a ton.  While mock leading trad early on in the course we went to seacliffs in Acadia National Park.  The sea cliffs are full of cracks and easy to climb and find placements in but the rock quality is also terrible.  Everything sounds hollow and the climbing is methodical as you test every big hold. We knew we werent going to actually do away with the top ropes there but we still got value out of having to analyze gear placements along an entire pitch of climbing. ,climbing,d81v10j,4,t5_2qk72

Compared to what you already own not too expensive.Be prepared to have to climb a route for hours when learning helps to learn solo belay techniques so as to not bore your partner. And of course when you get good at it it still may take hours to complete a difficult route!

9132956,0,t1_d88ylef,gt How do I care for my shoes? Am I supposed to wear them without socks?Seems most people wear them without sox  except some old trad dads. Sox will help prevent shoe stank but will feel less precise. I have one pair of shoes that are looser than the others so I sometimes start off with sox on long trad routes. As the day goes on and my feet swell I put the sox in my pocket.gtWhat should I do after I take them off?Stank is caused by bacteria and bacteria love warm and moist. So open them up and let them dry out. Dont store them in your trunk or backpack. I spay inside mine with a little rubbing alcohol or Lysol.Having more than one pair allows for drying time between sessions.Rubber oxidizes and hardens over time. A nice stiff nylon nail or vegetable brush will help the soles. Big box stores have nylon brushes for use with paint stripper. These are cheap lt  and work really well.Surprising another thing that works really well for removing oxidation is a soft cloth and a dab of Turtle Wax Bug and Tar Remover from an automotive store. I dont know where I read this but it works amazingly well. Just a dab though.Delamination can be repaired with Weldwood Contact Cement or Barge Cement. Make sure its original and not Toluene Free. Clean both sides of the delaminated rubber well and apply a light coat to both. Let it completely dry. Warm it over an electric stove burner until the glue softens and then press together and clamp. Extra points if you dont burn your fingers.Lastly send your shoes out for resole before you start to wear into the rand. Its better to resole sooner rather than later.,climbing,d89o24u,4,t5_2qk72

9257683,0,t3_5770rm,its pretty common to have different sized feet. Some climbing shoe companies will sell you two different sized shoes which can help. I have never heard of foot tendinitis but maybe im just ignorant. What I do know is that most climbing shoe companies advocate against getting painful shoes and just recommend tight fitting shoes that your foot doesnt move in. Be aware that different shoes are based on different lasts which is what they call a specific foot shape. You might not fit into certain types perfectly but when you find the right shoe you will want to try to find similar lasts as you replace shoes that are worn out. I would recommend you go to a shoe dealer like REI for example and try on a bunch of different pairs to decide which ones actually fit you well and arent painful. ,climbing,d8ph7y5,3,t5_2qk72

9326990,0,t3_581u03,As someone who is currently developing routes your first action needs to be find and gain permission from the land owner.  You need a good working knowledge of the sportsmen liability for your area meaning if you fall and get hurt on private land how easy is it to sue the owner.If it is public land seek advice from your local climbing advocacy group as to the laws in place concerning new trail creation or eventually bolting. There are tons of small pocket areas around the United States that have bolts on them that are rusting away because people got excited and started developing without permission and locals got scared thinking everyone that climbs ends up dying.   Remember that every time you say climb they hear liability.  In much of the US climbing is technically viewed as vertical hiking in parks meaning that it is a just as legitimate of an activity as hiking unless the geological features youd be on are in some way protected meaning rare rock formations archeological sites research areas.  I dont know about BC though.  I know of several sites ive wanted to develop that after doing research on the place I found out that it is protected because of rare plants or as a geological conservancy area.  You might be surprised how often rare mosses fall into this category.I would repeat the make a good trail before everyone makes their own sentiment.   Dont tell a bunch of people either only people you trust and who have the best interest of the climbing community and a healthy respect for the environment will really be allies to you.  Youd be surprised how many cowboy bolters there are.  Say you begin to develop a good relationship with the land owner and you and heher walk out to the area so you can show her how respectful you have been to their land only to find that some loser with a drill has poorly bolted a line down the middle of a great trad line and left cigarette butts around the base.  This kind of stuff happens more than youd think.  More than once ive had to rap down a new line some guy put up a route that is  with  bolts on it and loose rock everywhere.  People want their names in books dont doubt it.My general philosophy is as little disruption of the environment as possible.  Having said that good belay stances are key to minimizing erosion and spreading climbing trails too far from the cliff line. I use hand brushes from the hardware store with plastic bristles because wire brushes can harm some rock and leave ugly marks.One parting note..    if your region is anything like mine the place has probably been climbed before and there are some old timers with knowledge of it.  Ask around.   Dont be shocked if it has an old piton someplace.  ,climbing,d8y9j77,2,t5_2qk72

You cant put power down on easier problems and expect to just pull your way up them like you can on the v jug hauls in the gym outdoors and that can be an ego killer for some. You are most definitely lacking the fundamentals and the positive holds of gym problems are allowing you to ignore them. The SelfCoached Climber by Dan Hague is an excellent book if you want to learn about the fundamentals of balance and movement  I wish I bought it years ago.Dont be discouraged because you will unlock the nature of outdoor climbing in time with practice and experimentation.

9990024,0,t3_5io9hw,I have a few training and injuryprevention questions.I want to get somewhat more serious about my climbing but Im not sure yet how to go about it. Ive been climbing for a bit more than  years. Im still struggling with b leading indoors though it seems that Im getting there.The Making of a Rockprodigy seems like an interesting training plan but in reality it looks rather hard to implement for me especially because of the long ARC phase at the beginning. As I dont have a very big circle of climbing friends living nearby and dont want to antagonise the ones I have by forcing them to follow my training schedule I wonder if its viable to just roughly follow that guide but skip some of these trainings for regular gym or outdoor climbing?If not are there other more easily implementable training schedules around? Or are there any good books? Ive considered ordering the Rock Climbers Training Manual from the same people who wrote the above article but shipping it to Europe is just ridiculously expensive. Recently I also skipped through The SelfCoached Climber but didnt find it very helpful at all.Furthermore can someone point me to workouts that are good to do before or after climbing or on off days? Im mainly aiming at injury prevention and soretense muscles here. Sometimes I do have pains in fingers wrists and elbows and Im very paranoid about serious injury there so anything that helps in preventing those would be helpful. I also do have some upper back  shoulder tensions which Im not sure about if they are climbing related or office work related...Any help is highly appreciated!,climbing,db9q7j5,1,t5_2qk72

9999702,0,t1_dbap3ne,. Started by having Lowes rip and crosscut a  plywood for me. The dimensions are x.. Use xs to frame the wall double check all your measurements. The original cuts in the plywood werent perfect and framing should match to save yourself time.. After you have the plywood attached to the frame... SAND! My wife was terrified of splinters so I probably over sanded.. Once you decide on how steep you want the wall our top is off the ground use geometry to figure out the angle of elevation. Set your mitre saw to that angle and cut additional xs for the legs. . Bolt the legs to the frame on the interior so your angled cut sits against the underside of the climbing wall. I used  bolts.. I took the legs back off to attach the holds I just spaced them out with no rhyme or reason. Make sure if you want to paint the surface you do it first. Id suggest not installing the Tnuts until after youve painted.That was a quick writeup but it basically covers it. We just kind of dove in and did it....,climbing,dbazn8n,7,t5_2qk72

10394498,0,t3_5oux5f,I look at the problem like this Tight Shoes gt Comfy Shoes gt No Shoes.I work as an instructor at a climbing gym a couple of hours a week and I always tell people who are new to the sport that their shoes will not be the limiting factor in their climbing for quite a while from when they start climbing. Knowing this I can recommend them to get a pair of comfortable climbing shoes still with good rubber and a pointy toe that they will actually want to use. It will be better than climbing barefoot or in sneakers but maybe not give them the last  needed to send a . crag.Sure there might come a day when your shoes are so big you find yourself slipping because you cannot edge well enough. However when that day comes you are probably motivated enough to take the pain that comes with small shoes. I wear my Solutions one size smaller than my normal shoe size. It takes  sessions to break them in and if its cold or I havent used them for a couple of days they are not very pleasant. Ill take them of on my way down the wall or as soon as I am done bouldering  but they give the last  to do the moves a pair of Tarantula could not. TLDRGet a pair of comfortable climbing shoes. If they are tight enough that you dread them you wont use them and that is worse than comfy shoes. Only get uncomfy shoes when you feel that your current shoes are letting you down.,climbing,dcma6xr,8,t5_2qk72

10405547,0,t3_5p0efc,Yes beginner shoes for too long leads to bad footwork because they generally have imprecise toes and less concentrated power at the tip. This leads to poor habits. Also increased sensitivity lets you feel subtle changes in the rockhold and lets you feel the optimal placement much more intuitively or at all. A sensitive softer shoe generally conforms better to the holds as well leading to more contact area and better friction. ,climbing,dcnjb5f,6,t5_2qk72

Even though they are La Sporitiva there is a huge difference in the last shape between the Mythos and the Muira. If they feel too tight in the front and too loose in the heel I would suggest trying out some other shoes.  It sounds like the heel in the Muria is too deep for you. In my experience the shaman has similar performance characteristics with a wider toe box and narrower shallow heel. You could also try something like the Scarpa booster s which is a little less asymmetric and again wider in the toes. If this is your first pair of more performance oriented climbing shoes I would suggest trying on every single pair you possible can. The fit of a shoe is way more important than the hype surrounding them.  ,climbing,dd6uiyr,2,t5_2qk72

The chapel pond crags are nice one or two pitch areas and you can jump in the pond afterwards. For single pitching cragging Montagne DArgent and Montagne du Tranchant are fun and filled with nice moderates. Val David the birth place of Quebecois climbing will keep you busy for a while too. Good bouldering there too.If you want to sport climb Tranchant is still good. Rigaud is so so but its maybe an hour from the city so convenient but can be busy. Weir has some solid hard lines. So does lac boisseau. Kamouraska is a bit of a drive but I heard its absolutely awesome. Rumney too is a very reasonable weekend trip.Basically youre close to some of the best climbing in the Northeast USA and tons of hidden gems in Quebec.As far as gyns and a culture its strong. There are something like  gyms in the area with Allez Up and Bloc shop being the best downtown. Beta Bloc on the west island is rad. Canyon on the south shore is also supposed to be good.

11450497,0,t1_dfsq2a5,Been climbing for  years and rock an old D for my chalk bag connection. It has come in handy when Im stretching a pitch and out of draws and racking carabiners. Among my friends a chalk bag on cord is the sign of a gym climber or boulderer a clear not a trad climber symbol. To all the people talking about breaking your tail bone with one. Please link to a few examples of this. When I rack up I have a ton of metal hanging off of me. I could do all sorts of damage if I landed on a cam got a sling hooked and strangled myself etc... This only seems to be a worry among beginners and sport climbers. ,climbing,dftwkr0,2,t5_2qk72

11467954,0,t3_63kbw4,I think a good question to ask yourself is what story is your photo sharing? The location where you took the shot offers an opportunity to have a more intimate focus on the climber where her emotions are apparent. She is obviously quite comfortable and confident so perhaps capturing her in the middle of a move might demonstrate her composure better by contrasting it with something that may be testing it.Alternately by moving further out from the wall you could focus on the journey  either capturing where she has been or ideally where she is going in the frame neither of which are really present in this shot.Generally when you have a sense of what the narrative is you can use other techniques to emphasize it. Shooting from above and want to strengthen the sense of vertigo? Try using a wideangle lens to stretch the background further into distance. Maybe use a wider aperture to draw focus to a particular part of the photo. Lengthen the exposure slightly and pan the camera when capture a move to convey some of that motion. There are tonnes of options but without a sense of what you are communicating in the photo the effect may be lost.You have chosen an angle that lets us see the climbers face and gauge her emotion confident calm composed. You have chosen a particular moment when her attention is on the draw. This along with the narrower depth of field draws the viewers attention to the draw as well. Why is she looking at the draw? Is she worried she wont make the clip? She does seem to be clipping rather low at first glance the comfy ledge isnt immediately apparent perhaps shes anxious and desperate to reach the next draw? The story in the moment you captured seems to contradict the story on her face. Technically I feel the photo is well done but I think it is somewhat weaker because of this confusing or incomplete narrative.,climbing,dfvvx3z,2,t5_2qk72
11476000,0,t1_dfwgfce,Thanks! I havent thought of the  draws that way but it makes sense. I have a follow up question. The anchors I have seen people built with quickdraws were built with draws with short dogbones ie what they had. These anchors looked like there was as much side ways force as downward force on the bolts. In contrast anchors made with slings and cordettes seem to dangle further from the bolts and have more downward force. I guess the bolt is identical on all sides so it shouldnt matter?,climbing,dfwstk7,2,t5_2qk72

Try to hold on for as long as you can. This will only go so far unless you can add weight weight vest or other added weights.Not sure how much money you have to spend on plate weights or other materials. But what you can do is get some small  x  blocks and screw them together. Secure an eye hook to the pinch block. Get some plate weights a small length of chain and a carabiner. Loop the chain through the plate hole and eye hook. Put the carabiner through each end of the chain to secure the weight to the pinch block. For an example of the pinch block you would make You could also look up exercises called nohangs.  Those are fun.   Im sure there are other ways to train your pinch grip.  Keep researching for different exercises.  Overall climbing ,climbing,dgp36jy,3,t5_2qk72

11755947,0,t1_dgsiwa5,So to join the gym you have to check off forms saying that you know how to top rope and lead? What happens if you dont know how to toprope or lead? I doubt that theyre going to tuen you away just because you dont know how. I assume theyd offer classes to teach people how to top rope and lead. Do the gyms not have belay tests to verify that you indeed do know how to top rope and lead safely? Do they really just take you at your word? Also like I mentioned the harder lead routes at my gym are all .b and above there are a few top rope routes that are leadable in the ..c range. Whats the point of teaching people how to lead at a . level if they wont be able do any of the lead routes anyways? I suppose it would be posisble to make more of the easier routes leadable but I suspect that part of the reason they have the lead test on the overhanging wall is that its safer to fall on an overhang than it would be a verticleslab wall where youd be more likely to hit the wall and injure yourself if you fall. And most newbies have difficulty on large overhangs. At my gym taking the lead test is free. If you want to take the lead classes they offer theyre  each for members Lead I and Lead II but its not required that you take them. But as I mentioned in my previous comment you arent allowed to practice actual lead climbing until you get your lead belay card. You can only mock lead before then. ,climbing,dgske5z,1,t5_2qk72
