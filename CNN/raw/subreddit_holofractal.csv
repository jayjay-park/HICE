2459899,0,t1_cmevcea,So you have watched the Primer Fields then? While the Primer Fields mostly discusses the implications of a dual torus structure of energy and its affect on matter using a vacuum chamber and magnetic bowls I think the dual torus field described in Primer Fields is a direct result of the theory on the structure of matter and the inout flow of energy in relationship with the singularity presented in Nassims theory. Either way in part  of The Primer Fields he discusses the dual slit experiment and has a fantastic and interesting approach to the behavior of light. I think with more study in this area we could come up with some new theories on the behavior of light and try to prove or disprove aspects of the theory... And this would certainly have real world applications. lasers pew pew! ,holofractal,cmfqucc,1,t5_33j70

4942863,0,t3_3ikidk,Awesome.So this is very close to what Nassims model is  however there is a definite major change. In Hawkings model hawking radiation leaks out very slowly across the boundary particle  antiparticle creation at the event horizonHowever in Nassims model  black holes are linked through space Schwarzchild wormholes via the planck spherical unit lattice.In this way black holes arent only storing information of their own volume on their surface they are all sharing information  like fractal networked hubs. Its essentially the internet if each PC had a local copy of the entire internet that was updated instantly with changes. Here is some research on tiny black holes and hawking radiation and how there might be a period in which hawking radiation would cease to exist. Many of these result find values extremely similar to Nassims Schwarzchild proton with a mass of  grams.The Hadron Barrier in Cosmology and Gravitational Collapse Switching off the blackhole evaporation Il Nuovo Cimento B V  Number  April  | Summary We study energetics both in a classical and in a quantum framework in the solution of Einstein equations for unified gravitational and electromagnetic field. We find that with certain values of the parameters of the metric the black hole stops evaporating and settles down to a stable configuration. Possible extensions to hadron physics are also considered.  |Therefore there is evidence that a hadron barrier exists for Hawking radiation and I cannot emphasize enough how important these findings are as they came through completely different approaches to produce similar results.Another approach that offers stability of nuclear particlesized black holes comes from considering reflections near the horizon limiting Hawking radiation. This approach was taken by Funkhouser. Thermodynamic reflection of particles by Schwarzschild black holes | Abstract The change in the entropy caused by the quasistatic absorption of a particle of energy  by a Schwarzschild black hole ScBH is approximately Ts where T is the Hawking temperature of the black hole and s is the entropy of the particle. A violation of the generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics would occur if Tsamplt and it is plausible that particles approaching the event horizon of a ScBH may be reflected thermodynamically in some instances. The reflection probability is obtained from the standard relationship between the number of microscopic complexions and entropy. If Tampgtampgt and if s is negligible then the new probability function is consistent with an independent expression following from a detailed treatment of quantum particles in a Schwarzschild metric giving the probability for an event horizon to reflect an incident particle. The manifestation of wavelike behaviors in the new probability function intimates perhaps a fundamental physical unity. |What is the minimum size black hole that can accrete a particle? approach Result Surprise!  to  grams!Scott Funkhouser The minimum mass of a black hole that is capable of accreting a particle If a black hole should absorb a fundamental particle then the number of bits registered by the black hole must increase by at least one. It follows that the minimum mass of a Schwarzschild black hole that is capable of absorbing a massive particle is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle. That stipulation is identical to the limit obtained by applying Landauers Principle to the accretion of a particle with the temperature of the black hole given by its effective Hawking radiation temperature. The minimum Schwarzschild mass necessary for the accretion of nucleons is of the order kg. Since the minimum mass necessary for accreting electrons is roughly three orders of magnitude larger than the minimum mass necessary for the accretion of protons it is conceivable that certain black holes could accumulate electrical charge. |Interestingly Funkhouser also concludes that the minimum size of a black hole capable of accreting a particle is about gr which is large enough to accrete a nucleon such as a proton and must be larger still about gr  in order to accrete an electron.So yet again we see another analysis from a different point of view has come to the same minimum mass for a black hole which approximates the size of our Schwarzschild proton. The references above suggest several mechanisms by which such nucleonsized black holes may achieve stability in the face of Hawking radiation.The Minimum Black Hole Size and the Holographic PrincipleOne of the important conjectures guiding research into the entropy and information content of systems like black holes is called the holographic principle. Basically it states that the entropy or information content of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon. This implies that for example since the universe as a whole meets the Schwarzschild condition that the total information entropy of the universe is proportional to the area of the sphere enclosing it and contains some  bits of information.Since the surface of a sphere goes up as the square of the radius whereas the volume goes up as the cube of the radius there is much less area than volume to the universe. Therefore according to the holographic principle only a few of the possible states in the universal volume can exist. This suggests that the universe exists in a state space that is only sparsely populated.One consequence of this is that the minimum quantization size of spacetime must be larger than for example the Planck length. This minimum quantization length is what Funkhouser refers to above as the holographic length.Interestingly Funkhouser concludes that the holographic length is about the diameter of a nucleon and that the fundamental volume derived from this will have the mass of a black hole of  to  grams! Which again just happens to be the calculated size for the Schwarzchild Proton. Q.E.D.A fundamental scale of mass for black holes from the cosmological constant The existence of a positive cosmological constant leads naturally to two fundamental scales of length being the De Sitter horizon and the radius of the cell associated with a holographic degree of freedom. Associated with each of those scales of length are a macroscopic gravitational mass and a microscopic quantum mechanical mass. Three of those four fundamental masses have been discussed in the literature and this present work identifies the physical significance of the remaining mass being the gravitational mass associated with the holographic length. That mass which is of the order kg and inversely proportional to the sixth root of the cosmological constant represents the mass of the black hole whose evaporation time is equal to the fundamental cosmic time which is of the order the current age of the universe. It also represents the minimum mass of a black hole that is capable of accreting a particle whose Compton wavelength is equal to the fundamental holographic length which is of the order the Compton wavelength of the nucleon.|,holofractal,cuhl5ir,6,t5_33j70

6060947,0,t1_cye1cnj,If the vortex model was simply attempting to add to the standard REPRESENTATION of the heliocentric model which we both agree is flawed this would be a minor issue. The animation would still be inaccurate but negligibly so. One of the biggest issues with this animation however is that the creator of it uses it to try and suggest that the heliocentric model of the solar system is wrong and the vortex model is correct. This claim is totally inaccurate. The planets do orbit the sun heliocentrically. The inaccuracies present in this animation are not accidental or due to oversimplifications rather they rest on fundamental misunderstandings. The flaws arent a product of the animations inability to represent whats actually going on. Rather the animation purposefully misrepresents the interaction of the planets and sun in order to guide the authors conclusion that the heliocentric theory is incorrect. I think that you believe that the author is only trying to suggest that the standard representation of the heliocentric theory the one we are all familiar with that kids are taught in school is wrong and that this is a more accurate rendition of that theory. This claim wouldnt be so bad since i think that the animation on its own has its merits showing that the sun moves as well.That is not what Sadhu is attempting to do with this animation. He is literally trying to suggest that the heliocentric theory is wrong and ought to be replaced with his theory of vortex movement. Unfortunately the vortex model is not accurate. So if the animation was merely an attempt to correct some misconceptions regarding the standard representation of the heliocentric model then its inaccuracies could be overlooked. But since the author purposefully created the animation with inaccuracies in order to try and undermine the heliocentric theory in an attempt to replace it with his own theory which operates in a manner that goes against our best scientific observations then the appropriate response is simply that the animation is wrong and so is the theory that it is suggesting that we replace the heliocentric theory with. ,holofractal,cye320y,3,t5_33j70

7456685,0,t1_d2pp67l,Im still trying to wrap my head around this but can it be thought of this way trying to bridge the gap to regular particle physics?EM waves with wavelength below the Planck length very high frequency supposedly do not exist because they cannot affect matter according the conventional narrative.But we know from QM that the behavior of particles is indeterminate that systems can reduce to varied outcomes supposedly randomly. This indeterminacy is the only place where conventional physics allows for the possibility of mind and will as separate from physical reality the way I see it.If there is something which determines which states systems reduce to that something is choice. But is this choice arbitrary and random? No in our own experience it is based upon factors such as gut feelings sensory information and logic. It is in some way a calculation based upon inputs.So if these high frequency subplanck wavelength waves exist the only way they can affect physical reality given that the experiments prove they dont have any conventional effect is through this mechanism  the information in these waves can be detected by consciousness and inform the decisions of that consciousness.So plants decide to grow differently when placed in a certain locations etc.,holofractal,d2ps0u4,1,t5_33j70
8093981,0,t1_d4ptqoh,Ok let me try and break it down Start with the planck unit  we have natural measurements for the planck length and the planck mass.Nassim turns this into a spherical harmonic oscillator planck length diameter sphere with the planck mass energy.Simply divide the proton volume by the PSU volume and you get  PSUs that fit in the proton volume. Since we are dividing one sphere by another there are no gaps  it is all spacefilling.  planck mass spheres fit.  the planck mass energy of a single PSU yields the holographic mass of  grams.So the amount of planck energies that fit in the proton is  grams commonly given as the mass of the observable Universe.The next step to see how much of this actually exhibits mass locally the proton rest mass is to divide the surface PSUs by the volume PSUs.So the surface fits about  PSUs and the volume . Divide the surface by the volume and multiply planck mass to yield  grams the rest mass of the proton.This is because you can think of the surface PSUs as beginnings of a wormhole extending to another proton  this transfers a piece of the  grams through space to another proton ergo it doesnt contribute to the rest mass of the proton. This is because of the holographic principle which simply states the surface of a black hole can encode the volume of a black hole so thats why we divide the surface by the volume to see how much volume mass the surface port is representing.When the  grams is divided into all the surface ports you get  left of the PSUs to contribute mass locally which multiplied  the planck mass is the rest mass of the proton. ,holofractal,d4pu49n,2,t5_33j70
8100020,0,t1_d4pu49n,OK I think I follow you now thanks heaps!So the proton basically has two expressions of mass  the holographic mass and the rest mass  so the standard mass isnt wrong as such its just half the story they are only measuring the local mass expressed on the event horizon not the holographic mass because they never bothered to include the PSU vaccum energy in the volume... so since Nassim includes the holographic mass and uses it to get a rest mass his rest mass is likely more accurate. He then used this more accurate mass to derive a more accurate charge radius and made a prediction based on this.... something like that?The only part Im not sure about now is why you multiply  x the planck mass.... why  times? This is probably some basic algebraic thing that I just dont understand...This is the kind of depth I found lacking from the delegate course TBH....it was good but they can only include so much I suppose and the community chalkboard is rather desolate I found...I kinda wish they had of included much more of this kind of breakdown of the juicy parts of theory for us layman and maybe not bothered so much with all the stuff about the Ark of the Covenant and Pyramids etc..... its all interesting and it is related but I feel its more supplementary and couldve just been offered as such and given more time to the actual Unified Theory itself....most of the info on Ancient Civilizations etc can already be found whereas Nassims theory cannot....anyway just a rant..... lolIm infinitely grateful for this help guys!

While you can speculate that we cant see this effect due to our incomplete image of the proton what you cant speculate is that we wouldnt detect this through the energy required to move a proton.This further explanation doesnt even matter since as stated the proton doesnt really have a surface to assume so ignores all observations and experimentation done for decades for absolutely no reason other than to produce a result by mashing together constants to achieve nearmeasured values.

This is not the holographic you may be used to in this case the word means holos whole graphic image  the whole picture or information is available at every point.This differs from the dsurface hologram in that it is each and every proton that contains the information of all protons holographically. This is not abstract  we are talking literally in terms of quantum vacuum fluctuations.The planck unit is a fundamental unit not defined by humans. It has a length a mass and a time  representing a wave fluctuation or oscillationYou can think of this as the absolute smallest electromagnetic fluctuation or universe does the smallest oscillation of light. It is extremely tiny and extremely energetic.By sphericalizing this unit  we can then show the proton is holographic and contains the information of all other protons inside of each proton.By dividing the proton volume by a planck spherical unit volume and multiplying by the planck mass we yield the mass of the observable Universe at  grams  the mass of all protons holographically represented in each proton.We can then apply the holographic principle by dividing surface planck  units by volume and multiplying by planck mass to get the mass of a single protonThis solution is justified through the use of microwormholes each planck spherical unit being the termination of a micro wormhole that connects all protons together instantaneously through quantum entanglement.,holofractal,dd8ezj9,2,t5_33j70
