238634,0,t1_cf50b43,I guess all I can say is he never appears to not have a plan. Hes extremely prepared and never asks for anything that he doesnt need. Hes also not against adjusting a light or bounce himself which his gaffer and key grip already acknowledge even if they dont like it. Hes a really kind person and discussed how he lit and shot a handful of his movies just because I asked questions. He surrounds himself with talented people who are just as gracious as he is. Nothing surprises him and he seems to always be striving for perfection but he understands that performances are the only truly important thing. With that said we were shooting a night exterior and he stood up from his chair where he was operating the remote head and told his gaffer that  of his  or so tweenies were dead. Literally no one else noticed. So story is first and foremost for him but he knows when he can nitpick. In summation plan every detail so that when the unexpected does arise you are able to improvise without guessing about anything. Communication with your director is also incredibly important.,cinematography,cf5hh84,5,t5_2ri38

Ive done the mistake of buying a couple. They wernt enough to fulfil the shoots requirements agreed you could rent it out too but its cheaper for a production house to rent from one place with whom they have a tieup for for good rates.I only used them on documentaries and short films for friends. Nobody will come to rent  lights from you and the rest from a rental house.If you need them to practice then you shouldnt be buying them in the first place its too early.

1132828,0,t1_chr89w5,I know this post is  days old but I thought Id chime in.When youre far away and zoomed in perspective is more compressed. So when you do the tracking move things look like they are whizzing by because they are much larger in relation to the subject. We dont really get a sense of the space around the subject so it feels claustrophobic and like the whole world is spinning.If we did this up close with a wide angle lens perspective would be more stretched out and open feeling. The background would be smaller so we would be more aware of the space. This would feel less claustrophobic ruining the effect.It should be noted that since you need a good amount of distance between you and your subject you also need a good amount of distance between your subject and background to keep things whizzing by during the move. If you think of your subject as the rotational axis of your camerasubjectbackground system then it should be easy to imagine what the background speeds will be like. Its like how the tips of a fans blades are actually moving faster linear speed not rotational speed then the parts closer to the center axis. This can be seen in the Bad Boys gif where Will Smith is barely revolving around Martin Lawrence while the background is spinning much faster.,cinematography,chx1wmb,1,t5_2ri38

2398415,0,t3_2mvbgu,Warning self plug I write for dvinfo.net and provideocoalition.com and Ive posted such things in both places.Its tough though there are very few DPs who can actually communicate whats going through their heads when they create a look. We are a notoriously incoherent and rightbrain bunch. Its very frustrating to me as Im still dissecting shots from movies and TV to figure out whats going on and its very difficult sometimes. I love Emmanuel Lubezkis work for example but its often hard to tell where the hell the light is coming from. Its almost invisible. Im getting better at this myself but hes the master.Its also been frustrating on the few occasions where Ive shot second unit for other DPs I cant get any really good information out of them other than match my look heres a list of gels good luck. The first feature I did this on called American Yakuza turned out spectacularly wellthe first unit DP told me later he couldnt remember what hed shot vs. what Id shotbut Im not sure how I did that other than we naturally had similar styles. I shot second unit on a car spot a while back without really being told I was going to be shooting second unit I was hired as an operator and suddenly Im off on my own shooting cars without having done it before! and the only direction the DP gave me was after Id shot something hed look at playback and say Oh no no no. Thats not right. Okay well... why couldnt you have told me that in advance? Because he simply couldnt he could light for his camera but he couldnt tell anyone else how he did what he did.Its crazy difficult to get DPs to tell others what their thought process is. Go look at Roger Deakins forum rogerdeakins.com great DP very generous but even he doesnt go into much detail about what he does. He just knows how to do it he cant necessarily explain how he decides to do it that way.Someone mentioned Alex Buono. He writes great stuff. His blog is definitely worth looking at. I havent look at Shane Hurlbuts site in a while but hes a pretty good explainer too.A lot of what they talk about though is cameras and framing and such. Its still hard for them to talk about light quality of light lighting strategies etc. I just picked up an updated copy of Kris Malkiewicz Film Lighting book as hes got new interviews with people like M. David Mullen ASC great guy and great teacher plus old ones with awesome gaffers like James Plannette. Theres some gold in there even for those of us who have been doing this for a while.The thing is... Ive been in the business for  years and shooting almost exclusively for ... which means I only really saw how other DPs worked for about five years. I learned a ton but theres so much more and Ive just had to figure the rest out for myself. Its hugely valuable to work with professional crews and see how they do things.

2565738,0,t1_cmsws1t,That is a very complex question how many years do you have to study?The pitch size is still big enough to get a phenomenal number of photons so the sampled value is close. Then they use a high precision analog amplifier and a sense node that is bigger and more accurate then normal. These make the measurement more accurate.The second thing they do is in the debayering process. Red appears to use a wavelet debayering process. This takes care of some of the inaccuracy by assuming the values are not exactly correct using data from surrounding samples to reduce the error more. There is a valid debate on the validity of this. There is an inevitable drift from accurate colors but at the same time the wavelets match the human eye perception very well. ,cinematography,cmthb3l,1,t5_2ri38
2574215,0,t1_cmsws1t,With REDs new Dragon sensor the sensor is physically larger than the one previous to it. The low light capability of the Dragon sensor wasnt as good right off the bat compared to the one before. They may have been able to retain a similar pixel pitch but with the sensor being larger many cinema lenses cannot resolve the edges or vignette horribly which pretty much negates any benefit to having a k resolution sensor if you have to throw away those edges and leave yourself with an approximate k end result. Not that k is too little though...A large percentage of our cinema lenses vignette or have very soft edges on the dragon sensor and I see people framing their shots without that consideration all the time simply because they want to use all of the pixels that they can. ,cinematography,cmul6eh,1,t5_2ri38

3251840,0,t1_coyzzgd,Holy crap five or six stops... REALLY? Thats worse than I dreamed.Test it like its a film camera? That means youd have to run film through it to make an image. Maybe they mean to use a light meter but you really cant in a lot of circumstances as cameras all react differently to light and color.So when you say five or six stops is that three over middle gray and three under...? I thought their release version was supposed to be better. In Geoff Boyles GRR tests he at least showed you could get decent flesh tones out of raw footage but the shadows fell off a cliff.How is it under tungsten light? Thats usually the stress test. The imbalance between tons of red and very little blue is pretty hard on poorlybuilt cameras.I dont think they knew what they were getting into.

The only bump in the road is how well can you direct performance while also oping? Ive had to DP and op and thats also not unheard of  I feel its a better set up for an indie shoot as the director can concentrate on performance. For a music video? These days everyones holding a camera haha. Ive been lucky enough to DP a few larger commercial shoots where there were very specific roles for everyone  It just all comes down to the scope of the production.

3675179,0,t3_32f71c,Im getting pretty sick of companies playing fast and loose with their marketing photos  Atomos pulled this shit with their Ninja Star and it was complete bullshit.  The only way to get the ninja star setup working with a phantom is to open the phantom up and solder in an extra power lead to the ninja star because the battery weighs way too much to fly with.  Even then youre reducing flight times by more than half.  After all that the HDMI ribbon you have to use so that the gimbal can work is so flimsy and unreliable loses signal and stops recording that the whole thing is a wash.  The same will be true with the Black Magic Micro.  You might be able to get it up on a powerful quad but not a fucking phantom.  Also youre going to need to wait until someone releases a gimbal for BMMC.  As of right now there is only the zenmuse HD and below all of which are balanced and rated for GoPro weight.  There is of course the Zenmuse Z... which is  and now were back to a super expensive setup.  I love the ability to control the camera remotely.

3722223,0,t3_331916,Hey nice work! Some nice compositions there if you would indulge the feedback I would like to offer some critiquesuggestions? This is also regarding editing and directorial components too.I liked the staticity of the opening few shots. I feel like keeping that stillness and mostly wide composition throughout the film would have maintained a more consistent tone. I noticed the first real time we see our characters face is a frontal WS. When focusing on a character the camera needs to be used in a way to introduce the audience to his character give it some gravitas. This could be an ECU on his eyes or a silluette or a tableaux indicating his state of mind or confidence or a close up of a character element like the gun then raising to the face to reveal an expression. When shooting a character try to evoke elements of that character in any way you can. Sometimes this can be shot like Spielberg where you see Moment A Moment B  action reaction style fluid shots. Other times ideally for this film a static intricately composed image with carefully placed props blocking and acting can tell the audience everything they need to know about the character.Example Man trying to survive in the wilderness VWS High angle Man huddled over himself a streak of blood paints the snow diagonally accross screen leading from his position. Horizon line is very high up in frame we see the calmness of the water juxtaposed with the clearly uncomfortable situation he finds himself in. He is clearly shaken shivvering from the cold fiddling with something.Cut toECU gun being loaded frostbitten fingers try to put bullets in magazineCut toECU freezing face of man looking dazed desperate and on the edge.Here we use three shots to evoke everything we need to know this combined with a selection of your beautiful opening shots conveying the wildnerness will tell the audience everything they need to know this man is in danger and at risk but he is armed.Another suggestion would be to avoid handheld style even for PoV shots like that of the monster. Often POV shots in horror films have subtle fluid movement obviously its not easy to get a hold of a steadycam or whatever but with clever composition you can still show the audience he is being watched.Also try not to color tint POV shots I would have liked to see more of those winter tones Lastly and this is probably very subjective on my part but unless you are using a special lens or have the right enviromentframing try to avoid medium shots outside of dialogue scenes or very specific visual storytelling. Stay with the extremes and it can give you a greater degree of flare dont be afraid to go nuts and use mostly wide shots and wider and close ups and closer. I recently had some trouble filming a short trying to get those CUs with a very wide lens but despite that misstep at least the wides look nice and extreme P  I was scared the camera was going to touch the actors nose!Anyway keep up the great work! Also loved that opening shot with the tunnel.Peace,cinematography,cqgk5s9,7,t5_2ri38

Grain is basically visual dither so each scene can be different. If Im supplying Vimeo or Youtube then I use ProRes.

4295269,0,t1_cs9scfi,Correct.Hmi is a modern daylight balanced light. It emits a  kelvin temperature beam. The arc is an old tungsten carbon stick burning lamp that emits about a  k beamThe confusing part can be that the HMI its is called a mediumarc the M in HMI H is some hard to spell thing and the I iodine but no one calls it that its always referred to as an HMI . but when you hear someone refer to a light as an arc light itself were talking old  tungsten carbon stick burning lights. HMI are essentially a modern way to create an arc inside an enclosed globe as opposed to manually feeding a stick  and it  creates a daylight balanced light as opposed to a tungsten light. The consumer application of HMIs is the modern headlights in some cars with HIDs which have that whiter look daylight than the old style headlights which used tungsten bulbs.So! Arc  manually fed carbon stick burning tungsten light    you can pick these out on set by the exhaust coming out of them and a bunch of guys operating it.Modern Tungsten  tungsten bulb units      you can pick these out because the body of these lights is usually painted a reddishMaroon color HMI  daylight balanced bulb units      you can pick these out on set because they are usually painted a sky blue color. However Arri went ahead and painted ALL their lights blue just to confuse everyone thats new to lights. Then theres LEDs and fluorescents kino as exampleThats the scope of lights we use more or less.

Some SFX would certainly help even if the music stayed the same.  It felt more like a leisurely cruise in a Ford Fiesta instead of an M.  The footage looks lovely though but some of the shots were a little sloppy like the instrument shot at  the shot of the rear put it on a slider or dolly composition at  get closer to the wheels or wider out of focus at  the car stopping at  kinda halts the momentum.  The shot at  the car is going like  mph.  I think the ending would have been better with a nice landscape and the car just disappearing or a moving shot on the road like youve done with it starting behind you and passing by.Id say cut it down to  seconds and you would have the right amount of content without it feeling stale.  You definitely have some good shots though that could work for a reel.

I  would recommend viewing it later with sound if youre interested  the music is fairly important in some parts.   I did have a gimbal for one day and I was probably a little overexcited to play with it.  Never having used one before also contributes to the lack of confidence in the movement  so you are spot on with that critique.  I also wasnt happy with the shakiness of it I am sure due to my poor operator technique and could not get a satisfying stabilization in post from my weak editing skills.  The gimbal was used in the tracking shot of the clothesline and for parts the dancing scene. Most of the film was shot with the Sigma  I also used the Tokina   both with the BMPCC speedbooster. ,cinematography,d2sj2yd,2,t5_2ri38

My mm . is a great lens but the switches stick now its loud and it doesnt stop at the end of its focus range so if you go over the markings on your follow focus wont line up anymore.Little things add up to larger annoyances.I got an SLR magic used and its been peachy friend of mine has full set of rokinons and his set resolves up to K very well and we use those on an FS for corporate shoots with an odyssey Q canon to Sony mount adapter of course.In the meanwhile work with what you have and save up for the right tools as you progress.,cinematography,d56et1t,3,t5_2ri38

Using a variable ND he can use it like an exposure ring on a traditional Camcorder and set his shot for a wide or narrow depth of field As for a focus puller the beauty of using a Steadicam is that you use your body to move the subject in and out of focus and dont touch the focus on the lens.  ,cinematography,d5roefy,1,t5_2ri38

You already know what you have to do you need to let them know that since youll be busier in the fall and your time is valuable you cant waste any more of it on plans that dont happen. You can decide how forgiving or blunt you want to be. As you progress youll learn that clients like these are generally best kept at arms length if engaged with at all. I know it can be really temping to play the what if game but these people arent respecting your time at all and its super shitty of them. You can let them string you along with big promises of cool projects and travel but ultimately theyve made it pretty clear that theyre unreliable and again dont give a shit about your time. Id drop them and explain exactly why or at least distance yourself and look for clients that actually want you to do work and pay you. You can keep in touch with them but be wary. If they can barely get it together to actually start a project what do you think will happen when they owe you money?Also Id be wary of free test shoots.

You can focus to infinity solid mounts etc. Borrowlenses.com should have them if they arent available locally.FS will also give your  in p mode but only  in K. Its smaller lighter and more light sensitive than the FS. Its ND also has smaller increments. Cheaper media too. Im planning on adapting this camera for EF lenses to shoot a feature doc next month.C is also a solid option. Battery life on all three options is stellar. Honestly if you want a camera thats gonna sit on your shoulder for several hours FS is probably the way to go.,cinematography,d75rws2,1,t5_2ri38

Seems like a lower lower resolution camera with a lower bitrate codec would simplify a lot of things. Amiras would be a very good choice if youre looking for a topoftheline image. If you have to stick to Reds and RedRaw then it doesnt seem like theres any way to get around having multiple computers working on this. You either have a computer for each camera to record into and then combine the data later or record to Redmags Red makes TB minimags so you could have very long takes depending on your settings and then have multiple computers transcode the footage to a RAID overnight. ,cinematography,d84ny5b,1,t5_2ri38

In the most literal terms a Cinematographer is also a photographer thats why theyre called directors of photography.No nothing is more difficult than anything. You have landscape photographers who wake up at  in the morning to hike  hours to catch extra special golden hour light and cinematographers who sit their butts next to a monitor and sit around all day in the studio.I think its harder for a still photographer to get into cinematography as they tend to have a lone wolf sensibility that makes collaboration difficult and may not have the ability to tap into the timing and movement of a sequence and how multiple angles are cut together snd used together in a sequence.,cinematography,da80bld,2,t5_2ri38

But the budgets are small.  Million  is a very large budget movie. Usually they are around  Million . They all get subsidized money from the government which sounds good but means you are at the mercy of the public funds. Its a really weird system.The best market is advertising. Normal sized budgets lots and lots of companies getting in on commercials for online. The german industry is very wealthy.

11075089,0,t1_den4d3u,The F and the FS have very different sensors. We have F and F cameras at work. The image between those two chips is night and day different. Id put an F up against an Alexa any day. I wouldnt put an F against an Alexa for anything. Heres a little table comparing the F and the FS with an Odyssey. The F is better in a surprising number of meaningful ways. Most importantly the F has different pigments in the front of the chip when compared against the FS and F. These pigments shared between the F and F. Ive been told by Sony that they capture a wider gamut than their contemporaries but I havent seen evidence to back that up. This chart from Sony seems convincing though there isnt an apples to apples chart between Sony Arri and Red. The fact that Sony is willing to brag about it and show the chart leads me to believe its truthful but I havent seen evidence. This gamut and the way it renders everything in the middle leaves the F in a league apart from the F and FS. Everything from here down is gravy but on its own this would be enough for me to try my best to stretch for an F over an FS. Even an F on internal recording over the FS with the Odyssey. When using the AXSR or AXSR you can capture a  bit image instead of the  bit capture of the Odyssey. This means much better gradients particularly when finishing in HDR or Rec. . Its a bit ambiguous in bits. The  bit Odyssey captures  shades of red green and blue per pixel in XQ. The RR capture  shades. We can debate about whether were saving signal or noise on the bottom of the chip but at the top its a big difference. The F has a Electronic Frame Image Scan. This is Sonys version of a global shutter though they cant call it that due to some patents. The F has a base ISO of  instead of . Just pointing out differences. The F can shoot UHDk at up to fps internally with the AXSR recorder same as an Odyssey. The F can shoot UHDk SampQ at up to fps with the AXSR recorder. The F can internally shoot kHD at up to fps. This is  frames short of the fps with an Odyssey Q equipped FS. The F can shoot kHD at up to fps with the AXSR and R recorders. When shooting at p the Sony codecs are far more efficient than the ProRes counterparts I would liken ProRes  to XAVC Class  ProRes HQ to Class  and ProRes XQ to XOCN ST. When you look at the sizes next to each other the differences are mindblowing.Res | Rate | Codec | Depth | Bitrate | Recorder|||||k | p | ProRes  |  bit | Mbps | Odyssey Qk | p | ProRes HQ |  bit | Mbps | Odyssey Qk | p | ProRes XQ |  bit | Mbps | Odyssey Qk | p | XAVC Class  |  bit | Mbps | F Internalk | p | XAVC Class  |  bit | Mbps | F Internalk | p | XOCN LT |  bit | Mbps | AXSRk | p | XOCN ST |  bit | Mbps | AXSRk | p | F RAW |  bit | Mbps | AXSR or RThe codecs are sooooo much more efficient on the Sony side and in my experience Fs color is night and day better than the color from the F which uses the same chip as the FS.,cinematography,dencns7,8,t5_2ri38

11602541,0,t3_65jarn,Youre using x better gear than I used  years ago in school so youre correct the stuff a lot of us are mentioning may come into play in your future so Id just recommend looking into those options and what benefits they bring. ,cinematography,dgb5o6m,1,t5_2ri38
11606689,0,t1_dgamssc,I think you misunderstood my statements.Yes the approaches really are comparable even if at very different levels of sophistication. Sony takes a very deliberate approach of having as little curve in their HD type curve as possible. Canon works to have a strong HD type curve to their sensor.BM takes a third approach that is focused on having flat response between wavelengths for colors. It lines up on the SonyRed side of things in the HD curve instead focusing on post processing where BM is exceptionally strong.The dynamic range is actually an entirely different metric.If you understand sensors in depth its safe to stop reading hereWith the apparent confusion its worth covering how the sensor works. For this Ill be focusing on just one sense node its just repeated a few million times on a sensor.Light enters from the lens.The first thing of importance to us that it hits is the optical filter. The optical filter is there to separate out a particular color lets go with green. This is also where a lot of response behaviors can happen. Just like you can place a filter to only change the highlights or shift color temp of light in front of the lens the same kind of filtering is applied in the sensors filter. This is one of the areas that Arri has excelled in the Alexa sensor their highlight filter is just better. Arri also takes the opportunity in that filter to build the first part of their HD curve simulation probably most of it. From the color response it appear that Arri actually uses two layers lens side layer for the HD curve the second layer for color separation. Red separates out the outer layer into their OLPF. Having the filter closer or further from the sensor has certain effects that are far too complex for something this short.Im deliberately ignoring the global shutter logic as irrelevant for this.Following color separation there is the light sensitive media which is pretty much standard across everyone the differences are small and irrelevant for us. What is relevant is that the charge is stored in a capacitor. The capacitor is a point where they can actually do a lot. With the relatively enormous size of the capacitors in use relative to the node size of the chip manufacture the different shapes and sizes of the capacitors gives designers a lot to work with in terms of the response. It is hard to separate this out because it is buried so far inside the sensor but the consistent response of Panasonic sensors indicates that they probably have the best design here. The primary goals for the capacitors are consistency across a single sensor no leakage actually a lot of Reds sensor noise can be credited to capacitor leakage and charge storage this is a major part of the dynamic range.Now we reach the part that most people think matters. The capacitor is periodically read by the ADC analog to digital convertor. Red Sony Panasonic pending change in the next generation and Black Magic all use a single ADC likely all of  or  bits. The extra bits have a purpose just not to the user. Arri and some Canon both have a dual ADC design looks to be all bit ADCs. Arri and Canon then finish their HD simulation in combining the two outputs. Why not just build an ADC with the necessary curve? Because that would require immense research and the curve would change according to temperature of the ADC.The output of the ADC is the RAW data. This is also why I say that Canon and Arri RAW arent actually RAW they have a burned in HD curve.So yes I do stand by the observation that Sony and Red have similar approached and Arri and Canon have similar approaches. I refer to it as the HD curve because that is the name of the curve in film which we are emulating rather than the gamma curve name used in video. They are the same curve for this purpose.,cinematography,dgbmm94,4,t5_2ri38

Ive shot both cameras extensively and Id sum up by saying Red is much more forgiving for beginners but even when perfectly exposed will still fall flat compared to a well shot Alexa. ,cinematography,dggj4aj,1,t5_2ri38
11651420,0,t3_668txz,I found the questions to be a bit tough to answer. I use various different lights for various different situations with varying colour temperatures provided.There is no one catch all solution. The Litepanels that are colour and intensity dimmable come close but they cant perform the duty of a good HMI outdoor light.I think youll find it tough to find a perfect solution but I wish you the best of luck.,cinematography,dggpb50,9,t5_2ri38
