3661695,0,t3_32bgk6,While I cant answer your higher ended questions I can tell you about the community itself. Im an undergrad btw. The atmosphere of the college is nice. Just know the weather is very bipolar in the sense it can go from s to low s in a week. The city could use some work. Downtown Riverside is probably what you look forward to if youre looking for a nice safe area. There are a lot of crimes committed onnear campus grounds usually around the nighttime but that isnt to say it doesnt during the daytime. We have a lot of chain restaurants nearby like DENNYS and ihop but we are also known for our many boba places if thats your thing. We also have some nice thai and Vietnamese restaurants off the top of my head. A lotif not most people choose to commute out of riverside. I know some people choose to live in Moreno Valley which is maybe less than  minutes away. However the problem is parking which I suspect shouldnt be a problem for a grad student. If you have any more questions feel free to ask me here or PM me. Ill be glad to divulge. ,ucr,cq9npmo,1,t5_2s3tf

6787737,0,t1_d0ldsyl,Another First Year chiming inI have one of the last registration periods and I got all my classes. It helps if youre in a Learning Community as you get priority but the downside is your schedule is made for you. This means you might have to suffer through AMs. Honestly it depends each quarter. There are multiple periods to register so you might get lucky or not.In CS  which is the first CS class I took as a computer Engineer we learned C. You could start reviewing it but they assume you know nothing in CS I had no previous experience and teach you from the beginning. Prepare for math if its not a strong area. At least review the basics of calculus especially if you have to take the math placement test.The gym is awesome pretty much has everything you need.Campus life is what you make it. Join clubs! There are sooo many and they help you meet people that share your interests. The campus itself is very active with lots going on. Disclaimer I might be wrong on certain aspects. Make sure to do your research!If you have any other questions let me know!,ucr,d0loewb,2,t5_2s3tf

7255572,0,t3_4esft9,Expect a lot of boring stuff. Expect to be very tired on day two. Expect lines in the dining halls during meals to be insane. Expect it to be very very hot. But expect to learn a lot about UCR. Expect to make friends for life! Expect  to get a lot of good advice. You need the laptop to plan your class schedule in the session with your advisor. I had my schedule planned out and ready to go so I let someone borrow mine but it definitely is a good idea to bring it. You wont need it at all the first day. ,ucr,d22wnkm,6,t5_2s3tf
7572454,0,t1_d32ceqt,Thanks! I did end up getting into UCI however my gut tells me UCR is going to be much better than UCI. Not only because it way cheaper in terms of living but if I made half way through undergrad debt free UCI might rack up a large amount due to living and food being really expensive over there. Although I still havent visited the campus yet. I am going with an open mind. Many of my friends who are currently students at UCR says there isnt much to do around the area. However parties and exciting things like Disneyland amp the beach dont necessarily excite me. Im more of an introvert and I love alone time. So I feel like UCR might be a good fit for me. Thanks anyway! Youve been a great help!  ,ucr,d32y8w9,1,t5_2s3tf

Im not familiar with this situation at all but unless there have been significant changes to the constitution they shouldnt be able to touch the judicial branch. the constitution clearly states that only another judicial branch member can nominate impeachment of another.
