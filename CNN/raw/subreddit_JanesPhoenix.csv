1855375,0,t3_2fq441,I will likely wait until a plugin api project such as Sponge is up for download and there is a viable antigrief plugin one that logs block changes similar to LogBlock which is the one that I am using right now. It is better safe than sorry and while I know that most of you are excited about . and the server to update to it I still think that it is a bad idea to update my main concern being that  of the  whitelist players will grief. Even if they did grief I could always revert to a backup but that would ruin any progress made after the backup.Edit Well I changed my mind. If we waited that long then everyone would probably quit.,JanesPhoenix,ckcrnd0,3,t5_2yn0c
