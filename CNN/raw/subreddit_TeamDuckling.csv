Plus scales save you lots of dirty measuring dishes. Maybe redo your math for your deficit or reset up your goals in MFP. I am on mobile so I cant easily link things but Ive googled the calculations and I always use sedentary for my measurement because my daily walks are not heavy work outs. I also try super hard to not eat back any exercise calories unless I do complete a particularly difficult work out measurements for exercise are almost always grossly overestimated sadly!. But you can use your own judgement for how you treat your work out calories its totally subjective. Are you eating a lot of salty foods? I can feel my water weight from sodium even from meal to meal my fingers balloon up. Did you start a new work out regime? Ive read that when you begin working out your body holds onto water to help your muscles heal. If youre measuring accurately and your math is at a deficit you WILL lose weight. Maybe stop weighing until Friday stress can run a rampage too! It will work! ,TeamDuckling,d29780b,3,t5_3dwh4

From a physical perspective maybe your body is one that needs to eat small meals every  hoursmeals that include both carbs and protein. Or maybe your body isnt getting the nutrition it needs and its hungry for more vitamins and minerals that its just not getting enough of no matter what youre eating. From a psychological perspective maybe you were whiteknuckling through doing low card and then you got too exhausted from the effort. Maybe theres more going on within you like stress and those foods are offering a sense of comfort you need right now.If creating good habits now is what youre wanting to ensure you have a better future rather than controlling your eating Id suggest  learning how to listen to your body and listen to your feelings and  being extremely kind to yourself as you figure things out. These the two habits will best serve you now and in the future.,TeamDuckling,d2fq18n,2,t5_3dwh4

7450070,0,t3_4h5vmb,That sucks but I absolutely see her point of view. She hired you on without any idea that in a month you will need vacation time. She was probably expecting you to hit the ground running and be available for the worktrainingetc. that your new job entails. It would have been smart to mention that you had firm plans for vacation. If someone asks when youre available and you say immediately! then a week later say oh hey I can start for a week but then Im going to need the next two weeks off it is misleading. She didnt fire you so while shes disappointed she still wants you to be on the team. But definitely consider it and try to communicate stuff like this in the future. If its one thing managers hate its to be blindsided by their people. ,TeamDuckling,d2p0y8j,4,t5_3dwh4
