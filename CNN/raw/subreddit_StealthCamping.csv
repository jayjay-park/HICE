7560184,0,t3_4g2gm5,gt Looking for a place with lots of entry level jobs amp multiple stealth camping spots.Unfortunately Ive found these factors tend to work in opposition to each other. Out in the boonies you generally have more truck stops rest areas and so on not to mention isolated backroads where you could probably find an outoftheway place. There doesnt tend to be much in the way of jobs however. More developed areas meanwhile have more jobs but youre basically going to be restricted to trying to park in bigbox parking lots or in residential areas both of which I personally find to be sort of anxietyinducing.,StealthCamping,d31k1lh,1,t5_2v9qm
