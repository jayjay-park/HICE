10228291,0,t1_dc2ljq6,Suboxone kept my close friend alive and allowed him to get and stay clean. He works the steps in NA and is on subs. Our fellowship and myself included consider him clean. My stance on it is if Im not willing to accept responsibility for what happens to a newcomer if I tell them the prescribed medication they take doesnt make them clean then I shouldnt try to doctor them. I dont have an MD and in my experience the narcotics anonymous fellowship in my area has been extremely receptive to those on subs  considering them clean allowing them to hold moneykeep service positions etc. To each his own but IMO it depends on if theyre taking it as prescribed or not. It sounds like OPs gf is on too high of a dose. ,NarcoticsAnonymous,dc3fmz3,2,t5_2s3yb
