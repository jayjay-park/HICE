3451267,0,t3_2yvr4p,Have you tried blue Nile?  We ordered my ring from there  you can pick your own setting AND diamond which is awesome. Let me dig around there and see what I can come up with.We replicated a  Tiffanys ring for about .  The only difference was the colour of the diamond H vs E. The clarity and all other stats were the same if not better and it was . carat as opposed to .!EditI see now that you try blue Nile so sorry that my comment was irrelevant.  another option is if you are completely stuck on a circle for a diamond you could do a pearshaped. It makes the diamond seem a lot larger because the surface area is bigger but because it goes into a point it doesnt use quite as much as an oval or the circle. Also how big are your girlfriends hands? If she has small hands honestly a carat diamond might be too big  I have small hands and for me a carat was way too large so we ended up settling for three quarters of a carat which also saved us a lot of money. Also try looking for a diamond that is just barely under a carat. Even just a few points will save a lot on price .  .,EngagementRings,cplo6e9,1,t5_2ra25

Can you request to see it in person before finalizing the purchase?And look around on rjustengaged theres another website that tends to list the same diamonds for cheaper.,EngagementRings,cu94hix,1,t5_2ra25
5459766,0,t3_3puh02,Its expensive and depending on what his financial situation is spending  dollars on a ring might not make financial sense. If you really want to spend the rest of your life with this man carat size shouldnt matter. You can always upgrade later. ,EngagementRings,cw9jc9v,9,t5_2ra25
5541450,0,t3_3r0zme,There are a couple things to consider here. If th of a diamond is all that you can afford then that is going to be enough diamond. Starting your life together with massive debt is not romantic. I think the ring is lovely. the detail around the stone will disguise how small the center stone is. That being said the important thing is to consider what your girlfriends taste in jewelry is. Does she like filigree? Does she like lots of fine detail? Is she a more simple girl? Additional things to think about Is a diamond an absolute must? Does she even want a diamond at all? I wanted a white stone because I like the idea that it would go with anything I wore but did not want a diamond. I did a little research with my boyfriend and found alternatives that would hold up well not all stones are equal hardness or brittleness and would still be beautiful. Check out sapphires or lab created gems. I ended up going for a lab created gem call the Amora Gem. They are graded from a G to a D in color. Moissanite is a different version of it but can hold some green or yellow tints in certain lighting.  If you are considering alternatives here is a link to a video for the center stone I got. Its harder than a sapphire its whiter than a moissanite alternative and its considerably cheaper than a diamond. It was about  per carat. If youre interested please PM me and Ill send you the website. I dont want to seem like an advertiser for the lab... Im just a really happy customer who is anxiously awaiting her boyfriend to propose since he has hidden a ring away!!! Good luck I hope your search goes well.,EngagementRings,cwjyv8f,5,t5_2ra25

6460842,0,t1_czn4pe6,So I agree that the sentiment of her dads diamond will mean much more. I like the idea of a double halo but now I have no clue what to do regarding picking out the actual ring... it was quite a bit easier when it was still just a planning thing.It would ruin the surprise. My intention right now is to ask her to marry me and then after she has said yes do there is something more I need to tell you about this ring. I confirmed with her mother that she has zero knowledge of her fathers ring and so this should be a big surprise.,EngagementRings,cznlej8,1,t5_2ra25

7476296,0,t3_4hr4fy,Recent diamond purchaser here.  GIA triple excellent certified cut symmetry polish I color .Carat SI.  The diamond is AMAZING.  Save yourself some money and drop on the clarity.  You said it yourself you want it to be eye clean.  My inclusion is small and on the outside of the table which doesnt affect the brilliance of the diamond.  I was like you want the perfect shiny over  carat diamond and started with VS.  The secret is find an SI thats EYE CLEAN preferably with one small inclusion thats offcenter.  Triple X GIA certified will give you a diamond that wont disappoint.  With your budget you can find an AMAZING ring.  Good luck!!!,EngagementRings,d2s0g0e,2,t5_2ra25
7957075,0,t3_4o7v5b,Well it really depends on what your significant other likes for the knifes edge setting. It is rather unique and not very classic but could look cool if thats her style. I dont personally own one but I wouldnt think comfort would be an issue. As for the prongs definitely .,EngagementRings,d4ag7y2,3,t5_2ra25
8056158,0,t3_4piunn,Contact David Klass in Los Angeles hes done some similar settings.  Hes got ig fb and pinterest if you want to check him out  his work is top of the line and his pricing is very fair.  Ive done a couple detailed projects with him.  He will produce CADs for you to review and modify all at no extra cost. The ring you posted is very detailed I would be sure that if you go local that youve seen the work that they produce not just the stuff they sell.  Ive seen some train wrecks!,EngagementRings,d4ll6lf,1,t5_2ra25
8274844,0,t3_4spvts,The strongest stones are red white and blue ruby diamond sapphire. Whoever told you sapphires crack easily was misinformed themselves or was lying. While technically softer than diamond its not enough to make a real difference and it stands up well to heat too which is a good consideration for something that will get daily wear and therefore need occasional repair work over a lifetime.,EngagementRings,d5bwx1m,3,t5_2ra25

8694097,0,t3_4z1pls,My personal preference is ring .  The ring design stands out a bit more.  Both are beautiful choices though! ,EngagementRings,d6se4i2,2,t5_2ra25
8735486,0,t3_4zm37a,Both the diamonds are very beautiful and are good. Price of the diamond is something that is your choice whether to buy from WF or not. Both the diamonds are good but if i would have given choice then i would go with the second one basis on HCA score. ,EngagementRings,d6xl0b6,0,t5_2ra25

10054556,0,t3_5jqi3n,I bought this at a handmade jewelry store for GF of  years. I was really happy with the purchase but after spending so much time starring at it Im worried she wont like it because the corners with the prongs are a little off not evenly spaced. You can see it in the pic but its a little more obvious when looking from the top closely.I assume that handmade will never be perfect so Im not sure if Im stressing just because I keep trying to find issues with it...

10488034,0,t3_5q4faq,Its safe to buy a diamond online I bought my wifes ring that way.Ive plotted the diamond price curves from James Allen and Blue Nile so you can get an idea of what fits your budget.
