2164880,0,t3_2id30j,I rather liked setting the dummy to Repel then attack.  Start with Taki as your opponent as her A B amp K attacks have quite similar startup timing.  Run up and attack get GId then GI her counter counter yourself get GId etc.You only learn one timing this way but just to get the basic inputs and timing down doing this for awhile can help.  Also by starting the practice with a Repel your character cant block Takis A attack so a GI is your only way out.  IIRC you can block her B and K so if youre kinda sloppy with your inputs you might get a block instead but A will get through every time if you dont GI yourself.After youve messed with that for awhile set up Kilik or Tira with the same settings and then try to GI the AIs counters.  The timing on their K vs. B is very different which will hurt your brain for awhile.Good times.,SoulCaliburV,clf08j6,2,t5_2sxdz
