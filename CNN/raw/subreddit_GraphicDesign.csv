100088,0,t3_1v8gzz,Print isnt dead. There are print jobs that pay well. There are also other avenues of design that dont necessarily require web either. Brand coordinating and business marketing to name a couple. Frankly I find most print enthusiastic designers bark up the wrong trees when it comes to finding a job. The more creative jobs tend to almost always be temporary and pay the least. No you will never make any money that is worth while doing album covers and posters. You could try your hand at designing menus for restaurants but there are only so many and most business owners wont shell out cash for anything they think they can do for free. The real money in print is boring stuff like manufacturing print prep. Basically it means putting garbage art files on templates for print. Second would be in publishing. Typesetting books and making book covers for a publishing house can be relatively lucrative if you are good at it. Furthermore if you have basic HTML coding skills transitioning to ebook typesetting can also be exceptionally lucrative as most authors have no idea what they are doing in that field but want to expand in to it. ,GraphicDesign,ceptqan,6,t5_2qrct

Its the best option for people that dont know anything about computers and wont even care but still wish to have a computer that does the job. Thats why its still so popular in the creative industry you dont have to wonder if youll be able to run your software if there is a mac version of it and you buy a new mac it will. Its also way easier to fix issues as you just have to know the model and year of your mac to get assistance andor infos on how to do it. Buying a mac isnt as much about hardware as it is about comfort. Its more expensive than a matching PC but you just plug it and work and dont have to spend one afternoon uninstalling norton and shit.

The main reason is that you view the posters at several feet away. Large format printers are generally low quality up close even when you print from vector you can set to high quality but it takes forever and makes no difference.

But for the volume you are talking its a SHITTON of work no? Thats all work done on the speculation that you will sell these shirts and make money. IF your work makes me money Ill give you some money. No. Your options are thus for this business planOption A Find a designer willing to work for a nominal fee per design. Say  a shirt. If the shirt sells  shirts you pay no additional fees to the designer. However if the shirt sells a designated amount of shirts you will pay the designer a percentage of the profits. Say  of the profit per shirt. You are doing the management distribution promotion all that stuff. But you should pay the designer a royalty for each shirt that makes you money. You can negotiate a payment scale like this Shirts Sold  Shirts Sold  Shirts Sold  Shirts Or whatever.Option B Learn about typography and design. Get yourself a big kit of stock fonts and art the hipster logo styles are so hot right now. Blurg. from a place like www.designcuts.com and just mass produce every comment you can by yourself. It shouldnt be hard to use Illustrator and export good quality EPS files with nice fonts and illustrations. Your concepts arent bad its just the execution thats lacking which comes with time and experience.

1219875,0,t3_282u9u,Heres how I do it.Pull out the notebook open Illustrator get the Bamboo or a combination of all three. Scribble down every single design idea you can come up with regardless of how bad it looks. Play with shapes and typography until you figure out what it is youre looking for. Then choose no more than  to send to the client and let him choose from them. Never never never never never send the client your entire sketch portfolio unless they specifically ask for it and even then carve out some of the shittier design stuff and only show them the good stuff. Remember that its not worth your time to refine a logo if its not going to be used. These are mockups not finished pieces and hes not paying for  complete and polished logos. Obviously dont send them sketches on lined notebook paper but certainly dont spend a whole lot of time refining mock ups. If he likes one THEN you refine it but dont invest more time into this than is necessary. Time is money after all and while youre refining  rough drafts you could miss another potential client.Posting here for critique isnt a bad idea either.

Your live trace will come out much smoother. Truth be told you can screen print from a bitmapped .tif since its just black and white with no grey tones but if you live trace it you have some more options for editing in illustrator its really up to what you prefer at that point.,GraphicDesign,cm0qxjy,2,t5_2qrct
2347943,0,t3_2m8jyc,I like the spade logo with just one aperture in the middle.  My style preferences personally tend to lean towards clean and simple  but I think the additional elements make for kind of a mess.  Lose the smaller ones in the spade and all the external tripod and cameras. Or go with a clean camera silhouette and use a simpler spade within that shape. Also the font treatments look super s yearbook photoish. Go on www.dafont.com and search through sans serif fonts until you see something that fits. Also make sure to check licensing info on the font if you do use any. Maybe try looking up some logos of photographers you like for reference too. Research goes a long way and a professional looking crisp logo and great photography over all else will give you great confidence when it comes to selling your services.

Most of your work is incredibly similar and because of this your portfolio reads more like a single series of work. You need to explore different styles of design and practice your typographic and grid use. The majority of your pieces are center aligned and demonstrate a lack of attention to composition.

Or you could partner up with a designer and share the revenue with them.If youre not trying to make money I guess it doesnt matter how they look ,GraphicDesign,cq4dccq,1,t5_2qrct
3644184,0,t3_31x6pr,Hi nayregnuIt depends on your goals!Im a young graphic designer who didnt study it at university and have had fulltime graphic design jobs since the key is a killer portfolio and showing your enthusiasm for any job you apply to. Some employers may care whether youve got a degree but theyre more likely to be interested in what you can create.If you want to develop for your own personal interests go for it. Ive taught on design degrees and cant underestimate how learning from someone who wants to see you develop has no substitute. Just research the price and quality of options available first of course.I hope that helps!,GraphicDesign,cq7nwo4,1,t5_2qrct

3756196,0,t3_33ev0u,Its pretty bad. It almost doesnt look like a logo but rather a cut and paste of clip art at low resolution.You are most likely not a designer and trying to explain the principles of design and typography in a few sentences is quite difficult.You cant design a good logo in  minutes. If you are serious about design I would recommend either taking classes or reading up on design and typography principles. Please take this as advice and not as an attack. Best of luck.,GraphicDesign,cqkfmp0,5,t5_2qrct

3930474,0,t3_35c9oz,I design hockey jerseys for a living and can give you a few tips on this. The first being learn everything that you can about the client. In this case the instagram for Tatjana Tikhonov is a good place to start. Shes located in the San Jose area and works with the Jr. Sharks. Because of this you can now specify the exact colors which ironically I posted over in rhockeydesign today. The teal is PMS  and silvergray is PMS . Next silhouette is a completely blacked out player not a one color rendition of a player.I would highly recommend that you take a look over at sportslogos.net and look at some of the minor league allstar logos. They tend to vary a lot more than the pro ones which helps generate ideas. Something around this would probably hit the sweet spot.Also be sure you are designing in a vector app IllustratorCorelDRAWInkscape. Doing things like this in Photoshop is just learning bad habits for the future.,GraphicDesign,cr4b5xo,2,t5_2qrct
