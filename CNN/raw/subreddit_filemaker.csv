38063,0,t3_1ujnxl,Yes you can easily create a container field to store just about anything. Alternatively you can create text fields with filepaths and store the documents elsewhere. Then scripting will allow a button click to open the file. I manage a FileMaker database for a Creative Department and we use both methods extensively within FileMaker.,filemaker,ceirj9a,2,t5_2s6v8
391144,0,t1_cfkp88b,I honestly think that the LandTypes and ServiceTypes TOs are redundant.  Specifically I would think that the field for storing the type of Land that a record is would be stored in the Lands table and not the LandsTypes table.  It essentially accomplishes the same thing while cutting down the complexity of the TOs.Can you give me a pic of the layout in layout mode so that I can see what youre working with?  Also if youre attempting to create a related set of records automatically then youre going to have to do some type of scripting to automatically generate the join record as youre not going to be able to do it via a relationship.  Why not try creating static records that should display what youre attempting to do?  At least that way you can see if the TOss and the layout are correct.Edit Something I just noticed.  Unless a Holding can generate a Service I think that the Services should be a child TO of Lands as correct if Im wrong here its not the Holding actually generating the Service as the ability to generate a Service is a virtue of having the Land that generates the Service.Also more like this?

791449,0,t1_cgtjym5,You rock man. Im gonna use that applescript do you know if I can use a valuelist to input files? Im looking at the Replies screen of the applescript editor and the way files are entered seems strange. Ill have a look around online and try to figure this one out.,filemaker,cgu8pjk,2,t5_2s6v8
1202312,0,t1_ci452ew,Then it should work fine. Technically it will be just a filtered portal to an auxiliary table. Hmm... youll need a relationship to this table from everywhere this is not good. Maybe it can be a global repeating field whose repetitions are set at startup this way you can use it from anywhere. Or it can be a static set of elements on a tab control with invisible tab headers this is harder to scale though.,filemaker,ci4vmp8,1,t5_2s6v8

3196307,0,t3_2wplfi,If you look at the button setup do you have anything in the Script Parameter field?  If you dont look at what it is in the template and match it to what it should be in your solution. ,filemaker,cotaphs,2,t5_2s6v8
3644936,0,t1_cq7pcy9,Scripting isnt the problem for me what I am looking for is a solution that can send a mail instantly. I will schedule a server script every  minutes to see how it goes. Thanks for helping. ,filemaker,cq7qzlk,1,t5_2s6v8

4534713,0,t1_csw50jp,Thanks for taking the time to look at this.  I ended up running a windows scheduled task to kill filemaker.exe and then relaunch it on the affected machines after midnight.  This has fixed the issue so it seems the underlying problem was that filemaker simply wasnt updating the date before logging an entry.,filemaker,ct28elt,1,t5_2s6v8

4952417,0,t1_cuik8ng,FERPA or other sensitive data should also be considered. From what OP listed it doesnt look like any of the data would be considered sensitive but as they add that type of data any hosted solution will need to be vetted for storing that data. Hosting FM onsite in their own cloud instance could help with that.,filemaker,cuisj49,2,t5_2s6v8
9044369,0,t1_d7y606a,took me  minutes.Although your solution will work and keeps you to a max of  channels on a mixer I assume Ive made it so you can create as many or as few as you wish  in list view.If you wanted you could then add related data and  for example have a table of gig which related to a subset of the patch data this would give you historic setups for reference along with the ability to preprep for the gig. just as examplesIve gone no further than just a tiny quick setup showing how you only need  fields along with a primary key good habitHopefully it will help you learn a bit more.Let me know if you want more help  im happy to help you learn.alex  absolutemusic.,filemaker,d7yzle0,1,t5_2s6v8
11070769,0,t1_demu73l,And this will allow me to merge the entries I need merged so the relevant data that differs between entries are both still present in Filemaker?,filemaker,demv0p8,1,t5_2s6v8
