11055953,0,t1_dekzo9c,Like I said it could have its merit in a single player campaign. But for competitive multiplayer who would want to play as the nations that were severely lacking in industrial capacity andor manpower when those issues would be represented in the games combat?

11478320,0,t3_63rql6,I actually really like this feature. Unarmed transport trucks cluttering everything was a big annoyance to me in Wargame. With armed transports still hanging around I think Eugen made a really good design choice. ,Steel_Division,dfx2b30,1,t5_3jbdp
11517614,0,t3_64cklz,In a stream the devs specifically said no paradropping into battle. The reasoning is that the Paratroopers  dont drop directly into battle that would be suicide. It is implied that they have already been delivered to their drop zones and are joining the battle as elite infantry. Which is essentially what happened historically. Crete is the only exception that comes to mind however. ,Steel_Division,dg1iu9x,3,t5_3jbdp

11553827,0,t1_dg5bq0m,Yeah but many games are  minute time limit and sometimes game end faster than that due to score limit and they often lose  of map in phase A and B. So dont need rely on C.If games had more time limit  hours then they would had more chance of comeback in late game.So even if they get lot in phase C still need to play early game and not wait for best C stuff while losing map.,Steel_Division,dg5motv,1,t5_3jbdp

11574212,0,t3_6562ni,Men of War is very different from SD. but very very good  definetly worth buyingAs for Wargame SD is a hell of a lot easier. Not only is the WG playerbase ridiculously skilled SDs game mechanics are easier to pick up.,Steel_Division,dg7xygm,2,t5_3jbdp
11576462,0,t1_dg86eac,By the way if the bug happens you can ask any transport unit to pick up the gun and move it to the position you want. Because the gun is already on the map the bug wont happen again.,Steel_Division,dg87545,1,t5_3jbdp

11616975,0,t1_dgcrb5b,Micromacro trade off at that point though. I like to hide them behind cover and bring them up when theres a target. Or just keep a lot of AA around the area not to actually do anything lol mostly for the psychological effect ,Steel_Division,dgcslxu,2,t5_3jbdp
11630468,0,t1_dgeah39,I dont remember which fire tooltip this was for but for one of them it said napalm had the potential to wipe out an entire squad nearly instantly. Not sure if thats actually reflected in a hidden stat somewhere.,Steel_Division,dgebr02,2,t5_3jbdp

11687373,0,t3_66rs2j,I know recon units do not effect the front line. They also dont suffer the same morale penalty for being behind enemy lines. I think recon transports effect the front line but Im not positive. Id love to see how the front line is calculated or if theres any other units that dont effect it. Theres no obvious way to tell if a unit effects the front line or by how much that I can see. Do different units have a greater impact? ,Steel_Division,dgks50m,3,t5_3jbdp

11719188,0,t1_dgods8g,My problem is the air war is so important and AA is not effective due to the fact they dont stop players from bombing they dont kill planes and they are easy for planes to kill. It is simply better to buy fighters and accept that your enemy is going to bomb your ground units. If the best way to deal with tanks was not in the AntiTank tab you would rightly be confused. All I want is for AA to actually ether do something to planes or show somewhere that they are not able under almost every circumstance to hit a plane.,Steel_Division,dgoecys,-1,t5_3jbdp
11720269,0,t1_dgohykd,The main problem I have is the game is giving me no feedback as to why my AA is ineffective. Honestly tho it wouldnt matter if bombers were less accurate. However ether planes need to be made less effective or AA needs to be made better. Losing  Bofors was one match against a Luflander player and he got them all with planes. I was a tad hyperbole however there are only really two reliable ways to win long games one is air power the other is artillery. There are lots of ways to deal with artillery but the only way to effectively deal with aircraft is to have ether more or better aircraft.,Steel_Division,dgoirj2,0,t5_3jbdp

11746601,0,t1_dgq09ak,The Pak  is a terrible antitank gun... it was obsolete in  let alone . But it should still go through a Bren carrier or a halftrack like a hot knife through butter.There is something wrong with AT guns and cover... the whole point of a towed AT gun over something like a Marder is its a lot easier to conceal in cover but it seems like in game you can either shoot or be concealed. A Pak  is about as small as an AT gun gets but as soon as it fires its just instantly spotted and hosed down with long range MG. Its just not that easy to spot a concealed gun at  metres... even after its fired.,Steel_Division,dgri9cf,1,t5_3jbdp
