11361813,0,t3_621el4,Im doing research on BCI Brain Computer Interfaces BMI  Brain Machine Interfaces here is what I think.Pros Improving human cognition  TLDR we went from ape level intelligence to human level with the growth of our neocortex. Now we can do things our ancestors cannot fathom wouldnt it be great to do that again? See Ray Kurzweill for talks on this. As an added bonus its a potential partial solution to the general AI  problem. Treating illness If we can read and write to the brain like a computer then virtually any mental illness could be cured. Adding senses on a similar vein to improving cognition we could add new senses or fix broken ones. Immortality if you can read and write from a brain like a computer you could surely download all the information in it and replicate it. The question is is that replica you or a clone? See the  initiative for approximate timelines. The matrix.Cons End of free will when governments go bad the people revolt and take back their freedoms by force. Imagine if nobody but the elites has free will governments would have no backlash from the people and the results would be purely market forces pushing for whatever they may push for. Brains treated like computers you only have to look at Wikileaks or Snowden to know everything you hav ever done is watched and recorded. The government is watching at every level of every device they have control. With BCI the same is true for your brain with that comes the end of free will but what else? Also computer viruses for your brain malfunctions or anything else that goes wrong with your computer. The matrix.ConclusionThe pros especially improving cognition could allow us to do things we cannot fathom today and truly show humanity prospering in a utopia. The cons literally the end of humanity as governments and corporations take over. Its going to be an interesting few decades.              ,Neuralink,dfju9c4,2,t5_3jq7d

Basically the enhanced individuals would be the workerbees while the rest of humanity can live more freely because these workerbees would be X better than a single individual as anyone using this technology would be able to be interconnected as well. Imagine immediate teamwork  collaboration  understanding perspective  quantifying layers of data and creating the models we dont have yet so we can properly geoengineer earth to save it  everything.,Neuralink,dfkb595,1,t5_3jq7d
11749523,0,t1_dfju9c4,I dont know if itll be quite the end of free will as such but I do think the computers built into us will be hackable and exploitable. Weve seen that selfdriving cars can be remotely hijacked weve seen that cellphones can be used to snoop even when off. Brain security becomes a big issue that well need to get right from the start.,Neuralink,dgru66c,1,t5_3jq7d
