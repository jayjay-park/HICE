Black market doesnt mean illegal it simply means a secondary market in economic terms. For instance Cuban cigars are sold on the black market in America. But its only illegal to transport the product not to smoke it. You too obviously have no idea what the term black market means economically.  ,SteamGameSwap,cfqxfoy,1,t5_2skv6

I was clarifying.You can disagree with someone but still respect their opinion. Disagreeing is not the same thing as saying youre not welcome. Thats the most preposterous comparison ever. Saying youre not welcome here is pretty much the same as forcing a person not to say certain things which is exactly what silencing is. So I disagree with how you define disagreeing but Im not going to downvotesilence you just because I disagree with you.And no there are times when the majority is wrong. Reddit is particularly wellknown for its circlejerking everywhere which is why people think its not the most efficient structure.,SteamGameSwap,cfyhc3n,-4,t5_2skv6

518835,0,t1_cfz4s7r,I would not be surprised if buying packs as gifts when youre not supposed to be able to and using an exploit to buy a different steam package than the one presented in your country is also against steams TOS. However these exploits occur daily All the time. I have yet to see any Russian steam accounts come into harms way. A while back there was a time where I could point to a Russian dealer and say He got banned because he bought loads of packs very actively. However recently I found out that he was actually banned because someone made a false report to steam support and he has since been unbanned. Now while this is a quasi unrelated subject as far as VPNing goes Id like to also say that I havent seen anyones steam accounts affected for using a VPN. In fact I found a link ish down from the top from the google query you provided where some people claimed to use VPNs All the time and have never had anything happen to their accountsNow Im not going to say that penalties are an impossibility Because it is against their ToS I however would like to say that it would be a bit misleading to completely dismiss the use of a VPN for game activation. Im not even saying that that is what youre saying Just saying that that is what your text could be interpreted as.As far as South Park and Germany goes Im pretty sure starting the download under a VPN and resuming it off the VPN did the trick.

950856,0,t1_chcd8d9,Came here to say this.Trading works with supply and demand. When a big sale happens a lot of traders stock up on games and due to regional pricing some people are able to sell at a low value for longer time. Hence the market stays at a low value. Which is why trading is alive. If we marked up everything to store value then there wouldnt be a lot of reason to trade.TLDR Trading is cheaper than buying because reasons.Just look around some posts and youll see how you can get games at a  discount or more.,SteamGameSwap,chcdc6r,1,t5_2skv6

3895145,0,t1_cr01ybf,Thanks for reposting you obviously put a lot of effort in here and I wanted to make sure you had your points addressed.. Looking at our flair guide it doesnt look like we have that in there how to search for a user I will add language in there to make that more clear. You can go to the search bar on rsgsflair and type any users reddit user name with or without the u in front. It will show all flair profiles theyve ever made. Theres a reason we make the titles so strict.Regarding adding a flair profile to your flair that has your steam link I think that would be technically possible but very had to implement. Unfortunately I dont know enough about the bot to know if it would be able to combine those but if so I bet it would take a lot of workpower to code that system and then figure out if our css will still read users who dont have a flair profile vs those who do. We have almost  subscribers and although I cant see how many actual accounts we have registered thats a lot of possible flairs to have to edit. Searching their name on rsgsflair is really the best we have at the moment.. I dont want to say confirming a trade is tedious by design but it does have some unintended benefits. Im comparing this to say a . i traded with x here . i traded with y here type of list.  Users who are only out looking to cause harm usually dont want to go through the process just to scam someone. They will just go to other non rep websites and do their business there.  By listing all trades in a profile a moderator or another trader can quickly see what kind of trader the OP is. If I know they have green flair but all they traded were really cheap games for other games I might be more leery as if they had a lot of paypal transactions for aaa games.  It acts a bound contract. There are absolutely no disputes to if the trade was made. Both the OP and commenter agree that this trade was made and it should be black and white.Note that this method is what most of reddits trading websites use. For example.  rgcxrep rigsrep By using a user name mention in the confirmation link udragonsteam youll find that you got a user name tag notification in your inbox which is different than a reply. You can view all of these from your inbox or directly at  In our guide we specifically ask to use u and not just their user name. That way whenever the user comes on reddit they will see an inbox notification and you dont have to send them a link to confirm. I think that is pretty simple and shouldnt require a bot to have to message the other user just to get them to reply. Automated flair systemWere unfortunately limited by what the bot and reddit can do. We cant implement and kind of checkboxes or popup notifications. The only thing it looks like your design would help is not having users type the permalink to the comment and who they traded with. There still has to be a public record of what was traded. Youre right that a lot of users just type Added or I can do that trade or something along those lines. Making them type that there instead of a confirmation post if anything seems more tedious. I personally dont want to make the bot say who you traded with I want you to copy or retype their name so you know you didnt get hit with a phisher.We could have our bot report all trades that arent confirm but I really dont see it being a big deal. I rarely find trades that dont have a confirmation link. If others think thats a good idea I can forward that to the bot master. If another user is not agreeing to confirm a trade for you message us and we will try and help.Regarding making users type what they want to trade there is a discussion going on about that hereUs moderators do patrol the flair profiles usually once a week I go through and make sure everything is kosher and we really dont find many trades where users are trying to game the system. I dont often see users edit their post and if its edited more than a day after I will usually question them on it. If anything seems suspicious we will remove it. We dont expressly tell users not to edit their post but we are absolutely aware of the possibilities. I believe in the past we were going to have Automoderator copy any comment made by OP the initial . . . confirmation  and repost it that way OP couldnt edit it. Then the other trader would reply to Automoderator saying confirmed. That could also be something we could look into but I dont think we have as many issues with users trying to fake trades to make this necessary.,SteamGameSwap,cr0a44i,2,t5_2skv6

You can follow it to the actual registration link. If you think we can make changes to that please give us suggestionsEvery time a white flair submits a thread they receive this message We actually just created a similar message to gray flair users who submit a thread.So IMO freshly registered users and users who submit a thread should have read the rules. That leads us to users who registered a while back and didnt go through this loophole and users who only comment on users trades. If you have suggestions to really emphasize that we have rules to this group Im all ears. We talked about having AM pm all white flair comments but if you post  comments in a day thatd be  message you receive which is super spammy.gtThere needs to be a bot that can track whether a gift is tradable or notThatd be a uwarheat question. I have no idea if thatd be possible. If so we could probably have it message the modsreport it for us to double check.gtShould we really trust higher flairs?We came up with some higher flairs for   trades and made a PSA about it. We received surprisingly negative responses about its so we put that on hold.Thanks for the comments,SteamGameSwap,cuvs7tr,1,t5_2skv6

If its from a valid source then its okay but just saying I bought it from the humble store isnt good enough if there is overlap. You can request that someone shows that proof as well as we require all sellers here to have full disclosure. Still please report any post you think is a problem and well take a look.If we see a significant rise in key spam or start having problems with these keys we can reevaluate our stance but for now only keys purchased in the regular bundles are restricted and keys purchased via authorized store fronts are not.,SteamGameSwap,cvm7f1v,1,t5_2skv6

If anyone adds you randomly they just saw your post arent a registered user here and are going to scam you.

The reason I dindnt stock up on DayZ during the sale is because the discount was limited and the game is currently way less popular than Arma .Ive been trading on this subreddit for a long time and Im well aware of what Im doing. ,SteamGameSwap,d02ipf8,2,t5_2skv6
