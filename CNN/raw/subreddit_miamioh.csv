4761287,0,t3_3g3dsd,Dont have a picture but I was in Stanton my first year. The rooms are quite basic bed desk and chair for each person. We had one small closet apiece but others had to share a single large one. Community bathroomshower at the end of the hall. Not all the rooms are the same size so talk with your roommate about the configuration. Youll likely want to bunk the beds to gain floor space.Dont bring too much stuff on movein day. Unless home is super far away you can always go back for or buy items that you end up needing later. And most parents will be ecstatic to bring you stuff from home if only to have a reason to see you ... They might not say it but theyll be missing you hard. Movein is a hectic day so pack into as few bags as you can to get in and out quickly. Think as if youre packing for a long vacation rather than moving out.You may also want an area rug the floors are tile but wait until you know your room dimensions.,miamioh,ctupdkq,1,t5_2v4t9

8412040,0,t1_d5skpkm,My roommate worked freshman year at Dorsey Market and he loved it. His scheduling was very flexible and the job was low stress. He played music and chatted up people as they came in. Even got a lot of homework down. Plus its very easy to get started. Great way to make some beer money and is much better than working late nights dealing with drunk people at the bars. ,miamioh,d5t1rwg,1,t5_2v4t9

10400144,1,t3_5oy3i5,Im definitely going and I hope they let the audience ask questions. If you dont have anything going on please PLEASE get the word out. I believe in free speech so Im not at odds with giving this hate speech a platform but I think we need to show these people that Miami doesnt tolerate bigotry.If you need to see this intolerance and racism for yourself visit the raltright subreddit. ,miamioh,dcmx8kp,3,t5_2v4t9
11058332,0,t1_delfgpn,Ive sent them an email and Im waiting on a response.  Obviously thats the best source.  Ive generally heard though that the credits even if they dont count towards general ed will count as an elective.  If you dont believe that to be a case Id love to know. More information I will have completed the entire transfer module so unless the laws change regarding the transfer module I should be good there.  Thanks for giving me advise though!  I really appreciate it!,miamioh,delfzgl,2,t5_2v4t9
