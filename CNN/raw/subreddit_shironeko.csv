6243952,0,t1_cyza546,Haha dont need to say sorry. I rerolled a couple of times for Shizuku since I thought she would help me a lot in doing quests faster means more gems faster then more gems mean more characters to summon and help me clear most of the content. I remember the time when I did   summon for Ashley or Ruushe but no luck then I decided to do a single summon since I was a bit sad and guess what I got a freaking Ashley. No Ruushe tho. AND I DONT HAVE  WEAPONS FROM THE GACHA DAMN IT... So I only see Ashley with a pair of fish as weapons  From Chaguma Map ,shironeko,cyzdb70,2,t5_3b6gc

6606033,0,t3_465fm8,Haha yup as one of the lucky ones to have both Premio and Peak I agree with most of what you said.Premio for me too is more fun to play and as you said Peak shits on every level where I can use her.Im just hoping the warrior memorial will be even more ridiculous! ,shironeko,d02mala,1,t5_3b6gc

6703833,0,t1_d0bx4hd,Yep still have to wait for actual reviews. Some units look good on paper but not that good in practice ... awkward targeting animation etc etc.,shironeko,d0cqfyg,1,t5_3b6gc

7160008,0,t1_d1rz2qs,I think I already installed that but its not letting me play missions with my new units. I keep getting an error code  or something like that. I keep trying to pull up the Japanese google play but Im having difficulty. What would you recommend for an android user for the easiest time?,shironeko,d1s0uwf,1,t5_3b6gc

7433925,0,t3_4h3ukw,Only worth rolling for those who have the furries. Their motif addresses the weakness they have. Must get IMO.,shironeko,d2n6ukc,1,t5_3b6gc

8296734,0,t1_d5ejo9q,was comparing in terms of game mechanics for recent fencers. a more accurate description could be premio with armor?,shironeko,d5enetz,1,t5_3b6gc
8299992,0,t3_4szkn4,Before their motif release I think that all of them are top tier except Sophie and Walter. The most important rolls depends on where do you lack but the variant fencer and charlotte are the best imo.My opinion on themDeen Very strong and tanky and he has beam. With premio sword is almost imposible to die and you can use cursed sword as well. Top  fencerWalter He is a bit weird to play and can be risky to use his skills  in high difficult content. His main flaw is that he is squishy very squishy. Sophie Useful archer with water dmg. Her main flaw is that her cloud doesnt give her sp and that she doesnt have a heal over time so she is squishy. She has a beam as well. Her motif may fix her tho.Meg I dont have her but she is probably the best lancer?my last lancer is meyrin lolClive I feel like he is strong easy to use and very tanky. Probably the best DR for difficult contentJuda I dont have him but he is probably the most useful roll for those with no variant or even if you have palmeeiji another variant is awesome. He hits very hard.Karen Very good gameplay she is basically a summoner. Top  mage in my opinion. Not really a must if you have ruushehisokamerido tho. Her lack of support is her main flaw I guess.Liam Very strong CS top . He is an important roll if you dont have Tina imo. My last cs was chaguma Charlotte and he is a huge upgrade. Main flaw is lack of status resist slow starter.Charlotte She hits very very hard has a beam as charge attack she has resolve HoT and triple barrier! She is top  fighter and one of the best pulls imo.,shironeko,d5f224m,1,t5_3b6gc
8995294,0,t1_d7sxype,Thanks! Fixed it now.I kind of tested it on the Muscle Golem boss Easy Mode  by making it hit Pon with its dangerous attack  times with and without buffs. | Normal | Breath | S | Both |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Average |  |  |  | Damage Taken |  | . | . | .Apparently  is the limit to how much you can reduce the damage taken.    So my little test was a pointless waste of time since I could have simply searched first.,shironeko,d7t3fhn,2,t5_3b6gc
