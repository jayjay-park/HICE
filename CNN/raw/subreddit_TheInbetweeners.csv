4435175,0,t3_3bu9yg,Thats very common among British sitcoms most dont run for more than  or  seasons and they typically only have  episodes per season. Look at Father Ted Fawlty Towers The Office Black Books etc. British TV shows just tend to end when they should end as opposed to American shows which are milked way past their expiry date as long as they still make money.,TheInbetweeners,cspqnlz,23,t5_2s5g5
