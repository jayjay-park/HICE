3090333,0,t3_2vdkcq,Very cool!The darker red colours always look brilliant on older bikes. Enjoy it dude. ,Vintage_bicycles,coib7zh,1,t5_356m5
4678819,0,t1_ctk8a6d,Yes absolutely. When someone upgrades an older bike especially a low end frame the bike is almost always worth more parted out. The wheels are worth more than the frame for sure.  If you have the original wheels you could put them back on and sell it that way and sell the new wheels separately.edit also what kind of hubs are those that the wheels cost you ? I would not expect wheels with Sun rims to be more than  unless the hubs are really high end.,Vintage_bicycles,ctkba64,1,t5_356m5
5143535,0,t1_cv5lsb4,Thank you!  Ive already made contact with one of five local bike shops to help me with the process.  I am not confident enough with this kind of a repair to go it alone but your help allows me to go into the shop knowing a thing or two.  Next steps in improving the bicycle  A rear rack better lighting finding a brooks saddle and brakes that work more effectively when wet.  ,Vintage_bicycles,cv5zljd,1,t5_356m5

6514307,0,t3_44tuwb,Thank you guys so much for all the information to give me an insight on how to do this properly as well as explaining terms. You guys are wonderful and I hope to see you guys one the road!Hopefully by March shell be good as new and maybe even better!,Vintage_bicycles,czt4pc2,1,t5_356m5
6658874,0,t3_46u11f,Very nice allday bike but you need a fitting as its a hair large for you. Level the saddle and consider a shorter stem and youll be more comfortable.,Vintage_bicycles,d0832ef,2,t5_356m5
7708633,0,t3_4kvbjz,Gorgeous. The Sprite is my favourite Raleigh to ride. ,Vintage_bicycles,d3if4q3,2,t5_356m5
7821963,0,t1_d3v3oxi,based on my experience with peugeots if the frame isnt lugged like the older peugeots then most everything will be standard diameter except seatpost. Youll be fine. Obviously you are not looking to get a bike to upgrade the parts just to commute with... Besides these bikes look perfectly functional changing a saddle and bar tape is about as much as you need to do. If you wanted to completely upgrade this bike with newer components or high end vintage this is what you need to worry about the wheels are most likely not C and therefore you will need long reach brake calipers in order to put C wheels on.but this leads to the question of why would you upgrade an entry level mixte bike anyway? they look best with their original components and you dont need it to go fast or shift perfectly smoothly. I would bargain for it see if you could get it for less...  is ok for this type of bike... but you can probably knock it down,Vintage_bicycles,d3v96rl,3,t5_356m5

8201541,0,t1_d51maci,We picked up another Mixte the other day but a Nishiki. Fully lugged frame gas pipe but nice smooth ride. It was fully equipped with Arabesque Shimano  which sold us on it. We are upgrading the wheelset from the steel to vintage Alloy c wDuraAce hubs which should lighten things up a bit.Currently installing cork grips VO hammered fenders and a Soma Deco Rear Rack. Brakes are next on the list. It will  be a sweet ride when complete.Good luck with the Sprite!,Vintage_bicycles,d52qvp8,1,t5_356m5
8570525,0,t1_d6cu57i,Im thinking about buying it just to try it out. If its too small I might try and sell it as is to see how much I can get for it. Or I could try and fix it up a little and sell it. Not sure what to do exactly.,Vintage_bicycles,d6cwb7m,1,t5_356m5

9771719,0,t3_5f2t13,It is certainly worth . Value depends a lot on condition. If its in typical rideable condition it could be worth  or so. If its pristine maybe . If its beat maybe .,Vintage_bicycles,dahkx0l,1,t5_356m5
10054836,0,t1_dbhctvi,There is a modern equivalent that works with aero brake cable routing but would look totally out of place on a bike of this age.,Vintage_bicycles,dbi647r,2,t5_356m5
10373886,0,t1_dcjvx35,Im thinking somewhere around  or less. Any suggestions? ,Vintage_bicycles,dcjxxqz,1,t5_356m5
10454772,0,t1_dct4l2b,Check the bottom bracket threading. If it is not Italian threaded then it is not a Colnago. I dont think that it is in any case. The seat cluster looks British. Still it could be a decent frame if it is indeed made of  Reynolds tubing. ,Vintage_bicycles,dct5id9,3,t5_356m5
