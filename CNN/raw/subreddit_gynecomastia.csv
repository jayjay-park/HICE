4065486,0,t3_34x51a,M long time sufferer of gyno recently had the surgery and the cold thing used to happen to me all the time too. ANY time I was cold enough to get a nipple erection the gyno looked almost unnoticeable. Even flickingtwisting them made it x better. Although we cant be  without pics it sounds like gyno to me! from my experience anyway,gynecomastia,crjozuo,1,t5_2sq54
4695429,0,t1_ct327cl,Question by doctors do you mean surgeons who specialize in this condition or a general doctor? Because my regular doctor told me years ago that it would go away and it never did. Now Im finally dealing with it.,gynecomastia,ctmee4v,1,t5_2sq54

7944803,0,t3_4nw5o0,Best thing to do is go see your primary care physician and ask them about the process. If its causing you pain and interfering with your pt they will definitely cover it. Even if it just bothers you and you tell your doctor about it it will still most likely get taken care of. However Id rather spend the money and see a civilian doctor any day then take my chances with the military doctors. Thats just my opinion. ,gynecomastia,d492jb7,1,t5_2sq54
8267056,0,t3_4s3451, Wonder if the opposite is true because Im  weeks post op and still feel like my chest protrudes too much. The doctor said theres a fair amount of muscle in my chest but at this point I still dont feel comfortable in public without a compression shirt. Its really gotten me down lately but Im trying to remind myself that its still early and hopefully when Im healed and drop some weight the results will really shine. The gland is definitely gone but I could stand to shed about lbs. I kinda bulked too hard preop since I was going to be out of the gym a while. ,gynecomastia,d5axu5x,1,t5_2sq54
8274202,0,t3_4ssvx3,Hi from looking at your pictures its pretty clear you have bilateral gynecomastia. How bad it is however is purely subjective if its affecting you to such an extend that you want it rectifying then Id say its time time have a proper talk with your parents and go to see a doctor to get things moving!,gynecomastia,d5bu12t,1,t5_2sq54

9181522,0,t3_5618gd,Yeah of course its possible they are two different tissues.  Gyno goes away on its own you never created a energy deficit long term so the fat is still there.,gynecomastia,d8ftq88,1,t5_2sq54

9989001,0,t1_db98jd3,No he should go to the doc that prescribed him the finasteride ASAP. I would be very cautious about taking something that is known to cause hair loss because you are taking something to combat hair loss which is the reason why you are taking something causes the hair loss. savvy,gynecomastia,db9len6,1,t5_2sq54

11259601,0,t3_60kfnq,My most important tip is that you buy a laxative miralax BEFORE your surgery and take it every day for the first  days starting after you get home. The anesthesia and your pain meds will cause constipation like nothing youve ever had before. By day  the waste buildup was probably more uncomfortable than the chest recovery. Especially since youll want to make sure you are eating well after surgery.Stay hydrated and dont ignore this warning.,gynecomastia,df89c1m,3,t5_2sq54
