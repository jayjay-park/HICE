3503590,0,t3_304g2l,Honestly Im not sure. My ENT gave me a hearing test which showed hearing loss. He followed up with tests measuring inner ear pressure and ear drum plasticity. The inner ear pressure was slightly out of normal range. He prescribed a low sodium diet I shoot for mgday likely around  which actually reduced the worst aspects of the tinnitus and my week followup hearing test showed improved hearing. Tinnitus got slightly worse though not as bad as before and he put me on Dyazide. The T did not get better but it also hasnt gotten any worse. Would that have happened with the Dyazide? No clue. But I take it anyway just in case.,Menieres,cprmu5y,1,t5_2vvml
4368673,0,t3_3asnd3,I have bruxism but also menieres disease my ent used some tech goggles to track my eye tracking it shows how well your inner ear on both sides tracks head movement. With MD its likely that you will have impaired eye tracking might be worth checking out. ,Menieres,csi31ju,1,t5_2vvml

5712885,0,t3_3taoym,I got  shots in my left ear a week between shots. Im not going to lie this shit was like hell fire in my head. It was easily the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. BUT... As it turns out my one and only allergy is this medication. So that was a shitty revelation.  Despite those terrible few weeks of recovery I have never had another large attack since  years ago this month The only down side is the hearing I have lost from the injections will never come back. Which doesnt bug me at all. ,Menieres,cx58mjw,1,t5_2vvml

8346619,0,t3_4tvj2r,Sorry you are having a rough one. Just remember that itll pass. Have you ever tried sleeping with white noise app on? It blocks people and tinnitus out. It took a few days to get use to it but now it saves me on the rough nights. Its super calming I find. ,Menieres,d5kvpjd,2,t5_2vvml

10369772,0,t3_5o0sd1,My tinnitus has been around for as long as I can remember. I never realized how present it was until I happened to talk to a coworker about it and found that through my whole life I had been mentally excusing away the ringinghissing sound. I thought everything made the sound its the sound of a speaker when no sound is coming the monitor or TV is making the sound its the sound water makes as it goes through pipes its the sound of an AC vent and when I was somewhere there was nothing to blame it on its just the sound an overactive brain makes. The dizziness would come on spontaneously like you described but Id also dismiss it as turning my head too fast or getting up too quickly which by the way is not normal if you get dizzy from standing up you may have a heart problem. My biggest issue was a sharp stabbing headache at the top of my head quickly followed by cold pouring sweating tunnel vision nausea and dizziness. The best way I could describe my dizziness is like watching one of those GoPro videos with a VR headset I suddenly felt detached from my body. Or another way to put it its like the helmet cam that is filming the wearers face and their head remains center and stable while everything else moves all around them. ,Menieres,dcjh4s3,2,t5_2vvml
10484729,0,t3_5p9ngr,I cant say for sure if you have Menieres but I have almost exactly the same symptoms as you. The difference is I have had probably  throughout my life extremely severe vertigo attacks going back to when I was  years old. It would always happen in bed and they assumed it was BPPV. Back in December my ears started ringing never happened before and I have persistent but slowly improving vertigo. The ear ringing is maddening but after a month I am learning to deal with it the vertigo just causes me to be so foggy and fatigued all the time. I have not been diagnosed with Menieres for what its worth. I had an MRI done to check for tumors I would suggest doing this to clear your head if you can afford it and irregularities on my nerves. They found that I have too thin of a bone structure next to my inner ear and they think that could be causing it but surgery is too risky given the symptoms are not destroying my life. My ENT finally told me hes at a loss for what else to do and to check back in  months. Stay strong man I feel for you. Im  and have other chronicprogressive conditions that Ive been able to mentally move past this one is really bringing me down and making me feel hopeless. I hope your symptoms improve!  ,Menieres,dcwjx27,1,t5_2vvml
