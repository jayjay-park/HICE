10007179,0,t3_5iwc27,There wasnt any huge marketing push either which I appreciate. No relabeling of the frikken empire symbol to sell Tshirts. No rehashing of the identical old story. This movie was fresh and legit to its roots.  ,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbbypqf,11,t5_3e3g8

10023919,0,t1_dbe4ina,I think the only way it could have been darker is if Vader was the one to kill Jyn and Cassian. It would have been fitting but would be scary for the little kids and Vaders appearance would be harder to cheer for. With him just killing a bunch of Rebel cannon fodder the audience can more easily ignore the violence as hes not killing anyone important. ,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbe57qm,2,t5_3e3g8
10041348,0,t1_dbd20wq,only complaint i have is there were too few rebel soldiers...should have been  and he just slaughters them all mercilessly,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbgex0j,1,t5_3e3g8
10043204,0,t3_5jdal4,Funny I thought it was the other way around. Tarkin was good but not perfect.. Leia was spot on.,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbgnloo,1,t5_3e3g8

10063873,0,t3_5jd0d5,The senate was still a thing at this point and she was a senator. She knew he knew he knew she knew he knew but he cant just go murdering a senator for having plans to an illegal superweapon that the senate didnt know about. She kept up the facade as long as it made sense to give the rebels time to mount a strike and he was bound by a bit of politics and the need to get the plans back. ,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbjchdb,2,t5_3e3g8

10140183,0,t1_dbt8zgb,He could but I am not sure whether they can override manual controls from command post. Besides Tarkin is ruthless and cunning above anything else. He knew there was security breach in project Stardust and he cannot be sure whether emperor replaces his masterpiece with something else and probably executes him on a spot so he destroys a his rival b a lot of other competing projects stored on data drives which can be conveniently destroyed if they will be reclaimed c rebel forces on planet which number anywhere between  to  men with air support for all he knows from inaccurate reports.Its like trying to kill a fly with Davy Crockett rocket launcher... and taking Spetsznasz commando and supporting Hind with it.,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbt9qjr,5,t5_3e3g8
10172132,0,t3_5llnyo,The weirdest part of his story for me was when that alien mind warped him or whatever. He was a little loopy in the cell but then immediately was better again and no one ever talked about it again... ,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dbx2fgo,10,t5_3e3g8
10503727,0,t3_5kijri,I am with you here. I turned to my wife right after they definitely showed Sean William scotts face and said was that stifler?She didnt think so but no joke she immediately asked when the move ended if I had noticed ludicrous in one of the scenes. I didnt  but im glad to have found this Reddit post so I know were not alone.,Star_wars_Rogue_One,dcypj5i,1,t5_3e3g8
