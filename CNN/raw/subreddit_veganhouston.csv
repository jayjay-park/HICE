5837947,0,t1_cxkuorh,rvegan would give a food video like this around  upvotes but it doesnt have any chance of hitting  upvotes. Most people are much less likely to click on a video than they are an image or gif so if  the dish was shown as something like that it could probably get more attention. Generally posts that are just showing off how to make food still wont blow up on rvegan. If she got a big TV deal if a major company started selling one of her dishes or if some big celebrity raved about her food then it could get a lot of attention on rvegan. This still would get mostly upvotes on rvegan though and it is pretty well made. I dont want to discourage anyone from submitting things like this!,veganhouston,cxkvraq,4,t5_2t93j
