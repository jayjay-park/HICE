As for the map uTimoCT linked you should be wary of the accuracy of it as it is fan made. If you want to make sure you get the features right Id suggest going through the books to pinpoint them as best as you can. Heres am official map from the Fever Crumb era. If you want help making a map Id be glad to read through the books and check. As for programming Im learning Python and Java so if that helps in any way feel free to ask.Edit this and this will help too. In the second one Im pretty sure the hunting ground extends into Asia and all the way to the Himalayas so thats an inaccuracy but otherwise seems good.,MortalEngines,d5hz3ez,1,t5_2u6rt
