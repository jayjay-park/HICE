2399309,0,t1_cm89613,Unfortunately the Department of Education doesnt care if you live on your own when it comes to dependency status.  This chart gives you the criteria to be considered independent.  You only have to meet one of the criteria in the list to be an independent student.  If you dont meet any of the criteria but have some other circumstances documented abuse or domestic violence committed by your parent as an example that you think may qualify you as an independent student you can talk to your schools financial aid office about a possible dependency override.,financialaid,cm89goc,3,t5_2ul5t

3255640,0,t1_coz3qkp,What do you mean by postmarked? Im in high school and I gave my school the GPA verification this week and their supposed to be sending it. The thing that has my attention is what happens if they receive the GPA verification late? Does it still get processed or not?For instance if it was sent this week but they received the verification a bit late then does it still get processed? Im checking the CSAC website and so far about a day ago it says that they havent received my GPA verification yet.,financialaid,cozghrl,1,t5_2ul5t

5531075,0,t3_3quzoc,If you werent making satisfactory academic progress when you left then youll still be on that status when you returned. You will only regain eligibility for aid when you manage to get yourself back above the GPA requirement or the completion requirement. If I understand you correctly that your plan is to pay out of pocket for this term and then for the next term use financial aid yes you should be able to do that. After your grades are posted for the next term your financial aid office should run whatever internal process it has to recognize that you now are making satisfactory academic progress so you can now be packaged for aid.Probably be worthwhile to talk to your FA office at your institution. How quickly you can do it on a tight schedule depends on how they handle these situations.,financialaid,cwin685,2,t5_2ul5t

6526112,0,t1_czu9ij3,Your question still doesnt make sense to me because the Department of Education takes the information you put on the FAFSA processes it essentially checks to see if the tax information adds up correctly if your social security numbers match the names you gave et cetera and then sends it only to the schools you indicated you wanted to receive the information. The information you give does not under any circumstances go to the schools that you dont want it sent to. So unless you made a deliberate choice to have that data sent to the school your siblings attend then it would be absolutely impossible for that school to make a new residency determination for them based on your application for financial aid.,financialaid,czuconl,1,t5_2ul5t

10055862,0,t3_5jbtnw,If you are not enrolled for the term the loans you accepted will not disburse to you.

10259971,0,t3_5mwn24,Are you waiting to hear back about your expected financial contribution EFC from FAFSA waiting on your financial aid award letter or your actual financial aid disbursement? It really depends on where in the process you are. If you are waiting on a disbursement youre likely fine. Aid often isnt disbursed until after you begin attendance. As long as you have done everything you need for the aid youre good. If it is either of the first two talk to your aid office today to see what is needed so that you can meet the deadline.,financialaid,dc70v5y,2,t5_2ul5t

10787212,0,t3_5ua07i,Schools can only facilitate loans for the type of degree they provide. I am a financial aid rep at a two year college we can only facilitate undergraduate loans because we only offer undergraduate degrees. Are you sure youve maxed out your loans  for under grad? If so your option is out of pocket or private loans or pay off your current debt to be eligible for undergraduate loans again.,financialaid,ddsmfwy,1,t5_2ul5t

11758434,0,t1_dgsuhne,Read the link. It is exactly what Im saying the parents and family members should be required to pay. Theres a solution it would be wage garnishment from the parents. If parents or family refuse to pay the EFC the government needs to garnish their wages. It shouldnt be the students responsibility to force their parents to pay. Im not saying tax payers should pay Im saying that FAFSA needs to enforce the EFC by garnishing wages. ,financialaid,dgsujts,1,t5_2ul5t
