211615,0,t1_cex03ii,I actually like this idea about time travel not being something we can controlthough I see Im a little late for this thread. Im a little less hot on the idea of the portal that can open up time it just seems a bit cliche. An interesting thought would be for this main character every time something good was about to happen in his life he gets transported into a random moment in time. Then suddenly for no reason this changes and he rediscovers his lust for life. Just throwing it out there. Time travel can be used as a means of showing the human element in him.,ShootMyShort,cf2jq6h,1,t5_2zvax
