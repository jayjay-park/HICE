6292443,0,t3_41sp8x,I like this meal because every ingredient is a pantry item or a vegetable with a long storage life. It is a great decadent and cheap meal on the days you have nothing in the house and no money to spend!The link leads to the peasant bread which is pretty easy to make I make this recipe halved all the time and it works fine. The recipe for the lentil potato soup is this cup RED lentils cups water  cup onion I use one medium onion tbsp olive oil tsp cumin  cups cubed potatoes about  smallish potatoes  tsp of salt  cups vegetable stock cup of lemon juiceblack pepper to serveTo make the soup. Rinse the lentils then cook them with the water in a pot bring to a boil reduce heat and cover while you saute everything else. Dice the onions then saute them over medium heat in your soup pot for  minutes with the olive oil and cumin. . While your onions are cooking peel and dice your potatoes. Add them to the soup pot with the salt and cook for an additional  minutes. Stir frequently the onions may scorch to the pot and this isnt bad it adds flavour to the soup. Add the cooked lentils and the vegetable stock and simmer for another  minutes until your bread is done. Before serving stir in the lemon juice. Some cilantro might be nice if you have it on hand but it is not necessary.This recipe works really well with the recipe for the peasant bread. Start prep on the peasant bread a couple of hours before you serve prep only takes a few minutes of measuring and mixing. You can start baking the bread as soon as you make the soup. The bread recipe has you baking it at  minutes for one temperature and I normally just use my timer for that to gauge my time for sauteing the soup veggies. When the bread is done cooling the soup is ready to serve and they go well together with buttermargarineolive oil dip for the bread.FYI for those without large pots. The soup calls for  cups water but a lot boils off so you dont need a large stock pot I have one that hold  cups and it works fine.,budgetveggie,cz4vozj,3,t5_2vwwo
