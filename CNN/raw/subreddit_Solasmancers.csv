2752802,0,t1_cngz467,Ive seen the fade lets see... in the harrowing in DAO in the mage circle in DAO in connors mind in DAO in Feynriels mind in DA... every. single. time. Ssme shitty spires. It is true that theres demons everywhere. But the fact that theres demons everywhere seems to indicate that maybe the fade is just mostly shitty and filled with demons.I actually find the Solas scene kind of interesting because its the only time the fade has ever successfully replicated an actual place. I think he remarks something about it too that your dreams are unusually vivid potentially because of the anchor. ,Solasmancers,cngzdd5,3,t5_35qex

2788820,0,t1_cnl2mux,Well think about your joining in Origins. Out of the three potentials one is a coward and the other is a criminal. Now if they didnt die you would be giving them the power of the taint and a sword and letting them loose with the powers of conscription and whatnot. The Grey Warden system is inherently slanted towards giving people at the lowest rungs of society whether they are there through crime or through happenstance like our Hero of Ferelden incredible physical power and crazy conscription rites. Thats going to be dangerous. When you have power it behooves you to act responsibly. Even when youre scared. Thats the point of having power. If you have power and you cannot act responsibly when youre scared that power needs to be taken away. Hence why the wardens need to be stopped. Its worth it to note that Solas isnt the only one who argues for the wardens to be let go. Hawke is also firmly against the wardens as is Cassandra and Cole. Cole is perhaps the most telling since he can directly see inside of peoples heads at what moves them. ,Solasmancers,cnl2uyd,2,t5_35qex

2815926,0,t1_cno59yd,You have to be incredibly awkward with Cullens romance. Im awkward enough in real life I dont need my video game character being awkward for me. The long weird pauses are funny but they usually arent the character Im playing.Its weird because DAI has this odd line where they want to define the Inquisitors character but they also dont. So the inquisitor to me comes off as a generic slate most of the time with these really strange character quirks depending on who I romance who I talk to and what missions I do. My inquisitor isnt awkward at all unless I choose to romance Cullen.I thought Alistair was really the most solid overall romance Ive ever seen in a game because there was a lot of give and take discussion and because it developed with a sensible pacing over time. Alistair is even the one to invite you into bed! ,Solasmancers,cno5w9n,1,t5_35qex

2900351,0,t1_cnxrlet,I actually think that might be why I hate vivienne so much. Shes absolutely gorgeous and her voice is amazing and yet shes so awful. I want to rivalmance her and then break up with her. Ser Barris is pretty awesome remember to send him on his war table missions! I tried templars once the mission is more fun with Cole running around but my canon is always mages... not just because I think they need support but also because I get extra Cullen missions instead of extra Leliana missions that way. I think asia literally doesnt exist in Thedas which is... interesting. I sort of wonder if they kind of forgot about asians. LOL. Because none of their lead writers are asian. DAI is strangely lacking in orgies and brothels. I guess Bioware didnt want to get the flack for a brothel but honestly brothels were kind of a middle ages staple and theres nothing inherently wrong with a progressive egalitarian brothel... or witcher  stole all the brothels and all the power held within.I find it HILARIOUS. Because you know... inquisitor. The inquisitor just running around flirting with people and then being called the herald of andraste. I imagine Cassandras reaction and it makes me laugh hysterically.,Solasmancers,cnxrxdh,1,t5_35qex

3144256,0,t3_2vnlad,Im already on that bandwagon.Pretty sure the Dalish have the history wrong on his account entirely and because the Keepers are the ones that control what their people learn theyre the ones spreading the misinformation.The current Keepers probably arent aware of that being what they are doing but the original ones that started it did. Im also of the thought that the term Keeper was originally Keeper of the Slaves so the Keepers were in tight with the mastersWith everyone segregated the way they are the easier it is to control what they know.,Solasmancers,conwduj,2,t5_35qex

5640284,0,t1_cwvkwhb,No you didnt scare me off I got sick over the weekend and was trying to recover and rest.  Sadly Im still sick but at least I can breath.Yes sometimes people just want to bitch at Bioware.  First their choices dont matter then they matter too much!  Ha ha.  Everyone has their opinions.Im doing a lot of work on that character and Ive thought through so many aspects of her personality its kind of embarrassing.   I feel like I really ought to write about her to justify all the leg work Ive done!It is so sad that he still doesnt see Lavellan as a complete person.   That look he gives her when she asks that just wrecks me.   If you have really low approval with Solas he talks to you just like he talks to Varric in that scene.   He really hated my male Qunari and at one point he gets an option to punch Solas.   That was my least favorite character to play though.  Only Lavellan gets to punch the Egg and then only after he dumps her...or leaves her the second time!I kind of wondered what the Sentinals were up to after leaving Mythals temple.  After that mission it looks like some show up at Skyhold for my Lavellan who drank from the well I headcanon them joining her almost like a personal guard but youre right they are awfully uppity like Solas.  I saw a thing about personality types in different fictional works.  If I can drum up the link Ill send it to you.  Some of my favorite fandoms were on there.  Sorry that youre feeling down these days.  We moved out here a year ago and its been tough making friends.  We know a few people but its rare to find people with the same interests out in the midde of nowhere.  Whenever I feel like that I go get a Solas hug from that link over in the sub.  That and rewatch his little Trespasser saunter.  Its why Ive seen it so many times!    wiggles eyebrows,Solasmancers,cww8cbf,1,t5_35qex
7453449,0,t3_4h92dt,I think a knight enchanter specd mage has the greatest potential to be badass.

7509288,0,t3_4h92dt,I also just finished my first play through of the game and spoiled the dlc for myself I was so heartbroken  that ending was so bittersweet ! Yes I just saved the world but the only person I wanted to celebrate with wasnt there!!!  So sad!But imagine if the only thing to save Inquisitor from dying would be to elevate her to God status or to make her immortal like Corypheaus was! and then herself and Solas could rebuild the Elven back to what they once were.... If i replay the game Ill see all the hints that Solas was giving throughout the game about his temporary staying  the first thing he says to you is that he was doubtful of staying!SPOILERWell throughout the game also he removes your tattoos to make you less like the lower slave elf and more like the higher godlike ones in power. He also asks you what you would do with power when bestowed on you and responds best to the option when you say you want to restore what once was....Id so love that to actually happen and I hope Im not reading too much into it but I just really want to see true love prevail!!!!!!,Solasmancers,d2vro5u,1,t5_35qex
8123176,0,t1_d3r54nq,I am coming to this late but Ive been enchanted by the music in Trespasser lately and your post gave me some new insight. Ive been researching to try and find some analysis of the Lost Elf Theme as well as to me it reads very strongly as a love theme. The longing of the strings and the chattering of the instruments. I found this at some point  I wish I knew more about music theory than I do but especially as a fan analysis this is an interesting bit of evidence to further your point. Its thesis is essentially that the Lost Elf Theme is a musical portrait of Solass romance with Lavellan. Her analysis as the piano as the ticking of the clock is especially on point.Ive played this game a few times each with a different romance and while many will argue that there is no intentional canon playthrough I would argue that whether it was intentional or not when you experience the Solavellan playthrough the plot and narrative underpinnings of Dragon Age Inquisition take on an entirely different shape. This doesnt happen with any of the other romances and each of them comes to an easy closure that Solavellan simply cannot achieve. For me thats an enormous tell for the importance of the Solas romance. The longform arc as well comprises a new coherence and sense of purpose when the elven heroine falls in love with the elven god who turns out to be the essential villain. I mean wow. In this playthrough the story of Dragon Age Inquisition becomes above all a love story. I like your analysis of the Thedas love theme and I do think theres something to it. The score especially in a game like this is an important part of the storytelling process. Im working on a longer piece right now that in part makes the argument that Dragon Age Inquisition is best played as a love story. A very old love story the lion and the lamb the vampire and the slayer Zues and the mortal. Like I said whether the epic love story angle was intentional or not there is no way that a writer like Patrick Weekes doesnt see this or understand the narrative tropes hes treading in. These are the same tropes that have fueled the popularity of works like Twilight Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Vampire Diaries. So essentially while I agree that and understand why Bioware would prefer everyone think their romance is canon the truth is that no romance will ever feel canon quite like the one between the elven mortal heroine and her elven god nemesis.,Solasmancers,d4t4932,2,t5_35qex
