Disable the DHCP on the other house routers and connect to a LAN port on them or use the configure as access point function in the routers. Look at Ubiquiti Edgerouter or Mikrotik or even an older Cisco router off eBay. All would be more than stable enough.

Except when the ACL is defined as a routemap it can then be used in conjunction with the NAT command to specify a source address translation based on the traffic destination.One thing to be careful of is the processing order and where you apply that NAT policy.If you apply it to the site routers the process is routing NAT crypto. So the address will be translated BEFORE it applies the cryptomap and if your cryptomap looks for traffic with a source address in the local subnet the translated addresses wont match and will not be encapsulated. Thus you would need your VPN policies configured for your translated addresses.,networking,cetcugc,5,t5_2qkaf

470779,0,t1_cfts29a,ampampamp Teredo tunneling sfw gtgtIn computer networking Teredo is a transition technology that gives full IPv connectivity for IPvcapable hosts which are on the IPv Internet but which have no direct native connection to an IPv network. Compared to other similar protocols its distinguishing feature is that it is able to perform its function even from behind network address translation NAT devices such as home routers.gtTeredo operates using a platform independent tunneling protocol designed to provide IPv Internet Protocol version  connectivity by encapsulating IPv datagram packets within IPv User Datagram Protocol UDP packets. These datagrams can be routed on the IPv Internet and through NAT devices. Other Teredo nodes elsewhere called Teredo relays that have access to the IPv network then receive the packets unencapsulate them and route them on.gtTeredo is designed as a last resort transition technology and is intended to be a temporary measure in the long term all IPv hosts should use native IPv connectivity. Teredo should therefore be disabled when native IPv connectivity becomes available.gtTeredo was developed by Christian Huitema at Microsoft and was standardized in the IETF as RFC . The Teredo server listens on UDP port .gtInteresting IPv | Network address translation | Teredo genus Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcftsfw oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecftsfw.

473209,0,t1_cfu1bh3,OK.  Ill play along and splithairs with you.Academically within the specific usage scenario presented here I acknowledge that a Mbit hub should fire multicast traffic at the segment roughly as fast as a similar Mbit switch would.Now my turn.  Replace that  Hub with any port   Switch and reevaluate your position.We could quibble over whether or not the image server can sustain a full Gigabit transfer rate.  Probably not sustaining a full gigabit over the typical GB image file is no easy feat.  But pretty much any semimodern PC or laptop can sustain several hundred megabits indefinitely.So under the premise that we are comparing a Mbit hub vs a Gigabit switch Im confident the switched solution will win.I stand behind my previous statementI cant honestly think of a single situation where a hub is a better option than a switch.,networking,cfu21k5,2,t5_2qkaf

531408,0,t3_207uor,I cant speak for Meru but IME with Ruckus if you dont pay top dollar for their kit you run into odd problems here and there that are near dealbreakers. Were using two ZDs which just got their last firmware update along with a mix of ZFs and ZFs. At times the controllers will not see eachother or will failover while the other is still accessible. APs will randomly start blackholing traffic and need to be hard reset weve RMAed a couple and the issue has reoccurred with the replacements. Does not happen with any other brand AP on the same switch. Handoff while roaming sometimes takes up to a minute or doesnt happen at all and requires reconnecting to the SSID. The APs are picky about what they receive PoE from. We put in a few Procurve PoEs and the Ruckuses would not power up. Every other PoE device we tried even higher consumption devices worked fine.Overall I think Ruckus is pretty nice if you have the exorbitant amount of money their quality kit requires. For my IT department on a limited budget purchasing their solution was shortsighted. Were stuck with a bunch of outdated APs that we cant afford to upgrade. I cant wait until we migrate to Ubiquiti.I will say though that configuration is very straightforward and when none of the problems I listed are occurring the APs work nicely.,networking,cg0of7n,2,t5_2qkaf

I would say the outlook really depends on where you are located and the infrastructure in place. It also largely depends on if your team knows what they are doing.  We have been very successful we can provide up to Gbps wireless microwave links which are just as reliable as copper or fiber for a fraction of the cost of a leased line or running your own fiber.  That said we are also moving into the fiber side but mostly as a backhaul for the wireless radios.  The upside to wireless microwave is that it can be deployed quickly we can get a link up the same day if you need it that fast. You can also get to remote places that the big companies dont want to waste millions of  to connect lt people in a remote small town or neighborhood.  I would say the outlook is pretty good really the only options for a high speed link is either fiber or wireless. If you can afford it I would always recommend fiber first if your budget is tight or you need something up while you lay the fiber or you want a backup for when someone digs up your fiber wireless is the way to go.

The Cisco  series switches has models that is  of the total ports to be PoE enabled has Fast Ethernet ports that fits your criteria and a Managed Switch web based. Price wise the Cisco business  series switches is cost effective. However if you need an IOS based switch for more management options. The Cisco S or X are IOS based. However they are all Gigabit models already and maybe overkill based on your budget. You can also look into the Cisco  Plus for Fast Ethernet models IOS based switch that is a bit affordable.

805790,0,t3_23b23k,I start with a story about a Cisco  switch.Once upon a time there was a stingy CEO who needed a core switch with L capabilities to sit in his rack.Purchase a Cisco  the Sysadmin said.NO! said the cheap SOB.  We will purchase this  that has   ports. It has the same Packets Per Second PPS forwarding rate and it is thousands of dollars cheaper.But! said the Sysadmin That switch is designed for data closets where workstation computers connect and traffic speeds only rarely reach sustained gigabit speeds. But the Cheap SOB would hear none of it  and so it was done.The switch was installed in the cabinet and a SAN and VMware host were connected to it. Traffic from many dozens of users converged on that switch.  That switch routed between voice amp data VLANS maintained SAN backplane communication and worked really hard.  This switch was in a cooled server room that never even had any heat issues.  And for many years things were fine. But this isnt the story that ends with happily ever after.  Oh no!The storage networks would fall out of sync with each other VMware was slowing down.Its the switch said the Sysadmin Im certain of it.But the SHOW INTERFACE commands dont show problems said Cheap SOB how can this be?Welp... said the Sysadmin while slapping hands down on his knees The blinking amber lights on the uplink ports are telling me a different story! he said in his best voice that tried but failed to hide contempt. I need to schedule downtime.Can it wait for the weekend? asked Cheap SOB?Many words were had. But before the Sysadmin could fully regain his composure  fate had intervened.The system was down!DURING PRODUCTION HOURS!They hastily put in an HP Procurve and moved the patch cables.  The Cisco  was removed from the rack.Rattle rattle went the switch.  Switches arent supposed to rattle.Sysadmin took the cover off the switch  to see that the heatsinks on the switch had severe discoloration due to extreme overheating.  The nylon clips that held the heatsink in place had been baked for so long that they became brittle and broke.  Those nylon clips held the heat sinks down by springs.  Springloaded push pins as they are called. The brittle nylon wasnt designed to sustain temperatures above c.  When the nylon snapped springs sprung.Shortcircuit.jpgOverheating.jpgSysadminFuming.jpgCheabSOBCrying.jpgOnce again going cheap wound up costing many thousands of dollars more than had they simply purchased the right tool for the job.The moral of the storyTLDR Usse the right tool for the job.,networking,cgvverl,1,t5_2qkaf

Cat posed similar problems as well.Perport seems to work fine for Cat in my experience.As uznk points out the correctness of your ACL depends on the intended direction of the traffic flow when you are marking it.I believe best practice is to classify amp mark on ingress at the edge of your network.  So as soon as the packet exits the source device and enters your initial LAN device apply the policy to classify amp mark.  Your traffic controls policing shaping whatever can happen then as well or on egress if you want.If you apply this strategy throughout your network the return traffic should get markedclassifiedcontrolled using the same basic policies when it exits the farend device and reenters the LAN environment on that side of the conversation.There are a great many correct ways to do all of this of course.Great examples here,networking,che8g23,3,t5_2qkaf

Yes yes half the world and ping  ms.Sometimes the traffic might go through USA it depends.Why this happens? Well basically the Tier  depeers the network which does not comply with new fees and the traffic goes on the next shortest path which having  major networks probably no other because Tier  traffic is really expensive.In Europe Ive yet to notice this with internet providers basically they exchange on the IX points without any problems. But Mobile operators particularly Vodafone tend to send the service through other networks and also HTTP traffic through their proxies the latter is allowed through contract with customer but the other network sending is usually due to bad peering contracts.The Fast lanes most describe here work already without any problems and DO NOT CORRESPOND TO NET NEUTRALITY.Moreover without SLA they have no obligation to keep the network speed and traffic inline.They can put it into the contracts without problems and youll have free access to facebook as well.,networking,chjtf4t,0,t5_2qkaf

Even I wouldnt want to deal with that mess. Pull Ethernet for this its not that expensive. Contention ratio is touchy feely. Are your tenants just using Gmail and such? Do they host their own mail servers? Web servers? MMOGaming server!? The more they do the less contention. For just basic internet something like a Mbps MetroE could provide a Mbps service for all your tenants no problem. It just depends on how utilized it will be maybe more maybe less.Pricewise well that just depends. I have rural towers with Mbps fiber costing  while urban sites are a third that price. Usually  year contracts with some sort of nominal k or so install fee. So if you have  tenants willing to pay  a month for dedicated Internet you might be able to offer Mbps Service with a Mbps line in a good Metro area.Legally your transit ISP will give you a TOS which youll just pass along to your tenants as your buildings TOS. As long as you respond to all the legal paperwork its no big deal. Ive never had problems in that area. Just make sure you have a good access point that doesnt trample through your tenants office.

Com c  bit ISA cards in everything.It was pretty neat I do remember that.  The thinnet seemed like a bit of a pain but when it worked it was pretty neat.Nothing back then was as reliable as it is now.

The office is all ran through same hardware with no separate satellite cable or other connections.

1635900,0,t3_2cw1ij,Maybe Im a little late but pfSense is mentioned with high IRQ load. Sometimes on older equipment and with old FreeBSD which pfSense is put on top of IRQ storms can happen. On older PCI hardware there were only really  IRQ lines going out to PCI and so controllers need to do trickery to handle more. Very often the motherboard manufacturer latched onboard equipment onto IRQ lines that are also used for other things. It doesnt usually break things but it means that IRQ routing has to be optimal and drivers has to be optimally written to handle it. This also means multiple drivers need to be consulted to figure out exactly which card is requesting an interrupt and when a device does not have a driver attached it will continuously request interrupts. In this case it might be something as simple as an USB controller that isnt serviced properly and its hardwired to the same PCI IRQ as the LAN card. Happened to me a lot when trying to roll out pre PCI Express software based network equipment no matter what OS the problem is the same. I wouldnt be surprised if just moving the lan card to a different PCI slot or disabling some unused onboard equipment with or without resetting BIOS to repopulate ACPI tables might do the trick.,networking,cjldc20,1,t5_2qkaf

While with a serverboard that will always be a front to back airflow which gives that you need to reposition hot parts.So even if you can fit a desktop board in your serverchassi I would say there is a higher probability of it overheating compared to an equal serverboard due to its internal design of where various parts are placed on the board.,networking,cjpuo1u,1,t5_2qkaf

1916783,0,t3_2gky2b,It depends. All kinds of interesting things can happen on Layer  switches! Factors that influence the behaviour include port configuration features enabled on the switch and the type of traffic youre running.For example  Unknown unicast flooding can occur on ports that are not fixed within a specific VLAN by default such as trunk ports. Dynamic multiVLAN and trunk ports can all have packets show up from another VLAN when the switch doesnt know where to find a given destination MAC.  Layer  features on the CPU SP or RP if equipped will have impact system wide. So say your LAB SVI for some reason is hammered with IP TTL packets or something interesting causes softwareswitched flows... other SVI forwarding can bite the dust  Layer  snooping features can do this as well. Excessive IGMP joinsleaves can cause this sort of problem.These are just examples of problems that can cause high CPU utilization. A  load caused by traffic anywhere will impact the entire box. Now in a L switch there is a lot of work done in hardware so not all features will be impacted by high CPU load but if theres anything at all running spanning tree for example youll be out of luck. This is a big reason youll see online Control Plan Policing CoPP for L switches in production. Boxes like the Cat  can limit the rate at which certain packets hit the Route Processor in order to avoid situations like these.My advice is that if you think there exists the possibility of something like that happening you need physical separation.

You can redistribute it with a higher or lower metric if you want.Also E routes actually do calculate metric to the ASBR it is called the forward metric which you can see if you do show ip route .... The forward metric is the distance to the ASBR that originated the E route.If a router hears about an E route from two different OSPF neighbors it will look at the forward metric before deciding which one of them to install. It will pick the one with the lowest forward metric because that route has the shortest path to the ASBR.gtThe key difference is that E is always preferred over E followed by the E route with the lower redistribution metric. If multiple E routes exist with the same redistribution metric the path with the lower forward metric metric to the ASBR is preferred. If there are multiple E routes with both the same redistribution metric and forward metric they can both be installed in the routing table.,networking,cl45xg8,12,t5_2qkaf

2476644,0,t1_cmhtl2r,Right so theres a couple of points to raise on that...Firstly those timers work elsewhere. I dont like them but I have to live with them because thats an argument I had and lost.With BFD turned on with default timers it was considerably worse. Many many time outs. It was almost as though the control packets were being issued by the CPU rather than the interface card. I suspect thats accurate for the SRX.The links were all Gig or better I.e. bond and never ever more than  full th ile typically lt utilised. The box had almost no config installed just some simple QoS and a few OSPF and BGP neighbors.Reconvergence of  prefixes with largely identical NLRI data on show BGP summary completed in a couple of seconds. It could take up to  minutes for that to be a reality presumably the FIB programming was either slow or stalled.Now upgrading to something in .X helped a lot but we never quite trusted them again. They were being used as branch edge not production traffic and on at least three occasions we had them just die needing a reboot because logging in over console and resetting BGP neighborships would take too long versus having someone yank power.Even in packet mode for MPLS they were just not reliable enough to consider usable in any semblance of a production environment.The MX series are fantastic. I love them to bits. The switching and security products that Juniper have built not ScreenOS that was bought not built are just too risky. From what I hear the EX is just a shambles for any of the early adopters and while the EX is quite a nice switch now I was one of the first customers back when their split brain virtual chassis was brain dead.Juniper is a great company for routers. JUNOS is lovely. I just wish they stopped diversifying their product line up.,networking,cmhu1li,1,t5_2qkaf

Stop thinking of it as becoming an evil salesperson and start thinking of it as a personal and career development challenge. Instead of complaining about unknowlegable salespeople who hassle and annoy you focus on changing the mold becoming a person who wins customers over with respect and knowledge has customers who become friends and ring you for advice on how to build their next project or what they need to do in their next budget.Crack that and you will be justly rewarded as good sales people should. ,networking,cn7d4cs,20,t5_2qkaf

3072440,0,t3_2vbp7m,Although your windows DNS server is acting as your local DNS its most likely that it is using a CNAME for the intranet record pointing to a host in a sub domain for which the GTMs are the authoritative server. The SOA record for the sub domain will usually have two name servers listed one in each DC.  GTM devices are high capacity intelligent DNS servers that will be monitoring the BIGIP LTM devices in the data center as well as WAN link status if they have been configured to. When the primary goes down the next time the Local DNS server receives a request to resolve the name it will query the available DNS server for the subdomain and the the GTM will resolve the IP address of the virtual server on the LTM at the other data center. The TTL will be set suitably short to make this transition fairly nondisruptive. This is about the most common F GTMLTM deployment scenario.

SGA allows for simplified network segmentation based on User IdentityRole and allows for secure access and consistent security policies across WiredWireless networks. SGA helps define BYOD policies through security policies based on UserRoleDeviceLocation. The session covers SGA on the Catalyst Switching platforms including converged wiredwireless. The session covers an architectural overview of SGA and benefits of a converged wiredwireless network elements of Cisco TrustSec such as user identification with .x device identification role classification using Security Group Tagging SGT and enforcement using Security Group Access Control List SGACL. We also discuss various SGA deployment use cases in a campus network. This session is for Network Architects PreSales Engineers and Technical Decision Makers.  BRKEWN  Best practices to deploy highavailability in Wireless LAN Architectures  San Francisco   Hours  The proliferation of WiFi enabled devices creates a significant challenge for IT organizations to create the same level of service and support on the wireless network as there currently is on the wired network. The primary goal of this session is to provide design guidance and share best practices around building reliable and highly available Wireless LAN networks. This session will review wireless design architectures including the Centralized FlexConnect and Converged Access Deployment models. Best practices and design guidance will be provided to achieve high availability for all components of the Cisco Wireless LAN network including APs RRM WLC etc. This session is applicable for attendees responsible for the design deployment operations and management of highly available Wireless LAN Networks.

Many of the concepts challenges and strategies discussed in this session can be applied to high density networks in general however this session has a focus on the sports and entertainment market. The attendee will get detailed information on the use of various required features such as RF profiles and how they are used to address common challenges within these environments. Other topics will include WiFi network consolidation network application analysis with AVC interference detecting and finding as well as commonly seen interference sources client issues and much more.  BRKRST  QoS Design for Wireless LANs  San Francisco   Mins  This session will focus on endtoend QoS design for Wireless LANs. First we will explore the underlying PHY and MAC layer principles of WLAN QoS including IEEE .e and WMM. Next we will look at a systematic approach to designing endtoend QoS across the WLAN including the littleknown impact CAPWAP QoS has on the underlying IP network. This session will include a discussion how Cisco Wireless LAN controllers can be configured to support differentiated levels of service for mixed use WLANs that use a variety of multimedia applications. This will involve a discussion of QoS tools such as perSSID and peruser session controls as well as wirelessbased Application Visibility and Control AVC. We will examine in detail how a systematic design approach can deliver a bestinclass user experience for UC applications like Microsoft Lync and Cisco Jabber.,networking,coity55,6,t5_2qkaf

I heartily recommend the Spamhaus and Emerging Threats lists. uclay also has a link here to many good feeds including a bunch that I have bookmarked.  Be prepared when you implement this to have an expeditious method of whitelisting you WILL run into issues sooner or later no threat feed is perfect.  An important note is that the PAs want the block lists in a specific format.  Might be able to use this to assist not really sure as I dont know Python Some of the links that will follow are to feeds themselves and some are communities or services that will provide a feed behind a registration all free as far as I know.  Some of the feeds will be in special threat intelligence formats like STIXTAXII so be prepared to deal with that and have a way to rip them apart into IP lists.   From the dude behind Snorby designed really to feed into to Bro but Im going to try and shoehorn it into Splunk and my PAs for visibility and enforcement.    STIX formatted TAXII feeds some of which are available in other formats or on clays list.   Open source threat intel repository.  Havent looked at this yet so I cant speak authoritatively to how useful it is.  Looks like its STIXTAXII or Cybox based.    A platform for sharing malware intel.  Less focused on IPs but probably has that info as well.  Will export in STIX XML or JSON so again youll have to pick it apart.   Formerly FSISACs Avalanche.  Very new as a spinoff.  Likely to have a fee at some point but you can sign up and help them test for free now.  Again STIXTAXII.What Im finding is that you have three choices for good threat intelligence.  Paid stuff like Norse.  Widely available basic stuff like the feeds on   and then feeds pulled from open or communitybased threat intel platforms like the ones above.  I think you can get a lot of quality from the platforms but youll need to invest some time and effort into setting them up exporting the data you want and then parsingtransforming it as necessary to feed it into the PAs.If anyone has experience working with these platforms give me a shout Im about to make a foray into this space.,networking,cpdn7dv,2,t5_2qkaf

There are no exceptions to location.. If you expect to have a life dont expect to get promoted very far  you can be decently successful and still own work life balance.  But everyone else is out working you and come review time youre compared to everyone else in the org at your level.  So eventually youll get eaten alive.. The interviews can be brutal by most standards.  Even phone screens are highly technical expect at least  if you do well  is usually a bad sign but not a death sentence.  Be able to troubleshoot very VERY well.  Youre pretty much expected to be able to talk about OSPF LSA types how different stub areas work BGP path selection traffic shifting techniques for routing protocols how TCPIP works flags windowing options etc. they will leave no stone unturned.  The engineers want to know HOW things work.  They know how to put you under pressure during interviews and they do it intentionally if you cant operate under high stress  you wont survive.  Theyll also hit you with soft skills what would you do in this situation how you think etc.  . If you do get an offer negotiate hard up front  they probably wont budge much if youre experience isnt already pretty solid.  Do not expect large raises  for most yearly reviews maybe some stock.  Then  for the MAJOR position jumps.  They use the total compensation model to determine pay so a lot of your salary will be in stock.  Amazon does not do yearly cash bonuses and only sometimes will do signing bonuses for engineers of that level.. They do not care about certifications period.  If those certs help you understand the theory and how networks operate wonderful.  But dont expect more money for becoming the next CCIEx or even a CCIEx.  Show your knowledge and growth in your work and theyll care  but as said in  they still wont give you large raises.. Oncall can be brutal this is not on call where you get to go home and hang out with your family and barely get paged.

Netgear will do cross ship but thats it.  Their tech support is good for RMAs but not much else.Ive read the horror stories.  Ive read of the people who cant trunk and cant get STP to work.

4430956,0,t1_cso4oth,True totally agree. DI may be biased in my descriptions as Ive only seen it done Terribly.By people that didnt understand the difference between BGP and an IGP.Just because you CAN use BGP doesnt mean you SHOULD. If it requires a bit more work to prevent significantly suboptimal routing and you know for a fact that the customer is not going to have a permanent network person on to fix it next time a flaw is found or a workaround is needed really after your  month contract is up then an IGP that was designed to work for your purposes by default or close enough will be a better choice. It all depends on your goals.Other times you might need the power and benefits of BGP and IGP just wont cut it.I have seen a lot of bad idea fairies so my kneejerk reaction is to keep things as simple as possible so theres less chance to muck it up. Of course theres pros and cons  it can be good for scalability purposes but may also prevent me from seeing a more creative solution that would be a better choice. Im always trying to improve though.It is like using pliers to remove a bolt when you have the right size socket wrench and bit designed for the job. But sometimes a pair of pliers works just as good especially if better tools dont exist. Okay I really SHOULD have used an oil filter wrench that time but its not like I was gonna reuse the thing...I look at it this way  in the typical business LAN theres a choice between static and dynamic routing. Most ppl lean towards dynamic but I understand that they might be perfectly happy with statics if they are small and have no need of such things  even though it is nice to be prepared from the beginning so its less painful when you have to scale up later. Like having chicken pox when youre younger  its just less of a hassle and you bounce back faster.Then you have to choose between IGP and EGP  where its less black and white. You have to understand both options to make the right decision but USUALLY people learn IGPs before BGP. For most cases this is fine as both will do the job for the LAN generally. Until it doesnt then its time to dig in with BGP. Will their data centers grow enough to see a benefit from BGP? I have no idea but I doubt it will be any time soon. That would be such a change that I couldnt design for it at this point anyway. Full mesh BGP neighborships would no longer be appropriate etc.HOPEFULLY I havent made a horrible horrible mistake. Hahaha.I WAS worried bout the OTV stuffs since I am not as familiar with data centers yet but if I caused any issues  they havent been discovered yet. And Im more than happy to rollback if they want to bring me back on site and leave IGP only on the Office LAN  DC connects of the MAN ring.I also wonder how great of an idea it was for them to use Nexus devices that had limited routing features as the handoff from DC to Office and from DC to Internet router. I had never seen that before but as I said my experience hasnt been as heavy in DCs.Ive always thought of them as internal DC switches.Its when someone learns BGP before understanding IGPs that things really get interesting which is one of the theories that I like to use to explain the messes Ive seen.Of course you could mess things up by using an IGP where a BGP would be more appropriate but it doesnt happen as often. Or at least I havent seenheard of it personally.But LANs are getting more and more diverse and larger in scale so theres going to be a lot of exceptions that I havent even thought of. Its kind of crazy amazing to think of how much has changed and how perception needs to change with it or get left in the dust! dramaticalityTLDR BGP is great for large scale. For what it was created for. And that could include the LAN label. D,networking,csp7lze,1,t5_2qkaf

Before modern card with autodetect it was the only way two similar equipment could talk together pcpc switchswitch routerrouter. Switches usually had the send and receive opposite those of PCs and routers which meant you could use a straight cable for pc to switch and for switch to router. It also meant you would need a crossover is you didnt use a switch for pc to pc communication.Now  of interfaces support automdix which will detect and swap pairs according to what is needed crossover are not necessary anymore. Inyerfaces running Mbps have this to be able to function most modern Mbps also have this.With automdix you can use straight or crossover without issues.And for those who say B is better than A they either dont know what theyre saying and repeat something they heard or they are plain dumb there is absolutely no difference between an AA cable and a BB cable.,networking,cstclgu,11,t5_2qkaf
4464524,0,t1_cstetxn,Ethernet wiring standards grew out of the modular telephone wiring standards. Telephone had multiple sizes of plug to accommodate different numbers of lines on one cable. The wall jacks would accept any plug with an equal or fewer number of lines. To make this work the first line was in the center and the next line would be the two wires on either side of the first and so on. This is why one of the pairs in an ethernet cable is split across the middle. The outer ones are not split because while this method worked great for phones it caused too much crosstalk inside the connector with the pairs split along parallel paths. The middle two kept their pinout for backwards compatibility with phones. The order of the wires within a pair are not swapped for crosstalk but rather so that the colors will alternate between solid and striped to make it easier to spot an improper order.,networking,cstfj65,12,t5_2qkaf

You can actually permit just the ports used for RPC if you want but MS changes the default ranges with every major windows release.  You will have to look up the range.  Microsoft sucks by the way because they still use this antiquated protocol.EDIT  Also MS left us with this hidden gem.

Let me get down to the root of the issue to explain why I think we need to use VLANs over the WAN We have medical devices with hardcoded IPs on the ..x.x subnet however if they see any traffic which is not meant for them they wont just discard it they reboot by design meaning that we cant have any other equipment aside from the appliance sharing their LAN. These medical devices usually send their nonmedical device logs to a prebuilt appliance computer on the same subnet which sends the logs on to our servers over the internet. The customer doesnt want to have one of these appliances at each location they have the medical devices at they only want to have one appliance that receives all of the logs and then sends them to our server.This means that because the devices are finicky about the traffic they receive they must be isolated but that isolation needs to stretch to all of their locations.,networking,cu8ofle,1,t5_2qkaf

4901320,0,t3_3hz70w,Edit TLDR Break a switch in half and you have  VLANs.Edit  Obligatory holy shit gold!!Edit  Ok I get it.  Thanks guys.  Somebody tell me how to put these in the FAQ and Ill do it.So you know how you can plug two switches into each other and make essentially one larger switch?Now take it in the opposite direction break a port switch in half and make two different port switches.  Those are in this analogy different LANs.When you do this virtually eg in configuration you make VLANs.  Thats it that all there is to it.  You make a bunch of smaller switches out of one larger switch.So when you make these smaller switches you have to number them.  Those numbers are from  to .   and  are reserved and in many cases so are  so  and  are available for your miniLANs.From there you get to realize that you dont exactly have to break it in half you can break it into as many LANs as the device supports maximum number of VLANs and the ports dont have to be contiguouseg you dont have to put port  in one LAN you can put ports    and  in a LAN.  Thats it.Ok so say you have two floors each floor having half of its offices in different departmentssales and accounting.  Each half of each floor has its own switch and you have a connection from the sales switch on floor  to the sales switch on floor  and the same for the accounting switches.  When somebody moves offices you have to go physically move an ethernet cable from the sales switch to the accounting switch or vice versa.VLANs allow you to solve this problem.  You simply put one switch on each floor configure your sales and accounting VLANs.  When somebody moves you simply change which VLAN their port belongs to.Now you want to connect those two switches together.  You could run a connection from the sales side of switch A to the sales side of switch B and a second connection from the accounting side of switch A to the accounting side of switch B you can actually do this but what if there were a way to simply mark traffic traveling between the two big switches with which vlan they belong to?Enter VLAN tagging.  Exactly what happens is you just tell both switches that the port connecting them contains multiple VLANS what those VLANs numbers are and youre done.  This is called a trunk port in Cisco parlance.So in the past if you wanted to keep accounting and sales separate youd need two switches per floor and a link between each departments respective switches.  Now you can do it with one piece of equipment per floor and a single link between them.  This becomes important when you have dozens of switches and dozens of VLANs.Now why would you want to do this?  Mostly policy and to reduce broadcast chatter in huge networks.  There are a bunch of other reasons but its not worth getting into right now.Now you need to put a router on each LAN and provide internet.  You could buy two routers and two internet connections plug one each into each of your LANs and be done.  Or you could buy a router with  ports one for each LAN plus an internet connection connect it to both LANs and the internet configure it up and your golden.  But why couldnt you send the same marking that youre using between your switches to your router and conserve a port?  You can.  Routers support tagged traffic.  Only thing you have to worry about at this point is that each of your VLANs has separate IP address space so that the router can differentiate between the two.  So you configure virtual inverfaces on your router for each lan tell whichever switch you connect your router to that its going to get multiple LANs on that connection and tell the switch to send them and youre golden.So now you have your switches router etc.  Interesting part here is that you can filter traffic between each LAN.  Say you dont want accounting to connect to sales printers.  No problem filter it.Say youve got a dozen switches in a large enterprise or campus environment and someone  blocks away gets moved from accounting to sales?  No problem.  If youre switches and trunk ports are properly configured you simply change Suzies port from one vlan to the other and shes now on that LAN.In good switches every frame has a vlan tag whether you tell it to or not.  By default out of the box every port is on VLAN .  If you make VLAN  and assign ports to it youve got another separate LAN.  Everything moving through the switch internally has a VLAN tag on it it just knows to add them coming in and strip them going out.Now speaking of trunk ports heres another useful scenario.  Say you have a server that needs to provide services to more than one LAN.  You can configure virtual interfaces on it and give it IPs in each LAN tell the switch to send the relevant LANs to it and youve got it.  This is close to one of the best arguments you can make for VLANs Often services Windows networking comes to mind find resources via broadcast frames.  This allows you to segregate your network so that those broadcast frames dont go everywhere with the option of allowing multiple vlans to a device if it or you needs them.Access points are another good place for them.  Say there are different policies for each department and they all want wireless.  You configure multiple SSIDs on your AP and trunk it to your switches and you solve the wifi problem with a single access point.Want a way to automatically tell all you switches about a new VLAN?  Thats called VTP in Cisco.  You configure the vlan on the master switch every other switch learns about it.So now youve got all this traffic between your VLANs going to a routerand in some cases its just a router with a single connection to the switch called a routeronastick.  But what if you could move that forwarding down to the switch?Thats called layer switching and enter SVIs.  For each vlan you configure an IP on a Switch Virtual Interface and then the switch can control the routing between the two LANsand hardware supporting you can do your filtering there too.So a port on a single vlan is called an access port.  The switch knows to strip the vlan tag going out and add a vlan tag going it.Also on a trunk port theres a concept of a native VLAN which tells the switch which VLAN any untagged frames should belong to and to strip the tag off of frames that belong to the native VLAN.  You dont actually have to strip the tags from any VLANs but you do have to tell the switch what to do with an untagged frame it receives.Try this one Say you want to treat your VoIP traffic differently than your bulk data traffic.  So you put your VoIP devices on vlan  and make all your ports trunk ports with VLAN  tagged an  the native stripped VLAN.  Someone can come plug in a laptop and theyll end up on VLAN  because the laptop doesnt understand the VLAN tags but if you plug a properly configured phone i.e. to tag for VLAN  into that port its on the right VLAN.  Security issues of this aside.Lastly the vlan tag called an .Q or just a dotQ tag comes after the MAC addresses.  This was done for a reason So that dumber switches which forward a frame after the destination MAC address is received will continue to functionthey just become multipliers of your trunk port.,networking,cucclml,137,t5_2qkaf

5313911,0,t1_cvqul4g,The timeinqueue metric appears to be a simple and clean solution to the buffer tuning problem with traditional fair queuing is set correctly. Short buffers offer poor TCP throughput and long ones cause excessive queuing delay. If you assume perfectly fair queuing this at least requires someone to tune the buffer for the expected BDP of the link which may be variable.Real fair queuing isnt really feasible anyway as there is limited queue state available in the network it may be feasible on an end station but network gear gives on the order of  queues certainly not n. Eliminating the need to use this hardware for fair queuing even if it were feasible is still a win.I believe this queue delay approach is novel to CoDel and particularly for variable and oftencongested end user links offers an elegant solution that requires no tuning and leverages a single queue. As far as I can tell the approach CoDel takes is novel despite plenty of research into queuing disciplines and a few other approaches gaining enough traction to make it into hardware RED WFQ.gt Your lawn aint nothin special.

Single mode is typically yellow multimode is typically light blue or orange.gt Multimode fiber transmits at  and  Nanometers More usually nm or nm.gt Multimode fiber has a larger core ..micron is pretty much obsolete. Most multimode being installed today is micron.  gt Multimode wavelengths zigzag down the core whereas singlemode wavelengths are longer and therefor much faster. Er no. Multimode fibre being wider allows multiple modes of internal reflection in the fibre hence the zigzagging. Single mode is narrow enough to only really allow light to go straight down the middle. That doesnt materially affect overall speed of propagation. What it means is that on multimode each pulse of light going in comes out smeared at the other end as some photons are following a slightly longer path. The longer the fibre the more pronounced this effect is. This is why multimode fibre connections typically have a much shorter range than single mode equivalents.,networking,cxnyfac,3,t5_2qkaf

5943637,0,t3_3wq9p5,If you really think about it a LAN is a broadcast domain. VLANs segment a broadcast domain within a single device thus creating multiple virtual LANs. By that same logic a WAN is a private network that spans multiple geographic areas. The closest you are going to find to a VWAN is going to be DMVPN. This allows you to create a psudowan like environment across the internet where all spokes are able to dynamically communicate among themselves if using phase  across the Virtual Tunnel Interfaces. To best explain based on what I have seen for my research on VWAN done in the last  minutes with google is either VWAN Bonding  where you  bond multiple WAN connections together to appear as a single WAN connection or VWAN Roaming  to have redundancy between multiple WAN connections with maintained data sessions spanning all WAN connections to prevent loss.Im not sure if any IEEE standards exist for VWAN technologies and Im also not sure as to why you are wanting this added to your resume if you dont know what they are or how they work.,networking,cxyqod8,1,t5_2qkaf

Basically because it then no longer requires any level of knowledge one AS to the other. If you are using a loopback you will need to run an IGP to staticly route to teach it. The idea of eBGP is complete autonomy. Having to install configuration into the remote system breaks this value. Your proper options are.  setup the link as a LAG and peer ip to ip as you will only have one on each side.  setup a peer for each link and download tables. Let ECMP Handel it. setup a peer with table downloads on one and a peer with just a default downloading on the other. Modify the local pref on the default to be less preferred. This will give you a shadow link and be for redundancy the first  options are for load balance.

It works very well. The design was pretty simple. Mount a Ruckus AP we usually used Ns then run ethernet down to the PoE injector.. Run a cable from the data side of the Ruckus PoE injector to the data side of the Ubiquiti PoE injector.. Run another cable from the PoE injector up to a Ubiquiti PTMP radio we usually used Rocket Ms with some kind of dish.. Point them to a single Rocket M sector antenna then bring that down to a PoE injector.. Connect that PoE injector to a switch.. Attach the Zoneflex controller to that switch.. Attach the switch to the router..

The MRC is the obvious monthly cost of bandwidth.  The NRC is the onetime installation cost to deliver the circuit to you.  It is in your best interest to get the carrier to extend the DEMARC all the way to within patchcord distance of your equipment.  Many carriers either will refuse to extend the DEMARC or will charge you several times the realistic cost of this work.  So what will often happen is this   Carrier trenches or bores a hole across your property to enter your building.  Be sure and engaged building facilities management.   Carrier engages contractors to deploy conduit to the designated DEMARC equipment room where their equipment will live.

Im  weeks into consideration and comparison of options to go different directions.I will be direct burying using a blown fiber system probably the one by ericson which means I can actually very very easily add later. Im not planning on implementing even  of what Im proposing in reference to your building out  to be lit from day  comment I just want to have a plan for nondisruptive expansion from  lit strand to  lit strands per pole even if I never actually have fiber blown into that location in the first place.Im going to be trenching the whole way and dropping  microtubes per pole and then putting plastic caps on the tubes.When the first order comes in we blow in  strands of fiber and light  strand with BiDi optics.When the nd through th order comes in we just plug in more BiDi optics. The other  strands are for other carriers to use and I dont care if they use BiDi or CWDM or whatever.If I need to go past  lit strands per pole we blow another set of strands into the nd tube.If  years from now singlemode fiber is obsolete we blow whatever else is required into the nd tube. Im not  about to go out and order  optics modules and  switches and  feet of microducting and  miles of strand fiber but I AM definitely going to plan out how the the cabling plant will grow and evolve for different potential scenarios. As for your mux at the head end comment... you need to muxdemux at  locations... Im simply trying to use  worth of equipment x  muxdemux units to carry  channels over  strands instead of  channels over  strands. A single  microduct pull of tubing can carry x tubes with  strands per tube   strands. It is physically  inches in diameter. One branch of the fiber plant goes north and will service  circuits  channels.  strands of fiber without muxing would require x nanoduct tubes about  feet long before they get to the zone distribution area.  channels on  channel MUXing would require  strands which can be accommodated by x  nanoduct pull and only  blown strand runs of SMF with tubes available for futre blowing. At a distance of  feet the price of  additional nanoduct tubes of  feet and the additional x strand blows FAR surpasses the cost of a giant array of MUX units. Not to mention  strands in a zone distribution box can fit in  rack.  strands is  racks. Its even still  racks if you are using MPO terminations and still  racks if you are filling fusion splicing trays. ,networking,czraarb,1,t5_2qkaf

If PacketShaper can do this then I suppose thats the right tool for the job.  My only quandary would be why this is so important.  You have a WAN circuit with a maximum theoretical capacity of Mbit.  Your egress interface should already be shaping traffic down to a shapeaverage of  of Mbps to allow for bursts that will now peak at roughly Mbps. This way you control the droprate not the carrier.  So at that point if you even leverage simple fairqueueing you should be able to maintain a reasonable distribution of packet flow upstream.

7304423,0,t3_4fb8zc,Im a senior network engineer for an enterprise ISP. My job duties have moved heavily towards building automation tools and systems. Database generators network auditing systems router configuration tools etc.I started out resurrecting a broken network database tool written in bash several years ago. At the time I knew practically zero Linux command line. But I Googled my way into an understanding of why it wasnt working fixed it and slowly began adding features. Then I got my hands on a very rough configuration change deployment tool written in TCL Expect. That was fairly simple to learn and in not terribly long Id vastly improved it it has been used on some  devices to date and forked it into several other tools. Then working with friend of mine who transitioned into a software engineering role we rewrote the database system in AWK and are rewriting the Expect to be heavily modular and flexible.Ive written a number of utilities at this point and have reached a wellpaying position because Im known for using my tools and automation to complete work that would typically take many times longer using manual methods.This week Im handling standardization of the configuration of around  enterprise routers. Ive automated firmware updates and health checks on all of them as well as written an AWK tool that works in concert with my Expect scripts to pull down all of the running configurations extract key details apply them to a standard template push the files to a TFTP server then download the files to the routers set them to reboot using that configuration reload them onto the new firmware and config then run verification that everything completed without issue.Thus far its been very successful and the project manager used to seeing this all done in a much more manual fashion is awestruck. I may ultimately take this code and develop it further into a system for basic translation of router configuration from one make to another.Were also using one of my scripts to move some  routers with another k or so next quarter into a new management system that will likely make many of my tools obsolete. Because of this Im currently working on learning PHP and Python to start making tools that are easier for nontechnical employees to use to find and audit network data. At this point the skills Ive learned thus far have proven far too valuable for me to give up now...!,networking,d28gpfw,1,t5_2qkaf

The location of the SVI will depend on your network. In ours we have a layer  switch at the core. All of our internal networks have their SVI there. For DMZ networks we create the SVI on the firewall. My guess in your network would be that the Fortigate is where you are doing the routing between your existing VLANs what you referred to as interfaces in op so you will need to create the VLAN there with an SVI and also create the VLAN on the switch Wo an SVI just so the switch can carry the VLAN.

LiveAction is a strong Netflow reporting tool with the visualization tools to show you how a specific flow moved through the network.  But then it can go a step further and analyze how that flow was treated by the QoS policies in each network device along the way.  If packets are being dropped by an interface LiveAction can tell you how you could tweak QoS to better address the situation.  LiveAction will deploy the changes necessary if you want.

8691966,0,t3_4z0uw0,Yup you sure can.Ill offer an alternative solution that may fit better for your organization you could have the branch office configured to use a proxy at the HQ.  Check your webfilter  most of them have a proxy function Websense does for sure.So youd use Group Policy to push out the proxy settings to the branch office and configure it so that they cant change their IE settings.Just be aware that Group Policy works best with IE and Chrome.  Even on IE its kind of a hassle though I dont suggest you use the built in Group Policy settings for Internet Settings.  They are buggy and often dont work.  Instead use Group Policy Preferences and Registry settings.  Youll need a bunch of stuff from HKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsThis will update the Proxy Settings for both Chrome and IE.  It wont work for Firefox Firefox ignores Internet Settings from the SystemControl Panel.Just be aware this doesnt play nicely with a lot of non web traffic andor BYOD.  It works best with PCs you have full control over group policy and the users dont have local admin rights.One other method too that doesnt require configuring the proxy settings You can setup Policy Based Routing and only route port  traffic back to your HQ Webfilter.  This is a bit more complex and Im not an expert on it we had a consultant do it in our org.  Essentially this would be policies on your routers inbetween the branch and the HQ that look for port  traffic and if it recieves that type of traffic it will route the traffic to a router closer to the Webfilter.  Keep doing that on all routers inbetween.You will need to make sure your webfilter is properly setup to handleroute IntranetInternal sites as well.,networking,d6s4hvl,2,t5_2qkaf

The closest I ever came to a solution for this problem was to simply double their bandwidth temporarily so they could witness firsthand that their usage patterns were too heavy for their current CIR. The really fun calls were when I would double or triple their bandwidth and then sit back and watch as they managed to consume all of the additional capacity right away.

At the basic layer  level a switch will treat multicast as broadcast i.e. it will forward the frame out all ports in the broadcast domain. The difference comes at the host  a host will process all broadcasts but it will only process a multicast if it is listening for that multicast address discarding any multicast that it is not listening for.IGMP snooping for IPv or MLD snooping for IPv on the switch is what would allow the switch to selectively forward multicast only to the interested listeners allowing the switch to act as youve described. But this is not necessarily something that all switches can do and it is something that could be enableddisabled depending on the environment.gt TLDR IPv multicast ! IPv broadcast and therefore doesnt have the same limitations.Indeed the two are different but if IPv MLD snooping is disabled or not supported then the switch will still treat IPv multicast the same as it would a broadcast.,networking,d977kx3,6,t5_2qkaf

I have never seen a KVMoverIP solution that didnt have multiple quirks.  Remember the devices are trying to parse a not very stable analog signal track its state and resolution changes and convert it to digital.  Analog circuits degrade and vary a lot from device to device. It just never works well. The last place I was at we decided to stop trying new KVMoverIP devices they didnt get any better and work on getting rid of servers that didnt have builtin capabilities.  When we needed additional capacity or when something broke we just continued with used Avocent DSR stuff from eBay. It meant fighting Java versions because the stuff was no longer being updated by Avocent but the new stuff also had Java problems.  There is still a bunch of it out there. And dont forget to buy one dongle for every machine you want to control. As far as I know Dell KVMoverIP stuff has always been made by someone else and rebranded usually from Avocent. Or whoever Avocent is these days.  Also if you look at the builtin cards like DRAC they usually have a chip from Avocent or Raritan on them. ,networking,dco5d8u,3,t5_2qkaf

A great example is the modern hypervisor.  VMware ESXi HyperV KVM or Xen do not add value on their own.  They only become valuable when you add another layer on top of them that allows their value to become apparent.  A commodity switch will provide the basic functionality that you would expect from a switch but will require additional functionality from another level to really shine.  In this instance a dumb layer  Gbe switch that does not support VLANs would be commodity but then a software switch on the hypervisor could provide vxlan services that allows the commodity switch to be used in a modern datacenter.,networking,dcs8s6e,1,t5_2qkaf

10511132,0,t3_5qibw1,gt Is this type of thing common?It really depends on how diligent they are in updating their PTR records and how much they care about it. All of the IP addresses under the control of the ISP I work for have a valid PTR record. All new Netblocks are given a default PTR by a script when the netblock is loaded different default PTRs for home and commercial customers and another default by internal IPs used by us. Any individual changes made to an IP is done manually in a webbased GUI by our call center and provisioning people for example if a customer runs their own mail server we need to change the ptr to be server.whatever.tld. When that customer disconnects or changes their service or we purpose the IP for something else provisioning may not be as diligent as they need to and update the PTR or change it back to default  Back when I used to work in the call center getting calls from customers who got a new IP block or never noticed that they had one with a nondefault PTR were not uncommon.,networking,dczjr7m,3,t5_2qkaf
10527613,0,t1_dcwwz49,Going to start out saying I work at a partner. These are my  cents  The endpoint license is pretty damn cheap compared to regular AV or even Cylance or Traps and it does have an AV checkbox if you want to enable it.  Its pretty cool and offers antimalware with visibility to the endpoints. Now you can buy that separately from the Firepower solution but I think its cool you can combine the two and see some extra intelligence in the dashboard.  Quarantining endpoints is great too but you need to have a supported NAC ISE to make that happen on the port level or you can do stuff like firewallroute shun without anything else etra.  RA VPN  Im part of the partner betas for that. Its coming probably in the next couple months when the beta is over. Someone asked what FP vs ASA with Firepower is. Firepower Threat Defense FTD is the unified code which has a lot of great features on it but there are obviously features missing from ASA as theyre porting stuff over.

I loved it because I was able to branch out and learn.I worked at that company for  years and network engineer was my second career first was in health industry. My company sold out to another company that comes in and basically runs things into the ground this was also a sudden announcement. I decided not to stick around.I received quite a few calls from carriers to come work for them but after talking with them I felt I would be pigeonholed into doing the same thing everyday. While working for my company all of those years I had done design and implementation for some smaller companies that I also monitored and maintained. With the closing they would be losing all network support so I called them up.

10792153,0,t3_5ubwtb,One of the things that gets missed about ACI deployment is that its possible to run it in a networkcentric mode.  This isnt nearly as sexy as the full granular appbyapp microsegmented wave of the future but is actually a big win.In essence its basically just approaching ACI as a centrally managed fabric providing basic L and L functionality.  Each BD has a single EPG and the two BD  EPG more or less correspond to a VLAN.  You bring hosts up  virtual or physical  and get them assigned to the right EPG and it just works.  The netcentric approach is  by itself  a big win versus traditional setups in that all of the troubleshooting configuration and operation happens from a single point.  The usual issues around plumbing VLANs all over the place managing STP ..or VPC EVPN etc disappear.  Software maintenance becomes a setandforget task and a great many daytoday tasks can generally be either eliminated or fully automated.  Again  this is just asking ACI to just do simple LL not completely overhauling how applications are provisioned and so forth.  Its how most of the really successful production ACI has actually been implemented and can absolutely act as a foundation for doing the really cool SDNish stuff but even if its just only used as a clean automateable central fabric its still a net win.,networking,ddt4ulk,2,t5_2qkaf

They promised replacements months ago but keep dragging it out due to Chinese new year needing to manufacture new ones getting internal RMA procedures working etc. On the plus side they are now at least testing them andFrom another vendor Ive learned that the ProCurve SFPs e.g. JA deviate from the MSA design in some ways so it is not a matter of simply flashing a generic SFP with the right bits in the EEPROM.Ive done an EEPROM dump of the Fiberstore ones myself and they say Fiberstore in the vendor field even quite different from what a genuine part would say.,networking,de3rh1g,3,t5_2qkaf

11126540,0,t1_det522c,I guess I just assumed that your ultimate goal was to get tftp working.  The problem with what youre trying to do with iptables is that you dont know what source port the tftp server is going to pick and nothing I know of will do that kind of dynamictostatic port translation.  You can statically map one port to another but mapping a range of ports to a single outgoing port isnt possible in any NAT device Im aware of since it could break a lot of things and has pretty limited value.So you could either persist in trying find a tftp server that will use a fixed port or just use the feature of iptables thats intended to solve the problem you have which I still believe is the cleaner fix.  TFTP is an old protocol and the dynamic port selection by the server is the standard behavior.  Also many firewalls do support it as it appears iptables does as does pfSense and most of the commercialgrade firewalls on the market.  Do most home firewalls support it?  Perhaps not but home users running tftp servers is likely an extremely rare thing and it wouldnt surprise me if many ISP block tftp traffic anyway.,networking,det6mo6,1,t5_2qkaf

If you set maxKeepAliveRequests to  on the connector in your server.xml file that should make it drop the connection immediately after each request.PDF generator libraries dont generally know the length of a file before they output it so your choices are to stream it through without a ContentLength header or spool it to a temp file first so you can get the length.

11219940,0,t1_df3mftc,Agreed. Thats why I was careful to say can rather than does as there are a lot of badincomplete implementations out there and certainly DPI devices running older code are more likely to suffer from these issues as its mainly been changes to web browsers in deprecating insecure ciphers SHA signatures etc. that has driven vendors to do things properly.I mentioned the problems with cipher suites and TLS versions also applies to using SHA to sign the dynamicallycreated certificates as you say.The other thing to bear in mind is that a lot of vendors will historically have limited support to lowergrade cipher suites for performance reasons. I have seen situations where enabling support for stronger ciphers has effectively killed the DPI box given the traffic it was having to process requiring an expensive hardware replacement.Another complexity is supporting ephemeral keys perfect forward secrecy as this places yet more requirements on the DPI device many DPI devices dont support PFS cipher suites. Also the passive method for serverside DPI cant work with PFS cipher suites  the proxying mechanism has to be used.For example Palo Alto  who do generally have a good implementation  only started supporting PFS for clientside DPI what they call forward proxy inspection in sw version . and for serverside DPI inbound inspection in sw version . Palo Alto always used the passive method for inbound inspection but have had to implement the proxy method for PFS to work. ,networking,df3rle6,3,t5_2qkaf

One of the things youre going to run into even if you can get the costs correct is that the BGP redistributed route will be an external LSA while the direct OSPF one will most likely be internal possibly even interarea. IIRC regardless of cost internal routes are preferred to external. Since OSPF is a linkstate protocol the database is supposed to be consistent across all devices so mangling it on this one router to achieve what you want isnt really allowed. Youd probably have to do something like have a VRF just to receive the routes over the DMVPN and then leak them back into your normal VRF with some policy to adjust their cost along the way then redistribute these into your local OSPF.,networking,dfczyyr,2,t5_2qkaf

In the TLS client hello the validator uses the Server Name Indicator to say hello server I think your name is ltlongrandomstring.invalidgt Domcain validation succeeds if the server responds with a selfsigned cert with the matching subject name.My plugin causes the ASA to pass this test by installing a temporary matching cert for that domain name. The ASA syntax for this is    ssl trustpoint lttrustpointgt domain ltlongrandomstring.invalidgtTLSSNI is probably going to be deprecated for one in which the challenge string the certs subject name isnt communicated directly by the SNI header. Rather the SNI sent by LEs validator will be a token that refers to a previously negotiated challenge string which must appear in the certificate.This change mitigates a risk that some innocent victim might be operating a server which generates certs on the fly in response to incoming SNI headers.

11439800,0,t3_63abdl,Required ReadingOn a Nexus K there are two types of consistency checks Type  and Type .  The allowed VLAN list is a Type  check so it will simply suspend the mismatched VLAN until consistency is restored as opposed to Type  which would disable the entire port.  Depending on the version of NXOS youre running and whether or not graceful consistencycheck is configured a Type  mismatch can bring down all members of a vPC if any fail a Type  consistency check.There is no automatic copy of the configuration from one NK to the other in the sense that a change wont trigger a consistency check and potentially be service disrupting.  There is configsync which allows you to have the NK replicate configuration changes or you can manually configure each NK and the VLAN will come up once the configuration is matched.It may have improved in more recent versions but in my experience configurationsync should generally be avoided.  The use of config sync has a lot of caveats to remember and almost always ends up in a weird state depending on what you configure using config sync vs. config term.  There are also bugs in removing configuration not applying correctly and then throwing the config sync system into an indeterministic state where the sync config doesnt match the running config and you cant make further changes as a result.  TLDR I would avoid config sync if possible.,networking,dfsovjl,2,t5_2qkaf

But keep in mind this is only for an optimum client close by.  Keep in mind if clients roam improperly to a far away AP it could look much worse!gt Ive done multiple site surveys  lucky for us were in our own nonshared suite with no one around us.Site survey with what?  Just a regular laptop looking for other SSIDs?  That only picks up other . devices.  Most sources of bad interference that cause issues with WLANs is NONwifi devices that wont show up on a wifi scan.  Old .Ghz analog cordless phones analog wireless TV transmitters etc.  You may have a hidden source of interference crapping all over you that you dont even realize.Youll need a spectrum analyzer to really see what is going on in the band.  But a  Nanostation Loco is one way to get that ability on the cheap though it does use Java which can be yuck.  Still gets the job done! gt In Ghz I have all the channels set manually  Hz. I only have  APs so Im able to set each channel and turn the power all the way up.Eh mkay this is where I think you might have made the wrong move.  Personally Id just use auto power reduction and let clients get mhz channels if they want for those high speed demands.When you have mhz wide channel only ALL clients have to share that mhz!  As datarates go up with higher mhz widths clients need to spend less airtime moving their data so you actually are hurting yourself here a bit! Also remember wireless is a way communication.  Your AP might have high power but the clients are all weak.  So you might have some clients where the AP is having hard time hearing them because they erroneously stayed connected to an AP that was too far away due to the extra power you are spewing out.  Wireless is RTSCTS and by keeping high power you have probably introduced the hidden node problem.  Some client out there with a mbps upload data rate keeps trying to upload but gets collisions due to that thus causing a retransmit storm.  With RF airtime is the most precious commodity! gt but  I did come across a handful of clients that have greater than  Retransmissions.Find what is common about those clients.  Were they .?  ?  All off the same AP in the same band?  gt the application is about  slower on the WLAN than on the LAN. Where it would take  seconds to load a chart on a desktop were seeing  seconds to load on a wireless clientThat doesnt make a lot of sense.  Properly tuned wifi should be basically like mbit ethernet or even faster with just a bit more latency perhaps.   Start some continuous pings running canary in the coal mine and run some repeatable benchmark tests.    Start tweaking AP settings with a lone client connected to the test AP and see if you have found some kind of bugged setting youve got on Meraki that is causing this.  The idea is to get wired like performance over wifi in a lab setting then scale it up.  As you put it  second delay to  second delay seems pretty extreme!
