6122711,0,t1_cyl7gqe,Coletta smiled slowly at Richelieu as her eyes finally closed and she drifted off to sleep. It had been one of the few nights she actually slept properly and all the night through. When she woke up in the morning in an unfamiliar space and started to panic. It was a loud purring that came from next to her that reminded her where she was. Reenchanted by the cat she began to scratch his chin as she wondered what she should do. She really wanted to change her clothes.Professor Lawson? Coletta called out timidly. ,MischiefManagedRP,cyll74n,1,t5_3bfhq
6149611,0,t1_cyoms6z,Wei frowned slowly nodding her head. Do yoNo Cillian! She jumped out of her seat moving over to him as he was about to add the fang to the cauldron. No crush it again counterclockwise youll get better results! She guided his hand and the mortar he held back to the table. Then add it otherwise it comes out all wonky! She turned around giggling as she looked to Coletta before returning to her seat. Book club? I guess we could join book club...Well I mean...If you wanted to I didnt...I dont... Weis cheeks began to burn as her head slumped slightly between her shoulders which also fell a bit. I dont want to be a bother sorry. I shouldnt invite myself to do so many things with you.,MischiefManagedRP,cyona5q,2,t5_3bfhq
6158514,0,t3_3zwhfu,Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus the school motto. Phineas Nigellus Black was mindful of those words when he came out of his office to meet the Minister for Magic at the appointed hour to lead the visitor inside. While there were many people and things in the world that the Headmaster had no earthly patience for he wasnt about to needlessly insult or antagonize the Minister. The Ministry could make his life more difficult in a myriad of ways and that was precisely the opposite of what he wanted out of life. Archibald had worn Beauxbatons colors todaypredictably enoughhe noted to himself as he approached the Minister. Minister it is indeed a pleasure he greeted the French transplant with a gracious bow of his head. There were those who argued that Phineas had no business using that word as he hadnt the slightest acquaintance with pleasure to know what the word actually meant. Having anticipated that the Minister would stay true to sartorial form for this particular visit the Headmaster had chosen to wear a robe that appeared black on first blush but with movement and changes in lighting a multitude of iridescent green shades were revealed. The robe was trimmed in silver brocade depicting elaborately looped and intertwined serpents and three silver chains stretched across his chest holding it in place over his inner robe. The robe underneath was a rich emerald green buttoned from hem to throat with gleaming silver buttons embossed with the Hogwarts Crest. Do come in and make yourself comfortable. Would you care for any refreshments? He asked as he led the Minister inside where a pair of highbacked armchairs with a small tea table between them had been set up in front of his desk where ordinarily there would have been only a pair of uncomfortable wooden chairs for students to sit in. It was a rare gesture that hed arranged a place where they could sit face to face to speak rather than holding the conversation from behind his desk as he would with almost any other guest. He waited for the Minister to sit before he settled into the other armchair and laid his forearms atop the armrests. I know you too well to think that you came all this way just to wish me a happy New Year. How can I be of service to you today Minister? ,MischiefManagedRP,cypnqvn,2,t5_3bfhq
6159599,0,t1_cypr6nb,Alright Saturday sounds good. Alexander said cheerfully surprised to find that he was actually looking forward to it. This sweet happy girl was making his evening a lot more interesting than he had expected. But he seemed to tense at the mention of her mother being proud of her. It was impossible not to think of his own mother who never had much interest in whatever he was doing. Thinking about it he couldnt remember the last time he had a meaningful conversation with her. Despite this unpleasant thought he tried to smile convincingly. Im sure she will.,MischiefManagedRP,cyps70s,2,t5_3bfhq
6302087,0,t1_cyzdh3p,Ezra felt a momentary sense of relief at Persephones reply that she wasnt about to leave him to face whatever it was alone. Certainly hed suggested the idea and yes hed meant his suggestion but that wasnt to imply that it was the solution he actually desired. It was just what was right  a formality that should she have chosen to embrace he could hardly have faulted or blamed her for. Indeed he murmured eyes fixed unwaveringly now on the rattling cupboard.He had very little intention of finding out what was inside forcing open the door seemed a fools or Gryffindors choice  neither of which Ezra counted himself as. He considered her suggestion that they leave together with a slightly knitted brow. True the consequences of being caught unchaperoned were rather unpleasant but given that the cupboard presented an unknown it would truly be illogical to take it over school discipline. And they could perhaps talk their way out of the situation if the cupboard continued its rattling it could be provided as proof.Nodding slowly he took one careful quiet step backwards inching back towards his abandoned bag. His plan was to remain forward facing lest the cupboard spring open collect his bag then carry on with Persephone towards the classroom door  eyes always trained on the disturbance. I think Im inclined to agree with you... we ought to make haste as quietly as possible he said voice steady in a low tone.A few steps backwards and right arm outstretched behind him eventually connected with the handle of his bag. He had only just begun to breathe a small sigh of relief when there was an almighty screeching noise and a crash.,MischiefManagedRP,cz5z5cv,1,t5_3bfhq
