8200984,0,t1_d52jv4l,The last  true pnr players Lin has played with were Ed Davis and Tyson Chandler.  There really hasnt been much sample size for Lin the pnr guard.  I understand your view of Lin as a slasher since thats what hes been asked largely to do.  But Lin got Davis paid and revived Chandlers offensive game which had been completely stagnant for the Knicks up to that point.  When he was on the floor with Asik in Houston they also played a lot of pnr but Asik developed clubs for hands when Howard joined the team the second year.  Lets just wait and see if they get the chemistry going in preseason.  If they do pnr defense will be a very high priority in game planning against the Nets.,GoNets,d52ode7,3,t5_2sro2

8570405,0,t1_d6cvd84,VC in his best year with us averaged ppg and about  rbs and asts on like  shooting. He also played for  years on the Nets. Vince also started to decline after that first year but he had more NBA mileage on him.Drazen played  years for us the first of which he only played  games. In his best and sadly final year playing for us he was getting ppg on an incredible  shooting and high  FT shooting. He also had about  rbs and  assists per game.Vince had a better best year with us his first for the Nets. I do think Drazen had he lived longer wouldve cemented himself as the best Net shooting guard all time. How long they played for us plays a pretty important part in this. Regardless any Nets fan who knows our history they all should unless brand new should mention Drazen as a Nets Legend in my mind. He was something special. Also watch Once Brothers from ESPNs  for .

And that is better than the league average for shooting long twos and about the same percentage as Carmelo Anthony one of the best at the long two shoots his long twos. So while it is a bad shot it actually isnt a percentage that killing us.But really I think he and the coaching staff think he is going to bring that percentage up. If they thought he was going to top out at  then yeah they would end this crap just like they dont take many long twos. But hopefully he gets better. Like you say by picking his spots better.

11172691,0,t3_5zik2d,George Hill is good but I dont know about a max deal for a guy on the wrong side of . That doesnt seem like good basketball sense to me. Similarly does he leave a team on the rise in Utah to go rebuild? Lastly that would be quite an experiment to have two starting PGs on the roster. Im calling BS on that one. ,GoNets,deyeumy,6,t5_2sro2

11188165,0,t1_dezbhp8,Ive liked him since his NY days Im a fan and keep tabs on him every now and then. But Im not delusional enough to believe hes THE most clutch player in the league with that said yes he tends to be more often than not a clutch player. Also lol at once in a decade kind of player.,GoNets,df05yov,1,t5_2sro2
11197999,0,t3_5zuyi0,The game was fun to watch. I am very pleased our players are buying into the system and playing hard. They are playing hungry and playing to win. Its surprising to see such level of energy at this late stage of the season considering our record. ,GoNets,df1a2v4,6,t5_2sro2
11217595,0,t1_df33rsf,KA is an excellent coach.  We have a bunch of D league players improving into NBA rotation players.  Lin looks better than ever and I have no doubt some of that credit belongs to KA.  Lin is on a minutes restriction...youre the same guy who was complaining before about Lin not getting enough minutes coming off his first hamstring injury.  Now hes coming off his second and its like you havent learned your lesson.The medical staff puts in the minutes restriction.  A good coach sticks to it.  He doesnt risk Lins health to win a meaningless game in a lost season. Lin fans have got to CHILL.  And this is coming from a guy with a username GOATLin.,GoNets,df3i1b0,12,t5_2sro2

11328790,0,t1_dffy0l4,Yeah I feel like KJ over Skil for sure and leaning towards Goodwin over him but Im just not sure cause Skil seems harder to replace.

11394428,0,t1_dfmv81e,RHJ needs specifically to work on his off hand this summer. There was a point last night in the th where he got a pass right under the basket right block. He then had to take two steps to get to the other side of the rim because he wasnt confident going up. This gave Drummond time to recover and alter the shot.That needs to be a quick catch and layup if Rondae is going to be playing PF. ,GoNets,dfnjjn9,2,t5_2sro2

11511212,0,t1_dg0rxzq,Dude you are just too ridiculous. You keep talking about how the Nets are such a smart team yet and talking about how all these other teams are so dumb when the Nets are historically one of the worst teams. They are currently awful I mean you can add up their wins from the past two years and the Celtics this year have double digit more wins. Im surprised you havent talked about how Lin is actually better than Thomas. I mean Celtic players need to be plus in all categories in order not to be awful players in your eyes. ,GoNets,dg0sq35,1,t5_2sro2

11764068,0,t1_dgt3uy1,Good points. After having a night to sleep on it Im not sure I would do it anymore. But hes still young enough and not far removed from a couple of decent seasons so Id like to think its still in there but yeah its possible it isnt. He has had multiple shoulder surgeries though. I do like Terrance Ferguson. If hes still there on draft day at no.  maybe Ill do it. Include the  pick for Nicholson and we could talk Portland really shot themselves in the foot with the worlds most expensive bench. ,GoNets,dgthj1f,3,t5_2sro2
