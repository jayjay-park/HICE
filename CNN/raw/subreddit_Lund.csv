648618,0,t3_21kle2,Classes are smaller than in the us generally less than  students. Professors are not treated with the respect they deserve in my opinion it is more of a peer relationship with them. Rent is around kr a month and food can be acquired for kr. Swedes are generally quite shy except when drunk. There are the clubs called nations which are basically fraternities which if you wish to be a part of the student culture here in Lund you must join its really fun and you meet lots of people. Im an international mentor at the university pm me if there is something more you wish to know.,Lund,cgdzxw3,7,t5_2s83s
922821,0,t3_24or4y,gtHow much Swedish language I should know?Assuming your job doesnt require it you dont need to know a word. Almost everyone here are fluent in English more or less so you wont have any problems getting around. Swedish is preferred in social encounters but if you only intend to stay  months there is no points to try and learn it.gtCan I ask strangers for directions? I heard personal space is really importantYou can ask anyone for directions they will be glad to help.gtDo you still queue if you are just going to ask a question to store staff?Usually yes.,Lund,ch96hyf,3,t5_2s83s

2536944,0,t3_2oqq5w,I can speak for Sydsknska since Im soon to be foreman for one of the clubs there. The official slogan for SSK is Where the music matters. We have  different regular clubs Svartklubben Urban Hip Hop RnB Heartland PopIndiepop Electrified Electronic and Foxen Funk. Clubs are generally on Saturdays.  Then there are a ton of other stuff going on all through the week afternoon teasdag pub and kaf matin and a lunch on Fridays.  Im sure the other nations have just as much stuff they do and most of the ones on Tornavgen which are the ones Im most familiar with have regular clubs.My suggestion is to just try to go around and see where you like it.  And you should also give working on a nation a chance the nation will appreciate it and you might like it. And generally if you get involved with a nation youd get more perks and more parties.

2707376,0,t1_cnb8rbn,Your dorm is definitely not too far to walk unless youve got a health issue or something Ive walked from Klostergarden to the centralnorth part of campus many times.  Its a minute walk.  Theres also a bus that picks up at Klostergarden and goes to the train station which is also walking distance from the language building.  Really dont worry.  Im an American and I use my swipe cards EVERYWHERE.  They do work in the Skanetrafiken machines though not every machine sometimes it just randomly doesnt work then I just move to the next one.  Ive never had a problem in shops though.  My advice Dont lose your mind you can applaud I know its genius.  The public transit system is much more efficient here than anything in the US and the Skanetrafiken ticket agents who will set you up with your jojo card are helpful will take the time to make sure you understand everything and will either speak English well enough for you to get all your questions answered or refer you to someone who does.  Just about everyone else speaks English wherever you go and honestly I feel like the standards for customer assistance are high  store clerks take the time to listen and give you thorough answers not just sell you some package discount their manager has told them to push on customers of course there are exceptions.  My experience with skatteverket was good  fast and efficient.    Im on mobile so I cant see all that youve written but I think you get the gist of my message.  Things will be different but theyll most likely be okay OR BETTER Swedes enjoy a pretty high standard of living compared to the US in many ways.  The bureaucracy is a headache but its more efficient than in the US.,Lund,cnbth0o,3,t5_2s83s

4559226,0,t3_3da5ff,Hey mate! Where are you from? I think we are in the same boat when it comes to housing. I feel completely fucked over if only I knew before chosing Lund that finding somewhere to sleep would be as difficult as this. We might bring our tents and sleep under a bridge somewhere cringe,Lund,ct5b3zy,3,t5_2s83s
5258734,0,t1_cvjq1ig,Yes in Delphi I was very pleased. A bedroom and bathroom to myself of maybe m a large shared kitchen and a large shared living area. I think a few of the accommodation buildings have slightly different arrangements e.g. a few shared bathrooms to a corridor rather than one each but the basic bedroom and shared kitchenliving is all you need as a young funloving student.If you want to get Swedes in your corridor tick the correct boxes in the application process or dont tick I would like an international corridor. As someone else said youll just be choosing areas in order of your preference and then hoping that you are given something.,Lund,cvjv69w,3,t5_2s83s
