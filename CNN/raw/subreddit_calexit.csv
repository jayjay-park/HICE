9603550,1,t1_d9wn9iy,Heres a realistic scenario if Calexit actually got far enough to be a serious possibilityThe US Federal government would laugh and say No.  If Calexit persisted the Federal Government would then jokingly respond with a statement roughly saying You and what army?  If Calexit still persisted after that stage the following would unfold. Northern and Southern California would not be interested in going with Calexit.  They would call for assistance against the seditious Calexit government in Central California hereafter referred to as the Central California Republic or CCR.. Guard forces and the Federal Law Enforcement would be sent to subdue the CCR and arrest its leaders.  Seeing as California has successfully and deliberately disarmed its citizens as well as sent the bulk of its military bases to parts of the state that lean conservative successful resistance is very unlikely.. If the CCR managed to resist in spite of this it would be encircled and utilities would be cut.  Seeing as California imports astounding amounts of electricity and water this would cripple the government.. Within a week most of the CCR would capitulate or be unable to put up any further resistance.The likely fallout would be the formation of two new states Jefferson and South California and one new Military District consisting of the former CCR.  Reintegration into the Union and reinstatement of its rights would take up to a decade and during that time almost all of its major industries would flee to States where they could better do business.  The CCR would leave its occupation as a shadow of its former self and would add two conservativeleaning states to the Union to boot.,calexit,d9wu1at,0,t5_3hgj5
9605058,0,t1_d9wtphv,No less populated states count more since its a sum of the Representatives proportional to population and Senators  per state that the state has in Congress plus  votes for DC equal to if it was one of the least populated states. Within a state rural and urban votes count the same but nationally the Electoral College ensures that less populated states like Wyoming and Rhode Island can have their concerns voiced a little bit more.It also decentralizes the election. Purely hypothetically speaking under a popular vote system if a really corrupt politician allowed their countys ballot box rural or otherwise to be stuffed with millions upon millions of votes and count them all as if they were legitimate there wouldnt be a legal infrastructure to declare that result void because bureaucratically speaking that candidate won the national electoral vote. With the electoral college that type of damage would only impacts the outcome of a singular state.If rural votes counted more Illinois and California wouldnt be as safely blue as they are. Just look at the  gubernatorial election results from Illinois for example. Chicago is the only deep blue part of the state yet the state consistently goes blue because rural and urban votes are equal within a state under the Electoral College.,calexit,d9x0qak,1,t5_3hgj5

We can have a referendum on becoming an independent nation and when push comes to shove we are holding a lot of the cards.If congress wont allow it then a vote among the states could. Both are unlikely but with so many red states and conservatives in America it would ensure a GOP majority for some time and they can create the conservative hellhole theyve always dreamed of. So thats a rather big incentive to vote yes on it.If theyre still against it at this point I will be happy for California because this would have been a big fuck you to the backwards red states at which point Id fully support California using their power and influence in other creative and bold ways to get a better deal.
