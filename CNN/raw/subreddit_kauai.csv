3948569,0,t1_cr0ql33,I did that tour with holo holo about a month ago and got so unbelievably sea sick. Swells were huge. The whole thing was nuts. Would never do it again. I was completely and totally unprepared for the incredible rocking of the boat with those  foot swells or whatever they were. Does time of the year make a huge difference?  I know some folks do kayaking of na pali. I assume you need calmer seas for that?,kauai,cr6dd61,1,t5_2rfam

My Jeep wouldve totaled their little VersaI have had another stop because they missed their turn off to that pineapple stand on the highway after the Hanamaulu light. They then reversed. While Im in my  ton van barreling towards them,kauai,crojplt,1,t5_2rfam

5416111,0,t1_cw3324c,Ugh.. yes! I didnt mean to type that. My intention was only to note we were traveling from the mainland or  states. My family in Hawaii would give me a huge eyeroll for that one. Please dont tell. haha,kauai,cw3ytj4,1,t5_2rfam
5991866,0,t3_3xieue,I spent a week in both. The Green Sand Beach is cool but dangerous the lava fields are interesting at night and there is a lot of historical things to see on Big Island. But as far as things to do and sights to see its worth it to go to Kauai again ,kauai,cy52bzd,1,t5_2rfam
6393789,0,t3_437k2t,There are a few ranches on Kauai. Big Island is more known for this though. But on Kauai there is not much at the private household scale. Most people dont have all that much land. ,kauai,czgeoj5,2,t5_2rfam

7212919,0,t1_d1whp7t,gt I think the trick is to stick with communities that are made of a majority of mainlandersIf this is really they way you think then why even live here?  All the scary brown people that live here must really frighten you.gt number of shootingsaltercations shown on the newsOn Kauai?  You should consider presenting some evidence of this.  Yes there are areas on Kauai that tend to be on the lower end of socioeconomic scale of things.  And there are certainly drug issues and sketchy people.  Shootings on the news?  It happens but very infrequently.,kauai,d1y1wtv,3,t5_2rfam

8013235,0,t1_d4gqfm6,safe beach recommendationsnon dangerous fun activity suggestions would be appreciated! I am nervous about hiking because I have been warned of how slippery the trails can be I have hiking poles for stability but I dont have the capacity for huge hikes anymore. As for healthy food its about moderation this is my honeymoon after all there will be some indulging ,kauai,d4grgf5,1,t5_2rfam
8395511,0,t3_4umfeb,Personally I love Hanalei because it has lots of food and shops plus close to lots of great beaches. Princeville is close by as well and has a market and some shops. You really cant miss on the North Shore.,kauai,d5qzhyu,8,t5_2rfam
9325488,0,t1_d8xzj1v,well only you know your dates and the rates youre being quoted so i cant compare. if you go to homeaway.com you can easily put in those dates and it will display all the rentals on a map along with price. you probably wouldnt want to be in a tent surely. a centrally located second floor oceanfront br condo in kapaa was less ltk... so our room cost less than the difference between two of your resorts. it had a big lanai that overlooked wailua bay. imo it was a great location because we could plan a day up north or a day south and do a few things at a time. there was a foodland and safeway nearby for any grocery stuff we needed. if youre only there for  nights she might prefer only a few outings and to spend the rest of the time at the pool. definitionsyour napali hike is on the kalalau trail which starts at kee beach where the road ends on the north side of the island. st regis is somewhat near this.most likely your napali coast boat ride is leaving out of port allen which is on the southwest side. the other two resorts in poipu are nearer to this. your waimea canyon hike is going to be on the west side and thats a drive from the st regis. with  days   nights youre pushing it with a kalalau trail mi hike with probably some snorkeling beforeafter at kee then a full day on the southwest side for the niihaunapali boat tour then another day on the south side to go up and check out all the lookouts waimea and hike something up there then maybe a drive to get to the tubing thing and then your possible deep sea tour.add in breakfastlunchdinner and youre basically  booked... not a lot of time to enjoy any of those resort amenities. ,kauai,d8y2opv,3,t5_2rfam

11219407,0,t1_df3kur3,Oh good. The DoH was trying to implement new rules in . Super cess pools for more than one property are no longer allowed. Glad to hear that the rules have been changed for new properties as well.I was just saying that the septic pollution is not left over from the old days.  Its a big problem in Hawaii since it has the most cess pools in the nation and they were legal to build in this millennium. At least until very recently...,kauai,df3pf45,1,t5_2rfam
