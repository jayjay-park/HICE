425590,0,t3_1yv5xd,I just went down to the local auto store and bought fiberglass resin and the fabric from them. Honestly brand isnt going to matter unless you are really good at it. Just plan on doing multiple layers to make it as strong as you want. The real effort will be in the finish work when you have bondo glaze it so it gets  smooth.As for foam I just went down to a local custom seat guy and asked where he bought his stuff.
