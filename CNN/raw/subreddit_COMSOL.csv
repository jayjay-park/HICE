5232508,0,t1_cvbncon,Hey man Id love to but the link says I need to sign up for some webinar and every time I try it refuses to allow me to do so.Kind regardsEDIT Just emailed the teacher of the webinar apparently the president of sales of the US why the hell not... and asked him for access to either the tutorial or the webinar as any service request through official channels gets denied due to my student licence. If any of you know another way to get access to the video or tutorial please let me know. Cheers!,COMSOL,cvgphym,2,t5_2swm1
