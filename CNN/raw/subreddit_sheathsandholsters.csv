3111226,0,t1_cok99kt,Because its easier for my girlfriend to draw it this way in a hurry but im sort of guessing you missed both comments how its not for me and due to certain clothing related circumstances. Flipper or auto nothing beats an already open blade being drawn already in a proper grip Not sure who in their right mind would stab someone for getting punched... Thats insane lol I know my laws and my self defense. Im not  and a gangmemer or something. Besides my self defense is gr and it comes with  other friends inside my Springfield. So yeah self defense works fine. Assaulting someone with a knife in a fight is far from self defense. Shooting someone on the street is far from self defense. Reppeatedly stabbing a sex offender trying to take you somewhere against your will is a different story. Gunning down a bulgrar on your property threatining you with a gun of his own is a different story. Maybe some day ill live in a place as crime free as Canada lol but until then yeeee hawww I guess PEdited because some mornings I sound like an abrasive ass lol,sheathsandholsters,cokh785,2,t5_33e89

4973713,0,t1_culgf4v,I wouldnt really mind waiting since it would kind of give me time to save the money needed. Im not really picky about what it would be made out of as long as it can be somewhat stealthy while still not being concealed.,sheathsandholsters,culh24c,1,t5_33e89
