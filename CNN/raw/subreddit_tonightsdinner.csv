I think mint I think lamb  the two are practically synonymous. If I have lamb in the fridge Im going to get some mint to go on there. If I have mint lamb is definitely on the grocery list.

389716,0,t3_1yhyd2,Gah no!!!! Dont steam your kale! D IMO steaming is like rd after microwaving and boiling when it comes to terrible veggie prep methods. The BEST way to prepar e kale heat some coconut oil in a wok or large pan. Toss in kale be careful of flying oil. Cook until JUST soft and turns a slightly lighter shade of green. Kale should NEVER be as limp as it is in your photo. Anyway then sautee some garlic or shallots and toss them together with the kale. DELISH! And so frickin easy too.Edit nvm didnt realize you were using baby kale. I still dont think it should be steamed though.,tonightsdinner,cfl5rly,2,t5_2qxea

Here is a picture I happened to take of this step. The only one I took. Sorry.But yeah I covered that in foil put it in the oven at like  until a good amount of the fat had rendered out kind of like  hoursish. I might have dropped the temperature a bit. After that I cooled it off. Cut it into sections scored the fat and seared the shit out of it.Pickled fennelThinly sliced one bulb of fennel on a mandolin c water c rice wine vinegar c apple cider vinegar T sugar T saltCouple cloves of garlicGood amount of chili flake I wanted it to be kind of spicy.Combined everything but the fennel in a sauce pan and brought it to a boil to dissolve salt and sugar.Poured over fennel and let it steep for like ish minutes. Then drained and held onto pickling liquid.Butternut Squash and Plumcot Sweet and Sour SaucePeeled seeded and chopped a butternut squash roasted in  oven with olive oil salt and pepper until fork tender.Pitted and diced  plumcots but that was only because I couldnt find apricots but I am sure any kind of tartish stone fruit would work.Added squash and plumcots some of the braising liquid and some of the pickling liquid. Kept tasting it until it was where I wanted it to taste but it was kind of thick so I added some water and blended that up until it got saucey.Steamed BunI shamefully cheated super hard at this. I just used a biscuit tube took  biscuits formed them into two disks and put them in a bamboo steamer which I subsequently placed into a pan with some simmering water and checked them now and then until they felt pretty set.Assembled that shit garnished with cilantro.,tonightsdinner,cl8szuk,4,t5_2qxea

She will add the sauce to pasta and then proceed to chop the daylight out of it with her wooden spatula. Serve it with kosher dill pickles. I always thought growing up everyone ate spaghetti that way. The only thing I could never replicate is how her sauce tasted.

I counted  rabbits edging the neighboring field of wild rose hedges!  cotton tails hanging around visible! They are not a population to be knocked down around here! I may try some trapping....,tonightsdinner,d3hffi4,1,t5_2qxea

8516384,0,t3_4wdg49,Recipe kind of thrown together. This is an excellent meal for eyeballing!Make the avocado puree. First send one or two roughly chopped avocados two avocados made WAY more puree than we can eat two scallions with juice of two limes through a food processor until smooth. Add a bit of olive oil and continue adding until the puree reaches your desired consistency. Season with salt pepper and cayenne powder optional.Make the soba noodles according to package instructions. Rinse under cold water. In a large bowl add sliced cucumber I cut mine into thick halfmoons. Add  tablespoons soy sauce one tablespoon rice wine vinegar and  tablespoon sesame oil. Add a sprinkling of sugar. Finally add a few healthy shakes of gochugaru I love this stuff so I really go nuts. Add the noodles to the bowl and mix well to coat the noodles in the sauce. Taste and add salt if necessary. Chill.Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat add the torn maitake mushrooms in a single layer and cook on both sides until browned and crispy. Remove from pan. Wipe out pan.Heat a bit more olive oil and add salmon skin side UP and cook until the flesh is browned. Flip and cook until the skin is crispy and the salmon is cooked to your desired temperature.Serve...Divide the noodles between two plates. Add a spoon of avocado puree in kind of a paintbrush looking layer beside the noodles. Gently place the salmon on top of the avocado. Sprinkle a little or a lot more gochugaru over the whole plate. Top with thinly sliced scallions. ENJOY!,tonightsdinner,d663vnk,4,t5_2qxea

8998215,0,t1_d7sh4ym,Sorry I was too lazy or in too much of a food coma to type the recipe.Stock  large pigs trotters including lower leg cut into  inch chunks. . kilos oxtail. . kilos beef shin.  stalks of lemongrass bashed with back of knife to release flavour.  tsp sea salt.  tsp MSG.  tsps fish sauce.  tsp palm sugar. This made about  liters of stock.Seasoning   tbsp finely chopped lemongrass.  tbsp finely chopped garlic.  tsp ground annatto seeds in paste I used homemade by MIL but you can also use store bought it just wont have the same pungency. Dried chili amount dependent on your own tolerance.  tsp fermented shrimp paste.Accompaniments  Banana blossom optional if you can find it I tried using a large flower bud from my garden but it was too early in its development and was too bitter to use. Bean sprouts. Green onions. Cilantro also good is mint and Thai basil. Fresh limes. Dipping sauce made from chili garlic sauce palm sugar lime juice shrimp paste and stock.Directions Blanche all meat in boiling water for  minutes to get rid of impurities discard water and rinse meat and stock pot. This also means that you will have to do less skimming when simmering your stock. place meat in stock pot and fill with new water add lemongrass stalks and simmer on lowmedium partially covered for at least  hours longer the better.Saut all seasoning ingredients together be careful not to burn the chili as it will go bitter. Add seasoning to stock and allow to meld together for  minutes. Add sugarfish sauce to taste once lime is added it should have a perfect balance of sweetsourspicy. Serve on top of bun noodles and place accompaniments on top. Slurp it up and enjoy!,tonightsdinner,d7tg2di,1,t5_2qxea

9122486,0,t1_d88d18q,the edges were a bit crispy but not burnt at all.  The sauce on the bottom prevented the bottom layer from crisping at all so I think I might coat the sides with just a little bit of sauce next time.  If it were my mother cooking though she would WANT to leave the edges crispy or even slightly burnt.  Everyone has their preferences,tonightsdinner,d88dgqz,3,t5_2qxea
