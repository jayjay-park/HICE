7081242,0,t3_4cfspy,dont bite off more than you can chew.. keep to the stages that you can full auto.. tanks are pretty important because if you have enough DEF regular creeps damage to it is only  or  damage per hit.. dont worry too much on trying for the higher levels.. the exp increase will probably be less than  which is not really a lot.. farm mostly for bounties so you can run the exp bounty for quick level ups..,HeroesWanted,d1j0v8h,1,t5_30ij9
