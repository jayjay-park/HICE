It really depends on your level and pocket. There are many many things to consider when getting into business particularly if you are in for the long haul and want to leverage the most of your time and maximize the opportunity here are some of the criteria you perhaps need to consider .What most folks dont realise is if they are serious about ecommerce they really need enterprise grade architecture that allow you to systemize automate and play in the most markets possible. In previous years this level of platform with all the configuration module was normally prohibitive to the average startup or small business. Now the cost of entry is as little as  a month take a peek on Shopping Cart Elite,shopify,cqfrhfl,1,t5_2sn78

7999907,0,t1_d4ezg67,This was not through support we used Aweber at the time although now I would recommend ActiveCampaigns their starter plan is only month so it should still fit in you budget. It was automated but in the email tool side instructions are simple the tool will ask you to be place pixels where you want so on the cart and thank you page for example depending on your set up and if you set it to  min for first email itll check  min after they have landed on cart page after email submit and if they have not also visited the thankyou page then it will begin the sequence of emails till it detects they have visited the thank you page.We never got anyone angry at us remember these were people so interested they started the buying sequence and entered their email. Plus all emails have an unsubscribe button. Honestly people appreciated the emails we got a larger volume of inbound calls from those return email customers than initial customers mainly asking general product questions.,shopify,d4f9kox,1,t5_2sn78
8520973,0,t3_4twzy8,This a great post. I think if you are targeting influencers and celebs you need a referral marketing app to keep track of all the referred sales these influencers send you so that you can give them an appropriate commission.

8918084,0,t1_d7jl3nq,You can use the liquid inventoryquantity variable thats attached to the product object its nested in each variant object see the docs for more info. It gets a little bit more complicated if you have more than one variant since you would have to update the inventory with javascript when you change variants. But if you only have one variant you can just do something like Only  product.variants.first.inventoryquantity  leftTo show the quantity left. If you want to show sold out when  remaining then just do an if statement like product.variants.first.inventoryquantity   Sold Out else Only  product.variants.first.inventoryquantity  left endif Hope that helps keep the questions coming if you got them ,shopify,d7jtn6x,1,t5_2sn78

10266935,0,t3_5msjnj,I had the Retina Theme by OOTS got it from someone on Fiverr and Ella Theme by Themeforest. I bought Ella because it looked really nice and its much cheaper as compared to the premium themes by Shopify.I tried out the Ella theme for my first store. It had a lot of features and I took quite some time to customize the store. I ended up changing to the free theme called Supply because I felt that the theme wasnt userfriendly on mobile and it was laggy. As for the Retina theme I love it a lot and you wont take up much time to customize the design. As far as I know Travis Patelle uses the Retina theme for his tshirt store and Lawrence Aponte uses the Supply theme for one of his stores. The supply theme might not look fancy but if its bringing you sales why not? Hope this helps.,shopify,dc7ta8q,1,t5_2sn78
