189832,0,t1_cf0059c,EQ Traders Corner used to be the best tradeskill site for EQ I assume the EQ one is probably still good. Theres a link there on the left for Tradeskill Guides which are probably still relevant and correct. In game at the starting area there should be someone with a harvesting quest. That should chain to your home town where someone in the crafting area will do the intro to crafting quest. This will have you make an item from each type of crafting give you some recipes etc. Basically you need a recipe from a book some are purchased some are found then youll need some kind of vendor item fuel like coal or kindling or paper sold at the vendor very cheap and some harvested items stonewoodskinsvegetablesetc. Then you go to the crafting station forge woodworking bench scribing table and find the recipe you want pick the items you want to use in it sometimes you have options of what type of material to use I guess? and start crafting.  When youre crafting there are  bars that matter. The top bar green is Durability. This is how good the item youre making is. This bar starts full and empties over time. You want this to stay as full as possible. Not only to get a better end product but youll fail if it gets too low. The bar right underneath that is Progress Blue I think. That starts empty and fills up as you work. Your goal is to fill the blue Progress bar while keeping the green Durability bar as full as possible. You do this by mashing buttons. Theres six at the bottom and each does something slightly different. The  on the left increase Durability the  on the right increase Progress. As youre crafting the station will pulse every  sec or so making a noise and shooting numbers out of the top. Try to time your buttons to just after this happens because sometimes there will be a complication. Thats the bad icon that appears just above your six buttons. When one of them appears you want to hit one of the two buttons you have that matches it. If you do this so the first skill you use after the complication appears matches then something good happens. If not something bad happens. ,EQ2,cf0285r,1,t5_2r4sq

I see a large bounty of raid content for me to progress through as well as some old raid zones being revamped for top level gameplay.

5340067,1,t3_3o5oup,After weeks of attempting Brell and not figuring out why was the contested Avatar of Brell healing sometimes and not healing and after telling Carlos Mora a.k.a. Gninja the developer who designed this encounter that there were workarounds of reviving in this fight we got told that the fight is working as intended and that he wasnt going to put any more time into changing this encounter.Not getting any warnings or told ingame or out that what we were doing is wrong we continued pulling the encounter and getting close to killing it.After members of competing guild Revelations made alternate characters and moved them to Brells platform to spy on us with names like Agiko Xnokrad Mirgom Overpowered and harass us between pulls when they noticed we were getting close to killing it they petitioned Carlos MoraGninja to have us suspended. Carlos Mora complied with Revelations request and gave us all a suspension. Even members of our guild that werent part of the raid but were spectating got suspended.To us its a clear abuse of power specially to paying customers who have diligently and loyally played this game for  years. We have beta tested many of Everquests  expansions and helped all the different developers in whatever way we can to make this game what we considered to be the best MMO in the market. We got banned for doing something that a number of different guilds have also done in the past like Contested Prexus. If zerging was a bannable offense that had serious repercussions somewhere in the Terms of Service or any Developer could have contacted us and given us a warning for doing so.Also for anyone wanting a little bit of context on this encounter and why we were so frustrated with it and with Carlos MoraGninja.. The mob is impossible to kill with  players. You need to bring  or less players to be able to kill him. This got many people upset that they were not allowed to be in raid when normally they would have been able to raid like every other raid encounter due to Brells damaging AoE mechanic.. The mob has two specific emotes that has been in the encounter since its implementation. a. First emote The Avatar gainsregains his connection to underfoot any damage dealt to him will be healed. b. Second emote The Avatar loses his connection to underfoot he can once again be damaged!. With both those emotes it WAS clear to us that theres a red lightgreen light mechanic to this fight. If you attacked him while he had his connection he would get healed. Problem was that sometimes he would get healed and sometimes he didnt. We were wondering why this inconsistency was happening and couldnt figure out why. The problem which was mentioned to Carlos MoraGninja multiple times was that if you actually followed the red lightgreen light script you wouldnt be able to kill Brell in his  minute enrage timer. The damage windows from his Healing Shield being active and inactive were very small and it wouldnt allow any guild to kill him within that timeframe so it was obvious to us that you had to do damage to him while the Healing Shield was active in order to kill him within the  minutes.  . We contacted Carlos Mora via Private Messages about this situation about its inconsistencies and we even showed him video proof about the evidence. He ignored our requests and told us that the fight would remain as is leaving us with the question about why was Brell healing sometimes and other times he wasnt.. Other guilds like Revelations figured out what was exactly causing this mob to heal before anyone else. The managed to get the World Wide first kill on it after figuring out this encounter mechanic and used it to their advantage to kill it first.. After  weeks of trial and error and frustrations we finally managed to figure out what was causing Brell to heal to full health. The different Max Health Debuffs that various classes have were causing Brell to heal while the Healing Shield was activated. If none of the raid members used a Max Health Debuff while the shield was active his health would continually go down. Finally relieved that we figured out this MISLEADING emote of Brell we managed to get him close to killing him.. Eventually Carlos MoraGninja appeared during our raid pull and despawned Brell because we were exploiting and subsequentially had everyone present from Fatality banned even spectators.Moral of the Story? Dont believe what the Developers tell you and certainly dont trust them. They can make rules and policies on the fly to get people banned for something that was perfectly legal ingame for  years. A group of loyal players for  years who have consistently collaborated and donated their free time Beta Testing EQ for many years are suddenly chastised and banned.,EQ2,cvu93k0,0,t5_2r4sq

5833142,0,t3_3v24ei, Currently on the second expansion with the third likely to be released in about  weeks. The PVP server is very quiet. A number of guilds are essentially on maintenance mode until the release of the next expansion.  From your post it looks like youre interested in PVP. Deathtoll is MUCH quieter than the PVE server. I would suggest rolling in the evil faction if you do come it has a higher population. Population has gotten better over the last week but is nowhere near what it used to be. There is no PVP gear. It may be introduced in two expansions. Raiding is easier than it was when the servers were live. The reasons for this is that adjustments have been made as the game has progressed some mob scripts were changed and gear was retrospectively improved. This means people outgear content that used to be quite hard making it much easier. There werent as many scripted raid fights in the early days of EQ which makes the easy raid zones trivial. That being said few guilds have cleared the two final instances of the expansion because they involve scriptsmore coordination. All in all the raiding should get progressively harder and there is hope that they will be adjusting the difficult of future raid encounters based on player feedback.The game is rewarding. It has far more class complexity than other MMOs. There is more to do and more to learn. The problem is that the server is in the doldrums until the next expansion but if you want to be of level to enjoy that content youre better off starting now.I would suggest holding off until KoS unless you can find a friend to join you to help you through the earlier content. Its more fun with a friend anyway ,EQ2,cxk92pc,2,t5_2r4sq
