6974963,0,t1_d16mryh,I actually dont believe in taking supplements without a doctors recommendation. I was merely pointing out that one vitamin gets you all the healthy micronutrients that people think they need to have. I dont make a concerted effort to eat one way or the other i just eat what i want. Its fast food maybe  times a week and rarely is it something like mcdonalds just because I dont care for it. Itll be chipotle pei wei taco bell or pizza most of the time. The other days Ill cook something interesting cause i like to change it up a lot. I use lots of butter sugar when necessary and whatever else because theres no such thing as healthy food. If youre  pounds and you cant help but eat way too fucking many calories in a day then maybe you need to limit yourself to broccoli but if youre an average person who doesnt eat too much and gets a good amount of exercise then you can do whatever. Ive been an athlete my whole life and I once proved a point to a lot of naysayers by dieting down and working out hard and getting pretty damn ripped by eating whatever I wanted in controlled portions. Id go to mcdonalds and just have one hamburger or taco bell and only have one burrito. Its not that hard. And its just as healthy as anything. ,GifRecipes,d16y746,1,t5_3410y

7566389,1,t1_d3257mm,Well it is compared to just buying all the ingredients yourself honestly its pretty hard to mess up your ingredients if you got a proper recipe and something to measure with.For example something I dont understand is why my neighbour keeps baking applepies from a packet thats literally just sugar self rising flour and some vanilla flavouring and coming from someone thats been making cakes and pies from scratch together with my mother at first since as long as they can remember the hardest part while making an apple pie actually is kneading and forming the dough to fit your baking tin honestly its kinda silly she can do that but not measure out  ingredients and add a packet of vanilla sugar. That said starting of with a baking mix might be less intimidating but honestly as soon as you start making something more often one should google a recipe and make it from scratch its not much harder  of the time and imo just tastes way better. ,GifRecipes,d329frn,1,t5_3410y

8488305,0,t3_4vur54,Not OP but these recipes are fairly simple. I gathered some basic recipes from the interwebs that could make this fairly easily and tastily. Eclair doughpaste pte a choux   cup milk  tbsp butter  tbsp sugar  cup flour  egg looks like there might actually be two...From what I see in the gif Preheat oven to  Warm the milk butter and sugar until just bubbling turn off heat and fully combine flour. remove from heat and add egg stir to fully combine. Smush into a piping bag and pipe lines of choux onto a baking sheet probably want this greased or lined with parchment. Bake at  for  minutes. Allow to cool while making pastry cream filling and caramel sauce.Pastry Cream from another recipe   cups whole milk heavy cream or a mix  cup sugar  cup flour  teaspoon salt  large egg yolks  teaspoon vanilla extractWarm the milk Warm the milk in the saucepan until you start to see wisps of steam. It should not actually be boiling.Make the eggsugar base In a medium bowl whisk together the sugar flour and salt. Add the egg yolks and whisk them into the dry ingredients. This will form a thick paste. Its fine if the paste looks crumbly or smooth the important thing is that the ingredients are thoroughly combined.Add the milk to the egg mixture Pour a little of the hot milk into the eggs and whisk to combine. Continue pouring the milk slowly into the eggs whisking continuously. Its OK to switch back and forth between pouring milk and whisking if you cant manage both at the same time.Pour everything back in the pan When all the milk has been added to the eggs pour everything back into the saucepan. Set a strainer over a bowl and place this near the stove.Heat the pastry cream Set the pan back over medium heat. Whisk constantly. At first the pastry cream will look very thin and frothy but it will start to thicken after a few minutes. When it has thickened to a puddinglike consistency pause whisking every few seconds to see if the cream has come to a boil. If you see large bubbles popping on the surface whisk for a few more seconds and then remove the pan from heat.Strain and cool the pastry cream Stir the vanilla into the pastry cream and then pour the cream into the strainer set over the bowl. Stir to push it through the strainer. This will catch any bits of cooked egg that may be in your pastry cream.Cover and store Cover the pastry cream with a piece of plastic wrap pressed right up against the surface of the cream and chill completely.Caramel from another recipe  packed cup brown sugar  cup halfandhalf  tablespoons butter Pinch salt  tablespoon vanilla extractMix the brown sugar halfandhalf butter and salt in a saucepan over mediumlow heat. Cook while whisking gently for  to  minutes until it gets thicker. Add the vanilla and cook another minute to thicken further. Turn off the heat cool slightly and pour the sauce into a jar.

Thick copper bases also retain heat better which is needed for some electric coil stoves that merely maintain an average heat by turning on and turning off.I personally use stainless steel pans because Im a bit of a chemophobe and I straight up do not trust the safety of nonstick coatings especially from materials that may have been sourced from China.

Sometimes you forgot to add a crucial ingredient.  For Cooking Gif recipes be sure to check out the source recipe and not just cook according to the image by itself.

To make the filling combine all ingredients and pour into the tart shell.. Bake in the preheated oven for  minutes. Check the tart every  minutes or so by tapping the top of the filling to eliminate any film forming on the top. The tart will be done when the crust is golden and the filling is a beautiful caramel color. . Remove from oven and allow to cool. .

It has happened to me before when the chocolate just straight up stiffened up instead of yielding a nice and smooth ganache.

11228629,0,t1_df4qf0l,Ive used just about every brand. The variance is minimal. Were talking dried herbs here. The difference is nowhere near enough to alter a recipe if you use another brand. It is common practice to include these blends in recipes. Even professional chefs do so. Sure you could break it down into exact amounts of thyme oregano etc. But it wouldnt change the recipe and most people keep italian seasoning on hand.  I have italian seasoning but dont have dried oregano on hand because most recipes I use it in also call for a combination of it and thyme and other spices or italian seasoning. I have fresh versions of these herbs in my garden as well but wouldnt dream of drying them to use individually in simple recipes like this where I could just use italian seasoning. Its a matter of practicality and realizing that not every recipe is complex enough to warrant the extra work. The results will be the same.,GifRecipes,df4r0oo,13,t5_3410y

11337629,0,t3_61rq8l,Ok having married into a Cornish family and been forcibly educated out of my emmet ways taken lessons with my husbands granny as well as a pasty making lesson with Eunice Woolcock high priestess of pasties at the Stithians County Show I have notes if youre making a proper job Cornish pasty.  ONLY white pepper and salt as seasoning. No black pepper! Apparently this is tantamount to being from Devon. The veg needs to be sliced into chips about the size and thickness of a pound coin never ever diced. Dicing is the Devils work. You want it to all lie flat when in the pasty itself.  The meat always goes on top so the gravy drips down inside the pasty over the veg. And for a traditional steak pasty the veg must only be potato swede the Cornish call it turnip just to be confusing and onion no carrots. No allbutter pastry maximum half butter! All butter is too crumbly you need it to be stretchy enough to crimp. You can make up the other half with suet trex stork or even marge. From personal experience half stork and half suet Atora is the best combination. Butter is too crumbly to do a proper crimp. Also you want to use at least half strong white bread flour. The pasty in the gif doesnt have a proper crimp I think because its an allbutter pastry dough. It should look like a rope around the edge or over the top of the pastyChons da with your pasties everyone Kernow bys vyken!,GifRecipes,dfh3mpb,292,t5_3410y
