1384716,0,t3_29yxc0,Look like native bees. But I dont know how to get them out without just killing them which sucks.,bees,cipuv28,3,t5_2qpf4
1390855,0,t1_ciqkt8w,I posted to  but there are no responses to any recent posts to the page so Im not sure that route is going to be very fruitful. ,bees,ciqmi44,1,t5_2qpf4
1611208,0,t1_cji5lhh,Wow. Ill just google that than. Thanks ,bees,cji9db0,1,t5_2qpf4
1990881,0,t1_cksvvkr,Yeah and males drones only exist to spread the hives DNA. They die in the act. Good to be human. Cool pic.,bees,ckt3nne,1,t5_2qpf4
3516904,0,t1_cpt5cf3,Lol yes its dark. I wasnt sure if you wanted pictures of the bees or the bushes. Here are the bushes. I tried to take a picture of the bees earlier but I didnt want to get too close. I didnt think there was really a need to. My three year old is crazy. He may actually try to hold or smash them. Parenting is fun. ,bees,cpt5ivo,1,t5_2qpf4
4024044,0,t3_36l56x,Do they live there or are they just there recently?  Above ground and they are just looking for a place to fly away to.  Should be gone soon.  Call a beekeeper to get them before they fly away.  Gonna be a fat queen in there.If they live in the ground and have lived there a long time and havent bothered you they should be fine.  Get them removed anyways.  Google for bee removal in your area.You are saying carpet of bees and havent mentioned past history so Im assuming they are new and are just waiting to find a place to fly away to.  Its a swarm.  Swarms are good and nice.  Call a beekeeper.  Bees need beekeepers.,bees,creyyxd,1,t5_2qpf4
4466176,0,t3_3ca1tf,I reckon its Homo Millifera ,bees,cstmznf,1,t5_2qpf4
4628750,0,t1_ctdwmqr,Maybe the ones who havent done one before...  Its an incredible amount of work and its a trick to keep them from flying away or keep them alive alive afterwards.  I dont know anyone doing it for free anymore.,bees,cte0wxr,1,t5_2qpf4
5136007,0,t1_cv519tb,Thats weird usually the yellow is quite vivid against the black. It may be best to get a pest controller in to find the best kill it off then seal where theyre getting in when its all dead. ,bees,cv52wks,1,t5_2qpf4
5259351,0,t1_cvjxf95,Haha not at all. I have no clue about bees. But I do know they are very passive. There are all over sometimes and they never attack.  Would you recommend I have someone come remove them?,bees,cvjxuzv,1,t5_2qpf4
5690346,0,t3_3sw96l,I think that  of seeds is no where near enough to make any difference to your bees or the butterfly. You need to plant in terms if acres to matter. If you are planting less than acres they best you could do is replace your lawn with a flowering ground cover like clover or plant something that blooms during a dearth in your area.,bees,cx2fy86,1,t5_2qpf4
6543802,0,t3_456wea,Interesting that one of the few places that didnt have access to the neonic pesticides isnt having a bee die off problem.  ,bees,czw6kn6,1,t5_2qpf4
6953450,0,t1_d14fwgl,Yes I know.  I just posted the difference.  Why are you stuck on the word wasp?,bees,d14i7zb,1,t5_2qpf4
7005692,0,t3_4bm0ko,I read the study cited by the article and it didnt test artificially pollinated plants at all. It only compared beepollinated plants to windpollinated plants and selfpollinated plants as in plants that pollinate themselves. The results are very interesting but its a mystery to me why the researchers didnt test this.,bees,d1afuck,2,t5_2qpf4

7621305,0,t3_4jl2mq,I dont feed ever. Id rather my bees die than rely on me feeding them sugar to survive. Also entrance reducers wont do much this time of year to help your bees. All they are good for is to prevent pests from getting in during the winter.,bees,d38i3pa,2,t5_2qpf4
7624243,0,t3_4hs0zr,There are so me diseases that can cause this. Usually theyre bound to certain species. That doesnt look like a honey bee so I dont think its too worrisome.,bees,d38u3jd,2,t5_2qpf4
7649651,0,t3_4k31r9,Neat. Looks like its made to drip the honey down. ,bees,d3bq1d5,1,t5_2qpf4

8423555,0,t3_4uzosw,Like the others have said its a bit late in the season. Youre best bet is to take the time to study up and start your hives next year. The books Chesty mentions helped my wife and I a lot when we started  years ago. When you are completely hooked read Thomas Seeleys Honeybee Democracy. He describes how bees actually vote on their next home. It wont help with practical upkeep but understanding the bees a bit more is never a bad thing either.  The only other thing I would recommend is joining a local beekeepers club if possible. That way you can get advice specific to your area and you have some experts available if anything goes wrong with your hives.  Good luck!,bees,d5uhibj,2,t5_2qpf4
8645113,0,t1_d6jur89,I too hope you are wrong. It was not aggressive at all thank goodness! Thank you! ,bees,d6m90ul,1,t5_2qpf4
8645145,0,t1_d6jur89,Hi so I checked the link and fortunately I dont think it is an Asian Hornet. This bee or wasp or hornet was yellower and furrier than what was pictured. It was also not aggressive even when I got up on it for pictures with the flash. Thanks for your input! ,bees,d6m961q,1,t5_2qpf4
8738074,0,t1_d6xtwt1,They usually have a grey ball shaped hive hanging from somewhere. I dont think they live underground but its possible. Theyre not overly aggressive but you shouldnt go upsetting them. ,bees,d6xwpyg,1,t5_2qpf4
9948531,0,t1_db46zck,No not until its older but my wife wants it during the pregnancy. ,bees,db4bi5z,2,t5_2qpf4
10625238,0,t1_ddbss99,Thank you! Unfortunately our HOA wont allow them. But when we move Im going to do it!,bees,ddbwumo,3,t5_2qpf4
