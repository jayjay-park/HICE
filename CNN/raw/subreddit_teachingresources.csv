319985,0,t3_1xrdl7,I wanted to share this grant program because it really is amazing for what you get. I use Reflex in my classroom and was one of the receivers of the grant in my district. My students started at  with multiplication and division fluency at the beginning of the year. They have worked on Reflex for about  months now and my class is at  fluency overall with  students at  of the original . I then switched those who reached  fluency to addition and subtraction to build fluency there.This program is games based and will adapt to your students levels. Students love playing the games to earn tokens and buying things for their avatar and progress tree.In the classroom I definitely notice a difference. Teaching the multiplication and division unit in th grade was pretty painless compared to years past. Plus I have found students have a much easier time with the fractions units we are currently doing. Give it a shot! Applications end on the st!,teachingresources,cfdxpdi,1,t5_2w9jj
