3378719,0,t1_cpdc3ap,Thanks Jazjustice! It sounds like the darker metal heads in the s and s got their information from the larger cities where the metal scene was happening at a larger scale. I wonder if you remember how you heard about Metalfest how did you follow the metal scene? On the radio? Magazines or other subscriptions?Maybe JCD was from a big city maybe not. But maybe if we follow your great idea and attend shows in the big cities our search will be more effective and fun! And maybe when we find JCD we can attend shows in his honor!,Janesville,cpdedw1,2,t5_2sfd5
