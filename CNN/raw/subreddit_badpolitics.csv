This leads into the broader point that encouraging everyday use to appeal to sources like dictionaries as beallandendall authorities in these sorts of issues is a questionable practice promoting as it does a vulgar end of history style ideological conception of fixed absolute objective knowledge. Even framing it as a matter of academic knowledge versus everyday knowledge is problematic since no academic is an academic expert on everythingIf weve decided to agree that academics engaging in everyday public discourse is a worthwhile social endeavor or if weve decided to agree that academics even existing is a worthwhile social endeavor neither of which Im necessarily all that committed to but just for the sake of argument then the one proposition that should probably unite academics across disciplines is something like well its more complicated than that....

I suppose that anarchocapitalists or they should see the state as the thing which brings all of what is bad to capitalism and if capitalism is to improve the state must be gotten rid of.

7265265,0,t1_d1xtvyu,I think that axis is somewhat alright actually. Some people believe that some other people are just born bad. This can motivate long prison sentences to keep these people away from the general population. Often this is mixed with racism where they believe some races are born bad.On the other hand you have people who believe people turn bad because of how society treats them. These people would rather that prisons focus on rehabilitation. Taken further they believe that society can be radically changed while the former group would believe that this is impossible as the shape of society follows from the innate nature of people.,badpolitics,d240cl3,2,t5_2sifg

7335705,0,t3_4ft78q,While the theory may have some application its applied far too indiscriminately and simplistically on reddit as shorthand for those who simply dont want to learn what different groups stand for.  Bear in mind the phrase partially came about only in the past  years as a way to describe antiSemitism among far left and far right groups which glosses over the different rationales used.  Virulent antiSemitic conspiracy theories also find root among many who are antiestablishment including the generally apolitical.I cant speak as to European politics as much as American politics but far left and far right groups here including those that operate within liberal capitalism have far more divergent grievances and platforms in part due to very different regional and demographic bases like the current OWSSanders base versus the Family Research Council.  The current success of the Trump campaign is also another confound to horseshoe theory at least for me as it is a mix of oldfashioned nativism with antiestablishment secularism drawing on both independents and Republicans.A regression analysis may help if your focus is European politics but I would caution against a continentallevel look equally across the board as even groups on the same end of the spectrum with the same platform in different countries can have huge objections to each other which can throw off your results.Also you may find more answers to your question on rasksocialscience as well as on StackExchange.,badpolitics,d2c0p9y,10,t5_2sifg

7556191,0,t3_4is4ll,Thats not the type of Conservatives that support Trump. Trumps supporters are the socalled Alternative Right which is a new type of Right Wing movement sprung from Paleoconservatism Fascism and Internet Culture. They came into existence around  or so and many of them are actually former Leftists who got disillusioned with the Left around the same time that the Julian Assange scandal broke. Most of them are Atheists and they have a close connection to nerd culture and nerdy right wing political causes like Gamergate. They also make use of Internet memes for propaganda purposes. chans pol FunnyJunk and DailyStormer are three major propaganda centers for the AltRight. Other than that they are openly racist Islamophobic and even Antisemitic. AntiEuropean sentiment is also strong in the American branch especially hatred of Germany and Sweden.The type of Conservative described in this article sunds like the typical Bushyears NeoConservative.
