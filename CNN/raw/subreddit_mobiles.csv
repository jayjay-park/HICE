4439485,0,t3_3bhjfy,I have a oneplus and I can say that it is amazing! Super fast great battery extremely cheap considering what you get. Its pretty large but I like that alot! I just think its better! I mean it easily fits in my pocket but its still big compared to other phones. I dont have any experience with the htc  but from what Ive seen I would definetly go for the OnePlus! ,mobiles,csqa5gf,1,t5_2qvrz
