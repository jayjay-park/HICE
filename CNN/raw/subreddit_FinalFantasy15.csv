9820232,0,t1_damk8nr,Also enable wait mode if you havent already.  It will temporarily pause combat to do things like change target scan enemies for weaknesses formulate a strategy use items and techniques and all sorts of things.  I have found it crucial to fighting higher level  enemies.If your in trouble just tap triangle or the warp button to get out of the way.  This also helps in flanking the enemy to get back attackschain attacks.  They do heavy damage.  You can also warp to safe spots to hang and replenish health by looking at them and holding trianglewarp.Eating will also give you nice temporary boosts for fights.,FinalFantasy15,danlf5e,1,t5_2wsz1
9825748,0,t1_dao9u91,I feel like thats gonna be me. I still have to do all the weapon upgrade quests too. Not sure where to get all the stuff. Plus I still have a couple hunts to do. But Im starting to get quests for areas that arent open to me yet so I think its about time to move on. ,FinalFantasy15,daobdt9,1,t5_2wsz1

9884780,0,t3_5gsu33,Chapter  screwed the game into a hurried ending.  I think it was a hurried finish or a huge miss to not open up  year world ala final fantasy . |,FinalFantasy15,daw0dyu,1,t5_2wsz1
9944200,0,t1_db3psue,Took me about  tries at the hunt before the horn dropped for me just keep after the big ones and youll get it! The weapon is more than worth the small time investment!,FinalFantasy15,db3r56l,1,t5_2wsz1
9949060,0,t1_db4cci6,...do you not remember the end scene where they wake up? I think they died fighting the daemons. ,FinalFantasy15,db4dzll,1,t5_2wsz1
10085780,0,t3_5k6a5b,I havent played a FF since . I attempted  and the mix in between I couldnt handle the writing nor character developments it was just crap. Bought  because Im giving Square Enix a chance and BAM! LOOOOOOOVE ! Got the season pass today. Ps pro ,FinalFantasy15,dbm71fg,1,t5_2wsz1
10103303,0,t3_5kikcb,After your first time manually driving you wont be able to again for a while except at night but I wouldnt recommend driving at night too much. Once you get to a certain point there will be a cutscenes where Ignis says he trusts you to drive. Later on you will also hit a point where Ignis trusts in your fighting ability enough for him to drive at night. ,FinalFantasy15,dboh0vt,1,t5_2wsz1

10266721,0,t3_5mx6x6,I disagree to a degree and agree to a degree. I had no questions left unanswered but then again I also watched Kingsglaive and the anime short  it filled a lot of blanks. But I do agree that the ending chapters felt rushed but thats ironically where the story began to hit the hardest. I think it all boils down to the switch in directors and direction one of them wanted an open world game and the other wanted a linear story driven game. We got something in between. I havent been hit this hard emotionally though since The Last of Us I felt very attached to Noctis and his buddies and even the side characters like Luna. Noctis was totally relatable just a kid whos lost everything and keeps losing everything but finds a way to fight through it with his friends. I lost it when he asks to take one of Promptos pictures with him and then you see the montage of everything they went through in the end credits only to be bombarded by one final cutscene of Noctis saying his final goodbyes. One thing is for sure  it definitely is a good building block for future Final Fantasy games. ,FinalFantasy15,dc7seqz,2,t5_2wsz1
10270568,0,t3_5n2imn,The combat reminds me of the witcher  a little bit but with relevant jumping. Lol But as of now the story is nowhere near as immersive. I like the game so far but its definitely lacking in story. Im kind of hoping the many dlcs planned add a lot more to the game. ,FinalFantasy15,dc88470,2,t5_2wsz1
10281700,0,t3_5mulo9,All about the timing. When it doesnt prompt you you just need to dodge. Most enemies telegraph their attacks just learn their patterns,FinalFantasy15,dc9hjlx,1,t5_2wsz1
10401827,0,t1_dcn0r47,You still have to wait for a quest to prompt before getting the key though.,FinalFantasy15,dcn43zb,2,t5_2wsz1
