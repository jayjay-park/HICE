5214604,0,t3_3meq19,Definitely check out Presque Isle. Not only is it a good SpringSummer destination its still open in the Winter and the cooler weather as well. Theres always opportunities to get good views of the lake sunset we have some of the best in the world different birdsanimals and boats too. Also the views of Downtown Erie are pretty great too. Sometimes on a really really clear day you can see Canada from the north side of the Peninsula. Pretty cool.Also if your interested Panama Rocks close by in New York state in Panama NY in Chautauqua County is really affordable and worth the visit. Its a beautiful scenic park that is perfect for hiking and taking amazing pictures. My wife and I try to visit every year.,Erie,cvejx5a,1,t5_2ruus

9286896,0,t3_57jxf5,I grew up north of Pittsburgh and came here for college. I loved it so stayed after graduation.  Theres a lot to love. Its really affordable. There is a lot to do especially if you like outdoor activities. Theres a blues and jazz festival every year quarterly gallery nights and much more. I just bought a house downtown and I think we will see the downtown continue to revitalize itself in coming years.  Even though its a high population of renters Id recommend you looking there.  Youll hear bad things about the lower East side but I think anything north of th street is okay. Send me a message if you want more information... my company may also have housing available. The crime might have increased last year but its not random and Ive never felt unsafe. ,Erie,d8t6j1c,5,t5_2ruus
