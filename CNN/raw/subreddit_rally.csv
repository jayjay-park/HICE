483870,0,t1_cfv84ax,I will check it out.  Thanks for polling the community for ideas.  It gives me some hope.I never meant to say the games were bad.  They were well designed and ran well as a sort of sim environment but still arcade race games.    They played well with a controller on xbox and I had fun with it back then.  It is just that Dirt  originally advertised itself as a great rally sim with all this claimed innovative technology that at one point bragged about its  surface textures sophisticated damage model and how deep the development for it was to make it work.   Some of it was truly cool like the deformable barriers visual car body damage and watermud effects on the windscreen which was pretty new for something on a console at the time.But when it came down to the driving experience the game had no clutch support no H shifter support loads of acceleration grip on loose stone artificially augmented gear ratios to fit the claimed speed and braking grip on dirt comparable to real life tarmac.  While it was interesting to play as a console racer it wasnt the sim I was told I was getting with all the hype.  It seemed either that the marketing was targeting the wrong segment or the developers missed what was supposed to be done.  It just seemed so incongruent.Then the later versions mostly stopped trying to pretend they were sims which at least allowed the game to have a clear direction.Considering  year old RBR models the combustion engine fully so temperature changes and damage effect the power output in addition to all kinds of other nutty things I just think it is a little embarrassing that with all the computing technology we have now that nobody can create something equal or better.,rally,cfv9ph3,11,t5_2qy4s

For the amount of transit timedistance required to get there on less than ideal roads it was a complete waste of time!Its also been left out of every recap and report that Ive read that two other stages were cancelled midway through the full field around when the Academy drivers were running.

4839756,0,t1_cu4hilq,Actually it differs in quite a few ways. WRC has never ever had vehicletovehicle communications between cars. The system used in WRC uses mixedmode GSM amp radio via a repeater plane flying overhead. This makes in fast and reliable when the weather is good but prohibitively expensive. The WRC is the only series in the world running this technology. RallySafe on the other hand comes at quite an inexpensive cost and offers similar functionality to the WRC system. We offer our services to a complete spectrum of rallies from club rallies all over NZ amp Aus all the way up to highprofile international events like the AsiaPacific Rally Championship rounds.Side note Coffs Coast in Australia is the ONLY WRC round which doesnt use the WRC tracking system for the regional competitors they use us. We sit in race control side by side with the WRC system and have a competition of our own. Its fun. Pic Edit Just wanted to point out that because RallySafe uses satellites we dont need any on the ground infrastructure to run an event. Weve tracked a car in the PekingtoParis rally and ran the tracking for the last SydneytoLondon event without a hassle. Thats simply not possible with the technology the WRC are using.,rally,cu4l82l,3,t5_2qy4s

7921142,0,t3_4nrez8,To be fair hes still leading the championship by a huge margin. And hes had a bit going on with the baby coming and all. But my guess is hes lost a bit of motivation because he really really doesnt like these road position rules but everyone is against him on that and basically tells him to suck it up including Jarmo Mahonen the FIA Rally director boss man.If it were me I would be extremely snarky to the other drivers and hostile to the media between bouts of drinking and threatening to quit the sport.

10423660,0,t3_5p0l87,I did yearly then went monthly last year then cancelled entirely this year.The stages being broadcast they say up to  hours but usually less than that are randomly livestreamed and theres insufficient headsup up as to whats going to be broadcast and when. The first year I sent them an email about providing better information about the times because they showed a time but no indication whether it was local GMT or resolved to the local viewers  IP address. I think they fixed it last year but you had to constantly keep checking the web site to get a fix on what was upcoming. Its like they randomly were choosing a stage to broadcast only a couple days or even hours before the event. Very hard to track. And after all of that trouble youd still get only one livestreamed stage for a stage rally. ,rally,dcpla7b,1,t5_2qy4s

The level of stupidity is baffling. Now because they cant really reverse regulations they just introduced and spent months touting as an exciting rebirth of the sport they decide to pussify the stages which are already a fraction of what they used to be.
