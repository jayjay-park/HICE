1246276,0,t3_28d42q,Not sure if this is what youre looking for but here goesWell today I had my last exam for this semester and it was the hardest one Ive had yet. I had to get up at six oclock in order to catch a train just after seven. Pulling myself out of bed was almost physically impossible. And my eyes immediately took on that stinging soreness that happens when youre extremely tired or just havent gotten enough sleep. Showering didnt help soothe them and waiting on the cold train station platform didnt help either. My eyes were determined to reflect my irritated and anxious mood.As for the exam itself well I probably could have done better. I did some hardcore revision in the days leading up to the exam but despite that I just didnt feel like I knew anything about the texts. Oh! And we the students were completely screwed over by the people who chose what texts were to be on section B the passage analysis this was a Literature exam at a University level. We were told I swear that wed either be writing on poem A or poem B. What do we get? Poem C that featured in one lecture for about twenty seconds whereas A and B both had two lectures and a tutorial each devoted to studying them. I was absolutely furious. But I suppose that kind of stuff happens in University sometimes. This is only my first year so I really dont know.Not to mention I missed my train home because we were let out of so late. It was cold wet raining and miserable so I jumped on the next closest train a outer city train the one I missed was a rural train that headed in the direction of home.There was a massive highlight to the day though. Taking the city train left me in the town where my boyfriend lives. We met up for a few minutes before a rural train came through the station and he brought me a travel mug full of tea not just any tea but my favourite Irish Breakfast and a packet of Lindt chocolates. I swear hes a saint. After that I was finally on the right train home and I spent the rest of the day playing minecraft with my boyfriend and a couple of his mates or sketching. I did one sketch of a woman in an archway fiddling with her wedding dress that I quite liked. Because of my exams I havent done any drawing or creative writing for that matter for a few weeks. So I was pleasantly surprised that my skills had not gotten too dull from their short neglect. After dinner I was going to make a cheesecake and let it set overnight so that I could take it to my Bible study group tomorrow but I didnt have any fresh eggs. For the recipe I wanted to make I couldnt use older eggs because the chocolate filling is not baked. But I might be able to make it next week. So that should be good.The rest of this week shouldnt be as bad though I have no more exams for well over two months and I might be seeing some old friends on Thursday and Friday.Also Im Australian so I apologise for any weird spelling.,WritersDustbin,ci9tl4u,3,t5_326qy
