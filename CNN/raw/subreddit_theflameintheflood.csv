6861769,0,t1_d0t8xb2,Its really hard to say without a realtime counter ingame but I estimated that it took me  days playing hrs a night to make it to  days  almost exactly  miles. Probably another few days of hrs sessions to make it all the way to  days. I could be overshooting that estimate a bit Im not sure.,theflameintheflood,d0u3al3,1,t5_33xf2
10937938,0,t1_de7tlep,The real trick is you dont get to stop on islands even ones that look like they have a building or something interesting on them.You get to stop at specific waypoints theyre very obvious in the UI If youre not sure its not a waypoint.  For some reason they dont have the first of those for a long time so new players spend forever crashing into islands trying to figure out how to land.  Just keep heading downstream until things start popping up in the UI.,theflameintheflood,de866vy,2,t5_33xf2
