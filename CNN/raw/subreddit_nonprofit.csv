68462,0,t1_celxr4b,Ha well that leads me to my bigger criticism of the whole unpaid internship market. I work in fundraising in higher education and the paces that students and recent graduates go through trying to find workexperience and are instead are exploited for free labor is pretty sickening. We actually have a small attempting to grow fund that offers stipends to make unpaid internships paid for our students so they can you know eat and live. Ignoring the moral implications of such work opportunities like this if used in the right way can really be an eye opening experience. Understanding the constraints put on fulltime gift entryacknowledgment personnel can only improve how you plan and do your work from a gift officermajor gift officer perspective. If you know what goes into soliciting and stewarding a donor from the smallest donation to the largest you will be ahead of the crowd. And can also have a deep appreciation for the admins who work off their butts to make sure your stuff gets handled correctly and in a timely manner.Best of luck to you! ,nonprofit,cem82e5,1,t5_2qlfy

Seemed more like he just wanted to mention kiva and a dirty word in the same sentence.  He does have one valid point  there isnt clear evidence that microfinance works in the sense that it reduces poverty.  We struggle with this and focus on how to increase our impact every day.  Had he stuck with that there could have been an interesting discussion.

510323,0,t3_1zrea6,gtIm curious why there arent more businesses like this already too.Because running a successful business is hard enough when you are keeping  of your profits.  Most new businesses fail.  Many successful businesses operate at razerthin profit margins  one unforeseen disaster such as a fire or a flood or a medical emergency of a key employee can bring down the business.  Because of the risk involved in any startup it can be difficult to secure initial funding.  If your business model includes a  payout of your sales you are intentionally making yourself more risky  which means it will be harder to get funding either angel investors or even a line of credit at a bank.  So basically this business model is intentionally more risky when the underlying activity is already extremely risky.  Thats why.Good luck by the way with your endeavor!

2581631,0,t3_2pby8m,If you can get businesses to donate things that are similar to your mission that would help. Both because your constituents are more likely to want them and the businesses gain some good publicity to a sympathetic audience by being associated with your cause.  For example if you are an animal shelter you might put the most work to finding donations of pet portraits pet food certificate for yearly vet exam trips to a rural animal sanctuary etc.  For an ethnic cultural center you could find artwork from artists of that ethnicity a catered meal or dinner from a restaurant that serves the cultures food etc. Also the things that go the best are ones where people feel they are getting a really good deal for something they might not always know how to find or afford. For example if you can get a famous artist whose work that normally sells for  to donate a small work or a printedition where the bidding starts at  or  that will go really fast!

The specific arrangement isnt verboten but it can create problems and it certainly doesnt look good.If they are independent contractors then its less of a problem to have their fee be based on the gross receipts for a particular revenue stream although I would personally be more inclined towards a flat fee for services instead of a commission arrangement.

3371200,0,t3_2ysj4t,I think that two of the biggest factors in deciding whether you will be successful are. Do you believe in the organizations mission? Are they truly providing a good service or for a good cause? Do you get the sense that the community feels the same way? . Do you have resources at your disposal for shouldering the burden of these various tasks? For example you can accomplish a lot more high level direction if you are given a budget to work with vendors for things like event planning direct mail and even majorplanned giving marketing. If you are offered this position I would ask them what resources you could use to accomplish all of these initiatives. Can you hire an outside vendor? Eventually another employee? A lowcost intern? Each one of these tasks on their own could be someones entire job at a larger organization particularly fundraising. Tell them you want to be able to accomplish the goal of raising more money than current intake but you need to be realistic. And would you have someone to direct you and keep you focused on the organizations goals and helping to build strategic plans for accomplishing those goals?

An NPO in this area could focus initially on something as simple as getting citizens more access to that process by hosting plans and options and comparisons on a website. in all likelihood this is already being done...to some degree or another...in your area. If you can nail down a way to improve  streamline or help that process along in a fashion that offers some utility to both the public and to private interests architects builders green building council folks anyone! you may have found a jumoing off point for branching into your broader idea.

If using your funds then write a check to the organization and spend it out of the organizations account checks or debit preferred to have records.Charitable donations count as part of itemized taxes. If you dont have enougj itemized deductions donations medical bills mortgage interest etc to be more than the standard deduction then it might not end up actually being a tax write off.As soon as you build the board of directors get into a habit of having someone write off receipts when you are donating to the org or when the org is reinbursing you.Do a lot of research before the first employee because now you will be responsible for tax withholdings quarterly reporting is ws ws etc. A program like quickbooks payroll could be a worthwhile investment at that point.Lastly remember that it isnt your nonprofit. The moment you decide to go nonprofit corp as oppose to an llc it becomes the publics nonprofit. You and the board are just the caretakers of it.
