78152,0,t3_1uzbvy,Yeah as Mark said I think its easier if you have all the gadgets completed and lots of friends on your list it really helps to be able to trade in things to collect the relics you need faster. If your after diamonds it may take a while and you may have to do a bit of a grind with opening chests and exiting the game before you accept anything if you dont get what you want but unfortunately you cant give diamonds to friends. ,knack,cenbr97,1,t5_2wf2c
