494197,0,t3_1zs4ph,I mainly buy Vidalia onions because I like the taste of them over the generic bulbyellow onions but this is something that will help you out immensely if you cannot stand the tears from cutting into onions.  Directly from the articlegt. Low sulfur soils that keep the bulbs from developing a pungent taste. Regular onions derive their hot taste from sulfurcontaining compounds. Its these compounds that eventually make you cry when you cut themgtWhen sliced the cells release enzymes that break down the sulfur compounds and generate sulfenic acids unstable chemicals that turn into a volatile gas called sulfuric acid that wafts through the air to your eyes. Thats why Vidalias cause fewer tears!Edit Also when sweating onions off throw in a pinch or two of salt the osmotic pressure makes the water sweat out faster.,foodhacks,cfwg001,1,t5_2u5q1

1403138,0,t1_chb47y6,You dont understand alcohol production homebrewing has  chance of creating methanol.  All yeast fermentation creates methanol and several other poisonous compounds as a byproduct of simple sugar conversion.  Its just that in a low alcohol brew such as beer and wine the concentration is not enough to cause problems.  Its only when it is distilled concentrated that they can rise to problem levels.  But you are correct that distillers who understand the process and care about their product can easily remove these compounds because theyre all volatile and have low boiling points.  Thus they boil and convert to a gas before ethanol and can be removed from the final distillate.  Some distilled alcohols do not usually remove the poisons shochu soju awamori but they are only distilled to  ABV  proof and bottled immediately for sale unlike western style spirits which are distilled to  ABV  proof and then cut with water to dilute them to their bottling strength.  This is why soju et al cause really bad hangovers.,foodhacks,cis5wbs,2,t5_2u5q1

5106255,0,t1_cv1d40u,Quinine in tonic is highly UV reactive as you can see in this video  If you were to mix it with other juices it staying UV reactive would depend on how translucent the other juices are and what the amounts are you are adding. For example a drink with  orange juice which isnt translucent and  tonic would probably be slightly UV reactive still. If its  orange juice and  tonic it probably would barely be UV reactive. However if you used lemon syrup for example because you wanted to create a glow drink that tastes sweeter tonic is very bitter and only  would be lemon syrup and the rest tonic it would be highly UV reactive. Any alcohol thats translucent and coloured but not UV reactive will probably result in a very UV reactive drink combined with tonic. I had a look at the recipe and what I can say about these ingredients goz caster sugar  if white its UV reactive and wont disturb the UV reactiveness of tonic make sure you dont use brown sugarmlfl oz good quality gin  if white same thingmlfl oz tonic  its a good amount mlfl oz apple juice  I would recommend to use less apple juice or make sure you get the most translucent apple juice out there because now its the same amount as the tonic which will make the recipe less UV reactive if not kill the UV reactiveness especially combined with the next ingredient goz butter  butter interferes with the blue UV reactive colour of tonic a tiny bit should be okay though.So for this recipe to work out best Id try to use more tonic andor use translucent apple juice and less of it than the amount of tonic you are using and a bit less butter probably. Its just a guess based on my experience though youd have to experiment! edit spelling,foodhacks,cv1htbc,1,t5_2u5q1

Cover a small bowl with cling wrapglad wrap enough to envelope an egg put either some spray oil or a drop of oil in it so the egg dont stick to it while cooking. Salt andor pepper dont hurt either. . Break egg into cling wrap twist the air out then wrap with something. I use either a wire plastic tie or even a peg.. Place wrapped egg gently into below boiling water use your judgement. Too hot  bad too low  not cooking properly.. The rule of thumb i read is  minutes for full runny yoke  minutes for partial runny and  minutes for hard boiled.

Honestly fish tastes the best when its as fresh as possible and cooked very simply. Always tastes better when you catch it yourself.
