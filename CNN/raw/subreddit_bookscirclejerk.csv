6956840,0,t1_d14sjzb,oh my god.gtexpanding in five hundred pages an idea that could be perfectly explained in a few minutes. A better procedure is to pretend that those books already exist and to offer a summary a commentary. i really loved that book where everyone said i was really really cool and then emma stone kept kissing me i feel it really stimulated a part of me,bookscirclejerk,d14w40f,2,t5_2sioj
7660329,0,t3_4jt8bh,My favorite part of Arbies is their nonbookrelated content. Whos starring in what shitty remake of someones shitty book which authors talked smack about others and of course everyones favorite OMG how great is reading which while strictly speaking is book related seems to be more circlejerkulatory at this point.,bookscirclejerk,d3cxpam,2,t5_2sioj

8728241,0,t3_4zjocm,There was one time where I thought I read The Counselor of Monticello by Albert Dumbass. Then I threw up on myself wept and then farted which made me realize that I didnt read it because people who have read it dont do those things!So I read like the first paragraph and the summary by a redditor never read Dickhickers though so take that for what its worth reading the rest would just be a waste. Either way AMAZING BOOK!,bookscirclejerk,d6wo95k,5,t5_2sioj

11639599,0,t1_dgfc8v3,Its coercive and borderline abusive to suggest somebody should read something they dont wanna. I and I alone am the best person to decide what the best books ever written are before I decide to read them and how dare somebody suggest otherwise.
