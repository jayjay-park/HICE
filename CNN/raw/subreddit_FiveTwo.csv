7672586,0,t3_4j1n58,Glad to see your post. I have done two months of  day water fasts and they just SUCK! But I am  and . My memory is having some major issues I have migraines and my body fat is around . I ride a mt bike a few days a week pretty hard and I try to run my dog a day a week but my office job is in a seat  hours a day so I JUST bought a Varidesk  standing desk to help with that. Since the three day fast was so hard to do for my wife and I shes a stage c breast cancer survivor so she sees the importance of doing this we just watched a documentary from BBC from a guy who searched for the best fasting diet and to see what the benefits were. It seemed like the  was the best. So reading your post here has also encouraged me so my wife and I are just done with  hours of water fasting and are now going to switch over to the . I hope to have similar results and also report back on my memory issues migraines and weight loss as well.,FiveTwo,d3ebtqa,1,t5_2xmzf

11636487,0,t1_dgew33m,Obviously I was exaggerating.  But I still believe that  is the best method to maintain weight without having to omit all of the unhealthy foods.I think this is beacause we where taught that fat  unhealthy. But thats only half the truth. My Grandmom flavours almost everything with a good amount of butter. And by good amount I mean a lot of butter. If you put her foods in the fridge you will be able to scratch of the masses of fat. Still she is almost a hundred years old and except for her osteoporosis pretty healthy and active.What I am trying to say I also used to feel unhealthy when I ate fatty stuff. As I turned vegan that stopped. There are a lot of fatty foods which are exceptionably healthy. Avocado fish or very good olive oil for example. Still I would not want to restrict myself to those foods. I noticed this when I tried keto and found that carrots are not allowed in keto. I was like WTF? and stopped this immediately. My ketogenic diet lastet almost an entire day. D,FiveTwo,dgf0bkb,2,t5_2xmzf
