1097298,0,t3_26o8w8,Good for you!  Im a sucker for sugary desserts as well and Ive found that fruit smoothies help me with cravings.  I try to have a big one most mornings with some leafy greens thrown it.  In the evenings a smaller almond milk and cherry or strawberry smoothie is an amazing dessert and if you blend some chia seeds with it and put in in the fridge for an hourmagic pudding!  Fruit doesnt trigger me to binge like foods with added sugar do.  Good luck!,nobingeing,cht0mnh,2,t5_31wc7
