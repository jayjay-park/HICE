4494794,0,t1_csx24m1, hours sounds good especially considering the different time zones of the clan. But the first attack MUST be the own number so if someone waits  hours to use their first attack they arent left with a lot of time for the second one so we generally would want people to attack as soon as possible.Happy Cake Day!,NeutralClan,csx86db,1,t5_31bem

5932545,0,t3_3wfci3,Sorry I havent replied to this yet mate  it sounds pretty good to me.Probably better to use a giant as a lure rather than archers as they walk further in and tank more damage before dying also would recommend dropping groups of giants rather than spreading them around the entire base  their strength lies in numbers rather than just survivability. A swarm of giants can take out any defence quickly much better than each attacking a separate one. Splash damage generally isnt that much compared to the massive health giants have so as long as your gobs arent getting targeted shouldnt be an issue.Best way to find out is to just give it a burl make sure you post a few replays afterwards for us!,NeutralClan,cxxacgc,1,t5_31bem
