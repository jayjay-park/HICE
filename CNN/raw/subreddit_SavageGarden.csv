435165,0,t3_1z0vzp,I assume you are talking about the dunecraft kits.I have had two and have been pretty successful with both.  They are legit however they are the antithesis of instant or even moderate gratification. The instructions are easy to misread and youre looking at three weeks minimum before you are even ready to plant. Once planted youre looking at somewhere around  months before you have the tiniest sprouts.  My sarcenias are  years old and the largest pitchers are about  inches tall and about the diameter of a pencil. My single flytrap that grew from the last kit is showing color but is barely larger than a quarter.They arent exactly a waste of money but growing carnivorous plants from seed takes a really long time.  Years to yield decent results and the germination rates for seeds varies wildly from a veritable carni forest to an abysmal desert devoid of all but one or two sprouts.Drossera tend to be really easy to grow from seed.  In my experience drossera are easy and tend to grow quickly sarrascenia is next followed by dionea. I tried growing some darlingtonia from seed but had zero germination.  I have not tried nepenthes or some of the more esoteric cultivars. Getting Lowes plants can be a craps shoot.  I have had both good and bad luck with plants from the hardware store. If you want to grow from seed get savage garden and indoor horticulturethis is a generic indoor gardening book which is an excellent resource.  Prepare yourself for disappointment but at the same time you will probably be kind of successful if you remain patient. I have used the seeds from the dunecraft kits and seeds purchased from eBay.  YMMV when it comes to seed stock.  Growing from seed is rewarding like growing a bonsai is rewarding.If you just want some good plants still get the books but get them from a reputable dealer like California carnivores or courting frogs. I am sure others can vouch for the good guys. I would generally avoid eBay unless you can vet the source of the plants.  There has been an alarming trend where natural habitats are being poached and sold. Ill post some pictures once I get back from my business trip. TLDR  the dunecraft kit is legit but takes years to yield results and the instructions arent exactly written very well,SavageGarden,cfpvbmo,1,t5_2qwxx

4967172,0,t1_cuke6hz,From my personal experience  I gained it through trial with the lights available at several different hardware stores etc my indoor plants expensive nepenthes n attenboroughii for example as well as my sundew tray are now not just hanging in there but thriving. My local independent hardware store fresno Ag in fresno ca. Carries all sorts of indoor grow lights by a wide variety of dealers. The sun blaster t lights have blown every other light Ive bought right out of the water. The first one  the smallest of their lights made me understand what pathetic lights Id been using. I added two two three footers this week that go all the way across the underside if the wire shelves by the ratchet pulley systems have been a miracle for my plants. As a grower once told me if your plants arent thriving they are dying. I believe thats true and we should see growth and health at the optimal growth cycles of our plants. If thats now being seen then adjust the lighting. The lights are as cheap if not cheaper than a standard Walmart gro lite and cant be beat for the cost of adding reflectors to for less than ten each. Right now Im locating more to bump the rest of my lighting affordable. Mistakes here can really be money burned forever and plants that really struggle. Find a supplier and try one. Youll see exactly what I mean for your indoor plants. They really cant be beat with anything else Ive come across. Edit sun blaster may likely sell just the build replacements. It never hurts to email their company and find out. They do sell a light system that holds two upwards bulbs so I see no reason why that wouldnt be possible.

5758595,0,t1_cxauu18,Good question. The step by step photos are hereIts in the first few photos. I believe the rock planter its large enough to fill the  or so clay saucer is some type of Tufa rock. It was soaked and resoaked in fresh water for a few weeks to make sure it was as clean as possible. The planter was purchased it at a yard sale for like  last summer and it was pretty grimy with garden clay loam soil. It does hold water in the recesses so after running a few unscientific tests with wet long fiber sphagnum NZ moss I decided to layer lightly damp LFS onto the surface and mixed a batch of silica sand peat pumice a sprinkle of dolomitic lime fine orchid bark etc. layered the damp mix over the LFS and began at the edges. Some of the Pinguiculas were easier than others as I mainly used bent forcep tweezers to take the clump of media from under the Pings to conserve any roots. I was kind of dreading the process as I performed the whole operation on my kitchen floor but it turned out okay. The pings were a little dirt caked and a few did suffer leaf breakage but you know what they say you cant make an omelette without bruising or breaking Pinguicula paddles!

Neps are a lot like orchids in that they need very airy soil for their roots to breathe. If theres a pet shop nearby you can grab a bag of coarse aquarium gravel rinse well before use that works pretty well.
