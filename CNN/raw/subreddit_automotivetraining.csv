502446,0,t3_1vi3mz,Any updates OP on if youve decided to pursue this? Im  and thinking about the same thing. I work in IT right now and I hate being in a cube hunched over a computer all day dealing with micromanagement BS. Im thinking of trying for the Cat Think Big program to become a diesel tech.,automotivetraining,cfxdqv4,1,t5_2u78d
1423616,0,t1_ciuppv9,Ah disregard what I said.  My RX did that in st and nd when I wasnt giving much throttle... I think it has to do with short gearing basically you just need to shift at a higher RPM in the gears that its happening in.,automotivetraining,ciuq7mi,1,t5_2u78d
2308704,0,t3_2lp0hf,If you have access to AllData there is a process for resetting the security system on there. Its pretty lengthy so I dont remember how to do it off the top of my head. You dont need any special tools for it. The first step though is to check and see if it us working properly in the first place. With the key off there should be a light on the dash that blinks about every  seconds. If it is not then the system is effed and youre gonna have to replace it. Dealership part....kinda expensive. If it is working the transceiver may have forgotten your key...strange I know but it happens. The dealership can reteach it your key though or replace it if its bad. Sorry for the wall of text.TlDr Make sure the security system is operating properly then check the key transceiver on the ignition switch,automotivetraining,clx2lvz,1,t5_2u78d

3947357,0,t3_35noiq,You should not have a problem finding any employment.  Having the AAS helps on the resume and interview but it has no huge effect on salary or position.. Professional experience effects that but Im sure you know that.  Expect to be hired somewhere doing oil changes rotations basic maintenance stuff for awhile.  Try applying at high volume shops.. dealers are nice.. they can get you extra training exclusive to the make they sell and if the service manager sees that degree he may want to move you up faster and get you dealer training quicker depends on service manager.  Independent shops are nice too because you will see a larger variety of makes models and years come in.  In either case get real friendly with a master tech and assist as much as possible if you have any down time.  Im graduating for my auto tech degree this winter and have worked at a dealer and currently at an independent shop.,automotivetraining,cr68edu,6,t5_2u78d

5136474,0,t1_cuzrz33,I agree with DrunkleDick. The sooner you start doing maintenance repairs on your vehicle the more of an understanding youll have on how it works. I would also look into basics like how an engine works how a transmission works find out what type of engine and transmission your car has and so on. If you have the time taking a auto shop course is very beneficial and give you a great understanding of car anatomy. ,automotivetraining,cv54xl3,1,t5_2u78d
6128990,0,t1_cyma43n,Funny you say that. My uncle said that UTI would be a waste of time and money. Grandfather told me not to get into Collision repair. I plan to do auto service and attend a Strauders tuning school or whatever the name of it was.,automotivetraining,cymawhg,1,t5_2u78d
