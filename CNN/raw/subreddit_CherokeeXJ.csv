1865795,0,t1_cke09zq,Deck that block to make sure everything is kosher before putting a head on it. Be very careful grinding a head by yourself. Stay away from the surfaces where the valves actually seal against the head. Just hogging out the passageways with a die grinder will smooth out the airflow a bit but putting it on a real flow bench is whats going to tell you whether your work paid off or not. If the previous owner blew a head gasket and possibly a head there could have been some bigtime heat involved. Check the connecting rods and crank bearings carefully because thats where lubrication can be sacrificed during an event of extreme heat. Ive never heard of people using a TJ coil pack on their XJ with an  head but I guess it could be done. Itll really depend if the wiring connector that plugs into the end of the factory coil rail is the same or if youll have to repin a connector from a junkyard TJ. The coil pack itself is like two hundred bucks. It just seems that a few bucks for straps of stainless steel and some nuts and bolts is a bit cheaper. making tabs like this  and utilizing the stock coil rail is significantly cheaper but the coil rail does make it harder to diagnose a misfire if its not showing up as a check engine light because youve gotta pull the whole shebang not individual plug wires looking for a change.I have seen a Dodge Viper coil used in an either  or  XJ. The Viper is a V but it has a  plug coil and a  plug coil. You just buy the  plug coil and repin it to work. Heres a picture of one mounted. ,CherokeeXJ,cke0tru,1,t5_2unpm

3110405,0,t3_2vol58,I moved my horns up into the engine bay because mine were getting filled with water during water crossings. When the factory horns are filled with water they are very quiet. When I need to use my horn its usually for good reason. The first time I realized they werent working I almost hit someone on the highway. Its good to have a horn that works!The big black trumpet type thing is my PA speaker. Its nice to be able to tell people things when doing a recovery without shouting or getting out of the vehicle. The red thing in the right of the picture is an aftermarket horn that I have mounted up nice and high. Here is another picture of the red horn. I took this picture to show my CB mount but you can see my horn too.  I havent managed to fill that one with water yet. Having the horns in the engine bay works just fine.

4356814,0,t3_3av4hq,The grinding could be a binding of your driveline. Check both motor mounts and your transmission crossmember mount as well. If the enginetransmission is moving around in your engine bay the movement can lead to unfavorable driveline angles which can cause binding. If the vehicle is down on power when it comes to acceleration youve probably got a clutch thats about to give up. If the sound changes with RPM you may have a bad throwout bearing. If thats the case youre pulling the engine or transmission to get to it. If youre going to go through all the labor to get to it you might as well put a clutch in it and resurface the flywheel while youve got the whole vehicle apart. You dont want to do that kind of labor twice. Does the sound stop if you press on the clutch a little bit or dont let the pedal go all the way up as youre accelerating from a stop? I had a pickup that did that once and I was told it was indicative of a bad throwout bearing but Im bad at diagnosing clutch problems. You may have an issue within the transmission. Check the fluid level and make sure its got enough. ,CherokeeXJ,csgqvd1,1,t5_2unpm

5571039,0,t3_3rfjoc,The temp gauge sensor is located on the thermostat housing front of the engine top right. Its an easy fix but at this point given youve got no temp readings and no heat Id flush the radiator pull the thermostat housing and replace the thermostat then replace the sensor. This is a pretty easy and cheap fix.The oil pressure senders are notorious for going wonky. Check the wiring the sender is near the base of the distributor on the left side of the engine. Odds are the wiring is fine and the sender is just dying its also an easy fix disconnect cable unscrew old one screw in new one.Since youve recently tuned up the spark side and likely have no problems on the air side though Id check the throttle body to be sure nothing is sticking youre probably on the right track that its fuel. The fact that its a hard start when warm could be a number of things like vapor lock or an electrical problem that only happens when the car is warm. Id check all the wiring around the coil and also inspect the fuel line routing make sure its not touching the manifold it should be rubber from the fuel rail to a steel line that runs over to the firewall and then down under. Vapor lock is unusal but not unheard of you can also use foil insulation to insulate the rail and line if thats the problem. Is the hard starting worse when its hot out? Also if the check valve of the fuel pump goes bad it will release pressure from the fuel rail and make vapor lock more likely normally the high pressure prevents it. Id probably try to get the pressure tested and watch it with the engine off to see if thats a factor.,CherokeeXJ,cwnn07a,2,t5_2unpm

5657293,0,t3_3sfrwb,Ok little wobble. In order of likelyhood. Check your tire pressure all around. Make sure they are all where they should be. Even lbs off can cause it. . Swap your front tires to the back and see if things improve. If they do get them all balanced.. Get under it and have someone turn the wheel side to side just enough to move a tire a hair. Look for anything that isnt moving or lagging behind other components. If you spot anything replace it. . Have someone pushjump on the fenders. Check sway bar bushings and link bushings. . Check alignment. Can do it with a measuring tape. look for gojeeps site he has a diy alignment procedure.  .

5839942,0,t1_cxkxo7d,You cover the spliced area with tape. I said it above and so does the diagram. Of course you should never leave bare wires just hanging out exposed. As far as being sturdy the diagram also recommends the use of zip ties to tie the new wire against the wire you spliced into. That way it wont pull out. Properly done electrical work wouldnt have any wires between the pedals anyway.The reason a lot of people dont use taps is because they can create impedance by partially severing the wire. If some of the strands are broken by the quick splice tap thing youre going to get a voltage drop at the other end. Ive had them work for me in the past wiring a flat  trailer connector to a Subarus tail light harness but I havent used them for anything more than that one project. I tried them because I was in a hurry and they were in the kit. I can see their benefit by being quick but I debate whether they give the user a better connection than actually having copper wire on copper wire wrapped together. Ive never seen a professional use those wire taps. Ive never seen an automaker use them either. There must be a reason for that. I use plenty of crimpon connectors like butt connectors spades and ring terminals but I prefer to splice in a fashion that wont compromise the wire being tapped into. Use whatever you like but those tap things arent my bag. ,CherokeeXJ,cxl564p,1,t5_2unpm

I did have multiple fitment issues with the kit what do you expect for a cheap lift kit. Had to grind down the front brake lines to clear the caliper housing. Also had to drill out the center of the spring plates to fit. ,CherokeeXJ,d66oaq5,1,t5_2unpm

Heres a picture I found just doing a google image search A compression test and leakdown test certainly wouldnt hurt. Also keep track of how much coolant your system may be consuming and regularly check the underside of your oil cap for signs of gross stuff like this I personally wouldnt even start turning wrenches until I was  sure there was a head issue. Theres no reason to do that kind of work and spend that much time on it unless you really have to. That kind of work is not my idea of fun.

When you rebuilt the axles and transfer case did you keep the stock ratios and did you have the full time or part time transfer case?When I put in my lockers i regeared my axles including a sourced Chrysler . rear axle to . ratio up from .. Because I was only running  inch tires the engine was turning faster and things like the water pump cooling fan and alternator were also turning faster at similar speed. It was the best mod I did for the Jeep. My trans would overheat because of the extra strain of s when going uphill my engine would overheat on really hot days in over drive and the AC was crap also. But once I put in the new gears all those problems went away. Renix isnt great but it can be made to work well.

The flexplate bolts back out and loosen from the torque converter which is not good. If you have weird noises rough idle roughslipping shifting then go check asap.Its easy to do on a stock height xj. I put a thread up the other day about it you can also google and find lots of good info.

The key should turn a full  degrees.Have you tried holding the key in the unlock position and pressing the button?

Youll lose some turning radius but its the cheapest solution and Id start there before I added wheel spacers or spent the  on new rims. You can swap in WJ lower control arms with a little work. Theyve got a bend in them that will give you more room for the insides of the tires when youre at full lock. WJ lower control arms on Cherokee XJ Rustys makes a set that are direct boltin if youre not so inclined to do all the work that the WJ arms require.
