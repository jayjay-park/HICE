702162,0,t1_cgk0s1q,gtThanks for the reply! Yeah Ive been searching through posts to try and average all the responses out. Other than downtown what are you favorite areas? Least favorite areas? Its hard to say favourite areas at least in town. Its just a city imho so I have favourite restaurants and stores but no favourite areas per se. I mean I love the little neighbourhood I live in but I wouldnt recommend it for sightseeing POutside of town... coming from the Vegas desert Im fascinated by pretty much any rural areas I see. Its just such a change from the landscape in Vegas and Colorado Im imagining. It almost feels like going back in time to a simpler time its just so refreshing. Nearby there are some very picturesque places with picturesque drives to get there like Caesars Head or Lake Lure in NC. And you also have nearby cities like others speak of like Atlanta Charleston and Asheville. In town least favourite? Well I tend to stay away from the poorer areas but thats mainly just because I dont have a reason to be there its not a conscious aversion. Hell I had some rough years here I lived those places. Still better than the poor areas of Vegas.gtI grew up in Colorado Springs which has tons of churches and while I dont subscribe Im used to it.Yeah one group of people youll see here are those that are so horribly offended by the churches and church people. Look there ARE some preachy churchians but MOST of them are not TOO pushy and can be deflected fairly easily. Thats what I was saying earlier that the churchy aspect of the area isnt horrible unless you let it be dwell on it and harbor resentment or something.gtI really enjoy the southern mentality and Im looking forward to it. If you have any information on teacher salaries I would really appreciate it. My girlfriend will have her masters in english amp reading by the time were ready to move.Ill see what information I can find motherinlaw was a teacher until retirement her sister is a teacher and my sisterinlaw works for the school district. I should be able to find something out gtThanks again for your insight. No problem! My wife says what I did  its not perfect nowhere is but its a great place to live.

1805214,0,t1_ck6cyzr,Your definition of a township sounds closer to the way it is in Pennsylvania and if youll notice on the Wikipedia page for Greenville County it has Piedmont listed under unincorporated communities. I know a few years ago when the CharlestonJames Island dispute was going on the town changed the signs to Public Service District instead of Town Limit because in the interim thats essentially what it was just like Taylors. So maybe Piedmont meant to or should have put up a sign that said Public Service District but it somehow got delivered as Town Limit and they went ahead and put it up anyway?,greenville,ck6oxvp,1,t5_2rnx6

1972096,0,t1_ckqpuzf,You present the drug problems were experiencing as though they are an entirely userdependent system of abuse. This is not a reflection of realitythe people who are selling these drugs are the root of the problem not the purchasers.gtTreat the addiction not the purchase! I dont understand why you insist upon a view which cuts out the supplier that is the malevolent party in this issue. However I wholeheartedly agree with you that users should not be treated so harshly by the law. If this omission was unintentional what do you suggest we do at the state level to curtail harmful drug sales? Your argument as regards education reform leaves something to be desired. gtWhen you determine the minimum acceptable education standards at the federal level you have to legislate at the least common denominator and assume that all children are at a lower level. This requires treating all students as if theyre at a lower level thats why cookiecutter legislation like No ChildCommon Core are dangerous for children in public school.First I would like to make clear that I in no way harbor any hostility toward this viewI just think its not completely honest with itself. What are states to do with this Taoistlike system of no standard as standard? To take this to an absurd extreme do we teach public school material at a university level in order to weed out the intellectual weaklings? The system you seem to be endorsing is one which guarantees suffering at a basic level while promising a utopia for those of us with the resources to flourish easily. In other words pulling oneself up by ones bootstraps is all well and good so long as one has bootstraps to pull. gtI say we abolish it and let airlines protect their property and passengers accordingly. No I would not endorse any government entity in charge of securing air travel at the federal level.People have a reasonable expectation of safe travel in the civilized world and that extends to air safety. What traveler casualties would be involved in your proposed autonomous governance of air safety? What reasonable guarantee of safety do we have when there is no explicit legal governance of such safety measures per your commentI could see your argument from a stategoverned level but you never made that clear. As regards your argument on oil dependency I like where youre going. I would like to know what your favorite alternative energy sources are specifically those which would be significant and useful for South Carolinians.gtAbolish the NSA its as simple as that. . . . I say we do away with it!Is it? What specific steps would you take in order to ensure that our liberties are safeguarded as well as our national security in the absence of a body designed to do exactly thatregardless of that bodys basic failure to do so in recent history?

Im not used to everyone serving mild and barely above mild salsa. I keep having to request salsa fresca caliente and salsa verde to get the legit stuff. I also liked El Matador. Papas and Beer was a disappointment when friends from Houston visited and they picked it. They were pretty miffed at having to put old salsa in a teeny tiny cup a couple dozen times. La Parrilla is a chain and pretty American. We prefer the taco trucks. I wish I knew where to find the local little old lady that sells tamales in a little blue cooler with tomatillo sauce. We had good food at La Unica the local supermercado on White Horse at the cafe in the store. They had really good churros and mangonadas.,greenville,cz8na9w,1,t5_2rnx6

I drove for a month and stopped because it wasnt really worth it to me personally. I think Greenville is a little crowded with drivers and that was part of my rationale. I think you should give it a go if youre interested. However it may do you well to lower your expectations. There is virtually no demand unless you are doing late nights and drunken parties. Even then you may sit idle for a while. ,greenville,d1q8fmb,3,t5_2rnx6

The greater Greenville area has tons of stuff all over the place more than enough that you never need to go more than  minutes to get to most everything you need unless youre going to a very specific place which lets be honest is not a daily routine except work obviously.I have no idea how your average trip is  minutes unless you live out in a super rural area in which case you dont actually live in Greenville.  I honestly have no idea how you could have an average trip time of  minutes you can literally go between the two furthest points of the Greenville Area in  minutes. ,greenville,d1vcke3,3,t5_2rnx6

8600034,0,t1_d6gj97c,I dont think traffic in Greenville is anywhere near bad enough for people to really need a park and ride setup though. I think for most people it would still be cheaper and easier to just drive. Light rail would just sit there with nobody on it.Places that need mass transit in Greenville like Woodruff Rd are not set up at all for walking. I wouldnt want to get off at a stop and then have to walk across a  acre parking lot in the middle of summer. You would probably get run over if you didnt die from the heat. This is why I lean more toward the direction of something like light rail being used as a tool for growth rather than for fixing a problem. Really the problem is unmanaged sprawling growth not the traffic itself. If rail is deployed with growth in mind you have to do so in the context of a broader growth plan with tall buildings and sidewalks not the rich guy who is going to end up buying a huge plot of land in front of a rail stop so he can sit on his front porch look over his  acres and admire the civilization rising up around him. People are just going to end up buying land around where rail stops would be built and would end up squatting on that land rather than develop it. If they do develop it then its going to be single family homes with one acre each completely defeating the purpose of a walkable rail system.,greenville,d6glidw,5,t5_2rnx6

You may have some luck looking into Anderson or Spartanburg.All apartments are going to want proof of income with your income being x rent. You can sometimes give them a tax return showing your income last year and theyll accept that. Your money is no good unless you can show them itll keep coming.Greenville is getting expensive. Cost of living is low but NOT rent. Housing is in steep demand and short supply here. Houses are selling within  hours of being put on the market in many cases. The emphasis to be on keeping it quaint which doesnt allow buildings big enough to get built to satisfy demand. Decent places seem to start at  for a br. I currently pay  for a br.Honestly Atlanta may be a cheaper place to live than Greenville and its a bigger city.One thing you can look into is those long term stay hotels. Those would be a matter of just handing them cash. It may be more expensive though.Seriously the keep it quaint mentality is one of the things I dont like about Greenville. Its going to end up being another San Francisco. We will all be paying k a month for a br but at least the buildings are nice and quaint! In the dowtown area just get over it and have tall buildings!
