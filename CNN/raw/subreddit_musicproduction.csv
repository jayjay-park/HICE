Ive used them in a friends studio great clear sound.And Mackie CrsEven thought this is lower budget still delivers great results albeit perhaps not as good as the Yamahas you still get a clear flat sound of your production and it comes with foam pads and cables. I use it because I work in a very small space and the Yamahas are off my budget limits and a bit overkill for my room. They get the job done but of course I still refer to outer monitors for reference and finetuning. But honestly if my budget allowed Id go for the Yamahas. I know many seasoned pros that use them for their home studio and commercial work.,musicproduction,d0bq4oe,2,t5_2rfyt
6979004,0,t3_4aphwd,Fuckin dirty!I was jamming man. Really enjoyed the song.My only suggestion and it only comes with lots of time and practice Im still working on it myself is to work on the mix a bit more. The kick got a bit lost behind the lead maybe fattening it up playing around with the EQs layering etc will help bring it out some more.  When I use a lead sound like yours I usually try to make the bass really big and punchy usually by using several different kicks that I EQ differently and boost.If you dont mind returning the favor please check out my song and let me know how you would improve it.Thanks ,musicproduction,d17epu8,2,t5_2rfyt

7855712,0,t3_4mtmhm,I laughed a lot this was good. ButThe rapping recording is crap. So much background noise. Better mic or better eq. Something. It doesnt fit.The wah on the guitar is too deep. It doesnt balance.I want the bass stronger and the drums harder. Look into compression. Make sure to cut out the lows on everything but the basskick,musicproduction,d3z1x4s,1,t5_2rfyt

9405566,0,t1_d9773eu,Most of my space rock songs start as an inthebox draft because Im pretty good at programming heavy guitar riffing and halfway realistic drums in the piano roll. But at the moment From Siobhan is the only completely ITB piece that is online.My project voXager has real guitars but programmed bass and drums. The guitars started ITB as well however. A guitarist simply took my programmed guitars and rerecorded them with a real guitar except for guitar solos I did not preprogram them.I also have an allelectronic sideproject its here  Overspace But Im afraid my electronic music is not as good or as catchy as my space rock stuff. ,musicproduction,d987znv,2,t5_2rfyt

11313624,0,t1_dfede1k,I havent seen any producers who use FL Studio on Mac before. Metro Boomin and Mike WILL Made It uses Razer Blade and MSI laptops. Not sure how FL is gonna do on Mac. But you can try!,musicproduction,dfedqop,2,t5_2rfyt
11372431,0,t1_dfkniwp,See originally I avoided labels and never wanted to jump the gun but I feel like a labels importance is a growing factor. I probably shouldnt rush into it though for sure. I just think being on a label gets you all of that for free and people are more inclined to listen to your tunes if youre signed. ,musicproduction,dfl1l8b,1,t5_2rfyt
