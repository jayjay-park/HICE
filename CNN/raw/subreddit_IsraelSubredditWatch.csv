3340261,0,t1_cp90fxu,Actually its important to shoot the messenger if theyre lying especially when it comes to this sort of thing.All the proIsrael Jews I know are very quick to get nasty about Pakistanis or other nonArab greater regional ethnicities.All the Pakistanis I know dont give two shits about Jews either way.But youre a dumb fuck and a troll as it is so what do you care about anything outside of your pathetic victimnarrative?,IsraelSubredditWatch,cp90iy7,2,t5_2viu9
3342001,0,t1_cp97ars,Zach your comments are hypocritical judging by your replies on the same question i asked on the  rPalestinesubwatch ,IsraelSubredditWatch,cp97o8u,5,t5_2viu9
3360481,0,t1_cpb6jsq,gt  The Palestinian population did grow but that tends to happen when people have children.And when  of them come into Palestine in  years which is what Robert Kennedy reported and you never proved otherwise.gt Youre projecting the nonsense that you believe onto me its hilarious.If you believe all the Palestinian Arabs had been there for hundreds of years prove it. I dont deny some of the Palestinian Jews arrived there relatively recently. Can you say the same about Palestinian Arabs? gt The people who became the Palestinian Arabs were always thereBlatant blatant falsehood. Kennedy proved you wrong. gt More of the same nonsense. I actually dont mind insulting some idiotic character whos from New York by way of Europe for the past thousand years before his family moved to North America.Do you mind insulting the Indian nation by arguing that their British occupiers were indigenous? Because thats exactly what youre doing. gt It is indisputable that those who advocated and pushed for Zionism were in the overwhelming majority not indigenous to Palestine or the Levant.Conquerers like you always try to divide and conquer. The Jewish people are indigenous to the Levant whether some of them believe in Zionism or not. I invite you to deal with it.gt It is likewise indisputable that those Palestinian Arabs living in Palestine were and are indigenous to Palestine and the Levant.Stamp stamp stamp! Kennedy proves you wrong. ,IsraelSubredditWatch,cpbbil1,0,t5_2viu9
3380488,0,t1_cpdlgg9,gt We already know that the people pouring into the country in that period were JewsRobert Kennedy reported Arabs were pouring into the country as well. You never proved him wrong. gt  who had no right to be thereSo Jews have no right to be in Palestine but Arabs do? Does that mean you dont think Jews are equal to Arabs? Dont bother answering we both know you dont. gt  Palestinian Arabs were and are indigenous to Palestine.Arabs invaded and stole Palestine in the th century. You cant be indigenous to a place you never lived until you invaded it. Unless apparently youre Arab. gt Im the only one whos been saying anything that has anything to do with the truth.Youre the only one lying. If you want to say the truth prove Kennedy wrong. So far you havent. Because you cant. ,IsraelSubredditWatch,cpdlmqy,-3,t5_2viu9
3570315,0,t3_3182ly,A good example of the sort of toxic mentality that the Israeli state and proIsrael diaspora sentiment foster and laud as beneficial.,IsraelSubredditWatch,cpz8rz6,3,t5_2viu9
3680673,0,t3_32hch6,Ok so the articles highlighted. Of the seven First deals with the occupation. Second deals with settlements and their harm to Palestinians. Third deals with BDS and the occupation. Fourth I cant say if the article does deal with Palestine but the headline does not. Fifth deals with Israels security which is obviously something that involves Palestine. Sixth deals with Palestinian refugees. Seventh and last deals with attitudes changing between Israel and Palestine.So out of  highlighted submissions only one directly might have nothing to do with Palestine. ,IsraelSubredditWatch,cqbtk12,2,t5_2viu9
3689767,0,t1_cqcui5a,gtIts a piece of shit third world country stereotype. But not western word standard is it? I dont remember America or the UK Canada Australia occupying Iraq or Afghanistan and allowing them to make stamped in Made in AmericaCanada Garments. And then saying You better thanks us for this! you would of have nothing better. This is some old school colonial bullshit.gtThere is child labor in other exceptional countries like North Korea Ethiopia and SudanYou just compared Israel to North Korea Ethiopia and Sudan.
