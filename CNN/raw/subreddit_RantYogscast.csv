4573821,0,t1_ct6mifl,Id say the Yogscast Complete Pack series were actually the closest to recapturing the essence of the old Tekkit days but the magic was lost somewhere in the attempt. Maybe its the fact that there were so many people on the server there was little connection between series and fans had to make their own masterposts of series hosted on the server just to keep track of them all because there werent any similar lists in an official capacity. But Im not really sure.Cornerstone was a letdown in all honesty. They had the chance to do something fresh promote smaller channels in a group setting where chemistry between new faces would be encouraged to develop. Instead we ended up with Hat Films and Flux Buddies as standard the comeback of the old Rail Bros outfit and the occasional guest who was either another wellknown Yogscast member or a personal friend of Sjins who wasnt even in the Yogscast.,RantYogscast,ct750vj,2,t5_395jy

I dont know his whole situation but I am assuming he is divorcesplit up from the mother of his other children who I also assume has custody of them.  Is he now never allowed to leave their vicinity have a relationship with another woman and have more children?Seems like an unfair standard to me.  I say this being raised by an only mother I dont think my father should be limited from pursing his life just because things didnt work out between him and my mother after I was born.,RantYogscast,ctm97xh,12,t5_395jy
4762844,0,t1_ctuw410,Thats an excellent point and something I didnt even consider.The whole point of promoting something is hey look at this cool thing! youll really enjoy it! bring your friends! its going to be awesome! so I personally have no issues with them speaking about it.Even if theyre not particularly keen to see the film I dont think Id mind as long as it wasnt Helloo..Yogggcasttt obvious. Michelle Monaghans video was the same idea but executed to the point it wasnt as if Satan himself was holding her at gun point to make a video for The Yogscast.,RantYogscast,ctuwg8h,3,t5_395jy
4778680,0,t3_3g3lxq,Incredible amount of presumption from everyone on this!! Its probably worth adding to this that next to none of us knew about this deal if you didnt guess from social media response so it was so early on in the making when it was cancelled that it never even got to the content creators. When it says planning the likelihood is that refers to a pitch that would have been made to see if there was interest in our take on it versus a sealed deal already agreed on  hence the backing out when they said they wanted full control. That could have been a conversation months before the trailers showed up or at least the fuller ones from the last few months which revealed the true glory of how bad it was. Ill admit the teasers made me think it could potentially have been a funny yet cheesy film which was worth a giggle  but when they did more coverage and reviews my viewpoint changed so I wouldnt have backed it if Id been offered.In terms of querying things we dont genuinely recommend  I try to always make sure my deals are for things I have an interest in or think people will want to see. Thats why I stubbornly stick with Assassins Creed its a fan favourite of mine. You dont always get it right but youre human and not perfect  and I think people forget that before they point the finger.EDIT Just chatted with Turps  we never approved the ad or knew it was happening. Theyre using our name to gain attention and have paid to put them on our videos  without our permission  and it may be out of our control to get them taken off.,RantYogscast,ctww6t6,22,t5_395jy
