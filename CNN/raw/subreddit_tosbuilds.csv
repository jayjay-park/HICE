5620335,0,t3_3rbqu5, Cleric  gt Priest  gt Paladin  here.  Almost C grind is forever...Ive done a lot of testing between the stats.  Here are my findingsI ran a  STR   SPI   DEX build up to about the time I hit C Paladin.  Spirit isnt as good as everyone thinks and the main reason for this is that you dont regen while performing any actions.  This is a huge negative for offensivestyle Paladins as were either autoattacking buffing or healing most of the time.If you just leave Spirit as an investment to increase your SP pool its a pretty terrible waste of points.  About the only use case that seemed to work with Spirit is when I played a more pure support role for party play in dungeons  meaning I neglected autoattacks for the most part and stuck to healing buffing and smiting every  now and then.Basically if you go a Paladin variant that isnt as reliant on autoattacking as a Priest one is then Spirit might be more useful.  Otherwise Ive been fine using SP pots and my base SP pool.It is my opinion that everyone is wrong in this thread about STR.  My current build is  CON   DEX  rest into STR.  You really only want to use Smite on mobs that are weak to it and in that scenario  point of STR   damage.  That is further multiplied by any levels in the Smite attribute.  Dont forget that you get  more STR every rank too.The result is I have something over  STR right now.  Thats  extra on smite weak mobs plus an extra  because I have  from attributes.  My STR investment increases each of my smite hits by  give or take to defense obviously which is often the difference between oneshotting or not.  You want your smites to be oneshotting at my level.I tried every other combination of stats all dex mix dexstr etc and putting most of your points into STR is the best way to get consistent oneshot smites.  Im starting to overkill mobs at my level too which I imagine will increase once I hit C.  Being able to overkill at all is a pretty big deal.This is on top of STR actually being decent for classes that are stuck using onehanders especially if they are reliant on autoattacking.  Most of the STR conversation has been centered in the Swordsman  Highlander  Barbarian OP discussion where they have access to handers which have plentiful ATK values on top of having strong DPS abilities that diminish the need for reliance on autoattacking.  That and the truth is that most players are too low rank to feel the full impact of the STR multipliers yet.The reality for Paladins is that STR has too many multipliers when considering Smite and thats only going to get crazier the higher we get.  Im calling it right now  STR Pallies will be one of the few classes that can consistently get max or near max overkills due to Smite.,tosbuilds,cwtr8nj,1,t5_3afng
6751533,0,t1_d0hn1g3,For catar stroke it seems that  points are enough. More points mean longer charging just for you to get interrupted and lose the cooldownoverheat charge   Its still so strong at just  points.  I brought up barb because I remember a guy I partied up with doing swordpeltxbarbFencer during icbt and he seemed to like it.   Regardless youre going to be tanky and be able to some damage on the side whether you pick highlander or barb. I think Barb skills are more bursty and selfish while highlander skills have sustained damage through the  cdless skills and some armor shredding at C. Overall I think its whatever you want your character to be. Ive yet to try either going to C for myself because I was too busy suffering as a cataphract main in closed beta days thank God for the buffs and numerous quality of life changes. ,tosbuilds,d0hnz9l,2,t5_3afng
7168136,0,t1_d1swe5z,I would probably go more STR.  Its kinda hard to judge the exact best ratio but I think STR because of rank scaling is a bit better.  I have been going close  but I think I might eventually head to a  or something near it.  It might be less dps but it is more balanced and wont be hit hard if they change stats again like the did with dex last time.,tosbuilds,d1sy6s7,1,t5_3afng

7514394,0,t3_4fgik3,PVP focused and INT cleric do not go together. If you want to go PvP you have to invest a lot into CON. INT cleric is only for PvE. All your builds are similar and it would only depend on what skills you are going after.,tosbuilds,d2wckyd,1,t5_3afng
7561653,0,t3_4iwdd3,Id say go with either the one you have atm or the first option. Wugushi poison ticks dont crit too so its best you go strelemental property attacks for it.Swift Step critical is pretty good on its own specially since rangers steady aim has been nerfed. If you dont want to use it though sapper is very good by itself and works very well with a dex build broom trap crits. QSSapper gives you awesome ground control with pavise caltrops traps etc. Fun too. You could also take both. For rank  falconer is taken mostly for giving circling to your party. But you will already have sapper to contribute nicely towards AoE damage and a linker can do the same job even better Id say. Archer with Kneeling shot and Swift step would give you crit chance more aspd evasion damage and move speed. All those are highly used things with Sappers traps or QS skills. Up to you.,tosbuilds,d31q23n,2,t5_3afng
7589758,0,t3_4j8ywj,Thauma here.  Wouldnt bother unless you were going at least thauma.  Swell right arm and reversi are both amazing.  Chrono gives you quicken haste slow and pass.  Level  slow is  speed.  Base move speed for a player character is .  Id be terrified of a chrono in PvP.  At this point you have no reason to not go cryo.  Cryo only multiplies your supportive capacity with snow rolling and frost pillar.  For a buffing supporter Id suggest going cryogtthaumagtr of choice to round out your character.  Cryogtkino is also a solid disabler supporter.  ,tosbuilds,d34x2e0,2,t5_3afng
7591150,0,t3_4j9aq4,What does isnt very squish focused on pvp and duels mean?gt For my build i did some research and i think that the best option is Cleric c gt Priest c gt monk c Is this reaaly the best option ?Nope. Monk is not even close to top dps. If you want v damage you will want to look in the archer or wizard tree. Int clerics like cleric  diev  druid  possibly add krivis  for more power will have much better dps than str clerics but only in pve where enemies just walkstand on your magic circles. It will not nearly be as effective in pvp. If youre looking for something that is both durable and offensive in pvppve I would look into being a full con pyrocryo link thaum sorc warlock. Check that out and see if it suits your fancygt For my stat distribution i am reaaly confused some say to go full dex some say to go full con and others to go  dex  con and the rest in str. What would be an optmal stat distribution focusing pvp ?Stats are hard to juggle because they all have their merits. Imo for pvp con gt dex gt str. For every point of con you get  more hp while every point of str will let you do  to  more damage depending on your rank. The numbers speak for themselves. Str would need an extremely well scaling skill to outperform con. Even if a skill hit  times you would need  str to do enough damage to remove  con worth of hp.For dex gives dodge which protects you from melee and archers some more. Stone skin currently already makes you pseudo immune so its not that important. The accuracy helps with hitting other dex builds which is likely going to be a minority of your encounters if you fight a well balanced team. Crit chance is for damage though most pvp opponents will have high con granting them crit resistance. The damage increase is lower than a str build but its not that important because the damage you deal is only marginally worse than a str build when you fight against a con build and superior to a str build because the str build will miss their attacks against you.So what makes con the best? Simply put youre going to live roughly x longer but dealing half the damage of a str build. So in a direct fight the con build will defeat an offensive build before it dies. As for hitting evasive enemies let your magic teammates handle them. Otherwise youll still beat them unless they have over  evasion they wont. They wont crit you due to crit resist so they do roughly the same damage as you.The only thing monks do in pvp is energy blast and team buffs. Not sure if thats your idea of fun.,tosbuilds,d352r4h,1,t5_3afng

8028293,0,t3_4p5nta,As far as PvP swordies go the way I see it peltasta is the one rank option highlander is the two rank option and barbarian is the three rank option.  Frenzy only stacks up when using basic attacks.  Fencer has skill uptime that meets or exceeds fletcher so consider that.  Id strongly suggest highlander instead.  I think youll get a little more out of highlander than you will out of barbarian but someone who knows more than I will have a better answer for you.  You do have the  stun from restrain its not like youre gonna have a problem stopping people.

8046596,0,t1_d4kib59,Right now my PeltgtCorsgtFence is at the Cors stage.  Ive maxed out Jolly Roger and have tried out Iron Hook amp Dust Devil.  DD is pretty shitty.  It has an awkward hitbox that doesnt seem to catch mobs intuitively  and is actually pretty low damage.JR I got mostly because I heard about how you can potentially get extra cubes from boss fights and such.  So far Ive gotten one extra cube to drop from the  dungeon boss out of about  runs since I changed to Cors.  Its not a very good chance...Iron Hook is okay.  You cant move while channeling it so it feels like a pvp exclusive skill.  Not really useful for PvE.I dont have many options in my build though.  Pelt is amazing so I definitely would never NOT take it.  But Rank is a pretty lackluster rank in my build.  Youre options seem to be between Cors Squire Barb or Pelt.  That means Jolly Roger Repairs amp Arrest Stronger Barb skills or Swash  respectively.Pelt might be worth a shot seeing as how clustering mobs is great for Cyclone as a Doppel.,tosbuilds,d4kiht7,2,t5_3afng
8051982,0,t1_d4l3jyq,I quite honestly cant believe what Im reading.  Especially in light of literally half the stuff posted here  Trading ranger for sapper is an option that moves power out of burst and into heavy AoE.  If I were to build a build like this Id probably take sapper instead of ranger as I dont really like ranger.  However that doesnt define the ranger choice as lackluster.  Both are extremely potent.  Pretty much the exact opposite of lackluster.  Trading scout for falconer is an option that moves power out of general PvE and into huge density AoE.  We lose flare shot and camouflage in exchange for circling.  gt Yes the build may do better in pve than in pvp. So what nobody ever said anything contradicting that. I wouldnt define lackluster as may be better than okay.   No stretch of the English language makes this true.  Lackluster is a pretty misappropriate term to describe any reasonable iteration of rangergtroguegtcannoneer.  You could use these three classes exclusively and excel in PvE.  ,tosbuilds,d4l49rp,1,t5_3afng
