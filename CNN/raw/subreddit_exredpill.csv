6770738,0,t1_d0c3dfi,So I have some questions based on your port comment  gt First things first... how can you unsee red pill? Well lets reverse the question How can you see the Red Pill?gt You were fucked over by a retard who wanted to marry you but jumped out when you refused. Instead of concluding that this might have very well been an isolated case you concluded that most women are like that fallacy of compositionI would conclude that all women have the potential for doing that. I would conclude that something I did attracted this woman and therefore something about me is attractive to those women.   I might even conclude that her anger at the rejection made me unattractive enough to leave me.  I  might conclude that I have to be more careful because some women are like that and apparently since I attract it functionally to me I have to pretend that all have that potential in order to prevent wasted time energy and love.  We can substitute all people are like that and then since we are talking about a male female dynamic subtract out the men from  people and you get womengt You been hanging out in a forum of people who all have the same visons and will bully anyone who disagrees with them by dismissing them as Blue pill beta cunt mangina etc... By only getting along with exclusively these kind of people it preety much becomes a neverending vicious cicle of a bunch of guys constantly reinforcing eachothers beliefs as they dont really get along with people with opposite views. When they dothey dismiss them as beta feminazi etc... in a obvious demonstration of an Ad Hominem Fallacy and cofirmation biasNot really.  If you actually pay attention you get a good cross section of male population in terms of age and other variables.  Yes the average TRP subscriber is likely in his basement trying to not fap to the screen but honestly just pay attention to the people who make sense when they make sense its easy and does not require you to to do anything other than use your own brain. gt As psychologist Dan Ariely would say As humans we are very irrational and biased. One way to overcome this is to analyze our problems and decisons from the outside by putting ourselfs in another independent person position. How do you think the common folk would react if they knew about Red Pill? Wouldnt they say it was over the top and just plain silly? I know that just because most people would think Red Pill is kinda silly it doesnt mean its right thinking so would be incurring in an argument ad populum but still do you really think that women are psychopathic whores looking to exploit you and that this is some kind of dark hidden truth? Do you really think that the average woman had  sexual partners and that the majority of people would not know about this? That the majority of people would not know that women thats half of the world population! are some kind of sick fucks if that was indeed the case? Some Red Pill myths like women are not interested in monogamy or that they are the psychopathicaggressive sex are soooo farfetched and out of common sense that its amazing how anyone even considers believing it.I think there are people who are out to use you. I think that there are people who wind up using you because you let them and yes I think there are people who will use power  in this case sex in a bad way.  Power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and to dismiss peoples experience is kind of silly. These boys had these experiences. Dont knock em for poor choices further because they are trying to create a way of thinking that lets them counteract their own social programming gt How dont you see the obvious circular logic fallacies behind arguments like You are a beta provider because women want to marry you vs Women want to marry you because youre a beta provider? Why cant you see the Biological Determinism fallacy that is to assume that ALL women will exploit you because evolution says so as if there was no other factors in behavior like epigenetics and envrionmental pressures like socialization education and values and beliefs.All that is said by more mature  educated users is that women find a combination of alpha and  beta traits attractive for relationships and child rearing.  This does not equate to sex.  So if looking for a purely sexual encounter watch out for the girls who want me to provide other things while dangling out the possibility of sex.  I can go on and on but honestly your understanding of the red pill is on the same level as a lot of the lowest denominator users on there and if you do see TRP as you describe it speaks more to your interpretation and ability to reason independently than to anything else. oh and you can ban me for defending trp if you want just notice that I did not defend your interpretation of it I think your interpretation of it is either artificially shallow or plain lazy stupid ,exredpill,d0jqszu,1,t5_31r90
6989413,0,t1_d18fdhn,I hope people are getting better at teaching their kids about autism.  In my generation kids didnt understand and were avoidant.  We didnt know how common it was back then either.  People just werent diagnosed.  Hopefully the attention the disorder has received in recent years rubs off on the next generation... Especially the fact that its a really wide spectrum.I dont blame you for not understanding females and Im upset to hear your experience with them has been limited and colored with extremist viewpoints.  Why do you think you gravitated toward this stuff though?  I honestly take people of either gender at face value.  I see tons of people in my field and their sense of morality loyalty to their partner people are amazingly open to their doctors about cheating work ethic... etc has nothing to do with their gender.  So when I found the TRP cult and yes its a brainwashing cult I tried debating on purple pill but its insane to debate with a person who doesnt think youre an individual human being because of your gender.  I realized I was wasting my time with people who didnt want to change their extreme viewpoints... They want someone to blame and thats gonna be feminists.,exredpill,d18lb3p,4,t5_31r90

7317542,0,t3_4e6sm7,I may be a little late to the game here but here are my  from a realistic logical and academic meaning I have a graduate degree in psychology point of view. The first thing is to consider WHY hes on there. I personally am fascinated by TRP. I love reading it. From an evolutionary psychological standpoint the idea of TRP is based on sound stuff. That being said its an IDEA. The concepts that are discussed there take an generally agreed upon theory the evolutionary idea of masculine men and femine women and basically gets hammered and runs off with it into left field. The concepts they discuss as far as seduction and relationships are established behavioral psychology theories that got taken to some rediculous place. They are sound concepts but they are backbone THEORIES of human sexual behavior. Basis not literal. Second frankly its the Internet. Anyone can be anything and say anything they want. Like someone else said its a fantasy. Maybe he identifies with some of those concepts. Maybe its fun to partake in the locker room talk on the forums. A LOT of people ate not who they are on the Internet. Because he participates in the conversation doesnt mean he IS one of them. Hell I subscribe to the idea of gender roles but to that extent? Fuck no. That shit is as hilarious as listening to religious extremists. What it comes down to is your gut. Is he there for self improvement? Maybe. Reading through that sub there is massive support for male improvement through self confidence and fitness. A real fucked up way but its there. Maybe theres some aspect of his life right now that the void fills. The thing is as his wife you ALREADY know what his intentions were as soon as you found that stuff. Either you knew thats the ideals he subscribed to and are looking for encouragement to leave him or know its not that huge of an issue and you just want reassurance to not worry. Trust your gut. You dont need the Internet to confirm or deny what you probably already know. If there is this completely unknown secret side of the man you married that you are JUST now finding out about...  Its probably not a good thing. Bottom line you already knew the answer before you posted here. Trust that run with it. ,exredpill,d29yduz,2,t5_31r90

7581076,0,t3_4j2gyu,I admire you for everything youve done in overcoming the circumstances you describe.There are lots of things I could say but I think the main one is to recognise your conditioning.By conditioning I mean the thoughts and feelings which have become normal habitual and frequent for you as a result of your life experiences.Conditioning isnt really good or bad its just useful or not so useful depending on the context. Conditioning that means you regularly think and feel that danger lurks around every corner you cant trust anyone but your closest friends and you need to respond to any threat with violent aggression will be really helpful if youre a soldier in a war zone. But if you come back from that war zone to normal civilian life youll have real problems if your conditioning doesnt change.Many people dont even realise what their conditioning is. They just treat all their thoughts and feelings as true and real.But conditioning can change. That happens when you realise that while you cant choose your thoughts and feelings you can choose what you do about them. If you have conditioning that gives you violent thoughts you have a choice about whether you actually behave violently. And if you choose to be peaceful over time your conditioning will change too.So your family life and experiences gave you certain conditioning about relationships. Its not helping you. Thats okay. You can change. You can learn to recognise your conditioning realise its just one of many truths and decide whether you want to let it influence your behaviour.For more Id read The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey and Full Catastrophe Living by Jon Kabat Zinn.There are many fields that will help you accelerate the process of mastering your conditioning NLP hypnosis therapy particularly cognitive therapy the Three Principles EFT buddhism mindfulness and so on and so on.Incredibly ironically this is what The Matrix is arguably really actually about.The Matrix represents the world of habitual conditioned thoughts and feelings that most people live in every day and think is real.The choice between the red and blue pills is the choice that we all have every day  to continue treating our conditioned thoughts as real or to wake up and realise they are illusions we change and control. Thats all of our thoughts not just our thoughts about how men should behave around women.By taking the red pill and I mean the red pill in the film not the red pill lifestyle Neo realises that while he lives in The Matrix the world of thought he also exists outside and beyond it. This gives him power over it as shown by him stopping the bullets in midflight and so on.In the same way when you realise that you are more than your conditioned thoughts and feelings you gain power over them too.There are similar themes in Fight Club,exredpill,d33xjew,7,t5_31r90

I think the heart of most of our own views of the world is a tendency to put us as the victim.You look at the most evil horribly oppressive ideas and regimes or you listen to interviewers with murderers and almost everyone sees themselves as the small pathetic victim.

Youre probably not a millionairebillionaire so I wouldnt assume shes trying to be a gold digger like every guy on RP seems to think. Why would she lie and manipulate for fun?
