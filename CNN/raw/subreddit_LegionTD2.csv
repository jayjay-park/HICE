If theres enough interest well consider a Collectors Edition but keep in mind that were a small team and want to focus our resources on the game itself  thats why were doing a Kickstarter in the first place!Thanks for the support and feedback. ,LegionTD2,czmona6,2,t5_32uo3
10792426,0,t3_5ubkbd,Id rather have a well polished game thats ready than one rushed out the door.Look at rbattlerite the game had hype when its beta started but its population has declined and there has been a lot of doomsaying now this is clearing up since they recently hired a new community manager and theyre looking to address big concerns in the next patch and in the long run But nonetheless I think its a solid comparison.Advertising shouldnt be pushed until the game is ready and even though many gamers dont realize it a beta creates advertising in itself as you get people in the ones who like it share it and the ones who dont may badmouth it but even with good word of mouth you can get players in who will quickly get burnt out if there isnt enough content and that will effect their opinion of the game in the long run.So again while I was hoping to be playing by now Im confident in Lisk and Jules and I want them to put out a product when theyre confident in it not something theyre not proud of just to quell whining and will harm the game in the long run because firstl impressions truly are important.,LegionTD2,ddt5v14,3,t5_32uo3
