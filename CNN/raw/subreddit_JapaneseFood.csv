630733,0,t1_cgbyd43,gtgt Surely you mean shortgrain? gt Short grain is for sushi or....Does it matter if it has a hyphen or not?Imported Japanese rice is rare since they have a cap on exports and because Japan also has a ban on imports. The California crop has the same cultivars as Japan just grown in California since its really the only place in the US that has the climate for it. There is honestly no discernible taste difference. Also since OP said they lived in Ohio and had a mom that tutored Japanese kids I assume they live in Columbus which has a large Japanese community. At which the Japanese stores there do not sell imported Japanese rice anyway. I doubt OP would jump through hoops ordering rice online.,JapaneseFood,cgbyr1u,2,t5_2rncq

2271572,0,t3_2l8o2h,I know this isnt the traditional way to make yakitori at all so forgive me but its still damn tasty and pretty close. I usually will cut my chicken up small marinate and instead of skewing I just toss it in cast iron on medhighhigh heat for about  minutes. I pull em out marinate again for a few minutes then toss it all back in on highextra high for another minute or so until the smallest pieces are slightly burned. Every time it comes out tender juicy and flavorful. Again Im sorry if this isnt helpful but its the way Ive been doing it in my American kitchen and its been working VERY well.

7773983,0,t3_4lqjwd,Depends how Im using it. I like frozen thick noodles in soy based broths like kitsune or tempura udon. While living in Japan I would make a soupbroth using beef tendon daikon radish onion garlic green onion sake salt etc boiled until the soup was milky white and the beef was super tender...to the point the onions practically dissolved.  I would use thinner dried udon noodles with that. I found boiling then running cold water over them prior to adding the beef broth made them springier. Thicker noodles stand up to the more robust and darker flavors of soy based soups while I think thin work more with lighter colored salt based soups. Thats my preference anyway. ,JapaneseFood,d3pu7om,1,t5_2rncq
