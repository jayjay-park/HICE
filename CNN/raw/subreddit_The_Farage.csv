Impeach him? vote for someone else in four years? talk shit about him on the Internet as if I am the most astute observer of political strategy and international relations cause I played civilization when I was ? However for the sake of agreement I will concede that the apparent contradictions this has with his previous tweets are troubling. I will also say that I dont have enough information yet to see if this the bellicose warmongering act its being made out to be or if its simply some political acting. I understand if foreign policy is where you draw your line quite frankly this is not very troubling news to me. However I do not believe this presents any justification for demeaning the reasoning abilities of those who continue to follow him.I also find it a hard argument to make that this delegitimizes the td. Its a subreddit devoted to supporting Donald Trump and this situation hardly presents enough evidence to say that he is totally unworthy of support at this point.
