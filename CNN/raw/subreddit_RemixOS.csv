4413889,0,t3_3bi41q,Adobe has killed flash on android. You can try and still load it if you find an apk but it might stop working altogether with the lollipop update. I havent yet found a tool for game dev that is like Stencyl. There is a tool called AIDE but that is just for code and doesnt export flash. No vector animation software either. Closest thing I can think of is Touch Draw but that is just vector drawing not animation. I wonder if Animatron works in a browser.As youve found theres still a need for a lot of productive apps on android.EDITThere is something called Game Creator I just found on the play store. Looks handy but still wont fulfil your expectations.,RemixOS,csn6hr6,1,t5_37l0n

6355526,0,t1_czba3z4,I read somewhere  probably Android Police but Id need to check that  that sources suggested Google Play Services would be available in China this year. That however wouldnt really be a problem  its just a developer alpha at the moment  once a full public release is available they could likely release that with Google Play Services as long as it was marketed as specifically excluding China. Anyway  here is one report on the potential Chinese launch of Google Play Services  ,RemixOS,czc1xob,1,t5_37l0n

10778524,0,t3_5u5l98,Well the bootloader Remix installs is Grub which is the same that is installed by Linux distros e.g. Ubuntu and Debian. You can easily change the main OS in it from the commandline by using a LiveCD of Ubuntu.,RemixOS,ddrq646,1,t5_37l0n
