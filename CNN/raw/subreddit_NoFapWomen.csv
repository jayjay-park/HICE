9251005,0,t3_56wbe2,I hope so for you too..To me sex is so much better if theres love involved.When people are in a relationship for years you hear people saying  My sexlife gets boring But as I view it watching porn has a great cause in that.Always new dopamine kicks new woman new postitions etc.  Or toys..But I think it isnt about that.For me the key is to never take each other for granted and make time for each other.To never make it a must.And not turn to porn to take care of yourself only. And because its always new and exciting its often used more and more...,NoFapWomen,d8omrbh,2,t5_2zkpn
10634299,0,t1_dd919g8,Thanks I just saw comments on this post and blindly followed. We have a lot of time apart at the moment not a long term thing Im just looking for a way for us to move away from porn and when were finally living together again hopefully save ourselves for the intimate times together. I know a lot of people go cold turkey but I also know myself and how I deal with temptation...Id like to say I have the willpower to resist without having something else to go to instead.,NoFapWomen,ddcui0r,3,t5_2zkpn
