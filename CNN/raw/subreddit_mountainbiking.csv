1276615,0,t3_28ntl3,Where he got it wrong was seeing things from your perspective. He is likely a bike enthusiast so to him any bike under  is a pile of junk and buying new I would agree If they had bikes in the shop for the price range you want he should have sold you one. He was likely more a bike guy than a salesman which is a good thing. ,mountainbiking,cid8izf,0,t5_2qjoe

2651927,0,t3_2qbvpo,Ive always ridden SRAM no particular reason other than I like the way they shift and want the brakes to match. I will add that Im a bit turned off by the centerloc rotors or whatever is on some of the shimano hubs but not for any real reason. I had juicy xs then went to X trails. The lever bodies are nicer with slightly easier adjustments then my old ones. I use SRAM Force on my road bike. I like the lever action better than the shimano. Its not quite as smooth as the s on my commuter. I dont think theres all that much to screw up with the hydro brakes from a performance perspective. Just get a rotor size that suits your riding and weight. Mechanically I think the big difference is the shimano uses mineral oil vs dot  in the sram which isnt quite as nice to work with. ,mountainbiking,cn4qkau,1,t5_2qjoe

3648807,0,t3_2zidce,I find even just dicking around at our office complex after work has helped me with confidence on the bike.  I like to try hoppingjumping stuff as well as just going inout obstacles slow  learning the bike and developing muscle memory.  Then just sprinting too for the exercise.  Basically any time on the bike helps I would say!,mountainbiking,cq86w2s,2,t5_2qjoe

6203051,0,t1_cyuovvs,I rode for years in the winter with just normal mountain bike tires in the snow.  The first people to pack down the trail after a fresh snow fall would probably be added by fat tires but once its packed its a lot like riding in a loose dirt or sand.  Studs would probably be nice if youre riding on ice but unless its early or late in the season where you get thawfreeze cycles I never really ran into much ice or thought I needed studded tires.,mountainbiking,cyupynn,1,t5_2qjoe

8278884,0,t1_d5ceotl,The reach which is the length of an imaginary horizontal line from the center of the BB to the center of the headtube. Its a more reliable measurement than effective top tube length which is dependent on saddle position which is never specified.  The other useful measurement is stack which is an imaginary vertical line that runs from the center of the BB until it intersects the reach line. Women tend to have longer thighs than men but shorter torsos and arms. Because of this women specific bikes tend to have relatively short reaches and relatively taller stack measurements.,mountainbiking,d5cf3s3,2,t5_2qjoe
