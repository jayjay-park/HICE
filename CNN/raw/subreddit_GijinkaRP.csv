4678413,0,t3_3cvg58,Name Benji ScyzerNickname BugFaction LightAge Gender MaleGijinka Type ScytherAppearance At first glance Bug is not very intimidating. He stands at slightly below average height weighs around as much as a tubby Scyther and just has the cutest little canine. Upon closer inspection however a much fiercer figure can be observed. With an oddly toned physique a distantly cold aura and constantly stoic expression Bug can be very intimidating when hes not busy looking like an adorable little jerk. However such times are few and far between. This is only made worse by the huge green hoodie and baggy shorts he seems to be fond of wearing as their size only highlights his runtiness. Thankfully the traits he gained as a Gijinka make him look a little bit more credible as a fighter. Because chitinplated kneecaps giant insectoid wings and natural semiretractable scythes do tend to enhance ones image.Personality Headstrong assertive and serious to a fault Bug is the perfect snickersnicker student. He thinks he carries himself with poise and dignity both of which easily meld with his love for fighting as made apparent by the conciseness of his movements in and out of the battlefield. With his extremely goaldriven persona low tolerance for stupidity and desire for absolute perfection the boy can be a bit uptight when dealing with serious situations. He manages to be fairly affable during social situations if not a bit too stoic at times.BackstoryBio Being born as the sole heir to a pair of wealthy countryside entrepreneurs most people who knew the family expected Bugs life heh... heh... to be a tedious and stressful journey through the world of sin and business. This couldnt be further away from the truth as Bug was raised in extreme comfort and idle richness. In truth his parents didnt really care for much and were a tad neglectful of the boy not overbearingly so but they were pretty absent. Their level of indifference was pretty darn high on Lebowskis JustCouldntGiveADamn scale and it showed. They traded with dubious companies heh... heh... invested in shady projects and didnt vote during elections all in the name of saving and making moolah. Do they have elections in Kimara? You know what Ill just say that they do for the sake of this joke. And as Bug grew up he became increasingly frustrated with his parents apathy. This resulted in the boy becoming determined to right all oh his parents wrongs in the future which resulted in him becoming obsessed with perfection and hard work all so he could eventually apply these skills into his own career as a businessman his parents greeted this enthusiasm for learning with mild approval much to the boys chagrin.Bug never would accomplish his dream however because one fateful day he fell ill and was eventually forced to be confined into a bed. The boys father blamed it on expired mayonnaise while his mother blamed Communism neither did much to help. The boys condition was only aggravated as Bug started growing retractable blades underneath his forearms and two pairs of green wings on his back. This time both of his parents blamed it on global warming but mostly just seemed whelmed at the idea of having a builtin knife in your body and thus the situation was met with mild approval. As the boy began to recover from his disease the Scytherlike traits around and only grew stronger as time went by. Their emotions finally shifted into that of mild concern and Bugs parents sent him to a doctor who sent him to a different kind of doctor who sent him to a circus manager who sent him to the local pizzeria who gave him free pizza out of fear of being mugged. Seeing the chain of events unfold and hearing the murmuring gossip of the people around them Bugs parents realized that the boy had gained Pokemon traits and was now a Gijink. They were mildly peeved by this and decided that the best way for Bug to grow as a person who has a freaking blades in their arms was to head to that one Gijinka academy. So the couple gathered up the help and had them search for said school on wherever they could find it. They did and the mildly proud parents sent their son off into the world. Mild pride and equally mild fear in their hearts.PowersAbilities Steadfast Every time Bug is overwhelmed to the point of flinching his body subconsciously tries to compensate for this by pumping him with energy increasing his speed. Subsequent flinching causes him to stay incapacitated for a longer amount of time but allows the speed increase to stack. The power boost caps off after being forced to flinch four times but the time it takes for him to recover continues to increase exponentially each time he is forced to pause. XScissors Bug fills his scythes with power and crosses his arms before charging and cutting through a target releasing the energy as he does so. Fury Cutter Bug uses his scythes to cut down an opponent switching hands between each strike. As he continues to land hits the power of each cut grows stronger. Vacuum Wave Bug spins around using his scythes to keep himself balanced as he spins faster with each turn. Just before stopping he retracts his blades and punches forward releasing a fast but tiny burst of harsh wind. Bug Buzz Bug vibrates his wings to an almost insane degree generating a damaging screech with a decibel level comparable to that of a jackhammer.Ranking Student does well in every subject but fails to stand out,GijinkaRP,ctk9g3i,1,t5_392f3

She turned around quickly but saw nothing there. She narrowed her eyes eyeing the area around her suspiciously. Anyways she turned back to Benji putting her hand to her pocket just in case. I believe this Light and Dark thing is an actual thing... Simply because we have different beliefs. She shook her head. All of you at the little diaper heroes school believe that humans can somehow be reasoned with and theyll accept us with just a few pretty words. She shrugged. Sadly that isnt possible with the selfish scumbags that are humans. ,GijinkaRP,ctoyw4i,1,t5_392f3
