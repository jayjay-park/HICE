5950075,0,t1_cxzih4p,Draven builds BT quite early. His Q amp AAs both interact with BT making it super powerful. Draven does not stack health either so Vaynes W isnt as amazing.If Vayne does not condemn Draven into a wall she dies while Draven is just facetanking her. Ive done it so often. Its one of the easier matchups for Draven because Vayne players always go for the vs not knowing that they stand no chance against a Draven. The only annoying thing about this matchup is that during quick trades Vayne will condemn Draven and hell drop an axe that way.,MarksmanMains,cxzl2j6,1,t5_3b55g
6010482,0,t3_3xqob3,gtIs Cleaver still a good substitute for LDR?Its ok.  The only spot for Black Cleaver in your build is as a replacement for Lord Dominiks.  LDR is all damage while Black Cleaver itemization budget is also spent on health CDR and its passive effect.  The biggest problem with Black Cleaver is how much CDR gets wasted.  Essence Reaver already gives up to  and you can get the remaining  through Lucidity Boots Deaths Dance or Triforce.  Staying at  is viable too.,MarksmanMains,cy7i6ec,1,t5_3b55g

6096407,0,t3_3z0brg,I feel like a sheen item is just way to important on Ezreal not to build pretty early on. In my opinion you lose a lot more not building Muramana or Triforce early than you can gain out of a BF item. The passive is just way to strong on Ezreal not to.As with most things we can learn on streams if Challenger level players are doing something consistantly its probably the best way to do it.,MarksmanMains,cyilkjz,3,t5_3b55g
6113014,0,t1_cykgxtq,This actually takes more skill than people seem to think as often as it gets thrown out in my opinion anyway.To effectively harass as an ADC you have to be watching both minion waves not just theirs. Watch for when one of your minions is getting focused down and going to die soon. The enemy ADC will want to move up and hit it. Now as long as you dont have any CS that you will need to hit at the same time then you can move up at the same time he does and attack him as he tries to CS then back away immediately.One cool thing about Jinx in particular is that she can sometimes CS and harass at the same time with the rocket AoE damage. If you can set up the enemy caster minions to die while one of your minions is dying you can CS the enemy caster with a rocket which will deal splash damage to the enemy ADC who should be right on top of their casters trying to CS.,MarksmanMains,cykhj9u,7,t5_3b55g
6166284,0,t3_400jvh,Diamond Kalista Main here Kalista is atm one of the strongest picks . There are at the moment  outstanding adcs which are MF  Kalista  Lucian and Tristana .Imo if u want to play Kalista good  you have to practice her a lot  for like  games . There is a huge diffrence between a wannabe Kalista player and a Kalista main . You need to know how to trade in lane by knowing how much damage you will deal with e stacks on minions for execute reset. You need to proc w passive a lot in lane and you have to know when to ult. I would suggest to pick up a friend and play with him  bot KalistaThreshAliBcKennenits huge funJanna.Kalista is a strong SoloQ pick  because the most players never played against a good Kalista and dont expect the e dmg.U want to go borkrunaan  its just to good. After that u should buy situational  go ie if u are very very ! fed  go bt if u need no qss and some sustain and if they got like smth braum support  malph top and rammus jgl  pick up a last whisper.Furthermore she is good pick in SoloQ because  u can often peel urself.There is a other Diamond Kalista Main on this subreddit called abigwiener  he should be able to give u some advance too.In lane u want to skill W at level  if u have a ranged support and e if u have a melee supp. Then max e and pick up a secound point in Q at level  so u got that extra burst Keith does it too. U want to auto the enemy in lane if your e is up and then u have to to auto a minion and execute with your e  so you got your e backup .In lane u want to hop not directly forward for trading alway hop sidewards forward auto him and backup.In Tfs just stay back and spray your spears and press e as you will kill someone so it resets . If a jax jumps on you  just ult your supp and hop backwards and kite him to death. DONT kite with attackmove because it is a lot slower at late  idk why  bug or smth Play her  shes fun mostly if they have no rengar ,MarksmanMains,cyqjjny,7,t5_3b55g

6246429,0,t3_41419d,Where do you want your keystone to be effective?If you want early game power more kill potential in lane and burst in general take ThunderlordsIf you will have long fights or can stack it very quickly Fervor is ridiculously good it scales up to something like  on hit damage level . Ludicrous damage boost but obviously weaker until you get around  stacks.Warlords Bloodlust allows you to almost entirely skip lifesteal maybe throw a red pot in there and youre good to go. Plus it gives you basically permanently  Attack Speed when fighting champions. Obviously this keystone becomes stronger the earlier you implement crits in your build. The amount of crit isnt even that important there is an internal cooldown and IE  zealitem should already be enough to trigger the keystone every two seconds.So for example if I want to play Ashe and the enemy champions put a chinese wall of tanks in front of me I can think about either going IE RFC Runaans Lord Dominik and rely on Warlord to provide me with the necessary lifesteal or I can take Fervor build my BTMercurial and rely on the onhit damage to kill the tanks.If Im Lucian and the enemy team consists of  squishies Thunderlords sounds more exciting since itll come down to who can strike first and harder. If I have to go through a Mundo and a Braum Ill take Fervor and stack my on hit up instead of tickling a tank with a Thunderlords proc.,MarksmanMains,cyzngeg,5,t5_3b55g

6462029,0,t3_445n7x,Just too much focus on the mid game right now.Caitlyn is in a good spot as a champion its just a cruel meta for an AD with a weak midgame. Same reason Trist took a hit.So many Graves Lucian Ezreal Corki running around with big  item powerspikes shaped the meta to be very midgamefocussed. Dont worry keep practising her once the meta will shift which it will she will probably be a premium pick again.Oh also Caitlyn always had a lower winrate than she should have because Cait is the goto pick for everyone that fucking sucks as ADC and these guys tank her win ratio.,MarksmanMains,cznptzn,2,t5_3b55g

It feels good to get acknowledged but at the same time I still see a lot of ADCs making bad plays ignoring me when I ping them back so I can go buy and get mana also when I ping an incoming gank and start backing out because i dont have enough mana to v. Then flame me for their mistakes. I tend to tilt from ADCs like that but the ones who give me a gj I tend to keep it up.

6797038,0,t1_d0mqc1v,I dont think it would be fair to the reviewer to have to point out so many mistakes.  It would be easier if you have some legitimate questions about each game.  If you want full vod review of  games with weird builds prepare to be disappointed.I would do it but I dont see a point in touching that frozen mallet game.  You snowballed so there will be less mistakes to point out.  Theres also some debateable decisions.

6863643,0,t3_49qrpo,did you say BF into tier three boots? Into GA?? Ive never heard of that working. If you want early attack speed get a Zeal before finishing your BFSword item. Which is almost always IE. But AD is superior to attack speed in early levels and its not great to split build core items on most champs.If I ever build GA its th th or th item. Never before my core damage items. Even then I rarely pick it up. If you want an item with a fun powerup get Mercurial Scimitar. QSS active will help you escape many tricky situations usually a GA just lets you sit there while the enemy team waits for you to respawn. Also great are Banshees Veil Steraks Gage and Bloodthirster for ridiculous lifesteal better after you get a Zeal item unless youre DravenKalistaa few others.Tier three boots are a super late purchase except I like getting Furor early on Sivir for that passive synergy.,MarksmanMains,d0uaygx,3,t5_3b55g

7437128,0,t3_4h58v2,worth is a weird term. Its all a question of what your priorities are. The reason that Draven is so hard is that you need to know where you want to be positioned two seconds before youre actually there and your enemy knows where that will be. If you get good at Draven you will have incredible positioning which will translate to skill on any ADC. If you just want to climb it will be more difficult than if you were to pick up a metaADC like Lucian Jhin Sivir but you likely will find it more fun and youll get better at positioning rather than a focus on trading or farming. So again worth is completely dependent on your priorities and nobody else can determine if its worth it to you. If your priority is getting as much ELO in the shortest possible time then its probably not worth it but if you want to have fun and improve your positioning and multitasking skills than it very well may be.,MarksmanMains,d2njxr2,8,t5_3b55g
7556065,0,t3_4islzd,gtdidnt want a ton of gold on potionsgtGet back to lane get a kill and then I am way too low HP so I backI feel like youre answering yourself right there. Buying pots isnt really bad even if its like  if you cant get something better especially for scrappy lanes like that one.If I backed on g I might go bootsdagger x dagger or daggerpots. I dont value boots too much early game especially over attack speed but if Im fighting with the enemy a lot I like to buy morethanusual pots.Mostly try to figure out what you want to buy beforehand so you dont feel rushed and go dirk because you want to get back to lane faster. Ghostblade isnt really terrible on Caitlyn but its not worth rushing and only in specific situations imo ie not against big tanks.,MarksmanMains,d3136uk,1,t5_3b55g

7689387,0,t1_d3fmuh5,I know how high is magic damage is but you just shouldnt underestimate his AD either and even though his E is flat pen it does help quite a lot in the mid game. Especially in the past with the true damage on his AAs you would hurt tanks quite a bit but thats an irrelevant statement now that his AAs dont do that anymore. Basically what Im trying to say is that tank meta being strong doesnt necessarily mean that Corki sucks it is mainly his nerfs which did make him even weaker against tanks and with tanks also being popular now theres no reason to pick Corki over other champions. Also I do agree that if your entire team is AP and the enemy just gets MR that you will obviously notice the lack of AD in your team. ,MarksmanMains,d3g8fvd,0,t5_3b55g

The problem really is not that there is a casterassassin built for ADCs cause build variety is a thing the problem is more that ADCs in general have very shitty safety options in comparison to anybody else.

8194546,0,t3_4rjc46,I dont really play Quinn but in general you want some damage first before building attack speed there are exception to this vayne maxing W as an example. Lately on IE based ADCs I like to get BF first then my next back Ill get pickax if i can afford it if not Ill get boots and daggers. Ill then build hurricane and finish the IE when i can upgrading to Boots  when i have the gold. On quinn specifically looking at champion.ggIt shows the highest win  adc build is actually rushing berserkers greaves first then ER followed by SS. Not sure if I agree with that personally but I do think berserkers greaves are in a great spot and a better early item than a zeal since its  AS vs  crit doesnt matter too much early game. ,MarksmanMains,d51vc6u,1,t5_3b55g
