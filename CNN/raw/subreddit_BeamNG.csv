766509,0,t3_22xpf3,No its a digital download. There is no boxed copy of the game. You get instant access to it the moment your payment processes and you can play it as fast as your internet can wolf down the data.,BeamNG,cgreo6w,6,t5_2wf1e

3388698,0,t3_2yxrg0,Its not going to be abandoned. The devs are working really hard to provide us a fine tuned game. I dont think its going to be integrated into other games though because the game itself its very CPU demanding and heavy. So you can imagine what PC you would need to play an open world game for example with BeamNG physics.,BeamNG,cpeje7r,3,t5_2wf1e

6239675,0,t1_cyyuxi8,That video gets posted every single time someone says the Burnside should mash like a mashed potato. Its wrong.The reason the BelAir went squish so badly is because of its unique Xframe frame design. This was an early attempt at making cars safer by adding crumplezones  the idea was in a frontal or rear collision the frame would bow outward instead of not deforming at all like a typical HFrame what the Burnside is.The X frame did what it was intended to but as a result of not having frame rails along either side of the body for support the passenger cabin lost a lot of structural integrity.For the video the IIHS used the BelAir and picked the worst possible type of collision for that particular model of car to be in to demonstrate how unsafe older cars are. Most old cars didnt deform almost at all and as the OP said that can actually be worse. However it wouldnt sell it to your everyman that newer cars are safer if they used a more typical older car and had the  lose its entire front end to crumplezones while the s car bounced off with barely a bent fender.,BeamNG,cyyvtmk,8,t5_2wf1e

There are loads of people that play this game on YouTube and they almost exclusively use KampM.  If they actually gave a shit about the game or even cars in general they could get better but they dont so they wont.,BeamNG,d6do5ht,15,t5_2wf1e

8591970,0,t1_d6elzsr,Sorry for the delay the power went out and my last reply was... kinda lacking IIRC. Too lazy to open the subreddit to check it out.The other video was recorded via a stream so the quality itself is slightly pixilated. Furthermore my speed was set in MPh not KPh. So what little part of the spedometer you can see... is in MPh. Lol.In reference to the skidds I think due to physics or whatever if your tires are skidding theyve lost traction. You cant put power down efficiently and your speed suffers. I think that there are exceptions... but Im not skilled enough to know them. The biggest reason I skid is because the path is more predictable than trying to run a racing line with just a joystick. Its easier to essentially throw the vehicle sideways into the turn. Obviously if you throw it too far to the side you loose way too much speed if not control of the vehicle in entirety.After watching the video and comparing the time in my video to a stopwatch its obvious that the time is obviously behind in my video. The good news is that this is most likely caused by the computer being to slow to run the game. The lower framerate would cause the game to play slower than real time resulting in the lap timer being shorter than an IRL timer. All that said and done respawning will have the same effect over the duration of the respawn so I think Ill have to submit a flawless run in order to have a proper time. Furthermore Im going to run with only one checkpoint as that is the only other variable between the two videos.Its been a pleasure my friend. However I plan on creating a video of the above mentioned conditions before I declare myself the winner. The streaming service I use? Theres a more powerful version provided by the same company. Ill use that hopefully be rid of any lag and well see who really wins! ,BeamNG,d6fl4q8,2,t5_2wf1e
