Additives are an enormous part of the addiction believe it or not. And you might feel a lot better physically.Make sure you know how to open a soft pack right or youll have a bad time.Need a light?  Eleven gives away free matches if you ask.Dont by crack lighters. You know the clear shitty ones with the black or silver tops. They suck and sometimes stop working after a few days. Spend a little more for a Bic. Or get a Zippo and be badass.If you ever notice anything weird about your cigarettes even something that doesnt matter call the number on the pack and complain. Odds are the company will give you a refund or a phat coupon. I got a free  bucks because my Camel Filters all had different filter lengths.

9922436,0,t3_5hk67v,This is exactly the thing I struggle with as well. Its fucked because its not the type of thing you can really talk about with people nobody really understands. For me cigarettes are kind of an obsession. I love the smell the taste and the feeling. Nothing can mimic it not ecigs not weed. But at the same time Ive seen what they do and desperately dont want to get addicted.Its kind of a compromise between mental and physical health in my opinion. I started smoking because it was all I could think about  and if I try to quit indefinitely that obsession comes back full force no matter how hard I try. But I can last without cigarettes for  or  months before that happens so for now thats basically how frequently I smoke. Id love to not smoke at all but at a certain point I just cant really function properly until I have a pack. Hopefully one day Ill grow out of it or something but for now I do everything I can to not be addicted. I used to smoke more like you do but the risk was too much for my tastes.Id say you can do it. But you have to be really set on not getting addicted because its a really fine line.

Might be along the lines of a Kamel Red but I havent tried them close enough together for a proper comparison. The black pack is the full flavor Perique blend which is a little stronger than an average cigarette.
