It seems like if youre from a conservative upbringing perhaps the reason you joined labor is partly because theyve moved to the right and fit your current values better.

They do need your vote but because we have a preferential voting system youre completely able to vote for a minor party AND Labor. We should join and vote for the parties that best represent our values thats the way this kind of government is supposed to work.

I am really dissapointed you decide to decend to the level of labelling my points as red herrings your subjective opinion or not worth our time when people are obviously interested in the discussion. It seems as if instead of making your own points you are simply cherry picking the areas where I havent spent as much time collecting specific links nor do you bother acknowledging where you were incorrect in labelling my points as stereotyping where I went to more effort to collect valid links. This will be my last reply to you as you have demonstrated that you prefer to just snipe other comments non constructively.gtGMOs  their policy is prolabellinganticontamination but not antiGMO.One example of policy not matching actual demonstrated action did you guys not get the antiGMO protests like we did up here in Cairns?gtNuclear  yes they oppose nuclear power in Australia due to both experience and evidence and uranium mining ideological. Okay half a point to you.Yes and it is silly to do so. From what I have seen opposition has been both ideological and economic. Obviously ideological opposition fits into OPs categories but the economic reasons are definitely up for debate. Especially when they are almost the same economic reasons that people have been using against renewables e.g. too expensive at present not enough knowledge within society and we have seen how those can be changed through investment and technology.gtTrash blanket management  The Greens support fuel reduction burns. Again one of the instances where stated policy does not match reality. Greens lobbied hard in QLD and NSW for reduction in burning off and were pretty successful in NSW. I only linked Tas because both sides of the political spectrum were complicit in VIC and NSW.gtAnalysis of the  Victorian experience showed prescribed burning has little direct impact on saving homes but it helps manage catastrophic fires and native speciesIn your link it states that clearing around houses is a major factor. Perhaps again in WA this may differ but in QLD lobbying to prevent clearing around houses was done by the greens.As you also stated it does help manage catastrophic fires and if policy has changed I am a big supporter of it. This would score points in my book for the Greens as it shows they can adapt policy to suit evidence.gt AntiMining  you didnt provide a link but I live in WA so this is a pointblank election issue and the Greens have not been antimining  their position in WA is that their policies rely on mining both directly e.g. renewal energy construction and indirectly e.g. through mining taxation.Perhaps this varies state by state. In QLD and in NSW more than QLD they are quite antimining. Speculation here but perhaps that is more a reflection of residents attitude in each particular state. E.g. WA more reliant on mining  less antimining rhetoric. I would love someone to link some articles regarding the differences between state branches if they have them would be an interesting read.Also how can increases to the cost of mining primarily as taxation be represented as anything but antimining?gtHumanitarian immigration and sustainable populationI agree that they are correct in stating that efficient living has the largest impact. But unless we can transition to  reuse of materials which IMO isnt yet feasible but hopefully in the future... population growth is going to contribute to increased usage of limited resources.

Thats what we did after the Vietnam War  south east Asian refugees came to Australia in a decade  when the world had roughly half the population and it didnt ruin us.gtTheyre selected for resettlement by the UN based on how vulnerable they and their families are.Its not a competition if you are a person who owing to a wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country or who not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to return to it you should be granted asylum if you arrive in a country.gtNow theres a massive amount of people in the world who would qualify for resettlement far more than Australia could ever take in. To me it makes more sense to take in refugees selected by the UN from all over the world who may have been waiting decades for resettlement than to simply wave in any who try to enter Australia themselves.The problem is all first world countries say they want to do it like this but then tell the UN a number as a limit. There are hundreds of thousands more people that overflow from such a system.gtMy logic here is  if theyre just random groups of refugees most of them are likely not the most vulnerable among all refugees worldwide.Youre a refugee or youre not as I said above. We arent supposed to help them by degree of vulnerability we are supposed to help if they are refugees.gtAnd  if you believe that we should take in UN camp refugees first but also take in the boat people as well then arent the boat people always going to be taking potential places of the other refugees? Even you if increase the refugee intake the ones arriving by boat will eventually take all or just many available spots for other supposedly more vulnerable refugees.The goverment places the limit on numbers because seeming harder on brown people is popular not because allowing in  at once would ruin our country.If Australia were the country that took the most or among the most refugees per capita and were seeing negative social effects we should complain that other countries should pull their weight. But we dont see negative effects and in  because I cant be bothered finding another statistic we were th on the list of countries by refugees per capita.One of my pet peeves is people saying look at Sweden they let in heaps of refugees and look at all these social problems theyve gained we shouldnt increase yeah well if we lived in a world were countries like Australia had less than  natives per refugee there wouldnt need to be countries like Sweden with  natives per refugee.There are  Nauru natives per refugee for fucks sake how selfish are we?,AustralianPolitics,d2uhbuz,8,t5_2snwr

Not all corals that bleach will die but even partially bleached corals have reduced reproduction and growth for up to two years which is likely to slow or halt further recovery.In other words its got nowt to do with Global Warming...um I mean Climate Change.,AustralianPolitics,d3l3hpn,-5,t5_2snwr

7800482,0,t1_d3so04k,El Nino events occur when easterly winds across the pacific that usually drag hot water towards Australia die down allowing the rest of the ocean to warm up. As a result a hot wedge forms off South America and stretches across the Pacific. Here are the surface temperatures for the past  weeks and you can see that as the El Nino event ends the warm waters return to the North of Australia. The images you linked which are predictions of the La Nina forming currently clearly show the warm waters moving back towards Australia further illustrating this point. It is important to remember that ocean depths water currents and other oscillations such as the Indian Ocean Dipole also impact ocean temperatures.Here are the subsurface temperatures from  which was a neutral period and here they are for January  which was during the El Nino period. As is clearly evident while there is significant warming on the east of the Pacific the west becomes much cooler. You will note that Samoa is around  W which is within that stretch of warmer waters. The Great Barrier Reef however is at  E and is therefore within the cooler waters.As Im sure you are aware bleaching occurs when coral expels its zooxanthellae. This happens when temperatures rise and put the zooxanthellae under stress. A rise of only one degree Celsius for just four weeks can be long enough for this process to occur. This is very well understood by marine biologists. Initially you claimed that temperature shocks or rapid changes in temperature were responsible for bleaching. You are now suggesting that these shocks are actually occurring over the course of  years such as the rapid change from January  to January  In reality bleaching can occur after just a few weeks of warmer water and as I have shown before the major bleaching events of the recent past have all occurred during neutral periods.The summer of  certainly did not swing heavily into the El Nino zone. It gradually warmed over  and eventually entered into a moderate El Nino phase around September well after the bleaching had occurred The clear misinformation that you are pedaling which is easily disproven and the fundamental misunderstanding you have of the basic mechanics of the ENSO cycle indicate that you arent qualified to be making claims about its impact. Rather than cherrypicking lines that you can twist to fit your argument such as the Samoan Wikipedia quote or the reef fact sheet which makes no mention of temperature shocks you would benefit by simply learning the science.Im well aware that you dont trust scientists and believe that the raw data is all you need but scientists and experts spend years building their knowledge and experience to be able to interpret the data correctly. ,AustralianPolitics,d3su2lm,1,t5_2snwr

10641375,0,t3_5s7fbw,MALCOLM Turnbulls nightmare start to his makeorbreak year is about to get a whole lot worse.The Prime Minister now faces a split in the Liberal Party as early as this week.The highprofile Senator Cory Bernardi is almost certain to quit the Liberals and start his own conservative party.It would be based on his Australian Conservatives movement which already has more than  members.Bernardi is likely to split much sooner than later and not just because it would be awkward to face questions from his colleagues in the party room this week when parliament resumes.More importantly Turnbull and US President Donald Trump have made this the perfect time to start a new party for conservative Liberals fed up with the Turnbull regime.Bernardi has turned down all interviews lately which is significant but the logic all points to him breaking away soon.This could be fatal for Turnbull who is already badly weakened.He has been unable to stop hundreds of thousands of Liberal voters from switching to the more Rightwing Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party now with an astonishing  per cent support in the Essential poll. The Liberals primary vote has meanwhile slumped to just  per cent.Turnbulls attempts to start this political year with a reset have been a disaster.Last Wednesday he blew himself up in his big speech at the National Press Club meant to rally the faithful.Not only was his speech too dull Turnbull farcically promised more transparency to political donations only to refuse minutes later to reveal the size of his own donation to the Liberals.Hours later Turnbull tried to end the laughter by going on the ABC and finally admitting hed donated . million. The result this rather than his speech dominated the next days media.Then came news of Turnbulls embarrassing brawl on the phone with Trump.Trump has been understandably furious about a deal Turnbull sealed with then president Barack Obama just five days after Trumps election on November   a deal to send  of our boat people to the US.This was bound to embarrass the new president whod repeatedly promised during the election campaign to crack down on refugees from the Middle East.Not only did Trump end their call  minutes early but his spokesman then called our prime minister Trumbull.All this already makes Turnbull a perfect target for Bernardi who wont want to take the risk of waiting and having the Liberals switch back to a more able and conservative leader  either Tony Abbott or Peter Dutton.Bernardis pitch to disgruntled conservative Liberals would work much better while the Liberals are still led by a weakened man of the Left.But if Bernardi needed any more encouragement to split now Leftwing Liberal MPs gave it over the weekend by urging the Liberals to break their election promise to have a peoples vote to decide on samesex marriage.Turnbull himself has not ruled out letting politicians decide the issue instead.What a gift for Bernardi a Christian opposed to samesex marriage.Here are MPs ready to break another promise. Ready to strip voters of the power to decide for themselves. Ready to pander again to minority identity groups. Eager to drag the Liberals further Left.This symbolises everything Bernardi has been fighting against and everything that has made the mainstream parties contemptible to so many voters particularly conservatives.What are these MPs thinking? Didnt Trumps win against the elites teach them anything?Nervous Liberal MPs have asked me if they could still persuade Bernardi to stay in the party. Answer no. The Liberals  even Abbott  have unfairly treated him as too extreme to make a minister. As a backbench Liberal senator from South Australia he has relatively little influence on policy and cannot rock the party boat too much by speaking up despite being one of our most articulate politicians.But as the leader of his own party he will be free to say exactly what he thinks and his Senate vote now becomes one that the Liberals must woo to win. He also has five years left of his Senate term and a great shot at being reelected after that.Last year Bernardi spent three months in New York at the United Nations and was inspired to see what one confident man could achieve by calling it just as he saw it.That man was Donald Trump and any day now we may see Bernardi start the closest thing to a Trump party here.,AustralianPolitics,dddkrfk,6,t5_2snwr

10677536,0,t1_ddhaklg,gtSure a criminal would like to steal a semiautomatic firearm but thats why it is a legal requirement to have gun safes. The only way someone can take the weapon unlawfully is for the legal possessor to be at fault. This happens in Australia...They are complying with the conditions of the licence but we are asking those who are complying with the bare minimum regulations on firearms storage to think more broadly about crime prevention.The head of the East Gippsland Criminal Investigation Unit Sergeant Margaret Schultz confirmed some of the thefts had been from locked safes which indicated owners were complying with regulations.Its not been non compliance with the regulations Sgt Shultz said.gtI will use New Zealand again because they are the perfect example they allow ars and high capacity handguns and silencers for licensed recreational shooters why dont they have their weapons stolen and used in crimes?They do.gtCriminal enterprises cant coerce people with clean records to get guns for them because they are all required to be registered.Sure they can.You find a clean guy with money problems. You offer to pay for him to get a gun licence and buy whatever guns you need.A few months later the criminals organise with him to be robbed. He does a police report and all the usual stuff. His registered guns are gone thats sad. The police cant find his registered guns because unless the guns later turn up at the scene of a crime they wont be seen again. Its no problem for the guy who the guns are registered to though even if they do turn up he already reported them stolen.gtBecause that scenario never plays out in America where open carry is allowed.Its uncommon sure but thats because the riskreward ratio of blackmarket firearms isnt at a point where that needs to happen not because firearms magically stop you from being robbed.The point im making is that the more people who have guns in society the easier it becomes for criminals to source guns. I was just bringing open carry in to it because open carry is the time when someone is most likely to be able to protect themselves with their gun and yet also when their guns are least secure.It would be an absolute doddle for experienced criminals to follow that dude home wait til he leaves and then break in and clean out his gun safe.gtIf someone wants to commit a shooting who cares if they pay  for the weapon as opposed to ? Because  they can just use their dole payment and go pick one up next week. If it costs k theyre going to have to put a lot more together before they can splurge on that on a whim.gtAnd also they arent the ones who import them other crims do it for profit.Yes black markets operate for profits.. thanks for the heads up.,AustralianPolitics,ddhb2i8,0,t5_2snwr

10709294,0,t1_ddkknnr,That was kind of my point. Solar and Wind are renewables and they are intermittent but not all renewables are Solar and Wind. The false equivalency of renewables  intermittent is only harmful to the wider debate.I agree that large scale hydropower would be an excellent solution. One way this could be achieved is to use the excess of intermittent power when it exists to be moved in to pumped water storage. Rather than just being sold to the grid and displacing the demand for baseload generators which cant compete with the spot pricing.There would be efficiency losses of course in the power generated by wind and solar vs the power gotten back once its released to the hydroelectric turbines but i feel this is an acceptable cost when you factor in that youre transforming intermittent supply in to a renewable baseload generator.If one were so inclined you could even couple this with the currently unused capacity of desal plants. New dams in SA could be filled with desalinated sea water and their hydro generators could flow in to the Eyre Basin catchment area rather than Spencer gulf.This could create agricultural and tourism potentials in what is currently one of the most arid parts of Australia,AustralianPolitics,ddkl0ge,3,t5_2snwr
