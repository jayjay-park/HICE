5135932,0,t1_cv52ejj,Lol dude. Same I had been listening to techno and drum and bass alot and I was at this techno party back in  may I think?! Well anyway It was this big warehouse style  room raveparty and I wandered away from the drum and bass stage to another room and this song was just coming up n these fucking riffs made every hair on my body go stiff. I bet it sounds kinda meh for people who cant relive it live but I can tell you on a system it sounded fucking massive that day. Stayed until that room until the end  hours more and had a blast. Been checking out tech house ever since.,tech_house,cv52kvj,2,t5_2se7s
