7151245,0,t3_4dedsr,I thought the episode had a weird energy. The models didnt seem like they were fans of the show didnt really have any good answer and overall looked like they had been dragged into this.Bob Picking two characters felt like a cop out to me and stole away time from performers I thought were interesting. He did extremely well as both Uzo Aduba and Carol Channing and I feel like the win is deserved because nobody matched him as either characters but part of the challenge in SG is to pick a character you can consistently be funny as and picking  is a way to avoid that. His camerawhoreyness really showed through even when he was speaking to Acid about Nancy Grace. Acid could barely explain why she made that choice Bob was doing it for her. Kudos for a nice runway but Madonna had much more scandalous political statements he couldve used. Like hello she had a video of crosses burning with a black Jesus. Dressing up as a boy scout is hardly genius or shocking for Madonna. Robbie Props for the Little League idea but its kinda what were expecting for Seattle Girls now. Same for Diana Vreeland who was really played as a generic old woman smoking a cigarette. Seeing her make excuses on the runway was funny though.Naomi Urg she did so bad. She got none of New Yorks mannerisms or even stock phrases. Her runway was not bad but it was generic. She sold it well though with the ninja moves so theres that. Acid Betty Yea Acid talks a big game but really she had trouble standing on her own in this competition. Maybe its because she didnt have anyone to blame but herself in terms of direction for this challenge. She had none of Nancy Grace faux outrage accent or wig. Her runways was alright but she shouldve covered the wire holding those birds. And she shouldve delivered that baby earlier in the lipsynch.Derrick Barry I Shocantelle you she wouldve been the bottom  if she had not done Britney although I feel like her performance was very very safe. I liked her take on the kimono at least it wasnt an exact copy of the Nothing Really Matters video like everyone else did. Chi Chi Wasnt expecting her to do so well props for her. She made Robbie look especially bad because they were both playing similar characters but she put a twist on hers while Robbie didnt. Her Madonna runway looked much better when she  wasnt sticking her tongue out and she was cinched for the gawds. Kim Chi Im ambivalent about Kimmy JongUn because I feel like its a bit of a copout too. She seemed to be one of the only ones who had puns or clever answers for the questions so theres that. She really shouldve avoided the obvious Kimono choice for the runway. It felt like she was just phoning it in and picked the costume because she already had it in her wardrobe and didnt want to bother thinking about a concept for this runway in particular. Thorgy To be honest I though Michael Jackson was alright but she mostly reached for the lowhanging fruits. Her makeup was also smudgy at times and the runway was pretty much a straight up copy of the original Madonna look. That lipsync song choice was awful.,rpdrtearanny,d1r0wip,5,t5_38eo6
7151737,0,t1_d1qzbco,I mean Bob did slay pretty hard especially since no one else was bringing it as hard. I will say with Kim Chi shes so awkward in everything she does I cant see her as funny. Its mostly just sad. ,rpdrtearanny,d1r2x6w,2,t5_38eo6

8738814,0,t3_4zm4pv,Overall a fantastic episode! The entrances were a lot of fun and the main challenge was super cute even though I could do with the excessive reaction shots telling me how to feel about each performance but Im splitting hairs but Im not convinced by the new format tbh. idk the part where the queens are backstage kinda bored me. Its too serious and I dont know if its going to hold up very well as the season goes on like are they just going to talk about strategy and how devastated they are about potentially broken friendships every episode? I also feel like the girls are too aware of the kind of backlash they would get from fans if they were to sabotage another queen so I cant really see anything too interesting coming out of this tbh. Also Id much rather have a proper Untucked. The lipsync for your legacy is a boot for me as well the K incentive is a nice touch but I feel like the threat of being kicked off the show and the emotions that stirs up are much more powerful. I know reaction for this episode has turned into a pity party for Adore but the person I really feel bad for is Coco tbh. It must be tough shes a veteran in her craft yet goes on Drag Race and finds that what she has to offer doesnt resonate with the judges or the viewers. She really is tragically out of touch and it shows though. The Dorito compact was cute but she didnt sell it very well imo for me Alyssas gushing about it stole the show and then for her talent I think she tries to go for this cutesy s housewife gig but then she does it  sincerely with  subversive element and its like gurl... As for Adore she definitely had reason to feel awful after Michelles critique but she has a huge loyal fanbase that will cradle her and shes very cradleable ngl so ultimately she ends up the winner in all this with Michelle the loser. With Coco nobody really cares tbh and it makes me sad.Also can someone please tell me wtf is going on with Phi Phis mug? Surely shes more polished now but I feel like she was much more pleasantlooking in drag on Season . Also girl needs some Xanax or something Im not a fan but Im genuinely starting to feel bad for her. Its clear that shes not  comfortable with herself yet and shes trying SO hard. Its like I can feel her figuratively huffing and puffing the entire time and shed be so much easier to watch if shed just relax.,rpdrtearanny,d6y02hh,9,t5_38eo6

Despite this even if I dont think Gingers outfit is the best that week her outfits usually look finished and well made. This however looks amateur. Kinda like a rushed hotglue job done in the workroom as part of the drag on a dime challenge. So many misses imo The wig the shoes the train the lights that didnt light up on the runway yet when they did light up backstage somehow made the outfit look tackier.
