3282981,0,t1_cp2hdmd,Cool!  Railcraft has a whole signaling system to prevent crashes and rails arent TOO expensive now that I have a little alloying infrastructure.  Also for the time being the only use is for diplomatic visits like the ones I go on.  Right now we do not have enough residents in towns for travel...  I personally like highways.  Imagine trucks racing with food to deliver to the freezers in grocers before vegetables and beef rot.  I mean you can have that with trains but imagine a car producing industry.  Who will be the Henry Ford of the server?Thanks for a nice indepth reply!,MCDestiny,cp2hj15,1,t5_35e3p
