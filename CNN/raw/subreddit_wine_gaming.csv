4347874,0,t1_csezg8h,Winestaging If youre lucky its already included in your distribution.Enabling CSMT once winestaging is installed is simply running winecfg selecting the staging tab and check CSMT there.STAGINGSHAREDMEMORY is an environment variable. Simply prefix the wine command with itE.g. STAGINGSHAREDMEMORY wine ltgame.exegtSame idea with e.g. WINEDEBUGall wine ltgame.exegtHowever bear in mind that WINEDEBUGall it will hide all error messages so make sure to disable it if you need to get help or post a bug report. You can put those commands in a shell script for convenience later.CSMT will give the greater boost so if that was overwhelming just focus on that part first.,wine_gaming,csfqk4o,3,t5_2zg4c

Ive got those working fine the video this thread links to is showing the GalliumNine patched winemesa with opensource drivers updated to use GalliumNine but performance boost seems to be for Radeon cards only from what benchmarks have shown.

7997271,0,t1_d4eyqay,I want to say good because I havent found any issues with it as a demonhunter world map sometimes bugs out and you have to toggle it but everything else seems to be working great. My personal opengl concern lies with the live patch where Warlock Chaos Bolts and some fire effects cause the screen rendering to hang until the animation is over making trails. When they allow us to character copy again thats when ill make my final decision about alpha.,wine_gaming,d4eywwv,1,t5_2zg4c
