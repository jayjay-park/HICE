257761,0,t1_cf76v6i,The physical DVDs are cheaper but they dont offer kinect feedback competition with my friends points gamer score etc... So I think of it like an upgrade.As far as tracking goes make sure the floor is properly calibrated in kinect settings. Also try less baggy clothing if the sensor has a hard time following your limbs. Jillian might not be the instructor for you if you dont enjoy her motivation. Try MOSSA videos. I just started them and I find them fun and challenging,XboxFitness,cf7h1q9,1,t5_2yur2

1721428,0,t1_cjvx5ae,Awesome! Let me start out saying that you should be really proud of yourself.  Being consistent is the key. As to your questions MOSSA sells as do other companies barbells the long bars with platessaucers on each end with various quick change collars.  The MOSSA power video gives you a cue for when to change the weight on the bar. I always find it difficult to perform a quick change in the allotted time.  For me I choose to use dumbbells in each hand there is usually and instructor demonstrating this alternate method on the screen.  I have all the weights on the love seat next to my workout area so it is easy to reach over and grab the one that I want. That said I have the MOSSA barbells and bench on my Christmas list and I think switching from dumbbells to barbells will make it like a brand new workout! ,XboxFitness,cjw5efu,2,t5_2yur2

4056881,0,t3_2r26db,Hey there my gamertag is pmpboarder. Ive been using Xbox Fitness off and on mostly off unfortunately since the Xbox One came out. But Im starting to take it and my diet a little more seriously. I just turned  and I want to feel  again not . So far Ive been focusing mainly on the Athlete Fit workouts especially Russell Wilson  those plankstosquats are killer! but I plan to expand my library over time.Let me know if you follow me so I can follow you as well! I love the idea of some friendly competition and encouragement during workouts! It always pushes you past what you think you can do.,XboxFitness,cripqog,2,t5_2yur2
4167249,0,t3_37oz07,So is this getting better for anyone? Is there anyone out there not having problems at all?I did Mossa Fight  on saturday and the lag kicked in at about  I was paying code attention after reading this thread. After that I could score at most  stars for the rest of the workout. Racked up  k as opposed to my usual  range. The lag started out small then got progressively worse throughout.Yesterday i did Mossa Fight  lag from about  and out but not all the time. A few of the rounds seemed to score normally or atleast I got fire stars but in the end the total score was just over k.Today I did Mossa  again and I didnt get any noticable lag before about  minutes in. After that a few rounds seemed just normal and many were just lagged to death with the scoring not appearing before the round had just a couple of seconds left. All in all I scored k points.As a side note I did Mossa  on friday and thought something felt a bit off. The workout was going nicely got my  stars and so on but still I scored just over k and felt a bit cheated as I could not remember any of the Kinect doesnt see me at all bullshit that happens some times. But there was no lagging or stuff like that just scoring that was a bit off.Sure hope it will be fixed soon as my averages are suffering. They will be easier to beat later on though I suppose so theres atleast that!,XboxFitness,crv9vyw,3,t5_2yur2
4389350,0,t1_cskej4q,Started out with the free ones ten minutes of jumping around are enough for me right now. Started with the  Minute Solution doing Cardio max and Intervals. Was sweating like a pig! I can feel the muscles today.I didnt really know which ones to start with either had a look at the previews and thought that intervals and high intensity cardio are probably the quickest ways to get some shape back. Then Ill start adding more overall shape minded excercises. ,XboxFitness,cskezhy,2,t5_2yur2

7242786,0,t3_4em3bx,Welcome! Xbox Fitness is great for weight loss.  I have personally lost around  lbs my body just moves betterseriously fitter than I have ever been since high school and Im almost  now. I want to point you to our our sticky and in particular the intermediate training schedule.  This schedule uses all free with Gold MOSSA videos and meets basic CDC recommendations for improving your health. This is a great place to start if youre up to a place where you can perform minutesday of fairly strenuous activity see the basic column if youre still working up to this.The other part of losing weight and arguably the most critical part of it is what you eat.  I got the free MyFitnessPal app for my iphone.  I found that myfitnesspal has the most complete and correct listing of food. Log everything. There is some debate about whether or not to eat back your calories spent exercising. Personally I use it as a range. If Im still hungry after Im out of calories but I have exercised then I can have a snack equivalent to less than the calories I burned exercising. Spending money on Xbox Fitness is a good question.  If your internet connection is solid you may not need to buy anything for a long time since there is a wide variety of MOSSA videos available to stream with Gold. If youre having connection problems consider buying the MOSSA videos so you can store them locally. With that in mind the YO or JM Yoga Inferno are a good way to add a different type of workout to the MOSSA selectionsconsider using them for your resistancefocused days. PX for Xbox is also excellent and a offers similar variety as MOSSA.  Many people find it useful to change up the videos to keep it fresh. If you find that your really enjoy the MOSSA Fight the Extreme Combat is also a good buy.  ,XboxFitness,d21gafn,4,t5_2yur2
