900629,0,t1_ch6n6lu,Yes the relationship between Xiphias and FAGTUIA is a bit confusing it was born out of negotiations and considerations for the wants and needs of both parties and has been highly sucessful.  I am not sure what your citys worried or apprehensive about.  It seems to be some sort of fear of invasion.  A rail between the two cities isnt really going to do anything for that one way or the other.  If anything it might give you advanced warning over the prossibility of them using a secret rail anyway.  In either case there is no precedent for such actions.  The benefits can lead to a closer relationship between our two cities access to our infrastructure shops and trade and possible tradefactory agreements in the future.  We have our worries as well.  The NDZ has a tendency to attract raiders and griefers which would put us at risk.  And as far as I understand the UIA has lent assistance in dealing with those types of people on multiple occasions.

1952099,0,t3_2h1e6t,Bees declaration of independence voided any protections he may have enjoyed as a citizen of the DZF so it was actually he who revoked his own citizenship. Given that he is wanted for griefing Eros Varos and has threatened New Danzilona and the DZF he is banned from DZF territory  including Aegina Eros Varos New Danzilona Riverside Regency and any others. ,Danzilona,ckofjwq,3,t5_2vlsm
1954919,0,t1_ckorimq,Thats because bees had been conspiring against us and betrayed us. Obviously no Danzilonan would ever dream of giving up land to a traitor.,Danzilona,ckorrjy,3,t5_2vlsm

2094833,0,t1_cl63bva,Good thoughts axwin. Hope you return more in the future.I like your comment about big projects. It was really cool to see the pit for the portal farm dug out in just a couple of days with many people taking some time to work on it. Projects like that benefit everyone long after any single person leaves. Dan and I have talked about restarting the XP coop that is largely defunct since AMB left. Ive been slowly gathering materials for it and I hope to officially get it up and running her soon so that the town can benefit.,Danzilona,cl63lc5,2,t5_2vlsm

2590058,0,t3_2pecia,Im a little uncomfortable with the wording because it treats each entity within the DZF the same. However we have different agreements with each based on how they came into the DZF and I think those should be preserved until something else is needed.I guess my biggest question is what is the point of bullet  if Aegina currently wishes to keep the status quo with NDZ? Why not just focus on formalizing bullet  since what were really looking to do here is make our current structure official. ,Danzilona,cmwnogq,3,t5_2vlsm
