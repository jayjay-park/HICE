Besides Palestinian negotiators already all but gave up the actual implementation of this right and in this round it will also be up to the negotiation process to decide. If Israel expects Palestinians to give up one of their core demands upfront with such a cheap ploy they are up for a sore disappointment.The fact remains that the character of a state is not up for third countries to recognize.

But the Israeli government has insisted that compensation be tied to the negotiations of Palestinian compensation.  You cant get such compensation for Mizrahim without negotiations directly with Arab states. That is not contradictory on my part that is bad or good strategy on Israels part.And I am quite well aware of Israels attempt to either crush or monopolize the conversation regarding Mizrahi compensation. Mizrahi have yet to be compensated because the Israeli government and a few of the Mizrahi organizations have continually insisted upon linking them to negotiations.

616429,1,t1_cgabw28,He did not commit treason or anything remotely comparable to it.Heres a post I wrote last year about the Pollard ordealPeople really need to acquaint themselves with the Pollard case better. In every Pollard thread I see people screaming for his head on the grounds that he was a spy! but that really is an ignorant statement to make. Espionage is not espionage. In other words there are significantly varying degrees of how bad an act of espionage is and Pollard was guilty of one of the LEAST severe forms there are.Here are a few facts about the Pollard case Pollard committed a very minor espionage crime. Pollard was not charged with treason. Pollard was not indicted on harming the US in any way. Pollard was not indicted on compromising codes agents or war plans. Pollard was indicted on only one charge one count of passing classified information to an ally WITHOUT INTENT TO HARM the United States. That is incredibly minor as far as espionage crimes go.No one is arguing that Pollard should not have served prison time. He committed a crime and thus should have been thrown in jail. But the fact is that he has been in prison now for over  years on a crime whose median sentence carries  to  years.And on top of that the prosecution has been crooked all the way through this including reneging on a plea bargain deal that was promised to Pollard. Pollard never even received a trial as prosecution told him that if he pleaded guilty they would not seek a life sentence. So he agreed to that decided to plead guilty and then he received a life sentence anyway. Since then Pollard has been trying to withdraw his guilty plea as it was made under false pretenses but the US justice system has been repeatedly and unjustly telling him to screw off. The Pollard case has been an enormous miscarriage of justice and its time for him to be released already.Another thing I should add is that some people have circulated a claim that Pollard was guilty of passing information to the Soviets or to other American enemies but that is absolutely false. Both the CIA and even the KGB have explicitly denied this and Pollard was never even charged with such a crime let alone found guilty of it.The one and only reason why Pollard was given such a harsh sentence to begin with is because of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergers testimony at the time. He pushed for a sentence that was even harsher than what the prosecution team had been asking for and because of his respected position the judge listened to him. Well in  when asked about the matter Weinberger admitted that he had made a mistake as the Pollard affair was far more minor than he had believed it was at the time. In another words due to an incorrect belief on Weinbergers part he used his respected position to influence the court decision and he denied Pollard a fair trial in the process.And on top of that Weinbergers longtime assistant and confidant Lawrence Korb aka. the Assistant Secretary of Defense directly under Weinberger has also gone on record stating that he believes his boss made an error and Korb now even campaigns for Pollards release.The point is that Pollard committed a crime he served his time and he should have been released over  years ago. The fact that he is still in prison today is an enormous miscarriage of justice.Also Newly declassified CIA documents show that Pollard sought intel on Arab nations NOT on the U.S.Make no mistake Pollard committed a crime and deserved to face prison time for it but a punishment must suit the crime and in this case his punishment has far outweighed the severity of the crime that was committed.,Israel,cgac80z,1,t5_2qhvo

619532,0,t1_cgaiqif,Ill repeat to you a post I wrote a while back explaining exactly why this recognition is so important nowThis isnt merely some meaningless academic exercise in name recognition this serves a very significant purpose and without this demand being met there can never be a real lasting peace.Its no secret that the Arabs believe the land is theirs from the river to the sea. Everyone from Hamas to the Palestinian Authority believes that every square inch of Israel rightfully belongs to them and that the Jews have no right to any of it.The Palestinians dont view a sovereign state of Palestine with pre borders as the endgame solution for peace with Israel  they view it as the first step towards the endgame of conquering all of Israel Its known as the Phased Plan They view every square inch of Israel as occupied Palestinian land. If you look at official maps on government sites in school textbooks on news programs and throughout the Palestinian media the entire area from the river to the sea is labeled Palestine. The Palestinians dont differentiate between the West Bank and Tel Aviv. To them its all occupied territory.The fact is that if recognizing Israel as a Jewish state were such a silly and inconsequential demand then why wouldnt the Palestinians want to just humour Israel and just do it for the sake of peace? After all it wouldnt affect anything. The reason they dont do it is because providing such recognition has significant implications. Recognizing Israel as a Jewish state means recognizing that the Jews have a legitimate claim to the land. It means that the Palestinians are agreeing to roughly pre borders and it means that theyre abandoning their desire to conquer Tel Aviv and Haifa and Beersheba and Netanya and Ashdod and every other square inch of Israel. And of course theyre unwilling to do that because to them Israel has no right to exist on even a single square inch of land.The fact is that by refusing to recognize Israel as a Jewish state Abbas is saying that no even once we get pre borders our fight to end occupation will not be over. Recognizing Israel as a Jewish state would indicate a willingness for Palestine to exist alongside Israel instead of over top of it. Until the Palestinians change their mentality to allow for that possibility peace simply cannot exist.Thats why this demand to recognize Israel as a Jewish state is so important.,Israel,cgaowoy,2,t5_2qhvo

Hence blackmail it would have been a precondition if Israel had not already agreed apon the release beforehand.You dont seem to grasp what a precondition is Israel is withholding a product already paid for and asking for something before it releases said product. A precondition is a condition put upon before the exchange of payment and product. Now you might not agree with the exchange and i can sympathies as they have done horrible things and deserve to be in there. But this is not your choice nor mine. But if we want any chance for peace going back on deals struck will ensure talks in the future if they happen will have all the more mistrust why should the Palestinians believe Israel on anything if it cant keep its deals?Edit looks its not wrong to say Israel has made a mistake every country makes mistakes but it is by admitting these mistakes that we can improve and make it better,Israel,cgh69eu,0,t5_2qhvo

These are NOT first hand accounts because they are stories about what someone else did. I was there and I saw someone do something bad is not a first hand account its gossip. Its reporting on someone elses alleged actions. And as I said if youre not going to name the alleged criminal then youre not giving anyone a chance to defend themselves. Making generalized allegations without specifying who committed the action  is a way to bypass any sense of accountability on the part of the accuser.gt Why does it follow that not reporting to the authorities means they are not whistleblowers? Why is reporting to the authorities the only legitimate way to turn their experiences into political change?Are you joking or is that a real question? If you witness a crime you report it. Thats what whistleblowing is all about. Bypassing the whole system and giving ambiguous stories for the press to use  is not whistleblowing its demonization. If these individuals wanted to fight injustices theyd be fighting injustices. Making the guilty soldiers face the legal system is how you do that. Telling antiIsrael newspapers stories about what the big bad IDF did  is not whistleblowing its playing politics.gt You have obviously not seen any testimonials and have no idea at all what youre talking about  they identify themselves and what rank they were and what position they served in the army on their site its in the video and written down in the speeches they made they all started with my name is so and so rank so and so I was thisorthat in the army  here is something I did or saw.Again youre missing the point. The fact that they identify themselves is  irrelevant. What matters is whether or not they identify the alleged infringing party. If youre not willing to point fingers then your testimony is worthless. Anyone can say anything if theres no one on the defense.

Take noon naps while travelling in the desert and drink a lot of water plan for very high water consumption as much as  liters a day if your doing hard trekking. Consume that much water even if you dont feel the need water loss in itself is dangerous but your body uses water to cool down so having a lot of reserves is a good way to prevent heat strokes.Generally it takes between two weeks to a month for the body to acclimate to new weather and since your coming from a vastly different climate I would really recommend taking things easy even if you have experience in deserts you dont want to shock your body.,Israel,ciprbl8,2,t5_2qhvo

The overall goal of ALL their efforts must be the eventual victory over jews AND competing forces like Fatah and the establishment of an Islamic country ruled by Sharia.Thus they wouldnt even be able to announce any sort of reconciliation or ceasefire with Israel at all however a loophole exists called the Hudna and thats what this is. they are allowed according to their interpretation of the Koran a limited ceasefire as long as it helps their overall goals ultimate victory islamic state etc. So in this case  years of getting fuck knows what kind of advanced weaponry by ship and plane from Iran mostly and then they attack.Whats truly hilarious is that all the various progressive leftwing organization keep taking this at face value and you continually hear about the truces and peace offers and ceasefires that Hamas made and Israel supposedly broke.,Israel,ciz78z2,5,t5_2qhvo

Heres the current travel warning from the US State Department.  Theres essentially no situation under which Israel would advise or ask all foreigners to leave.  As uJoshgoozen said theres not much risk of the situation deteriorating further.  Scenarios under which it could theoretically happen though are all related to new fronts in the conflict opening e.g. Hezbollah getting involved and firing rocketsmissiles from Lebanon.  The only  fronts that this is even a realistic possibility from are the West Bank Lebanon or Syria.  Syria is deeply involved in its own civil war.  As is Hezbollah.  Lebanon has no interest.  Which leaves the West Bank.I guess its theoretically possible for the conflict there to erupt in sympathy with Gaza in which case the security situation in Bethlehem could deteriorate.  Personally I dont think this is very likely.  It hasnt happened yet nor did it happen during any of the previous rounds of extended fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza e.g. Pillar of defense though thats no guarantee.

Beyond that you do realize that if you chose to convert immigrate join the IDF etc that is a process that is probably going to take many months as a nonjew if not a couple of years by the time you get over there it is likely that the present round of conflict will have ceased in some way and even if it hasnt you dont just get off a plane as a new oleh and get handed a gun and told to march to the front lines of combat to defend home and hearth. Have you ever spent any time in Israel? Your sentiments in caring for your friend are certainly noble but you must forgive me it seems very unbalanced to want to move to a different country take up citizenship and join its army purely on the basis of that sentiment with no direct experience of what the country its culture people society etc. are actually like especially as a secular American who doesnt come from a Jewish background of some kind.That being said if you are sincerely interested in lending your services to the state of Israel have you considered volunteering for Magan David Adom? Its a vital organization staffed largely by volunteers that acts as an EMS service quite important in any time of conflict and blood bank throughout Israel. If thats not to your taste you could also consider the VFIs Idf base volunteer option you work and live for a time on an IDF base doing noncombat work and civilian support duties. You could also do things the old fashioned way and volunteer on a kibbutz thats what I did for a time its not a glamorous life by any means volunteer work of any kind seldom is but its an excellent way to live and work in Israel for a time and to contribute in however small a way to the Israeli experience.

1566311,0,t1_cjc758e,Thank you so much for this! I want to print your post out and frame it. As a mathematician this is the best example of intentially skewed statistics although I wont rule out simple ignorance that Ive ever seen!Pro tip you should be comparing the percentages of civilian deaths to the demographics of other armed conflicts not the demographics of the country in peacetime.First lets consider female civilian casulaties. The average percentage of female civilian casualties for armed conflicts in the last century is  regardless of the demographics of the nation this means that  women populations DOES NOT IMPLY that there should be  women casualties. Furthermore the Washington Post article you linked too is deliberately giving the wrong number of Palestinian women casualties to demonstrate run the following in your console when on the WP article    total    civ    .eachpfunctionie    ife.gender  Girl || e.gender  Woman ampamp e.militantcivilian  Civilian    total            .eachpfunctionie    ife.militantcivilian  Civilian    civ            console.logtotalcivThe Washington Post is deliberately exlcuding females under  when counting female casualties the actual number according to their own data is  or about . of civilian deaths. This is a a little less than average for most armed conflicts.Now on to the children. Again the WP article is misrepresenting the number of children casualties the actual number according to their own data is  not  which gives a percentage of .. The percentage for the Iraq war was about . Suprisingly the Kosovo war was only about . despite that whole ethnic cleansing business. Given that the difference in the demographics of civilian casualties is nearly indistinguishable between the most advanced military in the world and an eastern bloc state widely accused of ethnic cleansing perhaps shitty statistics cant really tell us what is and isnt morally ok in wartime.,Israel,cjclzn4,3,t5_2qhvo

1579415,1,t1_cje92p7,This lack of faith is precisely the problem and thats something that policymakers are struggling with more and more in my opinion. The fact that people are losing faith is not without reason. I look at the conflict daily and feel the same. Yesterday I wrote a post about how frustrating it is to feel that this will never end. But quite frankly that only inspires me more to look for a solution and not one that will never stop the problem.There are those out there including some Ive met with who think that faithbuilding steps and a change in the way the conflict is portrayed to the publics on both sides is necessary. Most Israelis have met very few Palestinians outside the IDF and most Palestinians have met very few Israelis outside the IDF. We need to encourage dialogue and that includes taking that step ourselves. Meeting with our opposites both within our society Israeli settlers meeting with Israeli moderates for example and outside Israelis meeting Palestinians. Its not easy and its not necessarily going to take a year or even  but the question of getting there can be solved. Its been a close thing many times. I share your frustration but I also think that we need to realize that even in Yugoslavia after so long of ignoring the conflict the international community managed to stop the violence. One of the quotes I most took away from my recent trip to meet with policymakers on both sides in the United States though I met with an Israeli Embassy official and former PLO negotiator as an example is that in light of all the mistrust they still say Peace has to come from the people not just the government. Governments can sign treaties all day and do nothing but its us around the world who have to accept them to let those governments implement those treaties.I know its hard to have faith but its not impossible. I could provide a laundry list of answers to each of your questions and its not guaranteed they will satisfy everyone. But if peace is the goal then both sides have to have a populace behind them willing to say We value and trust that peace will result from this even if it doesnt make us all happy.,Israel,cje9b2v,3,t5_2qhvo

This event aside how are casualty counts even obtained by journalists on the ground in Gaza?

Millions of Samaritans were also murdered and almost erradicated to this day their population barely surpasses Palestinians or modern arabs are a mixture of various people some left over crusaders some Greeks from the Byzantine empire who converted to Islam some are Arabs who came on from Syria Jordan and Egypt at the time of the ottoman empire there was no united Palestinian identity and the ottoman empire even called the land ottoman Syria. The Palestinians are not indigenous. This is just like the reservation system a Hispanic with some amerindian blood may have descendants at one point who were native but as they adopted foreign identity native tribes in south america and the us will not accept those individuals as indigenous because of their culture.On many DNA tests I have Arab and Palestinian relatives but this only means we share a ancestor from far back that doesnt make them indigenous to the land as they adopted a foreign cultire language names and identity. ,Israel,cjn6i7a,3,t5_2qhvo

Abbas said he would present his proposal to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry who will be visiting the region this week or next. Abbas said he would insist on the initiative even though the U.S. administration would not like it.Abbas has not been in a hurry to take this route despite pressure from Palestinian splinter groups. He said he had broad support in the Arab world and that over the next few days he would discuss the issue with other Palestinian leaders.Abbas associates are not giving details on the plan but say the Palestinian leaders will meet Tuesday to hear about Abbas meetings over the weekend in Qatar and Egypt.Were working on two levels that do not collide  the political and the internal a source close to Abbas told Haaretz.Domestically Abbas can suggest a new election or cooperation among the Palestinian groups until the election. This could win the groups support by reviving the Palestine Liberation Organization and bringing in Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Abbas might also ask the Palestinian leadership to choose a successor.Last week Yasser Abed Rabbo a key member of the PLO Executive Committee said the model for negotiations under the sponsorship of one country was finished. He said the era of Kerrys shuttle diplomacy had ended.Abed Rabbo added that the international community had to take responsibility for what was happening in the territories restrain Israel and end the occupation,Israel,cjzo9w9,4,t5_2qhvo

To claim every single Palestinian today is descended from ancient inhabitants of Israel is an absurd claim and one that has no basis in fact. I quoted the Egyptian historian Bat Yeor. A far more authoritative source than you who has provided jack shit to back up your statements.And theres still more evidence. Sergio DellaPergola used statistical data to determine that the Arab population of Palestine increased by  from  to  a rate that cannot be attributed to natural growth. Numerous other historians have estimated that anywhere from  to  Arabs immigrated to Palestine in the early th century.

2152596,0,t1_cldez9t,You seemed to miss the fact that the Palestinian factions have all withheld the ceasefire. Meanwhile Israel so far has been unable to maintain it. I suppose its a bit insane to insist that a viable ceasefire could survive while there is a prolonged military occupation and siege. The reason I included the Abbas quote was to show that I had hopes for the ceasefire but clearly this isnt one. Im not too sure why Hamas shouldnt rearm? Rearming as soon as possible is what any logical person would do as another war is inevitable. Israels already armed to the teeth and probably preparingplanning for the next offensive. In fact Israels already planning for their next offensive against Hezbollah.  Im sure they didnt leave Hamas out of their plans either.Moreover the army raided the village not the other way around. Its to be expected that people would throw fire bombs in response. Not to mention according to reports it was unclear if the yearold child was even taking part in the protests.  Now I wouldnt be to alarmed if it just an isolated incident. But the problem here is that its routine and its equivalent of one Palestinian child killed by Israel every  days for almost  years. Not to mention  the thousands of injuries.  Even during some points during the war in Gaza this summer one child was killed in Gazaz every hour.  And hardly ever does a thorough investigation get done. In fact in the past two weeks alone  Palestinians have been injured by Israeli occupation forces. Also the protests at alAqsa are not just Palestinians mindlessly attacking Israeli settlers. First of all under an agreement that hasnt changed and in fact Netanyahu affirmed this year the sovereignty over Aqsa is run by Jordan.  Palestinians fear that Israel is trying to change the statusquo at alAqsa  even Jordan feared this and had to confront Netanyahu himself. The protests are against the entrance of Israelis into the compound as well as restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities on Palestinians access into the compound.Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access into the compound continue to be imposed based on age gender and occurrence of religious holidays. On many occasions Israeli authorities are restricting access of all Palestinians. On other occasions access is denied to Palestinians due to the entry of settlers and other Israeli groups entering the compound protected by Israeli forces. Even Al Awqaf staff were prevented from passing through the gates of the mosque a week or two ago. And since  entry of Israelis into the mosque compound increased from a weekly thing into semidaily visits and then that corresponds with the frequency of restrictions imposed on Palestinians entering the compound. This leads to the clashes. Then recently as of midSeptember Moshe Feiglin deputy speaker of the Israeli Knesset went to pray at alAqsa and all Palestinian worshippers under  were barred to enter and pray. Feiglin did this despite the fact that an Israeli court banned him from ascending on the Temple Mount.  Hundreds of Israeli settlers have been entering Aqsa at a time under armed guard. And then all Palestinian men under  and all Palestinian women are prevented to enter. This happened very recently but has been happening all summer long as well  Palestinians are scared that they might be losing Aqsa. Palestinians have already lost pretty much all of Jerusalem due to Israeli landtheft or illegal annexation of Jerusalem. So they are afraid to lose Aqsa because like Israel they too want Jerusalem as their capital. gtGonna talk about the fishermen who insist they were within the limits? Since when do we shoot first ask questions later? Situations like that could be handled much differently. Rather Israel goes around shooting Palestinian fisherman on a routine basis. Its been happening for years.gtIm sure some do. And Palestinians firebomb Israeli police and military forces. Even checkpoints are firebombed.. And Jews are attacked.You mean a foreign military force occupying the West Bank? Foreign settlers colonizing the West Bank?gtand Israel is doing nothing it promisedIf a group of Palestinians raided an Israeli village were repelled and killed a yearold boy that didnt take part in the protest Gaza would be destroyed again. If Hamas shot down and sunk an Israeli fishing boat Gaza would be flattened again. If angry Palestinians built up a settlement in Israel then set fire to a synagogue like Israeli settlers recently have to a mosque in the West Bank  they would have been assassinated and Gaza bombed.,Israel,cldfzen,1,t5_2qhvo

On the other hand in response to the worlds lack of concern about internal Jewish Israeli refugees yes. Youre right. Another part of the argument is this Why do Palestinians get a free pass on the ethnic cleansing issue?If Palestinians want to say The deals worked out in the early s were unfair to us. We think we have sovereignty over such and such land  I might disagree with that. But it seems like something reasonable people could debate. I could also see room for debating a law of return for Palestinians and compensation for Palestinians who lost their land. When Palestinians say We think we have sovereignty over such and such land and the right to kick peaceful Jewish Israelis out of that region why is that sort of thinking not jeered out of polite discourse?On the other hand part of the answer is this Israelis suffer from a national trauma that makes you think of engaging in public relations or basic politeness is a weakness. You think that the world should see that youre nice because youre nice. When the Palestinian leaders go around acting like deranged monsters and say idiotic things Israel can get away with that because its obvious the Palestinian leaders are loons. When Hamas hires a good PR firm to help it package itself better and Israel steps into Hamas traps and bombs sympathetic targets schools babies Israel looks as if its run by loons and loses most of its ability to point out that it has victims too. Israelis talk about internal refugees and Palestinians bring out pictures of dead babies. And yes Palestinian got a lot of pictures of dead babies from other conflicts. It tricked Israel into creating new dead babies. Etc. etc. Lifes unfair. If Israel wants to beat Hamas it has to have the self discipline to recognize that self pity and asking why are they so unfair to us? are bad PR strategies and come up with good strategies. Israel has to start by drowning Gaza in kindness and by being the strongest supporter of Islam this side of Mecca. Israel ought to have an Israeli Arab in every possible public facing position.

Even if it is you seem callous to the fact that such a demolition causes unnecessary damage to the nearby property thus punishing other innocent people such as the owner of the destroyed car.

I cited a story that identifies this as a family home and goes into detail about the actual residents. You clearly want to stick your head into the sand on this that is your right.

2563176,0,t1_cmsplo5,I dont know why you just quoted that part but the fact that Palestinian newspapers  were using the term Palestinian is enough textual proof that the people of the land called themselves Palestinians including Jews and Christians. That is fact. I hope youre not trying to perpetuate the myth behind the slogan A land without a people for a people without a land. Its a defunct view. There was a civilization already in place on that land a civilization that endured many significant historical events such as the Crusades. As the Ottoman census records show Palestine was widely inhabited in the late th and early th century especially in the rural areas where agriculture was the main profession. According to Justine McCarthy p.  an authority on the Ottoman Turks Palestines population in the early th century was  and in  Palestine had a population of  Muslim Arabs  Christian Arabs and  Jews including many European Jews from the first and second Aliyah. As for common culture language and sense of nationality I hope youre joking about that. It really does make me doubt that you have Arab friends or even live in Israel since it demonstrates such a gross ignorance of the Palestinian people. But at the same time the Israeli educational system is typically weak when it comes to teaching about the history of the land. I could list a hundred distinct Palestinian customs particular to their culture that are not found anywhere else in the Arab world. And I could point out to you a great number of linguistic differences in their Arabic. That doesnt even include the distinct and ancient languages found among Palestinians although most of them are pretty much dead now.

Not only does it make Palestinian terrorism an exaggerated threat that doesnt effect Israeli lives but also it should be fairly obvious that all of this will end the moment the settlers will leave the land they stole.Im not sure why you have such a fun time misrepresenting my argument. All I said is the vast majority of these attacks are within Palestine themselves. Those settlers being hurt by Palestinians shouldnt be within Palestine just as Israel is against allowing Palestinian refugees into Israel. You cant force apartheid policies on Palestinians meanwhile Israeli squatters live nearby freely and then bitch and whine when Palestinians resist colonizationland theft. Palestinian terrorism is definitely an exaggerated threat. Less Israeli lives are lost by it then car accidents etc. There are far fewer Palestinians willing to attack Israelis than the average crime rate in most cities. You would never argue that those living in st world cities are under a daily scary threat. It would just be stupid. Same goes for Israel. Israelis in rIsrael themselves have admitted that there is no threat. gt it is obvious that selective gang violence that effects mostly gangs in the US is a good representation of the average crime rates in a western country and of the average threat on the average persons life.Was hardly talking about gang violence. Look at crime statistics for any major cities or even many suburbs. Youre more likely to be a victim in a first world country where nobody ever would argue their lives are under daily threat. On the other hand one stabbing a week or less within Palestine cannot be considered some sort of scary scary terrorism that justifies putting people under martial law. gtThis includes the Palestinians who suffer far less deaths by settlers than the average crime rates in America and certainly in any Arab country.Palestinians arent exaggerating a false threat. On the other hand they are still under a  military domination meanwhile they endure daily attacks and harassment from soldiers and settlers. Israeli arent being forced to live under an apartheid regime where the Jewish squatters down the street live freely. gtAmericans shouldnt worry about terrorism nor do anything about it and all lawenforcement activities should immediately stopYou seem to have missed the point. Israel is exaggerating a threat to justify colonization and military dominating somebody. Israel isnt defending itself by defensive means. gtan obvious fallacy of the human psyche that only Palestinians who have real grievances such as land being stolen by colonialists understand.You cant claim terrorism when youre settling in their country.

2737494,0,t3_2rdvs5,Awesome to see dialogue and understanding!I will say that from my safe perch here in secular and stable America you seem to be too hard on the religion of Islam and the quran. People were more barbaric in ancient times than we have come to believe is acceptable after the past couple thousand years of human development. Therefore all ancient religions have ancient religious texts that advocate things that we now recognize as immoral. I am sure that the torah is no less barbaric than the quran. Of my limited knowledge of the torah I know that a couple sections relate to things about the acceptable ways to enslave people and keep your slaves and how you should stone to death the village children when they disrespect a village elder.It seems to me that the difference is all in culture and worldview rather than in the religion itself. If you have a liberal worldview you can interpret the quran or the torah in constructive ways that can apply to modern society and you can criticize the quran or torah where they contradict with other important ideas. If your culture promotes a fundamentalist wordview that makes it impossible to criticize your ancient holy books then well thats where the problems come from I think. But between jews and muslims its only a difference in proportions and percentages most jews have a western cultural background and are comfortable asking questions and criticizing things and have the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution as part of their cultural heritages whereas most muslims have lived their whole lives in tribal societies where criticizing symbols of authority like religion is much less tolerated. However many muslims who have grown up in the US and Europe and have thus been influenced by a more liberal worldview and are able to interpret islam in a more peaceful way and some jews live in insular ultraorthodox communities where they shield themselves from the outside liberal culture and have very fundamentalist outlooks that are not constructive.,Israel,cnf8p38,2,t5_2qhvo

I recommend you do so the rhetoric and goals stated in there are not one of panislamism. They dont say first we defeat Israel and then we go uniting the Ummah they say their goal is a Palestine governed by Islamic Law that includes the modern day territories of Israel Gaza and the West Bank. The rhetoric is primarily nationalist with a religious bent. Palestine is mentioned quite a lot in the charter. gt while his followers in Syria are working hand in hand with AlNusra and dash. The implication is that they are pragmatic  in the near future when the Caliphate capital will move from Rakkah to Damascus I bet this will changeIt is highly unlikely that IS will be able to push as far as Damascus theyd have to fight through a sea of FSA IF Nusra NDF SAA to get there. IS taking Damascus is borderline impossible. Also to the best of my knowledge Hamas is not involved in Syria. You are probably thinking of  which fights for Assad not for the rebels. gt No they are Arab organizations. PFLP and Fatah are dieing and Hamas is FIRST and Islamist organization that says every day that their goal is to build an ISLAMIC government on the whole what it is Israel and they call palestine.

AFIK Hezbollah does not even have airplanes.  to Israel Lets say that Hezbollah get  tanks and  APCs and cross the border. Israel have aerial superiority and with planes like F strike eagle it would be able to destroy majority of tanks within first  hours.Especially in this winter weather when infrared observation and targeting of such tanks would be super easy.    Israel Lets say Hezbollah will send . soldiers across border. Again aerial superiority would be huge advantage and every supply convoy could be easily destroyed  cutting off invasion force from fuel and ammo after first day of war. THEN Israel would strike back with tanks and its own infantry. Israel would be on its own territory and with big morale. This is big power multiplier. Even if they will launch such offensive USA will send support. Even if they capture the area. What they could do? Shoot mortars at towns? And then what? It just doesnt make sense. You need to either crush entire enemy force or not start the war.

2972102,0,t1_co5wupy,Im very skeptical that Netanyahu is actually effective at reducing the chances of a nuclear Iran.  I think if anything hes increasing them.gtAfter all you might agree with me that if Churchill was the PM instead of Chamberlain maybe less people would have died in WW.Ive seen arguments both ways.  The argument against an earlier start to the war is that Germans had an earlier start on aircraft production so the Battle of Britain may have been dicier.  Also Churchill had advocated for a preemptive occupation of key ports in Norway and Sweden. That had its own risks too.Theres a great quote from Field Marshall Alan Brooke about ChurchillgtAnd the wonderful thing is that  of the population of the world imagine that Churchill is one of the Strategists of History a second Marlborough and the other  have no idea what a public menace he is and has been throughout this war! It is far better that the world should never know and never suspect the feet of clay of this otherwise superhuman being. Without him England was lost for a certainty with him England has been on the verge of disaster time and again ... Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent. Never have such opposite extremes been combined in the same human being.Churchill had amazing strengths.  He also had amazing weaknesses.  The situation in WW allowed him and the people around him to take maximum advantage of the strengths and minimize the weaknesses.  What are Netanyahus weaknesses in your view and how are they being mitigated?Churchill was also able to command the support of all three major parties when he became PM.  Do you think Netanyahu can command the support of the left the centre and the right in the Knesset?  I certainly dont.Churchill had been marginalized in the s for having defected from the Conservatives to the Liberals and then from the Liberals back to the Conservatives.  He was hardly blameless in that.gtSome people may say that the agreement that Obama signing right now with Iran is not much different then the Munich Agreement you just mentioned. The allies decided to sacrifice Czechoslovakia to avoid WW just like Obama willing to sacrifice Israel security to avoid WW but they were wrong.So is Israel Britain or is it Czechoslovakia in your view?  A nuclear armed Czechoslovakia mind you.Not to mention that Churchill made war with Germany but also made peace with the Soviets. Heres another s era quote from Winston ChurchillgtThis movement among Jews is not new ... but a worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality.Lovely. Do you know what Churchill did when the Germans remilitarized the Rhine? He pushed for sanctions and rearmament of Britain. The horror!Look my original comment was glib but it was also being generous.  The fact of the matter is that if Steve Forbes thinks Netanyahu is Winston Churchill Steve Forbes knows sweet crap all about Churchill.For one Churchill first and foremost cultivated good relations with the President of the United States.  Maybe Netanyahu should aspire to take that page from Churchills book.,Israel,co5xyuo,1,t5_2qhvo

But in Israel proper I never felt any concern never had any bad experience or even bad looks and I met with IsraeliArab families too in all kinds of areas. Its a different world from the West Bank.Concerns Anything over the green line needs to be carefully considered. If you go stick to more modern cities like Ramallahs good spots if you must. In the Old City you should be fine but if youre Jewish and still skittish just dont wear anything to suggest youre Jewish in the Arab quarter. Dont worry everyone gets questioned at security quite extensively its not just you. They will ask blunt questions about things like bombs who packed your luggage etc. when you leave. Israeli police and soldiers are in a lot of places including the Old City or Bethlehem if you go there in the West Bank but dont be alarmed at the site of people with guns theyre there to protect you.I wouldnt say there are any other legitimate big things to worry about. Israel is a fairly modern place for the most part really nice youll see a lot of beautiful and fantastic things etc..

If rumors are to be believedand in the increasingly authoritarian PA rumors are frequently the only form of solid information availableAbbas has been in and out of Jordanian hospitals due to unspecified ailments for years. . . .gtArticle  of the Palestinian Basic Law the PAs de facto constitution is clear If the office of the President of the National Authority becomes vacant it states the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council shall temporarily assume the powers and duties of the Presidency of the National Authority for a period not to exceed sixty  days during which free and direct elections to elect a new President shall take place in accordance with the Palestinian Election Law.gtThat sounds like a reasonable procedure. Its not. For one thing the last elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council were held in  mainly due to Abbas fear that his political foes will defeat him. Even if you set aside the question of the councils legitimacy theres little reason for optimism The councils speaker is Aziz Duwaik a member of Hamas. Duwaik has been arrested by Israel on several occasions. . . .gt The problem with all of these possible candidates is that they cannot put their hat in the ring until Mahmoud Abbas steps down dies or is incapacitated said Jonathan Schanzer vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and our finest observer perhaps of the Palestinian Authority. He does not stand for political challengers. This has led to an utterly stagnant political environment in Ramallah. And thats before you look to Gaza where Hamas has stifled the political environment completely. The bottom line here is that the Palestinians are suffering from political paralysis under Abbas and Hamas.gtWith no one on deck at the PA any talk of moving forward with a diplomatic process is moot.

Irritating the president and his democratic minions is a small price to pay for doing so.,Israel,cohckli,1,t5_2qhvo

3302640,0,t3_2xz4g4,In case of paywallWASHINGTON  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus speech to the U.S. Congress is over and the applause has faded but the crisis in relations between Israel and the United States is still on perhaps even more so than before.Senior U.S. officials made clear after the speech that the White House sees Netanyahu as the one who created the current crisis and so if he is reelected the responsibility for repairing the breach will be his.During his address to the convention of the proIsrael lobby AIPAC on Monday as well as during his speech to the joint session of Congress Netanyahu tried to send signals of calm and reconciliation in U.S. President Barack Obamas direction. Nevertheless senior White House officials considered the attempts too little too late. Obamas associates seem to have identified a Netanyahu behavior pattern  first he attacks and creates a crisis then he rolls his eyes and praises Obama publicly.Over the past six years there have been more than a few ups and downs in the NetanyahuObama relationship  tensions crises public recriminations and wrangling before the cameras. Senior U.S. officials say that to date ongoing relations between the two countries continue to function despite these strains. But this time they stressed there was the feeling that Netanyahu was using these differences  in fact highlighting and intensifying them  for his own political needs.Historians can probably find examples of times when there were similar crises in the U.S.Israel relations in the past said a senior U.S. official. In the last six years we had big differences over the peace process and on other issues but the situation now is extremely difficult and feels more politically charged than ever before.The White House is following the polls in Israel but is avoiding any attempt to influence or predict the results. Senior American officials admit that one reason is that they dont really understand the political dynamics of the Israeli electorate. Its safe to assume that the White House will shed no tears if Netanyahu is defeated but the presidents advisers understand that there is at least a  percent chance that Netanyahu will occupy the Prime Ministers Office during the last two years of Obamas term as well.Senior administration officials said the White House is not planning any retaliation against Netanyahu nor is it considering ways to punish him if he wins the election. Nevertheless the wounds caused by the premiers address to Congress are far from being healed and Netanyahu will have to make great efforts to restore good relations with the Obama administration.We are not the ones who created this crisis said a senior administration official. President Obama has another two years in office and we wish to go back to a reality where you can work together despite the differences. The prime minister of Israel is the one who needs to find a way to fix this.Dermer the instigatorAlthough White House officials dont say so explicitly they seem to imply that one way to repair the relations between Netanyahu and Obama would be to replace Israels ambassador to Washington Ron Dermer. The latter is seen as an instigator who concocted Netanyahus Congress speech behind Obamas back with John Boehner the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives.In his speech to AIPAC Netanyahu praised Dermer for standing firm and taking the heat in Washington. If Netanyahu wins the election and continues to back Dermer the ambassador will find himself isolated in the American capital. As long as Obama is in the White House nobody in the administration will work with him.If Netanyahu wishes to work with the White House hell have no choice but to replace his protg Dermer who is seen by the Obama administration as persona non grata even if they dont say so publicly.The prime minister who is elected is the one who decides who is the Israeli ambassador to Washington. It is clear to us that Dermer prioritized his relations with Congress over his relations with the administration an American official said.Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Dan Kurtzer who is close to the Obama administration wrote in an article on Politico Magazine on Tuesday that Dermers ability to function as the Israeli ambassador is now severely weakened perhaps even fatally so.In acting more as Netanyahus personal envoy than Israels ambassador Dermer has lost touch with a large segment of Americans  including a majority of the Jewish community that votes for the Democrats. Ambassadors are an expendable lot  I know from experience  and Dermer has now outlived his usefulness as Israels envoy to the United States Kurtzer wrote.In the days before Netanyahus speech to Congress senior White House officials gave leading congress members especially Democrats detailed briefings about the negotiations with Iran. However Obamas advisers didnt say anything about the lawmakers boycotting the speech or attending it.We didnt want to create a dynamic that will make people think we want them to boycott the speech an official said.The White House decided to keep a low profile and not to attribute too much importance to Netanyahus address. During the speech Obama himself held a video conference with some European leaders about Ukraine. The presidents first reaction after being briefed on the speechs content was also intended to downplay its importance.In the last  months Obama has met and spoken to Netanyahu countless times and always heard from him almost the same things about the attempt to reach a diplomatic agreement with Iran American officials say.Obama was not convinced then nor was he convinced after the speech to Congress. There was no new idea or proposal in the speech that we could use in the talks with Iran an official said.The White Houses main problem with Netanyahus speech apart from the political tension it caused is that it could enable the Iranians to blame the United States should the talks fail.If theres no deal its important for us to make clear that its Irans fault the official said. We dont want it to be perceived that Congress prevented a deal. We need to negotiate until the end to try and get a deal. But if we cant get a deal we should let Iran be the one who says no. In this case  new sanctions will always be a possibility.,Israel,cp4q7ei,8,t5_2qhvo

And yes if a recipient of our gifts does things against our national ideals of morality then why should it surprise you that it would make us think twice about us giving Israel those gifts.Israel is not entitled to our support. We support Israel because we think it is the right thing to do and also because we believe it is in our interests. But as an American Jew I have to say that there comes a point when supporting Israeli governments becomes a bad idea because it becomes the wrong thing to do. However I dont see a world where it wouldnt be in our interest to support Israel. Support would be lessened or broken over purely moral grounds.

It also applies pressure to Hamas which is a necessary precondition for peace and helps build up the PAs credibility and capabilities  another precondition for peace.gtThat and violence that is.

It was a mistake to think that a sovereign nation had a right to defend itself from attacks from its neighbors or terrorist attacks. I should have equated the construction of homes in West Bank ancestral lands with the firing of rockets from Gaza on innocent civilians in Sderot and I didnt. My pride in Israels response during times of crisis Haiti Nepal etc. was likely misplaced and I should have considered the resource constraints of other nations as well as the organ harvesting arguments of people online. My opposition to the BDS was perhaps a bit heavy handed and I shouldnt have called them BDSholes and begged them to boycott all Israeli parents in technology and medicine so that they might not be heard from again online and might not recover from illness.

3941424,1,t1_cr5imhl,gt But a boycott against everything Israeli even the most far left proPalestinian Arab citizen of Israel or Jewish academic doing research on something completely unrelated to IsraelPalestine etc. is discrimination.I agree but the way people see it Israel is an easy to hate label and many Arabs abroad have been taught that Israel and all things Zionist are evil and we act accordingly by not buying Israeli goods. The belief is that any thing bought from Israel will eventually generate money through taxes or other means money to the IDF or the Israeli Government which people dislike for different reasons. Arabs hate both because we are still at war and we still havent gotten over losing land and soldiers Im not going into the discussion over who is to blame for the fighting to begin with as it is pointless because Arabs and Israelis will never agree. Ever.NonArabs are mad because they see dead kids and crying mothers on the TV with all fingers pointing at the IDF or IAF. Again by paying for Israeli goods and services these people believe that their money will eventually land with Israelis responsible for the aforementioned dead kids. So in short The BDS movement well most of it anyway arent boycotting because fuck Jews but rather they are boycotting because they do not want to in any way shape or form even remotely purchase with money that may land in the hands of the Israeli govt or the IDF. Unfortunately what that means is that everything and all things Israeli will be boycotted because in their view thats the only way to ensure that none of their money land in the hands of people they dont like. ,Israel,cr5k0ys,-2,t5_2qhvo

3990230,0,t1_crb2v4b,So you are basically saying that settlers should set up their own state regardless of the right they have to do so. Sure it could happen provided they counted with Israels approval and active support. This would be a state no country other than israel would recognize or deal with. It would be entirely dependent on israel not least of all for its defense from Arab neighbors who would reject it in every possible way. Think Northern Cyprus but add an extra dollop of bad blood. If settlers tried to pull that on their own they wouldnt last one year and Im not sure that Israel would see this in its advantage. The world would not stop considering the territory as occupied and Israel as occupier. The heightened tensions from the unilateral change in the status quo would likely increase defense costs exponentially so if as a response the PA decides to disband.There could be some advantages on the other hand. After a few years perhaps the talk about repatriating the settlers would subside as they would not quite be seen as Israelis and just like now talk about repatriating the thousands of Turks imported to Northern Cyprus is barely brought up anymore. And perhaps at some point in the future Israel would play Greece too and push for its own enosis with the Judean state.All in all a bit farfetched and the whole mess would just as likely hasten the current trend in the international consensus away from a twostate solution and towards something more South Africanish.

4161859,0,t1_crunkib,gtI never demanded that and never would.Sometimes words have unintended implications.gtThats being a bit generous to Netanyahu there. He actually asked Palestinians to accept certain settlements as permanent which theres no way they will before a final settlement. I agree with your general point though  theres an opportunity here for the Palestinians to build on what Netanyahu said and actually accomplish something and they chose not to. But what Bibi did there is exactly what Im suggesting he should do more of!His suggestion was widely panned. No matter how much he does it will not solve the issue which is Israels inability to explain these facts. Once they do that it will be different. Doing more of it has a moral imperative but not a PR one. It will make no difference PRwise.gtAnd all these things improved Israels standing in the world. Why do you think they didnt?They did not. The delineating of borders was widely panned the world has gone back to saying Israel is not serious including President Obama and the moratorium has been all but forgotten as the world demands Israel freeze settlements again despite that doing nothing for talks.gt What the world sees is both sides obstructing peace. Theres no denying that some of these settlements or at least the way Israel administers them is a major irritant.Absolutely but the world doesnt seem them as an irritant they see it as the cause for conflict. The common refrain is If Israel were serious about peace they wouldnt be stealing land. What is uncommon is for someone to say Wait a minute theyve built most of the new settlements in alreadyexisting blocs theyve offered to evacuate more than  settlers and none of that was enough. Maybe its Palestinians who need to do something.gtThey werent ignored. But  is exactly what I would not suggest  acting unilaterally and in a way that ultimately harmed Israels security. Im not suggesting something similar to that should happen ever again.And yet the action was praised initially by the EU. But when Israel proved that Palestinians were not ready or willing to accept good faith gestures or peace and it did negotiate disengagement agreements with the Palestinians I might add in the  withdrawal the world forgot within a year or two. Because that is what it does. Goodwill disappears. And Israel can only give so much before it runs out of things to give and must begin hurting itself even more.gtThose are good but keep in mind that Israel also makes it challenging for the PA to build its own water and power infrastructure.Actually the PA makes it difficult for infrastructure to be built. They refuse to cooperate in the JWC because providing waters to settlers is now worth dehydrating their own citizens and wasting water. Even so Israel has moved forward with building water infrastructure in places like Rawabi despite JWC obstruction and gridlock.gt Id argue this is a very bad policy on Israels part by the way.No amount of concessions including those that hurt Israel will change opinion. Only a change of language and a real vetted look at facts will do that. Israel could change policies that are immoral absolutely and it should for that reason though we may disagree on what those are specifically. But they will not change the overall perspective. If doing something that harms Israel to get the chance at peace can create so little goodwill that it has dissipated by now then no amount of policies that dont harm Israel will succeed.,Israel,cruntyc,1,t5_2qhvo

Hamas hadnt yet seized control or looked poised to win an election but it had already won before  and Fatah was still paying the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade then.gtHere were talking about a theoretical agreement with the PA thought. So itd be a hey PA do you want control over much of the Jordan Valley? Ok but we have conditions   . If they say no then status quo in the Jordan Valley.Can you imagine the outcry? The PA wouldnt just be cooperating with occupation forces it would be cooperating in apartheid wall construction. If you want to destroy the PA just suggest that. Actually the mere suggestion or offer to the PA will make them look bad and draw suspicion to them.gtPerhaps. Id suggest putting it forward as an interim measure. I think thats how Netanyahu should have put his settlements thing at least if he wanted to follow through on it he probably had some reservations on that for obvious reasons.He did put it forward as an interim measure but like I said the interim nature of the thing doesnt mean it would work well nor would it be good for the PA or Israel.gtIf its not sold as something that would be permanent either de factor or de jure and if there arent settlers behind it.Palestinians would not believe it was temporary. It would make things worse for the PA.gtThanks. And yah I think were more or less on the same page there.

4568770,0,t1_ct6fdj4,gtabout what... reflection or embarrassment at the destruction. The loss of life from laser guided bombs and the wholesale devastation from mortars and tanks. The destitution of so many in the Gaza strip. Im embarrassed that my country facilitated some of this. I live far away in a cold and peaceful place. Edinburgh in Scotland and soon we move to Denmark. The last time I was in Israel was in the early s and I was still quite young. But I remember being there. I remember Jerusalem and the kibbutz that we visited. Carrots that were unlike anything I had ever tasted. I remember the sea of Galilee and the fish thrashing at our ankles. We were just tourists. The country has changed dramatically in the time that I have been alive. The situation has hopefully no consequence for me personally. Aside from the possibility of a future war which could escalate out of control. Which is hopefully unlikely. And my preference to see a peaceful equitable resolution. The whole situation is interesting to me but my opinion is of no consequence.When I look at Gaza and Israel really I dont know of any other modern developed country who has deliberately done anything comparable to this. And as the video says where the majority of the population are so young. Who were born in this really desperate situation. You need to look back through history to find such hopeless conditions imposed on a people. In all honest this all seems all too reminiscent of what happened to the Jews of Warsaw in occupied Poland. I find it unsettling that the same people who were subject to such brutal oppression could within one lifetime become the ones dehumanising another people with such apparent antipathy. The Nazis are remembered with utter revulsion for their behaviour. I wonder how people will remember contemporary Israel. Extremely unfavourably I expect. I have one Israeli friend but I think he is probably quite uncommon. He had to fake insanity to avoid the military draft and now lives in Ireland with his girlfriend. The viewpoints I see on this sub are uncompromising and quite unashamedly aggressive. Even your response seeks to suggest some crappy rockets are somehow valid justification. As if this military obliteration of Gaza is somehow reasonable or justified or warranted by these piss poor rockets. It really seems to be a most ludicrous viewpoint. Its an unsustainable attitude which is not going unnoticed by the people around the world. I wanted to see if risrael would talk about this and I wanted to see what justification or explanation might be offered but instead Ive seen a series of offhand remarks and downvotes. Stuff about rockets. Nothing comparable. Which suggests to me that people really dont want to think about what happens over the wall and to the people of Gaza. I struggle to understand how this can be rationalised by the average people in Israel. But Ive not been exposed to your media and Ive not witnessed your culture so I can only form an opinion of what ordinary people really think based on the comments on a forum like this. It seems to me that this sub is an embarrassment. An insular and blinkered echo chamber which is incapable of grasping the thorny issues with any real honesty. Or perhaps its a disturbing reflection of average opinion I can only guess. One thing is certain. I wont be going to Israel any time soon. or everIncidentally despite the claims of many people in this sub the UK mainstream media including the BBC are overwhelmingly favourable towards the Israeli position. They attempt balance and are immediately under attack from the Israel lobby and media watchdogs. London politicians are pitifully obedient when it comes to Israel.I would like to see the situation resolved but instead I expect Israel will seek some kind of gradual final solution. Or maybe something more sudden. I read about Israeli politicians suggesting the utter annihilation of the entire Palestinian population. And then realise with horror that the same politician is subsequently appointed Justice minister.Or how about this guy.I think the problems would be solvable if there was a real desire to reach a solution. But instead I see wordgames and weak justifications trotted out by a government and a people it seems who simply want everything their own way and quite literally do not care who dies in the process or whose lives are ruined in the process. As long as the deaths are not their people and not their children. It should make you more uncomfortable than it does me because it is the people of Israel who will have to contend with the consequences of what is happening. Im just an observer.I read the posts on risrael and I often see claims of antiSemitism or complaints of propaganda people cry about being victimised. I think there is a tremendous desire to identify as victims. But ultimately you wont win the argument because your position is untenable. You cant fool all the people all the time.The US and the UK and all of their support couldnt stop South Africa from the failure of Apartheid. America is now showing signs that it is losing patience.

I mean they are living there?I dont see why that would be true especially since there are plenty of people who live in Israel and arent zionists.gtAlso who is an antiZionistAnybody who disagrees that Jewish is a national identity or that Israel is the national homeland for that national identity or who disagrees with the concept of nationalism in general.  I think people who agree with the premise of zionism as I defined it but dont think that Israel is the exclusive national homeland of the Jewish people i.e. its also the homeland for palestinians sometimes refer to themselves as antizionists but that might be just to create a contrast between themselves and zionists.gtBut what does heshe want if he she were given the authority to do?I wont make any generalizations for specific policies that all antizionists or notzionists share and I wouldnt believe anybody that did make such a generalization unless they had very strong evidence.,Israel,ct8tq82,2,t5_2qhvo

I dont know if youd heard but a former employee is now suing them for being antiAmerican antiSemitic and sexist. Three women executives left Al Jazeera America it switched CEOs if I remember rightly and another former executive came forward to sue Al Jazeera America recently as well alleging that nonArab and nonmale workers were treated as secondclass in the company and that nonArabs were passed over for jobs that Arab employees were given instead.And this is the tip of the iceberg.Theres the time Al Jazeera caused a firestorm on the web claiming that Israel opened dams to flood Gaza intentionally...flooding dams that dont exist. This goes back to  when Fouad Ajami professorjournalist wrote in the NY Times that The channels policy was firm Palestinians who fell to Israeli gunfire were martyrs Israelis killed by Palestinians were Israelis killed by Palestinians. And it has been constant since as they congratulate those who kill Israeli civilians and invite Israelis on for short interrogations as one Israeli described it as a fig leaf to say they allow both sides of an issue.

However its recently come to my attention that the other mods are working on a filtering option that will hide politics from the feeds of people whom choose to do so. Therefore theres not much of a need for rIsrael because now we can choose to participate in the circlejerk or not. I always said that we should keep Israel together as a community and not split up but that the politics were so bad that it necessitated it.Hopefully this will be resolved with the implementation of filters. People who want a sub mostly geared to Israelis are welcome to use rIsrael or anywhere else they see fit.

Nobody ever thought to upgrade the stalls so that the ringer could bag or someone else could instead of the customer.Even at Osher Ad in Talpiyot on Thursday or Friday they still have yet to figure out that baggers would get rid of people faster....so..workers work overtime and customers get spoiled cold foods because waiting an hour in line and then another m for a bus in the summer sun means your food is toast....especially when that m bus ride turns into a traffichour m or more.These are seemingly simple things but youd think with people coming from more efficient countries theyd have gotten through some how to figuring out how.gtNot understanding the copsI live in Jerusalem...and a lot of stuff that goes down between Arabs and Jews tends to go in the Arabs favor because the cops would rather someone get hurt to prevent a riot........Nir Barakat our mayor is willing to get out of his privately chaffeured car and tackle a knife wielding maniac but Gd forbid someone gets beat up in an alleyway in the Old City or Har HaZeitim or somewhere on that side.....Cant go in there..No...They might riot..

Hes hoping for a crusade.gtthen not only does that constitute yet another serious indictment of Islam but its also an inherently flawed strategyAgain its not a flawed strategy because Tarek isnt trying to reform Islam. Hes aiming at its total destruction and has dedicated his career to trying to get the West to do that.gtIf what you say is true then Tarek will only become more and more bitter about the fact that he has to lie about his true feelings in order to achieve his goals. Hopefully his semipassiveaggressive facebook posts become more and more blatant until he finally feels the need to own up to what he really believes.To repeat for the umpteenth time his FB posts show that hes an atheist.gtBut let me get this straight. Ive shown for a fact that Tarek Fatah has explicitly stated the exact views I ascribed to him for which you called me ignorant. Do you care to take any of that back or admit that you were wrong? Because as far as I see it you have changed your argument. Youve made it about what Fatah secretly believes  and not about what he expresses publicly Again you misunderstand. Tarek because hes Muslim in public can only talk in certain ways to certain audiences. Watch his appearances with Michael Coren on YouTube and you will see a different Tarek. and follow his facebook stuff.,Israel,cux8q66,1,t5_2qhvo

This will make it a whole lot easier in getting citizenship  which in turn makes life much easier.  As for actual religious practices  most of Israels Jews are somewhere on the spectrum between secularatheist and mildly religious and then there are the Orthodox Jews who are mostly gathered in their own communities in select locations around the country Jerusalem Bnei Brak Beit Shemesh etc. or in specific neighbourhoods in cities Rehovot for example has a pretty large Orthodox demography  but they all live in the same few neighbourhoods.  So no worries about living an atheistic life  no one will condemn you for it or treat you differently aside for the most hardcore religious Jews that is.

For the record when I say Palestinian I am referring to persons who are not Israeli citizens.In what country in the world are noncitizens able to freely move into the same areas as citizens unless they do so illegally?gtWhen Israel helps settlers take Palestinian landYou mean buy that land? Which is what most of them do? Yeah Im so sorry Jews are buying land from Palestinians!gt and establish illegal settlements thereJust as Palestinians do when building illegally in Area C. But no ones on their case about that. If building homes in disputed territory  apartheid then India Pakistan Turkey China and even democratic states besides India are all...apartheid states. That cheapens the word because it doesnt apply.gt then uses force to prevent the retaking of that land Why shouldnt Israel defend the land of citizens who own it legally and paid fair value for it?gtit is practicing apartheid. It is the very definition of apartheid.Even if everything you just said was true the apartheid label still wouldnt apply. Because apartheid is racial discrimination. Palestinians in the West Bank are the same race as Palestinian citizens of Israel. The only difference is citizenship of a state. There is no racial discrimination there is citizenship differentiation. Do you see that as apartheid? If so then every country in the world is an apartheid state.Thats where your logic works.gtHow is the colonization of land not belonging to Israel justifiable?The land belongs to neither side. It is disputed. Even the international community cannot determine nor have they tried the border between the two states. When admitting Palestine as a nonmember observer state to the UN they said that the border should be based on the  lines which does not define the border. That means the territory is disputed.Israelis buying land in that territory legally should be able to move there. And why not? They legally own it.

However when they throw threats of the destruction of Israel around as easily as they transfer funds to Hezbollah which actively attacks Israel  then its a worrying development to Israel.

5853915,0,t3_3vejpw,I was directed to this thread by our illustrious moderator uGreenApe and I can definitely relate to what you are going through. I also think I can give you realistic advice that will help you cope with a situation you clearly did not choose for yourself.When I was  my family moved back to Israel after spending virtually all of my life abroad aside from two years as a toddler in Israel but whatever. Id lived nearly a decade in the US where things were great and after that had moved to East Asia for a few years thanks to my dads job. I remember that first transition from the US to Asia being something I was extremely unhappy about when I found out it was going to happen. I was  enjoying late s life in Clintons America Bill not Hillary and about to enter puberty. But I was also a realist. I knew I had no say in the matter much how like you did not have any say in the matter when your family made aliyah three years ago.So I went with it. Turns out I was lucky because being put into an international school system made the transition relatively easy. I made great friends. Had the most fun Ive ever had in my life including  years since.And then we moved back to Israel. IT. FUCKING. SUCKED. The school was shit teachers would go on strike every other week they wanted to hold me back a grade level because my Hebrew wasnt good enough and the infrastructure of the country at that point made doing ANYTHING on my own next to impossible. Back then we had to take an hour long bus ride to Tel Aviv just to watch a fucking movie. And my dad had to drive me to the bus stop.I became a recluse. My only solace was this wonderful thing called the internet. It helped pass the time until I lucked out and my family left Israel again right before I turned . I vowed never to return to this godforsaken shithole.And yet here I am  years later back in the very place I made that vow. Why you ask? Because I was a minor then and am an adult now. Im now barely in contact with any of the people I knew when I was your age. Despite how this sounds Im not trying to sound like a condescending adult telling you that you shouldnt complain because youre still a kid. In contrast Im telling you that your complaints while valid now will disappear as soon as you become legally independent. You have nothing to worry about in the long run as long as you proactively approach your life and take advantage of every little opportunity or lack thereof thrown at you. School is shit? Learn stuff from home like programming or mathematics or filmmaking! Food is shit? Learn to cook! The ingredients here are the same as anywhere else. Also when I was your age I didnt care much for the food either. But tastes change! Mine did! Shits too expensive? Look at it as an opportunity to value what you think you want vs. what you actually need. This lesson will pay off later in life trust me. Dont want to do the army? Unfortunately you dont have much choice here......but USE the opportunity to do something worthwhile. Approach life with the following mentality If I have to do it Im going to do it best. Apply for gibushim and sayeret tryouts. Be a fucking badass not because you want to but because you can! Start walking around like youre Gods gift to this fucking country because thats the only way to make things better. Israel is not going to change for you thats an unfortunate fact. The best advice I can give is to make lemonade with these lemons life has given you. All you have is time so why not do what you can until that time is over? Because the one thing you may be forgetting which you should be happy aboutYou are American.You can go back in  years. You can go back in . You can go wherever you want except some Muslim countries and do whatever you want legally once you reach your early s. The world will be your oyster and you will be able to enjoy it more if you take advantage of what you cannot control now instead of just letting it beat you to a pulp.In essence Make Israel your bitch.,Israel,cxmz5rg,19,t5_2qhvo

Israelis are far more ready than before for another Operation Defensive Shield to root out terrorists anywhere and at any time than they were last summer. Last summer the engagement was purposely limited and staggered so ground fighting didnt start until a decent way in because of the uncertainty over support. There was almost no support for attacking and destroying Hamas government via a ground operation even while fighting went on.This time it would be a little different.

6044308,0,t1_cybvq9d,gt You are under the impression that Zionist leaders genuinely want peace and a solution to the conflict. I am sorry to break it to you that...that is not true either. They also benefit from the status quo where they keep annexing more and more land.I do not agree with settlements in the aspect they make a  state solution less feasible. However I think though you can make a case that the land is disputed settlements like Gush Ezion the land was purchased over a century ago or the fact there has been a continuous Jewish presence in East JerusalemHebron. New settlements have not been built in a very long time  usually what you read in the news is new housing developments in East Jerusalem for Jews and also for Arabs. As for Oslo  maybe it was a mistake...before Oslo Jews would go to the WB and Palestinians would go to Israel. That was the case with Gaza too  Jews would go to Gaza and vice versa. I remember reading a book and the journalist asked the Jews in Hebron why they never go to the Palestinian side anymore and their response was Peace happened referring to Oslo. ,Israel,cybx021,8,t5_2qhvo

Barak initially said Jerusalem would be undivided. He changed that Olmert initially said it in  too and he came up with an innovative way of keeping that promise. Netanyahu said it all the time then there were murmurings he was ready to accept a division in principle then there was evidence that his confidant agreed to a division then there were indications that Netanyahu accepted a framework of basing a deal on  lines,Israel,cye8fmx,5,t5_2qhvo

In any case I know someone who works in the office in charge of academic officers so if you get stuck shoot me a P.M.  gtSo some academicofficers wind up as normal officers if they go through officer training school while others dont go through it and stay on a seperate academicofficer track or Im misunderstanding?  You got that right. The IDF has a policy to encourage as many academic officers as possible to go through Officer Training School since it opens up a lot of new job placement options for them and enlarges the armys pool of fully commissioned officers of course. I suspect its not as much of an issue to you but academic officers who wish to pursue a career in the IDF need to go through Officer Training School since theres no advancement beyond Senior Academic Officer which severely limits their job options and the army generally prefers not to keep people who have no advancement routes for officers the cutoff is usually between Captain and Major so it would make sense that it would be equivalent for Senior Academic Officers who are equivalent to Captains.

The proper way of it would be If thousands of people with the USs approval as sovereign of the territory moved to Ohio in the hopes of someday having the governor of Ohio be a Somalian. Yes Id be OK with that.gtYou can say they didnt initially seek to establish a state of their own but reading about what the first socialist secular zionists and the minority religious zionists said like Bentwich etc it was implicit they wanted to move enough jews into the area to become a majority and then create a jewish state.They wanted to have Jewish leaders within existing administrative boundaries. So like Mexican immigrants hoped to someday have Mexican leaders in California who still govern with the consent of the majority but also are keen towards looking at the interests of the Mexican demographic of the state.I dont see how that isnt arguable. Do we believe that its OK to bar immigrants because they might someday form the majority of a countrys population and thus lead it? That logic would make the US quite interesting considering Irish immigration and subsequent control of the USs various parts at some time or another. Jews like Irish immigrants wanted a safe place. They also unlike Irish immigrants wanted to go to a land they had a connection to already. Like Irish immigrants they sought to be able to determine the direction of their lives by leading the areas they were in if not in that generation then in a future one.Why are all of these bad things? I dont think they are. Why would it be bad to become the majority within an existing administration and subsequently lead said administration? What is inherently wrong with that?

But since the wold is still working over the prospect of a Palestinian state they are not entitled to.Same thing happened with India and Pakistan. The descendants of Muslim refugees from India into Pakistan amp the descendants of nonMuslim refugees from Pakistan into India are not entitled to return to India or Pakistan respectively. They and their diaspora descendants can return to their respective states.gtaccording to partition planAre you suggesting that we should go back to ?gti dont see how its relevant to israel the refugee issue is not related to immigration policy its an obligation to people who fled war or were expelled forcefully.Its why Jews can automatically become citizens in the Jewish nation state. Its entirely relevant to the question.gteveryone has the same rights every person on earth has the right to leave and to return to their country of origin and so do palestinians. the working for the creation for palesitnian state doesnt interfere with israeli obligations towards refugees so i dont see what does it have to do with anything in this discussion.gtgtEveryone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State. Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own and to return to his country.Note that the text is not their country of origin.

Does that make their cause  times as morally just? Is it even a factor  does that make their cause  times more just in some certain sense because they are victims?No it naturally does not. You of course will counter with but the Palestinians... and thats all well and good but casualties are not any sort of indication for who you should support in a war. If you want to argue other points as you have than thats of course fine.gt the problem is that Israel is not doing their best to solve the conflict in their position of almost absolute power.The way Israelis see it this position of absolute power is fragile transient hardearned and highly dependent on the very Israeli policy that you decry. Israel has managed to take almost absolute control of its own destiny because of its refusal to give an inch to the Palestinians who will gladly take a mile. You think that just because Israel appears to be so powerful and in control right now it can make whatever concessions it fancies remove fences and dismantle checkpoints and uproot Israeli houses and so forth and so on  and the iron fist of Israeli power will somehow magically keep everything together and prevent a downward spiral that might end with a replay of  andor .

I agree that Jewish Americans or pro israel shouldnt vote on that one thing alone but it is remarkable how often during the debates they said Israel a tiny little middle eastern country.

This was the claimgtThe new generation within the rightwing parties was determined not only to govern as they have almost uninterrupted since  but also to change the nature of the states institutions according to their political perceptions.For one all people change institutions to suit their politics. That includes the left. I love how onesided this is.For another  years since  have had rightwing leaders.  have have leftwing leaders. Sure the right has had more leadership time than the left. But almost uninterrupted? The right has been interrupted  times between their  stints. Thats a pretty normal turnover for many countries.Uninterrupted is what the left had for over  years of no change.gtThe outbreak of the violent events in the West Bank and Jerusalem at the end of last year heightened tensions already inflamed between the new emergent rightwing elite and the army.I love the downplaying of terrorist attacks as violent events. Avoiding giving responsibility to Palestinians via the usual bigotry of low expectations.gtThis policy proved efficient as it probably helped prevent clashes from spreading to larger sections of the Palestinian society but it remained highly unpopular among rightwing circles who expected the army to shoot to kill whenever a Palestinian dared to attack or confront Israeli soldiers or civilians in the West Bank and elsewhere More straw man arguments. Is this a journalist writing or someone who views the world through a prism of insane bias?gtThe turning point occurred in Hebron where an Israeli soldier Elor Azaria shot and killed Abdel Fattah alSharif a wounded Palestinian laying in the street who had allegedly tried to stab a soldier in the occupied city.Amazing how the Palestinian allegedly tried to stab a soldier in Israels capital but Elor Azaria definitely shot him and it was definitely unjustified. He never even considers the arguments of Azaria which were that he believed that he had a suicide vest and had moved.gtFor the right wing and even for Netanyahu this was the proof they needed that the army instead of fighting the enemy had become too political wading into the business of giving moral lessons to Israeli society.This is the case in any fucking country in the world. No democracy allows the military to dictate political beliefs or it would be coming dangerously close to interfering with democracy.

8460432,0,t3_4vjgjb,I know nothing about Israels public health system but I can give you my experience as an American whose body decided to shut down the first day of a Birthright trip. My tour leader drove me to an emergency clinic in a small town in the north cant remember the name.. They offered free tea and cake which was a real cultural difference. Couldnt eat it . Another cultural difference was how open the emergency clinic was. There were dividing curtains but I could make direct eye contact with the other patients.. Didnt have to turn over any insurance...I think just my passport or drivers license. The receptionist kept asking my tour guide who translated if all Americans have middle names. She was fascinated by it.. I kept asking for Tylenol...then referred to it as acetaminophen. Nobody knew what I was talking about until someone said paracetamol. There was a language barrier. My doctor spoke Arabic and Hebrew and a small amount of English and my tour guide spoke Hebrew and English so almost everything I said had to be translated.. Ginger ale does not seem to exist in Israel. I remember making a journey around the medical center and trying not to pass out just to get a Sprite.. I didnt have to pay anything for my visit to the clinic  hours. Not sure if it was covered by Birthright or if they just dont charge at all that is its paid for by taxes.Israels healthcare system has a great reputation. They couldnt really do anything for my case because it was a virus but the quality of care was good and Id even say it was more human than an emergency room in the U.S.  I dont know if this can be generalized to Israel as a whole but it may be interesting to those whod like to compare emergency treatment between the two countries.,Israel,d5z38aj,1,t5_2qhvo

Netanyahu refused these talks and instead demands the universally condemned and unprecedented right to be allowed to take Palestinian land during the talks.He doesnt want to leave the end result of the talks to chance. He wants to make sure that whatever happens Israel will get as much land as it wants. If the Palestinians are stubborn on giving a certain piece of land to Israel Netanyahu wants to be assured that he can take it using violence during the talks all the same. And he wants the Palestinians to agree to agree that Israel can use that violence against them during the talks. This is truly insane. The Palestinians have been gullible enough to agree to this many times in the past and all it got them was  settlers. Now they realize what is happening to them and they arent falling for it this time. If at any point Netanyahu is serious about peace he will pause settlement expansion and agree to talks. ,Israel,d6d5wz7,-6,t5_2qhvo

And I know that you realize that so Im not sure what youre trying to prove by nitpicking here.As for Jordan not wanting to use obsolete biblical terms that would only legitimize Israels territorial claims  sure. But please explain why on earth does Jordan gets to define the name? All it did is illegally annex the land for  years half a century ago and its claim to the land is recognized by no country in the world including Jordan itself. Why on earth should I see that term as neutral?I mean I get that there are complex historical reasons to why this term became more popular and that this weird quirk of history is probably here to stay.

9027438,0,t3_53wvhx,Full articleNew York  U.S. President Barack Obama told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday that continued construction at the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is threatening the future of the twostate solution.According to a senior American official in their halfhour long meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly Obama raised profound U.S. concerns about the corrosive effect that that settlement activity that is continuing when the occupation enters its th year is having on the prospects of two states solution.The official added that Netanyahu pushed back on this. Theyve never papered over their differences he said.The meeting between Obama and Netanyahu took place only a few days after the two nations signed a new year military aid deal. The meeting will most likely be the last between the two leaders before Obama leaves the White House in January.A senior Israeli official who is familiar with the details of the conversation between the two told journalists at a briefing that the disagreement about the settlement issue came up but was not the main topic of discussion. The senior official who described the meeting as positive noting that it lasted for an hour and a quarter and not the halfhour claimed by U.S. officials said Netanyahu told Obama that the settlements are not the root of the conflict today and were not the root of the conflict when Israel left Gaza.Netanyahu and Obama had two main disagreements through the years  Iran and the question of what was blocking an agreement with the Palestinians the senior official said. With all due respect to the settlements they are not the problem. The problem is the stubborn refusal of the Palestinian leadership to yield on the right of return and to recognize the Jewish state within any borders.The senior official noted that Netanyahu did not raise the possibility that Obama might make a move in the UN Security Council on the IsraeliPalestinian issue during the period between the American elections in November and the end of his term on January .The issue didnt come up and they didnt talk about it the senior official said. Theres an elephant in the room. Netanyahu knows theres an elephant and Obama knows theres an elephant and both know that the other knows that theres an elephant in the room.During the meeting Netanyahu discussed his belief that its possible to leverage the developing ties between Israel and the Arab world to advance the peace process with the Palestinians. Netanyahu told Obama that he sees this as creating different options than existed in the past the senior official said. Until now there had never been such a clear Arab interest in reaching understandings and cooperating with Israel.At the outset of the meeting Obama told reporters that he will be interested in hearing Netanyahus assessment about the conditions in Israel and the West Bank. There is great danger of terrorism and flair ups of violence and we also have concerns about settlement activity. We want to see how Israel sees the next few years... because we want to make sure that we keep alive this possibility of a stable secure Israel at peace with its neighbors and a Palestinian homeland that meets the aspirations of the Palestinian people said Obama.Obamas comments reflected the view of the American administration that the twostate solution is in real danger of becoming irrelevant in the near future mostly because of the construction in the settlements and the diplomatic freeze between Israel and the Palestinians. The Americans think the situation on the West Bank and the present trends are leading to a reality of a single binational state.The U.S. administration has been holding discussions over the past few months about the possibility of advancing a move in the UN Security Council on the IsraelPalestinian issue after the U.S. presidential elections in November and before Obama leaves office. Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes said in a press briefing before the meeting that he does not rule out the possibility that Obama will decide to carry out such a step before the end of his term but Rhodes made it clear that for now he has no such plan. At the outset of the meeting Netanyahu remarked in general about the Palestinian issue and said The greatest opportunity is to advance peace and this is something that I and the people of Israel will never give up on. The meeting took place in the Lotte New York Palace Hotel where Obama is staying during the UN General Assembly session. Netanyahu praised Obama and thanked him for the military aid agreement according to which Israel will receive  billion over  years for purchasing military equipment in the United States.  The military aid deal fortifies Israels security and makes sure it can defend itself by itself against any threat. Israel has no better friend than the U.S. and the U.S. has no better friend than Israel. It is an unbreakable bond based on common values and interests said Netanyahu. Obama too spoke about the military aid agreement It is important for Americas national security that we have a safe and secure Israel that can defend itself. The aid deal provides assurance that the cooperation between us will continue and it allows Israeli planners the kind of certainty at a moment of very little certainty in the region. We want Israel to have all the capabilities it needs he said. Netanyahu also remarked on the day after Obama leaves the White House and told him that even after he completes his term in office he will remain an influential person whose voice will be listened to for decades I know you will continue to support Israels right to defend itself and to live as a Jewish state.

9427825,1,t3_59sor4,Full articleAgriculture Minister Uri Ariel on Thursday slammed a secret approval by the security cabinet to authorize construction plans for Palestinians in the West Bank. Ariel of the hardright partyHabayit Hayehudi demanded a review of the plans by the full cabinet at its next weekly session Sunday.This is a miserable reality in which the settlers get sticks and the carrots go to the Palestinians. We never expected this Ariel said.The security cabinet voting secretly in midSeptember authorized a proposal drawn up by the Civil Administration on Defense Minister Avigdor Liebermans behalf to approve Palestinian construction in West Bank Area C where all the Jewish settlements in the territory are built.I demand this be debated by the cabinet. Such a decision should be taken by the entire cabinet not a secret cabinet that tries to hide it from other cabinet members he added. I hope it will be raised at the next meeting this Sunday and of course we will seek to thwart the idea raised by the security cabinet.The decision by Israel to permit Palestinian construction in Area Cis the first of its kind in years. Though the plan was not deemed to be sensitive for diplomatic or security reasons it was kept secret with not a single detail leaked to the press. A senior Israeli official said the reason was because the decision was seen as politically sensitive.According to the official settler leaders hold sway in the Likud and there are strong objections to Palestinian construction in Area C in the Habayit Hayehudi party. Objections to the issue have grown only stronger with settlers pressing the government to avert a courtordered demolition by years end of the illegal outpost of Amona.The proposal was initiated and put to a cabinet vote by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman as part of his socalled carrots and sticks policy to encourage moderate Palestinians a plan he presented to Israeli media in August.In defense of his proposal Lieberman has said that the programs goal is to do good by those prepared to live in coexistence with us and on the other hand make things harder for those planning terror attacks.Lawmaker Tzipi Livni Zionist Union applauded the decision but criticized the government for having kept it a secret. The security cabinets decision is correct and a long time coming. It contributes to security. If it would have been done in the open we could also have advanced our interests with countries in the region and the wider world. The secrecy is out of fear of farright leader Naftali Bennett and thats our loss.,Israel,d9b1iht,0,t5_2qhvo

You turn Israels expansionism and suppression of Palestinian rights into a series of twisted legal loopholes. gt The front put up for the international community is the Palestinian front of supporting two states.

You have to get a bill of health similar to the one they require you to get in order to get a drivers license from a physician.   You have to train with the gun in a range until youre declared capable.   You have to answer one of the following criteria  most of them mean you get  handgun and  bullets living or working in an eligible community mostly settlements be a certified active tour guide be a farmer with a certificate from a certain official saying that you need a gun work in explosives transportation be a certain sort of officerNCO be a lieutenant colonel of the army an equivalent rank of the other security services or a police officer for at least two years be a certain kind of security guard in the airport or as part of the Shin Bet be a security officer be a firefighter have a particular recommendation from the police inherit a weapon in which case it mustnt be used and you wont get any ammo be a firing range guide be a professional sportsman have a hunting license or have certain veterinarian needs.Assuming you got a permit its for a limited time and you must renew it and pay the Ministry of Public Security every time you do so and of course youre responsible for the weapon youve bought.I think this is a good system  it means that people that need guns can get them while other people dont.

Any land it leases can be swapped in exchange for land from the ILA.gtThe Knesset also passes legislation allowing nongovernmental organisations the legal right to refuse Arabs property also most notably the JNFSee above.gtThe legal system also discriminates against Arabs in terms of absentee rights where property reclamation in Jerusalem is concernedNo it does not. The laws there are not delineated by ethnic grouping at all and most Jerusalem Palestinians are not citizens despite having the ability to become citizens. Were talking about the rights of citizens and they voluntarily choose to not get those rights because they view it as normalization.gtThis is without getting in to the extensive research done in to the government administered education system whose policies are also the result of the Israel states legislative branch. Again these reports are easy to find by anyone who cares to look for them. This has nothing to do with rights unless you insist that every country in the world has different rights for different groups. There is no education system worldwide that works equally for all groups.gtI didnt build a strawman nor did I change the subject. How asking you to state directly what you think on the issue being discussed is changing the subject is a mystery to meYou absolutely built a straw man asserting I said that nothing Israel does is illegal or at least parodying me as if I was saying that.I did state directly what I thought.Heres what I saidgtThere are plenty of Palestinians who have the same in Israel.

10394971,0,t3_5ov7b6,Full articleThe Israel Police hastened to publish their version of the events in the Bedouin town of Umm alHiran Wednesday morning according to which a civilian was shot to death after deliberately crashing his car into a group of police officers killing one and injuring another. But growing evidence including video from a police helicopter and statements from eyewitnesses and relatives of the alleged attacker cast doubt on the certainty voiced by the police.The police video seems to show officers shooting at Yakub Abu alKiyan as he drove his car slowly before the vehicle accelerated and hit the group of police personnel killing Sgt. Maj. Erez Levi.A police spokeswoman Commander Merav Lapidot said that Wednesdays events began with a car ramming attack after which clashes erupted between local residents and police officers dispatched to the scene. Lapidot adhered to this version in numerous interviews during the day.The car barreled into the police troops to carry out a terror attack she said noting the terrorist is an Islamic Movement activist.A few hours after the incident police officials began claiming that Abu alKiyan had ties to the Islamic State movement. As proof they showed images taken in his home of copies of the Hebrew daily Yisrael Hayom with frontpage headlines reporting a carramming attack in Hebron and sabotage by the Islamic State of a Russian airplane.Everyone knows the terrorist was a teacher in a school six of whose teachers who chose to teach Islamic State ideology have already been arrested Police Commissioner Roni Alsheikh said.Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan on Wednesday accused Arab Knesset members of whipping up antiIsrael sentiment among Bedouin. Senior police officers meanwhile held covert talks with Bedouin community leaders in a bid to promote calm.This blood is also on your hands Erdan wrote on Facebook addressing MKs from the mainly Arab Joint List.I hope this day wont mark a turning point in Bedouin relations with the state authorities but if it does MK Ayman Odeh has made a considerable contribution to it Erdan said in one press release. In three subsequent statements Erdan reiterated his claim of Joint List MKs responsibility for the events and called for Odeh the party chairman to be investigated on suspicion of incitement violence and obstructing the duties of police officers.,Israel,dcmc4fq,1,t5_2qhvo

Mexicos lunatic dictators started two wars with us we burned them to the dirt twice we felt sorry for them anyway and paid them a bunch of money twice they signed away the land in a treaty and got a lot more money then they blew all the money on palaces and stupid crap they didnt need from the Germans and French who temporarily ruled Mexico and taught them European kleptocracy.  Besides the Viceroyalty of New Spain was only in the territory now occupied by the USA for maybe twenty years.  That whole charming period of California ranchos of Zorro fame was a very brief moment in time.  They tried to make Catholic missions here and the native Indians basically told them to go screw themselves.  Only some place names survive.  The Mexican californios who stayed here after Guadalupe Hidalgo happily became Americans when they were allowed to keep thousands of square acres of prime ranchland.  Those families still exist in California and they are monstrously rich and dont look a bit Hispanic.  Go tour the California wine country sometime and youll see.The history of Mexicos continuous revolutionary system of government is so comically screwed up that theyre the only nation on Earth with two independence days.  Think about that for a moment.  Today most of Mexicos most successful people now have names like Todd Martinez and Glenda Sanchez and they live in Los Angeles and Phoenix and Las Vegas and havent been Mexican citizens for four or five generations.  Theyre firefighters schoolteachers real estate agents scholarly academics forest rangers musicians racquetball instructors and department store cosmetic counter clerks.  Among many other things.

Back then there was no border and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza had essentially status of permanent residents. Israelis made holidays to Gaza and visited West Bank freely. My motherinlaw for example took a taxi and went alone to Hebron in the s to visit the Cave of the Patriarchs. These times are long gone.Another thing to note is that annexation of West Bank would either Israel to become an apartheid state if reasonable path to citizenship would not be provided. This would mean strong outrage from the rest of the world with sanctions. If Israel would give reasonable path for Palestinians to become Israeli citizens then it would be just a matter of time before Jews would become minority.The best way to end the status quo is to do strategic withdrawal with partial annexation and set up of two states for two peoples.,Israel,ddfubbc,5,t5_2qhvo

First off the salaries in Israel are terrible and that more than anything I can find is the primary reason people leave. And I doubt theyll come back. You get used to living in America. You begin to accept that everything you want can be delivered to you in less than two hours. You ensure your kids have names that sound American and you convince yourself that their English is a critical business skill for the future  and youre right. But youre not comfortable. Something is missing. Theres a goyishness that creeps in and begins to make you homesick. You miss your family even if they drove you crazy while you lived near them. And you dont like that your kids know Christmas songs even though youre not religious. You wind up in a Chabad house with a handful of other nonreligious Israelis and you give each other support in the new world. Eventually you or your spouse wants to go home and it creates tension in the marriage. Theres a lot of misery and a very real sense that Israel is where you belong but youre driving a  Audi on ridiculously low monthly lease payments and your house has  acre of land. Yeah its a trap but Jews have been scattered all over the world for generations for a reason  typically to find a better life. For those who want to leave but cant be grateful. For those who left but want to come home it aint easy. For those who left and wouldnt dream of returning I lived in America for a long time. Never say never. ,Israel,ddgsn0a,6,t5_2qhvo

10882519,0,t1_de29z3g,gtWhat doesnt set borders is conquest. When Israel was recognized its sovereign territory extended only to the Green Line. Anything else seized unilaterally by force cant be recognized as Israeli territory. UNSCR  allowed for negotiations between the parties to define the definitive border but never unilateral annexation.Again recognition and UNSCR  cannot set borders. Israel didnt unilaterally annex anything. It just acknowledged the land is not all Palestinian or Arab because Israel was entitled to keep some.gtI mean the Polish and Russian and German and Hungarian immigrants that arrived en masse to Palestine against the will of the native population and with the permission of the colonial rulers.You mean the native Jews genetically native to the area kept out for centuries by the native racists.gtThey are a handful of vocally proIsrael scholars that hold a fringe and bizarre opinion on the legality of settlements. AFAIK they dont even dispute that the West Bank is under belligerent occupation as OP implies.You clearly dont know who they are some of them dont hold anything theyre dead.They are and were experts in international law.gtBinding or not it is still the most authoritative opinion possible in any interpretation of International Law. If the ICJ interprets that the OPT are indeed occupied that the FGC applies and that settlements are a violation of the FGC no other opinion is going to have more weight than it even if it cant force the involved parties to comply.The court was not briefed on the FGC and its application to settlements in the West Bank not the fictional OPT so its opinion there hold no weight because it was not arrived at by using the proper procedures as its own Charter states.gtThe HCP declared the Convention they signed does indeed apply in the OPT and that settlements are a violation of it. Same with the IRC under whose aegis the Conventions were drafted. Same with the SC all of whose resolutions all UN members are under the obligation to accept and carry out as per the UN Charter.It cant apply in an OPT that doesnt exist. It doesnt apply in the West Bank to settlements and the HCP have no right to make that declaration either. You cant politically reinterpret a treaty to discriminate against Israel. The ICRC likewise has no power to decide borders or these things or the SC.The UN Charter makes clear Chapter VI resolutions arent obligatory. You clearly havent read the Charter.gtWherever the borders may eventually lay the OPT will remain occupied territory subject to the Geneva Conventions and where the occupied power cant settle its own civilian population.The West BankJudea and Samaria can have settlements. This is fact unless you want to discriminate against the one Jewish state in the world on this point of law.gtIsrael has not annexed it. Israel has not even formally claimed it. Israel cant possibly have it unilaterally. Palestinians on the other hand do claim it and as the occupied population do have a right to do so. Seems clear cut. The UNSC has certainly seen it that way.I didnt claim it had it unilaterally. The occupied population claiming it doesnt mean anything. Israel claims some of the land must be its own which is all thats necessary.The fact that you like bodies discriminating against Israel and going against  years of history is notable.The fact that you keep relying on an appeal to authority from bodies whose opinions can and have changed and will continue to change is also notable.Stick to appeals to authority.

Its located in central Tel Aviv so you may be around anyway just jump in and try to find a specific store.Advanced players should check out Tel Avivs Central Bus Station The worlds nd biggest CBS which is extremely surprising since Tel Aviv is TINY compared to worldwide metros. It is truly a maze Floor  supposedly contains preparations for an underground metro never built but for the last decades is home to several species of bats where scientific studies of them are taking place. The two floor above are notsotemporal residences or notsohomelessanymore people. And somewhere above that are a boutique movie theatre a Yiddish book shop and Israels greatest techno nightclub The Block. Regular tours are being held there I highly suggest you join one. Even if only Hebrew ones available when youre here theyre much better than going alone and somebody would be happy to translate for you for sure. Heres a pointer but other tours are available as well.. If youre more interested in s architecture Tel Aviv is also filled with Bauhausstyle buildings. Its a unique style developed originally in Germany but actually survived to its fullest right here since many buildings were bombed over there in WWII while JewishGerman architects immigrated and used this style here. I think Tel Avivs municipality offers free tours about it.,Israel,de9xvkq,1,t5_2qhvo

Steam will be easy.PS sounds like it will be harder but I can probably do the same thing if I bring it over with my NA account and buy over the NA site with codes.

11273059,0,t1_df9q181,Youre proving my entire point. Im staying that they are acting as MUSLIMS which you agree with. Since theyre acting as MUSLIMS in the conflict then the conflict turns religious at least for them. The Crusades were religious because the Christians wanted to take back the Holy Land. They invoked the name of  God and Jesus which made it religious conflict. Jihad is used by the Palestinians. They direct jihad and intifadas against the Israelis. Historically it may be like that but that is not the present. Give me proof that the Palestinians did not declare jihad against the Israelis and Jews. You have proven my point so many times. If this was a land struggle they would act as Arabs not Muslims,Israel,df9s9gm,1,t5_2qhvo
11286893,1,t1_dfb9n4a,Its the boy who cried wolf thing. According to the FBI us Jewish folks file the most complaints but actually have the lowest turn out of charges being brought. African Americans have the highest  amount of hate crime convictions of people harassing them. I also read a report in the Princeton review that says certain groups are more likely to think something is attacking them when its the normal way every day assholes behave. There finding was certain Jewish zealots feel if they dont get an advantage they complain and fell discriminated against.The problem is all of this clouds real prejudice and issues we need to handle.

And we have no way of knowing in which order their loyalties lie.We recently saw how neocons mostly Jewish stovepiped false information up to George Bush saying that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Judith Miller hyped it up in the New York Times. It was all lies from beginning to end. Were supposed to believe the fact that it served the interests of Israel had nothing to do with it. Americans lost their lives for that lie.QuoteMiller was later involved in the Plame Affair in which the status of Valerie Plame as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA became widely known. When asked to name her sources Miller invoked reporters privilege and refused to reveal her sources in the Central Intelligence Agency leak and spent  days in jail protecting her source Scooter Libby.WikipediaQuoteIn October  Libby was indicted by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. Plames position at the CIA was considered classified information. Libby was indicted on five counts relating to the Plame affair Two counts of perjury two counts of making false statements to federal investigators and one count of obstruction of justice.WikipediaThis is all now a matter of public record.,Israel,dfi3wzi,-2,t5_2qhvo

Government will try to fight this phenomenon with tax reliefs for businesses that hire immigrants this helps but not to an extent that makes Olim feel welcomed at job interviews. The tragedy of the  year old person who tries to learn a totally alien language is a never ending one most will never reach the same level of fluency and intelligibility as native speakers and forever be second choice candidates unless they have some unique skills which are hard to obtain among the locals.
