Just as long as you can push a pencil around or paintbrush or whatever you can find and think of creative ways to lay out letterforms that is the gist of it. Once you get comfortable with a layout of the words you want to draw experiment with different character styles throughout the piece. Bold condensed script etc. ,Lettering,cg0dzyp,2,t5_2type

2429701,0,t1_cm9j4my,Hard to say from the photo. Im guessing it belonged to a sign painter who did more pictorial work than lettering as most of the brushes have metal vs. quill ferrules there are some regular artist brushes in there also and also because of the tubes of oil paint which a strictly lettering guy would not have. Nice assortment of pinstripe brushes also. ,Lettering,cmc0npp,2,t5_2type

3620628,0,t1_cq4yj81,It is a good tool because it allows you to get a result quickly. Great for mockup. It will also teach you some bad habits re how much oressure to apply and other brush skills. The major disadvantage Id that cleaning up more intricate letterings done with a tablet will require greater effort. You dont really have any control over the points or anchors while youre painting with a tablet and itll never be as clean looking. p.s. going through your comment history I really like your work,Lettering,cq4z8go,1,t5_2type

7736390,0,t3_4l9w02,Theres the real way and the Photoshop way. The image you linked to is Photoshop. The real way paint very carefully or mask your letters with tape very carefully then paint a bit less carefully.The Photoshop way you need to mask your painted image with the shape of your lettering. You can do this in different ways heres oneOpen your lettering in PS add the texture on top and hide the layer duplicate the lettering layer CtrlL levels. While holding Alt drag the right slider to the left until the paper is all white click OK.Select  Color range click the black of the lettering adjust fuzziness to your liking.Now unhide the texture you want and click the mask icon to mask it with the selection you made of your lettering.Hide the lettering layer on which you changed the levels and you should have your texture on top of your original lettering image.You can also go even simpler texture image on bottom lettering image on top set the layer blending mode to screen. But unless your paper is  white you will see the texture on the paper as well.,Lettering,d3lklf5,7,t5_2type
