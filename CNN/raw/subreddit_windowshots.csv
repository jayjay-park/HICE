232698,0,t1_cf4kb2y,The person who founded this subReddit has been busy with a much larger sub. So for a while this sub hasnt been moderated much at all. Which is why you see so many offtopic posts.   I have been unofficially pointing out posts which are not ontopic for a few months now. And most people dont like to be told that they are posting in error. Its just a thing people take it way too personally. I spoke to the mods and asked them if they wanted me to bug out or if I was actually doing the right thing. I was invited to help them mod this subReddit. It was decided that things needed tightening up.  This post is neither your home nor your place of work. A glimpse in to your everyday life is what is meant.   If your Grandma had posted it in HER account it would probably be OK depending on how long she spent in the room  D,windowshots,cf4v99c,1,t5_2qq8r
