4197504,0,t1_cryi0t3,Apparently having a queer character in a queer setting for a few episodes of a show but also has several other plotlines unrelated to gender or sexuality is pushing the gay agenda. Its actually pushing an era of excellent complex diverse television.,Sense8,crypm7p,7,t5_2wqui
4197869,0,t3_38n0h8,Im wondering what is meant by all the births except for Nomis not occurring in a hospital? I know its not necessary or as common in other parts of the world to give birth in a hospital. Also Nomis birth was the only nonvaginal one with her born by csection. Is the csection an indication of her mothers lack of emotional connection to her child? I know there are many reasons why people have csections but this birth was obviously intentionally performed that way and for what reason?,Sense8,cryr3sn,30,t5_2wqui

Riley runs Kala prays Will looks for a way to save everyone Nomi analyzes poor sweet dumb Lito emotionally agonizes over it etc. The only two Senses that seem to fight and kill as an immediate first response without remorse are Sun and Wolfgang. I think that does make them sort of monsters compared to others carved out of violence.

The idea of what theyre all experiencing.  Maybe one of the best TV moments I can remember.gtI had wondered why they werent all hackers now  Will knew that Nomi copied the hard drive but he didnt know the contents of the drive  so information transfer is only partial.There was another line in the show how you dont visit they let you in.  And we see Van Damme fight then forget how to fight then fight again.  So the informationknowledge is temporary and has to be asked for?  Or is only available when the person is letting them use it?

4424462,0,t3_3bolsf,This is both the blessing and curse of the netflix format  first of all no commercials which means no artificiallyinduced act breaks exactly every x minutes and no length requirement. Traditional hourlongs are these days  minutes or so to allow for  minutes of commercials.On Netflix and HBO and Showtime etc theres literally zero reason to limit episode length aside from well the episode has to end eventually. This can be bad too I think a lot of the criticism with the th Arrested Development season and Community season  on Yahoo to a lesser extent was about how absent those firm constraints the writers could extend things out a bit too far in some cases.All in all though movies have been selflimiting for ages and I think its good that television is getting that same opportunity to explore the story for as long as is necessary to make it good.,Sense8,csoeaag,1,t5_2wqui

7136278,0,t3_4dayt9,Obviously no one is going to get you to change your mind and if the show isnt to your liking it isnt to your liking but I just want to play devils advocate here for a minute because some of how you are wording things is really offensive. It isnt proselytizing or an attempt to convert you to depict gay sex or gay pride in a gay couples life on a TV show no more so than it has been every single time a gay person has watched the hundreds of thousands of hetero sex scenes in movies and TV shows before. And thats the real thing here  that hetero sex scenes have been done millions of times in film  some quite graphically. This show depicts people in their normal lives doing what normal people do  in the case of Nomi and Lito  have sex with their partners. Now suddenly close minded people are coming out of the woodwork screaming how the W siblings are trying to convert people to gaydom and pushing gay agendas. No thats ignorant bullshit and you should know that deep down. They are simply showing what life is like for a large percentage of the population that has been neglectedridiculedpersecuted in media for a long time.,Sense8,d1pber4,22,t5_2wqui
7154146,0,t1_d1qlf6g,I think that you may be confusing proselytizing with presenting a narrative. Everything youve listed is part of an attempt to challenge viewers assumptions about the show.As for your list Ill address them individually The show is about people from all across the world including a gay man. The men kissing set up gay men as something unremarkable as much a part of the world as the rest of images revealed in the opening. The dildo scene. Honestly I believe that this was put into the show to shock viewers. Dildos are taboo even though theres nothing intrinsically wrong with them and both straight and gay people use them. But shocking the viewer is a narrative technique not an attempt to proselytize. One of the basic elements of telling a story is irony. Irony is when you present your viewer with a situation that they believe will resolve one way and then you resolve it differently. Irony makes stories interesting by drawing you in and forcing you to question how the story will end since you cant assume that it will end as you assume. Sun beating the crap out of someone presents you with irony and forces you as the viewer to watch more closely. Again this is basic narrative technique not proselytizing. Korea is still a very conservative country especially in business environments. This is realistic. And this reinforces the irony about Suns situation she is extremely capable both physically and professionally but she is surrounded by an environment that tells her she is less than her brother because of her gender. It makes the reader wonder what made Sun who she is and how shes going to handle her situation going forward. Well plenty of parents of trans people really do act that way. Thats realistic. And it tells you about who Nomi is shes the type of person who went a complete  on her upbringing. Compare her to say Sun who continues to live by her familys rules despite being physically and professionally able to act on her own. And compare Nomis family to Amanita who stood up to her friend in the park who insulted Nomi.  Again the pissing on the grave not the cross is not about disrespecting Christianity per se. Its function in the story is to tell you about Wolfgang he is the type of person sees nothing as sacred because he is willing to piss on a grave as a casual act of loathing. This sets up his later interactions with other characters as ironic and unexpected. It also tells you that he hates his father. Likewise the scene with Wolfgang breaking into the safe that is not to glorify stealing but to show that Wolfgang is a proud manhe wants to crack the safe not just break into it. The Hinduism being glorified is part of setting up Kalas character to make the next part true It is irony to present Rajan as a seemingly perfect fiance but have Kala reluctant to marry him. It makes the viewer wonder why she wouldnt want to marry him. She is a religiously conservative middleclass Indian the type of person you would expect to want to marry quickly especially to marry someone like Rajan. But she doesnt. It forces you to ask why which makes you want to watch more of the story and figure out whats going on.The first episode is a constant stream of ironic situations forcing you to question every assumption you might have about what this show is about who these people are what theyre going to do. Thats the point of the showthat you cant really make assumptions about people. People are unique and everyone has their own story. So in that sense yes Sense is trying to sell a viewpoint but that viewpoint is simply that every single person is unique and any assumption you might make about them might be wrong. If thats what you see as US lib college lifestyle then I guess youre right but I think youve misunderstood what the show is about.,Sense8,d1rct4u,24,t5_2wqui

10211531,0,t1_dby7lse,Yeah i think this is correct. Because one thing was finally cleared up for me. When Sun is in Korea everybody is speaking english. some shitty english some pretty good. I asked myself why they werent speaking Korean. Then when Nomi is watching her laptop with sun there whatshisnose  says I didnt know nomi could speak Korean or something like that. So for the viewers sake were hearing english for the shows sake they are actually speaking korean. hearing english but knowing its korean  artistic representation.  senesates fighting but knowing its only Wolfgang  same thing,Sense8,dc1j9ac,3,t5_2wqui
10239047,0,t1_dc3rwix,gt The whole notion of authorized killing being acceptable if not quite good is very disturbing to me.Disturbing to me also I just figured if I didnt include that snippet Id get a lot of responses trying to challenge me on how killing doesnt make someone bad if theyre a cop rather than responses actually related to my question.,Sense8,dc4nizz,2,t5_2wqui

10337878,0,t1_dcfq0hv,I disagree. I think considering how much shit Nomis done for him recently and in the past Bug would never sell Nomi out.,Sense8,dcfuuqy,16,t5_2wqui

10379126,0,t1_dckj85r,Plus they switched his actor which I was pretty pissed about. But he seems to be the farthest removed from  whispers and the BPO. Would be a shame if he just died In Africa because of his everyday life ,Sense8,dckjdkt,0,t5_2wqui
10705048,0,t1_ddiqrmk,OH MY GOD PEOPLE I KNOW THEY WERENT BORN ON THE SAME TIME OF THE DAY!lol anyway I already had my answers. It says on the sense wiki that theyre born on the same date but I guess it might not be true.   ,Sense8,ddk59mj,0,t5_2wqui
10729236,0,t1_ddmmn6e,Youre allowed to be insulted by my comment and Im allowed to point out that maybe this show isnt for you. A key part of this show is loving who you want to love and being who you are. If you cant handle sex theres plenty of clean shows about super powered people,Sense8,ddmn2jm,10,t5_2wqui
11423851,0,t1_dfoh3qw,Technically not because theyre all born in ... EASTER EGG INDUCED PLOT HOLE My Doylean explanation for that is the pool scene is iconic and It looks like a big moment so the Ws and Strasz went with it and didnt think about chronological implications but my Watsonian explanation is Litos from a Spanish family so maybe he was born in Bilbao while the as you said the novela is reruning and moved to Mxico in a Young age,Sense8,dfqvrkt,1,t5_2wqui
11705923,0,t3_670nm0,Episodes drop at around am for me so Im probably gonna watch the first  or  then pass out and keep watching till the end as soon as I get up to avoid spoilers on any social media which I will undoubtedly check through unconscious habit lol. If I get up early enough Ill finish watching before or around the same time most people who straight through binge it as soon as it drops. First fullwatch I usually just like to take in whats going on in terms of plot and then do a rewatch and figure out the lil things. ,Sense8,dgmw373,3,t5_2wqui
