72626,0,t3_1ux1m9,Yep its a post drill. It looks like the crank handle is missing see the open rectangular slot on the left side in picture .The downward feed comes from the pawl that catches in the notches in the top wheel. As the flywheel goes around it bumps the bottom of the arm and the pawl pushes the top wheel around a notch or two which causes the coarselythreaded center shaft to move down slightly.This one looks to be in mostly decent shape. Make a handle for it and clean it up and it should be ready for use. These old post drills are great for smithing work though the  straight chuck is a bit hard to use with modern bits.

It was introduced to womens fashion in the th century and was popular with both men and women in the th and th centuries. By the early th century muffs were used in England only by women. It is also reported that the fashion largely fell out of style in the th century. It briefly returned in the late s and s.citation neededgtIn Roman times the place of the glove was taken by long sleeves manicae reaching to the hand and in winter special sleeves of fur were worn. In Medieval Latin we find the word muffulae defined by Du Cange as chirothecae pellitae et hibernae. He quotes from a cartulary of the year  of the issuing to monks of sheepskin coverings to be used during the winter. These may have been as the Roman certainly were separate coverings for each hand although the cartulary cited also distinguishes the glove ...

If you hadnt played the game if you had only watched the movie seventeen years later would you honestly have a mental association between the line with that character?  One could as easilyassociate SUCKERS! as GET OVER HERE! with Scorpion from that clip and Im pretty sure that a viewer would have simply forgotten about both.Sure the line mentallyclicks with someone who has played the game and that movie was very very much targeted at appealing to people who had played the game but its not going to generate a new catchphrase via movie.  Its no Hasta la vista baby or even Do I feel lucky? Well do ya punk?In the original video game there were a few characters and they had a very limited set of digitized sound samples so the line was something that stood out and why someone who was pumping quarters into a Mortal Kombat machine would recognize the quote.,whatisthisthing,cgt6tdh,2,t5_2s3kh

1077709,0,t3_26gdqu,Backstory This charm was purchased along with an antique pocket watch a Rock City Lookout Mountain Lovers Leap souvenir jewelry box and a couple of plastic hair clips in a big pink cardboard box. This man was a known hermit but apparently he mustve gotten out of town in the past to see this. Now heres the heart breaker. While going thru the files it was discovered that this man was probably gay. In a small rural town that was mostly antigay it became clear why this man was a hermit. People in this area would have hated his lifestyle therefore he became a recluse and hated everyone! My question is besides the charm identifying who did he go out to Lookout Mountains Lovers Leap with? It was obviously important enough to keep a heart shaped jewelry box. ,whatisthisthing,chqsesi,1,t5_2s3kh

There will likely be fire sprinklers on the ceiling within  inches of that glass and the sprinklers should be spaced about  feet  meters on center. The glass acts to trap smoke long enough to activate the sprinklers which usually activate individually between    degrees F  degrees C.Draft curtains with closely spaced sprinklers are required for openings between floors and are common near escalator and stair openings like the one shown in the picture.

The virus reproduces using animal cells it essentially reprograms the cellular mechanisms to produce viral particles instead of everything they usually produce.There are various types of viruses divided into groups by their exact structure and coding but they all essentially write themselves into cellular DNA and use the cell to make more virus.Since the viruses or part of their genetic code is stored in the cells DNA for this process when the cell divides after being infected which it can do if the virus doesnt destroy it then the viral DNA is copied too.There is a lot of viral DNA in organisms we have gene sequenced.

2062693,0,t1_cl1ksa7,The difference between lead soldiers that are valuable and soldiers that are worth very little can be some pretty subtle stuff.  It can be hard to make an sort of judgement from a single photo.Do the figures have any markings on them?  Approximately where did you purchase them?  At least in the US imported goods made after a certain year that I always forget were required to be marked with the country of origin.Heavy for its size can mean lead and many lead soldiers have been made.  You could potentially do a submersion test to calculate the figures density to show whether they are lead or a lead alloy pewter but I dont believe it particularly matters much.Another possible indicator of age can be the date in your country at which point it became illegal to make childrens toys from lead.Some lead toys of this style were made by the children themselves.  You could purchase molds and use them pour the leadpewtertin yourself.  Then you paint it yourself.  Id say it was a little doubtful in this case since the paint jobs are all so nice.Im no military authority but I did some keyword searches trying to ID the uniform and failed completely.  Its a bit curious to me that some of them appear to be wearing something not unlike a kilt yet Im not familiar with and could not find any kilted uniform that lacked a sporran the pouch that goes over the front.

So my brother lives in a condo that overlooks the roof of the adjacent office building.  Every time I visit him I see this huge metal structure and wonder what it is.  The top is always flooded with water and there is a pipe thats constantly spurting more water into it.  Through the black grates I can see water dripping steadily  but there is no flow of water visible leading from the bottom.  The puddle you can see is from a recent rainfall  I would guess that its a heat sink sort of thing but theres no steam or anything coming from it.

Ill go ahead and put some points of interest in...Project Ice Cap  Hope I got that name correct.  Short version  A nuclear test that was something like  hours from happening when the break through in the negotiations for what became the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty happened.  They literally just walked away from it.  The white tower is whats left of the crane that would have dropped the nuke down the hole.  All the white cables on the ground are in fact...cables.  They were to run instrumentation.  And all the little buildings to the NE were instrumentation trailers.Sedan Crater  Biggest crater of em all.  Shot was designed for such as part of Operation Plowshares.  Imagine if you could dig the Panama Canal in an afternoon with properly placed nukes.  Yup that was the idea.The training center  To the left you see plane crash.  The upper right is a train derailment.  Just left of center but not to the plane crash is semi truck crash.  Two rows of sea vans towards bottom are supposed to be a city street.  Large white building on right is classroom area.,whatisthisthing,cmngugd,3,t5_2s3kh

Notice the phacopidas area to the right its much too smooth.With the lichid it really just comes down to the coloration near the outline of the body.

You can see in the additional views provided that theres a matching slit in the cup that coincides with the disk on the other arm. Theyre meant to go together some how.

3367743,0,t1_cpc2jo0,I just dont understand the assumed accusation I guess. Its as if European cars are notoriously worse than american cars and its a demotion to be owned by a Italian company even if being made design and sold in America. There are american cars assembled in Mexico by Mexican labor. But since these companies are owned  by Americans they are still domestic? I guess I just dont get the point. If something is Manufactured designed and sold in America why does what country the parent company is from matter? If something made out of the country by nonAmericans can still be considered domestic how does a product that is designed manufactured and sold in the state lose its designation as a domestic company simply because the Parent company is from another country?

4102063,0,t3_37lqzh,gt Caryota urens is the Fishtail Palm so called because the bipinnated leaves resemble the back end of a fish.  Urens means stinging and the fruit does contain a chemical that does sting. That said the kernel of the fruit is edible but it has to be cleaned completely of the stinging outer flesh.gt One of the odd thing about the genus is when it fruits the trunk the fruit is on dies. The single trunk Caryota urens grows fast and lives to between  and  years old but when it fruits thats the end of it though it can take years to die. The multitrunk species Caryota mitis does better and grows a source of more trunks. But they too die fruiting from the top down.,whatisthisthing,crnuzh1,44,t5_2s3kh

Complete with squeaky lever and hidden door and everything straight out of a goosebumps novel. The room had a chair too in the center for added creepypasta.The collection was MASSIVE too  ceiling high bookcases that were apparently packed.  It was a library. Anyways his lawyer told him not to call the police and burn it in the backyard immediately.  Even if he was calling the police because he found the stash the feds could and might still prosecute him.When I saw how big the fire for only  of the bookcases it was like watching someone burn millions of dollars of cocaine.

4947766,0,t1_cui65x9,I definitely think your headaches and nausea are related to it but I would try to focus on the water issue and how it might affect potential customers instead of screaming scary mold and hopefully they will look into it.  In the industry people screaming about mold killing them is common and people automatically assume you are a hypochondriac or that youre trying to cause a problem to get something out of it.  At the same time industry professionals will use ignorance to scare people into signing contracts for services they dont need and charge enormous amounts for them by saying youre gonna die.  It really sucks for me because Ive always worked for honest companies and we all have a bad reputation because of it.  To make things simple what needs to happen is the source of excess moisture needs to be identified and eliminated and removing the drywall and any insulation above would solve the issue.  Ventilation issues are more complicated because it may require changing the way air moves through the building and possibly moving ducts or changing the hvac system if you have one.  There are a few products on the market that actually kill mold but they may not be legal in Alabama.  If I was in town I would come by with a moisture meter and that would determine ventilation vs.plumbing leak a plumbing leak should show saturated drywall where a vent issue would show all drywall in the areas near the same moisture levels. but Im in Arizona so I couldnt just drop by on my way home and id have to charge someone to come by hahahaha.  Maybe suggest to your manager that you spoke to an industry professional and he suggested seeing if a local water mitigation company would come by and just do a moisture check.  That would be a low key way to start on a path to solving the issue and hopefully theyd do it for free.  If its a ventilation issue that would take someone at the hotel really giving a serious shit and at that point Id probably check to see if any other hotels are hiring.  Im sure youll be fine physically if you end up leaving the job.  Again let me know if you have any questions.  Im glad I helped a little.  Good luck!,whatisthisthing,cui7flo,5,t5_2s3kh

If you have a  vertical pipe of solid ice with a  hole running down the centre the flow of water through this hole will erode the hole making it bigger. Ice buildup occurs when it is warm enough for icesnow to melt but cold enough that when the metled water passes over the icesnow it freezes.

6291547,0,t1_cz4otra,I would not call this a hallmark because it is not a typical hallmark as you stated. Thats why I called it a logo instead. Im a collector of antique sterling I know about hallmarks. Sadly my parents thought studying books of hallmarks was fit entertainment for young children. This is not a hallmark. Its a logo stamped in the manner of a hallmark. I do like the piece even if it is costume. I dont own a lot of costume jewelry preferring the heft of the real thing so I dont pretend to be an expert on that. The workmanship seems primitive but that can be appealing. Yes it probably is not worth much. But I like it anyway. A jeweler might be able to ascertain if it is silver silverplated or merely base metal. Its impossible to tell from the picture at least to me. My personal opinion is that its plated.

There are many regional styles as you can see in the Wikipedia article  some say as many as a hundred just in England. They accommodate different types of stone and different types of animal. Im not familiar with one that uses such large capstone and they do seem to have used some mortar so this may not have been put up by a skilled dyker. The issue with mortar is that without it the wall will tend to settle and remain stable for long periods we have prehistoric dry stone buildings in Scotland that are up to  high but with mortar they tend to have areas of the side just fall away after  year.,whatisthisthing,cz8elug,3,t5_2s3kh

It is during these lowlight hours that the wild striped patterns and dermal tassels of the lionfish allow them to blend in with shadows and reef growth similar to the way tigers and leopards blend into the vegetation on land.,whatisthisthing,czsgn9n,1,t5_2s3kh

This is undoubtedly a tremolo harmonica as octave harmonicas are a bit of an odd duck mostly associated with Hohner while tremolos are popular in a variety of folk music traditions especially central though Eastern Europe and East Asia produced by a wide variety of manufacturers. Each hole holds two reeds which are meant to be tuned slightly apart usually  hundredths of a semitone certainly nowhere near an octave!,whatisthisthing,d0r5ze7,4,t5_2s3kh

6993884,0,t3_4bhca5,Isnt that cool? So much effort went into its creation and made by hand Ill bet. But anyway since its not a momentary contact like a push and release button Id guess that it might have controlled a small light bulb and not a buzzer. I know it wasnt uncommon to have a board in the kitchen or servants quarters with lamps one for each room. Each one handlettered with the names on them. Those were different times.  Plus its almost certainly a very lowvoltage switch I would think. It could have controlled other things but at that point in time there werent a lot of applications for lowvoltage electrical things.Thanks for posting. Edit Might be for radioaudio too A speaker switch. This little switch reminds me of an assistedhearing device installed at a local church about . Some pews had virtually identical switches except with  or  contacts each one for a different audiolevel for the listener in the pew.

They are usually used on roads but its not implausible to think that one could be designed for use in counting the number of people passing through a certain area each day. That data could then be collected and used to better plan and design areas which high pedestrian traffic like is done with roads. When a traffic study is done sometime traffic counting devices are set up for a period of time and then removed.

8570811,0,t1_d6atrzb,Well it depends on the type. Saturniids are popular for a couple reasons. They are hardy and they are also currently a threatened species due to an invasive Asian fly. A parasitic fly was introduced to the Americas in order to combat gypsy moths. It lays eggs on the gypsy moth caterpillars and the maggots eat the caterpillars. Unfortunately they also ended up targeting saturniids. As for how I got into raising them I took a course in lepidoptery as part of my undergrad in science and did a project focusing on saturniids. I dont consider myself a lepidopterist Im a hobbyist but I definitely know a lot about them.  Every now and then university biology labs and some nature groups will do an event on raising caterpillars and you get to take one home with some info. I would recommend this over trying to find some yourself as a workshop will provide info and a booklet on proper care. They are relatively easy to care for but do require some particulars that you need to know.,whatisthisthing,d6cxlog,1,t5_2s3kh

9222996,0,t1_d8l1xyb,I dont think so the box in the picture has always only been for Ricochet. The pole mounted devices for Automated Meter Reading tend to have multiple antennas. Some of the antennas are used to communicate with the meters and one is for the uplink.  The Ricochet boxes used unlicensed frequencies other services could use the same frequencies and interfere with them.  Utilities prefer more controlled systems and use dedicated licensed frequencies. The ownership of the Ricochet boxes is unclear the company went bust was bought out went bust again and died.  The power utilities also like to have the system under their control and put their street boxes on poles they own not on municipal street lamps. The Smart Meter systems dont just read meters they monitor the health of the grid all the way to the meter. Reliability is important. There are many things with antennas being mounted on poles these days.  Between public WiFi WiFilike networks for cops RF traffic sensorscounters traffic cameras with small patch antennas for uplinking the video smart meter systems EzPass monitors IR based traffic counters that look like cameras and other things it can be difficult to tell what is what.  I have seen boxes that look somewhat like the local Ricochet boxes but are not you can tell they are not local Ricochet boxes because they always have at least  antennas. One of the catches to all this is that I have never seen an Aggregation Ricochet box that I could positively identify as such. I know they existed but I never saw a picture of one. The box OP posted is a local node somewhere there is an Aggregation box that uplinked the local mesh back to the ISP. These may all be gone by now.

9387322,0,t3_595yx4,Toning TableToning tables are helpful for improving circulation and muscle flexibility and assisting with muscle rehabilitation. They are limited in their effectiveness in terms of weight loss. According to Body Toning Success the main reason to use a toning table is in the case of limited mobility or recovery from injury. Using a toning table for exercise is partially effective if the user moves his body rather than letting the machine do all the work. According to Living Healthy  toning tables do have some benefits that include assisting in performing isometric movements improving flexibility and posture lubricating joints restoring muscle elasticity stimulating blood and lymph circulation and performing lymph detoxification. Super Slim Slimming Clubs finds that toning tables help people with flexibility through isometric tensing and releasing of muscles but they are not effective in achieving inch loss. Weight and inch loss can only be achieved with a healthy diet and aerobic exercise.,whatisthisthing,d95wquu,58,t5_2s3kh

9456206,0,t3_5a6mda,So heres the skinny on these things  Regular records have the little hole but  RPM records have a big hole because that made it easier to build a changer for them like in a jukebox.  The spindle could be conical and if the record landed in remotely the right place it would slide down perfectly.  Most record players came with a little doohickey to put on the spindle to play a  but it was easily lost.  Also if you had a changer at home it wasnt likely the kind where it would take the record back off and put another one on it would just drop down one on top of the next you stacked them up on top of a little tab that stuck out of the spindle.  This was not compatible with the big hole in the s.  Again there was an adapter that came with the changer but they were often hot garbage that type of changer was never very good to begin with hard to get the records to stay and also easily lost.  Looked vaguely like a cigarette lighter.  The good ones were fully round but most changers came with the rectangular kind. ,whatisthisthing,d9en3lf,4,t5_2s3kh

Im copying part of a comment I made somewhere aboveIn both cases the wooden block sits on the legs and the legs are not simply extensions of the supports on either side.  In this example of a fire screen the legs are merely to hold the thing upright.  Since the screen is quite light they dont need to support much weight.  But in both of the posted items again the block sits on the legs which indicates to me that both items were expected to carry a nontrivial amount of weight.

It needs to have some input about where and how strong the sun is shining.The daylight sensor which data is used to control the headlights is located in the windshield mostly attached to the rear view mirror.

We always hated it because it would float to the top and screw up your finish. My info is dated however dont know how widespread the use of this stuff was or if it is still in use.

10545349,0,t1_dd3axb6,Absolutely this. Not just bitter almonds but also its cousins. Peaches produce small amounts in their pits.And look at mushrooms. Not quite the same story but many mushrooms defend themselves with frankly horrifying toxins. Death cap amanita disables cells ability to produce proteins.Those we havent bred the toxins out of just our food industry cultivates mushrooms that arent super ultra deadly. Most consumers never have to pick through mushrooms and figure out if what theyre holding will go well in salad or kill them with liver failure four days later.And fun bit  grass releases hydrogen cyanide when its cut. Your freshly mown lawn is trying really hard to kill you. In fact a few years back a beautiful lawn killed a small herd of cows.There are plants that produce oxalic acid  rhubarb  and we just avoid the leaves where the poison concentrates. Coffee beans and cacao are trying to defend themselves against being eaten by insects which is why they produce such terrible alkaloids as caffeine theophylline theobromine. Its stupid humans who gulp down these poisons and think it tickles. Dogs and cats dont find it so funny.Selective breeding has made our food supply much more abundant and a lot safer. Weve also incorporated food preparation techniques to mitigate some of the dangers until its become practically invisible to us. And some of the toxins caffeine capsaicin miss us and we dont even realize our close call.,whatisthisthing,dd3flkp,29,t5_2s3kh

I cant tell you what someone was thinking when they put a lock on however long ago. Maybe that person realized what they did didnt work so they took it off and that is why it is no longer there. Maybe it was to lock someone IN the bedroom. Hell my dad had those locks on our bedroom doors because we used to raise so much hell.

10769023,0,t1_ddqgj5k,The thing with Carlson is that he talks about many subjects and thus the solid stuff tends to be mixed in with the more questionable items.The cosmic impact he talks about is also often grouped together with the hypothesis of an ancient civilization that was wiped out by the effects of this event. I also believe there is good evidence to back that up. Graham Hancock which is also a good friend of Carlson has done great research on that.Ive seen some of his presentations and also independently looked into some of the details. There is a good amount of physical evidence just in the U.S alone but also around the world that seem to line up with such an event. The points he makes are very reasonable and based on geological data.He has appeared several times on the Joe Rogan podcast alongside Graham Hancock. I recommended if you are interested on this subject. Its a laid back conversation between the three of them but they also talk about much of the evidence they have to support their theory.

10911693,0,t1_de4uv1p,Im a Californian and I sometimes ask the question NOT because I am the blatant and wrong stereotype you assume but because people from Venice CA or from LA will often just refer to Venice.  Sometimes from the context it makes sense which they are referring to  e.g. I was wasted in Venice and got a shitty tattoo.  It sucks but The next day I met a hot guy at MuscleBeach!  but other times it isnt.Venice Italy does have a few beaches but not many and they are not the big draw for that city.  Venice CA has a large beach that is famous and brings in many tourists more than the canals there IMHO.Moreover the best beaches in Venice Italy are actually not in Venice  hence why in my experience people refer to those beaches by name  e.g. I had a great time on Lido until my shorts ripped.Of course given that OP is asking for an identification of an unknown object that maybe washed upon the shore location specificity is REALLY important.  If it is a biological specimen really important if not biological equally important since the Med. has little outlet just the straits of Gibraltar but Venice CA is on the Pacific and next to a major importexport hub  Long Beach.Maybe the commenter isnt the self absorbed Californian of your imagination but a person ensuring they have all the relevant facts.,whatisthisthing,de5gpf6,2,t5_2s3kh

The carpet was dry when I got back and discovered everything so I took their word for it. The ceiling of the closet did have to be replaced and they claimed the hole they cut up there would dry out the entire wall and there was nothing to worry about. The exterior has never been worked on. I did go ahead and buy  test kits from Home Depot screwed up the first one so I turned it into an air test.

The other is that as with highend jewelry this is a small item that is easy to transportship across borders without detection and also easy to pass down to heirs without detection by tax authorities.  Jewelry is preferred for this type of surreptitious wealth movement because its smaller and far sturdier and also has breakdown value selling.transferring precious metal and precious stones separately making identification of their origin nearly impossible but large and fragile art objects are definitely big players in the surreptitious wealth movement world. ,whatisthisthing,deantkk,3,t5_2s3kh

This barrier between the balls and the able when setting up takes some of the wear from the table.  Once the balls are in the right position in the triangle you slip the cloth out from underneath.

Also  the thickness is not thick enough for ASME B. which is the standard pipeline specification.Heat number is just a number given to the batch of raw material used to make the product.

11469838,0,t1_dfvp0hc,One way would be a combination of user reporting and automoderator. Create a subreddit rule where unrecognizable objects as they cannot be solved should not be posted and set up automoderator to depending on how many reports you get and how reliable they are message you or tag the post as unrecognizable and maybe hide or lock it.If a post doesnt get the unrecognizable tag then one month or whatever it just has to be shorter than the archival limit then have automoderator post a comment saying this has been assigned cold case status with instructions on how to handle posting answers about it and tag the post as cold case. Add a note in the sidebar with those same instructions and a link to search flair for cold case and that can serve as the cold case section.Im not sure if this would be possible with Automoderator but it probably wouldnt be too hard to do a python bot or something. Hell if you want I could probably take a shot at writing something like it if you can come up with a plan on how you want it to work.,whatisthisthing,dfw3mib,4,t5_2s3kh

11504577,0,t1_dfzeoxt,I dont believe thats anything more than poorly informed speculation on the behalf of the Mail. It doesnt really make sense. For one thing you dont use hardware to encrypt communications you use software.As someone who uses and configures secure VTC hardware on a regular basis HIPAA compliant secure communications used in medical and scientific research environments I can also say it doesnt make any sense that the satellite units would be speaker phones or even just speakers or microphones... My audio engineering background tells me that aside from the physical design of the units being completely inappropriate for any of those functions that audio is neither collected nor propagated like that and so they would neither suffice for secure collection or transmission nor really be necessary.There is certainly VTC hardware in the room theyre all looking at a monitor with a camera mounted on top of it. The black box in front of the monitor appears to be a user interface presumably but not necessarily connected to the VTC system. The white units on the table are interconnectednetworked to each other but not necessarily to any of the VTC hardware. If they are they dont provide the function of speakers or microphones and I have very little confidence that theyre involved solely for encryption purposes though I do concede they may well be part of some other security system.I think uCellbeep is perhaps onto something with the TEMPEST suggestion though. I wouldnt be surprised if they are emitters that perhaps jam other wireless RF IR and EM signals.,whatisthisthing,dg01lsp,3,t5_2s3kh

Their road their rules.However drive out onto any public road and it is our law that applies not theirs.  These people can not impose their wishes on the public commons that everyone else pays for.  Its a shared space.  Thats asphalt I paid for too and I dont want unlicensed uninsured drivers running around on it and neither do most people using it.  Thus there are laws.  It just doesnt work the way they think.Im a big fan of personal freedom but fundamentally theyre a bunch of freeloaders who think they own everything and can do whatever they want with shared resources with no accountability.
