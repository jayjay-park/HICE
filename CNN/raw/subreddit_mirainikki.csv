2644621,0,t3_2q6gie,id make such a better character than Yukkii qq. Ah but alas fictional characters in fictional universe. Worth noting that I never watch anime I did this on a whim because I heard stories of crazy psychotic murderous bitch and I have a  week break with nothing to do... Loved every bit of it though.,mirainikki,cn3s93l,1,t5_2u4ao

6254228,0,t3_41738c,gt My question is what happens to the rd World Yuki?  Due to what unfolded when nd Yukki and st Yuno invaded the rd world Yuno s parents realized how shitty they were when she nearly died at the school and stopped torturing her. She never had a mind break in this world as a result she never became attached to the Yukki of her world becoming a rather average girl now as a result of this Yukkis confession to Wakaba Brown haired girl that Yukki initially had a crush on that Yuno trashed in the Bunny suit is never hampered and Yukki eventually gets together with her and is far less of a social outcast because of it.    gt how exactly the rd world avoided destruction?    Im not entirely sure it did    Note From this point Im going to cite the Redial OVA which unless youve seen I suggest not reading just yet.    Now during the events of the Redial rd Yukki gets together with Wakaba and is not in any contact with Deus and his entire future is changed rd Yuno however is not that lucky.    She is normal but because the original MurMur from the first world survived Yuno s death Deus  MurMur and MurMur  imprisoned MurMur  in the Third World because of her borderline insanity and what she did however after Yuno  died MurMur consumed what I interpret to be Yuno s soul and by extension gained some of her power and personality.    This is why she appears to resemble Yuno when shes imprisoned in the Third world and her own personality and Yunos are struggling within her tearing her mind apart. So she calls out the the Yuno of the Third World who is by all effects an average girl she starts receiving the memories of the original Yuno and is called into Deus realm.    Skipping details she eventually finds the imprisoned MurMur  and she laments that she must put this burden on Yuno  but she has to and Yuno  willingly accepts because shes now getting tormented by her otherselves that died.    Yuno  essentially gets overwritten by Yuno s soul and power and for all intents and purposes becomes the very first Yuno in mind and body.    The dying Deus with the help of the newly freed MurMur  MurMur  DemiGod Minene and Akise open a portal into the void that should be the Second world Yukki and Yuno reunite and they start recreating the second world by their desires.    Now onto why this is important to the question you initially asked Deus is dying Minene has already declined his offer to ascend the throne of godhood Yuno  has departed the world with Yuno s mind and powers. There really isnt anybody that could save the rd world from destruction. Besides Minene Yuno  was the only one with the power to do it but she left.    So unless nd Yukki and rd Yuno decide to also take the rd world under their influence and keep it from destruction it honestly probably ends up dying without a god to keep it together.    Thats just what Ive gathered though I may be wrong Id like to hear what others think.,mirainikki,cz0jdbx,4,t5_2u4ao

11158301,0,t1_deva272,Hmm my memory could be off.I did watch the opening of episode  right now. And there is a series of flashbacks one which shows Yuno  killing Yuno  and then MurMur says We should keep this on the down low from Deus right now along those lines Im gonna lock away part of your memory from now.I wonder what exactly she locks away since Yuno seems to remember lots of things. And when is this memory restored?,mirainikki,dews55q,1,t5_2u4ao
