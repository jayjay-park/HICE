1410681,0,t1_cit3pl3,Yeah this is where my confusion lies. Im just wondering if Solo Day was to come out before Who Am I so they started shooting teasers...and then switched gears? Im not sure.But this picture has a time stamp of October   and it seems to be for this comeback. So strange. ,b1a4,cit3wrr,1,t5_2vuog

2108129,0,t3_2ibnk4,I went to the San Francisco Road Trip yesterday! It was amazing.I wrote this at  AM last night so please excuse my incoherence and crappy grammar. wI got to the venue about an hour before doors opened. It was a very boring wait since I was in line alone ehehehe.. The people in front of me seemed really nice but because Im super awkward I couldnt bring myself to talk to them.  The venue isnt exactly in a good neighborhood either so that wasnt fun. My friend told me that the venue sucks but I didnt think it was that bad? Theres a pit and then a balcony with a bunch of seats that go up. I was in the front of the balcony so maybe thats why I found it to be decent. I bought the second most expensive tickets because I couldnt bring myself to spend . It was still really enjoyable though! No regrets. When I got in I had a bit of a.. seat mishap. It got resolved though. While waiting for the concert to start a lot of the fans were chanting along to the songs being played. It was pretty cool. The screaming when the concert finally started was deafening. x.x I seriously felt my eardrums vibrating. The intro video thing was cute. Well the ones after were cute as well. Then BA came out.They are so good looking.  Flawless beings. Their dancing was extremely good! Like someone said it was really sharp although that mightve been because I was wearing my glasses. Videos definitely do not do them justice. They have so much charisma and energy too. I was really impressed.As a shy quiet Asian girl that does nothing but study I was kind of passive at the beginning of the concert. Smiling while sitting. But by the second or third song I was standing errr altering between standing and sitting it wasnt until the middle of the concert that I just kept standing. And screaming. I also sang along to the songs. u Sooner or later I began somewhat dancing and waving. Im honestly amazed and so embarrassed that I fangirled so much. What BA does to me  When BA did Chu Chu Chu with the lucky BANA I kind of died on the inside. I was beyond jealous haha.. Because who doesnt want BAs faces in front of them. Plus a back hug from Jinyoung?? I think back hugs are the cutest things ever. She is one lucky girlI might be crazy and delusional but I think they noticed me! I was in the last row of my section another section started behind me so I stood up freely. The members looked over in my direction a few times and there was no one standing in front of me so. D My heart skipped a beat each time. I attempted to wave and throw hearts to catch their attention. I also like to think that Jinyoung pointed at me at one point. Or maybe it was someone else.. its only been three hours since the concert ended at the time Im writing this but my memory is already fuzzy. I suck. gtltI had a really good time! Even though I went deaf and my throat kind of died.  Jinyoung Sandeul CNU Gongchan and Baro are awesome performers. I saw that at the beginning of the concert a bunch of people around me were just sitting but by the end of the concert a lot of them were standing and cheering. Yay more energy. gtvltThis concert reaffirmed why I love BA. I wanna go back.  I took the SAT in the morning too so it was pretty much a perfect way to end the day. Also because Im biased I have to talk about CNU. His dancing omg. TT Gives me so many feels. He has a really great voice too. Hitting all the notes. o I loved it when they all sang Drive acapella. lt,b1a4,cl7semf,3,t5_2vuog
