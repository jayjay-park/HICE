5938586,0,t3_3wo184,Most coin collectors will cringe in horror at any suggestion of cleaning coins. For coins in even halfdecent condition theyre right unless done very carefully with gentle methods cleaning will usually reduce the collector value of a coin.  For coins that I dig up if theyre in good enough condition that I can identify the variety and date I generally leave them alone except for a gentle washing with soap and water.That said sometimes coins that have been buried for decades come out of the ground so supercrusty and are in such poor condition that they have little or no collector value. Sometimes the coin is so toasted that it cant even be identified.  In that case Id rather try to clean the coin so I can get an ID rather than just leaving it a green unidentified disc.Note that rare variety coins or key dates may still be valuable even in poor condition so use your best judgment!Some methods Ive tried include Soaking the coin in olive oil for a few weeks. This method is often recommended but in my experience it doesnt do very much for badly crusted coins. Electrolysis. This is quick  takes only a few minutes and results can often be dramatic it can also easily damage the coin. Rock tumbling This can be effective with badly encrusted coins but it definitely scratches them up.There are plenty of sites online that discuss how to do these in detail.

8100065,0,t1_d4pjyzb,Hey Archery  thanks for the comments and response.  Never thought of it as a Dream On thing.  I got into metal detecting to get out in the air while having something to do and when I filmed it the challenge became how to provide some utility experiences and maybe a little humor to create a metal detecting video that someone who has never done this before could find entertaining.  Still figuring it out.All the mistakes Im making are real.  Not on purpose.  I really am trying to understand how to use this gear!   And there are some more serious things planned.  Ive found some awesome locations I cannot wait to get out to!love this stuff,metaldetecting,d4qiqmm,1,t5_2rizx

9390833,0,t3_597zfu,I did an experiment once where I dug every signal at an old park for three hunts in hopes of finding gold. For about  pulltabs dug I counted at the time I got one class ring made out of a weird alloy that corroded. My friends now who hunt jewelry say that nickel signals are more likely to be gold than pulltabs. Im sure it depends on the park too...I find way more silver jewelry in some parks than others so I would think that there is proportionately more gold jewelry at those places as well.,metaldetecting,d96cs8b,3,t5_2rizx

9628126,0,t3_5cv3v1,On the contrary a good detector makes a pinpointer all that much more necessary.  When your inexpensive detector finds a coin it is probably only a couple of inches from the surface.  Less dirt to have to dig through.,metaldetecting,d9zv4kw,2,t5_2rizx

10058440,0,t3_5jsmmz,I know its not metal but I was out detecting when I found it.Ive been kicking over and picking up flints for years until now they have all turned out to be randomly broken stones.I saw this from about  metres away and although Im no expert it was instantly recognisable as a hand axe. It was sitting on the surface of a disced stubble field. My local FLO has identified it as a Lower Paleolithic Cordate axe head dating from between  and  years BP.,metaldetecting,dbin0mo,2,t5_2rizx
10070786,0,t1_dbjrt3y,I just recently made a coin tumbler using an old printer. Theyre awesome for cleaning all kinds of finds I think itd work very well for bullets. I found a few pieces of what looked like absolute useless scrap I put them in anyway left them tumbling for  hours and out came an intricate beautiful pattern on what I believe once was an old pewter plate. Well worth giving it a go if youre remotely tech savy. Basically rip an older printer apart until you expose the paper feed reels. Glue some fins or bits of wood inside an old pickle jar or something put some abrasives in there I use sand and some small shale stones some water and some dish washing detergent. Put it on the paper feed rails watch it spin its surprisingly satisfying to watch. Then after a good  or  hours or even more.. Out comes super shiny cleaned stuff. I wouldnt advise using it on valuable soft metals or very old stuff but this technique allowed me to identify a coin I couldnt clean to identify no matter how much I tried with soaking and manually scrubbing it. ,metaldetecting,dbk8v7f,2,t5_2rizx
10206447,0,t3_5m5hbb,The biggest issue I find in these do you want an app posts is that the person who wants to make an app hasnt participated in the activity.gtFocus on ease of use and useable by both newbies and professionalsEasily and quickly add new finds so you can register in the field.Thats why I have a map and a notebook. I do have apps that I dont use that can pinpoint. I dont want to share my finds or share a honey hole with anyone.gtAdd photos videos and gps coordinates to findsMy camera does that on my phone.gtAuto and editable date  time on findsWhy? Part of the joy is documenting what you found.gtVarious fields for finds Tags coin junk etc. Metal type copper gold etc. WeightIDs on each find you add in the app so you could possible write the ID on a physical labelId spend  of my time documenting junk. I dont want to do that.gtRecord audio for finds sort of like a dictaphone so you can quickly move on to the next spot instead of having to fumble with onscreen keyboardI have an app for that. Dont use itgtMap showing all your finds where youve been etc.I have an app for that. Dont use it I use a notebook and an actual map.gtPinpoint feature that uses the phones magnetic sensors so you can use your phone in lieau of a proper pinpointer Im sure itll never be as good as a real one but will test this today.If thats possible you will put Garretts pinpointer out of business. I think too often people look to bundle features into an app and they lose the point of the experience. Metal detecting is a solo sport and it lets you explore and be quiet and think. The last thing I want to mess with is my phone.,metaldetecting,dc0yhp9,3,t5_2rizx
10236515,0,t3_5mkzlj,well technically.... anything valuable that you find you have to either turn it in or attempt to find the owner. The specifics depend on where you live. I remember a story about a woman who found what she thought were gold bars just a couple buried in her yard. I believe it was in Jefferson city Missouri and she had to put an ad in the newspaper for a certain amount of time  in order to try and find the owner before she could keep them. Well turns out they werent real gold. I once looked up the law here in Missouri and discovered that anything over the value of  you have to try and find the owner or turn in. This was probably  years ago though so things may have changed. Thats the technical aspect of finding something. Lost abandoned or mislaid property. No one really cares unless it is something extremely valuable. In general finders keepers. There is no way in hell am I going to worry about  simple gold ring I find. I am going to keep it. ,metaldetecting,dc4d6w2,2,t5_2rizx

10947747,0,t1_de8v3we,Its a legal thing  use of a metal detector is outright banned for general discovery  i.e. you must have a particular thing you are looking for to legally use one dropped a wedding ring on that particular stretch of beach etc.I think not sure though that they brought the rule in as people were thought to be plundering fields when metal detectors first came out. Since individuals were picking things out for sale or whatever they werent excavating neatly nor recording their finds and of course not declaring the finds to the government  anything significant belongs to the government for display in a museum collection.Buried treasure in Ireland can be highly valuable  see the Ardagh Hoard for example.
