The infamous GOTY yell fest Gabe rambling general disagreements. Yatzee has said he tries his best to wind Gabriel up both before and during the videos to make for more interesting listening. Dissenting opinions and all that. But in all honesty Yatzee does seem to go for the jugular with his insults and often gets really personally with it.,letsdrownout,cle01xk,2,t5_31j8y

4806860,0,t3_3gomrf,I honestly think its a coincidence. Im almost entirely sure that John DeFoe was heavily inspired by Jason Voorhees first and foremost Yahtzee probably admitted it as a guilty pleasure somewhere with the Jason X movie potentially being an inspiration for  Days a Skeptic I think Gabe made a joke along the lines of going straight to Jason X for the sequel to  Days a Stranger. Trilbys Notes seems heavily inspired by Silent Hill . Im not sure of the precise inspiration for  Days a Sacrifice but I feel like you can see a bit of Killer in there with the man in red being the most suitable example. Yahtzee has definitely mentioned liking Silent Hill  and Killer before and I personally get a strong sense that he played Silent Hill  shortly before Trilbys Notes and Killer shortly before  Days a Stranger. Its possible that Corpse Party may have been a conscious or subconscious inspiration but a number of elements in the Chzo Mythos games pull from the same somewhat generic horror staples of past works. A mentally challenged antagonist being a good example as thats an automatic you cant reason with the monster kind of fear.,letsdrownout,cu0g08x,3,t5_31j8y

It has bugs although its somewhat less buggy than older titles. Still the game can not be given a perfect score because of those bugs.I can not find any such musings in whatever flatulence videogame journalism spouts and therefore it comes very close to being entirely useless.If he makes jokes about shitty companion AI ill know the game has Companions with shitty AI. Now i only need to know if the game would force me to use those companions and if so i wouldnt buy that. Thankfully Yahtzee would provide such information as well and therefore is more useful for my decision to buy games then most of videogame journalism combined.Some other youtubers will have more information about possible future purchases as well yahtzee isnt the only exception to the game journalism is BS rule.,letsdrownout,cyms0u0,9,t5_31j8y
