1592500,0,t3_2cije0,The type of residence hall depends on your budget available space and if you want to be in a Residential Learning Community or not! There are suite style and standard res halls. You should check out  for more info on prices and locations of each hall. Overall I would say that CSU is a very friendly place. In my experience my classmates have been easy going and are open to conversation. Youll have the chance to make friends with the other students in your hall and we also have TONS of student orgsclubs.If you have anymore questions or just want a contact when you get up there feel free to PM me. Ill be a senior this fall a second year Resident Assistant  and Im involved in a few clubs. I hope this helps!,CSUFoCo,cjfwlev,2,t5_2spbq

3254169,0,t3_2xacvo,My transfer is a bit different since Im an adult student  who moved across the country. However the community here is excellent. People are generally very friendly and CSU has a ton of clubs to be involved in. If that fails check out some of the meetup.com groups in the area.,CSUFoCo,cozazmx,1,t5_2spbq

5966809,0,t3_3x1asl,I cant speak to the specific programs in which youre looking to become a student but I can speak to CSU vs. the other ones you mentioned.CMU like others here have said is in Grand Junction. Grand Junction sucks. Theres no simpler way to put it. The university itself also doesnt have a very good reputation.DU has an awesome reputation but like you said tuition is nuts.UCCS is upandcoming but right now its really just a commuter school and it means youll be in the Springs which are extremely conservative and religious  whether you like that or not is entirely up to you. It still doesnt have as good of a reputation as CSU or CU or even CU Denver.CSU has a stellar reputation and I can vouch for the fact that professors are expected to be teachers first and foremost rather than researchers. Sure youll have your bad eggs  youll get those anywhere  but by and large Ive had a very positive experience and have a solid job waiting for me when I graduate next May and my company specifically told me they prefer CSU grads above all other Colorado universities. Going here was one of the best decisions Ive ever made.,CSUFoCo,cy1s3bh,2,t5_2spbq
