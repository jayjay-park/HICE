2487159,0,t3_2o079w,Sacramento?? Dude you are right near California College of the Arts. Thats where I goto school majoring in animation. Heres how it isanyone worth being a teacher in animation that truly understands the process isnt really doing it. There are a few people out there still. CalArts is supposed to be so amazing because it produced a generation of amazing artists but most of the teachers that gave it that rep arent even there anymore. CCA isnt the end all be all of art school but its pretty fucking rad if you get in with the right professors. We just dumped all of our cash into the Animation department. Right now Im being taught by an amazing animator that worked for Disney for  years. Its alot of hard work. Late nights. Early mornings. I would say its worth it though animation in particular its like How to succeed in your desired field. It feels like job training but we get to watch like two movies a day and talk about how fucking dope animation is...seriously when I get my teachers talking about geeky stuff it never stops. I was getting my teacher to help me with my short film and as hes animating and teaching me he stops from time to time and smiles or laughs at The Emperors New Groove thats playing on the projector. I think its great that he can laugh with it since he animated Kuzco. Hella Cintiqs. Hella places to work. Open all the time. And its in the Bay area.Total cash suck but take away from my comment what you will. ,learnanimation,cmj7kk1,2,t5_2wsff

3549567,0,t3_30xz4d,What you are talking about is called line boil when yours lines arent consistent and that jittering happens it looks like its boiling on screen. If done in a very subtle manner this can actually be a style of animation. Of course it shouldnt be relied upon as oh this is just my style. The technique you are referring to is good old draftmanship drawing a line over and over again in a really tight space can be difficult to keep it smooth but its something that comes naturally after so much practise. Also when something is still on screen it should be treated as a hold redrawing the same picture time and time again when something is suppose to be totally still without line boil is not only really difficult but also redundant. If you are watching old school cartoons on TV then whats going on there is called pose to pose animation where the characters are only animated inbetween the poses that they strike meaning you only have a couple drawings depending on the action that have really tightly animated lines. If you are watching old feature animated films then the characters are moving almost all the time this is pure skill on behalf of the animators and inbetweeners of the day to keep something in motion during really slow movements is once again really tough. QUESTION ! this depends on what you are striving to accomplish TV animation now a days is done primarily with puppets and there is a whole department dedicated to creating them in a studio. Character animators now a days do next to no drawing and their talent lies in being able to manipulate the puppets or rigs to achieve the desired movement. This being said if you are learning to animate then you should do so by drawing lots and lots of drawing. The programs such as flash and toonboom still allow you to hand draw your animation if so desire too its just more cost effective and faster to do the puppet route. Lastly tablets are handy for puppet animation but are brutal for drawing looking at a screen while your hand draws else where is really tough If you arent going old school hand drawn animation in a digital enviroment  then the only option is to buy a cintiq which is a specialized computer screen that you can draw on and the screen registers your lines in the program of your choosing as you draw them. They are unfortunately really expensive the smallest of them being around  for a brand new one and  or so for a used one. maybe you can get lucky and find a really cheap one. If you are decided that you must use a program and you must hand draw then it will get expensive. If you have no money then the easiest way is to get a bunch of prepunched animation paper and an animation wheel with pegs on it for your paper then use an old camcorder or camera fastened securely somehow above a still board that also has an animation peg on it to take pictures of your drawings to string them together in some kind caption software. The software for that I think can be found for free online. This is very cost effective and is the best way to learn your foundation skills but it can very time consuming and that way of animating is no longer used in an meaningful wide spread professional manner. So if you are looking to learn to animate by yourself and get into the industry the foundation skills are of course a must have but you will eventually need to learn to apply them in a digital sense meaning getting a program such as flash and applying your traditional skills in the program. Either way good luck with however you choose to go about learning the art of animation its really cool to see stuff youve created move on screen.,learnanimation,cpwvgms,6,t5_2wsff
3871499,0,t1_cqtp3te,Hm yes. The more I look at it the more I dislike the timing. I think going straight ahead on the posing was a mistake. Should have stuck to making it pose to pose.,learnanimation,cqxl1yc,1,t5_2wsff

4787128,0,t3_3gbott,For me the best method is a rewardbased system. For example if I really need to practice drawing I will set a timer for  minutes or put a goal of  gestures or something and then force myself to just start drawing. At the end I will promise myself  minutes of Minecraft or some other entertainment.What happens often is I will become so engrossed in drawing that Ill be happier staying with it instead of firing up a game. If not then after  minutes of game time you go back to the other activity for another chunk of time.,learnanimation,ctxyg5x,2,t5_2wsff

6792451,0,t3_48sozn,For super super basic stick figure animation I remember using a program called PivotIts really simple and is puppetbased animation  its pretty fun and a good way to learn how to get started in animation.From there theres always flash or toon boom. Both of those are timelinebased animation programs and is a large leap from Pivot but are considered to be more along the lines of industry standard.,learnanimation,d0m7ota,2,t5_2wsff

9821412,0,t3_5fw59d,Hey bro nice work! I think overall its okay. Much of your movement is very linear and stiff. Check your slow ins and outs. The head doesnt feel connected to the body. When he looks up the chest doesnt rotate at all. During the times when God speaks he just stares into the sky and theres practically no movement or thought. Thought meaning the character dies because theres no breathing or slight movement you cant tell what hes thinking. Surely hed have some sort of reaction instead of just blankly staring at the sky. Also when he rests his arms on his legs after the phone pass theres no movement from the legs which makes his arms feel weightless. Overall checking the slow ins and outs and adding rotation in the connecting areas and perhaps a reaction during those dead times and couple breathing cycles will add a whole new later of feeling entirely. I really like your passing of the phone between hands. Thats nice work! Keep it up bro! ,learnanimation,danqz7c,2,t5_2wsff
