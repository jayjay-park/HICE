979904,0,t3_259xcy,Have you read all the books? If so maybe you could say what shes triggered by and i could list the chapters that have those things in them as a cautionary note or for avoiding alltogether and like others suggested she could instead get a chapter summary from tower of the hand or have you relate to her the specific plot beats. ,SRSasoiaf,chfo9b5,2,t5_2tlnt
1053261,0,t1_chnjfve,I completely agree about Dany! I was complaining before about how I like her so much less on the show because shes portrayed as arrogant authoritative impulsive etc. All faults I associate with her brother but less so with Dany throwing the family name around to impress people for example. I figured it was a combination of the acting and directing. Then someone pointed out that were not seeing Emilia Clarke being Dany were seeing Emilia Clarke playing Dany playing the Dragon Queen and maybe why shes so stilted is because shes trying to sound more confident than she is. I like that interpretation.But yeah what I loved about book Dany is how naturally timid she is  every time she asserts herself its a big deal because its hard for her. This Dany is just... I guess boring.,SRSasoiaf,cho0dyv,3,t5_2tlnt
4011848,0,t1_crcuqmb,Yep. Naive of me but I was waiting for Theon to stop it. For Sansa to stop it. I just thought surely surely theyre not going to rape the yearold I think Sansa who has been gaining agency and confidence steadily who we actually watched grow up who has been victimized many times over already surely surely.,SRSasoiaf,crdky67,9,t5_2tlnt

7849002,0,t3_4mmtwv,This was awesome and so perfectly articulated what Ive been trying to say for so long. Yes there is violence and depravity and terror in the books but there is also love and hope and gentleness. Actions have motivations and consequences and GRRM never shies away from showing us the effects these atrocities can have on people. The show is just like Hey lets gut these dudes itll be awesome!,SRSasoiaf,d3yapxp,3,t5_2tlnt
