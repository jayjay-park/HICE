8965954,0,t3_5331mw,i really like the melody on this track and the s pop style drum fills. the way the track is arranged is sort of like a trap song turned into a dancepop track and loaded with a bunch of lofi synths its really cool. the crunchy lead synth reminds me of something that The Weeknd would sing on and the track also has that slight darkness atmosphere that a lot of The Weeknds tracks tend to have. the mix of the track is cloudy and really mystical in the way it sounds which adds a lot of emotion to it. to me it gives me the feeling of walking in the rain at night with nowhere to go just walking.i think the only thing that stops me from loving the track is the fact that the sidechain is so aggressive. i know sidechain is necessary especially when using heavier bass kicks but this sidechain is so aggressive that it seems to dip well beyond the range of the kick drum and sounds like someone is just playing with the volume knob at times. other than that its a really great melody and a great vibe captured in this track.
