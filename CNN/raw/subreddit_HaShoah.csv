2943567,0,t1_co2ovhz,I think one of the issues is the lack of artifacts. Its true for other victim groups as wellpeople who continued to be persecuted severely after the war werent able to keep things werent comfortable giving testimony and werent easily documented. Weve seen many more researchers and historians coming in over the last few years who are studying the Porajmos so there will probably be more books coming out soon.  We did a seminar last year you can use the list of participants to search for more articles and scholarship  ,HaShoah,co2p3gy,6,t5_2zxvc

Older males were likely to be killed or are dead now and younger ones were really children and had very different experiences and memories of the war. Hes a bonafide survivor and I would be personally very happy if a whole lot more kept popping up.,HaShoah,cpdw9jh,3,t5_2zxvc
