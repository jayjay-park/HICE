1038539,0,t1_chm93ao,Well said. He was really skinny in the documentary but at the time he was just a kid. Im glad hes found his niche. That documentary is also responsible for turning me into an Asahisho fanit really looks like he took Kyokutaisei under his wing.

1568918,0,t1_cjcxn87,I am just trying to foster an environment of healthy discussion that isnt overwhelmed with conspiracy and paranoia.I will be moderating this subreddit and the general tone of the discussion with the same level of activity that you should expect from a mod from any other sports subreddit such as rnba  rnfl  rbaseball  rsoccer  rfootball   should they come across a reddit user who spams cheating allegations excessively.edit As long as everyone is polite things in general arent being spammed and discussion between people is happening you guys have nothing to worry about btw.

5187411,0,t3_3kpg0l,Day Unbeaten Mongolian ozeki Terunofuji put on another sumo clinic to dismantle ozeki Kotoshogiku and maintain his slender lead at the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament on Wednesday.The summer champion proved to be an immovable object as Kotoshogiku  repeatedly tried to belly him toward the edge of the ring at Ryogoku Kokugikan.After soaking up Kotoshogikus attacks Terunofuji timed his move to perfection and used a yoritaoshi frontal crush out technique to score an th win.,Sumo,cvb9ubp,5,t5_2qlgf

10108521,0,t1_dbp2xpt,I actually agree with you  itll be tough but thats why its a bold prediction rather than am accurate one haha. I think both Ura and Oyanagi will make their debuts next tournament for sure. But if we get a few extra Makuuchi makekoshi in the lower ranks and if Onosho amd Kotoeko can pull off  wins maaaaaybe  then it could become a really interesting logjam.,Sumo,dbp5gdn,1,t5_2qlgf
10351399,0,t1_dchc2ux,Does I care about combat sports mean youre looking for highquality competition? Because thats not something youre going to find in any amateur sumo that leaves out the rituals its like opting to watch local rec softball teams because MLB games include too much sideshow entertainment.Maybe we could interest you in something like Kintamayamas digests of the real thing instead?  minutes  bouts.,Sumo,dche3ic,11,t5_2qlgf

10984316,0,t1_ded0ar4,Ishiura relies on henka to a much greater extent than Ura does. I dont think the two wrestlers are comparable except in their relatively small size. Their tactics feel very different. ,Sumo,ded1cmv,1,t5_2qlgf
11026460,0,t1_defhhae,gtLast tournament he was  kg and he said he is aiming for  kg. I believe that is actually quite close to average weight in sumo.For a guy his height it is. Takekaze and Yoshikaze are two good examples of established successful Makuuchi Rikishi around that height range and theyre both about kg.Its still on the lighter side of things in Makuuchi and Juryo. I remember reading that Makuuchi average height recently was around cm and weight kg. The average weight has gone up tremendously the past  years.Edit Source for weight in ,Sumo,dehtosw,2,t5_2qlgf
