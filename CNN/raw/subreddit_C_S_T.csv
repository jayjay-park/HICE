Going to add a few mods here to spruce things up and delegate a few things book read ups video discussions which will appeal to different people and will generate some great cross discussion if we can coordinate a videowatching discussion team and a bookreading discussion team and try and make sure the topics themselves overlap somewhat.When I went deep down the rabbit hole  as far as US government stuff goes I always ended up in the Vatican somehow and the Jesuits no doubt have played a part and I think organizations like the illuminati and Freemasons while maybe influential in the past are more deflection at this point much like the Bilderberg shit every year that AJ touts on and on about.Once we get a comprehensive list if reading and watching material lets work on categorizing them religious control psychosocial control governmental control and take this sub up a notch.

4167124,0,t3_38i6pb,Ill admit I had similar thoughts especially after readinggtAn internal staff email from the BBCs head of newsgathering Jonathan Munro seen by The Guardian said This has been in the diary for some time  there is NO editorial reason why this is happening now.Its essential that we can rehearse these sensitive scenarios privately  BBC tours have been suspended and the blinds from public areas including reception and the media caf will remain dropped. Id also ask for your help in refraining from any external conversations and all social media activity about this exercise. Your continued discretion will be greatly appreciated.  Its mainly a technical procedure looking at the use of the studio. It does not involve any sites outside New Broadcasting House and it will not include radio or online.Apparently it was a test run apparently it was not meant for social media in any format making it questionable as to why it ended up on Twitter with the location of the Queen at the time the Queen was in the hospital. I mean why have it prepared and ready for Twitter if they wont actually be using Twitter during the training exercise? Training duh except especially with information such as The Queens dead theyd make sure everyone involved was using an offline format to not besmirch the reputation of the news centre or maybe theyre dumb enough to expect Ahmen to compose  tweets train in sending them without actually sending them using her Twitter account. So write hit send delete all text write second tweet hit send. Training complete.So a test run for what? The Queens obituary  seems fairly simple except when you look at the tweets themselves  BREAKING Queen Elizabeth is being treated at King Edward th Hospital in London. Statement Due Shortly BBCWorld  Queen Elizabrth has died BBCWorldThe second included the spelling error and both were swiftly deleted. BUT the Queen was genuinely being treated in KE at the time so the first was factual why delete it? oh right BBC facts the second is where questions should really be raised. Firstly why the spelling error?My thoughts? A Shoddy journalist though she got the fact the Queens in hospital right so she cant be that bad B A rushed tweet unintended for public viewing accidentally sent the official story and thus spelling doesnt really matter or C A journalist hitting gold wanting to have her name on it first sending it through spelling error and all then told to redact it immediately.So we have a journalist in training using Twitter as a test run unneccessarily as it would not include radio nor online for the Queens obituary and a rather shitty obituary at that if at my funeral all that was said was hes dead Id be fairly peeved and justifiably haunt those fuckers for the rest of time yes the BBC public statement claimed it was an obituary that accidentally publicly announced that the Queen was dead... except Ahmen the one who sent the tweets claimed no training was involved no obituaries were being planned. It was in fact a silly prank carried out by someone using her phone which was left at home.The person carrying out the prank just happened to know where the Queen was being treated at the time on the day while the BBC were waiting for a statement but they werent because it was all just training except it wasnt because it was a prank that just happened to be a lucky guess.Yeah either the Queens dead or she went in for treatment died but shes actually Reptilian and came back to life never actually died and will continue helping politicians hide their paedophile rings in due time.,C_S_T,crv9dlk,7,t5_37lis

Youre initially saying that the actions of  human beings are unlikely and that should cast doubt on it having happened. Then you say thisgtIf the world can have that many systems collapsing simultaneously then we should expect a  scale of devastation to occur more frequently.This argument isnt sound to begin with youre basically sayingIf probability of A gtThen probability of A gt some threshold that we can consider frequentThe conclusion does not follow from the premiseTaken together your saying that such an event is unlikely which means it should occur infrequently but also that such events should happen frequently which means it is not unlikely. gtThe best explanation is that there was a conspiracy. What youre getting tripped up on is accepting the official conspiracy theory as the best working hypothesis which it is not not by a long shot.Ok. Can you actually elaborate on what you think is the best working hypothesis of what actually happened? gtHow was the USAF so absent that morning and why? Yet in over Shanksville PA that plane showed evidence of being fulling obliterated in the sky and shot down. Building ....Building . The Pentagon hole looked more like cruise missile than airplane. Twin Towers were designed to take those size airplane impacts yet collapse...etc etc.So Im trying to piece together what you think just from this it would help if you just plainly stated it. You can correct me where Im wrong.Basically The government commandeered three? passenger? planes. It held back fighters from intercepting two? of them. It crashed two of them into the towers.

4548827,0,t1_ct3m47x,gt Try asking members of a black community whether they think it is flattering that the things they once were proud of being part of their identity as a minority are now just seen as fun and cool by the same preppy white kids that made fun of them for it not even  years ago.Its not the same preppy white kids. There were preppy white kids who rejected the culture and ridiculed it and now theres preppy white kids accepting the culture and viewing it above the one they were what should we say allowed ? at birth. Im British that doesnt give me the right to complain when someone who isnt British by virtue of birth and bloodline eats a Yorkshire Pudding or says init peng or piff.EDIT Also its not a matter of flattery its a matter of others enjoyment. Until the black community as a whole shows the collective ownership over the cultural artifacts and icons in question via patents or other legal documents they have no right to claim others of other communities have no right of use of those artifactsicons without express permission by at least  person of black lineage.gtThese kids still are nowhere near as close to recognising why these trends existed in the first place and what cultural significance they have to the black community and they dont care to know as long as they get likes on their Instagram posts of them with cornrows.Do most women know where stilettos came from? Male horse riders in Persia used to keep a better grip of the stirrups. Do you hear Iranians complaining about the cultural appropriation of the style of shoe to be used as no more than a fashion statement? More to the fact does that even matter? The history of anything can be interesting but not necessary to enjoy. I like tea does that mean I should feel guilty for all the Indians who died back in the day whenever I enjoy a cup? Or is it ok to ignore one cultural appropriation while denouncing another because it happened to be laced in blood? Guess what it all is thats pretty much the unifying fact behind all cultures  theyre stained in blood. Reminding ourselves of this fact doesnt help anyone dividing people between cultures doesnt help anyone and telling someone theyre wrong for enjoying something because theyre not the right colour is just downright racist. Are the mocking the culture or embracing the culture? Thats the defining line.gt In essence cultural appropriation has enabled rich white people to capitalise and make money off of black culture for their own bank accounts and fame without highlighting the important issues that black people face even in todays society.So a teen girl with cornrows is bad because a rich man has done bad things? That argument is tenuous and once again relies entirely on assuming the crimes of one of a colour lays on the shoulders of all who share the skin. Yes there are racial issues still penetrating societies. Segregation of culture only helps to breed contempt. Look at these immigrants coming over and refusing to integrate its disgusting! Look at these people adopting a foreign culture its disgusting and rude!gtA nonspanishMexican person can eat a taco and not be culturally appropriating Mexicans but then when you go on a public platform where you have social influence and dress like a chola and say me gustan los tacos seor you will be seen as being insensitive. So why is it now okay to do that with black culture? Because cultural appropriation of black culture has now gotten to a point where it is so mainstream that people dont bat an eye when nonblack public figures do it. Rachel Dolezal was a test to see how far we have come in accepting cultural appropriation and thankfully we arent that far gone yet.The difference as stated lies in whether theyre mocking or embracing the culture. Its like the law that someone has to be born in America to lead America. Its understandable in a time of racism and ignorance but once we move past that it simply suggests anyone from anywhere else wouldnt be as capable in running the country that no American could possibly share their ideological values over that of a fellow American. And its the exact same thing with any cultures  they should be freely adopted by anyone so long as theyre not simply adopting it to mock or deride.gt Also the argument of if she wants to do it let her who cares is a great example of white privilege. You might not care as you probably havent grown up to appreciate black culture as being part of your identity and roots but people who have do care but their opinion isnt as valid as it isnt as large of an opinion compared to the indifference of white people to the issue.I say who cares because and this is important no one is stopping them from continuing to act dress and speak how they like. No one is asking them to leave the culture they grew up in to make way for someone new. No one is asking them to turn their back on it and most importantly no one is forcing them to hang out with people they dont like. So they see it on TV and get offended. Thats nice I get offended by The Only Way Is Essex but its not aimed at mocking or deriding its just dumb so I ignore it and move on. The problem is when people are told that all their problems matter they start to believe it and when they can tie their petty qualms with something like race or gender youre called dismissive or falling on white privilege when you point out that their offence comes from a place they have no need of going to! They can have all the corn rows they want that doesnt mean that others may they be white or asian or native american or whatever cant have corn rows too! Hell Europeans had blue jeans long before America I claim cultural appropriation and offence and demand this stop immediately! Stupid isnt it? I mean its not like I can still wear jeans it just means you can too. Sorry only white people are allowed at the front of this bus. Its not offensive its part of our culture. You just dont understand its history.Cultural identity doesnt divide races but segregating cultural icons to specific races does cause tension and division. Why do you think they put Rachel Dolezal out there to begin with? To see if they could mock the black community? Pah! To cause divide and tension by people claiming she shouldnt be allowed to do that because of the colour of her skin.Do you know the history of tshirts? Do you know the history of cups? Spoons? Knives? Forks? Plates? Computers? Roads? Each specific word you use and its etymology? No? Because at some point in history they were cultural artifacts from a specific culture on a specific place. Then people realized the benefits and the culture spread and before long it purveyed through almost all cultures and was no more a culturally specific because thats how culture works. To stop people doing saying or acting in a certain way because the culture doesnt match their skin colour is simply to halt culture refusing to allow it to grow through fear it may be different  years down the line. Integration happens its happening now white preppy kids are no longer mocking the culture and to dismiss a new generation because the previous upset you is simply saddening.The world keeps on turning you can complain about the speed or simply enjoy the ride.,C_S_T,ct405cg,1,t5_37lis

I guess it depends on how you define powerful.  He was the head of the first government funded research group into rocketry in history is considered one of the greatest chemists and rocket engineers who ever lived was the leader of the California branch of the OTO provided and created equipment and technology for the military etc.  just read a biography of his life he grew up a member of a very wealthy family as well.  Hell Wernher von Braun himself said he thought Parsons was more deserving of the title Father of Rocket Science than he was.  Not sure how you define powerful but Parsons certainly meets my criteria.gt I feel this is just finding the one oddball character who fits the bill and then associating that one character with the totality of the global power structure.Just because I didnt sit here writing a  bullet point list doesnt mean hes the only or even best example.  The guy I was responding to mentioned Parsons so I added some more information about him specifically he alone isnt representative of the totality of the global power structure  that shouldve been obvious  but he was still a part of it and thus is one example.gt All of science began as occultism.

Actually little known fact  many of the early slaves were themselves white Europeans usually referred to as indentured servants but for all intents and purposes they were slaves.  And further European settlers in Amexem were originally considered secondrate citizens and they themselves were used as slaves and indentured servants by the indigenous Moors who already lived there.  You should read that Act  at the very least it establishes that Moors AKA black people were considered free citizens and held a place of prominence on the continent.You have to understand that this was a time a rapid change there was a war being fought an entire new nation coming into being and two governments with conflicting ideologies and agendas one attempting to subtly coopt the other over the course of many years.Check out the other one too the Naturalization Act.

Only European immigrants who were free white persons of good character white person was originally a Moorish term and referred to light white being the highest color in the spectrum were allowed citizenship.  So all indigenous peoples all Moors all slaves all indentured servants were immediately disqualified and the fiction of the white race was invented.gt I think you misunderstand the relation between George and the sultan.I dont think I do but perhaps you can enlighten me.  The newly formed United States of America was allowed to exist within the Moroccan Empire over which the Sultan was sovereign.gt Also John Hanson doesnt look very moorish and is said to be English or Swedish.Yep Ive seen that picture too.  Ive read a lot about this and theres a ton of conflicting information out there regarding John Hanson and his ancestry.  I can say with near certainty that the Swedish angle is a hoax the English one isnt so easy to dismiss.What Ill say is that its pretty weird how little information there is for a man who was by all accounts hugely important during the Revolutionary War and the founding of this country and was technically its first president.  Its also strange how about  years ago the John Hanson is a Moor meme started popping up all over the internet citing two pieces of evidence the first was a picture of a different John Hanson who was born decades after our Hanson died pictures didnt even exist in the s the second was a picture of the back of the  bill where one of the people appears to be darkskinned John Hanson wasnt there for the signing of the declaration.  These are both so obviously bad pieces of evidence so easy to prove wrong that it makes me think they almost have to be disinformation.Combine this with older history books where his Moorish background is talked about plus everything else Ive read regarding this period of history and in my opinion its more probable that he had some Moorish ancestry than not.Keep in mind that if my theory here is true theres been a massive conspiracy to create the white race and show that the US was founded by white men most of them masons while hiding the Moorish influences.  If this were the case it seems pretty obvious that they wouldnt allow a bunch of portraits of Moorish politicians to be circulated around proving their ethnicity beyond all doubt.Also keep in mind the title of this thread I dont necessarily hold all of this to be  fact  but I do think theres something here.  I considered posting about William Comyns Beaumont a prominent British journalist and author who makes the argument that ancient Jerusalem was just outside Scotland or about Arthur CherepSpiridovich a famous Russian count and general who moved to the US during the Bolshevik Revolution and wrote a book called Secret World Government or the Hidden Hand in which he named hundreds of Jewish families and implicated them in a massive global conspiracy to control the world  he was found dead just days later in a hotel with a gas pipe in his mouth and his death received no autopsy and no investigation.,C_S_T,cu1qkom,1,t5_37lis

That is why we are in this mess to begin with.So what we are talking about is your definition of a lawful state as opposed to others definitions with no judgement on who is right or who is wrong about what is a lawful state.The State intended by the constitution was knowingly crafted too infringe on human rights that is exactly why there is a very very important section on exactly which rights should never be infringed though they each and every one have been.gtNo response?People have delegated rights to the state they do not have. That is why you are so discontent with the current state of our country.

We arent talking about you selling your inconsequential  of ingots do whatever the hell you want with that were talking about the tens of trillions of dollars in the gold markets and derivatives markets and they do set the price in these markets.gt Other sellers are more than welcome to sell for less and other buyers may purchase it from them.This isnt what happens though.  Youre ignoring the reality of international finance and the hundreds of years of data to go with it.  Whether thats because you just dont know or because youre making a less than honest argument here for some reason Im not sure.gt Definitely better in fact Id say  on almost any day. For the simple fact that when they choose to buy all gold being sold below the fix the price changes exactly to the fix when they decide to sell to all buyers bidding above the fix price the price changes exactly to the fix.No shit.  Thats called using inside information to profit.  What do you not understand about that?  They set the price and then use the knowledge of this fixed price to make bids on the current price in the time it takes for the fixed price to update.  This number would not approach  in a free and fair market except in an extreme coincidence.You and I do not have access to this knowledge so we cant profit in that window of five minutes between seeing what the price is and knowing what it will be.

I know you didnt.gt There really is nothing underhanded happening here just powerful people making powerful moves....wow.  I dont know what to say here other than youre being willfully ignorant.

Explain to me what isnt underhanded about that.Let me ask you this if these bankers gain nothing from doing this if its just how the markets would operate regardless then whats the point of the gold fix at all?  Why does it even exist?  And how did NM Rothschild amp Sons just happen to be granted this power for hundreds of years?  Surely there shouldve been some government mandated way of regulating gold markets and prices so why are these massive private banks the ones deciding?gt Its worthless rocks forgive me if Im not all wound up over peoples irrational desire for them.Wow.

5629285,0,t1_cwutphw,Glad you liked my analysis. Okay the race thing I did notice and I see it as having several layers like most everything. It is a combination of legit marketing tactics and racism. Seriously though. Take a marketing class or talk to someone in retail specifically displays and they will tell you men cannot sell dresses and gringos cannot sell tamales. The dude just wanted to get rid of some salsa close to the sell by nothing more. Is it racist that the sushi place hires Japanese men? Or is it marketing? But the reality of wanting to liquidate a product is instantly viewed as racist by the divided workforce. Race should be embraced not used as a crutch or a weapon. Why care about something that cannot be changed? Embrace what does not change. If you do it will make your life way better.In a workplace democracy the role of better salsa girl would be known. The Latina would step in and do what a white person can only pretend to do. I.e. make or sell salsa to any efficiency. So a third layer emerges of classism and the divide created in a dictatorial workplace. As I believe you implied in your comment I see the use of this form of PC sensitivity as a way to simply farther divide the population along the race line. Why should she as a Latina woman have any say over what her boss says to her? The fourth layer is the implication that minorities can get out of work because it can be deemed racist and degrading. This is insane to me. In a workplace like we have you just do and hope you keep your job. Especially as a minority. Especially an legal minority. But she had good English I would suspect she was in the least a dreamer. The fact that they have to spend the amount of money they do crating the trash they are producing just is more proof to the inorganic nature of this kind of entertainment.

The idea of not incorporating shit has long been held by just about everyone but no one has ever agreed on the definition. Apparently weed has been agreed to be shit and kept from polluting us.So exactly what do you mean by shit?I dare say that I understand you very well.Your views are just restating the society in which we live but fully demands that we give up any vestige of eternity. gtFrom birth to death they are surrounded by an invisible host the spirits of men who never thought in terms of flags or boundary lines and who never served a lesser loyalty than the welfare of mankind. The best that every individual or group has produced anywhere in the world has always been available to serve the race of men regardless of nation or colour.Interesting quote. Imagine that a nice group of gentlemen deciding what is shit fully believing that survival is of the foremost concern.These same people have other concerns as well. One of their main concerns is population control. Fancy that. Just a guy telling people to live as if survival is the end all and be all and suggesting that we do away with the shit. Pray tell AthiestPriest how does following your advice differ from anything they suggest?I dont have to read your mind. If your originality is merely paraphrasing a widely understood existing position I just have to see that it conforms to that existing position and I can judge it according to the existing position.How are you to say what benefits my child?Hasnt leaving childrens care in the hands of experts what lead to  of the population on medication? Sorry but I am not going to act as if survival is the end all and be all. Im not going to do petty shit to get by. Im not going to bow down to power. To those who were fitter for survival cause long ago their relation sold opium. What am I? The same as you the greatest of Gods known creations. The conscience representation of all matter and energy of the universe. And being eternal in that each action I do exists within the universe forever and each moment of existence that I have is my eternity.And combining these facts that each of my actions will exist in the universe forever and within me as long as I exist I take the actions that reflect that I understand the gift of the universe and that it has been given to each equally and rather than using any temporary advantages I have over others to treat them as I would treat the supreme creation of everything  God.And actions representative of survival reflect not a secure knowledge in our place and the actions we should take but of a gnarly slashing of teeth to get one more morsel or to prevent others from gaining strength by having enough morsels. And when you arrive in your true afterlife you may wish that those actions you took to survive had rather been actions reflective of the opportunity you had been given.I would not trust someone who werent acting as if their life were eternal to determine what is shit and one that was wouldnt tell you what is either but fully disclose what they know and let you make up your own mind. ,C_S_T,cyovucd,1,t5_37lis

6234482,0,t1_cyvnn1c,I just finished reading the book and well...wow.  Quite refreshing to find some material THAT old suggesting some of the more recent ideas forged out of conspiracy may be onto something.I have looked into hallow earth and flat earth models.  Its not so much that the earth really is flat as much as using old physics as well as a few anomalous experiments over the years have created a small hole in the spherical earth model lol no pun intended.  Theres the rectilinear experiment and the tamarack mineplumb bob experiment which give credence to a flatconcave earth surface.But back to the bookIve been into electric universe theory for some time now and it basically postulates that electric currents permeate the vacuum of space and that when spreading through nebulous medium intersecting currents create some type of folding of space if you break a magnet enough times the field becomes circular so maybe if enough currents intersect you get a more spherical magnetic field which allows a globe to be formed which could then electrostaticly begin to pull the rest of the surrounding gasses etc.  Since we know each element has a weight and correlative frequency its possible that the center mass which accelerates the plasmamatter separates these elements by inertial spin slower at edges faster toward the centerwhich we perceive as a black hole which would give rise to a sphere from a discwhich is exactly the model this book follows to come to its conclusions.So at the center is a heated spinning plasma and the earths shell is the previous accretion disc that gravitational theory cant explain.This matches up so well with Walter Russells teachings about the formation of matter in space...definitely check into him you guys and thanks for the link for that book.,C_S_T,cyyajsm,1,t5_37lis

Id estimate it at a good four to five feet at least. Imagine youre in a jagged rocky environment with a backpack on that weighs about as much as you do completely messing up your center of gravity which is already messed up because of the change in gravity and all you have separating you from death is a fancy poofy fabric suit and a glass bowl on your head. You just risked your life on a rocket ride getting there... are you seriously going to now try to perform extreme acrobatics for funzies and hope to God that you dont fuck your suit up and kill yourself?Honestly I couldnt make it all the way through this video. Im sorry. I tried. I cant stand Coopers Im going to say the same thing over and over style. Seriously I got over ten minutes into this thing and he really didnt go anywhere at all. Does he get into anything other than the  gravity thing? Because I really dont think its a strong point at all.As an aside wasnt he the dude that said there was a secret joint USSoviet base on the moon? I thought that was him but I cant understand why if he thinks that we wouldnt have just shot the moon footage... on the moon. But maybe that wasnt him.gtAn analysis of photos supposed to be taken on the moon This one Ive seen before. There are a number of problems with the analysis that one can find around the web most notably that the author has deceptively distorted some of the photographs when compared to the originals and is using a linear mathematical formula in his calculations while the lenses on the cameras used on the Apollo missions should be accounted for using an exponential model. There are other issues as well of course but these are two rather big ones.gtWhere did NASA come from? It is part of the military and has some very interesting origins.

Just one of the many historical examples of how our twisted history negatively effects our current situation. If the nazis and the rest of the world for that matter had better understood that there was a global culture that lived happily and peacefully for thousands of years then perhaps we could have all fought the true enemy.Im just starting to wrap my head around this so forgive me if Im not coming across clearly.The nazis seem to have latched onto the real history of the Aryan race while excluding the multicultural aspect of the ancient golden age simply because a huge effort has been taken to white wash our history.

But this does not admit that everyone IS equal  just that they are treated equally. Also i too believe that it is not in our place to exact judgement and that all life is precious. But this does not debar us from making judgements about others  that is merely weighing observations with probabilities. In fact i believe it is necessary for us to judge others but when it comes to giving them shit unless its in defense its not our place.My point is the propensity to treat everyone equally is not necessarily mutually inclusive with the ideology that everyone is equal. ,C_S_T,d0qxuez,1,t5_37lis

7002714,0,t1_d1a385b,I think about information space a lot the place with all the information distances. Im glad you like the concept too. Its interesting how information is kind of innately organized so some concepts are naturally closer to others. Its interesting to think about how emotions change our perceived information distance when we panic our range of thinking becomes much more narrow. When we are depressed we only see the bad. I guess Im saying there is emotional distance just the same as information distance and maybe we could combine them to call it mental distance. Our state of mind affects how fast and accurately our mental distance can be traversed. The world of the mind is perhaps even more vast than the physical world. It is certainly more traversable. When we are calm and clear headed we can see far and in many directions in mental space. When we are emotional we can only see in a couple directions and engage in shortterm thinking that limits our options. Thats how I see it anyway. ,C_S_T,d1a3oz5,2,t5_37lis

7086262,0,t1_d1jcei4,What it would do was force us to fundamentally reconsider how we as individuals and society base the value of our continued existence. It wouldnt necessarily feed fat lazy people. If the food that came out of replicators was cleaned of all the shit that makes us fat and sick it might even lead to slim healthy people. Slim healthy people who are not being hormonally driven to be lazy. We would probably be more active than we are now and wed have more time to devote to doing the things we want. Right now the survival of a human individual can only be justified if that person is able to turn their efforts into something the economic world values. The things that allow us to exist must all be purchased with the sweat of our backs. If we dont work or dont otherwise produce something of value to the economic world we dont eat we dont have a place to sleep we dont have clothes to wear we dont even have water to drink. Its getting to the point where even the air we breathe will be owned by someone who isnt us and come at a cost. This is why unemployment is considered bad and things that remove the necessity of labour are considered bad. Because we need to have an economic justification for our continued survival as individuals. What this means is that technology will eventually render the human being obsolete within the economic paradigm of existence. What we need is a new paradigm. This one no longer supports human life. Something like a replicator might help with bringing about a new paradigm where we dont value our worth as living things based on how much money we can generate for the bloated ticks feeding on society  no not the lazy fat gamers the socalled elite. Sitting on your ass playing video games all day is still doing something by the way. Its not doing something that generates anything productive whether in an economic context or not. And its certainly not making money for that individual in an economic paradigm. The kind of person who sits and plays video games all day is doing so because real life is neither fun nor interesting  its just one endless purposeless grind where the only reward at the end is death. If we got rid of the economic paradigm as the basis of our lives there would probably be people sitting around playing video games... for a little while. Sooner or later though real life might even become more fun than the video games and those things would be left behind like the substitute for reality they are.addendum  the economic system is critically flawed in that there are plenty of productive endeavors that it is unable or unwilling to value. Such as all the productive work we do to care for our own households and children. Or the productive work we do for free out of love like knitting or writing fanfiction or other things that have no monetary value. It has decided that only certain forms of productivity count for the purposes of justifying your continued survival. With replicators and ambient energy harvesting we would be free to devote our time to the productive tasks that we do because we love them that are unvalued or ignored in our society right now.

Id say start with the Principia and other works by Thornley and Hill anything Wilson wrote especially Illuminatus and branch from there.

And I get that. However there is still such thing as natural objectivity which relates to the things that our minds agree on naturally. For example things like logic spacetime and contentconsciousness are all objective for everyone because our subjective minds are constituted in such a way that in order for any one person to experience another i.e. communicate at all there must be an underlying and most likely subconscious agreement between all minds in regard to the reality they coexperience. This agreement then therefore translates to an objective realityone that is true for all minds insofar as all minds have decided that it is true on the most fundamental level. Therefore objectivity exists but only insofar as our subjective minds are in agreement with one another metaphysically.,C_S_T,d1vodiq,6,t5_37lis

Neural network is structured as a topology of multidimensional quantum field which emerges in the network of neurons.  World operates on similar principles quantum fields but for it to be a consciousness it has to have an object to be conscious of  an external universe that is observed by this universe andmakes things emerge in this universe as observations phenomena.    This is a same question to weather this universe is a computation. It is similarly meaningless question  because all we know about computation is restrained by this very universe.  If you want to proove you are a piece of software then go ahead.  But notice  there is absolutely no reason for a computation to have laws of physics. So if this world is a computation it is such computation that is indistinguishable form real world in any way because it does not use any of the advantages of the virtual world instead it sticks to the logic of physical laws up to the tiniest bits. In other words  if it is a perfect emulation of reality and it is It is what we call  real.    And most certainly it is not conscious because consciousness is a reference loop  it is a reflection for consciousness to exist an external world is necessary. This external world provides data for your brain things emerge in it.  But thoughts in your brain do not operate on the laws of physics. If it had its own laws of physics youd never be able to dream about flying and all sorts of imaginary stuff.   It would perfectly run a extremely accurate model of the reality around you and so you could not have any consciousness it will be purely automatic.    So the answer to both your questions is  NO.

Those that are not aware of spirituality believe in only separation whilst more spiritual people believe in only oneness.The truth is as one of my favorite spiritual teachers Lester Levenson once said Reality is not black or white its gray. There is separation and there is oneness. One can in fact not exist without the other.Advaita which is one of the most popular eastern branches of Hinduism in western seekers talks about nonduality.What is nonduality? Nonduality is not really oneness because otherwise it would simply be called oneness. There is a reason its called nonduality. The word implies that the truth cannot be found in duality but you must go beyond it. This does not mean the truth is found in oneness as that is simply the opposite polarity of duality. So what gives then?Well freedom from my perspective is found when you realize that both duality and oneness are concepts manmade and are opposites or polarities that cant exist without eachother.Freedom is found when all concepts are dropped including the concept of oneness. Because Freedom Being God.... whatever you want to call it cannot be found within concepts it can only be seen and experienced beyond the mind.Here is also a great video from Jeff Foster that talks about the importance of seeing both the wave and the ocean in reality as equally important.Id also like to add that freewill and nochoice mentality is another tricky concept to talk about. You can say yes there is no absolute freewill when it comes to the personal perspective as everything is one Being and everything happens together so to speak in an interconnected way.But on a temporal level which is also valid where separation exists every form does have its own Will. Every atom every cell every rock plant animal and human has its own will despite the fact that you could say that on another level all of these wills are interconnected and together in a way form one universal will since everything is also one.Other than that this is a great post and I agree with the rest of what you are saying the importance of being the witness not letting yourself get carried away by thoughts how your deepest nature is simply awareness Being or Freedom itself.......,C_S_T,d3mdzj0,1,t5_37lis

If you have a ball located  feet from you and it moves  foot sideways that will be less obvious.Or conversely move your head side to side and youll notice things in the foreground move a lot while mountains in the distance dont seem to move at all.Same deal with stars. They ARE moving thousands of miles per hour. Theyre just so far away trillions upon trillions of miles away and theyre trillions of miles apart from each other that their motion is undetectable without really advanced satellite equipment. Measure from one side of Earths orbit then measure from the other. Then maths.Unfortunately none of us have access to that really advanced satellite equipment. So while we can understand why the stars dont appear to move when you neglect the movement of the Earth we as laymen have little way of knowing even the approximate distance of stars.So when NASA tells us Sirius A is roughly  trillion miles from Earth we just have to accept that.

But taking out the planck length would reduce the accuracy of the solution. Just the fact that they managed to have the planck length in their correct electron rest mass equation makes their equation relevant.

These are not fair comparisons whatsoever therefore i do not see this as a valid argument supportive of your claim. gtvomit comet vs ISSAgain you are failing to consider the turbulence involved within those planes. They go up and down rather quickly with their zero gravity simulatory descents lasting seconds. Momentum of the bodies and movements of the air has no time to reconcile towards equilibrium in this scenario. Again this is not a fair comparison to the environment aboard the ISS i do not see this as a valid argument either. If we are to be honestly analytical of all of this we must be prudent when considering all of the variables in play. Cherry picking variables between two completely different scenarios in two completely different environments proves nothing just because two variables are present in both scenarios does not mean they should be analyzed equally. Dismissing important factors will give you the wrong answer.

The problem is that with the established advertising techniques its become less is more approach to reach as many potential clients as possible. Heres the difference that they face with millennials they are not as coherent group as generations before them they have always had the possibility to connect to others outside their immediate vicinity due to modern communication so they are more independent individuals among their group then say the baby boomers.And heres the kicker that make advertisers hate them they are more expensive to advertise too.

A call to action is a call to action not a call for more talking.This awake woke asleep way of distinguishing people is inherently offensive. It assumes ignorance on the behalf of others. First we are in no position to judge others. Second there is no objective test for whos ignorant and whos not.I think Im woke you think your woke that person thinks theyre woke. Many more people think we all sound ridiculous especially those in power whether or not were actually ignorant or knowledgeable. We can have all the facts the knowledge and show people the correct path but they have to believe it. There is no convincing some people because they have decided their life is as good as it can be theyve settled theyre locked in. Unless you can guarantee that their life will be better in the ways they want their life to be better you can count them out of the revolution. Whats nice though is they wont be directly aiding the enemy either.We have to accept that a lot of people are always going to be too scared or too busy to fight. Thats always been the problem with essentially raising an army. You cant wait around for them even though they may join you later. You definitely dont want to insult them by saying theyre asleep ignorant or worse yet programmed. Further more in many cases its not that people dont know its that they cant do anything wont until other people start doing something. These are the second wave they wont join until the movement has started.Its not enough to wake others and be awake. People need to get up out of bed and act. You think youre woke? Take this off the internet off little papers and onto the streets. Find others in your area and organize community. Figure out how your group can supply a sustained protest and movement. Maybe you dont want to protest maybe other actions like boycotts and closures would be better for your situation. Maybe you can just create instead of resist. We all need to be generating in some amount big or small our own food water shelter power network alternative economy and most importantly real community. We need to build alternatives to this horrible system. Otherwise power vacuums form and we find our selves in an even more overt police state. People stop tolerating the lies of false hierarchy and scarcity by replacing them with self sufficiency.We can talk knowledge all day but talking alone wont change things. Neither will simply complaining in the streets. No one is happy with the way things are. Things are the way they are because government wants them that way. You either trust government or you dont. Thats all people need to know. After that whats most important is to enable people to actually do something to change their situation to change the things they are not happy about thats where all the self sufficiency comes in again.I fully support what you are trying to accomplish here over all.

Bush was the cofounder of Raytheon their name literally means Light of the gods the company that went on to become the worlds biggest manufacturer of missiles. They also invented the microwave oven and probably several of the weaponized microwave devices used for mind control these days. And yes he was the guy behind the Manhattan Project. There was a long and very fascinating interview with Bush on YouTube before but it seems to be gone now. I only found this short excerpt of that particular interview.I recently read this which is related to the MIC and the way they seemingly helped create the modern rock music scene.

But its come to light that Hillary Clinton gave her the order to go in because Hillary wanted the media to be done with the event and instead to talk about Hillarycare which would become obamacare a little less than  decades laterThats one wrinkle to the story the other wrinkle is that the whole occupation of waco was done as an assault on a burgeoning trend of antimasonry in Texas at that time...that was being led by a person David Koresh branch davidian leader was following who had been trying to keep freemasonry from being represented in some kind of Baptist convention that was apparently a big deal.  Koresh and his people were easier targets...so like shooting fish in a barrel masons manufactured outrage and terrorism  militia ideation in the branch davidians through propaganda in a nearby library system knowing that it would induce an fbi counterterrorism investigation that would then culminate into the events at waco.  Masons used the fbi to kill the Branch davidians.  Which begs the question what is the Clintons  CIAs relationship with the freemasons.......something Ive been trying to figure out for a while now.All this was tracked by the LaRouche that produces EIR executive intelligence review a fortnightly intelligence  academic update on events happening at the time that you wont hear about until  yrs after they happen by reading their archives and saying sonofabitch...so thats what happened  You think its crazymaking then you fact check them and sure enough they were right about everything you checked.

The bluepilled are living in a reality where Hillary was elected bringing more control fear etc. and the redpilled are here in this reality. I cant point to evidence aside from the sheer confusion and surprise when we learned the results. The air felt different in the days after the election not good or bad but almost of a mix of hope for a new direction mixed with apprehension about the huge amount of work that lies ahead.Since then Ive noticed a considerable change in my relations with the physical world. It feels more positive and optimistic. And it seems like the dominos are falling even more quickly as more people are awakened and discussing it publicly. e.g. Kanye West being handcuffed to a gourney and taken to a psych ward after denouncing Hillary Zuck Bey JayZ radio  the music industry etc.Hopefully this makes sense.

Their phones and tablets will go up in price because our wages just cannot compete against a dollar a day workers. What they will probably do is automate their assembly line to avoid US wages which means hes not bringing back as many blue collar jobs as people think.Carrier said they are only bringing half those jobs back here and half still going to Mexico.

9878240,0,t1_daunb7i,This is a difficult question and even I am not sure about the exact answer but here are my thoughts on the subject nonethelessFirst of all the difficulty is in the point of how one defines enlightenment? The word enlightenment is now usually used for someone that is free of any identification with the bodymind construct and thus free from the identification and consequences of karma. Now this does not mean that this person is free from karma or that he has nullified his karma. There is A LOT of karma. And even if you disidentify with the bodymind karma will still continue to have its effects on you even in this life  the difference is even if you get cancer or someone breaks your arm both seeds of karma sprouting in your life you will feel no pain as you do not identify with the body anymore.Such a person has a reasonable amount of control over his life and destiny but a lot of it he still has no control over as the karma from the past is still strong enough to determine large swaths of his destiny. A being like that is pretty much free from all suffering though it is possible he might reidentify with certain karmic patterns if he does not go all the way to complete full realization which I talk about belowOften even in the spiritual community the word enlightenment is used for a more mild state of being partially free of suffering yet being very evolved spiritually nonetheless. Usually what the Buddhists refer to as a Sotapanna.Now if we talk about fullrealization or absolute enlightenment the highest state then the person is free of all karma and free of identification with the bodymind. This means that the world is like a playground to him and he can do whatever he pleases and decide his destiny in its totality as long as it of course does not interfere with the will of any other being  but since a fully enlightened being would be completely aligned with all there is with the Oneness he would act out of pure love and thus with his actions never go against the will of anything else in existence.Such a being is free of all cause and effect and all his actions are completely new. Since there is no mind conditioning or karma affecting his will he can create all that he chooses.If he chooses to incarnate he can with ease without the need for any being to give birth to him materialize his body at will. He does not need to eat sleep drink even breathe shown by Babaji in Yoganandas autobiography  I think Babaji even materializes a palace from nothing in that book  Babaji is Krishna btw and Yoganandas book is a classic and a fun read read it if you can its full of miracles such as people regrowing arms...etc.. He is exempt from all laws of physics and can also easily create simply using his mind  such miracles as performed by the Buddha or Jesus for example  Jesus walking on water turning water into wine easily healing people...the Buddha teleporting himself over rivers with his followers creating bridges made of gold having the ability to fly....Ultimately such a being could even create planets of his own...there are little limits when it comes to creation as all is fundamentally created through and comprised as thoughtvibration.Ultimately all of these are called miracles when in fact it is simply the natural state of all beings to be able to create freely as they choose with their mind which I use here as the name for the creative instrument of the universe the mind is not the brain the brain is however part of the mind. All laws of the universe are simply superimposed on the natural state and one has to adhere to them simply because of the limits or karma that he himself carries in his subconscious.A completely free being is also free from absolutely all suffering and is in a state of the deepest bliss joy love and peace.He will also fundamentally know himself to be One and yet separate in his own unique form with all of existence and see himself as total Freedom  as Nothing or rather NoThing since we usually a picture of what nothing is in our mind which is of course not what Im referring to indescribable with any facet of the mind.In the words of NagarjunaIt is not assumed that the Blessed One exists after death. Neither is it assumed that he does not exist or both or neither. It is not assumed that even a living Blessed One exists. Neither is it assumed that he does not exist or both or neither.The attainment of this Nirvana or highest enlightenment is the attainment of total emptiness the emptiness of anything that is manifested. That emptiness is of course not what you think it is it is empty of all that can exist yet it is the source of all these things thus it is also the source of indescribable bliss joy love and peace.If you wish to check out the Buddhists take on the stages of enlightenment Wikipedia has a pretty good article on itArhat I believe is the highest stage but in Mahayana Buddhism there are even higer stages.In Mahayan Budhism I think Tathgata is the highest stage.In more simple and practically applicable terms your spiritual progress is measured by the degree of absence of suffering when everything is against you. This means that the degree you can feel love peace joy bliss even if you are in a most unfavorable situation even a king can be happy on his throne when in perfect circumstances  that however does not indicate spiritual progress  see how you would respond in terms of inner peace and love in regards to the worst that the world could throw at you  then you will know you have made a step closer to Nirvana  when you can be at peace and unharmed even when a war is raging around you.Hope this sheds some light on your question It is how I understand it but I could easily be wrong of course so do your own research on the topic and check with your own inner intuition and inner guidance to know the truth  always listen to your innerself and intuition which has access to all knowledge  first.,C_S_T,dav5oqn,5,t5_37lis

He has fallen into cinism thats why he say the kids werent really in Tienanmen because they were fighting that would imply hes not doing the right thing.They fight the corporal language if its intended cmon its soad shows Daron is frustrated and yelling sometimes and disappointed and sad others I think hes mostly disappointed because he see things so clarely and they dont understand why people dont react but he express that feeling with anger. Meanwhile Serj rise one hand like saying Cant you understand me? Im powerless I cant do anything. Finally Daron ends their rampage accepting Serjs point but not in a good way he accepts hes not going to make Serj go further thats why his face shows pain.Shortly Serj wants to accept what propaganda say because it justify his lack of action Daron is trying to make him realize it and wake up but in the end he surrender.,C_S_T,dbjpi42,3,t5_37lis

So when I get a completely new dream it sticks out in my head.I took a break from PG a little over a week ago and I received a very odd dream during this break as well. I was transported to what my dreamself interpreted as Alefantiss apartment. Alefantis was there and I was sitting on his couch. Everything was neatly arranged brightly lit white carpet white couches minimalist design. He was kind and was cooking some sort of sauce...he said it was his pizza sauce. He had me try it and it was actually delicious. He explained how he wasnt always gay that he used to be married and tried to have a child but the child died in utero or something and this was why he had so many pictures of his godchild on his Instagram. I was wary of his explanations and I wanted to take a deep look around his apartment. He let me do this and the whole time he kept saying just as you said when they are shown they are wrong it will end all this. It was truly bizarre and I woke up feeling like someone had planted that dream in my head. I have nothing but suspicions about this man and I havent thought positively of him once. I try to contain any extremely negative thoughts about him so as not to cloud every perspective I have of PG with it but anyway Ive never thought of Alefantis in a good way. This dream was completely bizarre to me and Id rather not think it was Archons or anyone messing with my head but who knows?Merry Christmas...or well I guess its not Christmas anymore but I hope you have a great week anyway.

If people were not lazy we would never have invented anything.  You dont look for an easier way to do things if you are not lazy.  We would be stuck in the stone age or even before without our inherent laziness. ,C_S_T,dbwnjwu,4,t5_37lis
10168524,0,t3_5lkrhd,Its true though. Our leaders have failed to plan for the future. Profit is the main goal here along with its power counterpart. The youth today are born into a system that doesnt really have any use for them. And the future is totally uncertain. I wouldnt say its purposefully constructed but rather a byproduct of capitalism. It really comes down to short term greed vs. long term planning.As a genXer I grew up still in the dream. If I hadnt of screwed around so much I probably would be in better shape financially. But back in the s and early s I wasnt worried about the future I was excited for it. But then things changed. It wasnt about hard work anymore. Good paying jobs became a lot harder to find. Basic living necessities became more expensive. Things just tightened up to the point of where we are now. A service industry economy preyed upon by by the wolves in the financial sector. ,C_S_T,dbwnp8c,5,t5_37lis

People better dig into where these ideas come from.The Technocracy movement of the s that another poster discussed vid link below is another variant on this. Its a US face of the same old slave junk. The Trilateral Commission continues this work right up to today in the Obama admin. Slavery is a good litmus test.The other part of the plan is strife. Again read the slavemaster article For advance in civilisation has rested on something else than collaboration at least than friendly collaboration. Friendly collaboration is the beginning of civilisation and during all the advance of civilisation it remains one of its factors. But there is another factor which is the exact opposite as regards the accompanying feelings. This is strife contention competition.  One fighter whether an individual or a state may subdue another subjugate enslave that other compel that other to join forces with those already employed. Thus strife may cause involuntary collaboration as in slave gangs and in this way contribute to the advancement of material civilisation.Get the SJW and AltRight slave gangs to fight...,C_S_T,dc1dfoy,4,t5_37lis

Doesnt it always play out that you shouldnt say the name of the evil entity for fear of invoking him? Perhaps TPTB have set up our society where we are told to worship their God but only they know his true name and thus their power?Have you ever looked at the Cathar religion? I find that interesting as my basic understanding of it is that they rejected the God of the material world the one we know as the creator i.e. He who made all the material things and they believed that all of this material that was created was put their to distract us from the true God and we were misled to worship material things. A lot of those kinds of ideas ring true for me and also the Catholic Church the corrupt one not those who follow their religion with good in their hearts were very determined to wipe them out so that also piques my interest...But Ive only really read snippets here amp there so am by no means an expert perhaps I have misinterpreted the whole thing or been misled with disinformation amp therein lies the crux of the problem. Is black white is dark light? As above so below or as below so above or is this old adage more disinformation distracting us from looking within or without or considering other dimensions altogether?TPTB are on record as following rituals so that would suggest a belief in either an entity or a power or has that information been intentionally leaked to lead is further away from the answers?An important question to be asked I think is Why has no one ever gone down the rabbit hole you are considering and then led the way to the truths after making their discovery?. Is it impossible to do because of the warned dangers? Has there just not been the right person to do it yet maybe that person is you?? Or have the people who have made the discovery realised that no good can come from sharing their finding? Or have they been each amp every time effectively silenced or their credibility been destroyed?Not what you want more questions. I am not one who has ever found the time to meditate but sometimes I do think this is probably the true way. I dont think we can ever know by looking for answers in the material world.But I am just guessing too. If you did want to take the risk and dive you could perhaps log your findings each day here or in a blog a bit like how explorers back in the day would map their journeys.

There are aspects of fear love hate joy in all materials. Thus the chair youre sitting in has an emotional state. Rocks in the ground experience feelings. Entire forests can have a certain disposition.If you think about it this isnt so far fetched. What makes humans think? The neurons in our brains. But what are neurons made of? Molecules and atoms.

When the establishment doesnt like somebody they get NO press SEE Ron Pauls presidential bid. Therefore acting like his inflammatory tweets public speeches and interviews are playing the media and hes some sort of establishment burning renegade maverick here to save us from our corporatebankingwarmaking overlords is too rudimentary I thought for rconspiracy and definitely too lowbrow for this sub I hope.

But those minor semantics leftright paradigm partisan arent really my original argument though you seemed to really want to focus on that bit.My original point was I think the post was getting downvotes cause snatchers came in and went heavy with two proTrump posts in our calm little neighborhood thats been mostly free of that kinda talk. This sub had a big surge in growth as an exodus from rconspiracy occurred to get away from all that td influence that overtook it. So downvotes would be somewhat expected. From what I could parse in your original reply you were agreeing with snatchers original premise and saying yeah Trump totally has played the media with his genius inflammatory tweets that stir up his detractors. Hes so good at being inflammatory that your Trump post is even earning downvotes here. And Im saying No the whole focusing on Trump for anything is nauseating and boring as hes part of the prowrestling facade of modern politics that we dont really GAF about.  Anything that talks about how great or shitty another establishment stooge is we dont really want to give attention or focus to  because its another  yawn  puppet.

They didnt cite that particular fact so it could be in dispute. Im guessing this will likely settle out of court even if just to limit the publicity of the story and get him to sign a nondisclosure agreement. But even if United was not allowed to cancel the contract at that point I still think I have to side with the police as odd as that is for me. Police do not and should not be expected to know the nuances of contract law.  The airline contacts the police and tells them that this man has been told to leave their plane and is refusing. At that point I think we want the police to enforce the criminal trespassing law which the property owner claims. Any adjudication of the contract law should be left for the courts. Im more amenable to changing my position on this than I am if United was indeed legally able to terminate the contract at the point they did.

11574300,0,t1_dg7inl0,well Jesus fulfilled a lot of prophecy and a lot of it upon being examined reveals itself to be extremely precise and impossible to have been planned or faked by men. Then the appearance and the success of the Christian religion which included a host of fantastical supernatural claims about some guy who had just recently lived in the same area where the religion was known to have originated really makes absolutely no sense unless the claims are true since the claims are extremely specific and were reported to have many eyewitnesses and the people of the region would have known if they were totally false. Since these claims were not stopped in their tracks it demonstrates that something happened in those days that made these claims extremely believable even though they would otherwise be totally ridiculous claims. So in short real prophecy and real supernatural power. These two things set the narrative of Jesus waaaay apart from any other mythological narrative none of which have either of these two characteristics to substantiate them. Once you have that core basis that Jesus actually was Jesus then other things will naturally follow from logic alone. For example Scripture is supernaturally prevented from being tampered with. Jesus himself alludes to this and the fact that all the Old Testament prophecies remained intact also demonstrates this. Then beyond that we have the picture of who God is. Ordinarily we could not observe this since there is no direct evidence. But now because of this logic we have the testimony of Jesus giving us a heads up about who God is and what we should do with him and we know the testimony is good.

11652834,0,t1_dgbg55b,.  Gang Stalking of PoliticiansBefore the internet this was hard!  And dangerous!  And practiced by the good guys and the bad guys.  We used to sit in the temples and then sing to the people what we heard there.  We used our music and our musicians and sounds.  Then we sat in the courts and wrote to the people what we heard there.   We used our language and our metamusicians mathemeticians and symbols.  Now we sit in the darkened server rooms and the illuminated laboratories and were trying  to use anything we can get our hands on to communicate.  We mastered the vibrations of metals.  The Point the location of a charge.  The Line telegraph telephonic.  Then we learned crystals   The Sphere radio television.We learned the vibrations of a new energy nuclear radiation but the only information we could communicate through it was too immense to hear so we transmute it to lines and spheres that we can handle.  We made the word Annihilate.VERBannihilates third person present  annihilated past tense  annihilated past participle  annihilating present participledestroy utterly obliterate a simple bomb of this type could annihilate them all  a crusade to annihilate evilSynonyms destroy  wipe out  obliterate  wipe off the face of the earth  eliminate  liquidate  defeatAntonyms createdefeat utterly the stronger force annihilated its opponent virtually without lossphysicsconvert a subatomic particle into radiant energy.ORIGINLate Middle English originally as an adjective meaning destroyed annulled from late Latin annihilatus reduced to nothing from the verb annihilare from ad to  nihil nothing. The verb sense destroy utterly dates from the mid th cent.Annihilate is a Big Word that doesnt lend itself easily to communication beyond Stop and Die unless we transmute it to Power in lines and spheres.  So we kept working in the realm of crystals.We make golems out of crystals.Do you think that Politicians are the brokers of Power?  Are they the movers of Power or the Face of Power?  Did the politicians create Power?  Or are they one facet of a crystal?If you sit silently amongst the birds you will hear twittering.  This is not bad their silence warns of danger their tone and timbre carry information.  But if you make no sound youll hear a hum amongst the twitter.  Who is humming?  Should we listen to that hum too?  Absolutely find out as much as you can about the Eagles that lead us.  The Hawks scream war the Doves say peace the Cardinals talk about spring the Vultures feed on death.  Hear their song and sing it everywhere so that the flock doesnt fly in the wrong direction.  Look for the Humming Bird too.  Too small to notice far away too fast to track they fight amongst themselves.  The Eagle is at the front of the flock but the Hummingbird Hums the direction and the flock follows.,C_S_T,dggv323,1,t5_37lis

11696594,0,t1_dgl9tjg,This fits into what Ive researched about Buddhism and Hinduism. When you become a fully enlightened being you escape the reincarnation cycle of suffering. I have no idea why one would want to do that because Im confused about whether you cease to exist or exist in a dimensionplane beyond our world. Supposedly you live in another world not the former but thats definitely hard to prove and just as much of a leap of faith as believing in a heavenhell in the Abrahamic religions. But the goal is to escape the cycle of reincarnationsuffering and I definitely believe in reincarnation but I dont see this world as suffering. Theres suffering and pain but theres also love joy and happiness. This duality makes things poignant. If youre in some crystal heaven after successfully transcending reincarnation then wouldnt that get old and boring? ,C_S_T,dgltsla,5,t5_37lis
