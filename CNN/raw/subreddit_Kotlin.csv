6346455,0,t1_czaut71,I should have been more clear. Futures are not superior to Rx or for that matter inferior. A Future type is a monad sorry for using the M word  which makes it easy to compose unit map flatMap are extremely powerful. Its also IMHO simpler to understand and has a much smaller API surface area that the developer needs to understand given that we are actually not dealing with Streams or Enumerable types and backpressure. If you like Rx then thats exactly what you should use. ,Kotlin,czb0sib,3,t5_2so2r

6741292,0,t3_4804w5,Kotlin officially supports all platforms supported by Java  Web desktop and Android. In order to use Kotlin for Web development you do not need a Web framework written in Kotlin because Kotlin fully supports all existing Java Web frameworks which are more mature an fullfeatured than anything that could exist for Kotlin. If you think you do need a pure Kotlinbased solution look at Kara.,Kotlin,d0glvjj,1,t5_2so2r
10463456,0,t3_5pv4c6,The value type parameter on KProperty is covariant so KPropertylt Stringgt is a subtype of KPropertylt Anygt. This means that withCriteriaEmployeename  can be fulfilled inferring RAny.I cant think of any way to make this work with val. If you use var and KMutableProperty instead it will work as expected. Otherwise you could define withCriteria for a predefined set of types    fun withCriteriaproperty KPropertyltT Stringgt value String    fun withCriteriaproperty KPropertyltT Intgt value Int    fun withCriteriaproperty KPropertyltT Longgt value Long,Kotlin,dcu50qr,2,t5_2so2r

11172956,0,t3_5xnog3,You may need a build tool. If you use an IDE IntelliJ or Eclipse they handle the builds. But Im using sublime and the command line so Ive had to learn some gradle,Kotlin,deyfxju,1,t5_2so2r
11255313,0,t1_df60vw3,The difference is that immutable collections perform better than readonly collections. For example to append to a readonly collection you have to copy everything whereas for an immutable collection you share the same elements and structure as the original collection but theres no danger.If you ever work your way through the FP in Scala exercises you get an idea of how a simple immutable list works early on and a lightbulb should go off ,Kotlin,df7rtwb,3,t5_2so2r
11634273,0,t1_dgeq77z,Either of your suggestions would work but now youre dealing with querylanguages and adding a lot more complexity.Ive been playing with new  returning the value returned by the closure.  So far in my experiments this seems to look ok.,Kotlin,dgera4t,1,t5_2so2r
