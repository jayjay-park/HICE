Its not just that these areas arent gussied up with trees as the nicer and older neighborhoods of Mexico City are its that they do present serious issues on all kinds of fronts that are of the same magnitude or greater as say the issues presented by sprawl here in North America.,urbanplanning,ceeohu3,2,t5_2qhp7

Younger people in America are showing a clear increase in civic engagement seeking out prosocial neighborhoods that in which walking and talking and biking are easy and transit is efficient. This choice is motivated by a variety of factors the most commonly cited ones being economic hardship and a perceived urban hype. I dont doubt that these factors are influencing some people but n my own personal choices economic considerations have only ever been a gateway appeal. The density of jobs and the ability to opt out of car ownership kept me in the city long enough to see the many other appeals of city living.

This causes conflicts between pedestrians and cyclists but as time passes and sidewalks get fixed these problems will be solved for the most part.In my opinion this can be labeled as a successstory one of the few my hometown can be proud of.

Except that again carbon emissions from a power plant are higher than those coming from a car because you have to use twice as much fuel to get the same amount of energy to the car. Also Humans may be shitty drivers but there is a certain limit to how many cars can possibly be on the road at once and that limit is lower than the number of people who need to get in and out of large dense downtowns on a daily basis. Even if you drop the length of the car there is still a limitation one that trains dont effectively have  or busses. With automated trains if you ran one train line every minute with long trains you can move like  people per hour per direction. In the same amount of space  a two lane road with cars even ones end to end you can move about  people per hour per direction. See the difference there? Trains dont lay WASTE to space like cars do  thats why I dont think theyre going away any time soon. Theyre far more effective and efficient for large dense downtowns that by the way are only going to get larger denser and harder to serve with just cars.

Public transport is a great way to make up for that. Nobody determined that nobody would want to live in upper floors of taller buildings probably a lot of people do but its not beneficial to the city according to city planners such as Jan Gehl. Jeff Speck argues both sides but both people say that some places make it work. New York make the streets work because the large buildings make up for the wide streets but dont see outside caf sitting in places with very tall buildings very often and they contribute a lot to the street life.

5909712,0,t1_cxu9kc1,I think most of that is largely speculative... but so are my counter arguments so fair enough.AVs might not be inherently detrimental to active travel modes but a commitment to anything in urban planning comes at the expense of something else. In this case the contested good is allocation of space for specific modes. Most cities do not even come close to providing sufficient infrastructure for biking and walking unless you happen to live in Denmark the Netherlands or other places with strong emphasis on these aspects. A continuation of a caroriented transportation system necessarily maintains the main obstacle to better infrastructure for active travel modes which is a fight over available space space that is precious in cities. This doesnt change a lot depending on whether the cars have drivers or not unless AVs finally convince road planning authorities that you can get away with a smaller lane width for cars. But there have been good arguments for that for years and they have remained fairly immune to those.So AVs provide a heap of benefits but unless they drastically reduce the amount of allocated space for car infrastructure the benefits on active travel modes will be marginal at best. In fact I reckon they will delay the implementation of dedicated infrastructure even further since AVs become an excuse not to spend any money on the built environment.Ill admit that this is not really a drawback of AVs as a technology but rather the likely implementation of it. But this cant really be ignored. Theres been plenty of evidence of new technology becoming a pillow for decisionmakers to fix real issues. Electric cars were the last of such. So if planners are a sceptical bunch its because there has been no end to the promised salvations but most of them being little more than good intentions and plenty of them achieving the complete opposite due to rebound effects. Meanwhile tried and tested solutions are ignored over and over.edit spelling,urbanplanning,cxuao4j,1,t5_2qhp7

6639521,1,t3_46kur5,I chalk the whole argument up as like most things in life Just dont be a dumbass. Everyone has responsibility in keeping themselves and other safe. If youre crossing a street give it your full attention. Thats how we were all taught look left look right look left again and walk. I ran a little study in college and found that most people who text and walk or talk and walk do so in packs. As long as the first person in the pack or someone else has looked and confirmed the path is clear everyone else follows assuming the same is true. This pretty much works the same for a lot of things...Anyways if Im driving Im expecting whoever is crossing the road to do so with care. Likewise I approach a crosswalk specifically looking to see if a pedestrian is there. A lot of times you cant actually see the pedestrian because theyre milling about not paying attention on their phone and you end up driving past them.I get it pedestrians want drivers to be responsible which is fine... but driving is taxing. Theres a lot of different stimuli that you have to pay attention to and a lot of that is noise. Every time you pass a row of parked cars you have to expect that some pedestrian is going to come pop out from behind a car or a dog is going to run out or a kid. Then add a crosswalk in the mix now youve got to watch both sides of the crosswalk as well as paying attention to oncoming traffic or people turning or stopping etc.Its a twoway street. Just pay attention do your job and get where youre going. Neither person pedestrian or driver can do all the work. If youre driving or walking get off your phone.

They converted many former Zellers locations to Target stores and closed the rest. The Zellers in my current City was a pretty run down relic from the s in a secondary tier shopping mall so they closed it. I suspect that Target was planning to build a new store in a brand new shopping centre that is currently under development. This never happened so in my community it had no impact.However the Target did convert the former Zellers location in the City where I am originally from as it was built in the s and was in the communitys premiere shopping mall. The original Zellers was already huge and Target added  sqft on to it and did extensive design renovations.  It really looked impressive and from what I understand was one of the best performing stores. Unfortunately Target left . years later and the space is now used by local Car Dealerships to have huge but temporary car sales. The regional mall it was in is now losing tenants left and right.Zellers was in trouble anyways but I think Target would have done better if they had of kept the existing Zellers  brand and their supply chain closed some of the dumpy under performing locations made improvements and slowly evolved it into Target.

7293886,0,t1_d278rq5,So you know how supply and demand curves work? The supply of land is fixed which means its a vertical line. Theres just as much land available so the land rent is determined entirely by demand whether the land value is taxed or not. If landlords are already renting out at market values this changes nothing for their tenants. Whether or not they can get away with increasing rent isnt changed by the tax its determined by the demand. If theyre renting out below the market price then theyre gonna have to do something about that. It could mean turning an unused warehouse or a parking lot into residential office or commercial property. It could mean raising the rents on their existing tenants. It could mean selling their property to someone else to manage.This does not guarantee affordable housing but it does guarantee maximum usage of land. It means there will be far less unused or underused land which implies a higher supply of housing which implies lower prices.Land value taxes disincentivize speculation so of course sale prices are going to be lower. Its that way around that the gap in purchase and rental prices is affected. ,urbanplanning,d279knd,1,t5_2qhp7

7457647,0,t1_d2pcw7q,gt Some will move from nearby spaces which should be affordable but are not because the big complex on the parking lot isnt there yet.That I dont know of such an example is not proof that it does not exist but I have yet to find it. Nor do I expect to. Most often that small apartment building that grew expensive before the new luxury apartments are built stays expensive after.I dont pretend to be an expert on the dynamics there but Ive come to understand the following things  The people living in the old buildings will likely continue to do so for a time. I mean lets say Im a middle class single person and my rent is mo and Im perfectly happy with everything in my apartment aside from price. What incentive do I have to move to the mo apartments in the new tower? Just because its there? No. The more I spend on rent the less I have to spend on other things and I like those other things so Ill keep my rent as low as I can. If I do choose to move and increase my rent it will almost certainly be because of some life event  a better job someone moving in with me etc. The life math is way different for owners though. So as a result...   The rents will not drop if people still want to live there. A landlord isnt likely to drop rents in a fully or mostlyoccupied building. And if the turnover is modest  which it will be if the city or neighborhood is a hot commodity  then vacancy is unlikely to be enough of a crisis to force the landlord to drop rents. Especially since...  Landlord expenses will go up. Desirability is contagious. Do one thing to increase the desirability in an area for monied interests and the whole area starts to look pretty good. This increases worth of the land which in turn increases property taxes. Furthermore people of decent means expect buildings to be wellmaintained. These both provide upward pressure on prices since the landlord wants to maintain her standard of living as well.,urbanplanning,d2pvyo1,0,t5_2qhp7
7473821,0,t1_d2ro68q,To add to your commentI believe that density policy will be one of the most pressing matters of urban planning and design in U.S cities over the next few decades. Chinese cities are being built at an unprecedented rate largely due to lax environmental and building polices and enforcement. U.S policy especially at the local level is all about tradeoffs. California as well as other states with especially stringent regulations would see ENORMOUS economic growth as a result of more relaxed environmental and building codes. However many people in California and the U.S to some extent believe that these regulations improve their overall quality of life sure they will see a decrease in economic activity but they are betteroff in the long run. Now there will always be debates about the right level of regulation but Id bet youd find a good chunk of people who support at least some level of environmental consideration of development projects. There is no doubt that the Chinese economy has grown by leaps and bounds as a direct result of their lax development policies but economic activity does not entirely contribute to an individuals quality of life. Cases of extreme environmental degradation and pollution in China is just one aspect of this consequence.  If density increases and a good chunk of people end up unhealthier andor unhappy did density really solve anything?LA is experiencing a lot of NIMBY pushback for largescale development projects. Some of the NIMBYs concerns are more warranted than others and many people would agree that the citys density needs to catch up to the growing population. Overall however city planning in the U.S is slow and pragmatic because of the publics involvement. This pragmatism was integrated into our governance system on purpose and the planning field involves a lot of balancing contradictory needs. This in my opinion is the main disconnect between traditional perspectives of urban design and urban planning.,urbanplanning,d2rq9d2,1,t5_2qhp7

The lowest density allowed in transit corridors is  units per hectare units per acre Of course much higher values are preferred or even required in some areas but I figure it may help answer your question. But its very simplistic. A more useful number includes indicators of mixed use of various kinds. Queens universitys Prof David Gordon did a comprehensive study of indicators of suburbanness.

7905690,0,t3_4nj1hq,Property tax isnt regressive. Its a capital tax not an income tax. The poor pay less property tax because they have or rent lower value properties.More property tax by itself lowers the value of properties. Its the cost of that property just existing and that makes speculation less profitable. Which reduces the impact of speculation on the propertys value. A high enough property tax will destroy speculation entirely deflating property prices to somewhere around their useful value. It still makes sense to developthat will greatly increase useful valuebut speculatively holding onto valuable properties and land and doing nothing with them is always a bad idea. Use it or sell it.The main flaw of property tax is that it may not be comprehensive enough. If only built properties are taxed you get parking lots next to skyscrapers. The parking lot pays little property tax because theres nothing on it but yet it is land that could no doubt support another skyscraper. Indeed the bulk of value in urban property is the raw land of the lot its on even if theres absolutely nothing on it. Use it or sell it.If you want to look at a regressive tax look no further than sales taxes. People with low income put more of their income into daytoday consumption and will pay more sales tax. Richer folk do not consume as much in proportion to their larger incomes and have options to spend or save their money in ways that do not accrue sales taxes.,urbanplanning,d44ob62,6,t5_2qhp7

8725663,0,t3_4zjf51,Well this is certainly an interesting perspective to say the least. A few points The simple fact is not everyone can afford to move especially across the country so there are still major equity issues involved with unaffordability in coastal metros. Its not just the educated tech set having a bad time  most of them can still afford to stay in SFNYDC albeit at prices they dont exactly prefer.  The bigger issue is the massive underclass of workers who now have to travel farther and farther just to earn a paycheck. Places like Atlanta arent exactly known for being accommodating to such workers either. And in fact the social services in those areas are almost undoubtedly worse than places like San Francisco. While housing prices are certainly a strong influence on peoples decisions to move theyre not the only factor. There would still be a trend toward knowledge transfer because places like Atlanta and Charlotte have lower cost of living overall better weather etc.  NIMBYs arent confined to the coasts. Those cities get all the attention but it is often just as difficult to build urbanist developments in the South and Rust Belt  if not more so at times since those places are extremely autodependent and thus reflexively against parking reforms etc..So places like Atlanta and Austin may have growing populations and economies but theyre also choking on traffic and sprawl. This state of affairs should not be celebrated. Maybe the influx of displaced coastals will move things in a different direction politically but that will be a slow process if it occurs at all.

So at the moment they need to charge more than  Eurocents per minute which is not exactly cheap if you want to use it regularly e.g. for commuting. In my city you would get a monthly ticket for public transport for the price of  Cargo minutes per workday. Also the serviced area and the choice of serviced cities in general is rather small because they need a certain density to get a good utilisation and some dropoffs cost an extra service charge.

And yet at the same time I went to Barcelona and had a great time with my hosts and became friends with them and experienced the city in a way that a hotelhostel would not compare. They and other hosts have said that they rent out their places when out of town or otherwise and it helps to pay the bills. But again some get more than the rent they pay and if thats the case then the landlord will get wind and do the same. Hence the regulations. And that airbnb is fighting these regulations seems odd to me.

9815002,0,t3_5frm0g,I too think that is very depressing to live in one of those places from having lived in a place like that for a short period and generally being aware of them in western Germany where these urban areas came from the post war reconstruction period.These places are incredibly monotonous cheap coarse unrefined ugly and boring and hated by many. Modern architecture has a bad reputation among the general public in Germany probably because of these places. They were created to supply cheap aparments and they do but they dont do much more. They dont seem to ever have a soul or some kind of character.Although density is quite good there arent many shopping opportunities often only a supermarket once in a while. Although some places have malls. For instance the Nordwestzentrum in Frankfurt which looks quite interesting from above.These places are on the outskirts of cities. Many people drive so there are cars everywhere. But transit connections are often are an integral part in large developments and usually lead into the city center with service being quite good often light rail is used. These places are apartmentfarms and everyone leaves for the day. Except pupils maybe they go to huge schools complexes.Green space between these buildings often does not provide a pleasant experience it is shared with too many people to be private and also open to the street but often fenced and definetly not public. Also youre directly under the windows of the ground floor tenants. This space is almost never used so it would be no loss building something on it.I dont think that it would be possible to just knock these buildings down unfortunately that would be quite unsustainable too. Maybe if one is in bad shape it can be replaced with something better to slowly refurbish a neighborhood.You could connect these line shaped buildings and create new streets to create a classic european perimeter block you just need to find someone who actually wants to create new living space in these areas. I think generally filling in some of the space between buildings and making it possible to work and shop there would be the way to go. And I think that it would be important to also create more luxurious aparments and townhouses to be appealing to wealthier people otherwise people that begin to earn more will want to leave this place forever making it a place for the lesswealthy.

Second yes Houston has a bunch of common by which I mean exists everywhere bad policies that requires concrete and subsidizes driving but at least Houston allows people to build new shit. Yes much of it is suburbia just as it is everywhere else except everywhere else only lets it happen in suburbia.

Now days we put the polluting energy production far away and run many of these services off electricity.We have building codes taking care of fire safety and how they spread we have sprinkler systems.

11100750,0,t1_deq6fu7,Ive yet to read the book but the most important idea is that cities are the bastion of inequality and segregation which almost always falls along racial lines even when they are supposedly liberal havens.The issue stems from economically disadvantaged people not having a say in the developments that occur in their neighborhoods which displace them through urban renewal or more subtle means I.E. gradual gentrification. Look at what is currently happening in Detroit for the best example during the citya bankruptcy which was concurrent with the city being run by an EFM essentially stripping power from elected officials also appointed by Governor Snyder the same one accussed of poisoning Flint used taxpayer money to build a hockey stadium for a billionaire on land that was sold for a dollar in a deal in which the city will not collect any further tax revenue. So Detroit tax payers are footing the bill on a private project which will have no appreciable benefit to the average resident. most Detroiters simply cant afford Red Wings games most Detroiters dont even follow the Red Wings and the city is sorely lacking in many of the basic anemities that constitute a functioning balanced city.It should be stated that many long time businesses and residents who have stuck through Detroits most turbulent years were SOL when the deal occurred. So while the Cass Corridor is nicer since the changes began the feel of the neighborhood is completely changed and the underlying problems that made the mess in the first place have been swept under the rug instead of actually addressed in any meaningful way. So the Cass CorridorMidtown has weekend shoppers and restaurants today whereas ten  years ago it had crackheads and shooting galleries the problems that concentrated poverty vagrancy drug use and violence still remain. I would be a hypocrite if I said certain residents belong here more than others but that isnt the point. It is quite ironic that in Americas blackest city long time residents suddenly feel unwelcome and in some cases are excluded because they are black. And you may not want to hear it but it is simply a truth of what is happening here in Detroit. The truth is we are still terrible at integrating cities and the discussion on gentrification stems from our focus solely on economic and profit based developments. There is a quote from the article that says gentrification is easy and I believe that is the most prescient idea in the article  to actually tackle Detroits school system public transit poverty segregation suburban sprawl etc. all of which are contributors to the current trend of gentrification will take years decades even of really tough introspection and societal work to start to fix.ETA I appreciate your input on this topic as its one I feel very strongly about as a resident of Detroit still trying to navigate the insanity that is our current situation. Its a really tough topic because when i talk about gentrification I am talking about myself too.,urbanplanning,deq9dsj,5,t5_2qhp7

11423613,0,t1_dfqipue,Wow. gtThe taxes interest and maintenance are not lost they are essential to maintaining ownership and maintaining value.And rent is essential to maintaining a place to live. The point is that its money out of your pocket that youll never see again just like rent. gtIf you are renting and you choose to move you only get your security deposit maybe. If you own a home and choose to move you get money from the sale.If you own a home and move you have thousands of dollars in costs. When you buy a home you have thousands of dollars in cost. Unlike a deposit you dont get that money back. And then you still have to pay interest insurance taxes maintenance and maybe HOA fees. Contrary to what you might think buying and selling a home is not free. And when you rent you can keep that down payment liquid so you dont even have to move to get that money back. You still have it. gtPeople who rent have littletono collateral which means they are less likely to take entrepreneurial risks and less likely to have someone take a chance on them. Owning a home often means youre tied down to an area unless youre willing to take a loss when you sell. When you rent you can do whatever the hell you want and only have to sacrifice the deposit. Good luck doing whatever the hell you want when you have your life savings tied up in an illiquid asset. Renting easily provides people the most freedom to take risks. gtWhat it comes down to with rent vs ownership is preference. Well yeah. Point is that buying a home is often the wrong financial decision. If you want to buy a home for other reasons go for it. But please dont do it because renting is throwing money away. Thats just simply wrong and ridiculous. ,urbanplanning,dfqusny,2,t5_2qhp7
