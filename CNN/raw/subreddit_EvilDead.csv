9088426,0,t1_d849lva,You have to have a fan base to post your short film to first. If I posted a short film now and tried promoting it that would be considerably harder than getting some fans gradually and then posting a short film that they could help promote as well. Thanks for your response appreciative of anyone whos willing to at least check the post,EvilDead,d84a604,1,t5_2sghx
