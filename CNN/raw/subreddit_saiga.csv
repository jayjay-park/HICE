1188346,0,t3_27npwg,Also pro tip take a few pictures of the bolt with the dust cover off before you take it apart for cleaning the first time. Reassembly can be a bit tricky the first time you do it. Youll want to know exactly how the bolt was arranged so that you can get the lugs in the right place when you put it back together. ,saiga,ci3b39c,3,t5_2t9z2
1388821,0,t3_29ahqk,Awesome job man Looks almost exactly my like build.  I took opted to take off the gas block and front sight though just for the cleaning rod.  Did it without a press too.  Looks good though nice job.,saiga,ciqdck8,1,t5_2t9z2
1828610,0,t1_ck9hgpl,Idk about you but saiga handguards suck if you handed me an imported handguard and Krebs handguard you bet your ass off Ill choose Krebs. ,saiga,ck9jfvy,1,t5_2t9z2

2619628,0,t1_cn0e70y,Thats just it I thought this was one of the higher quality AKs out there. I would most likely replace the stock furniture because in all honesty I think the wood looks a lot better than plastic on the AK. Unless I go and buy a completely US made AK which kinda defeats the purpose of buying one. I have looked around and all the other AKs out there seem to be of cheaper manufacture. ,saiga,cn0ium8,1,t5_2t9z2
3414424,0,t1_cp0zq43,When they were in stock they were . The day they went out of stock they dropped the price down to . Bit of a dirty trick IMO unless they keep it that low when they come back in stock.,saiga,cphgw4y,1,t5_2t9z2
3821891,0,t1_cqppf9r,CA resident with an unconverted saiga. I dont think Tapco makes a trigger for our guns as they stand. They would need to be converted which I also dont want to do. About two months ago I posted a question here and got a great response. Perhaps it will help you. ,saiga,cqrxei1,1,t5_2t9z2
6023017,0,t3_3xwpwc,I bought this exact gun two weeks ago from a local dealer. It was approximately  out the door. Ive done a few mods to it in the past few weeks... Magpul Zhukov extended handguard threaded barrel and added a muzzle break. Custom QD mount on the Phoenix Technologies Stock so I can use my Magpul MS sling. Houge over mould grip. Gonna add an RS regulate mount and a Aimpoint after the holidays. Its a great gun Ive put a couple hundred rounds through it already and it ran without a single issue. Feed ramp is installed security with what appears to be a dab of epoxy over the screw. Irons were dead on out of the box at  yards indoor range looking forward to testing it at  when I get a chance. Tapco single hook trigger is surprisingly great. This is my second Saiga. I few years back I bought an unconverted Saiga  from a gun show for something stupid cheap like . Traded it off in the summer of  for a CZ . Live and learn. Shoot me a PM if you want to see pictures or if you have any questions. ,saiga,cy9527r,2,t5_2t9z2

7586086,0,t3_4j7qlb,I dont know what you paid but solid find nonetheless. Ever since the sanction its been rough finding any much less ones thatve been converted already assuming the conversion was done well. Good stuff man. Have fun with your scary black rifle and hope we can get more in the future,saiga,d34i1o2,2,t5_2t9z2
8556901,0,t3_4wzef3,I added a wood front handguard without changing anything else forward of the receiver.,saiga,d6b6sae,1,t5_2t9z2
11453832,0,t3_633lsv,Im not from NY nor do I own an ak. I am in the process of getting a saiga  now though.This kind of a set up is legal. Or look into a monstermanhammerhead grip.Ive also seen where people put a cover thing over the pistol grip that closes the gap between the pistol grip and stock. I dont know what its called though. Apparently you can make one out of a type of plastic sheet. I saw a video where a guy did it. Ill see if I can find it.I doubt I helped you much but I figured Id give it a try. Edit something like this is legal from what I hear.  Make with kydex.Edit Protip  Do your damn research. I know not complying to r will never bite me in the ass but after doing some resarch I found out I will need to buy another  or so in parts just to be legal.  Had I known in advanced I wouldnt have bought the conversion kit yet. It would be smart to figure everything out before you waste time or money just in case. And one guy or one forum wont have all the answers. Its a confusing topic and most shooters arent lawyers and most lawyers dont shoot.,saiga,dfua7nq,1,t5_2t9z2
