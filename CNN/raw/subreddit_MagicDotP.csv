754432,0,t1_cgq113r,Yup Im hoping they can have the booster system alongside the preconstructed decks.  A truly open system of deckbuilding would make for a very interesting meta.I just got into the series last year but Ive been feening for the  iteration for a while now.,MagicDotP,cgq1ai7,2,t5_2x80r
1310513,0,t1_cih1eh0,Rom Toolbox even the free version will do pretty much everything you need it to but youll need to be rooted to access the directory where the data is stored. An ios user gave me his save file a while ago and it looks really similar but Ive been too lazy to compare it in a hey editor. The safe for us called P.profile and its stored in the directory datadataCom.stainlessgames.dfiles  on android. ,MagicDotP,cih1s4r,1,t5_2x80r
1392828,0,t3_29o7o8,When i first got dotp i didnt play the actual cards so i never picked up my scooze. Was hoping to get something equally valuable this time around to redeem for my mistake. unfortunately most of the soul cycle is pretty unplayable. ,MagicDotP,ciqvehz,1,t5_2x80r

1473809,0,t1_cj00orn,The premium cards arent even that good there is barely anything in there worth getting unless you really want to play Goblins,MagicDotP,cj10m56,1,t5_2x80r
1496853,0,t1_cj3v328,BoneWand is just sooooooo slow. Though I dont like Soul of Ravnic either.,MagicDotP,cj3wlom,1,t5_2x80r
1499122,0,t3_2bckq4,Im playing a version of this without spiders. Have a few Ulcerate to stale along with Elvish Visionary to draw. Its worked out so far. My mana curve is a little lower but I still have loads of fat cards. Really fun to play but can be crushed by most token decks if you cant get the land early. Also maybe try out Soul of Zendikar. Even if you dont play him and he ends up in your graveyard you can get a  out of him in a bind.This guy was not happy.,MagicDotP,cj46tk2,1,t5_2x80r
1533458,0,t3_2brsfi,maybe he is just that good,MagicDotP,cj8hu5v,2,t5_2x80r
1548179,0,t1_cj9gve5,Interesting. Can you elaborate?,MagicDotP,cjac61w,3,t5_2x80r
1588875,0,t3_2cgg7n,I dont know about the Xbox version but I got the achievement on steam from a game where they ragequit so youre probably closer than you think!,MagicDotP,cjfg68u,1,t5_2x80r
1622171,0,t3_2cvtvx,A few ideas off the top of my head lands is very low for what looks like a very slow controlling deck especially if youre intending on winning off a sphinxbone wand and then chaining draw spells.That said does sphinxbone wand do much for you? I havent actually tried it but it looks like a mana donothing to me.Splashing for mana fixing the cultivates seems odd even if it is acceleration too. There are no other green cards in the deck! I dont know if we want green in here at all? If we really want the ramp darksteel ingot is a bit worse but doesnt require you to completely build your manabase around it. If it were me Id cut green completely plus the SphinxBone Wands and the Ior Ruin Expeditions. It might be a completely different deck at that point though. Id add some more lands the second archangel and some number of Skymark Roc and the UU counterspell for creatures the name evades me.,MagicDotP,cjjn26p,3,t5_2x80r
1636954,0,t3_2d1u59,Basically any deck can get a  turn kill so I find this kind of pointless.,MagicDotP,cjli41e,3,t5_2x80r
2454621,0,t3_2nkkzr,Its random what pack you get regardless if the player is replaced by AI.  As you fill up your collection the odds of getting battle boosters will go up.,MagicDotP,cmf3dqs,1,t5_2x80r
3231925,0,t1_cowxpxy,you should have a loading thingy in the middle called matchmaking if you dont have that it will not look for players. if you cant get it to work i recommend you to just join games instead of creating them.,MagicDotP,cowztd5,1,t5_2x80r
3572603,0,t3_316d41,This seems like the most annoying deck to play against. Good stuff.,MagicDotP,cpzi693,1,t5_2x80r
3609218,0,t1_cq3o3o6,Yeah I hope so too. They could just implement an ELO system instead of having to completely screw over the gameplay.,MagicDotP,cq3odws,1,t5_2x80r
3609337,0,t1_cq3ndoa,Do you want to see a guaranteed Rabblemaster on turn  a baneslayer when you opponent plays his th land?   Im just gonna say it.  This is how the game should have been when it first came out.   would have made the game easier to collect and made for a larger variety in cards that would see play.,MagicDotP,cq3ovkk,4,t5_2x80r
3750861,0,t3_33d2f1,You get your starter deck and to get more decks you have to play the game and get more cards.  You cant choose new colors again unless you delete the Duels folder.,MagicDotP,cqjtobf,3,t5_2x80r
3794617,0,t1_cqoddcy,Thats fine by me because I love GreenWhite. Which starting deck is best for zombies?,MagicDotP,cqotf2s,1,t5_2x80r
3970942,0,t3_34bygp,One thing I dont like about card targeting is that the game sometimes picks my own cards when I play a card saying destroy this card or banish this card.  If Im not careful Ill take out my own creature.  That should not be the first option it chooses.,MagicDotP,cr8x5df,1,t5_2x80r
4003596,0,t3_36avl5,This looks good Im interested to try it. My only initial question is regarding the large amount of nonbasic lands. You may have more luck with basic lands that dont tap when they ETB. I realize the deck is suited to mid and lategame wins but it would probably fare better against quick aggro with basic lands. Maybe  basic lands and  Guildgates instead of  and ? A gradual increase test would inform the situation. Ill try it myself Im aware that limits your options a bit but I feel like the advantages would outweigh the negatives.,MagicDotP,crcn3dn,1,t5_2x80r
4304944,0,t3_39pizb,Nothing specific for fun decks but I like those that run Warstorm Surge Sphinx Bone Wand or Warp World.,MagicDotP,csaw4w2,1,t5_2x80r
4703667,0,t3_3d4vhj,I finally got past it after drawing  destroy targets to and a sorcery to pull his Wurm from graveyard with morbid   then it was over after that. But it took quite a few draws to get the optimum hand to handle his curve.,MagicDotP,ctnfnmy,1,t5_2x80r
