888762,0,t3_24auj6,HeyaNot a professional linguistic just a native speaker but Ill try and help.  First about  thats a pretty straightforward possessive word. Onewatts car can be easily translated to    the first and third words of that sentence being car and Onewatt the order of nouns is different but thats digressing too much anyway. This word may be conjugated   Mine   yours   his and so forth.  Now about that Chinese character of yours thats a pretty interesting question. I dont believe based on my very limited linguistic knowledge that theres any literal translation of that character in Hebrew. However something did strike familiar.  Hebrew as well as other Semite languages has a peculiar concept that is called Construct state or . I know about this concept merely because Im naturally familiar with the way it works so I dont know how well Id be able to explain its intricacies Im sure Wikipedia will do a much better job. However please feel free to ask me any questions you may have about it and Ill answer to the best of my abilities.  Thank you for a question which made me think a little. Im rather fond of that ,hebrew,ch5b0mq,8,t5_2rk3f

1602595,0,t1_cjh22po,Its not a name its a verb meaning to cry out cf. Psalms  conjugated in the archaicpoetical doubleconstruction consisting of the infinitive followed by the verb cf.   in the next line. Thus the literal translation of    is a crying shall our heart cry.In general this sort of poeticalliterary Hebrew may be rather difficult to follow if youre not used to it but its not an uncommon style for epitaphs especially those that like this one employ an acrostic poem to spell out the initials of the deceased and to answer your question in the OP yes I have seen similar epitaphs to this one before.,hebrew,cjh6ckv,4,t5_2rk3f

2186545,0,t1_clho214,Further research the term dates back to Mandatory Palestine.There was a decree by the relevant authority that limited bread production to a single type to be supplied to the British military as well as to the general population.Later on after the State of Israel was declared it was still kept for some time under the regime of austerity.I believe the best translation is Standard Bread.sources  websites of two of Israels largest bakeries,hebrew,clhrh1t,3,t5_2rk3f
2265061,0,t1_clrkw1s,gt H for K and T for S.Im sorry this is incorrect.  Religious people say Hashem Elokeinu when not praying for example in recordings so that they can avoid saying a blessing for naught.  It has nothing to do with Ashkenazi pronunciation in fact Sfardim do it too though they often substitute amonai instead of Hashem for Adonai.  Theyll also say kah instead of Yah for example hallu kah instead of hallu Yah Elokim instead of Elohim and similar substitutions.  If you observe them in prayer they wont make these substitutions at all but if theyre just singing songs they will.,hebrew,clroj8e,3,t5_2rk3f

5591262,0,t1_cwq4cut,Im relatedly an American with an Israeli ashkenazi mother who developed an accent fairly close to hers so Im not totally sure how Israelis raised in Israel react to Mizrachi accents but I cant imagine it gets as much criticism as American accents.

6119107,0,t3_3y7vzz,Aleph and ayin arent pronounced differently in modern Israeli Hebrew.  They were pronounced differently in ancient Hebrew and still could be in liturgicalBiblical Hebrew in services and their Arabic counterparts still have that difference.  But the people who revived Hebrew as part of Zionism decided to make a number of simplifications to make the language more accessible.  Since only Sephardim who lived in Arab countries could pronounce a real ayin while the sound had mostly been lost among Ashkenazi Jews since European languages dont have that sound they decided not to included it in modern Hebrew.  So ayin just became another aleph for pronunciation.Though I do sometimes hear Mizrachi Israelis pronounce ayin it would be weird to hear other Israelis do it let alone EuropeanAmericanborn learners of Hebrew.  It would sound like theyre trying to affect a Mizrachi accent on purpose. This comment written someone born in Israel whose first name is spelled with an ayin  ,hebrew,cyl6gig,3,t5_2rk3f

6794091,0,t1_d0mc5xv,Dont worry about the niqqud We almost never use it on a daily basis. At some point you will learn to read words without it. Its something you get through experience not just learning so dont let it bother you.We dont have niqqud on keyboards and on phones so there is no point searching for it.The only place that I remember that we use normally niqqud is while praying.,hebrew,d0meez1,1,t5_2rk3f
