1342971,0,t1_cijk4vt,Its very pretty! I like the atticstyled kids room how did you make the ceiling look like that? and the master bedroom has a nice airy feel to it.,TheSimsBuilding,cikp76o,1,t5_31foo
1396895,0,t1_circw11,Its just more of a modern style of shotgun maybe railroad since you have a hallway.  I like it up on the stilts some where built that way due to low water tables.  Give you extra room as well. I like it! Its homey but classy as well.,TheSimsBuilding,cirdr3t,4,t5_31foo

1625119,0,t1_cjjzad0,Thank you so much!!!  There is a mix of both! The balcony couch was made of a sectional seating thingy that connects kind of like counters I think its from an expansion probably late night. It was in misc. seating! If youd like I can double check when I get home no problem The fireplace I believe is also an expansion I honestly freaked when I noticed it! Its so handsome huh! The master bedroom bed is FULL of CC lol!! The bed itself is as is the pillow duvet and bed skirt all separate pieces. I can get you DL links tonight as well if you like!!Thank you so much for the kind words!!!  Have a great evening!,TheSimsBuilding,cjk0flt,1,t5_31foo

1800735,0,t3_2f1zju,Hello. This is alecs with my other account. Just wondering about these challenges.. When do you release them? Are there prizes? Bragging rights? Lol. Are there other contests?Also thank you for your compliment about my build! It was a hard build. Built it up and demolished it about five times especially because of that basement lol. Ended up digging in the ground and just building normal walls to make a basement . Also I just realized that I didnt put  actual floors just the basic wood... oops,TheSimsBuilding,ck6513x,2,t5_31foo
