246468,0,t3_1uzbfp,The Adventures of Derrick Deckchair.  A crazy little thing called love.Thursday was going to be the big day and Derrick Deckchair could hardly wait for the excitement. The first anniversary he would be sharing with a real live person named Daisy! And he was going to make her feel like the special real live person she was by doing something really special for her. He was going to order for her a ton of flowers. They would cover almost her entire front porch! He would wait for her to leave for work in the morning watch her surprised reaction and then he would run up to her scoop her up in his arms and then he would take her to the park and they would go for a picnic work be damned and then they would go to a movie and... Oh Derrick could hardly wait!He ordered the deluge of flowers from a reputable flowerman who promised they would be delivered on Thursday morning at the crack of dawn.  Daniel made sure the flowerman was impressed with the gravity of the situation and got him to promise that the delivery would be done in absolute silence. Nothing is to go wrong! He shouted into his telephone. Dunnae worry lad the flowerman replied. Itll be done quicker and quieter than you can whisper the god damn English are coming. Derrick was relieved and he promised the man heaps of money if all went according to plan. After this Derrick went back to work selling accordions.  Wednesday flew by in a daze. People noticed the spring in his step the twinkle in his eyes and the general bounciness of his appendages. Even his boss remarked that he looked disturbingly gleeful but mumbled that he had at least sold a lot more accordions than usual. After work Derrick ran home on his bicycle to feed his fish. After feeding them he wondered if he should let Daisy know he was thinking about her and he thought about calling her. Telephone in hand he almost dialed her number but then reasoned that it would be an even bigger surprise if she thought he had forgotten their anniversary. The look on her face! Derrick spontaneously combusted in a fit of giggles. Not much later he went to bed still smiling.After a fitful night of not much sleep Derrick awoke to find the birds of song hailing the fresh new dawn with their melodious ejections. Derrick hurried to his pants and put them on. Afterwards he jumped out his door onto his bicycle and sped away to Daisys house. He got there right as the sun was shining its glorious rays over the horizon to find Daisys front porch covered in a veritable ocean of flowers as ordered. Now to wait... oh that damnably glorious restless strumming hum of excited anticipation! Then after a short while the front door creaked open and out came Daisy.She was talking on her mobile telephone seemingly oblivious to the flowery sea around her. Then as she turned to lock the door she noticed the petals  strewn about her feet. Just as she was about to mumble what the hell she heard a man shout her name. DAAAAAIIIISSSSSSSYYYYYYYYYYYY  he shouted. She turned around again to see an emaciated dark haired young man across the street shouting her name through a megaphone. Now the man threw away the megaphone and began running straight for her! Its our anniversary! he yelled. Do you like the flowers!? Daisy began rummaging in her bag for the can of mace her mom had given her last Christmas. But as the man jumped onto the front porch he immediately doubled over into a helpless sneezing fit at her feet. Daisy! he wheezed through sneezes and coughs adding not half as pretty ending with hatCHOO before collapsing. As the unconscious Derrick wheezed on Daisy decided not to mace the strange young man. Seeing however that festering boils were appearing on his nose and forehead she decided to dial .   When Derrick awoke he saw a doctor standing by his side. He found himself unable to move because he was strapped to the bed. Son the doctor said Ive got some good news and some bad news... Derrick nodded solemnly. The good news is that youre going to live. The bad news is that weve had to amputate your nose. Now were looking for a replacement but that might take a few years. Its not a good market for noses right now. I hope you understand that we did everything we could to help you. Derrick nodded as some tears rolled down his cheek. Now I know this is going to be hard but there is someone here who wants to see you. Are you up for it? Derrick nodded and in walked Daisy. At first she seemed scared to approach him. Then after composing herself she sat by his bed and began to speak Now I dont know you who you are or why you did what you did. I dont know if you believe what you said about an anniversary or me being pretty and all but in a weird way Im touched. The police who came asked me if I wanted to press charges but Im not gonna. To be honest this is one of the first times anyone has done something like this for me and it feels nice. They told me your name was Derrick? Derrick nodded. She continued Derrick and Daisy it has a nice ring to it but not sure if I want you to go all megaphone shouting crazy man on me again so lets set up some rules... So as it turns out Daisys father is a mobster who knows a guy who can nose a guy and they live happily ever after.         ,worststory,cf6as6t,6,t5_2wgat

How menacing was that? What did that even mean? Time will tell I guess.Guys Jimmy Smits huffed NYPD Detective Bobby Simone is a character I really connected with. And my car is essentially a cop car that was used in the show. In fact thats exactly what it is.The executives babbled and gabbled at one another. Eventually Witbanger spoke up.Weve come to an agreement that NYPD Blue isnt your best project and that it should probably be a Star Wars car so it can fly and stuff.Now if any regular man was in Jimmy Smits shoes they would have pooped themselves by now. But Jimmy Smits is a master of the art of improvisation. Nobody can be Jimmy Smits better than Jimmy Smits.Alright gimme like  seconds Jimmy yelped gregariously.

She sat in one corner slowly turning purple and making his tongue tickle at the rancid and furry taste of her body moulded from Gods dumpster behind the burger joint. But with every bite he new she nourished the brown eggs that would tear through his colon as he piled them one on top of the other into the shape of a baby. The baby eggs were getting wetter and more frequent and he was confused as to whether he should make the vomit part of Gods wish for a manpoobaby for now he was focused only on what came from him. Birth is painful and long and he guessed he only had six meals and a short waut until the transformation from mother to child through the father was complete.,worststory,cnvsy5o,1,t5_2wgat
