I Would do it again if I was going to college again. I enjoy partying sports girls and drinking so I fit in. The  sucked but I made really good friends and did things I wouldnt have done without it. The time commitment is just during pledging and as they say it is the best time I never want to do again  Odds are youll be one of a few Engineers in the frat unless you do one of the nerdier frats and one of the few frat guys in your classes.

Old Leonardtown the blue buildings further from campus behind the newer brick buildings usually consists of  person apartments. The layout of these varies but they all have two bathrooms and a large living space like  times the size of New Lenoardtown but the bedrooms are smaller.

2093413,0,t3_2ibvgr,Long post incomingI cant speak very well for basketball or football games since the majority of my game time in either is in the band itself but if youre willing to wait for spring theres a good opportunity for some great student cheering.Im not talking about lacrosse but about baseball. Starting last academic year weve formed a student section called the Backstop where we position ourselves behind the visitors dugout and heckle and harass the guy on deck and sometimes the pitcher as well. Theres usually anywhere between  of us per game so were not particularly loud but were hoping to get more and more as the team improves. We research the opposing teams general starting lineup and their social media and any other stuff we can find on themgirlfriends names Little League stats embarrassing moments in school etc. and attempt to get into their heads with it. Its a ton of fun to listen to. What I mean by that is well the others come up with that stuff. What I do is look up the jersey numbers of the likely starters and come up with numerical facts about them and the other numbers to contrast the more aggressive jeers and taunts the others provide. It gets the others hyped up whenever I do a particularly longwinded one. We even come up with names for the players stemming from these things I do. Triskaidecagon for  Three squared for  etc. We usually do Friday and Tuesday home games. For a considerably quieter more chill atmosphere go to a Saturday or Sunday game. Watch quality baseball up closeeven right behind the plate without any of the frills in the bigger sports besides things like betweeninning promotions and background music between plays. Chat with an opposing teams fan theyre usually very friendly. Remember In general Friday for the louder gamego ahead and join us if you like Saturday or Sunday for the quieter game. Midweek games vary. Last season we had the best season in UMD baseball history. We made the NCAA tournament for the first time since  beat powerhouse South Carolina on their home turf twice and went toetotoe with  ranked College World Series runnerup Virginia and were the only ones who dealt the Cavs besides the national champion Vanderbilt squad a loss in NCAA tournament play. We made it to the equivalent of the Sweet  and now were targets to teams across the nation and we need to keep up our enthusiasm to hopefully get a similar performance next Spring. Check us out! If you can get through a game. I hear lots find baseball boring but give us a chance. Hopefully you remember we exist when February rolls aroundTLDR For a more intimate relaxed game atmosphere give baseball a shot. On Fridays most Tuesdays and the occasional Saturday students show up to heckle the opposing team behind their dugout. Its like the baseball version of the Crew and considerably smaller.,UMD,cl5x3dy,1,t5_2rob8

2361592,0,t1_cm3ldl0,Those claims are quite anecdotal until you can put numbers to it from which I understand are skewed in the first place. And Im not trying to ignore the fact that sexual misconduct exists. It absolutely does it absolutely is a problem and it absolutely should be address but not in this fashion. I think what you mean is that the amount of reported sexual assaults is rising because I highly doubt people up and decided that they wanted to assault people more frequently because why not and yes this statement is also a little anecdotal. And yeah sure the law is the law. But there are a few things that are really off about this specific case  The sudden outcry is a little startling. What was the specific case that caused this to happen? Why do I still not know what it is? It kind of discredits the purpose of this survey first of all. The University wouldnt encroach on our freetime like this unless something seriously super serially serious happened refer to my rabbling about people not randomly deciding to start raping people. The word personal was used. She stated in writing that she will go out of her way to dole out punishment. As an administrative figurehead this woman just went from doing her job to making it personal. Very unprofessional very unsettling.  People are consistently crying women this women that about this debacle and it really isnt just about women although thats just a personal chit and it may not pertain to this situation. In addition I dont think its right to say that its arguably more important than anything if nothing is done at an earlier stage. When youre trying to educate a student body that has physically and mentally aged this far chances are you arent going to sway them to behave differently. Want to see change? Fix the kids. Give proper education to people lower down the educational ladder. Dont pay some old hack to push an agenda to punish the noncompliant. ,UMD,cm3lq9u,5,t5_2rob8

2387634,0,t3_2mr354,Sorry if the organization of this post is a little out of order Im not really up to it right now.  Since youre a physics major Id advise you come by the physics undergraduate lounge sometime during the day and ask people there.  Best hours are probably  or so.  Theres a fair number that are doubling in physics and comp sci some minoring in comp sci some just taking a few courses.  If youre in SPS the current webmaster and secretary are both Comp Sci majors.  MATH as you guessed is a good start to get a feel for using the mathematical side of MATLAB interacting with data displaying plots etc.  but it wont give you the background you would get in .   is geared towards people with no programming background.  That being said many people with some programming background still take it and generally set a high curve while having an easy time with the course.  Normally its a mediumdifficulty course IMHO.  Taking CMSC first means you wont be able to take  or .  They dont let you take  or  if youve declared a CS majorminor or have taken .  CMSC I believe is web programming.  It wont be all that useful for a physics major and the differences in the languages youd use there and languages you might use down the line in physics mean it wont be too helpful.  CMSC is C.  C is more useful for a physics major.  C is very useful for communicating with devices.  If you go into experimental physics or engineering odds are you will be using C a fair amount.  Personally in the long run I recommend doing  and .  Maybe  andor  if you enjoy it and want a stronger background.   and  teach you Java and the objectoriented features it has.  While you are less likely to use Java in physics Java is very similar to C Python Matlab etc. which you are more likely to use.  Its also not too difficult to learn as a first language.  Once youve learned Java or C the others are fairly easy to pick up.   The reverse isnt as easy because Python and MATLAB are fairly lax on syntax while Java and C are not but Python and MATLAB are a little easier to pickup to compensate.  Ill try and write some more a little later.  ,UMD,cm6ti85,1,t5_2rob8

I recommend CStone but thats a PepsiCoke debate for UMD students. Both bars have pretty good food. If you want a bar thats a bit more upscale head to Looneys on the other side of town which is probably closer to wherever youre tailgating. Be sure not to go to Town Hall. In terms of food Ratsies is the pizza place everyone loves to say has the worst pizza you wont find decent pizza outside of NJ so just lower your expectations now and send the message to your friends but its a CP staple and apparently its closing down next September so if you want the CP experience head there especially at  a.m. after the bars. Its also conveniently across the street from CStone and Bents. For the best pizza youll find head to Slices or Blaze which is really popular because it just opened. ,UMD,cmccbqs,7,t5_2rob8

The projects were chosen because they asked an important question that is of broad interest and the data that students work to gather will be of high enough quality to be published.

You need to give a contribution to have the right to purchase season tickets.Also the Iribe Building will be an estimated  million so try like th and then paying full face value of tickets at every game.Student fees can be increased and probably have in the past I dont know but they would have to be approved by SGA. Also enrollment effects revenue from student fees so possibly that changed but Im just guessing as to how those numbers could have changed.And yes legally there is a separate budget so you can take off the tin foil hat. That is what an auxiliary enterprise is. Facilites Management CRS Dining Services ResLife Libraries Health Center SGA. These are all selfsupports and operate off student fees and their own revenues. They are all mandatory so you cant just decide you dont use the gym and dont need CRS. These departments need stable channels of revenue. They also operate on budgets separate from the universitys operational budget which is funded through tuition. Athletics is nothing unique though.If youre really this interested in fees and where they go check out the Know Your Fees page or join an advisory board.

6655819,0,t1_d07qfcx,Thank you for your thoughtful response. I doubt that her choice of words were strategic but if they were I would say that it would be an interesting case of turnabout is fair play. Hold on to your hat now and I expect this comment to get downvoted to oblivion but here goes.Im afraid that this remains speculative since I havent heard the entire class recording so I am reconstructing what the pedagogical point of discussing ess and ette was which was my first comment. And I do agree that by the start of the clip things have clearly become tense. Since I havent heard what comes before I dont know what might have precipitated this. So lets proceed as if the point was ess and ette are uses of language that ultimately disrespect and disenfranchise women via  above. Then how can you get this point across so that your audience truly understands that effect? One way would be to turn the tables around in the discussion itself and use language that disrespects and disenfranchises such as young man and mansplaining. I doubt that I would have the presence of mind or the metacognitive facility to pull off such a switch in the moment. And I do agree with the point that this move did not achieve the right effect in this instanceto enlighten the student whether the choice of words was pedagogically intentional on the part of the instructor or not. That is the dramatic trick here would be to highlight by using offensive language the parallels between the uses of mansplaining young man ette and ess.If part of your question is how I would handle such a question in class then I would do pretty much the same as I did in my first comment above. That is spell out the argument again in excruciating detail. But I think an interesting if riskyjust look at the reactions here tactic is to demonstrate a parallel example in a way that resonates more strongly with the audience. And in this case since its about how disrespect and disenfranchisement are encoded in language choices resonating more strongly means making someone feel disrespect and disenfranchisement. But assuming that I was able to concoct such a dramatic demonstration on the spot then I would have stepped back to directly explain the parallelism between the use of young man mansplaining and ette  ess. But since I dont know who this instructor is Im in LING not HESP Im certain that Ive never had a discussion with them about pedagogical techniques.,UMD,d07rpkf,-41,t5_2rob8

Also increases in student worker pay is going to coincide with an increase in student fees to those departments. Im not opposed to it but youre ignoring half the picture.As to Lohs pay you need to understand that these things dont occur in a vacuum. University president pay is a different competitive labor market than student labor. If we dont pay competitively then they will go elsewhere and wed be worse off for it. There is no competitive labor market for president of the USA so youre comparing apples and oranges.

Hope it helps!Pro If you take a lot of classes along the mall or in the business school youre right next to class. I can roll out of bed five minutes before and still be there on time. Compared to a high rise dorm you dont see your RA too much. They have people on duty and they do rounds but you wont see them as much as you would if they were on your floor. Regarding laundry there is one facility housed in Hanford Hall for all of South Hill to use. I have yet to run into the issue of no washersdryers being open like I did in a high rise dorm. Also in my experience youre unlikely to hear your upstairsdownstairs neighbors unless they are making an effort to be heard.Con If youre looking to meet new people this isnt the place to do so. Most people on South Hill hang out with friends they made earlier on so you probably wont interact much with the people in your stack. Some suitesapartments hold up to eight people which can get hectic. Unless youre in Hanford Hall laundry is in a different building. All mail goes to Annapolis Hall which is a little off the quad. We also had issues with bugs but it wasnt totally out of control. Havent seen any since October or so. And finally to my knowledge all of the buildings on South Hill are older.

11325148,0,t1_dffnb82,Yes and no. It will allow you to take more classes sure. But there are some things to keep in mind. First if you are covering material faster you have less time to actually absorb and comprehend it. Theres a high chance for burnout. This isnt a criticism of your ability its just a common occurrence. Second faster pace means more work which means less time for internships or research. Thats what will end up getting you a job maybe directly through a connection maybe on your resume.Again it all depends on whether you want a STEM focused small hardcore studying environment or a more traditional campus. Both schools are well regarded so thats a nonissue.My recommendation is decide on a particular discipline youd like to follow either EE with a potential Chem minor or pure Chem with open avenues for other disciplines. Then research and compare both schools on the particular discipline you decide.As for how I know two sources a high school friend who went to WPI for Aerospace and several online reviews that corroborate his description.,UMD,dffoqhz,2,t5_2rob8

11370993,0,t3_6294dp,Cant answer anything about the class but I can answer your question about the W and summer tuition. Very few programs and employers will care about a single W. The vast majority wont care about a couple. Id venture to say most wont even ask for transcripts. I have two in the same semester on mine and my last interviewer brushed right past it. If they do ask explain it like you did here.As for the tuition you have to pay when you register but if you drop before the start of classes then you get a full refund. You could registerpay now and just drop after the final. It does take time for them to get the money back to you though usually  weeks. ,UMD,dfkvpsm,2,t5_2rob8

11690819,0,t3_66t5jq,Location. I dont know about you but I came from a small town in Ohio. While some schools would have given me a perfectly fine education for much cheaper Ohio doesnt have much to offer when it comes to what I want to do after college.I also really liked the idea of going to a place where I knew exactly zero people and starting over instead of having high school part two. It wasnt hard to make friends if thats something youre worried about. Overall I think I made the right choice. I dont know what you plan to study but the programs here are pretty great and a degree from Maryland should get you closer to the job you want. Its expensive but you could try to get external scholarships if your grades are good enough. ,UMD,dgl67py,7,t5_2rob8
