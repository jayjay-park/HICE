6039833,0,t3_3ppg98,I know its late but I found this thread through google while trying to find out stuff.You only need one mystical flower to make some floral fertilizer of that color. Plant the flower then bonemeal it to turn it into a tall flower use shears to harvest and youll get enough petals to make more fertilizer.,Blightfall,cybc0e8,3,t5_39qbt
7866265,0,t1_d403t5v,So I actually did manage to find the site I was looking for listing where to find all the foods Blightfall has available...It doesnt actually say anything about glowshrooms after all. Which is unfortunate. Having those in couldve given us a way to breed those imps you can sometimes get from animal bags! P,Blightfall,d408o9k,1,t5_39qbt

10041329,0,t3_5j4zvu,It seems to be spread across a couple parts.First of all youve got Dawnmachine.zs in the scripts folder this is the thing that programs all the research in the thaumonomicon.  Not strictly necessary but without it youd be stuck cheating in all the stuff.  For the jar file itself my best guess is reqcredit...jar .  That one seems to have the assets and code for all the blightbuster stuff inside it judging from the zippedup files Im not exactly gonna take a look into the code itself my java is so damn rusty...You might also need purplepanic.jar and notimefix.jar those seem to be posthoc bugfixes.  You may also need blightcore... But if you do youre gonna run into some interesting stuff because blightcore seems to be the thing that taints the world and has the quests in it.  From the look of things it may be possible to put blightbuster stuff in your game... at the cost of essentially making your world into a broken blightfall map covered in taint P,Blightfall,dbgett5,1,t5_39qbt
