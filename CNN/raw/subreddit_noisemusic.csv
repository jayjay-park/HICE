2858176,0,t1_cnsy33f,I thought the audio quality was awesome. If it was phone quality then it leant to the feel of the album.I noticed the loop effect  my impression was that you had cut these cassettes into like  inch loops or something and just looped them forever and added processingeffects to them. Using a loop pedal makes much more sense.I really enjoyed them!,noisemusic,cnsz48w,1,t5_2rh9y

8409253,0,t3_4urr6k,Boredoms Vision Creation Newsun is absolutely ecstatic. I think it can be more difficult to express certain emotions like happiness without tonal elements though. So it depends on what you consider noise but definitely despite the overt nihilism the No Wave scene has produced a lot of music that seems happy or playful. Also you find a lot more playful noise in musique concrte formal composition. Also I honestly find a lot of the Incapacitants stuff fun. It just feels like in the process of trying to remove intention from sound they end up just letting themselves go and making noise that expresses emotions. ,noisemusic,d5sp9t4,5,t5_2rh9y
