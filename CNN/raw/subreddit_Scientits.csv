10500385,0,t3_5qcvnc,I work on mouse models. Starting off you do need to be comfortable with the morality of it. Getting comfortable handling and doing other techniques with them will come with practice but as the other user said being confident with them helps a lot. I find that I make the most mistakes when I hesitate with them. None of us who do these experiments like what were doing to them we just try to keep our mind on the end goal and be as respectful as possible and adhere strictly to ethical guidelines. If there are particular things youre not comfortable doing it might be okay to get help with those. For instance I dont gavage my own mice and if I have to euthanise them using gas I try not to watch before they become unconscious or I get someone else to do cervical dislocation. Your enjoyment with rodent models might also depend on your actual model and your resources. My mouse trials are long and require a lot of work and I dont get much help so they can be pretty awful. Also Im not sure if there are rat breeds with behavioural issues but my mouse breed are psychos so I have to constantly avoid being bitten. ,Scientits,dcybvg7,6,t5_3enfp

10913994,0,t1_de5o32d,Former lab tech turned lab manager in academia here no longer in academia for better or for worse.  I gained most of my experience in the lab with the same group at first grad students and post docs but as new people came on board over the years some with advanced degrees MDPhD bridled at being told what to do by someone he viewed as inferior.  I had to go to my PI at some points and ask for backup.  He ended up reinforcing that I was second in command and had some authority.  This person wasnt treating me with respect and I called bullshit.  Having talked to others who have been in similar positions the support of your PI is really important.  Management courses could help but I would definitely say having the support of your managers is key.  Short of asking everyone to treat people with respect which is just you know basic courtesy but still sometimes needed.,Scientits,de5p8y9,15,t5_3enfp
