1209525,0,t3_27mj99,A second vote for Camon Sushi!  But it is really expensive for what it is.  Not nearly as good as some of the sushi in New England but still the best in Columbia.  Another really good spot is Saky on Fort Jackson Blvd.  Its also quite expensive but is very good for sushi in Columbia.,ColumbiYEAH,ci5oudk,1,t5_2scbs

4348322,0,t1_csfjk83,Hes a dead asshole and his kids arent nearly as bad.  In fact they arent even racists.  However Maurices is about the tenth best BBQ in town. Goatfeathers is closed now RIP. For BBQ if you want to stay in the downtown area I recommend True BBQ in West Columba might be Cayce.   Bar wise Check out the Whig right accross Gervais St. from the capital.  Definitely second the tubing.  Its lots of fun.  You can rent a tube and spot on the shuttle right by the base of the Gervais St bridge on the west Columbia side. ,ColumbiYEAH,csfsdf9,7,t5_2scbs
