6750927,0,t3_481kqu,I cant find the link but SCG had an article about nonLED dredge.The basics was that Dredge existed for a long time before people started putting the LEDFaithless looting engine in.Look to earlier lists for inspiration and maybe just add some Tireless Tribe.,MTGDredge,d0hlpo0,1,t5_3ccrw
8525092,0,t3_4wgxia,Infect is a really really bad matchup in my experience and its a solid portion of the metagame so I would definitely pack  dark blasts. Ancient grudge is phenomenal and I would say minimum . Gnaw to the bone wins races singlehandedly and I like . Golgari charm beats anger of the gods and kills rest in peace I run three but I could see . The next  or so slots are mostly cards Ive been messing around with. If you want asymmetrical grave hate I prefer Bojuka bog because of its synergy with Life from the Loam. I play thought seize but its been ok for the most part. Creature removal tends to come in lightning axe or vengeful Pharaoh.  Sorry for the wall of text lol ,MTGDredge,d6776cc,3,t5_3ccrw
9242921,0,t1_d8njhba,No thoughtseize but  collective brutalitys main which dont help too much against cagerip. But yea it seems  decays are a good balance against unknown boarding. ,MTGDredge,d8nlvl1,1,t5_3ccrw
