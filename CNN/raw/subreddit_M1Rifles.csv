4808051,0,t1_cu0i349,My .  You can include a note with your order asking for a specific mfgr or year and they will usually do their best to accommodate you.   If youre not planning on shooting matches a Service Grade will probably serve you well.To give you an idea of what you may get with a service grade I will tell you a little bit about mine.I have a service grade Springfield that was made in  and went through Leaderkenny in .  It is all Springfield except for the bolt which is HRA.  The barrel METE came in at    The stock is a new CMP one I have been working BLO into it for a while and its starting to darkenup nicely and has no marks except the CMP cartouche.  As far as accuracy goes If I do may part correctly at  yards it can produce groups that would fit inside the diameter of a can of soda.Personally I would advise you to go for a service grade rifle and spend the money you will save on ammo and go shoot the snot out of it.  ,M1Rifles,cu0leqa,5,t5_2wi5u
