1030990,0,t3_25usti,Well it shouldnt have but BnEs latest album disappointed me a bit. Theyve always worn a backpack but god damn give me some realness in there somewhere. Every song followed a formula and that was saddening and I also found they are really starting to repeat their words these days. Some songs were better than others. They are backed by some of the best instrumentals Ive ever heard but they often didnt do them justice. Having said that House of dreams was one of the best aussie hip hop songs Ive heard in a while. Sunshine was a fucking killer of an instrumental that was let down by Eso and only really held together by the second half of Blisss verse. Pale blue dot was mastered wrong and the voices were quiet compared to the rest of the album why?. Esos verse in Home is where the heart is was pathetic abc rhymes and lazy writing. The absolute biggest disappointment which left the worst taste in my mouth was Resovior dogs. I mean fucking god damn how do you fuck that up? You have some of the best talent Australia has to offer and this is what you come out with? Are you joking?  bar verse are a fucking joke. I was expecting a god damn posse track the kind of track that makes amateurs write reply verses and songs. I was gearing up for the kind of track that makes you want to fight bears and eat glass. What did we get? A fucking instrumental that sounds like its from some b grade tv show in the s and  bar verses with boring ass lines.Having said that I did enjoy the album. I am somebody Act your age and House of dreams are all incredible tracks. I think the half baked content with fully baked production was why the low quality was such a disappointment. I just feel like these boys arent hungry anymore. ,AussieHipHop,chlh8y3,2,t5_2sznf

2959293,0,t1_co4h9ow,What I remember from it is that it sort of  part in the one songFirst part being that its talking about the history of Mary Gilmore and how she taught at Broken Hill and then went to Argentina and came back and how she mightnt have liked the fact shes on the  dollar note being such a radical socialist.So annoying how I just cant remember it,AussieHipHop,co4hi7a,2,t5_2sznf

9705302,0,t3_5e3hav,Honestly he took a while to grow on me. Hes a better battle rapper than his albums would indicate. Hes one of the few Australian rappers that actually changes up his flow occasionally which is nice as most just stick to the tried and true Hilltop flow. Hes also a million times better than his label boss Fortay imo. Shit he at least tries a triplet flow here ,AussieHipHop,da9dxdf,7,t5_2sznf
