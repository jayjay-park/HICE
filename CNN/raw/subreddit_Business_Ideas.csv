Do some heavy marketing and really push on social media I bet this will be one of those things that will need to take off... but once it does... OH BOY!,Business_Ideas,cv6r822,1,t5_2wk90

6435702,0,t3_43tndx,Sometimes while doing a BP you improve your knowledge about how your business is.gt Noone reads it!False. Any investor or people who might be interested in your business will want to read your BP in order to know how much you know your clients and other important stuff how are you going to grow up if needed for example.gt What can you plan if you dont know yet whether there is a business in the first place?Its pretty obvious that doing a BP without even an MVP even if it has poor design is time wasted. I think that BP should be written in parallel with your product at least in the beginning.gt Writing a business plan eats up valuable time often weeks and months you should repurpose for more sensible tasks like talking to potential customers.There can be time for both tasks they are not incompatible. But you have to prioritize one of them. Maybe talking with your potential customers has higher priority.gt A business plan document forces you to write nice sentences craft coherent stories and worry more about form than content or even action.Thats not exactly true. Every BP doesnt need to have thousand of pages just the important information and directly to the point.gt Youre more likely to fire your staff than to fire your business modelThat can be true in some circunstances but it depends on how you are.gt You ignore realityFalse. Doing a BP makes you discover some things that customers cant tell you directly. A BP reflects a birdeye perspective of your business.Im not a big fan of BPs but I have to recognize that writting one Id written two taught me a lot about and if you combine a BP with real activity results can be amazing.,Business_Ideas,czkzmxo,1,t5_2wk90
