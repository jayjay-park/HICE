11309232,0,t3_617ulm,Mr President  My question is for the Labor Senator uimagreatspeeler .   Last term the Labor party voted against and ultimately ended the introduction of Same Sex Marriage. It is clear that had Labor supported the Coalitions legislation SSM would be real today.   Will the Senator inform the Senate whether his party intends to introduce or support legislation to allow same sex marriage in either house in light of the fact that the labor party voted against this legislation in the previous government and if so was the partys previous stance simply and attempt to nab the credit for its introduction?   ,AustraliaSimSenate,dfdvuer,2,t5_3jhfm
