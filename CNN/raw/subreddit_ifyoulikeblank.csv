They were the brainchild of a Jake Shillingford who had ambition though his voice could not compete with Mr Hannons. Nonetheless it fits with the Brit singers of the time. Nor can I say their songs have the consistent power of DivCos nor the ironic wit of Pulps but they have their moments. Start with the Golden Mile album.

1681082,0,t3_2djznj,The Trickster is a character in Supernatural. He only appears in a few episodes but they count among the funniest and most entertaining of the series. And of course theres Lucifer who plays the long game of the series... and the demon Crowley perhaps the greatest conniver in the entire show... certainly the most fun.Thing is you can find similar characters in many many shows movies etc. Its impossible to list all of em. So Ill just mention some of my favorites.Damages  The st season is excellent. Glenn Close does fine work as the diabolical Patty Hewes who is masterful at manipulating people to get what she wants. Her complex scheme unfolds beautifully though not without complications.Lost  A show full of wicked schemers from minor characters such as Lockes father to fanfavorite Ben Linus to a certain Big Bad whom I will not name here. Its a bit disjointed by the end but still a very worthwhile watch.Alias  Arvin Sloane is a fantastic villain with many contradictory attributes genteel fatherly erudite Machiavellian and utterly ruthless. He skillfully lies manipulates betrays traps and murders throughout the series and its quite fun to watch. There are many other tricksters on the show but Sloane is the greatest.The XFiles  The Cigarette Smoking Man. Trust no one.Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex  The Laughing Man in season  Kazundo Goda in season .White Collar Leverage Burn Notice  Shows where the tricksters are the good guys.

2187050,0,t3_2k3bds,Waking the Dead is a pretty character dynamic cold case investigation series. The character of Peter Boyd is just fascinating to me. He has an occasionally explosive temper and is quite impatient but he also has a deep sense of empathy and really only wants his team to be the best they can be. And the team itself doesnt always see eye to eye. My favorite scenes are when they get together to discuss the case and work out theories together. It is usually very raw with people talking over each other running sentences one into another starting and stoping getting sidetracked. Wire in The Blood is another British crime show this time following a clinical psychologist who helps the police investigate serial crime. The show has a relatively dark and bleak atmosphere with the relationship between the head of the unit Carol Jordan and the psychologist Tony Hill taking center stage. Similarly there is Touching Evil starring the same man Robson Green as in Wire in the Blood. The main character is back from extended medical leave after being shot in the head and the pilot episode has him decide to murder the main suspect although he finds though that someone beat him to it. The US version isnt bad either and stars Jeffrey Donovan from Burn Notice.Whitechapel is a pretty brilliant series that follows a on the rise Detective Inspector who is put in charge of a rough unit in the Whitechapel District. Unfortunately his first case seems to be a copycat of the Jack the Ripper murders. His constant battling with his second in command and the rest of the team is a highlight of the show. The show only gets more bleak and mysterious as the series continue.Tom Thorne Sleepyhead and Scaredy Cat is a decent double miniseries unfortunately that is all that was made of the series so far and the first one Sleepyhead really explores the relationship between the detective Thorne and the ME Hendricks who who seem to share a recent dark past.Murphys Law follows a haunted police officer who is brought back after an extended psychological leave to do dangerous undercover work. James Nesbitt really holds the show together as the titular detective.It seems you enjoy some escapism but not all escapism so I will suggest this next one but take this suggestion with a heavy grain of salt. New Tricks is a pretty over the top and generally silly British cold case investigation series but at times it has real heart and takes heavy turns into more serious fare.  It concerns former police officersdetectives who are brought back as specialized consultants on cold cases. Each character has their own troubled past ones wife was killed by hit and run one had accusations of corruption follow his whole career and the last was forced out after being blamed for the death of a prisoner. It really is the resolution to the character arcs that I find most and feel you might find interesting.DaVincis Inquest follows a Vancouver Coroner who searches for truth in a wide variety of cases that often fall through the cracks of the justice system. He has made many enemies and many mistakes over the years which make an already difficult job even more difficult. Unlike most procedurals there are a good number of cases that dont get happily solved or even solved at all.ReGenesis is a great medical mystery show following a group of doctors and researchers who study infectious diseases and help prevent and address outbreaks. It focuses on a brilliant but jerkass molecular biologist who runs the team and follows his life quite a bit.Since you relatively loved house definitely check out the British series Doc Martin starring an equally irascible Doctor who is forced to quit his well respected and high powered job as a physician due to a new found fear of blood which he tries to keep secret. He ends up taking a position as a general practitioner in a seaside country village. Unfortunately you might find it a bit too soap operay. Hopefully the delectable acting will keep you around.,ifyoulikeblank,clhts6e,2,t5_2sekf

Ah how to put it...Most of the music I like has something that really stands out to me or something that seems very unique or perhaps something that snaps my attention back to it. I am quite varied in what exactly it is that can do that but it is something important to me. Im not doing a great job of explaining but then you probably dont care much anyway. Still if you are actually interested I could give examples.Tame Impalas Elephant has something like that  the... I dont know what you call it... But the sound that follows the music throughout  I guess maybe the base? But its different than other base sounds to me... Edit I think its because it stays more in the foreground if you will of the music rather than falling to the background of the song... Thats the best way I can explain it... Im rambling. Point being Tame Impala stands out to me a bit more for that reason.The War on Drugs was about in the middle of the two for me. I didnt like them technically quite as much as Alvvays but they stood out a bit more.As far as the melody  tune or... whatever you call it again I dont actually know that much about music Beach House was probably my favorite.Thank you for the recommendations.

What I really like about both WTNV and OTGW is that they are both have an outsider a new character in a strange world. In Over the Garden Wall its Wirt and Greg who have wandered into the Unknown and in Night Vale its Carlos the scientist who has recently moved to the town. Unfortunately WTNV is not actually from Carloss point of view but from Cecil the radio hosts. Still Carlos gets a lot of attention in the podcast mainly because Cecil has a crush on him!. Anyways if you dont like Welcome to Night Vale I would also recommend Spirited Away a Studio Ghibli movie in which a young girl gets pulled into the Spirit World by accident and has to save her parents while working at a bathhouse for the spirits. Its really cool and if you enjoy that one movie there are plenty more by the same company that also have that sort of otherworldly feel to them. ,ifyoulikeblank,cnyqupl,1,t5_2sekf

That said a couple things you might check out Recettear has you managing an item shop instead of a farm but its a pretty cute game. On mobile you can get emulators that let you play the older Harvest Moon games. If you havent played the old GBA Friends of Mineral Town I highly recommend it.  Not out yet but Ive been following Wild Season which is inspired by HM. Sealark also not out yet seems somewhat similarly inspired though its focus is fishing not farming. If youre open to consoles I would highly recommend checking out Animal Crossing for DS and possibly the Atelier series PS as well.

It is very much in the film noir style but without the superficial film noir trappings found in films set in s Los Angeles.

3271306,0,t3_2xkqbr,Sounds like your dad would love Homicide Life on the Street Homicide is the show that gave David Simon the creator of The Wire his start on TV and he wrote several episodes of the series. Likewise a ton of actors from The Wire are also in Homicide.Homicide was one of the first if not the first police procedurals to show how detectives actually go about their cases. For example one entire episode in the first season is an interrogation between two detectives and a suspect where the detectives are trying to crack the suspect. Unlike the shows that preceded it Homicide often showed the bad guys going free and didnt embrace the melodrama that is featured in most procedurals. That gave the show a much darker tone and the direction which featured jump cuts and a gritty style filmed by  mm cameras followed and deepened the sense of brooding. The show starred top talent such as Andre Braugher for which he won the  Emmy for best actor in a drama series Ned Beatty Yaphet Kotto amp Melissa Leo and featured many other notable crew members. Plus you get to see the original weirdo detective John Munch who is much compelling in Homicide than he was on Law and Order SVU. This talent is utilized well and creates a lot of intriguing and fresh characters. Feel free to check out our sub and watchalong at rHomicideLOTS  were not very far in! Here are a pair of clips to get you a sense of how Homicide starts be warned there are some fairly drastic changes by the time the final season wraps upA great scene between  of the detectives from the pilot.Rookie detective Tim Bayliss at the scene of his first case a murdered  year old girl. ,ifyoulikeblank,cp15lr8,3,t5_2sekf

4034153,0,t3_36p6h1,I think Symphony X is prog metal with some power metal mixed in so those would be the genres to check out.  There are subreddits for both so you can always just browse rpowermetal and rprogmetal to see if anything catches your attention.Also Encylopaedia Metallum lists similar bands on its page for any band so its a good resource if youre looking for bands similar to a metal band you like.  Check out the similar artists tab on their page and do some Youtube searches to see if you find anything youre a fan of.Personally my own tastes lean more towards the power metal spectrum than Symphony X so youre likely to get better recommendations for prog metal from the resources I linked above although if you discover a love for power metal you can let me know and I can recommend some personal favorites.  But Ill throw Wuthering Heights out there as a band Im a fan of that combines prog and power metal and some folk heres a personal favorite thats on the proggier side Carpe Noctem  Blind Guardian and Savage Circus might also be good ones to check out.,ifyoulikeblank,crg4hc0,1,t5_2sekf

In a true dramatic tradition you cant literally write from the perspective of the antagonist without the antagonist becoming the protagonist. Do you mean stories where the antagonist from another story becomes the protagonist like Hector in Troilus and Cressida or the Wicked Witch of the West in Wicked? Or a story like Lolita where the view character is the bad guy?,ifyoulikeblank,d4ilayw,3,t5_2sekf

Dexter fits with the antihero theme in some of the shows you listed that you have watched and enjoyed.  I think the story arc designs for both shows fit fast consumption.    Beyond those I found House Lost and Fringe very entertaining.  I agree with uKJdkaslknv Lost and to a point Fringe need time to marinade to appreciate the storytelling.  And for me the opposite is true for House I felt the episode formula started to get stale when watching too much of it in a short period.  All of my recommendations except Six Feet Under do suffer from a drag season in my opinion though shows without one or two down seasons are few and far between.,ifyoulikeblank,d7g1aqp,3,t5_2sekf

9813231,0,t1_damaurf,Cant quite say it stands up to criticism though. My uncles take on it and Chomsky if anyones interestedgtIts one obnoxious statement after another. Like Chomsky trying to draw attention to himself hes got an agenda and cherrypicks facts to create a false perspective and ignores the context under which historical events occurred with the hope of conning youthful minds into believing that the US and Western Liberal Democracy and US and NATO foreign policies are as equally awful as the Soviet Union MarxistLeninism and Communist China. Somehow the Cold War was mostly the fault of US Imperialism what ever that was or is.gtSouth America has been mostly a mess for a few centuries not because of US intervention but because they are former Spanish and Portuguese colonies and inherited their corrupt murderous caste culture and society and governance from Spain and Portugal. The Argentina Junta didnt create the Dirty War to please Kissinger they did it to preserve their wealth and privilege the Spanish Way which unfortunately continues in bits and pieces today in most of South America and Southern Europe. The US created none of it.gtAnd this statement of Pilgers shit is really appalling and requires a highly warped sense of reality and criminal lack knowledge of just recent history.gt gtIn the last eighteen months the greatest buildup of military forces since World War Two  led by the United States  is taking place along Russias western frontier.  Not since Hitler invaded the Soviet Union have foreign troops presented such a demonstrable threat to Russia.gtWhat hes not so cleverly avoiding to tell you and hoping you dont know much about the period after the fall of the Soviet Union so he can con you like Chomsky attempts to do is that during that period Russia was given close observer status in NATO and military and nuclear cooperation along with a path into the EU the same offer given to nearly every other former European Soviet Union country. A democratic Russia could have been the largest and highly influential country in the EU with strong military and economic integration. The was even very serious debate and thought about ending NATO because it was no longer relevant. The rest of the former USSR saw the clear benefits to European integration and did the right thing and they and Europe and the world are better for it. And then along came Putin who decided for personal reasons and personal gain he would undue what the US and the EU were trying to build in Europe for peace security and prosperity. Putin alone decided he wanted something else for himself and for his Russia and not because it was in the interest of Russian citizens or under any real threat from the West. Pilger like Chomsky cant seem to recall these vital pieces of history facts and context. They are both mad lying duplicitous cunts for trying to convince their readers of false facts and history. But they sure get the attention they crave.gtShame on you for falling for it.n.b. the caustic tone is how my family shows affection,ifyoulikeblank,damovbr,1,t5_2sekf

9843909,0,t3_5g8ldm,Cowboy Bebop is one of the most well known shows. It features a trio of space bounty hunters. It has some good music in it and it definitely has its comedic moments. This is a good starter anime.Death Note is probably what a lot of new anime fans will say their favorite show is. This show is intense dramatic and at times mindblowing. It features a character with a Godcomplex and interesting view on humanitycrime. I would classify this show as a PsychologicalDramaHorror. Since you gave such a broad request I would probably recommend this first. In my opinion its best if you start of something wellknown and easy for a firsttimer to digest. Fullmetal Alchemist is usually very easy for nonanime watchers to adapt to. The characters are predominantly white and live in an old English setting. Alchemy has become a powerful tool in this world and our two main characters Ed and Al set out to find one of the worlds biggest secrets. I would label this series as ActionFantasyComedyDrama. Ghost in the Shell is one of the best known scifi anime series. It covers topics including cybernetics artificial intelligence cyberterrorism and a slew of other really intriguing futuristic philosophies. Theres also one of the first liveaction American anime adaptions coming out for this giving you just enough time to get caught up. Id say this show is ScifiCyperpunkAction. If this is the show you choose I would recommend you either first watch the  film or begin with Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex and ng Gig. Samurai Champloo is one of your classic samurai anime. If youre looking for a show that explores historic Japan this is a mustwatch. Featuring two intriguing cutthroat swordsman Jin and Mugen they set off with their female companion to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers. This series has awesome music incredible sword fights rich culture and lovable characters. To be completely honest I think some of the other recommendations would be better suited for more seasoned anime watchers. The shows I listed above are very popular highly rated and easy to digest. ,ifyoulikeblank,daqone4,1,t5_2sekf

Radiohead is very emotionally intense especially feelings of dread or anxiety though theres a wide range of sounds and emotions to offer interpretable both on a personal level and simultaneously on a greater sociopolitical scale. Id recommend Exit Music a song I love that was in the show and as far as emotionally intense A Wolf At The Door springs to mind the most. If youre interested the albums OK Computer spacey alt rock about alienation in modern society Kid A very unique experimental electronic rock and In Rainbows beautifully lush pop rock with some electronic are their best work with the first two and Hail to the Thief angry political electronicrock mix pertaining most directly to the dark sociopolitical themes I understand feature in Black Mirror.

10127009,0,t3_5ky4pu,I assume youre talking about Death In June or groups similar to them which are generally considered neofolk. Neofolk is more based in England and industrial music with significant groups such as Current  having members in collectives with Genesis POrridge etc. and has more artists with obscure occult or racist ideologies. The Handsome Family leans more towards gothic country which is a sub genre of alt country.  Gothic country is a more Americana themed genre that doesnt brush against white supremacy much to my knowledge. But you probably want suggestions instead of pedantic information so here are some albums that I personally like from the genre Horsepower  Honestly pretty much anything by them theyre the most notable band in the genre and for good reason. Sackcloth N Ashes and Secret South are good entry points.Jay Munly  Jimmy Carter Syndrome This guy looks like a skeleton and plays the banjo he has a lot of projects that are decent including an adaptation of Peter And The Wolf.The Angels Of Light  How I Loved You Swans mastermind Micheal Giras main side project. Its somewhat weirder than the other stuff here if youve heard Swans you have an idea of what to expect. Woven Hand  Blush Music Woven Hand has some of the members of  Horsepower in it I think. More folk and art focused some really pretty arrangement of folk instruments here.Those Poor Bastards  Satan Is Watching Gritty primal country with entertaining lyrics about the devil and wickedness. The Sad Bastard Book Club  Most of their stuff is pretty cool I think that its only on Bandcamp but good shit.I would also look into Nick Cave and Tom Waits for somewhat similar vibes without the direct Americana bent. I hope this was helpful,ifyoulikeblank,dbrk02u,18,t5_2sekf

The pinpoint accuracy of not only the unorthodox timing of the music but also the dark otherworldly tones and textures that just hit the spot every time that is the trademark of all of his works.

10736638,0,t1_ddmzu22,Okokokok the thing you have to understand about Twin Peaks is that its a parody  homage to cheesy soap operas.  So their weird music stiff acting cliche situations its all intentional.  But its also a sleight of hand to get you distracted so it can hit you in the gut with some very powerful and emotional scenes.  If you are familiar with Lynchs other movies Like Blue Velet or Mullholand Drive then you are probably familiar with how he liked to make movies in the style of classic hollywood detective films.Check out my favorite scene from Twin Peaks for a taste of what to expect.  There arnt any spoilers but you will see a great scene before you understand all the back story.  Suffice to say its a rebellious teen meeting with his uptight military fatherSo once again notice how this clip starts off as very cliche but then shatters your expectations as it goes along.,ifyoulikeblank,ddnej51,5,t5_2sekf

Also it has a very unique camera style cause its from the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. So his movies will kinda sorta have that dreamlike feeling. Birdman The Revenant Children of Men etc. They both got their style from Andrei Tartovsky. So look up his stuff too.

11395076,0,t1_dfn6rwt,Hmm fair enough. I mean I like all the Weezer albums I mentioned I guess I am looking more for what Green has that the other albums dont and its hard to explain the exact reasons since there are songs on each of those albums that kind of fit what I am looking for. Like the main difference that I could have emphasized more is that Green has a lot more straightforward song structures and much more prominent vocal harmonies when compared to their other albums. That is still on some songs on Blue probably No One Else and Holiday come the closest. Blue uses less vocal harmonizing and more complex song structures generally speaking. The original Weezer bassist Matt has a tendency to harmonize by just singing the same melody in falsetto which is not what I am looking for here.  Make Believe has stuff that fits what I want too like maybe Perfect Situation... I  guess I was thinking more of songs on it like This Is Such a Pity Freak Me Out or Beverly Hills which do some nonweezery experimental things rapping synths etc that draw away from the guitarvocals. There is also lot of dynamic range in the songs too which I am not particularly looking for ie quiet verses explosive choruses like in Hold Me. Really with Pinkerton I was just thinking it is a bit more raw emotional and dark sounding ie on Getchoo or Falling for You. Songs like Greens songs like Dont Let Go Knockdown Dragout O Girlfriend pretty much embody what I want. Tons of vocal harmonies loud guitar throughout simple song structure Whew long winded answer sorry. Potty Mouth is cool I think the one thing I would like more from them is more vocal harmonizing but they nail it on some songs. Long Haul from their EP was the song that stood out to me most as what I am looking for. I Really Dont Like You is a good one actually. Could use more of a guitar solo but otherwise just what I am looking for. ,ifyoulikeblank,dfnm71x,2,t5_2sekf
