If your SO is worried about your future one big thing you may point out to her is that you probably have a much better chance of being secure financially in Canada than you would in Japan. Unless you become proficient enough at Japanese for a regular job you would be stuck in English teaching which has a very small chance of career advancement or pay raises.,teachinginjapan,cz8u0is,2,t5_3c154

11260939,0,t1_df5t2ee,So are you on the parttime university EFL teacher circuit or full time in Kanagawa Chiba or Saitama? Another problem one faces if they hold a masters degree  even a doctorate  is that universities are now only offering nonrenewable contracts. Many of those jobs pay well with good conditions but they are temporary. And older teachers will find it hard to get the next contract. Maybe stringing several parttime university jobs together is a better idea since there are no  term limits on parttime positions. But then there is the heavy class load and long commutes between Kanagawa Chiba and Saitama. That could be very draining. ,teachinginjapan,df8esql,2,t5_3c154

11478569,0,t3_63tzsz,I dont have personal experience on this matter but unless its one of Japans top colleges I think you might be overestimating the typical college students English ability and capacity for deep academic discussion.   Also the phonetic alphabet appeared in my JHSs textbook but the students werent actually taught on its use.  I cant speak for HS and college though.                  All that said with a postgrad degree Id say you have decent chances.  You probably want to hear from people whove actually taught English to college students though.  I really dont think linguistics knowledge is that needed for the job but that doesnt mean you cant get it.
