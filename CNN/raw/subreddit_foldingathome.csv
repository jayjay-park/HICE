2940703,0,t1_co1wdtl,The why really comes from the desire to automate some consistency checks on donor side and allow to verifyvisualize all submitted WU and subsequent official results. Like receiving a receipt for a transaction.For example sometimes I see fluctuation of PPD between days which  can depend on the mix of assigned WU the phasing of WU different durations and when they are receivedvalidated delayed update on stats server itself  maybe really lostWhile I believe that there are no lost results or very few I also never really checked on it. Simple because it is difficult as the credit mentioned in the log filePyON messages can be different from the official stats. This makes it a cumbersome exercise to cross check manually. And to tell you a secret Im lazy. But Im willing to work lots to be lazy and make the tools to take over the manual stuff.If we could get a list like mentioned earlier donor team PRCG status credit we could use those file and as an obvious idea use push notifications to distribute confirmed result to the iPad or Android version or download in case of HFM and process those confirmations indicating to users no faulty WU and all booked correctly. No worries. All green.Beside this narrow housekeeping task I also can imagine to collect those data and aggregate Im always curious how many WUs dailyweeklymonthly of what project get done. Across the whole community. And your developer should not waste their time with that though I believe you have that analytics in place. Something rd party can take over as additional contribution to the community.Im sure there will be other ideas coming up once data would be made available.Im not even include additional ideas like adding OS and slot infos e.g. What GPU is used that might be causing privacy concerns and therefore not easy to distribute. But the Donor team and PPD we have already in public stats just to enrich with PRCG and on detail level.Frequency up to limitations you might face hourly every three hours daily all fine.For me just an entry in the crontab to scheduled a curl. But smaller files are easier to handle on all side.,foldingathome,co2dct4,1,t5_2vm4r

5573636,0,t3_3rgzdb,Noticed this on Twitter  Astronaut Scott Kelly recently broke the US record for longest duration space flight. Two of NASAs list of  winning experiment proposals on Dr. Kelly were apparently awarded to Stanford University.  ampnbsp Biomolecular Effects of Space Travel Immunome Changes in SpaceampnbspAn independent article stated there are over  laptops on the ISS. Since FoldingHome research likely dovetails with both of these experiments wouldnt this be an effective bit of publicity for Dr. Kelly to demonstrate to students that related research being conducted on him in space could be conducted insilico right here on earth?  ,foldingathome,cwnylwv,2,t5_2vm4r

7365190,0,t3_4g7m1v,reasonable suggestion. just doesnt get to the heart of the issue. It really doesnt matter how anything is moderated FF or here if there is no structure of accountability. The fundamental issue is that PG labs views donors as a distraction to their research. If they can avoid donor management they will. This stands to reason. They have other priorities other objectives other time constraints. What the project needs is professional management with the sole objective of building and maintaining the donor participation. It may well be that the life cycle of the project is such that this was considered and abandoned  years ago. However this is the only solution that has any chance. The priorities and accountability of management has to be held by the person who has both a vested interest and the ability to affect reform. Researchers have neither the authority or time. Donors have no authority. The FF volunteers have neither authority or access and are blinded by entrenched territory defense. The only hope for meaningful reform is to place administration and communication responsibility in the hands of professional full time management. ,foldingathome,d2fddo7,10,t5_2vm4r
