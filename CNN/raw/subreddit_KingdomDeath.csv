5609702,0,t3_3ryh62,heres a picture of mine.  I screwed up and the feather thats goes in her hair flew across the room forever gone.Biggest tip I can give you is to put both of their heads on absolutely last.The cap sits under the head for both of them and will not go on if their heads are already on.There are three pieces for the fur cape on the girl.  They go together perfectly and form a kind of wave or C shape.  Just fiddle with them before glueing and im sure youll find the right spots.Theres a controversy about where the feather and the long strand go on the girl.   Personally I put the long strand on the hole in her back like its a ribbon.  And the feather was gonna go in her hair i might put one of the tiny masks over the hole instead.  Other people will say that its the other way around but I dont really understand why the feather would go on her back.   Worse case they arent important figures as they are just additional survivors.  You could put them aside and wait for the instructions to pop up on Kingdom Deaths website.,KingdomDeath,cwsfrux,2,t5_2vzhk

5762197,0,t1_cxb6ix2,Well allowed to exploit loops is an interesting formulation. The statement even rises philosophical questions. Allowed with regard to what entity? Its your game you can basically house rule anything and there is no one you have to justify to. So is it rather allowed with respect to some kind of moral perspective? Feeling moral obligations towards a game is ... well interesting but of course ok as well .But Im getting offtopic ... my point was There is no allowed or not allowed. Of course you can use a loop. Or you can decide not to use it. Both is up to you. You also dont need any justification like the game is doing it as well. The only thing you should have in mind is What will provide me with the most fun? and this is a question only you can answer yourself.I like my game brutal and odds stacked all against me.

While I ponder what to do next I am reminded of the struggles and gambles it took to get us to this point. I dont want to take the easy way out an aggressively priced strippeddown version of the experience for the mass market as it undermines the very essence of what the Monster experience has come to be.

9595872,0,t1_d9uzdve,It without a doubt matters and I wholeheartedly agree that the representation of women is oversexualized in KD and gaming. I also notice that all the male figures have the stature of a Greek god. Obviously men dont face the same challenges women do in this respect but I think KD by its very nature has a lot of theming around sex and I suppose Poots was aiming for some fan service in lieu of making that part of the game as disturbing as the rest. Its also abundantly clear hes influenced heavily by animemanga character designs which tend to have the same problems.But whether or not this makes KD intrinsically sexist Im not sure. While the design of the female models and art work could certainly be considered exploitative the actual roles that women play in the game is incredibly feministic. ,KingdomDeath,d9vvy6g,1,t5_2vzhk

The easiest way to tell if something has metal is to look at what items are required to make it ingame. Most weapons and armor are made from monsters bones organs and hide and look like it. Others like some of the phoenix gear require iron and should look a little metallic.

What we have gotten hints of though is that Adam doesnt like sleeving his cards and he has designed with this in mind and that theres unlikely to be enough room to sleeve cards and add many expansions. I have built my own custom insert and there is basically zero wasted room. With that theres barely enough space to fit all of the current expansions and I was even forced not to sleeve some of the cards so that it would all fit.

Honestly the only real downside to it is that it is heavy.If you add to a full set the regeneration suit you can use it to tank anything L and L this game can currently throw at you monster or nemesis with the exception of L Lion God if getting hit straight to the face is your strategy and L DBK because it hits too often if you dont have a bit of evasion stacked.Anyway when you get that guard and its free version you will see it for yourself why it is that good.,KingdomDeath,ddcqccw,1,t5_2vzhk

That book contains set ups for  extra campaigns as well as rules for making your own but it uses content from all  original expansions you seem only interested in Dragon King and Gorm for now.Speaking of which those  are great first choices! Dragon King already comes with an alternate campaign and Gorm is a great early game monster for when you get tired of the Lion.

I know its somewhat clique but i still think there is merit to it.I will however say I dont like the anime esque red witch concept art like the blind folded floating creepy lady is cool but the smiling super cutesy one is almost a deal breaker for me because it just doesnt fit aesthetically qith what the red witches do same goes to a much lesser extent to the dude in the concept art too,KingdomDeath,dedel2y,4,t5_2vzhk

Not just sexual but horror porn survivalist porn and by its price tag luxury board game porn. And thats okay.Not everything needs to be safe for work. Not everything needs to acceptable for all tastes. SUampSD made a fair criticism when they compared it to weird progrock. Not everyone will enjoy it but if you do then thats fine. Own up to the fact. Theres nothing wrong with liking hyper sexualized things. Thats the nature of porn. Is it sexist? Probably. Does that make it wrong? Not as long as recognize what it is and not let it affect your lifestyle.At the end of the day porn doesnt need defending. Everybody has their own versions. KDs version is full of half naked super models male and female dying repeatedly to Danteesque bodyhorrors. I like it and thats enough for me.,KingdomDeath,dedoj60,0,t5_2vzhk
11005172,0,t1_deensoe,Yeah Flower Knight seems to be on a lot of lists. Id love to have Slenderman but now Im thinking maybe Honeycomb Weaver instead of Screaming God. Its just a more disgusting looking character read amazing overall in my opinion. ,KingdomDeath,defelb2,1,t5_2vzhk
11009893,0,t1_def8ww2,haha. These are all good points... both devin and fallout. I will admit that I havent watched too much horror... or body horror... or strayed into any clubs... but I definitely understand the area that youre coming from. It is always interesting to see something standard twisted and spat back out in the viewers face.Never really considered this aspect of the body horror. Perhaps this will shed a new light on some of the miniatures although doesnt change the fact that my little people dont need to see sunstalker sitting on a display shelf. P As I said Im not really against any of it. Some of it came across as slightly unnecessary to me which I suppose means that it did its job effectively!,KingdomDeath,defxvl7,2,t5_2vzhk

11042701,0,t1_dejkbc2,Would you happen to already own the Lion Knight expansion? It lists  Special Terrain Cards and Im not sure what size they are.

11097149,0,t1_depq77t,Thats kind of the case for everything though. You could play the game without using any of the miniatures as long as you had something to represent survivors and monsters on the board. I know people who never used anything but the starting survivors for example. ,KingdomDeath,depuosn,1,t5_2vzhk

11111137,0,t1_dere0ej,Let me be perfectly clear if I wasnt in the original post. I obviously dont have access to hard numbers for KDM therefore anything I suggest could be totally overruled by those facts. At the same time I also dont have access to Adams thought process only he knows where he wants to take this company ultimately. Also to be clear the suggestions I made werent shortterm goals. This was a generic road map for the longterm. As for demand forecasting I think youre selling the idea short. Forecasting tools would have potentially solved the biggest problem anyone has with KDM stock. Regardless of how much someone loves the game and company as a whole I dont think youll find anyone that will say stock availability hasnt been a problem and that concern has gone away with the new kickstarter only time will tell if this problem will be absolved obviously. I in no way think its a silver bullet but instead a single tool in a long list of things that could help the company as a whole.,KingdomDeath,derfrzl,1,t5_2vzhk
11114828,0,t1_dersyks,This seems to be the majoritys response but for various reasons. Namely they just want the game to remain boutique and small. I totally understand the desire but I cant help but feel like its a little selfish too as you stated. Not trying to criticize anyone that feels this way but it seems like dragons hoarding treasure. Know what I mean?,KingdomDeath,deruuem,1,t5_2vzhk

11175802,0,t3_5zdtsm,I know its not a exactly a expansion but I am really looking forward to the gamblers chest with the KD advanced rulebook and the bone eaters during the hunt phase and adding extra nemesis monsters what could give you more in a  box.,KingdomDeath,deyrjcj,3,t5_2vzhk
11177546,0,t3_5zkarf,Any reason youre skipping First Hero? As someone who already owns the core game and  expansions this is the expansion I am most excited for. I figured all of us KD veterans would be prioritizing First Hero for the flexibility in starting campaigns in the middle and end so we dont have to grind Lions and Gorms for hours each time.,KingdomDeath,deyynhf,2,t5_2vzhk
11190586,0,t1_df0davw,I just did that.  cost increase for shipping to have them when the core game arrives was worth it to me. ,KingdomDeath,df0fuac,2,t5_2vzhk
11221247,0,t1_df3nkp1,Fair warnng here the cut and print qualitycolor for promo cards are VASTLY different and inferior to the core game cards. The promos are cut more like playing cards and are more glossy than game cards and stick our of the pile by a few mm when combined with the rest of the hunt deck. Basically. the promo hunt events arent going to be any secret or even random like they were intended to be which is a bummer because I think its a really neat concept. You could write the events on some of the core event cards since there are so many of them but then youre skewing your odds to draw it from like  to . Just something to keep in mind. It made me sad.,KingdomDeath,df3wxb4,1,t5_2vzhk
11223335,0,t3_607j1o,Sepia is solid but I reckon armor would look really sick with a very light dry brush of a light gray color the stark contrast and deep shadow would look sick. Going further I like the sepia because of the earthen tone the dusty dirt look to the stone but I think it lacks shadowdark contrasts. I would try experiment with your Armor tile then add sepia on top avoiding the deeply shadowed areas and add your highlight.,KingdomDeath,df45g9t,1,t5_2vzhk

11246217,0,t1_df6oxs9,Thanks feedback mate.I agree on size the first version was at about  size and it was too small for the stacking to feel right this one is a bit too large. Im currently printing a set for a friend but at  xy scaling too see how that works.As for the shield shape we are almost only using custom sheets and none of them kept the original shape so it just ended up in a random shield shape P,KingdomDeath,df6qpvr,3,t5_2vzhk
11248707,0,t3_60hhrq,Also  things got a lot more expensive than expected when Adam decided to go for hard plastic miniatures. So yes things were a lot cheaper back then. But on the other hand people backing now know a lot more about the game and what to expect. ,KingdomDeath,df70vxu,2,t5_2vzhk

11493756,0,t1_dfyozum,Hmmm interesting. By year  I have most of the innovations I really need and by late game I sometime dont bother innovating at all much less innovate twice.Also red fist is amazing and a second shot or first if you are people of the sun at it is amazing.And Bone Witch is the worst.Cannibalism is very strong early game where you need resources more than innovations as well as when the majority of your deaths take place.,KingdomDeath,dfyteau,-2,t5_2vzhk
11503842,0,t1_dfzpkoo,there isnt a reason for them to be sturdy its a board game. It doesnt take longer and even so were talking about such a little amount of time that it becomes arbitrary. How they look is opinion and irrelevant. ,KingdomDeath,dfzylm1,1,t5_2vzhk

11667349,0,t1_dgigl93,I would be happy to post my in progress changes to this page once I get my stuff to solicit feedback or just share it to those interested. Im thinking maybe like question flowcharts on the settlement events where some have dice rolls and others are static changes so one always has a choice between bad and worse. Spiderlings are swarming the settlement how do you deal with them? Roll them the legless ball. Event over. Or try to fight them off with maybe one just keeping the ball and the second trying to score some extra silk at high risk. Well to be continued in a few months eh? Heres hoping for .!,KingdomDeath,dgiickw,1,t5_2vzhk

11682237,0,t3_66oml5,I dont think that it will drop that much and even if it does it truly doesnt matter. The aesthetic and price of the game bring in a lot of haters but there is no denying that KDM has already claimed its place in the history of boards games. Right now in what many people claim to be the golden age of tabletop gaming we are seeing plenty of new game mechanics and designs. But none of the other games have done what Kingdom Death has done. Even if at times the mechanics of the game can feel unbalanced and too much like rng based simulation... the game has taken what makes board games unique from video games and craked it up to . The components are insanely high quality and may be expensive but that is because they can be. The game may require an unreasonable number of play sessions and hours to actually finish a campaign yet it embraces this. The game is less forgiving than Dark Souls and can make you question if youre actually having fun while watching your hours of character development get ripped away from you... But unlike a video game where you might rage quit and smash a keyboard the fact that KDM is a tabletop game allows you to take the horror and build real relationships with the people around you. People are realizing that tabletop games allow for a much more human form of interaction that video games still cannot achieve and KDMs success is the result of this. Even if the rating drops over time as people begin to pick apart mechanics and find issues with the game there is no denying that the game has already become legendary.,KingdomDeath,dgk75fm,11,t5_2vzhk
