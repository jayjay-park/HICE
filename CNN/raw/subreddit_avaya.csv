I never found an auto attendant button in the manager program but I followed the incoming all route and it was sending all of company Bs number to  and company A to .  I had no idea what those numbers were.  I just found the Voicemail Pro Client and there I see shortcodes for both  and .  Im assuming this is the type of install that has the auto attendant on the voicemail module.I feel like Im in the right place but still not sure how to make this one extension available in the  voicemail group.  ,avaya,d1wdw3j,1,t5_2smko
7639602,0,t1_d3akdwj,I understand. The solution Im describing would look something like this USB adapter y connector and headset Those are all specific to Plantronics but there are other manufacturers. This is a common way that larger Avaya call centers solve this problem. At least in terms of allowing somebody to sit right next to another employee and listen in. If you want the listener to be somewhere completely different then there are software solutions to consider. Thats why I asked the platform question. On the larger Avaya Communication Manager platform there is something called Service Observe where one phone can monitor another. It sounds like you are on the smaller IP Office platform. I am less familiar with IP Office but I think they have a similar feature called Call Listen.,avaya,d3akwl5,3,t5_2smko
