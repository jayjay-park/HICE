2173381,0,t3_24vkm8,Hey  I know this post is  months old but I just finished up opening a beer store in Michigan so I can definitely help out a bit.Licensing is MI is split between on and offpremise with liquor being a separate entity for offpremise.  To open a bottle shop you need an SDM license.  This lets you sell beer and wine to go.  Liquor requires an SDD license.  There is no quota or cap for SDMs meaning that as long as you meet criteria not too close to a school etc. you should be able to get one.  SDDs are capped by citytown so you would have to see if one is currently available in your area.  The MLCC website has tons of info on this.The issue with growler fills is that it requires an onpremise license.  These are much harder to come by and are generally costly.  Sorry if this is too vague.  Let me know if you have any questions  it took a while to navigate all the legalities so Id be more than willing to help.,TheBrewery,clg37ms,1,t5_2so8u

2951581,0,t3_2tz097,This is a tough one. Unfortunately in food service front of the house will always make more than back of the house because of tips. Is it fair? No.You have to look at your bartenders a different way though. They dont just pour beer. They are the face of the brewery to the public. They are kind of similar to actors in movies. The movie crew doesnt make comparatively as much money as the actors either. If your bartenders truly make that much money feel free to increase their requirements. Make them take classes to better learn about your product pay them hourly for these. Gradually increase the standard of which you hold them to. Stuff like that. They will do it if they make  a shift. If not someone will give their left nut to take the position paying that well.There is one caveat though. It is borderline unethical to make your front of the house staff do too much labor not directly related to serving customers because in many cases they dont make any wages from the establishment.As for the brewers deserving more money there are ways to direct the flow of money in their direction. Bars have a position called a barback. They wash dishes stock things that run low clean up messes etc. The bartenders usually tip the barbacks  of their tips. Maybe see if any of your brew guys want extra money and rotate them in that job. That will bring them between  extra cash on top of their wages.,TheBrewery,co3lx12,6,t5_2so8u

PAA is the top contender but it carries the same risks as the other solutions mentioned and rejected.. The question for bottling on a small scale is this  would you rather risk oxidation or contamination?  You are going to have to compromise on one and I think every brewer out there would risk oxidation over contamination.  Theres no way you can sanitize the bottles and get  oxygen free conditions while also sanitizing them without a bottling line. You are going to have to convince the owners of this eventuality.Oxidation is going to mean a small reduction in quality after some time on the shelves.

The things that are going to vary with a function of brewhouse size is going to be labour utilities rent need larger space for larger brewery etc. So the variables between these two scenarios is VERY much dependent on all costs involved. Your marginal cost will go down per batch you produce but again this is relative to your fixed costs.

6530276,0,t1_czuqrb6,Kinda depends on your pack out. If you have to pack out manually no pak tek machine  people is average but it is doable with . The purgefill has a semiautomatic option or whats called the operator modetest mode. Once you have it dialed in for the can run the fill heads run automatically. Its not like youre sitting there punching a button every time  cans line up with the purgefill station. There are two sensors that detect the correct can alignment and trigger the fill heads to lower and dispense. If theres not a can present the heads will not dispense. We personally dont use a depaletiser nor do any of the mobile canning companies in the area Ive worked with. We use a pallet jack and whale tale it works for our needs but again this would be a larger issue if we were canning from brites bigger than bbl or if we were canning for more than  hours everyday. This is an option we are starting to consider as we are adding more brites and upping our output but definitely not something I would consider a critical add on early in the game.  ,TheBrewery,czus60l,1,t5_2so8u

6680118,0,t3_474wn6,Always a bummer to hear that QA is too expensive to invest in but I get that bbls of fermentation capacity may not have the extra cash flow to allow for it. I think youre absolutely right that the farther the beer goes once it leaves your hands the more diligent you need to be about flavor stability.Counting cells can help with consistency in fermentation timeline and fermentation flavor contributions and doing a viability stain can help dial in yeast handling and pitching practices to further improve fermentation flavor consistency.But if youre seeing a difference between aged bottlescans and the same batch on draft the difference is almost definitely coming from the packaging equipment or the transfer process if theyre put into different bright tanks or a difference in how the bottlescans are handledstored vs how the kegs are.Without even getting into investment in lab equipment sensory evaluation can be extremely valuable. If you were to do blind triangular tastings of the same batch from cansbottles and draft after a certain amount of time and could pick out the difference and characterize what the difference is that could help focus your QA approach.Im not sure what level of price and commitment becomes overwhelming for you but have a look at Siebels Essential QC course. I attended it and found it highly valuable. Though of course applying what you learn will take buyin from the brewery you work for.

Verizon wont open the secure ports in the firewall unless I pay them  for a static IP address. Mood couldnt give a shit if I get this figured out. For  bucks I could fold to the BMI types or I could just sit in silence.We all know what its like to get hassled for free products. I do honestly understand that this stuff is licensed and that performers deserve to get paid. But it couldnt be less consumer friendly. Its a fuck you pay me scenario. Weve all got better things to pay for. Theres always something that could be upgraded or improved so cutting into budget just to have background noise grinds my gears.Plus dont threaten me into paying you.

9560426,0,t3_5btbnb,This might not be directly relevant. I used to work at a Peter austin brewery that had just added conical fermenters. At the time they were still using Ringwood and they pretty much crashed all their ringwood beers early  like a few points early. The yeast we got from the bottom vs top cropping was still used indefinitely. Fermentation performance was not effected. The only difference we noticed was more dead cells so we pitched a little more when using bottom cropped yeast.When they eventually stopped crashing the beers early the bottom cropped yeast did take a serious hit in performance. It was after I left but I believe that was one of the reasons they finally stopped using Ringwood. What this suggests to me is that the harvested yeast is actually healthier if you crash early. Ringwood is a weird yeast though. ,TheBrewery,d9rioq0,2,t5_2so8u

On top of that the scope of the work you are expected to do is a lot narrower and blame can but put on the equipment more easily when there is a problem. Brewing is high stress with long hours.Brewing is making sugar water. Cellarwork is making beer but its dirty wet and cold. Packaging is making something that is actually the end result for your consumers.If you really care about your beer you know that packaging is the most critical step requiring everything to be working perfectly with little room for error. Problems can be fixed upstream and have a longer lead time to fix. If you eff up your package your beer is done. I heard a talk once where the speaker called bottles thousands of individual tiny fermenters.

11249287,0,t3_60jaom,Hobby loss rules would apply after a few years. The IRS would go back and disallow any write off against ordinary income. Without a license to sell you would have no income from the business to write off as well. If you claimed the loss in the first year as start up expenses a couple years later when there was still no income from the business the IRS would go back and make you pay taxes on it...plus penalties for failure to pay taxes timely.,TheBrewery,df7399w,9,t5_2so8u

We can move a huge volume very quickly we dont waste time washingrinsing at the time of sale and we counterpressure fill to improve quality.  We do deposits on growlers so you can return to the brewery and arent stuck with it. Also you obviously cant fill any growlers but your own.,TheBrewery,dfafa5q,1,t5_2so8u

11403822,0,t3_62p2zh,Short of it is instead of using a heat exchanger you pump the justboiled wort into this big shallow rectangular vessel where it cools overnight and is inoculated by spontaneous ambient microbes. The next day you pump into barrels or foeders stainless whatever you want and let it rip for  years. Belgian lambic and geueze use this method as well.

11479065,0,t1_dfwzghm,What mash efficiency are you calculating at? Depending on your mash tun geometry you may find that the efficiency decreases exponentially the more grain you add in. For example I found that putting lbs of malt in my tun smushed the bed to the point that my yield dropped to the same level as beers we were making at lbs. We were effectively wasting lbs of malt trying to make bigger beers.,TheBrewery,dfx5ct4,1,t5_2so8u
11522277,0,t3_64g773,It runs fantastic for us around  cans per minuteWGC... My biggest issue with the line is that the wiring is ran horizontally across behind amp below the fillers... So when you spray it down with a hose amp wipe it down... The hard water build up in between is a pain in the rear to clean constantly. I wish they wouldve ran the wires overhead amp dropped them straight down to where they need to be. Also the lid dropper is super sensitive. If youre going to adjust anything just do so little by little. My thoughts behind the line are to find one person who learns a ton about the line amp who is actually interested in packaging every time. They will care for the equipment so much better than someone who knows theyll move into a bettercanning beer is bomb! position amp knows it wont be their problem anymore.,TheBrewery,dg21voj,1,t5_2so8u
