The kit will look much smoother that way.Also if possible buy matte varnish for the skin to give your kit varying textures  Overall though its definitely not half bad!,resinkits,d1ny3um,2,t5_2zwa6
8919127,0,t1_d7jtgc9,Exactly! It was a small eventcommunity and some of the staff looked at me like I was weird. They were basically a bunch of friends showing off their kits to each other but the competition was open for everyone. The event was at a room during an anime convention and I was sure to spend almost all my time there but I spent maybe  of my time in that room during the whole convention  days. The atmosphere wasnt great and I felt like I wasnt part of the group. Some guys there were very nice but Im not even sure if I want to participate in the next competition. I had to talk to the boss of the event because I wasnt sure if I could participate because I had metal parts and two rubber pipes from Kotobukiya on my kit. They were kind enough to let me in the competition but one more piece of foreign plastic and I couldnt participate it kinda ruins the mood when youve been working on a kit for  months.Gunpla is freedom but so is modeling in general. Gunpla competitions are really cool but modeling is more than Gundams. To be honest with you Im more interested in Five Star Stories kits and resin kits including conversion kits for now. I would really like to build a resin Gundam but a lot of people only swear by plastic in the community. Some of them become REALLY aggressive when you mention the word resin. Anyway I could go on and on about this but Ill stop If you want to talk more Gunpla or modeling in general Id love to though.,resinkits,d7jy5s6,1,t5_2zwa6
