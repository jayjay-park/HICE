7847826,0,t1_d3xsifk,Tony Espie mixed this album as well as Since I Left You. Not a huge deal but a nice touch nonetheless. ,theavalanches,d3y5ybj,2,t5_2sfpx
7852575,0,t3_4mvmd5,Im still holding out hope that theres going to be a full Since They Left Us doco that will cover this. Its hard to know who did what in The Avalanches but I always got the impression that Robbie and Darren were the driving creative forces.In the Beats interview Zane Lowe did ask Robbie about this but it was kind of a softball question that suggested that Robbie had always been the bands brains. Robbie gave an answer that was kind of enigmatic were all Avalanches while also implying that Darrens main role was to be the charismatic front man. But I dont know  the two of them shared an awful lot of production credits including the entire SILY album.I went back and rewatched the old TV documentary and Darren is front and centre of the whole thing especially in a clip where hes choosing samples that would become Summer Crane which makes it look like hes doing most of it himself. But hes also pretty deferential to Robbie in the scenes where the two of them are working together and Robbie seems really awkward on camera. I guess its possible that Darren was doing a simplified recreationreenactment of their sampling process for the camera like how documentaries on Hollywood special effects make it look like an animator can just press a couple of buttons to make a TRex run. The first time I watched it I certainly got the impression that he was the main guy in The Avalanches though.I think his departure means we probably wont see anyone break a leg during this years concerts. For better or worse!Considering that Wildflower is coming out two years after it was announced that Darren left the band its not hard to wonder if he was a reason that why the second album was taking so long. We might have more of an idea based on what Wildflower sounds like and if hes credited on any of the tracks or mentioned in the liner notes.,theavalanches,d3yp716,25,t5_2sfpx

7898386,0,t1_d43ukfy,Was thinking the same thing. SILY is a bit more beat oriented even though a great chunk wasnt than how Wildflower sounds. I already kind of forgot most of the previews but Sunshine just sounded like the original sample altered a bit. Not really a beat.,theavalanches,d43up1b,3,t5_2sfpx

7940176,0,t1_d48jhju,I like it a lot but I understand people expecting something different. I like that hes trying to come at hiphop from a different angle. Hes really serious about bending the Bay Area sound the beats and percussion especially to his own perspective while still including lots of different ideas.I think he knows what hes doing and this shows lots of growth and improvement but everyone is entitled to their opinion. There may be people here who hate the new Avalanches album after they hear it. And Shadow is always a hotbed of contention people wishing he had never changed his style and people being glad he did.In the end I think what is important to say about this record is it isnt The Outsider which really was confusing and all over the place. This is more focused and feels cohesive. I really enjoyed it but I want to hear what everyone else thinks.,theavalanches,d48jt9z,1,t5_2sfpx

8081745,0,t3_4pwms4,Hey guys I went nuts over the stream and listened to it for a while but I really would advise against listening to the full album like this. Its transcoded  kbps mono for the radio so literally these files are  kbps which is beyond awful. I was curious like Im sure all you are and of course I think its alright to listen to stuff here and there to check out the vibe of each track. But your first real full playthrough of Wildflower? Not like this. According to chan the entire thing will be available to stream come Friday on NPR or a similar streaming service. Seriously at this point you all should just wait for that if youre in the mood to actually listen to the whole album. Youve come too far. Im not even saying to not listen to leaks just dont listen to all of Wildflower in below potato quality. You owe yourself better,theavalanches,d4ogobt,10,t5_2sfpx
