403283,0,t3_1ypcmy,The point of Godwins Law the Nazis did a lot of stuff we dont like some of which Republicans may do and other stuff you or I might do its trivial to identify traits people and organizations have in common with Nazis. The distinct evil of the Nazis wasnt tribal mythology militarism press censorship vilification of certain groups propaganda voter fraud or submission to a charismatic leader ampmdash it was  their movement climaxing in a systemic genocide of millions something no one expected a modern industrial nation could stoop to.We can be reasonably confident the GOP would not perform such an act at least not on american soil. To equate Republicans with a genocidal movement is manipulative and generally unnecessary at least in political discourse. Unsympathetic readers will see only an unreasonable insult from a partisan overly eager to cheat in logical arguments and correctly so.For a list of other traits the Republican far right has in common with what Ill loosely call fascist pigs everywhere do a few Google searches on rightwing authoritarianism and authoritarian personality Hours of fun. Even that doesnt well describe the social foundations of americas rightwing but if youre interested in what rightwing organizations have in common it connects some of the dots.,uspolitics,cfmkeod,2,t5_2qwlq

10011524,0,t1_dbcih2f,I dont want to paint the picture that I think ALL conservatives are hateful ect. I am merely pointing out that both sides draw these sorts of lines in the sand. The tone of the article seems to imply that this is a widespread phenomenon and that only liberals do it. That is what I take issue with. Just as all conservatives arent some giant monolithic stereotype of hatefilled guntoting Mericans not all liberals are totalitarian SJWs who have been indoctrinated into the leftist agenda dead set on destroying traditional families or religion.My issue is not with ALL conservatives. My issue is with the article and the sort of caricature it paints of liberal folks. I take issue with caricatures of conservative folks as well. I just wanted folks who maybe read this article and nodded their heads to step  back a moment and consider that there may be real human reasons why someone would want to cut off ties with a Trumpsupporting relative even if that reason is just that they felt attacked and are nervous about the charged rhetoric our presidentElect has used and the people he is surrounding himself with.

The PEOTUS is using his twitter to slash the stock value of companies he doesnt like if not to enrich himself then because he refuses to let the free market be. I dont see why a businessman would do the former so its most likely the latter. Unless he really is acting like the CEO of America in which case you can say goodbye to the free market entirely.
