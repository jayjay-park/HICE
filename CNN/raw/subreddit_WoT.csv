224984,0,t3_1wow65,Ive posted this before but theres something you need to keep in mind about Faile that makes her far less annoying. We only see her from Perrins perspective and thanks to Perrins super wolf nose the man is a full blown empath. That means that people tend to judge Faile based on every single flicker of emotion that she has.Heres an archtypical conversation between Perrin and Faile from two different PoVs.Perrin gt Berelain walks by and jiggles at Perrin. Faile doesnt react but smells jealous. Perring reassures her that she doesnt need to be jealous. Faile tells him perfectly calmly that she knows that but now she smells jealous hurt and angry. Perrin broods.Failegt Berelain walks by and jiggles at Perrin. She ignores the hussy chasing after her husband  she knows Perrin is completely loyal to her  and makes sure that nothing shows on her face. Suddenly Perrin tells her she doesnt need to be jealous. She tells Perrin that she knows that but why would he mention that out of the blue like that? She knew that none of her feelings towards Berelain were on her face. Did Perrin think that Faile needed the reassurance because there was something to be worried about? sigh No Perrin didnt mean that of course. Hes trying his best so theres no reason to let him know how upset I am right now. Oh great whats he brooding about now?A lot of Failes PoV scenes in the books bear this out she knows that Perrin is devoted to her and isnt actually worried about him cheating.,WoT,cf42dxb,99,t5_2rdg1

347724,0,t1_cfgnl8k,They attract and destroy. The best explanation of it comes when RJ answered what happened at the cleansing. INTERVIEW Apr th Leiden Signing Report  Aanallein VerbatimISABELgtCan you give some more details on how the taint was cleansed? I was sort of confused reading the book.ROBERT JORDANgtYou dont think its obvious? Err lets see. You have... Youre using both repulsion and attraction of opposites here. Repulsion of things that are opposite and attraction of things that are the same. The Taint upon saidin as versus the conduit which is made of saidar through which the saidin passes. The saidin and saidar as men and women are in many ways opposite. It repels one another. It is safe to make this conduit of saidar between saidin and Shadar Logoth because there can be no mixing. As the eh... as saidin passes through as the taint passes through the saidar actually repels it pushes it away from saidin... alright?gtNow you have a taint on... the eh Source the male half of the Source you have the taint on Shadar Logoth. Theyre not the same yet they are. The taint on Shadar Logoth did not come from the Dark One. The taint was created by humans who believed that they must do whatever was necessary anything that was necessary to defeat the Shadow. And because they would accept no limits to what they would do to what could be done to what needed to be done they created their own destruction. Their evil is or was as great as that of the Dark One but diametrically opposite. It is an evil created for the best of intentions created for good intentions. So it is the opposite. So this attraction created the conduit begins to pull the taint from saidin to siphon it off. Remember its always been described its not as mixed all through saidin it is like a thin skin of rancidness think of a thin skin of rancid oil floating on a pond and if you get through it youve got clean water but you cant get through it without putting your hand in that oil. Youre getting it on your hand...gtTo attract one another because they are opposites but because even being opposite they have gone far enough around the circle they act to destroy one another. You see its not opposites along a straight line. Were actually talking opposites along a circle. Continuing the motif of the Wheel of Time if you will. So youve got two things that are both opposites and the same. Hes been waving his hands in the air for this. Hands far apart for the straight line versus hands together making a circle and coming together again That will both attract one another and negate one another.gtDo you understand better now?ISABELgtYes thank you.ROBERT JORDANgtOh and one last point Its all imaginary my dear...,WoT,cfgt5t7,5,t5_2rdg1
355663,0,t1_cfhgy7z,Still looking for it but I found this from a Brandon signing reportgt One fan asked Brandon to rank Mats combat ability compared to other characters in the series.  Brandon described Mat as good and above the curve.  However compared to Lan mat was completely outclassed.  Brandon confirmed that Lan is at the top in terms of combat ability but added that at his height Tam was pretty darn good and could have taken Mat.  However Brandon cautioned that all this was not factoring Mats luck.  Mats combat abilities vary a great deal depending on whether he was ticked off what the stakes of the battle were and whether he was in awesome Mat mode.,WoT,cfhmq7m,4,t5_2rdg1

The mistborn series the way of kings etc.  Theyll help a lot when reading his WoT books.  To me there was kind of a shock between his and RJs writing for WoT.  But reading his previous works helps you realize that hes changed some of his style just for WoT and that he gets better at it very quickly after his first few chapters.  All his previous work is really good too.  Look for deep foreshadowing.  Theres a ton of it that I never even realized till my rd readthrough.  And I imagine Ill keep finding more.

Also consider the practical considerations Lews Therin is  years old the oldest a non channeller would live at that point is I believe around  since they dont slow... this means Lews Therin would be centuries older than his wife and could only have married her at best  years before the breaking... that would strain the timelines quite a bit the world was falling apart for a century after Lanfear opened the bore so she would have had to fall in love with Lews Therin and then lose him to a woman maybe th his age all within that hundred years...but there is another problem Lews Therin was never said to have only killed his children but everyone who bore even a drop of his blood... that implies grandchildren maybe even more generations past that something a nonchanneller Ilyena would seriously call into question... the specificity on that point that he killed all of his kin not just children would lead me to conclude she was able to slow and thus channel.,WoT,cfqe0tm,1,t5_2rdg1

COT was the first time I really resented the writer for dragging things out. But I had to wait another year for KOD. You know Im not convinced Jordan was just padding out the series. I think he was a perfectionist and the large story he wanted to tell got out of control. Too many plot threads that he wanted to include all heading towards the last battle. Should he compromise on his lifes magnum opus?Its the same reason Sanderson decided to make the last book into three. Its not a cash grab once youve read them. So many if Mins viewings so many character arcs coming to fruition it was as long as it needed to be and people often say BS sped up the pacing.Maybe it will help you to stop thinking of the later novels as stand alone stories. Earlier books had plots with months between them large events at the end that felt like conclusions of the start of the books.

745432,0,t1_cgox3rs,Nyneaves arc is wonderful. Shes a village elder way ahead of her time which means that she feels she cant take criticism at all because it weakens her. Thats her big flaw why she resents Moiraine and Aes Sedai in general early on. She gets chances to grow on her own and does and becomes Rands greatest ally. Her testing and raising to Aes Sedai demonstrates this. She is a woman of the world by the end capable of the tough decisions and aware of both her limits and her strengths. Egwene takes a much longer path to the same truths. She attaches herself the the core conceit of The Tower knows all and fights to make that true for  books. She is purposely raised to Amyrlin by a Hall that contains at least  Black Ajah. They planned to make her a figurehead. Her eventual growth is impressive considering the obstacles placed in her path. However in the first  books she is the brainy little sister who is insufferable not because she knows it all like Hermione in HP but because she thinks she does and we as the reader know the limits of her knowledge. It isnt until she is able to use the knowledge she gained among the Aiel to turn suffering to her advantage and she proves that she learned politics that she becomes worthy of Verins gift. Elayne is easily the worst written of the three. Shes a spoiled brat who doesnt know shes a spoiled brat. She should have returned to Andor in book  and then her civil war plot wouldnt have annoyed me as much. Having her with the Kin didnt add much to the story and in general she makes more mistakes in leadership than the other two and she was supposed to be born to it. The interaction with Perrin could have gone better and should have as she essentially risked a second civil war on the brink of Tarmon Gaidon because of her bruised pride. Insufferable. The only reason her sections were readable was Birgitte. She felt more real than Elayne and thats odd. ,WoT,cgp0g0r,2,t5_2rdg1

1278455,0,t1_cid8pa0,I dont think he really buys the whole Channeling is evil thing like most white cloaks. Instead I think his attraction to the Children was because he viewed the Tower itself as an organization that abuses the power they hold due to channeling and education as demonstrated in their use of Elayne as a pawn in their schemes. And no matter what you think of the scheme how important it is whether Elayne did so willingly she was being used. Galad finds that to be wrong and so joins a group that is opposed to the white tower. He never talks about channeling being evil that I can recall. Maybe he says its a temptationits hard to remember. But hes the only white cloak who can look past what channelers do and see that theyre not all bad and part of the reason is the close ties he has to those who can channel. I think he views the Children as a group who fights for whats right and probably becomes disillusioned by it pretty quickly. Also I think one of the things he lacked while training at the tower was some form of guidance or purpose perhaps. Here he is an expert of battle tactics having learned from Gareth Bryne an expert swordsman on the level of a swordmaster and yet hes just a trainee. The things that seemed to anchor him there were his sister and Egwene and when they left he needed more I think. He probably thought that the white cloaks would give him direction give him purpose. ,WoT,cidfz77,2,t5_2rdg1

Remove as many Forsaken from the game as he could.

Cairhein went first because it was being actively threatened with destruction by the Shaido. Andor jumped in line above Illian after the rumors Rahvin killed Morgase. After taking out the known Forsaken he would try to restore order to the lands in chaos Arad Doman etc. Then the Borderlands who would follow anybody to fight Trollocs especially when his friend raised the Golden Crane.

Again though I think you have entirely missed my point. He is way more crazy in The Shadow Rising than you realize. He is way way more crazy in The Fires of Heaven than you realize. And so on and so forth. Its there to see if you look closely. Its just hard to notice since we tend to empathize with Rand so much. Now I think there is some truth to the statement that ucornballin makes in that Rands exhaustion exacerbated some of the madness we see in The Dragon Reborn. However even before his crazy headless kneeling romp he exhibits bad signs. Back in the valley for instance during the Trolloc attack or in the first village they go to before the exhaustion should have started enacting such a heavy toll. Those instances line up pretty well with his behavior in The Shadow Rising. In fact in that book it starts getting worse.  Also I never said he was exactly as insane in The Dragon Reborn as in Towers of Midnight or really The Gathering Storm since by Midnight he had sealed it off. It is much much much worse in The Gathering Storm compared to anything we see in Dragon. ,WoT,cmi97gd,0,t5_2rdg1

3073938,0,t3_2vd25d,I agree with your general sentiment but purely from a producers point of view mind it is not even close to being on par with GoT or LotR in terms of surety on investment. Much riskier much more expensive much more material much less likely to convert to a hit.LotR was only three novels easily adapted to three feature length films. It also took the better part of a century to finally come to the silver screen amp and was a certified classic when it did. Prosthetics were heavily used but cgi was kept to a minimum.GoT is a genrebender slated to finish up in  novels seasons. It requires very little in the way of effects or make up in that is primarily a medieval political thriller in form. Not much in the way of costly prosthetics green screen cgi at least until it was a a runaway hit and had the budget guarantees to pull it off. Its also ridiculously more graphic in both violence sex and overall shock factor to draw in the lowest common denominator in comparison to either LotR or WoT.With the WoT series theres an order of magnitude more printed pages than either LotR or GoT. There is much more evident amp frequent magic that needs to be conveyed convincingly. There are all manner of different beasts and mythical creatures that will require heavy makeup andor CGI. The world is just so much larger the cast is so much larger the expense to produce even a semirespectable adaptation would be phenomenal.As much as I would love to see an adaptation of WoT to the screen the only way i see it as viable is in animated form.,WoT,cogm129,23,t5_2rdg1

You see you really get into the other characters and the POVs broaden the story for the reader in the later books when attention is shifted to Rand its done through others eyes.

We also dont have to wait for any books to be published which is half the issue most people had.  It will feel slow at times because we have a natural desire to know the next plot point but remember when most of us get to the end we wish we had more books to read. Thats still how I still feel. So remember to slow down and enjoy the ride. There are still multiple high points coming.  Here is a pretty sweet video of the drawing of the newer LoC cover with a reading of the battle. gt how exactly did Taim find Rand?I always figured that Taim showed up in Cairhien and Rand was gone remember he is gone awhile at this point along with a bunch of Aiel and the White Tower crew he knew something was wrong and its most likely the Aes Sedai.

3651683,0,t3_3270z4,Leigh Butler noted an interesting phenomenon during her re read over at Tor for those who were reading the series as it was being published their last favorite book is often the first one they really had to wait for. I started reading it just a few months before A Crown of Swords came out so the first book I really had a serious wait for was Path of Daggers ... which happens to be my last favorite.Theres really not much I like about it at all. Rand is just angry and being an ass. The Supergirls are floundering through the snow and being catty. Egwene is bogged down in the most boring of Aes Sedai politics Perrins story is just getting started and theres no Mat at all.CoT on the other hand has two things going for it.  you have some truly great MatTuon interactions. And   and Im being serious here  you have the Faile kidnapped plotline.Right from the beginning we have Mat and Perrin pigeonholed as the wastrel and the responsible one respectively. But consider them as we see them in the story not how they might have been as kids. Ever since we first get in Mats had in book  he has never once failed to live up to his responsibilities. Hell bitch and moan hell swear that hes ready to ride away hell lie to himself about what hes doing and why hes doing it while hes doing it.  A neat trick. But in terms of his actual actions the man is as responsible as they come.And then theres steady reliable Perrin. The guy Moiraine felt no need to watch in the Stone because he knew his duty. Perrin actually spent the vast majority of the series doing everything he could to evade his responsibilities. He didnt want to lead the Two Rivers he figured he would just go sacrifice himself. He eventually lets himself be named LotR and does everything he can to avoid the duties that fund with it. He never knows his purpose because all he has is Faile. Perrin needed the lecture that Bryne gave to Gawyn you need to be your own man and figure out what you want you own life to be and then figure out how the woman you love fits into it.Perrin was willing to throw everything away to save Faile. He said the world could burn if she was safe and he was speaking literally. The only time he really paid attention to the forces following him when he really acted as their leader was when he needed them to get her back. They were a tool. He was even willing to torture a man in child blood on the chance he might know something about Faile.I urge you to take another look at that particular chapter with Perrins overall arc in mind. The moment when he throws away his ax is the moment he realizes just how empty his life is without Faile. Its the reason we dont get rid of Angsty Perrin even after she is rescued.

Perrin did see a man in Telaranrhiod who had lost himself to his wolf side and had been caged in the waking world because of it. The wolfbrother tried to sleep so his soul could be free within Telaranrhiod but his physical misery and the torments of his gaolers kept disrupting his presence from Perrins perspective. So my answer would be Yes Perrin was in danger of losing himself. Would it have happened? Not permanently because he is a main character. But the risk had to be there and he had to find his own balance.,WoT,cq8oeya,4,t5_2rdg1

3705339,0,t1_cqejz1n,Sort of.  Harriets case will probably be that they dont actually have the opportunities they claim and therefore they arent damaged.  Red Eagle will argue that her claim that what they did was unauthorized and didnt allow them to keep the rights hurt them.  Think about it this way who would buy the rights right now knowing that Harriet is claiming that Red Eagle doesnt own them?  Thats what Red Eagle will claim. They will say We own the rights they are the next GOT and because of Harriets statements no one will buy them.   Thats tough to prove but not impossible.  I dont think the pilot really hurts them. There is lots of precedent of works thrown together to keep rights alive fantastic four hobbit etc. and its almost expected at this point.   The bigger issue is whether they can prove that they had opportunities and then lost them because of what Harriet said or did.    They claim they were on the cusp of a TV deal.  I dont think anyone outside of the inner circle knows whether that is true or not.  If its true and if the TV distributor didnt buy because of Harriets actions then Harriet might have a problem.,WoT,cqemtfn,3,t5_2rdg1

I thought he said that they were decent but not beatGaladandGawyn good that is who he beats right?. It is like he came out a blade master which I guess I just missed it on the first read through.The dagger to me was annoying because it completely changed him to the point where he was a new character completely. I know that the dagger would have this effect on him but for some reason it is like a bad M Night Shamalyan movie twist and again I understand that it is justified by the daggers hold but it was a janky transition to me.

3874302,0,t3_34scju,Movements arent necessary for channeling but I think they work as a concentration technique.For example I think RJ mentioned aes sedai making a throwing motion when hurling balls of fire. The motion isnt necessary but the physical act of throwing your arm in the direction of the target makes aim a more subconscious act leaving more focus available to pay attention to ones surroundings.Moiraine mentions using her staff as an aid to concentration in EOTW and she waves it around points it at her target slams it into the ground etc.So in a calm situation or for complex weaves without a specific target like traveling I dont imagine any gesturing or movements.

4387988,0,t3_3b9k31,Thats something that you have to realize about the main continent of this saga They are not the baseline for the world.Over in Seanchan they hunt down any woman who is born with channeling and immediately enslave her. With no regard for personal growth or mental development they probe these women for which elements they handle best and use that information to shape them into something useful. They make them into weapons performers guards servants and forgers.The secrets of making the adam were passed down from the original woman who brought the creation forward who was enslaved by her own device. That information has not been forgotten and has been used to continually forge new adam. Remember that Egwene was seen as a prospective forger of new adam because of her talent for finding minerals. There are skills within the one power that overlap and when youre good at one thing you can be taught something similar.Additionally there was only one real barrier. The adam were not made of Cuendillar. They were made of the same whitish material that mostall terangreal were made of.The prospect of having the talent for forging in so many seems impossible to the Aes Sedai because they have lost the knowledge of how to teach the art but as Egwenes pupils demonstrated with Cuendillar those with a talent for something arent the only ones who can do it they just do it the best. Other women could be taught so long as you knew how to teach them.,WoT,csk9h3q,3,t5_2rdg1
4391189,0,t1_cskio7g,Agreed no ajah existed in the AoL and I assume thats how it returned else the Greens would be relegated to mop duty heh.But as for what RA did currently inuniverse I think the BAinfiltration and the POV characters primarily being antiRed made the Reds seem more odious than they actually were. Their mission statement was more immediate warrior against the shadow than lets sever men for funz! though with a BA leader of course they would like saidin itself probably tend to get tainted a bit themselves. Still the RAs mission BA membership aside was to handle problems currently which in WoT meant stopping the potential for use of tainted saidin and NOT letting the world get overcome by the shadow. That would have sucked.Re letting men die the taint was an unfortunate situation all around for the men  I hated hearing about gentled anyone male or female especially after the detailed descriptions. So being severed sucked but being bonded to me always read as enslaved from Bk Lan onwards. Seriously Id rather be spun back into the pattern for another go than bonded.So letting gentled men die didnt seem odious again in universe compared to the other options. Sure some RAs were odious but they would have been so regardless of ajah imo.,WoT,cskmflz,1,t5_2rdg1

Even if you had the best show runners that had all the best intentions and funding just keeping all the cast members would be pretty much impossible.  You would probably need to constantly be recasting people that drop out for one reason or another.Take one example of Tam.  You see him early in season one then there would be many seasons before you ever see him again.Another would be Olver.  Between when we first meet him and the final scene with him he would age up by about  years.And the main cast would all have to be willing to put in way more time them most actors are willing to commit too and the need to recast atleast one of them would probably be close to .So if I was in charge of making the series I would give serious consideration to doing it in high quality computer animation or an anime style..,WoT,cstb7ph,6,t5_2rdg1

Their circumstances were much different than previously they were operating under the looming threat of the Dark Ones imminent assault and the knowledge of what had occurred to make the Breaking of the World happen.Another thing that changed the dynamic of the White Tower was the changing structurepurpose of the Ajahs. What need was there for a battle Ajah between the BotW and Last Battle? And Why did the Red Ajah turn into men hating Nazi hunters? That one is actually kind of easier to answer everyone became afraid of male channelers and women who already didnt like men found a home in the Red. The only Ajahs I could see as being necessary are the Greys Yellows and Browns for historical documentations sake.The allgirls club mentality really bothered me the entire time. The men are always wrong sort of thing. That notion was reinforced year after year of there being no male channelers in the White Tower and even in the Fourth Era with the Black Tower being separate from the White Tower.,WoT,ctotr5z,2,t5_2rdg1
4714964,0,t1_ctoteu6,Who knows! Maybe the creator created it that way! Made it so the one power could be used regardless if he is imprisoned or not. Maybe in order to give humanity sentience and souls the Creator had to imbue them with the basic essence of the one power allowing those with a closer affinity to their basic creation to actually wield it. I do not have an answer honestly but I suspect that I am playing the right sport if not on the same field. The Final Battle between Rand amp the Dark One and the similarities between the world without good and the world without evil just led my mind thinking down different avenues. While there was a kind of battle of good vs evil on the fields of Merrilor it wasnt actually the Last Battle. It was a battle for what would happen to the world once Rands battle was actually over and Rands battle wasnt about Good vs evil as he discovered creating a world without evil it was the same basic battle he had on top of Dragonmount.

Everyone tends to say that sharing would be so beneficial but tends to overlook what has happened in the books.  Since he has left the Two Rivers Rand has been pushed and manipulated by Aes Sedai after Aes Sedai.  Not to mention kidnapped tortured and bonded against his will.

However there are tantalizing hints that there exists a realm that either coexists alongside our spacetime.  Weve discovered the particle that gives things mass higgsboson but we have no idea where gravity comes from.  We can observe it and calculate its effects but the underlying cause is a complete mystery to modern science.There is a part of string theory that say our universes Big Bang came from two enormous structures called branes colliding and the energy released in that collision kickstarted our universe providing all the energy needed for us to exist for however long were going to exist.  I imagine that the Bore is an attempt to access something like that.  Modern science is relentless in its search for answers and I have no doubt that  assuming we as a people dont manage to wipe ourselves out or drill into some ancient evils hiding place  well figure out how to get at the realm of the branes and well figure out what actually causes gravity.

She also seems to care about the Aiel herself having become Far Dareis Mai.I think a big hint here is to look at Luc Tigraines brother who somehow merged with the man Isam cousin of Lan and became something new Slayer.  Recall that he can appear in and out of the world of dreams in the flesh.Does Tigraine have this ability as well and is it somewhat related to the body swap or merge? IsamLuc became Slayer. Rand and Moridin became linked when their balefire crossed. Were they beginning to merge? Did Rand in fact merge with Moridin at the end rather than body swap? Is this why Nakomi said something like yes that is what you need to do because she herself had done it when she died on the slopes of Dragonmount? Or because she knew that her brother Luc had merged with Isam?I also want to point out that I think Tigraine and Luc are heroes of the horn Cailan the Chooser and her brother Shivan the Hunter both of whom herald the end of ages.

I dont see one single quote to even barely substantiate some of the absurd claims you make. Both lazy and dishonest.gtLike what? What is one sister or one activity?Cadsuane against the Black Ajah. According to RJs notes on hergtThere are the usual tales expected of a Green only more of them. Riots suppressed and wars stopped singlehandedly rulers steadied on their thrones or pulled from them sometimes toppled openly and sometimes more subtly toppling rulers was something Aes Sedai had not really done much of in the last thousand years but Cadsuane seemed in many ways a throwback. Rescuing people carried into the Blight or kidnaped by dangerous bands of Darkfriends breaking up murderous rings of Darkfriends plaguing villages and towns and exposing powerful Darkfriends who tried to kill her to protect themselves. There are dozens even hundreds of improbable and sometimes seemingly impossible tales.As RJ says this kind of activity is par for the course for Greens. All thats different is that theres more for Cadsuane as RJs notes said. Want to disagree with the author? Fine. But dont say you have facts to prove it since clearly your position has been contradicted by the author.Your problem is that you take a few events from the books and make a broad generalization for Aes Sedai for much of their history. In the absence of other evidence that would be fine. But there is evidence to the contrary from the author the BwB the Companion etc.gtsemipermanent station in the BorderlandsWhere would this base station be? The Blight border is huge and encroachments occur all over. Even if the Tower had  times its numbers and had  sisters on permanent duty on the Blight theres no point. Most years you see small raids all over the place. Large incursions like Tarwins Gap occur sporadically and theres no saying when it will happen. Without Taveling a basecamp makes no sense. You would have Aes Sedai twiddling their thumbs for years on end and even then theres no guarantee theyll be near where they are needed in time.In fact the best base camp IS Tar Valon. It is nicely located south of the KandorArafel border which is pretty pretty close to the middle of the Borderlands. By river you can go deep into Shienar and Arafel and that can be done fairly quickly. And this way you have a concentration of Aes Sedai ready to respond.The problem with the Malkier situation was how quickly things happened. First you had Lain taking a large number of men to their deaths in the Blight. Then Cowin emptied the border forts and the Trollocs came pouring in. According to the Companion There was no time to summon aid from Shienar or Arafel and no hope that Malkier could stand alone. If even Shienar couldnt send aid in time the only way anything could have changed is if  or so Aes Sedai just happened to be stationed somewhere in Malkier. And even then they couldnt have just stopped the kind of massive invasion. They may have saved the Seven Towers and the Capital but the Blights advance could have only been stopped if significant numbers of the Tower could quickly be brought in. gtWhere did Travelling come from? Or terangreals? Or angreals? Or Cuendellar? Are these just devices that only are allowed by the Pattern in the Second Age and when they are needed spun back out at the end of the Third Age? What about Dreaming knowledge? What about real Healing?These were lost during the Breaking before the Tower was formed save Dreaming. For the Tower to have hemorrhaged knowledge you need to prove that the first Aes Sedai of the White Tower knew more than the current ones. We have no evidence for that. gtThe last woman singular to work on terangreal died centuries previously.Yet another falsehood. Martine Janata aka Setalle Anan was the last to study unknown terangreal. Per the CompaniongtShe was the last sister who made a regular business of studying terangreal no one knew the use of. In  NE she was discovered unconscious on the floor of the sitting room in her apartments burned out.Since  NE is  years not centuries previously you are once again shown to not know what the hell Aes Sedai do and are pulling facts out of your ass.gtJust one woman over the course of hundreds of years expressed any real curiosity whatsoever about these thousands of mysterious miraculous devices.This is just your fancy. Nowhere does it say Martine was the ltigtonlyltigt one to do this in history or even in the past few hundred years. Only that she was the last to do so regularly.In fact we know Verin and Anaiya both used the dream terangreal and we know Verin figured out how to use the bookmark terangreal that hides books. We dont know what all the other scholarly inclined Aes Sedai were up to. Certainly Martines burning out cooled their interest for a bit but nothing in the Companion or the books say that no one else researched terangreal.gtThe Tower seems to have crushed human curiosity because the Aes Sedai are literally clueless  years after the original knowledge was destroyed.If you want to say the Tower is overcautious and does not have a rigorous program of research into the OP you are right. But thats not what you said. You said they have been hemorrhaging knowledge meaning theyve continually lost more and more of what they know. That is flatly untrue. They do pursue plenty of research into things like botany history etc. They just dont do as much OP innovation as they should. gtAnd Dreaming. One woman looked into it. There were other Dreamers. Both in the Tower and on the continent among nonchannellers. But just one woman who again died decades ago bothered to research it at all.Again... source? We know Corianin researched it. We know Doniella Allevien was a Dreamer who wrote a commentary on the Prophesies of the Dragon based on her Dreams and that one of those commentaries is what Egwene used to decide the precise moment of the Seals being broken. If you want to insist those two were to only ones please provide evidence.gt years. Look at our own history. Look at what weve dont in  years. Even if you start backwards from before our ridiculously accelerated modern era. The Tower was not starting from scratch either. They had some knowledge and they knew for a fact what was possible. They know Travelling is possible. They know that angreals and terangreals can be created. They do nothing.Firstly our world has not had globe spanning centuries long wars every  years. Even World War  didnt last  years or have the scale the War of the Hundred Years did let alone the  year long Trolloc Wars.Second the Tower didnt start from scratch but they also were the best at preserving the knowledge of the AoL. No one single other organization managed as much as the Tower. Early on their entire effort was focussed on preventing mad channelers and the remnants of the Shadow from overrunning the world. They did spend  years trying to figure out ways to reverse the TaintgtDo they always have to be gentled? she asked. Elayne stared at her mouth agape and she quickly added It is just that Id think the Aes Sedai would find some other way to deal with them. Anaiya and Moiraine both said the greatest feats of the Age of Legends required men and women working together with the Power. I just thought theyd try to find a way.Well do not let any Red sister hear you thinking it aloud. Egwene they did try. For three hundred years after the White Tower was built they tried. They gave up because there was nothing to find. Come on. I want you to meet Min. Not in the garden where Logain is going thank the Light.Heres some more research they did about circlesgtThe Tower studied this for many years long before the Trolloc Wars. I have read every page that survives in the Tower Library of those studies. It was proven conclusively that one woman cannot form a link with another against her will. It simply cannot be done nothing happens. A willing surrender is necessary just as in embracing to saidar itself....If you must know it was the problem of men who can channel that drew them to it. The Breaking of the World was a living memory to some then. I dont suppose even very many sisters rememberit hasnt been part of the required instruction since before the Trolloc Warsbut men can be brought into a circle too and as the circle doesnt break even if you go to sleep. . . .

6016894,0,t1_cy8av1k,So Im not going to go into details about why humanity would be shrinking but I do think that your point about Wisdoms is a bit misguided.To start with I think that you have it backwards most Wisdoms cannot channel. For one thing theyd get picked out by Aes Sedai a lot more often when running into them as apprentices the apprentices would be more likely to be in villages and meet Aes Sedai with the leaders. But more convincingly at the time of the series and generally post Hawking the percentage of total potential channelers is only like  of women. I believe that this includes those who can learn and those who can learn are no more likely to become Wisdoms than normal women. I dont know what the portion of sparkteachable is but we are already looking at under  of the population of women probably well under  of women optimistically . so well under . of the total population plus those that are teachable which happen to get apprenticed and are apprenticed to a woman that knows the techniques to access the Power without actually knowing that they can channel. I think this second group is negligible.So weve already got only a minuscule pool of potential demographic candidates under a quarter of a percent probably by a lot evidenced by the large discrepancy of suldam to damane.  This is further whittled down to the fact that only  survive puberty without conscious guidance.  So now were optimistically around . of the total population as potential Healers. Now to be fair this is abetted by the fact that they live much longer and healthier lives and probably pass down their skills and position to their children who are much more likely to be channelers themselves. But it is still tiny and were not done yet.Because you also have to consider the proportion of women that are actually good at Healing. Many most? have only minor Talent good enough for small wounds and minor sicknesses. And this is even with training Healing is complicated. It can develop naturally but it is probably somewhat rare and probably wont happen with all women who even do have a large Talent in it. Though this is rougher and potentially not a big factor. The Aes Sedai dont even seem to know any birthingpregnancy checkup weaves like the Aiel do which indicates that skills like those are unlikely to be discovered by a wilder. This means that even the Wisdoms that can channel will likely only have a minor affect on the health of their area unlikely to majorly affect mortality rates.Overall the effect of wilders on general health is probably very very small. At the very best most optimistic estimate I can make you have . of the population with any Healing at all and most not enough to make a real difference in local mortality rates.Also we know that contraceptive tea was used but we dont know how effective it is or how widely used it is I only recall Andorans talking about it. Also it could be rare in our own world it is theorized that our own contraceptive plants were harvested to extinction in Roman times so who knows.,WoT,cy8caa9,3,t5_2rdg1

And while thats technically correct its not a very profound revelation. RJ was a big one for hidden meanings that werent easily sussed out. I get what youre saying about Rand and LTT Theyre the same soul the Dragon. And thats true. BUT through a large part of the books Rand fought with LTT in his head.  LTT as a personality actually took over Rands body on at least one occasion and wrested the Power from him on another. Its very like having split personalities.

Further back in the TerAngrael memories we also see a team of Aiel Ogier and Nym including the Greenman his name is Someshta singing the Songs of Growing to make a field of corn or grain or veggies I forget which and they stop halfway through because of the sudden announcement that the War of Power has ended and LTT has beaten the DO. Nym make plants grow because the Aes Sedai genetically engineered them to do so. They also know the songs of growing which Ogier know Loial can do it its Treesinging only applied to other plants growing corn or oak trees or whatever plant and presumably Aiel can learn them and maybe other humans. Rand once he reincorporated LTTs memories gained access to the Songs of Growing which is why hes able to make the plants grow. Mat comments when he sees Rand doing it at the Tarasin palace when meeting with Tuon. Mat hears him singing under his breath when the plants start growing and Tuon gets spooked. Rand then tells Mat to shut up when Mat comments on it. Someshtas memory is limited because he was injured to the head.

6901380,0,t3_4a9yu4,This is an excellent example of Aes Sedai wheels within wheels. On the surface the Hall chose Egwene because she was strong in the Power was not associated with either side of the rebellion and because she had a personal connection with the Dragon Reborn. The last is probably most important only Nynaeve qualified for that as well and they couldnt have raised her. An Amyrlin from the Two Rivers was the perfect statement of rebellion against Elaida Amyrlin from the Red Ajah.On another level the Hall assumed that as an Accepted she would be easy to control. Talk about misjudgement... Siuan herself was raised as a compromise candidate after the Hall were deadlocked and unable to decide so there is precedent for this.Further down there are the hints that Siuan and Leane manipulated the Sitters towards the decision  because they thought Egwene would be the best choice? Or perhaps Siuan was not yet ready to give up her grip on power. She planned to offer her services to the new Amyrlin  and of course the more inexperienced the Amyrlin was the more she would rely on Siuan. ,WoT,d0yl955,34,t5_2rdg1

Wheter he is bending the Weave or just reweaving it as he sees fit it is clear that Rand is beyond the One Power. He does not wants to be able to use Saidin anymore therefore he cant. There was nothing physically wrong with either. Moridin in Rands body has been through so much trauma his soul is probably just broken lost the will to live. Not to mention that he seemed to be a conduit for the Dark Ones power and then was abruptly cut off from it. Rand in Moridins body got better. Whether that was because he needed to settle in his new body or just sleeping of the exhaustion of the Last Battle I dont know. I think he is just remembering what Tam said to him. However one could argue that Egwene touched the Pattern with her Flame of Tar Valon when she mended the damage of the Balefire. And she died doing that. I would say that those circumstances probably allowed her soul to find Rand and tell him those things. That is confirmed yes,WoT,d1ovmei,2,t5_2rdg1

The WH spoilerss Cleansing event is felt by Mats party by  then Perrins by  and again Shaidos by .Of course by now I dont need constant reminders that Cairhien soldiers shave and powder their foreheads they must look quite ridiculous or that they are shorter than everybody else or Nynaeves braid or Sevannas breast size. Or bowstrings  storing them from getting wet or struggling to keep Two Rivers longbows range above  paces wow! away from snow I have learned that thank you.I think knowing every damn horses color or sex isnt necessary either...

The whole first book was a journey out of my smalltown home in Emonds Field into this wider world that I knew nothing of.

8105801,0,t1_d4r4dul,Yeah. I understand why they didnt bother with most of the terangreal but we know the Forsaken were eager for angreal and saangreal and the Tower was an easy and obvious target. Or if not that why not use Need in TAR to find one undiscovered? It worked for the Bowl. In the end I think for the sake of the story they couldnt have the Forsaken be unbeatably powerful.

8105843,0,t3_4q19dr,Thats interesting. For me it was the point where I lost interest. It was the third book that ended with Rand supposedly killing Baalzamon. I was turned off by the repetitive nature of the endings. I stopped reading and didnt immediately pick up tSR when it first came out. Once I did THAT was when I was hooked.

8117730,0,t3_4qei8w,gtOne thing I didnt like about the books was the theme of men being killed but womens souls being broken and their minds being snapped Galina the Aes Sedai damane Graendal etc.. Well every man who can channel initially faces the prospect of their mind being slowly twisted beyond repair.  And theres poor ? Padan Fain whos mind is a wasteland by the end of the series.  Not that its completely analogous but still.I think a conversation between Tam and Rand about his polygamy might have been fun.  So... three women Rand?I would have liked a more concrete ending for aspects of Rands story but I imagine we can infer or make up our own answers.A meeting between Galad and Rand might have been interesting too.  Im not sure how much material there was to mine there though.Speaking of Id love to know what became of the Whitecloaks.  And who is Gaidal Cain anyway?  Did we ever meet him?

Lews Therin takes control of Saidin from Rand and shows us some new stuff.s Showing off his powers to Egwene and Elayne in the Stone lifting them and many objects in the room.s Being collared and controlled by Semirhage almost forced to kill Min then finding the True Power and killing Semirhage.s Using the True power when entering the White tower which was not friendly towers him as a whole to subjugate all the Aes Sedai so that he could interact only with Egwene.s Healing an apple orchard grains in storage growing trees quickly and a few other related small things.Nyneave  s Healing others who were gentledstilled Logain Siuan Leanne.s Healing the madness of Ashaman.s Egwene  s Her defense of the White tower against the Seanchan attack.s Her death at the end using the Sa Angreal staff to counteract Mazrim Taims use of Balefire.Androl  s Using gateways to redirect other peoples spells and to drop lava on Trollocs.s Two way bonding between Androl and Pevara providing a somewhat psychic connection.EDIT This is a work in progress,WoT,d714zj5,2,t5_2rdg1

I appreciate her emotional judgement on things while keeping a rational filter on her reactions. Doesnt take things too serious but knows whats important. Rand. Hes hard to rank without knowing where hes at development wise. But at his core just a genuine person. Knows what hes about whats right should be done and generally a good human. Aviendha. She would be higher on the list if I understood ji e toh better... But I dont. So while shes a humorous bad ass and beautiful I feel like there would be an annoyance of cultural differences ending with her correcting me.  Mat. A tough choice between him and Aviendha. He lost out purely because Im an introvert at heart. His antics and extreme extroverted nature would wear me out.  Egwene. Shes smart reasonable when needed and willing to go to any length to see things through. However this would easily be a rub at any disagreement at all. As previously well documented shes my way or the high way... But I can at least respect that shell talk it out and explain her reasoning. Even if its not always the best. Elayne.

9822018,0,t3_5fx2qy,The series as a whole is definitely a lot more drawn out and dry than Dresden though both are among my favorites. One major difference Id have to say is that Dresden reads like a serial with every book being a completely selfcontained story and plot though with some overarching plots from book to book. The Wheel of Time does not it is one story all through. It is much slower throughout but remains fantastic despite that. RJ emphasized detail and intricacy with many plots taking multiple books to simmer before coming to the fore. Theres also a lot of little things that pop up later in the series that are easy to forget having made appearances earlier in the series. Little hints and twists.I expect youll find most of the series much the same as LotR dry throughout with some parts you have no interest in going back to reread but youll be glad to have read the story at the end.,WoT,dantu5b,1,t5_2rdg1

10370098,0,t3_5odsgj, This is a unique book in that the titular character barely appears despite the fact that he is a main character throughout the first two books and the fact that all of the events swirl around his actions. Rand is going to the Stone to fail and die. Hes sick of being the Dragon Reborn already so he wants to prove to Moiraine and himself that hes not. So he takes the prophecy that he believes cannot physically be fulfilled and tries to fulfill it with no plan. His plan is go to Tear free climb into the impenetrable fortress and take the sword. This is the first book where we see the power of the pattern to bring together all the things he needs to win. Discuss the relation between WoT and Arthurian legend as this is the book where Arthur draws the Sword out of the Stone. You also have prominent appearances from Merlin Nimue Guinevere Galahad Gawain etc. The introduction of an outsider into the ingroup. All of the characters even to some extent Elayne Galad and Gawyn have been dealing with Rand and his fallout for several months now. But then we add a new character  Faile.

Cutting heavily and jamming books into seasons early on in the piece INO would hurt the appeal of the show and you might not even get your  seasons. Also there is no cap on how many seasons a show can run. How long a show lasts is mainly based on ratings and cost v profit no? GoT is isnt being capped at  seasons...its being capped due to reaching the end of the Story.Narg really hopes that if someone is out there writing the screenplayscript that they are only focused on cutting as little as possible to make book one fit into one season and making it as good as they can.

10991655,1,t1_dedtdnz,Some of your points are a little flat.  Im confident that Martin isnt clueless regarding the hierarchy of landed nobles for instance.  Choosing to deviate from actual history for something thats arguably simpler does not equate to a lack of knowledge regarding said history.  Nor do I think that hes unaware of the effectiveness of knights in combat.  He is writing fantasy however and not historical fiction which means that the history of knights in fantasy and how theyre portrayed also play an influence and critically they  form the crux of why he depicts knight as he does.  Id also disagree that the series is cynical.  Martin doesnt hesitate to kill off some of his heroes certainly and some pretty awful things do happen but there are plenty of villainous characters that suffer similar fates.  The core of Martins writing is the human heart in conflict with itself and he portrays that fairly well with the understanding that actions have consequences.  Sometime when playing politics those consequence are severe.  Ill be fully frank I dont think Martins series is that much darker than Wheel of Time.  ,WoT,dedvaxt,3,t5_2rdg1

Their are bad guys who are just doing what they believe in thinking that theyre doing good like Elaida and then there are bad guys who are bad cause its fun like Semirhage. And pretty much every antagonist has a back story and reason for how they ended up. Fain might be an exception to this but hes a nice example for how some people are just evil for no reason.

Despite the temperatures she wore a blue gown with quite a low neckline for Andor though the thick dark braid pulled over her shoulder and nestled in her cleavage kept the exposure from being too great. The small red dot the kisain in the middle of her forehead did look quite strange. According to Malkieri custom a red kisain marked a married woman and she had insisted on wearing it as soon as she learned. Toying idly with the end of her braid she looked . . . content . . . not an emotion anyone usually associated with Nynaeve alMeara.  Elayne gave a start when she noticed Lan a few paces off strolling a circle around them and keeping watch down both hallways. As tall as an Aielman in his dark green coat with shoulders belonging on a blacksmith the hardfaced man still managed to move like a ghost. His sword was buckled at his waist even here in the Palace. He always made Elayne shiver. Death gazed from his cold blue eyes. Except when he looked at Nynaeve anyway.Contentment vanished from Nynaeves face as soon as she learned what would have to be her task. She stopped fingering her braid and seized it in a tight fist.  Now you listen to me. Elayne might be able to loll around playing politics but I have my hands full. More than half the Kin would have vanished by now if Alise wasnt holding them by the scruff of the neck and since she hasnt a hope of reaching the shawl herself Im not sure how much longer shell hold anybody.  The rest think they can argue with me! Yesterday Sumeko called me . . . girl! She bared her teeth but it was all her own fault one way and another. After all she was the one who had hammered at the Kin that they ought to show some backbone instead of groveling to Aes Sedai. Well they certainly had stopped groveling. Instead they were all too likely to hold sisters up to the standard of their Rule. And find the sister wanting! It might not be Nynaeves fault exactly that she appeared to be little more than twenty  she had slowed early  but age was important to the Kin and she had chosen to spend most of her time with them. She was not jerking her braid just pulling at it so steadily it must be ready to pull free of her scalp.Later  She gripped her braidHer long braid swung as she shook her headgiving her braid one firm tugshe would have yanked her braid right out of her scalp.Nynaeve took a grip on her braid with both hands and gave it a steady pull but if her face got any darker she would be yanking her braid and shouting till no one could get a word in edgewise for hours. and her hand twitched toward the braid drawn over her shoulder,WoT,dfbgpr5,5,t5_2rdg1

But I will point out that Galad the one who was supposedly always does right no matter who it hurts abandoned his position at the Tower joined the Whitecloaks an organization Morgase and Elaida had raised him to hate and distrust killed their leader took command and basically reformed them from being cruel and indiscriminate Inquisitors to being crusaders against the actual Shadow.Meanwhile Gawyn stuck faithfully by his duties which caused him to kill his own mentor let Siuan be stilled and end up in Elaidas service all because he obeyed the letter of Tower law.  Then he repeatedly slipped away from those duties to snog Egwene in an inn offered to abandon the Younglings and Andor for her and was totally absent and failed to do his duty as Elaynes brother once she took the throne leaving Birgitte to handle the repeated assassination attempts.So which of these two men is the asshole?

If Egwene had a saangreal... Eh maybe but Id still put my money on him unless she got the drop on him. Which leads into...  In a one on one no funny business fight a man would beat a woman but its basically impossible to have such a fight so it depends on how much dirt they can get on each others respective weak spots  how to catch them unprepared what they refuse to do murr murr I cant hurt a woman murr murr e.g. and so on. Lanfear is super good at finding these things sooo...tough to call.

The weave uses all the elements but it doesnt require strength in all elements to succeed. For instance making Cuendillar requires a weave of Earth Fire and Air. But only strength in Earth is key to its success. Similarly plenty of Aes Sedai with no great strength in Fire have no issues making lightning which uses Air and Fire. Not a lot of women possess great strength in Fire and Earth. But most will have average strength in those Powers making them perfectly capable of doing everyday things with those Powers.

Books allow the reader to fill things in movies impose the directors vision on the viewer.  There is no chance the director will have the same vision as the stuff you made up while reading and rereading the series.If the series is well done in its own right though it will attract more fans to WoT and thats a great thing.  Thats what I experienced with the Lord of the Rings movies.  And now years after they were made as my young daughter both watches the LotR movies and reads the LotR books and I read to her and watch with her I have finally come to terms with Peter Jacksons vision.  Its not my vision at all but they were still good movies and brought a lot more people to the books.  I hope I can say the same of the WoT television series  years from now.

11729345,0,t1_dgpajtx,Feel you on this.  Speaking of Moraine fading Im not even sure why Rand brings her into the cave.  Shes pretty weak on the Power scale at this point. Id want two very strong in the Power w me.  She goes as ceremony... not exactly the time for ceremony. Come on Rand!,WoT,dgpjvij,1,t5_2rdg1

But they should probably be somewhat homogenous because they do come from a small isolated world.,WoT,dgtth5i,2,t5_2rdg1
