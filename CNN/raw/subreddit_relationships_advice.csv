11218141,0,t3_601wux,Regardless of money I would always rather an experience than a physical object. Plus its not like its her birthday its your anniversary so your gift should be about both of you. Of course she may see it differently than me. Maybe you could plan a day of fun romantic stuff like a picnic in the park with all the foods you like to eat together or a recreation of your first date. You could also make her a scrapbook  that can be done relatively cheaply and almost any girl would absolutely love it. Or if she likes sports take her to a game! Also you should give her a card with a sweet handwritten note. Good luck and Im sure youll think of something awesome. ,relationships_advice,df3k9ea,2,t5_2rnv7
11245839,0,t3_5z1zs9,It took me a year and a half to get over my first boyfriend. He was my world. I was sad for about  months then I was just angry with him. I got over him by giving a different guy a chance and I ended up falling for him. It doesnt feel like your first love. Those emotions are irreplaceable but you will love again. It was  months in our relationship that I finally felt over my ex. Wasnt even mad at him anymore. But that doesnt mean I want to ever see him again. He was still an asshole for what he did to me. My advice is give it time. Dont rush things with someone else but you will know when you find someone you like and might give a chance. Edit Im still with this other guy btw and Im happy.,relationships_advice,df6p6ar,1,t5_2rnv7
11330966,0,t1_dfg9xhp,hmm but the lack of eye contact as well? and lack of touching in general? He may not be affectionate but I wonder if its just human nature to want to do those things if we are attracted to someone,relationships_advice,dfgcguk,1,t5_2rnv7

11368278,0,t3_627kfa,Its not right of him to hold this over you. If this job is truly an good opportunity take it. If he truly cares for you he will get over his ego and it can be resolved! Jealousy is a dangerous thing and thats what it sounds like here. Good luck with it all. ,relationships_advice,dfkkm4p,3,t5_2rnv7
11521335,0,t3_64g7o2,Was this girl drunk when you guys were dancing and she gave you her number? Even if she wasnt sometimes girls just say yes to things because its easier than the awkward no. Not sure that this is the case bc it seems like you guys had a great time together. But honestly if she was interested I think she would have responded by now. Just dont text her anymore and see what happens. Its only been a couple days! ,relationships_advice,dg1y16v,2,t5_2rnv7

11615118,0,t3_65ohd3,The next time he is angling the phone away from you tell him to hand his unlocked phone over immediately or the relationship is over. Make sure he knows if he leaves the room in a huff then comes back in five minutes because hes had time to think about it that he is still dumped. He will have used the time to delete evidence. ,relationships_advice,dgcl0yn,1,t5_2rnv7
11648190,0,t3_665kua,It sounds like the two of you need to get reacquainted with each other. Find out what you are both interested in and what you want out of a relationship. A lot of times talking about it again can help bring some excitement back to conversation and also can remind both of you what the other needs to feel satisfied. If one of you feels that going public with your relationship will make them feel more satisfied then by all means go public. ,relationships_advice,dggc4cy,1,t5_2rnv7
11725374,0,t1_dgol6tu,Agreed I need time to process things. The best way to explain it is once its said to me my head repeats it and then I understand it. I do it with everything ,relationships_advice,dgp3o2d,2,t5_2rnv7

11753255,0,t1_dgs6ygk,Im going to have politely disagree with you. Just because a person has been more sexually active than their partner it doesnt mean heshe will deliberately will go out get drunk and make poor decisions. If they have good communication and they have a good foundation of trust then he has nothing to worry about. If hes really worried or simply wants to up the sex then he can always just ask her what she likes. ,relationships_advice,dgs9ekj,2,t5_2rnv7
11798062,0,t3_68c2ck,At the end of the day its about how you feel and if you like them thats your decision. However your family do play a key part in how well your relationship goes as in if they like them it will run a lot smoother. Keep seeing the person but try to train then as it were to act like the person your family wants them to be. Or do things you know your family will like. You know your family well so should be easy! But definitely stay with the relationship if it makes you happy,relationships_advice,dgxcmzr,1,t5_2rnv7
