3413433,0,t3_2zb7cr,hey man that was pretty neat especially the night scene with the dropping pelicans guess the innies had more firepower up their sleeve than expected. keep up the cool videos. i know this was more gameplay related content but i challenge you to go more into cinematic style videos. look into using animations and creating awesome imagery i always found great reward from positioning and timing units properly to get that one good shot. might take you  minutes  minutes or an hour to get one shot in but the reward in the end is so great. either or great video and i look forward to seeing the next one. ps. nobody saw that spelling error at the end P happens to me all the time ,EridanusInsurrection,cphctz4,3,t5_33bvx
