1145740,0,t1_chxzv33,I agree. Try putting larger tires on your TriCross. This should help avoid flats and also help off road handling. I ride c for a mix between mountain and road and its a decent balance. You can try putting  mountain bike tires on it as well if there is enough width clearance.,bikepacking,chyiasp,2,t5_2shbh

4083171,0,t3_37db9n,I dont feel rub unless I ride pretty far back on the saddle. For me to be that far back there is some saddle discomfort that Im trying to avoid after some long saddle time.For other leg rubs  wide frame bags top tube bags etc. I just slightly adjust my pedaling or I end up ignoring it. Its kinda hard to ignore if Im in full cycling kit as the lycra doesnt offer much help. Baggier shorts help a little to numb out the rub.,bikepacking,crlpgqp,2,t5_2shbh

5641035,0,t3_3sda3m,Highly recommend Rouge Panda out of Flagstaff AZ!! Nick is a great guy and does an amazing job. He works very quickly and his prices are great. Easiest part is sending your measurements. All he needs is a picture or two of your bike with a measuring tape in it. He calculates the proper dimensions for your bag. ,bikepacking,cwwbp4b,2,t5_2shbh
5659718,0,t3_3sd5rx,The Sworks fast track is labeled at  grams. Theyre very fast tires. I run the grid version and I feel like theyre quite reliable. As far as smallest packable size... I think a tire like the WTB nanos pack fairly small.you should also check out schwalbe tires. Their racing ralph is very light also around  grams. they also have better sidewalls than the Sworks tires. but are a lot more expensive.,bikepacking,cwyn599,1,t5_2shbh
5971743,0,t3_3x5lve,Cut down to only what you must have. Every ounce can be felt while on singletrack. For water sounds like a l hydration bladder in a pack is your best bet. Get the Kelty down bag I have it and its great. Forego the dropper post for the Vischacha that bag is a monster and always seems to have extra capacity. Youll fit all your camping stuff in there. You might get away with going without a handlebar bag if you go ultralight leaving the luxury items at home. Also get some riding shorts with dual cargo pockets. Another idea is the revelate gas tank Jerrycan and feedbag but those will only help ya with small items. Id suggest finding a  mile route and do an overnight with whatever setup you cone up with to try it out. It took me several trips to dial in my rig. ,bikepacking,cy2fd5r,2,t5_2shbh

7466479,0,t3_4hjwlq,The thing I love about bikepacking is that you can have a really different set up to your friend and still do the same kind of thing. Ok my mates cyclocross style set up destroys me on the climbs but on the downhill my big tyres and wide back swept bars are a riot in comparison. I do however enjoy the simplicity of both bikes and regardless of the geo you settle upon Im not sure an angle set is a particularly wise move. Ive run one on an old dh rig Iron Horse Sunday and serviceinstalled a few in my time and they are a far from perfect way of adjusting your bikes geometry. Remember also that changing your bikes HA by a few degrees will also change things like the trail wheelbase length and BB height. you could end up with a frame that rides badly in both settings. The best way Ive seen to adjust a bikes HA is the Commencal Meta V I think its the V frame. They used a sleeve inside the head tube which could be spun and clamped with two M bowls at the tubes top and bottom. it also means you can run standard headset of your choosing making everything more service friendly. Because of its nature the stack ends up being quite large. Would be great to see youre final designs and thoughts etc good luck! ,bikepacking,d2qw51q,1,t5_2shbh
7516754,0,t3_4dbfgj,I toured the GDMBR last summer.  My lowest gear was  front and  rear with  inch wheels.  I used that gear a bunch on climbs but I was carrying a lot of gear.I just did some quick math.  My billygoat gear worked out to  inches of progress for every crank rotation.  Your lowest gear above will be  inches which is WAY taller.  taller than my low gearUnless you are traveling VERY light and have legs like a track cyclist you are going to want a lower gear ,bikepacking,d2wm8t3,1,t5_2shbh
