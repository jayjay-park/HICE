162017,0,t1_cewthqy,People rambling is why we need journalists. When those rambles are interesting and cohesive in their own right? Thats when you need editors. Its a related but quite a different proposition. Its mostly common sense. If you notice someone rambling thats the first clue that thats grounds for condensation omission or other editing.Another tip I use Inqscribe to do transcriptions there are other options and some free browserbased plugins that do much the same thing. You can load the audio or video and have commands to pause rewind a few seconds etc. If you look in the tracked changes link I posted youll see that occasionally I pasted the timestamp so I could easily return to that point in the recording.

If anything I find people are increasingly critical of news media but far less of sociallyshared news content. Because people tend to trust peers more than journalists.

805258,0,t3_23b6my,Your query prompted me to think about the writers of Wall Street Journals All Things Digital worked under contract. They split from the WSJ and formed  Another who started with a personal brand moved to large outfit and then returned to a personal brand is  Theres a whole emerging issue about whether journalists will actually become brands and operate as independent contractors with the freedom to move name and brand from pub to pub. I dont know enough about this issue as I would like. But if you have a blog with a following and good brand and you see it as a potential revenue source then you want to protect yourself. Linking up with a newspaper may accelerate your brand and profile and help theirs as well since food bloggers can be very popular and great source of ad revenue. Personally Id want the ability to return my blog and brand if I parted company. I might think differently if they bought out my food blog and coupled that with a contract to write for it. But right now it sounds like you would be migrating without an offer so you are the one in the stronger position in a sense. If they arent offering you anything to bring your blog to their platform it seems entirely reasonably that you should keep the brand. Will you be giving up ad revenue that you now make on your personal blog? The All Things Digital writers and they left in one big group werent able to keep that brand. The WSJ retains it. I dont know how ReCode is doing maybe its a rousing success I just dont know. But having to rebrand seems like a risk. Congratulations I must say for putting yourself in this position to begin with. Its an interesting issue and the editors must think well of your work to offer. ,Journalism,cgvt83e,2,t5_2qhym

981980,0,t3_25cpt6,Thank you for bringing this up I think a lot of people out there agree with you. The reasons you give are exactly why its always important to read critically no matter the source. Critical reading reveals that some media outlets and individual journalists are more committed to the pursuit of truth than others. What independent means to answer your question is that publications have the right to cover the news without government censorship. This is a relatively new idea in the history of humanity and although weve hit some speed bumps we can see this protection from government censorship in action every single day. It is therefore up to the readers to hold a publication accountable for reporting fairly and accurately. Readers can do so by choosing to read only credible reporting and gasp! paying subscription fees to publications they want to support. Again it is very important to be a critical reader to identify credible reporting. But the point is these publications are generally free to write whatever they want. The good ones have their finances spread wide enough that they dont care about losing any given advertiser in fact the most successful media outlets are moving away from advertisement models altogether so the consequences of upsetting any one person are less severe than you might think. There are problems with this whole system and journalists are fighting to improve them but this is the general idea of an independent press a press that can do whatever it wants.,Journalism,chfwqod,-1,t5_2qhym
1016986,0,t3_25qllc,News organizations tend to use blogs for quick bits behindthescenes stuff and plugs for articles in the paper. Generally its stuff that doesnt warrant delivery to the general readership of the publication.For example our political reporters might do a blog post describing some surprise announcement with a plug for a full writeup to follow.Sports reporters use blogs to explore geekier stuff that the average readership might not bother with such as indepth statistical analysis or just goofy sidestories.But generally blogs  and by that I mean those of nonprofessional writers and socalled citizenjournalists  are held in low regard. The vast majority of them are poorly written badly researched opinions with zero factual credibility. The term citizenjournalist suggests a person with the unfounded conceit that journalism is a profession anybody with a laptop can do better than the pros. Those of us who have dedicated enormous time and effort to doing great journalism recognize the skill and resources needed to do the job right. Real quality journalism is a fulltime team effort.Would you trust a citizendoctor a citizenelectrician or a citizenpolice officer? If you dont believe journalism requires training skill dedication and effort then you would make a lazy unskilled journalist.There are a few decent independent journalistic blogs run by dedicated individuals but they are exceptionally rare.

But Im saying that as someone who really likes a good story. If you find that coding is more of your calling then do that. And if you have the ability to do both then great do that.

Its cheaper to tap someone a few times a year rather than pay a contract or have a staffer somewhere.And dont forget there are dozens if not hundreds of more experienced and talents journalists who want those same few freelance articles.So the bottom line build up your chops Good luck!,Journalism,co2but8,1,t5_2qhym
2987250,0,t1_co730xm,Okay this is going to take some explaining.Well first Im not going to touch on your politics. Not why were here though Ill bet dollars do doughnuts that youre an Ancap or failing that Libertarian. Very distant third Teaparty. Nobody else uses Statist like that.I will give you advice regarding it though  get a handle on it mate. Judging and looking down on people like that will severely damage your ability to be a journalist  people dont want to talk to that guy people want to talk to someone who will listen to them without being judgmental or insulting them and trust me youre not as good at hiding it as you think. And if people dont want to talk to you youre a bit fucked.Now on to the actual meat of it. Ill touch on your replies to other people too mostly to save a bunch of different comments and trying to keep each one straight.Well start with picking better examples first since thats the most important.First RT is a giant fucking heaping steaming pile of  that should be burnt to the ground and have the ashes pissed on by lepers. Its not just Russian Biased its literally the governments bitch. Putin says Jump and they say How high should we tell people we jumped? It is not a media outlet its essentially a propaganda tool of the Russian government.Using them as an example will go against your goals because if the head of your department either knows RT or bothers looking into it hell probably think poorly of your critique.VICE isnt any better theyre just awful in different ways instead of propaganda its a fauxnews outlet under the control of an advertising company. To keep this under novellength theyre a godawful narcissistic hype machine where the journalists are dictated toand on some occasions fired by the advertising department. Theyre incompetent  Their editor got a source arrested because he broke basically every rule of Source protection  for the sake of his own ego. They freely modify stories make them up buy and bribe their way into stories when they cant find anythingincluding bribing their way into the aforementioned story where Rocco got the source arrested and they treat their writers like shit to boot because if they fire one theres a legion of clueless young writers out there for them to pick from who will accept the shithouse conditions because they dont know any better and think because VICE is a big name theyll treat them well.Im not amongst the crowd however who look down on them for being partowned by Newscorp. Murdoch doesnt have a controlling stake and I dont personally believe that at this time he has muchifany editorial control. I could be wrong but thats just what I think.If you use Stephan Molyneux or Russel Brand then youve immediately sunk yourself and might as well give up for a while and hope he forgets the whole exercise so you might try again in the future. Molyneux is seen as a strange conspiracy theorist crank who amounts to nothing more than a cult leader and basically little more than a conartist and completely insane who panders to an audience that includes hardcore delusional paranoiacs racistsits no secret hes well loved among the same sort of crowd that youd typically find on Stormfront and other assorted people on the hard outoftouchwithreality fringe of things.Russel Brand a Pseudointellectual narcissistic tit a blind and idiotic populist who doesnt even have the common decency to pay lipservice to what he preaches let alone practice it and whom is considered impressive primarily because hes used to speaking competently and sounds like he swallowed a thesaurus rather than having anything useful compelling or even coherent to offer.Remember youre fighting an entrenched model and not just the head professor but the department and its curriculum as a whole. You need to play smart so as much as you like or respect these people theyre not the examples you want.You want an excellent example of new media with a nontraditional funding model thatll impress the shit out of your professor?Fucking Buzzfeed. No shit.Their funding comes from their listiclesWhich are not clickbait I might add so if hes even vaguely new media savvy use the term Listicle to impress and carefully vetted advertising along with monetisation of youtube content. There is a very tall very thick wall between their funding content and their journalistic output  even thicker than traditional outlets have between Advertorial and editorial.Their output is consistently some of the best in . Their investigations have been knocking it out of the park and theyve uncovered some pretty serious shit  for example the conartist who the US government have contracted for Ebola Cleanup which is also likely a scam or the Serious financial malfeasance of top NSA officials. So if he goes and looks at their news section and investigations hes got something impressive staring back at him.Their newsroom is fastpaced and skilled keeping up with and integrating new media along with the traditional wires and theyre not afraid to reach out and try new things.Finally not only do they treat their staff extremely well theyve also managed to attract some Major talent. Two pulitzer prizewinners  Mark Schoofs and Chris Hamby from ProPublica and Center for Public Integrity respectively  and one of their Data Journalists was nominated while on staff. Theyve got Lisa Tozzi of the NYT Ben Smith of Politico Doree Shafrir from New York Magazine Shani Hilton one of the most respected journalists on the Hill the list goes on.gtyou are the odd one.Get used to it mate. Theres nobody normal in this business. You me the guy you were talking to were all fucking weirdos of one stripe or another. Some just hide it a little better than others.gtentity they are funded and controlled by has a muuuuuuch different one could easily argue OPPOSITE agenda to that of the western media.Being funded or controlled by a different entity doesnt nessissarily mean theyre worth listening to. Especially considering that in both the case of VICE and RT writers have been fired without hesitation for actually following that Scientific method when the truth contradicted the outlets preferred line. Even at the worst of the worst traditional outlets they dont fire staff for not being onboard with the party line.gtRT is the reason a lot of that information does eventually make it to western mediaUtter horseshit.As three final points for now  I might come back to it later but Im so hungry Id damned near bite the arse out of a low flying duck so I gotta do something about thatFirst think primarily in terms of your course and how it prepares you for the modern media. Dont worry so much about how anyone else  RT Vice Buzzfeed anyone else  are doing it because youre not there youre in School dealing with your course thats the important thing to deal with.Second take my advice with a grain of salt investigate for yourself. I  nobody in this thread in fact  know where youre studying or who youre studying under. Our advice may not specifically apply to your situation perfectly. Dont be afraid to modify advice to better suit the situation youre in or toss it if its not helpful.And third real quick  dont give up. Nothing that big and entrenched will change overnight. Theyve shown a willingness to listen now youve got to show the patience and go through working with them to improve things. Listen to them in return. And dont fuck it up. Youre not just doing this for you youre doing this for those that come after you who will benefit.,Journalism,co7mj3z,1,t5_2qhym

10212832,0,t3_5m8kz5,Sports and videogame journalism which are combined in esports are crowded and notoriously hard to break into.  If I really wanted to do that sort of reporting Id write every day with a commitment to learn one thing that improves my writing on each of those days for example pick writing a first line that really draws the readers in one day and search and destroy redundant or unnecessary words the next  Do that until your writing is tight and engaging.Then Id read every single thing I could find by top journalists who are covering the same subject matter you want to do not with the intent of ripping them off but to get a feel for the tone and cadence readers of that kind of content like.As for social media its pretty easy to post material on any social media but in my field city beat facebook dominates.  Pick several facebook groups related to what youre interested in make sure its ok with the moderators for you to post links to your articles and politely post without flooding the group.  There are specialized groups Im in that will net me a thousand hits on a posted link with the right article.  That may not seem like much by the standards of the better known writers but thats just for one posted link.  Bear in mind that the content theyre clicking into needs to be engaging and wellwritten or they wont come back.The other thing is to go to all the events you can and try to meet the wellknown personalities and land interviews and quotes.  Dont be obnoxious but dont be shy either.  Edit as an example of this I spent all day yesterday in obscure government working sessions one involving shudder a county thirtyyear comprehensive landuse plan.  From twelve hours of alternately going to these meetings and writing. I netted three boilerplate articles only one of which will get more than a hundred hits.  But the valuable thing is that in hanging around at these meetings I got to chat with planning commission officials got easy access to the new chairman of the Board of Commissioners the top county official and most importantly got to know one of the tech directors for the county who offered to expedite open records requests for the audio of meetings to me.  This may not translate directly to the kind of writing you want to do but the same thing applies.  Work the hell out of your beat.These are just off the top.

It is important to give people the ability to say what they want to say without risk of silence or persecution.  The issue comes into that there is active silencing because people want their content tailored. The intent is to let everyone write and hopefully one of the unpopular ideas is actually a good one.  Taking into example Martin Luther King when he first started was largely misrepresented and banned from many journalist publications. The Big NewsLeaks is great. We are looking for that notoriety.  We do have a lawyer that did establish the company as an LLC and explicit information entailing that we are not responsible for any content that is posted on multiple portions of the site.  As far as law is concerned we should be covered. There is also no verification whatsoever because there is really nothing to verify in the first place.  when creating an account there isnt a single moment where you are required to provide personally identifiable information.

Maintaining servers and paying for bandwidth is orders of magnitude cheaper than running a press.When you hear that journalism is dying youre hearing about a twofold problem. Traditional print journalism companies are losing subscribers and more importantly advertisers to the web. No ones reading the print product so no ones advertising on it and when they are advertising online its for fractions of pennies on the dollar for what they used to pay to advertise in print.. Web startups either do not yet have enough journalists with institutional knowledge of the subjects they are covering because they mostly rely on college graduates or arent paying enough for their journalists to work exclusively for them full time which is required before those journalists can devote the time and effort necessary to do great hardhitting investigative journalism. You cant spend eight hours a day poring over court documents or sifting through gigantic reports if you have to churn out three more stories for the website by the end of business or are juggling two other writing jobs to make ends meet.Had the first online journalism outlets  newspaper websites  banded together and all charged for access from the start wed probably be in a very different scenario.
