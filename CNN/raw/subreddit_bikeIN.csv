840928,0,t1_cgzt48y,I typically ride on the street as well  just for the safety of those using the muliuse path. Its not fair for me to go  MPH on a path like that. However its important to consider that a new generation of cyclists needs to be bred and at  years old the roadway probably isnt the most comfortable place for them.,bikeIN,cgzv6ua,3,t5_2w5su
851429,0,t3_23q4ra,I would be happy with  lanes two each way. The inner two for passing and the outer two marked as shared bikes and cars.  I think it would be a start.  But I am easy to please kind of guy.,bikeIN,ch128xt,2,t5_2w5su

2278562,0,t1_clt8uzn,Ive tried pulling into the middle of the lane and Ive tried pulling all the way left and I havent found a position where they dont try to pass me when Im speed art the sign. If theres oncoming traffic they just swerve back into the position I currently occup. Ive had a couple good ones where if I dont pull out of the lane completely Id have been run down.,bikeIN,cltckks,4,t5_2w5su

7665766,0,t3_4kaeu5,You know part of me really dislikes bike to work day.  I saw a guy almost get creamed by a Jeep this morning on Mass Ave and would have entirely been his fault.  I followed him from th to Alabama and saw him doing stupid stuff the whole way.Screw both those dudes.,bikeIN,d3djy6m,4,t5_2w5su
7842969,0,t3_4mqsz1,I actually was just looking at that last night. Im pretty sure you have to have one in order to be legal but Ill risk it over the embarrassment of ringing a little bell. Most of the time people have headphones in or Im riding with cars who will never hear it.,bikeIN,d3xm9j9,-1,t5_2w5su
8252431,0,t3_4sfau4,Along the same lines as the Nickle Plate Trail you have the Cardinal Greenway which starts in Marion and goes to Richmond.Indy has a pretty extensive urban trailgreenwaysharrowbike lane network.And Southern Indiana has a lot in the way of mountain biking perhaps start with Brown County State park.Also I dont have any links currently but Ohio has an extensive Rails to Trails network.  Its very close to linking Cincinnati to Cleveland. ,bikeIN,d593yfy,1,t5_2w5su

11645077,0,t1_dgfe4d0,I ride my TCR to harrison all the time and always heard they have nice trails. I have been taking the Tow Path more since owning a cross bike. Much more comfortable than on psi tires. Ill check the side trails next time Im riding around there.,bikeIN,dgfzenu,1,t5_2w5su
