The same could be said of nt mf mb... I could transpose this knowledge for initial nasals and allocate them in a syllable of their own however Im still held back by the fact that the clusters appearing in the middle of the word have vowels preceding it thus not acting as prenasalised stops.

270045,0,t3_1x728n,I understand that youre trying to gloss over some of the details of philosophy of language by using a casual term like thought blobs but there are lots of different ideas about what the Language of Thought LOT is what its made of or whether one even exists. The stuff of thought is something worth talking about and your mind control point about some thought being translated from one mind to another is important and well taken but be careful about the way you talk about it. You might throw off or frustrate the people who actually work on and think about that stuff i.e. philosophers of language.Second your description of the lexicon is a bit simplistic and possibly misleading. I understand that you want to gloss over some detail again okay and its true that theres still lots of argument over what the lexicon is how its structured etc. But you go so far as to claim that ideas are directly mapped onto sounds. That might not be the case or at least be too strong. Itd be a very unusual stance to say that ideas are coordinated with phones at least. Maybe ideas are hooked up to phonemes. Or to feature bundles. And maybe those features are alongside other types of features say syntactic and semantic features. Or maybe the idea to phoneme relationship is mediated by those other types of features. Who knows! Not I certainly and probably not you. Its cool and worthwhile to talk about the lexicon as a complicated thing but simplifying it in this way without at least referencing the complexity andor ongoing debate is pretty misleading.That said the rest of the video was pretty well taken. I think uQichin is overstepping to say front page of everything  I dont think its that good  but its wellspoken and quick and if it makes some people take a second to think about what they say and how they act towards others using language then its got value for sure.

503705,0,t1_cfxfaj8,Hi. This is just not true.Its approached differently than with IndoEuropean but its not significantly more difficult. The comparative method doesnt require a phonetic script. But then there is still phonetic data encoded in the writing system. Judging by your username Ill assume you know some Chinese. So historically I can look at  simplified to  and explain phonologically why the phonetic component in the simplification is  instead of something representing Mandarins rang or you can say why niang  and rang  share the phonetic components even though they dont have similar representations in modern Mandarins phonetic script pinyin in this case. Or why  is ni but  is er. These characters all have phonetic information as part of the glyph So even if we were relying heavily on written phonetic representations Chinese would still not be disqualified.gtLoanwords are common and are easily assimilated into local phonetic normsMuch like any other language? Actually Mandarin loan word phonology still shows clear signs of the phonological features of the source word. Here are a few examplesgtShort words which become unrecognisable when a single sound changesI really dont know what this is supposed to mean so Im not sure how to address it. Do you mean something like ran n would be unidentifiable as either z or ln or na? Because it can be any of those depending on dialect and its always identifiable. In part this is because of predictable phonological changes. In part its because words rarely exist without clear context and more importantly its a myth that Chinese words are monosyllable. So ran is actually just half of the word ranhou  so in context if you hear nahou youre gonna know what it is.,linguistics,cfxiw93,17,t5_2qhos
507622,0,t1_cfxiw93,Im very far from being an expert in either Chinese or historical linguistics and just dashed off a response in a free moment so yes youre probably right on many counts there and I did vastly oversimplify or overstate.Having said that a couple of points to clarify     Chinese has a phonetic element this is true  however this is fossilized at certain moments in time and provides a clue rather than a clear description.   I did say that the first phonetic script was Hangul which is completely wrong sorry.   Aware that Chinese words arent the same as individual characters however the morphology allows sounds to switch around much more than in many languages and plenty of words are monosylabic anyway.   The point here is that were talking about thousands of years ago rather than hundreds for any possible splitting its easy to see the progress of acquiring loanwords from English but how about from  years ago or ? We have some examples but nowhere near as many as for IndoEuropean languages and this has to be a clue as to why weve got so many Isolate? on the langauge map around here.,linguistics,cfxywto,2,t5_2qhos

Shanghainese a dialect of Wu went from being fully tonal to a system that is now much like a pitch accent system. I would guess the latter doesnt fit with what youre looking for but the former might.One thing that can happen is vowel lengthening to make up for the loss of phonemic tonal distinctions. In other cases such as Mandarin tonogenesis occurred in the first place as voicing was lost in initials. Were voicing to be reintroduced the tone system could fall out of use. A number of Mandarin dialects now show Wulike initial voicing either as the result of contact or else as something that was preserved from when Middle Chinese made such a distinction. One in particular is a Mandarin dialect that has now developed a pitch accent system like Shanghainese which is not at all like the tonal system of Mandarin otherwise.Chicken and egg though.I cant speak for languages that were once entirely tonal and are now totally atonal.

1932079,0,t1_ckkxnqw,Id like to back up ultsas in saying that you can get away with reading only the parts of papers you need but that it depends on what you need the paper for and in what stage of a project youre in. First everyone needs papers for different things with their projects. Sometimes you just need to know some pieces of data or sometimes you might just need to steal borrow some bit of formalization. When grad students and professors say that you can get away without reading the entirety of the paper this is one thing they mean that if you know what you need to get out of the paper you can skim or skip the rest of it.The second thing is related to the first. Depending on where you are in a project or how experienced you are in your subfield you might not have to read everything in a paper. If youve already read a lot of work on telicity for example reading the background section of a new paper where it carefully lays out the Vendler classes isnt worth your time. If youre trying to get the lay of the land in a new area say degree semantics Im not convinced that reading entire papers is useful either what you need to know is the core data rough sketches of the approaches and the major names Cresswell Bierwisch Kennedy Heim Klein etc before returning to the major papers and getting bogged down in the details.If youre reading for class Id recommend reading the entire thing since the professor has picked this paper out specifically to illustrate particular points.,linguistics,ckm02bu,1,t5_2qhos

I personally believe its best to view these diachronic and synchronic morphosyntacticphonological and semantic processes as tools whose results can and ought to be revised in light of evidence provided by other disciplines and should be considered as part of a larger academic while including the same.

2131663,0,t1_claoxg6,Holy thread necromancy Batman!I would be very interested in seeing this solid evidence because I have been studying Germanic linguistics for a long time now and have never heard anything about this. First off these Semitic speakers would have to be in the right part of Europe northern Europe near Jutland and southern Scandanavia the approximate region of the protoGermanic urheimat and one would think they would have left traces in geographically proximate languages say the Uralic and Celtic languages we definitely know to have influenced ancient speakers of Germanic and intervening languages to say nothing of interesting archeological traces. Unless they teleported there one sunny summer Bronze Age evening.Secondly I dont know what unusual sound changes hes referring to Germanics sound changes are not unusual by the standards of the IndoEuropean family and arent outside the sort of sound changes that would be expected. Its grammar reductions I suppose they mean the changes to the IE verb system primarily arent particularly unusual either and are in line with other IE languages attested from a similar date.Thirdly while much hay has been made of Germanic vocabulary and early observations that a substantial portion seems not to have come from PIE stock cf. the socalled Germanic Substrate Hypothesis subsequent research has led to such characterizations of Germanic vocabulary as being at best somewhat overblown and IE etymologies for many previously supposed nonIE words have been found. I dont think anything like  of the Germanic vocabulary is currently considered nonIndoEuropean.It smells like bullshit frankly.,linguistics,clas4xv,1,t5_2qhos

2219485,0,t3_2kjmg7,From the perspective of my students who are in the process of learning about syntax and morphology right now there is almost no useful information to get from the entries. Its really not something I would recommend they look at.First for any particular morpheme its useful to know what it means but if I pull up a morpheme like ize there is no meaning associated with it. Second what you do get is incomplete and misleading information. ize isnt a verb it forms verbs from nouns and adjectives. Maybe this would be forgiven if the gloss was consistent but the plural morpheme s which should fall under the same assumptions and be glossed as noun simply has no category information with it at all. Third theres no indication of how the things are pronounced or whether there is any allomorphy. For instance any adequate list of morphemes would make a note that im il ir and in are all allomorphs of the same morpheme but the former three arent even listed. The fact that neither of the uns in English are listed is also a particularly glaring gap. Finally theres not any example sentences or even example words which is a pretty big turnoff for linguists.Incidentally theres at least one somewhat extensive list of affixes out there affixes.org and also a smaller list Yehuda Falks list of affixes These are among the better dictionarylike things for affixes Ive found online.,linguistics,clly79r,13,t5_2qhos

Firstly the training in question isnt particularly specialised or complex and Im in fact advocating that it should be taught early on as soon as people are taught any grammar. Secondly combustion was just one specific example of a semantically noncanonical noun that I at least wouldnt view as a thing  I was just trying to point out that some cases could be problematic. More generally Im claiming that people without a syntactic definition of noun and here I dont think thing is adequate different people cant be relied upon to consistently use the same definition even if they do arrive at a syntactic definition.

It took me less than one minute to think of that.gt In this case when you move determiners somewhere else they are no longer determiners by definition. Please provide the definition of determiners that you are assuming which would exclude the determiners in my example.  It sounds to me like you are making assumptions about what is and is not possible regarding the placement of determiners in a language...so you believe in a UG after all.gtMany languages conjugate verbs for gender or definiteness for example its not that odd to not have those always next to the noun. Stranded prepositions are not that different from your example either.That is entirely irrelevant.  Every linguist knows about agreement and the existence of discontinuous constituents in language at least on the surface.  I provided a specific example to respond to a specific question and that is the example you need to respond to.gtThere are more problems with your example. There are no spaces in speech so it would be nearly impossible to hear if its the a a the or the a the or the a a a the and so on. So change the to gi and a to pa to make it easier to hear the difference.  Again youre sidestepping the issue.gtyou lost the position of the determinersNo the position is maintained.  Here is what I saidgtevery determiner is stacked at the left edge of the sentence in the same linear order as the noun phrases with which they are associatedand gtlets also ensure that every noun phrase has some type of determiner so there will never be any null determiners that could lead to confusionIt is simply a matter of pairing the leftmost determiner with the leftmost noun phrase the second with the second third with third etc.  So the position of determiners in English is entirely recoverable.gtthat would add ambiguity with verbs names or adjectives that sound like nounsThis type of ambiguity already exists in language and in a language like English word order frequently helps to disambiguate.  If youre really concerned about ambiguity we could add different suffixes to every word category to avoid the ambiguity thereby creating a language more effective at communication than English due to decreased ambiguity but still unlearnable due to the determiner stacking.,linguistics,cn1c41b,5,t5_2qhos

If true it would mean that sour is probably an intrinsically bad taste that weve managed to turn into an enjoyable one. So its probably very common for sour to be associated with bad things.As for it actually being universal I highly doubt it.

3848078,0,t3_34i4lk,Yeah seems pretty bogus to me. By Wells theory Oceanic languages which are generally limited to V and CV syllables would be CVC C. Oceanic languages generally prefer CV syllables so much so that when words arise that historically ended in a consonant there are two different synchronic repairs. One is to insert an echo vowel after the final consonant CVCVCgtCVCVCV and the other is to delete the final consonant unless a vowel is added for some reason thus revealing thematic consonants.It would be crazy to analyse the syllables CVCVCgtCVCVCV as CVC VC V. If you look at syllable structure typology you will quickly see that languages prefer to have stuff in the onset than in the coda so his whole system seems crazy.Furthermore as was recently posted Steriade one of my all time favorites has recently proposed an approach that discards the syllable for an interval. I am not sure how popular her theory is but just to say that if it is correct theories of syllabification become kind of irrelevant.Edit removed the part about it being prescriptive. ,linguistics,cquwy2h,1,t5_2qhos

Sanskrit means the artificial language or more accurately the language created by human laws. The Sans in Sanskrit is a cognate of e.g. Sansad parliament and Prakrit means the natural language cf. Prakruti the natural world. This references the fact that Sanskrit has very explicit and rigorous grammatical rules whereas the Prakrit languages were more natural spoken languages without explicit grammars. Also Prakrit was not one language but a catch all word to describe any local language. So people in the region of Magadh spoke Magadhi Prakrit and people in the region of Awadh spoke Awadhi Prakrit.

4054836,0,t3_36znbw,gtOr shortly explain what systemic functional grammarlinguistic is all about?Systemic functional grammar is a view of language as a resource for communication. The choice of your utterance is made among the options offered by language namely the finite number of constructions and grammatical relations and the open system of lexical items. There are also metafunctions one of which which relates to the internal organisation of a set of utterances forming a structured collection of linguistic signs a text. Genre and register are two aspects of the textual metafunction.Register for instance relates to the social associations relating to various linguistic resources which count when you make the choice among the linguistic resources. Some ways to say things are socially associated to formality and informality and these associations therefore carry semiotic meaning and therefore they factor in your choice of utterance.,linguistics,crihcwy,12,t5_2qhos

4135738,0,t1_crlre8k,Disclaimer Im not a linguist yet. But Im pretty sure Ive read enough to try and answer your question.I had some problems with this too a few years back. To me I thought the distinction between words and morphemes were kind of diffuse. The thing is that the two arent mutually exclusive a sound carrying meaning can be a morpheme but it can also at the same time be a word.There are several types of morphemes but in general its the smallest meaningcarrying unit of a language. Sometimes morphemes can stand on their own autosemantic and sometimes they need to be attached to another morpheme synsemantic.Boy is an autosemantic morpheme meaning that its also a word. Boys is the morpheme boy with an added synsemantic morpheme s to indicate plural. You can see here that s does carry meaning however its not a word on its own.Sometimes a morpheme can change the meaning of a word entirely. Im not  sure what its called in English but in Swedish we call them derivative morphemes avledningsmorfem. An English example of this is ness as in sadness. ing as in running is a morpheme too which changes a verbs meaning to the present participle.So if you had the same problem I had it really isnt that much deeper than the regular smallest meaningcarrying unit of language.

4234039,0,t3_38y1ls,Yeah the Monier Williams is the only place I see jivana translated as butter or marrow. The source for both these uses is nontextual lexicographers are where those meanings came from in his dictionary. Since it tends to be equated with life or even soul jiva in Jainism and the source is from lexicographers Maybe theyre homonyms in certain areas but with some underlying conceptual relation? Marrow is after all life in a way and in Hinduism the cow is sacred it is the giver of life through milk and thus butter. Milk is also in Monier Williams as jivana but the source there is Demetrius Galanos. So its possible in that case it is textual as he translated parts of the Bhagavatapurana. Im really reaching with the attachment of marrow and butter or milk with life here though...could be jivana has totally different lexical meanings with no relation or Monier Williams was just wrong to include these definitions...,linguistics,cs2v9wj,2,t5_2qhos

If a group loses their language youll hear people describe it as a loss of their self. I dont have the study on hand but places where native languages are retained are generally better in any ways and have lower rates of suicide than those places where a minority culture has lost its language. This is almost certainly not causation but the point is that a healthy prosperous culture is one that retains a unifying language which is why genocide includes the destruction of a language and why the EU lists a unified language as a requirement for a binaries nation.,linguistics,csjz476,3,t5_2qhos
4427137,0,t1_csmwaee,No not really. Well it depends what you consider older. Irregular verbs tend to follow older patterns that are no longer productive i.e. new verbs are not formed on those patterns. In English older forms are based on an ablaut system and the suffix n see  saw seen. The newer pattern is ed google  googled  googled.However does this make them older? Help used to have irregular forms based on ablaut help  holp but later was regularized to helped. So I think you can argue that helped is a newer form than say saw but help is still a verb right out of the ProtoGermanic.Also some verbs gain new irregular forms via analogy strive  strivedstrove  strivedstriven compare drive  drove  driven. Bring compare sing broughtbrang  broughtbrungNative speakers still coin new irregular forms sometimes dranken boughten spatten etcThese forms are newer and irregular.tdrl some irregular forms are older but that doesnt mean the verb isnt old just because it has regular conjugations.

But sometimes when Im smiling I touch my lower lips to my teeth and make a sound instead. Are these two separate sounds in linguistic categories? And do any languages utilize both of them separately?That is called a labiodental nasal as opposed to the more usual bilabial nasal Since sound is a bit too vague to make the relevant distinction it is a different phone but in an overwhelming majority of cases the same phoneme As you can read in the labiodental nasal article there are very few languages that utilise both of them separately making them different phonemes.gt Second questionIts mainly the girlygirly nature of the character and the highpitched speech so she pronounces both  and  a bit more openly than say a stereotypical samurai would. They are still distinct even if her  sounds like a dock workers  her  sounds even more open than that so there is no miscommunication. can be pronounced as ga or as a not na!. This is the same kind of sound you would have in English sing and not in sin. In some dialects of Japanese g is sometimes under certain rules pronounced like this it was considered more educatedrefined to talk like this especially in Edo Tokyo and north of it however it is disappearing mostly sticking around with older people and in newscaster speech.

The point is that the apostrophe inserted in a place where I expect a syllable break as in alMeara or eKieron helps mentally reinforce the idea that apostrophesyllable or glottal stop. This is doubly reinforced in words like Goauld and DoUrden where the apostrophe inserts a break that wouldnt normally be there. Trying to find rhyme or reason is straying a bit from the original hypothesis. FWIW I think that in the case of both eKieron and alMeara the e and al act as prefixes indicating some sort of social standing. Oh another example from Jordan. Theres a group of people called the Tuathaan. Again the apostrophe there indicates a syllable Tuathaan rather than a contraction. Dont ask me why because I dont know what linguistic rules if any Jordan had set up for himself and his world.If I thought about it some more Im sure I could come up with many more examples of words in fantasy amp scifi where the apostrophe indicates a syllable or glottal stop. ,linguistics,cv5z9n5,1,t5_2qhos

For example peuttre gt ptetpate damande gt patdamandepas de travail gt pas dtravailrite de passage gt ritde passageIs the shortening the succession of the two sounds or is it another sound entirely ? like for jsais which becomes chais with kind of an accented ch sound rather than just j then s. Likewise tout  lheure becomes ttaleure and it seems to be some sort of accented t but i dont know enough about phonetics  to know what sound it is.Also im interested in the recent evolutions of French verlan for example but i dont know where to look does anyone have ressources on this ?

5574142,0,t1_cwlxikk,When you say proper you have to understand that the prestige variety of German pronunciation differs depending on the region and the origin of the speaker.For example in Northern Germany a coronal R produced with the tongue tip as part of a strong northern German accent will be just accepted while a trilled R without a northern accent might be scorned as a feature of a southern variant which have lower prestige the further north you get.Within Germany every kind of R that you associate with the letter exists. Theres uvular trills fricatives approximants and coronal trills taps and approximants.  In the area formely covered and surrounded by Prussia as well as western Germany south of it the dominant form is a uvular fricative or approximant and a coronal sound is associated with either ruralness old age or foreignness. They are not per se considered less correct however theyre just marked. In all other areas the dominant form is a coronal trill with a uvular trill as a regional minority variant. Including Austria where the uvular trill is for example part of the dialects of the rural south though apparently its not common where you live.But none of these variants are wrong according to the Duden guide which is probably what one would take to define proper for Germany since its legally binding for at least the spelling of all countries but Austria. Except maybe the coronal approximant which might not even be mentioned by the Duden.The same is true for vocalisation in the end. While the reduction of r to a is a common feature for most of Germany as well as many speakers in Austria its not actually required. Pronouncing a full R in the end of syllables is perfectly fine and is still common in Bavaria and Austria and is still the only standard as far as I know in Switzerland.So all in all dont occupy yourself with your Rs unless you want explicitly to conform to the local prestige variant. What you speak might be considered improper by your fellows but how your fellows speak would be considered improper to wrong by many people who are not from there since the northern standard dominates most TV productions in Germany and is often mistaken to be the most correct form by speakers who have little exposure to the standards of other regions. But in the great picture theyre all equally correct since theyre all native variants or the literary language in some place or another.,linguistics,cwo0v7p,2,t5_2qhos

5908278,0,t1_cxqahys,In Received Pronunciation  and  have clearly distinct vowel qualities as explained by British phonetician John Wells here and here RP being a traditionally prestigious variety of English though less so nowadays and one of the most studied by phoneticians the IPA transcription of English having been developed largely with RP in mind it is easy to see why they were considered different phonemes and assigned different symbols. From Wellss first postgt For example unorthodoxy ndksi sounds different from an orthodoxy ndksi. A hubbub is always a hbb never a hbb. A large untidy room  ld ntadi rum is different from a large and tidy room  ld n tadi rum.For those speakers of English who dont make the above distinctions including most Americans as well as many English and Welsh people Wells would say that they have the STRUTSchwa Merger.The  and  issue is somewhat different because on the one hand in the major varieties including RP and General American their vowel qualities overlap while on the other hand  has a tendency to merge with  almost completed in Australian English. In fact because there is no vowel quality difference between  and  besides what you would expect from any stressedunstressed pair the usual view would be that  is not a phoneme but a shorthand for the unstressed vowel that can be either  or . But I see why the OP brought this up.

6008296,0,t1_cy76a33,The facts vary from language to language so its hard to give a language specific example without knowing which language youre interested in. Simplistically speaking the head noun controls the person number and gender marking on the determiner and adjective and the argumental position subject vs. object controls the case. So if Im partially understanding you correctly then there two aspects to your question.First you need to look at agreement for a string D A N the determiner adjective and noun can agree in person gender and number. Second once you have determined the agreement facts you need to further examine the case paradigm for that language and see whether there is case agreement. See So in a maximally productive agreement language you can have asgm.nom proudsgm.nom atheniansgm.nom mansgm.nom in subject position where sgm is third person singular masculine assuming man is of masculine gender in that language and nom is nominative case.

6013305,0,t1_cy7rpql,Thisll be a quick and dirty explanation mostly for the sake of conveying the complexity of sandhi in Songjiang. Songjiang dialect is a dialect of Northern Wu which is mostly intelligible with Shanghainese though actually these days there are few speakers left since Songjiang has seen rapid urbanisation in the past couple decades being a suburb of Shanghai.Also this will assume you have some knowledge about tone in Chinese more generally but if you want me to define or clear up any of the terms used below let me know and Ill be happy to clear it up.Songjiang has  tones. There are two level two rising two falling and two checked tones. The pairs split into high and low based on if theyre yin or yang register tones. In this way Songjiang has ended up with a tone system of amazing symmetry which reflects almost perfectly the Late Middle Chinese tone categories and voicing split.Looking just as disyllabic words  not verb phrases for which theres a completely different sandhi system which Ill skip over for now  you have a system where when two syllables join together in one word either one or both of the syllables will become a different tone much like whats happening in Southern Min except in this case it could be either first or second syllable or both and not in such a clean chain like Min has.The pairs are yin and yang versions of the four main categories ping shang qu and ru. A yin tone will never become a yang tone. They keep their register distinction. But the ping shang qu ru categories do change.If you have two ping tones the first one changes to qu and the second one doesnt change. If you have a ping followed by a qu then they both change the ping becoming qu and the qu becoming shang. But if its a shang followed by a qu youre going to get two different patterns based on if the  ping is yin shang or if its yang shang. So yin shang followed by qu either register will become qu and shang the same as the pingqu combination but if the shang is yang shang then both syllables become quIf the first syllable is ru nothing changes. If the second syllable is ru nothing changes unless the first syllable is shang in which case the shang becomes qu but the ru stays unchanged.Both shang and qu have different rules for if its yin or yang on the first syllable but ping never cares as the first syllable.Then as I said this is just for single words of two syllables. So  read book meaning to study as a single word will follow this pattern. But if you say  readbook meaning to read a book as a VO phrase its going to have a completely different sandhi system applied where the second syllable retains its original tone completely but the first syllable the verb in the VO construction will neutralise.Thus while in Mandarin you cant tell read a book apart from to study when theyre both  in Songjiang you absolutely can theyre distinctly different words on the tonemic level.This is why its often said that Wu has the most complex sandhi in Sinitic and its people who are familiar with Min tone circles that are usually the ones saying it.,linguistics,cy7vf5f,3,t5_2qhos

6575764,0,t1_czs6oo5,Grammar is surprisingly fluid and superficial and the transition from Latins SOV syntax and case marking to the SVO and non case marking Romance languages over the course of  years is not surprising in the broader context of historical linguistics. A more reliable litmus test is the establishment of regular sound changes that govern the transformation of core vocabulary. For instance the letter c before front vowels went from k in Latin to t in Eastern Romance and ts in Western without exception as far as I know. In this regard the descent of the Romance languages from Latin is very firmly certain. During the mid st millennium Germanic tribes migrated into essentially every Romancespeaking territory so undoubtedly there is considerable Germanic influence in the Romance languages and many other changes brought about by ongoing chains of causation in the grammar. However the drawing of linguistic relationships is about contiguous descent and very gradual influence from Germanic languages definitely doesnt mean that modern Romance languages didnt organically and contiguously descend from Latin.On the flip side the similarities between Latin and Korean grammar are  coincidental. Even more grammatically similar to Korean are languages like Tamil Turkish and Hungarian but its not been established that they actually spring from a common origin. Certain features like SOV syntax agglutination and complex case systems run together and even cause one another for reasons I wont get into here. Latin incontrovertibly descends from PIE a language with little similarity to Korean.,linguistics,czzhkym,2,t5_2qhos

6933930,0,t3_4aojsq,Its clear that youre starting at the very beginning. You will learn a lot while you do this project if you do it well. You will have to learn some basic linguistic concepts such as language family and some facts about language history.I think that you need to start with defining what you mean by ancient languages. The word ancient is a vague one and can mean different things to different people. You probably want to pick a specific historical periodfor example all languages spokenwritten before a certain year. gtDo all the ancient languages have common ground?Ancient languages were just as diverse as languages todayand possibly even more so due to many languages having died out in the postindustrial era. You should learn about the concept of a language family which is a group of languages that are descended from a common ancestor. Ancient languages belonged to many different language families just like languages today. They also have many different grammatical features. The only common ground they have are things that we expect all languages to share.gtIs there a common sound in spellingwording?No ancient languages share no special connection with each other other than the fact that they all existed in a particular time period if thats what you mean. gtHow many are there?This depends too much on your definition of ancient language to answer. If you mean all languages spokenwritten before a particular year though we cant answer it. Many languages were never written and we have no evidence of their existence anymore.gtDo we know all the ancient languages?No. In addition to the languages that we have no evidence for there are languages that we only have limited evidence for. We know they existed but we dont know much about them. Minoan is an example of this.gtIs there a full alphabet for each one?No some were never written some used writing systems borrowed from other languages that did not include all the needed sounds some did not use an alphabet at all for example Ancient Egyptian. gtAre there examples of modern languages being made off of ancient languages?That depends on what you mean by made off of. Almost all modern languages are descended from an ancient language. Modern Chinese languages are descended from Old Ancient Chinese for example. Modern Greek dialects are descended from Ancient Greek dialects. The Romance languages are descendants of Latin. And so on.This brings us back to the concept of a language family which you really should read up on.There is one case of an ancient language being resurrected Modern Hebrew is a reconstructed form of Ancient Hebrew. This is a very exceptional case. The only ones that were not are creolesmixed languages formed by more than one language coming into contact or constructed languages created by a person. These are a very tiny minority. ,linguistics,d12acm9,9,t5_2qhos

Basically adding that extra vowel breaks up the consonant cluster so the consonants end up in different syllables. Or to think of it another way the various Romance languages ended up with simpler syllable structures and basically you either keep the s by adding a vowel somewhere or lose the s to conform to the syllable structure.So e.g. Latin sco.la gt Pt. es.co.la etc.EDIT obviously there are consonant clusters in modern Romance languages just not ones of the form sptk for the languages in question. So another way to think of it is that s is hard to hear before a voiceless stop so sticking in a vowel makes it clearer that theres an s there.,linguistics,d1wotar,2,t5_2qhos

People can obviously do arithmetics in their head as well but you dont have measures of that either. The fact that we dont know how the brain does it doesnt trump the obvious behavioral evidence that people DO perform arithmetics.So he fact is that there are displacement phenomena in language happening with some regularity which have to explained by some theory and theories based on a metaphor of movement are a type that has been successful for a while.

7328899,0,t1_d2b8b8a,What I meant was that the way the consonants and vowels are explained are very different to how they are explained in traditional English books. Im talking about Arabic and in Arabic its very canonical. All the consonants and vowels were pretty much described and set in stone a long time ago. The way sounds are taught as regards what the processes are when a letter in enunciated are very much the same now as they were centuries ago. Pretty much even the same works are used to teach them. This is very different to English. The way they explained how we explain phonemes today for example was completely different. I simply wanted to know if oblique fitted and if not what I could use instead. I was trying to adapt the Arabic explanation into English. The reason Im hesitant to use the e explanation is because the whole reason Im explaining it the way I am is to explain the way its taught in Arabic. And Arabic doesnt have an e vowel so Im constrained so far as the vowels I can use to explain it. I have to use the a and  to explain it because my explanation simply doesnt have the scope to include an explicit e as that is the very thing Im trying to explain. Im explaining the description of how to get to the e vowel as opposed to explaining the e vowel itself if that makes any sense.To put it really simpleWhat would be a nice and succinct way of explaining to someone in laymans terms how they can go from changing the a vowel into a e vowel. Im talking about explaining the e relative to the a vowel. Not individually. Relative to it.,linguistics,d2b8v8v,2,t5_2qhos

Im not sure if this is the right thread or even subreddit for it though so if Im in the wrong place could someone please direct me to the right one? Thanks.So I often get asked where I am from because of my accent. Recently I was doing some research into how to properly pronounce the letter r in the Japanese language Im currently trying to learn Japanese and a lot of the references I saw explained how it was different than the r in the English language. This prompted me to do some research into how to properly pronounce it in English. According to all the sources I could find the r sound is apparently made primarily with your tonguesimilar to a d or l? If this is right no one ever explained that to me my entire life. I have always pronounced r with my teeth similar to a v or an f but with my teeth slightly farther away from my lips. I dont even know what to say... Its not important enough for me now to learn an entirely new way of speaking. I dont feel like its worth the effort at this point in my life Im  and it doesnt cause any problems but if that is the entirety of my speech impediment it would have been extremely easy to correct if someone just explained it to me when I was a child... PS. I think I learned to pronounce it this way because as a child my rs sounded like ws and instead of taking me to a speech therapist or whatever my parents just had me practice it over and over. gradually my teeth must have gotten closer to my lips instead of my tongue curling up.,linguistics,d2geshp,1,t5_2qhos

7465651,0,t3_4hik19,Orthographies are typically broken into two extremes for cognitive psychology research on reading transparent and opaque. SpanishItalianKorean would be on the transparent end while FrenchEnglish are in the middle and logographic systems like Chinese on the opaque end. Note that even though two languages use the same alphabet they are not necessarily equally opaque or transparent.Children learning to read a transparent orthography typically begin reading much earlier than children learning an opaque orthography with even a two year difference. Typically developing children catch up eventually but even as adults they can adopt different reading strategies. Opaque orthographies use a larger grain size like a viewing window of attention for viewing words as the lexical route of access recognizing the word as a whole instead of from its individual components is more important. Transparent orthographies can have a smaller grain size as they can have reliable phonetic decoding. These attention differences can be measured experimentally as well. This doesnt mean one reading strategy is betterfaster than the other.Overall the most transparent orthographies with direct correspondence between phonology and orthographic unit will be the fastest to acquire. BUT literate adults may rely on the reading strategies they have used in their first languages so learning a new writing system for them will be different than for a child learning one for the first time.If you want to read more about this I think your best bet would be to look up literature on dyslexiaits these researchers who make the theories about grapheme to phoneme access and debate the particulars.,linguistics,d2qsr06,2,t5_2qhos

7804183,0,t1_d3szebl,FYI the word referent usually means what you call the refere. In any case pronouns usually take the same conjugation even when their reference changes.

In French this is seen with vous which keeps a single conjugation pattern regardless of whether it refers to one person or more and similarly with on which does the same thing.Im not sure what you mean by genus but I suspect you mean gender. Gender and number are very different types of noun properties. Gender  in languages that have it  is a feature that is specified in the grammatical information we keep in our minds about each word whereas number is not. Number depends entirely on the facts of the given utterance there is no inherent number in most words except for pluralia tantum words like pants or French ciseaux. Additionally nouns and personal pronouns are quite different in terms of agreement strategies. Since personal pronouns carry no inherent gender but instead must agree with something else. There are a variety of things that they can agree with including grammatical gender and social gender. Grammatical gender is inherent in the lexemes but not in the referent so a word like victime in French will always be feminine and trigger feminine agreement. Social gender is the role associated with a sex in a given society such that we might say Any registered nurse can be trusted to know her stuff. They can also have agreement with referential gender whatever is being referred to in the moment. In Welsh this type of gender agreement is allowed such that if you had a feminine noun referring to a man you could use the masculine See Motschenbacher  for a more complete explanation.,linguistics,d3t92di,2,t5_2qhos

8064222,0,t3_4pni0p,Im not an expert but as far as I know Irish dwindled because its use was strongly discouraged under British rule in favour of English. This meant that its use slowly dwindled in the East where the English presence was greatest as time went on. Then the Famine in the s affected those in the poorer Irishspeaking west causing many Irishspeakers to die or emigrate.I think it is not unreasonable to say that the prospect of a United Ireland is a very long way off. I think the recently achieved peace is too fragile to risk a border pole. At the moment a border poll would just open old wounds.In Northern Ireland the Irish language is highly politicised. It is associated with Republicanism and as such many Unionists are very hostile towards the language though there are some efforts to try and change this perception. In the Republic learning the language at school is compulsory whilst in the North it is taught only in a very small number of schools. As such very very few people in Northern Ireland have even a basic grasp of the language and there are virtually no areas where it is spoken on a daily basis.Personally Id quite like to learn Irish but I dont currently have the time or resources to do much beyond read a little bit about it.,linguistics,d4mhtnj,30,t5_2qhos

Kachru presented a model of English varieties around the world with England the US and a number of other older former colonies comprising an Inner Circle. More recently liberated former colonies such as India are grouped into the Outer Circle where English may be widely used and a first language for some. Finally theres the Expanding Circle such as Japan or Sweden where English is primarily learned as a secondforeign language and used in comparatively limited contexts.From there move on to Schneider  who presents a stage model describing how English moves from a secondforeign language largely defined by Inner Circle norms to a fullon independent variety in its own right. Singapore for example is described to be in the th stage endonormative stabilization where norms for use are no longer solely coming from outside the country but are being established by the speech community within.,linguistics,d5ehzdl,17,t5_2qhos

You can speak your language all you want. I have nothing against people individually or collectively seeking to preserve their own language or more generally to change language in fact I would support it if our law in France allowed for greater efforts in that direction from local authorities in regions where theres actual demand for it. But I find it inappropriate from a foreigner to deride a countrys lets use country if youd rather have that contribution to collective culture based on their perception of local linguistic diversity.Im thinking of for instance how Breton people in historically Gallospeaking areas tend to identify more with Breton than Gallo.Look just as you appear to take it personally if someone tells you your language is worthless which I didnt I take it personally when you say my country would contribute more to collective culture if we were speaking all our regional languages. I am personally perfectly happy with my ancestors choices of language this is none of your business and yes when you tell us that youre inevitably going to come off as a stereotyping romantic.gtIf the entire planet was filled with white English speaking protestants that wouldnt make WASP culture less rich. It would make the collective culture of the human species less rich because theres only one fucking culture. How is this difficult to understand? I assume you mean American WASPs since to my knowledge white and protestant arent really defining cultural traits the former isnt a cultural trait at all. If the entire planet was filled with a certain narrow social category from a handful of countries yeah I guess it would be pretty boring but its also not a very realistic scenario. Im not even sure that collective culture would be less rich if the world was simply filled with Englishspeakers it seems to me that they would find all the ways of expressing and differentiating themselves theyd want and that the unprecedented possibilities of mobility and communication would result in unique cultural development. But thats not even what were talking about. Were talking about linguistic diversity disappearing locally in favour of somewhat larger language communities. I would argue that this shift is in itself a rich cultural phenomenon and that those larger groups participate just as much just as much not more  not that I think it makes sense to use more in that context in global culture.,linguistics,d7nkmmw,1,t5_2qhos

Ideally Id like to release through Steams Early Access program because working towards an expansive manyfaceted game before making anything public is not very realistic marketing and developmentwise especially given the fact that this is a oneman effort. The EA program has a mixed reputation but I feel that is largely due to the fact that some games are far more suited for it than others.

I definitely prefer that over something big all of aspects of which are in an obvious work in progress state. The game doesnt really do any speech recognition Im afraid.

9283841,0,t1_d8sqfy5,Yes. ProtoMalayoPolynesian did something very similar.gtThe MalayoPolynesian politeness shift was considerably more complex than the English one but one of its elements was the replacement in PMP of the ProtoAustronesian second person enclitic possessor singular su thy by the corresponding PAn plural mu your. At about the same time the plural mu was disambiguated from the singular just as speakers of some English dialects use yous or yall for the plural in one of two ways. It was either reinforced by the addition of the PAn second person free singular pronoun iSu thou giving PAn muiSu which by regular sound change became PMP muihu or it was replaced by PAn niiSu ofthou becoming PMP nihu. Also Spanish had quite a lot of politeness shifts but it was also a much more complex process than that of English and there are many regional variations to this day..

9327603,0,t3_586o2f,Scientific terms are much less likely to have a definition. Scientific terms often have to describe things we dont understand by just putting a label on an entity we posit to explain phenomena. Whats the definition of dark matter? There isnt one dark matter is whatever stuff lies behind the gravity that doesnt produce electromagnetism. Sure we can kind of point at discrepancies in measurements but thats not a definition. But thats not actually a problem of the lack of knowledge about dark matter we know a lot about electrons but theyre also nothing more than the label of the entity we assume have the properties needed to explain things like curving cathode rays and atomic spectral lines and to fit into atomic models along with protons and neutrons. The electron doesnt have a meaning that can be defined in isolation of these experimental and theoretical notions. Concepts in science get their meaning out of the network of relationships they pertake in in a wide network. This network doesnt provide a definition either or it wouldnt be possible to discover new things about the electron. A definition of the electron would mean if we discover new things about the electron then there would be no such thing as an electron as it wouldnt be satisfying the definition anymore.

9355970,0,t1_d91qopb,. The problem here is that you are suggesting that the vowel in the same word is simultaneously short in some dialects and long in other dialects without addressing the origin of the vowel. As I noted the very limited textual evidence suggests nah originated with a short A sound which would then be lengthened in various dialects. The trend in English is towards the lengthening of open vowels not shortening them.. The point that I was making is that since the word in question arose informally when it was first coined it had to be written in such a way that the reader has a clear idea how its pronounced especially in a language like English with an enormous amount of dialect variation. You might be skeptical of this difference but what is the difference between eres a ca o nine tails say this in Hagrids voice and heres a catofninetails if not an attempt to render local realization? Therefore because a nah is clearly a phonetic attempt to render the word and b the attestation is so late we very likely have early examples on tape I really think your claim that it originated as a long vowel is suspect to say the least.. The fundamental point youre missing is that the vowels in cot and caught are not the same vowel for me. I knew I was stretching with saw because even when I wrote it I could feel they felt different in my mouth but I wanted a short aw where I have a tendency to lengthen them. Naw by the way so reanalyzed uses the saw vowel and not the cot one.,linguistics,d91xq9b,1,t5_2qhos

9413099,0,t1_d993lf7,gtWu Chinese is the Chinese branch but Shanghainese is generally considered the representative of it well Northern Wu since Wu Chinese is more of a language family I cant understand Wenzhounese at all but it would be considered Wu Chinese. Yes Shanghainese is representative only in that its the largest dialect group of Taihu and yes WenzhouOujiang is drastically different and has a lot of Northern Min impact but really within any language family if youre going to see at least that much difference in that much distance.gtTheres not exactly a wealth of information on the topic thanks PRC so its hard to really say but there can be multiple languages within a family if northern Wu Chinese would be classified as a family. Theres actually a huge amount. The PRC didnt actually do much to prevent scholarly work from being conducted on Wu. If anything organisations like the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences promoted such work at least going back to the s through Li Rong. And of course you have considerable work done by people like YR Chao prior to the start of the PRC and all the foreign scholarship. Anyway theres a lot out there.gtIm not excluding a language by saying that my native language is Shanghainese. Somebody who speaks Suzhouhua can easily say that their language is Suzhounese etc. Northern Wu works as a classification I guess and we could call it one language but that ignores the huge differences there are between the various city dialects. I think the point of confusioncontention here is that youre saying Language to mean Shanghainese and Im saying Language to mean Wu and thinking you saying Shanghainese means you think Shanghainese is the whole shebang. I see that Ive misread that a bit. gtIts a bit misleading to call Suzhounese Shanghainese and Hangzhounese the same language.I dont actually think thats the case at all. Any more than calling divergent dialects of English the same language is problematic. This is a matter of opinion of course but again I think this difference of opinion is what I misread as misrepresentative in your earlier comment and Im happy to set aside differences of opinion.Moving on though because I do have a question for yougtthe Wu branch of Chinese is very broad in comparison to the other branches and includes a grouping of languages and dialects that are far more different from each other over a spectrum in comparison to other Chinese branches.What are you basing this on? On what grounds can you say Wu has greater internal diversity than Hui? Or as a lower hanging fruit than Min?The point I want to make on this is that you get a lot of people saying things like Cantonese sounds like what Li Bai would have spoken coming from Cantonese speakers or Wu is closes to the Tang dialect coming from Tang speakers or Min is the oldest language coming from Min speakers. On what grounds other than pride of native language is the claim being based that Wu has greater internal diversity? Yes Wenzhou is held up as the crazy language by people across China e.g. with stuff like  or more absurdly the surprisingly widely held belief that Wenzhou dialect will be used by future codetalkers when China next goes to wargtIf you consider Wu to be the language then that ignores speakers of languages like Wenzhounese which is essentially gibberish to anybody not from the area. Again a difference of opinion but I dont agree. If you consider that Portuguese is a language it in no way ignores or invalidates Cariocas or people from Mozambique or speakers from East Timor. I would argue that if you say Shanghainese is a language even though I know what you mean the average person is just as likely to think you mean that Suzhou dialect is a corruption of Shanghainese. And before you say no remember that people very much do say things like Nanton Mandarin is a corruption of Putonghua.gtIf you consider Northern Wu to be a language you ignore the differences between hangzhounese Shanghainese Suzhounese etc. Shanghainese was influences a lot by the other cities though and they are closer now as a result of Mandarin influence.I guess the other point with this is that our audience right now are people who might not know that the whole language isnt just Chinese that there are people who are asking Oh do you speak Chinese or Cantonese? or people who say Oh I dont want to learn the Cantonese dialect of Mandarin. Yeah that last ones absurd but thats how little people know about Chinas linguistic situation. For me calling Wu a language has a very specific goal create a realisation among people who dont know much about the subject that theres more to it than just Chinese and Cantonese or Mandarin and Cantonese. Wu speakers are a massive population. More speakers than CantoneseYue. And yet most people have never heard of it. Even in China there are people who have never heard of it regardless of which of the many names you use to describe it aside from just saying .Additionally if you can get people to recognise the shared heritage of the Wu culture area and the Wu linguistic region theyre in a much better position to resist the very real threat of MandarinisationgtAs for your other point yes that is true. Its a sign of the failure of the government to provide for these people in more than just language but it is most definitely a sign of some failings in the spread of Mandarin.You cant have the latter without the former unfortunately.Anyway tldr I think were on the same page on just about everything.

In the words of my Phonetics professor while taking about them These all pretty much sound like uh to English speakers.Also not just sounds that arent found in your native language but features that are not contrastive in your native language. For example Korean was a three way stop distinction. Neutral aspirated and tense although pitch also plays a role in the last two especially with tense consonants. Since voicing rather than aspiration is contrastive in English it can be difficult to perceive the difference between these sounds despite the fact that they exist in English generally as allophones of the same phoneme. So hearing the difference between  which can be produced with or without voicing and usually still with a some amount of aspiration if unvoiced and  which has comparatively more aspiration can be particularly difficult for speakers of languages with no distinction between aspirated and nonaspirated stops.,linguistics,dcsd6xv,1,t5_2qhos

We investigatedthis phenomenon in spontaneous and read speech samplesrecorded from three generations of Parisian French speakers.Acoustic measurements indicate that the majority of vowels inread speech samples are at least partially devoiced and shownoise between  kHz. Devoicing and closure occur only invowels that are in Intonation Phrase final position and carry alow IP boundary tone. Male speakers in conversation showedthe least devoicing.

We interpret the devoicing and closureof the vowel as the effect of an increased articulatory releasebefore pause.gtFaygal amp Moisset  Sound change and articulatory release where and why are high vowels devoiced in Parisian French?gtFagyal and Moisset  suggested that vowel devoicing in standard Frenchoccurs most often in phrasefinal high vowels. An experiment testing the effectof both immediate segmental context and sentencelevel contextual factorswas conducted to further identify the linguistic features involved. Six Frenchspeakers were recorded reading test sentences. Devoicing only occurred insentencefinal vowels but in more contexts than expected. From a crosslinguisticperspective the distribution of devoicing in French is unusual. Finalposition is prosodically prominent in French whereas in many languagesdevoicing is a form of vowel reduction associated with lack of prominence.Different physical mechanisms may therefore be responsible.gtSmith  Vowel devoicing in contemporary FrenchEdit fixed quotations.,linguistics,ddmtf2v,29,t5_2qhos

There are over  German dialects and most of them have a correspondingly different accent.You may be suffering from confirmation bias not because you mean ill but because youre only really capable of hearing an accent difference in a language that you know. For instance you can often tell a person is from India or Pakistan. Get to know a few dozen people from various PARTS of these countries and I guarantee youll start hearing the difference in their accents as they shine through their English. A person who grew up speaking Urdu sounds way different than one who spoke Tamil or Hindi or Bengali. Now a lot of these people were probably learning English in a way taught to them by the British so you get a lot of their regional variation minimized through rigorous training. But thats changing quickly especially as many Indians push to learn English in a more American way.From my perspective as a multilingual person the US strikes me as not really very diverse in native accents and fairly typical in foreign ones. I speak German so a Chinese person who has learned German still sounds Chinese to me when they are speaking it!

11377191,0,t1_dflhjod,I mean Im a graduate student in linguistics and you can basically do this as a direction of your studies depending of the institution. Most of the time you have to be a graduate student to take field methods but I bet if you were a motivated juniorsenior you could take it.My situation is pretty weird Im a pretty old linguist and Im only studying Linguistics as a minor but as a masters student if that makes sense. So I just took a Field Methods course and honestly if I had taken that class when I were twenty its probably what I would be doing with my life.The long and short of it is that youll have to get your PhD but your PhD will basically be a grammar of the language. I bet a way to approach it would be to find someone whos a specialist in an area and be like hey any gaps that need to get filled? Like is there a particular feature that is contentious and needs filling out? Boom. Masters degree. Then go from there.Something to think long and hard about is exactly where you will be studying. And think of the languages that will be undocumented. They will be poor and rural and documenting them means living in those places. In the Amazon this means living in places where you are literally two weeks away from creature comforts that you may be used to. I mean what do you do if theres literally no electricity?That having been said I was thinking about how I could do field research as a hobby and my professor pointed out that there are almost certainly individuals or even groups of underresourced languages in most majormetropolitan cities in the US.Field research was without question the most rewarding experience Ive had as a linguist. I would also advise trying to do it in as small a class as possible. I had three people in my class the other two are probably going to do field research for the rest of their lives those bastards and you really got one on one time with the person every week which is very important. It can be very very painstaking. Every hour of classtime especially when youre training your ear means about  hours of analysis. I became very very close with my classmates.I hope that gives you kind of a framework. Its definitely doable but you really have to focus on it. A lot of it is about getting to know the language family knowing what to look for. Like the language I was studying has velarpalatals. As an English speaker those pretty much sound like velars and weI wouldnt have caught it except for me just kind of scanning the Wikipedia page for the family not the language. Thats CHEATING!. If we had caught it late in the game it would have been an absolute nightmare.

Did heshetheyit eat yet? and so on but the actual meaning can be grasped through paying attention to what subjects are mentioned in the conversation during what times.Same with homophones. There are a huge number of homophones in Chinese if you focus on syllables but in terms of actual words which can be multisyllabicwith disyllabic words being dominant in Mandarin homophones arent as much as a problem and context again disambiguates. There are loads of characters that can be romanized as shi in Mandarin with varying meanings like teacher poem wet lion corpse and to lose but many of these cannot stand alone as words in conversation so in the cases of teacher lion corpse and to lose you have laoshiteacher shizilion shiticorpse shibaito face defeat or shiquto losean object or quality. Only in the cases of poem and wet from the examples I gave could shi stand alone to represent them as monosyllabic words but disambiguating between the two can be done easily through word position the subject of conversation etc. much like homophones in English. The same applies to other Chinese syllables where most of them cannot stand alone as words anyway and the rest can be understood in their intended meaning through context.,linguistics,dg88w14,67,t5_2qhos

And unlike in English it is possible to write each component of a disyllabic Mandarin word as its own separate character and each character is also sometimes called a word even if it may not really be one. Im guessing that generally this is what OP is talking about.Wikipedia suggests there is just  English syllable that maps to  words and thats the maximum while weve already seen multiple Mandarin syllables with dozens of possible words.Anyway perhaps limited phonology isnt exactly the right term here but its not as though OP is a linguist cause if he was he wouldnt need to ask this question.,linguistics,dg8o4tn,18,t5_2qhos

11719103,0,t1_dgnh92m,Parsers can be probablistic  that is they can assign a probability to grammatical rules or they can rule governed.A nonstatistical parser depends on a grammar to parse input.  It then processes input either topdown ie it assumes for example that the input is a sentence and that it will therefor seek a noun phrase according to the rule S gt NP VP or bottom up ie it will read a string from the input and try implementing a rule that starts with this string.In either case some parsers will then back up if they hit a dead end in applying the grammar rules and try another attack on the input.Trained linguists differ in the way that they analyse sentences  they design different grammars for the same languages.  Parsers  at some level of abstraction  implement grammars.  So you can have different results from different combinations of parser and grammar.  There is a complication her in that at least some parsers do not explicitly represent grammars  the parser represents the grammar indirectly see for example the famous Marcus parser parsifal.These rule governed parses will always produce the same output representation for the same input.The quality of output of course varies on different parameters    how good is the grammar?   how good is the parser?But there is little reason to believe that the quality of the output is related to the language of the input as such.  Some languages may be simpler to parse in some ways than others but if we can write the grammar in some formalism and its parseable we can parse it.  All known human languages are parseable.,linguistics,dgoe0ia,2,t5_2qhos

11783288,0,t3_678vmm,Ive read in passing several times that Southern American English is resistant to the weak vowel merger or that its in a transitional state. This was quite surprising to me as the weak vowel distinction sounds extremely British to me so I had thought I would have noticed it without reading about it if there are any SAE speakers out there who could record themselves saying some minimal pairs that would be awesome!. Anyways is AAVE also resistant to the weak vowel merger or in a transitional state? And if so is it considered a generally conservative feature within AAVE or widespread across the country?  kind of how like at least anecdotally Ive only noticed the whinewine distinction and sometimes the horsehoarse distinction among especially rural Southerners as opposed to those living in Northern cities.,linguistics,dgvo9tr,3,t5_2qhos

11798467,0,t3_68alme,Not in the slightest. Both Hind and Urd use two different scripts the former an Indic script and the latter a PersoArabic script but they share the exact same grammatical structure and rules including phonology. The same can be said for Panjb which has a twoscript system similar to HindUrd. The lack of representation of short vowels in the Urd script and in Panjbs Shhmukh script has not had any phonological consequence whatsoever. Moreover there are no Arabic phonological rules that have crossed over to Indian languages that utilize the Arabic script because it was Persianspeaking Turks and Afghans that introduced the PA script to India in the Middle Ages not Arabs. Now there has been some degree of Persian influence on Urd phonology note Im not talking about loanwords but again its got nothing to do with the script.,linguistics,dgxeaom,8,t5_2qhos
11805047,0,t1_dgy3932,gt I like to think Hindustani vowels are messed up because of the ambiguous script rather than being so flexible for no reason at all. But... English has worse ambiguitiesinconsistencies and yet natives dont follow spelling pronunciations except for rarerliterary words. How do you explain that? Native speakers always learn to speak before they learn to read or write. Always. And nobody is a native writer. I strongly disagree with this idea. Quite honestly it makes no sense to me. Are you seriously suggesting that the way native speakers pronounce words is made to conform to spelling?You also have the example of the demonstrative pronouns in Hindi. Theyre written wahve and yahye but theyre always pronounced woh and ye with the singularplural distinction existing solely in writing.You give spellings way too much credit. Id have imagined that English wouldve served as a strong counterexample. gt Hence even more reason to consider the Urdu script to be the cause.Naah not really. Such quirks appear in other Indic languages too ones that have never used the Perso Arabic script. Marathi and Tamil off the top of my head. Hell Tamil is so diglossic the written standard is based on a th century grammar IIRC that words spelled with one vowel in the written form use a different vowel in the spoken form and even then the colloquial register uses spoken pronunciation exclusively.Marathi doesnt use nuqtas and has a native contrast between jz and jhzh. Plus the Devanagari diactritic used to represent an e sound can be pronounced as a schwa in certain contexts and this is actually a sound change and the spelling represents the Brahmin dialects pronunciation of the vowel in those contexts. To mark neuter plurals and also the singular nominative ending for neuter verb endingspronounsetc so its extremely important and common. Longshort vowel distinctions are represented in spelling but do not exist in the languages own phonology. Neither Tamil or Marathi ever primarily used the Perso Arabic script.Plus youre forgetting that for most of history and well up until after the British Raj the vast majority of South Asians were illiterate.And all this is without even taking into consideration languages like Mandarin or Cantonese where the scripts dont even indicate pronunciation.gt The name Umar has the schwa alreadyI meant the word for age. Its always pronounced with a schwa.gt This ironically leads to Pakistani Hindus having names spelt and pronounced like Parkash despite being able to pronounce the pr onset cluster perfectly in English words like practice.The pr cluster is IIRC loaned from Sanskrit. And Punjabis and some others dont use it. Hell Gurmukhi doesnt even use the halant the Indic diacritic for forming consonant clusters. You have many examples of simplified consonant clusters in Punjabi names like indar instead of indra etc. Theres Bhisham Sahni whose name is spelled Bhishma Sahni in Hindi and a bunch of other names where something similar occurs. The first name of Parkash Singh Badal a Punjabi CM shows the same phenomenon. I dont know Sindhi but its possible that its the same there. gt Only when I learnt Devanagari on my own and began reading Indian news and watching Indian TV did I encounter written forms with explicit vowels as bahin and sahib.I can confirm that the spelling bahan is by and large what youll see in most places including prose. Sahab is extremely common too for example the title of a Premchand short story uses sahab. Maybe your elders spoke a dialect where they used the i sound.gt the English script allows such variation with stressThe phonology of the English language. The script is merely a tool for representing speech. Hell island has an s that was artificially inserted and yet its never been pronounced.,linguistics,dgy55m2,2,t5_2qhos
11806146,0,t3_68c4nx,I cant help you with that but this is a similar problem when youre wanting to study languages in Siberia you better know Russian. And of course the other way around a huge amount of material is only available in English and not in any other language so researchers who dont know English are out of luck. Unless this material gets translated which requires significant work and not a lot of reward and so usually only the most important papers or books ever get translated the best thing to do is...to learn Italian to a sufficiently good reading knowledge. If youre going to work on Romance languages in Italy in situ it will be almost impossible without some knowledge of Standard Italian anyway. ,linguistics,dgy9mxy,3,t5_2qhos
