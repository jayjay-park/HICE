167815,0,t1_cexiw8s,Hello.  Thanks for the feedback! Keen eye on the clouds. I was lazy and used the same cloud models for each scene just rotated and scaled differently. The colored formations in the second are just abstracted trees more detail never hurts thanks..The depth of field effect was added in Photoshop using a luminance depth pass. All these were created in Maya and rendered with Mental Ray..I am doing more of these at the moment. Just finished a volcano one turned out pretty cool. Any ideas for more?,low_poly,cexjpv9,2,t5_2wn9u

247243,0,t1_cf6diwn,Yeah but even with the lowpoly theme the objective is to make it look somewhat realistic. In real life the aurora is much thinner taller and brighter. This looks more like a long clump with a displacer on it and the colors seem very dull. Try to look up pictures of the actual thing and work off that.,low_poly,cf6doqn,2,t5_2wn9u

3165695,0,t3_2wdqrt,For me low poly has always meant the minimum possible to express the object. Before baking textures and whatnot it had a very distinct look to it and ignoring hardware capabilities did the job. It was what we HAD to work with.Alot of whats been submitted Id say is more faceted than strictly low poly especially the pieces with terrain thats essentially quantize and jittered. I let it be as I dont want to discourage newbies and younglings from learning and getting to really rad capability.,low_poly,coq4g0f,3,t5_2wn9u

4543435,0,t3_3d2h90,I would really think hard about composition if I were you you have some really nice assets but they arent coming together as a really eye catching image. Think about how you want to lead the viewers eye through space. The trees are doing this a bit by having an opening in the foreground for us to look through them but I would push it even further. Landscapes are one of those things that can really come together with some solid leading lines as well as a dramatic sense of depth. With that said I would also push the distance between your foreground middle ground and background. Off to a very nice start though.,low_poly,ct3bs3v,1,t5_2wn9u

11001226,0,t1_de4d9gb,I think its a really lovely piece  Very impressive especially for your first scene. I agree with uszy  I think the Im guessing its a moon could do with having less polygons  it looks a bit too detailed IMO for an object that is so far away from the observer. Youve given the foreground rocks a lot more detail and definition than the larger ones further away and this works IMO because the closer an object is to someone the more detail they would expect to see  larger shapes can be a bit more abstracted than small ones. Even if Im misinterpreting the white sphere and its a floating object among the rocks I still would remove some of the detail as it seems a bit noisy compared to its surroundings in the scene.That said I think youve absolutely nailed it with the colours and choosing to use a portrait orientation over landscape which gives it a great sense of vertical scale my eyes are naturally drawn from the bottom of the image up to the moon ? as if Im stood on the surface and looking up. So yeah I would just say for next time  try to keep the size of your polys about the same across all the objects in your scene and itll feel a bit more cohesive ,low_poly,deeyg4w,2,t5_2wn9u
11034177,0,t1_deiom5k,Thanks and congrats! Well be continuing to develop it for many months so youll get to play with all the new content if you decide to pick it up later. No rush!,low_poly,deip69p,3,t5_2wn9u
11637663,0,t1_dgep89d,I will buy the SHIT out of this. It is too cute! If the gameplay has merit I think you guys have the potential to be super successful there is a huge hole in the market for beautiful games. ,low_poly,dgf54ls,5,t5_2wn9u
