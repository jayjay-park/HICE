4106940,0,t3_37amqu,I almost feel like I expected the statistical results that were given. I was mostly very slightly shocked by the number of unmarried generally younger women having children. In my opinion I think a woman should be financially stable and in a stable place even if that means not going through college. This does not mean Im not okay with unmarried having children Im just worried about the troubles that they may face when they are older and may not have a financial cushion the way I do because of my parents. I also worry about this happening to myself just because it could and I would not be ready for it and because I would be too afraid to abort the child because I would not be able to properly support it the way I would want to. In the trends that I think will continue their path I believe that more types or families will emerge and be accepted as well as the amount of parents who work of both genders and because family seems to be the more trusted according to the Pew Research families will have even more importance to more people. Our generation is seen as the most accepting of those who are different and are more willing to change because we see that the diversity will increase whether we want it to or not and the world is changing most would hope for the better. While there is a decline is marriages maybe its a good thing because people are thinking more about their future and trying to better it. I also feel that it seems that married couples with children tend to be more stable and may result in a better most likely less chaotic life than if they did not grow up in an unstable environment where for example the man in the mothers life frequently changes. I think that new generations of people spark different and newer trends in families. Newer generations have different ideas about everything and because they will be the future leaders of everything their opinions and views should at least be considered at first because it may be the way the future actually could be. ,VTHD2304Summer2015,croezwh,1,t5_386er
4168300,0,t3_382ojt,I enjoyed this racial and ethnic family topic because it really got me thinking about my own experiences with race. Both of my parents were born in Pakistan so I was raised in a Pakistani culture and environment. Although I was a different skin tone than everyone else at school I cannot remember a time I was picked on for that. However in high school my best friend whom I am no longer friends with would really get under my skin because she would constantly say awful things about my culture. I thought I could trust her when I needed to vent about how sometimes my parents would be strict with me. She took it a whole step further and say things she really had no clue about. She would say that my parents were horrible people. She would say us brown people were missing out because we cant eat things like pork and ham. She would say my family was basically stupid for not letting me wear shorts to school. She would also call the food that my mom makes gross. What she did not understand is that the only difference between my Pakistani family and her American family is that we had different customs and traditions we followed than she did. I really liked the Illusion of Race video because it really sends the point home that race has nothing to do with genetics. I also really liked the Jay Smooth video discussing how to approach the topic of race with someone else. Its kind of cool to see how he talked about it because I believe I made a mistake when I first approached my friend about her comments about my race. At the end of our senior year in high school things kind of blew up and we ended up having a huge fight and I ended up telling her that she was a mean and insensitive person. We stopped talking for a few days to cool down. When I later talked to her I was able to keep calm and tell her exactly what she said that hurt my feelings. When I talked to her about what she did rather than what she was we ended up having a much better conversation. She finally realized why I was so upset and never made comments about my race again. ,VTHD2304Summer2015,crve7fe,1,t5_386er
4239865,0,t3_390vsi,I truly believe that there is someone on earth for everyone. The reason I believe this is because yes we are all different but someone has to be somewhat similar to your liking. The video On dating says that there is not someone out there for everyone. I disagree with him. People who live their entire lives single do so just because they havent found the right person not because they dont exist. I you can make the statement Theres no one on earth for me you have not tried.  I actually have the app Tinder which was shown in the cartoon like video. I personally swipe through everyone just as the male and female in the clip. Tinder isnt exactly the ideal way of meeting your girlfriend or future wife but its possible. Tinder is usually just for a hookup for a night or so. in the What is Love video there are several definitions of the word LOVE. I agree with some of the definitions they provided such as public affection kissing and a magical emotion. The word love can have a different definition from each person on earth. There should not be a specific definition of love because everyone loves differently therefore having their own way of describing their feelings. Dating now days we consider dating Talking. Talking is the step before actually being in a relationship with someone. Basically when you want to have ties but not have ties at the same time. We consider people to be Talking when neither party claim each other but they have somewhat of a relationship together. Talking can lead to a relationship or it can lead to a solid friendship. what is love video stated how love definitions come from past experiences. If this is true what if you have not experienced love how would you know if your loving someone or in love? I disagree with this statement. Love is just a feeling you get for someone or something thats indescribable. It can be after having loved before or it can be without loving before. ,VTHD2304Summer2015,cs3jbno,1,t5_386er
