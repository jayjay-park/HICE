4531412,0,t1_ct1hs6q,Thats something that I really havent worked out yet... Is pricing... Youre right its niche and I am still trying to figure out when is the best time to start charging. We have some users.. Not a lot and I am afraid if I start to charge too soon I might drive a lot of them away. We are thinking about property management as a more generalized field.,roastmystartup,ct1tim3,1,t5_393bi
4607347,0,t3_3e2yj9,Firstly I gotta say bravo! Its a ballsy move to bank on VR in its current state. High risk potentially high reward.Before I even talk about your project though I feel like I should say a few words about VR.Depending on which game blog youre reading VR is either dead in the water or the second coming of video gamejesus. I tend to lean towards the former for several reasons Beyond the initial excitement of HOLY SHIT I CAN LOOK AROUND a lot of complaints have been surfacing. There are no standardized controls yet. Nausea and headaches are common. Issues that can be easily ignored in a standard gaming environment camera glitches textureobject popin etc. are incredibly immersionbreaking on VR headsets.  Pricing is incredibly prohibitive. The Oculus Rift will cost as much as a standalone console. This may not be a problem for some masterrace gamers that spend  on their rigs but will be a problem for everyone else.  Like the EyeToy and Kinect VR headsets run the risk of being perceived as gimmicky. Even with killerapps segmenting the gamer base may discourage developers from making bigbudget titles for VR which in turn would discourage core gamers from purchasing the hardware which in turn would discourage developers from making games... Headsets WILL be perceived as gimmicky without new and intuitive forms of controls. Freely looking around will lose its coolnessfactor if youre still using a DualShock  or a mouse and keyboard to traverse the games.  New and intuitive forms of controls will also be prohibitively expensive and will also segment the market further.Now if even if VR fails to reach the massmarket you can still sell a few copies of your gamesif you target your products effectively. This means having a deep understanding of the consumers that are buying into VR. You clearly dont.Developing JRPG for VR is fucking ridiculous. Most people that are interested in this genre are playing on handheld and consoles. Theyre not going to spend  on a VR headset just so they can play your little indie game with an alternate perspective. The people that ARE investing into VR are buying into immersive firstperson experiences. Just look at the mist downloaded demos for Oculus. People who own VR headsets are also not using them to game seriously. They use them as showpieces. They load their harddrives with  minute demos and only bust the headsets out when they have guests. Look at how coolprettyimmersive this is! Considering the quality of your first project I sincerely doubt your next game will appeal to this crowd.Its not all bad news though. Gimmicky sports games might sell. From what I have seen no one has developed a notable Wii Sports for VR yet Also understanding how the tech works and how to develop it may allow you to pivot into more profitable directions e.g. developing the software for VR porn. As long as you are attentive enough to the markets needs build a name for yourself as a competent VR studio and stay afloat long enough you may have some profitable opportunities in the future. ,roastmystartup,ctbc97v,1,t5_393bi

4814385,0,t3_3gsw5q,gtI would like to create a website where locals can advertise tours or experiences such as brewery tours bike tour of a city historymonument tour food tour hikes etc.A directory? Thats swell. gt Aside from Vayable there is minimal competition.ToursByLocalsShowAroundHomedine and EatwithTripbodTripr app  reads like the intro to a Taken movie franchise rebootYeah. No competition. None. Tons of press coverage for each yet they must not get any business. gtI cant get myself pull the trigger due to the many complications I foresee such as legal issues and whether or not the product is something consumers would be interested in.I think its safe to say the category is of interest. That is not to say your particular execution within that category is going to get much traction. How and what you offer is a major unknown variable. A site can have every feature you list and flop due to flawed or no user testing. This isnt a new idea. The only reason for few large competitors is there was a shakeout. Its a dubious assumption to make youre staking out any new territory. When any entrepreneur starts talking about that new thing called the internet and how its going to be big I have to roll my eyes. Not that Im disagreeing just that all the new stuff is really old stuff.  Id pretend all these other sites are generating business and take a look at some new research. With an eye to finding out what these sites should offer but dont. Dont brush off bad reviews of Vayable figure out how a group of random unscreened locals isnt going to produce the exact same thing for your company. Research gripes ... then you address them effectively with your offering. The lets just google and copy everything everyone else is doing thing wears thin. And I would be surprised if Vayable didnt offer ratings of its tour operators. So if youre relying on that in a country where holding tourists for ransom is a national past time Id rethink the authentic experience thing in outoftheway secluded places where nobody can hear your screams. Luckily that only happens in countries nobody ever heard of like Mexico Im relying on the American education system for that however.

6672971,0,t1_d09600c,It could be. I usually stay in hostels and when  I go someplace I usually already have an activity in mind.  I dont really have an alternative but maybe I can give detail on my problems. I dont know to pronounce it.  Spotee? Spotty? Its supposed to evoke what? Like a cool local spot? Its short but doesnt stick out enough. And too reminiscent of Spotify. Really needs to evoke its own image you know? ,roastmystartup,d09jk06,1,t5_393bi
6874703,0,t1_d0ucdbp,I kind of envisioned a single panel ad much shorter than your whole page with a description of the package a picture and an itemized list.  The price would be prominently displayed somewhere in it.I dont know anything about advertising it elsewhere. I meant advertise as in how you describe it on your own page.  As far as the prices go you could just go to another web sites that sell those goods at retail prices and add up the price of buying them all separately.  If it is less than what you are selling it for make note of it.  Save XX! A XX value!,roastmystartup,d0vk761,1,t5_393bi
