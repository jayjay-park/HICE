5942580,0,t3_3wrcdv,This game looks like last years MyNBA game and that one had a  card limit as well. In order for them to up the limit to  they had to restructure a lot of the my cards menus and other behind the scenes things to increase the limit. I know the  card limit is a technical limitation of the current build of the game. I assume once this game gets some legs they will implement the current gen software the other apps use,NHLSuperCard,cxylorc,3,t5_3a8yr

7697461,0,t3_4jbp7t,take your  weakest positions and swap out all  of those players in each position for commons. The  tier will always match what your current tier is. So if you drop down to Epic thats what the  matchup will be even if you are playing for a Star Wayne Simmonds.Then wait for a  player matchup to come and play both your common cards. Ideally you lose  matches per game.,NHLSuperCard,d3h5gds,1,t5_3a8yr
