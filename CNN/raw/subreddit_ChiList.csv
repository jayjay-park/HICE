10897920,0,t3_5ujcc8,I dont been this in a mean way but theres no way your GPU is worth   they sell on eBay for about th that price. Overall your prices seem a little inflated have you searched through rhardwareswap ? Even your CPU is worth about  so I cant imagine the total value is worth more than  overall. Again Im not being mean but this would have been a midtier build in  and I wouldnt want anyone here to get a bad deal. You can build a computer with new parts for  that will be much better.,ChiList,de41k9m,2,t5_2s7zl
