5043982,0,t3_3k0m1g,If youre in NC the Hayes School of Music at Appalachian State University is an amazing school with low tuition. Our music education program is second to none in the eastern part of the U.S. Excluding conservatories and schools like JuliardThe small population and location of the campus in the mountains make it like a vacation every time I go back to school. Even if its out of state for you it would be worth a shot to look into the school. Its in Boone NC. ,MajoringInMusic,cutzp0p,2,t5_39rtg
