Try getting the Anaconda distribution  it has all the tools you will ever need and is completely free.I still have high hopes from Julia but the noises coming from that sector are not always very encouraging.,materials,crzpvpu,4,t5_2qnph
5011158,0,t3_3jkgi2,Hmm only thing Im familiar with are the kinds of expanding foam you get at Home Depot that takes forever to solidify... You might look at metallic foams if the heat isnt an issue. Or if you dont really need foam but just a material that sets instantly you could look at ultraviolet setting epoxy.For that matter I wonder if theres an ultravioletset epoxyfoam like the stuff dentists use to fix teeth. Thats not a foam but it does set in seconds under UV light. If you could foam that and introduce a strong UV source youd get what youre looking for.In the marineboat world they have UVsetting epoxies that you might be able to foam and try. Doesnt really expand though. Expansion is a function of gaseous release and that needs a certain chemistry.But you know most expoxies will foam and expand on their own if put into a vacuum chamber... if you could force air into the expoxy at high pressure then release the pressure later you could get a foam at regular pressure that expands.,materials,cuq18pi,3,t5_2qnph
6715980,0,t3_47kcrc,Penn State has a great MATSE program and plenty of ceramics related research A list of our departments faculty Im currently a doctoral candidate at Penn State and I also did my undergrad here. PM if you have any questions about our program or any of the people in our department.Also ceramics is kind of big field and kind of a blanket statement these days  Anything in particular you are interested in?  We have world renown researchers here like Susan TrolierMcKinstry Venkat Gopalan Gary Messing and Clive Randall.  All do lots of ceramic processing all different applications. But the biggest question you need to answer for yourself is what are you interested in doing at the end of the day?,materials,d0dznz8,1,t5_2qnph

7501862,0,t3_4gay28,Hi! Super late reply but I hope I can still offer my own experience. Im sure you have submitted your application by now but I just want to share with you how Im doing in my course too. Currently an undergrad student in third year of uni and I still have a year two go before I get to start on my thesis. I see a lot of people taking chemistry or applied physics before pursuing graduate level MSE but I chose to just start with materials engineering so that Im already at the core of the course.I came from a science high school so at our senior year there were local collegesuniversities that came by and presented and materials engineering was one of those which caught my eye. I looked into it a bit and decided that I could give it a shot seeing as its an interesting field with many possible applications and specializations. Its a field thats very general because we are literally living in a material world.My first two years in university was spent on fulfilling prerequisite units. That includes  units of math  units of chem  units of physics  more units on engineering sciences. I think its the hardest part trudging through all those general subjects without yet seeing their relevance to the major itself  but getting to actually have subjects focused on materials engineering you get to appreciate how it all comes together.Our department has multiple labs with ongoing researches and they have open apprenticeships to students who want to learn how to use equipment who want to help in special funded projects etcetera. Its one way of keeping the students in our department interested and seeing how materials engineering have actual real life applications outside of the theory being taught in classrooms. Im not working in a laboratory right now but I have one subject kinetics laboratory where I use one of the labs for my personal research which is a requirement like a final project to be presented in a conference and seeing the work being done for a funded project and being mentored by one of the professors from consultations really solidifies my interest in the field.There are a lot of fields you can go to specialize in nanotechnology biomaterials plasma materials smart materials alloys just to name a few. Im sure youll be able to find at least one youre interested in while learning. It helps if you already have a drive or a goal beforehand e.g. you want to build an awesome spaceship or you want to be able to recycle plastics. Hope you find materials engineering to be a good choice! ,materials,d2ux820,1,t5_2qnph

9772408,0,t3_5f5j6b,Annealing occurs in  stages.  First any strain fields such as those around a dislocation drive diffusion in such a way to minimize the strain fields.  If you stop annealing after this stage you will see that the grain boundaries are the same as before but there are very few dislocations in the material.Second new stress free grains begin to form.  I am not sure exactly where these new grains nucleate but they are in different locations and orientations to the original grains.Lastly these new grains grow and the overall grain structure becomes more coarse.These processes happen in this order because of the temperature required to activate them.  Strain fields can be reduced by diffusion at a lower temperature than the other two processes so they always happen first.  This means that they do not become grain boundaries later into the annealing process.It is helpful to think of annealing as a reset switch for the microstructure.  So long as you anneal at a standardized temperature through all  stages you will always get the same microstructure no matter what the history of the alloy was so long as there were no chemical changes.  This is why it is very common to test the properties of annealed material in scientific literature.  The only way for cold rolling to impact the grains after annealing is if you did not anneal for long enough.  For example if you stop after the stress reduction stage you will still see the elongated grains that result from rolling.,materials,dahnz00,10,t5_2qnph

As long as you have the set up for slip casting you should be able to create a slip casting from limestone slurry. I expect that the finer your dust the more successful you will be.,materials,ddjgjyc,1,t5_2qnph
