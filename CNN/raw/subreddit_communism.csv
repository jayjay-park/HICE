5599,0,t1_ceeurff,gtCom. Morales I understand that you are very upset that someone on the Internet doesnt agree with your policies and your vision of socialism  Save your shitty condescending babble. gtaknowledges the achievements of Bolivia under MoralesWhere is that? Unless you count as achievements winning elections and enacting conservative policies.  gtand at the same time Petras has to conclude that Bolivia under Morales doesnt really move to socialism  Yes I read that and called it crap and I will still say it is crap.  gtthey still remain an exploited class while the country is reigned by the same old oligarchy.Short sighted crap. Because we live in a bourgeois society for the last two centuries does that mean that the plight of the poor didnt change that much in these two centuries? Is the struggle still fundamentally the same fought in the same way more or less on the same level? There is no dynamic in the class struggle? Nevermind that broadly speaking large sectors of the previously very comfortable ruling class in Bolivia is increasingly worried and no doubt plotting coups against Morales as is traditional in the continent. That shouldnt tell you anything.  You know where the criticism Petras is making is coming from. It doesnt even take any observation of the real world to prevent the kneejerk repetition of theory that reformism doesnt work to change the mode of production. He hardly has to know what is happening in Bolivia to say that and you dont even have to make an effort to accept it. It is something I agree with.  The way he does it however is dishonest and cheap. It ignores what the previously disenfranchised bolivian poor and workers have been witnessing in their lives currently in order to make an absurd theoretical point. The point that Bolivia is the most reactionary regime in a continent that was historically infested with fascism.  It is ridiculous and you think he has a point. I dont know why I am talking to you and I should never talk to you again because you are beyond repair.  ,communism,cef2oot,2,t5_2qolz

Similarly my understanding of class is partially influenced by EP Thompson as much as it is influenced by Althusser and you cant get more opposed than that!  Yes they are diametrically opposed but not so much on some areas.  On the whole I side more with the way Althusser thinks of dialectics but this does not mean that I also do not like some of the problematics Ilyenkov examined.I probably should have just left my original critique at the basic level of my problem with its understanding of the sciences rather than open the proverbial can of worms about dialectics in general.

1898150,0,t3_2gctsv,edit this is a pretty disjointed post I wrote it in the middle of other bits and pieces Im concerning myself with right now hopefully theres a semblance of sense in it!edit  and as always call me out if Im talking shitI think this is a much better article on Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea What Went Wrong With The Pol Pot Regime Its tossed around a lot but thats because its really good  materialist and very in depth.I dont think the article posted here I think its from the Progressive Labor Party periodical but Im only taking an educated guess is very good. I have not taken a deep study of PLs line at all but glancing at Wikipedia it appears that they held a deeply antinationalist line  this shows early on where the author talks about the threeway split of the Indochina Communist Party. Being a Marxist and an antiimperialist I think that the nationalism of oppressed nations under the correct leadership of an antirevisionist revolutionary Communist Party can be progressive  we need only to look at China where the establishment of a Chinese peoples republic after a struggle against imperialist nationalism saw the road to socialism open up and the wellbeing of the people increase considerably.Like Voidkom noted this article has baseless attacks on the peasantry as a class. The article says In Russia Lenins earliest polemic  was directed against the Narodniki or Friends of the People. The pettybourgeois Narodniki too preached a peasant communalism in words but practiced bloody terrorism. Drawing from this that Leninism is basically against the peasantry is absurd  Lenin understood that the peasantry was a reactionary class but that its reaction was different to bourgeois reaction. In Russia allying with the peasantry was a necessity because the proletariat was comparatively miniscule the same is the case in all underdeveloped countries under imperialist capitalism.The PL was known for its rejection of New Democracy not on the basis of its inapplicability given certain conditions not present in the US that were present in China which is completely valid but because it was apparently a revisionist nationalist theory. It was not necessarily a nationalist theory  though the Chinese Revolution was in some ways nationalist being that the tasks of the Communist Party in an underdeveloped country include the nationaldemocratic revolution or according to Mao a New Democratic revolution the New Democratic revolution was a revolution that placed China on the socialist road. It was certainly not a revisionist theory  it is compatible with the theory and principles of Marxism and Leninism.Further its extremely strange how this article claims that CPK was antiCommunist but that emptying the cities was necessary  it was not necessarily at all a party with decent leadership would have been able to account for the growing populations of the cities. That really reads like the author trying to distance their tendency from CPK and rebuke antiCommunists at the same time which is possible to do but done very poorly here. Im also not sure why the author keeps referring to capitalist researchers  saying even capitalists think x! doesnt strengthen their case its actually extremely bad. Likewise the fact that US imperialism killed more Cambodians than the Khmer Rouge is important because it highlights how brutal US imperialism is but I dont understand why it discussed here in the way that it is.Theres also the number of quotes at the end. Since theres no analysis of the texts themselves and given the way that the author has discussed the history of Cambodia under Khmer Rouge here this looks like the author is opportunistically cherrypicking quotes. This is extremely patronising to the readership  the authors dishonesty is transparent to me I dont believe for a second that these capitalist texts portray Khmer Rouge as antiCommunists. Further statements like were not Communists were revolutionaries were likely rhetorical and without context putting them forward as actual statements of fact is essentially lying to us.Finally theres that little stab at anarchism at the end. None of us are anarchists but there was no analysis whatsoever concerning how the Khmer Rouges programme was anarchist. That was a baseless insult and unbecoming of Communists.I do not defend the Pol Pot regime Democratic Kampuchea or the CPK. I dont deny that they were Communist though I believe that the line they held was devastatingly incorrect and that it resulted in the deaths of many and the failure to establish socialism in that country.,communism,ckhx0nl,13,t5_2qolz

1987413,0,t1_cksn4m5,I think this just misses the point entirely. Nobody is arguing that the current global configuration is eternal and unchangeable. Of course it can change and is changing. The right conditions that would make the vast majority of the imperialist working class lose access to the surplus value extracted from the periphery would be pretty dramatic but they are not impossible. Something like that is actually happening to some extent in some weak imperialist countries because of the last crisis.This is all irrelevant though and arguing very strongly for that kind of obvious notion but everything changes! is weird. The point here is that as it currently exists imperialism creates a kind of world split in the working class that makes revolutions in the imperialist centers pretty unlikely. This is not some kind of radical notion put forward by MTWists it was already acknowledged a century ago! by Lenin himself and in its general form it is pretty standard Leninist doctrine revolution in the weakest links first and all that. The fact that there has been exactly zero successful revolutions in the imperialist countries since then and many elsewhere seems to give validity to his observation.All this does not mean that revolution is impossible in the First World or that the whole situation cannot change. In fact laws only exist as tendencies in Marxism so speaking of absolute impossibilities is generally nonsensical. It just means that concrete reality as it currently exists imposes on us some limitations that are pretty hard to ignore.,communism,cksomrp,3,t5_2qolz

2711788,0,t3_2r49yl,What is interesting about Sikder today is that I think his ideas and tactics could be applicable to Ukrainian conflict if there was a revolutionary communist party in Ukraine which is lacking. Sikder argued that East Pakistan now Bangladesh was a colony of Pakistan. Indeed there was little common between two parts of the then Pakistan and the same one could say about Western and Eastern Ukraine  they are two different countries. But when Indian army invaded East Pakistan during IndoPakistani war Sikder argued that India wants to turn East Pakistan into its colony and the communists should now fight Indian expansionism and the Bengali nationalists  the Awami League.gtThat history repeated in changed situation of . In greed for power representative of reactionary bureaucratic bourgeoisie intellectuals and feudalists the Awami League and Moni SinghMozaffar traitor clique being failed to liberate East Bengal depending on their own strength betrayed with the national interest of seventy five million people sold East Bengal to Indian expansionism by suppressing the dignity of Bengali nation under their feet and invited them Indian expansionists to overthrow the Pak military fascists.gtThe Indian expansionists took that opportunity with the help and support of Soviet social imperialism. In order to capture East Bengal they formed Bangladesh puppet government and established it as their stooge formed their lackey liberation force under the control of their army to use it as the food for their artillery and sent them to East Bengal to carry sabotage activities. At last they attacked Pakistan captured East Bengal by their armed aggressor force and established puppet government by the Awami League betrayers.gtThus East Bengal became a colony of India and East Bengal people got chained in subservience of Indian expansionism.

DOTP often turns into a mess not due to socialism itself but the conditions that plagued socialism. Look at the problems under the Stalin and Mao regimes they all were due to coming out of feudalism. Now thats not to say a nation must wait for capitalism to develop but that it will be harder and will likely be messier. If America went socialist the state could wither away more easily.

The decision to take the government down was made quickly and lots of people adopted a wait and see attitude then coming over the Bolsheviks conclusively after Kerensky started firing on neutrals. Whats ignored is that the revolution was process that started in February when workers set up soviets in response to the power vacuum. This created a situation of dual power where the working class organizations in the cities and army held most of the real day to day power but the parliamentary government said it was in control. After the Bolsheviks were elected to the majority in the soviets and military revolutionary committees they had the mandate to rule in their eyes. All they had to do was push out the already collapsing bourgeois state which they did. The reason you cant say it was some small elitist pitch is because these working class organizations existed and were central to the new workers state.Also worth taking into consideration is that few people learn about the coup of General Kornilov shortly before the revolution. He tried to overthrow the parliamentary state and install a military dictatorship. The only reason the government was saved was because the Bolsheviks and the red guard came to their rescue. ,communism,cp26h7j,2,t5_2qolz

I dont know exactly what would happen if the authorization stopped but the HelmsBurton act etc. were still in force.My parents lived in Shanghai in  so this is just hearsay. But my understanding is that at least in Shanghai the early stages of liberalization involved individuals or families selling homemade food or crafts which had previously been illegal. According to what Ive heard from friends who visited Cuba recently something similar is happening there now where for the first time people are allowed to sell food or rent out rooms in their houses. Add in residential real estate sales and this could lead to private accumulation of significant capital.I obviously dont know how to run an economy better than the people who have training experience and a personal stake in the wellbeing of their country. I still have opinions and I still enjoy having discussions. But in case that question wasnt entirely rhetorical I dont think improving production and output are worth the potential IMO serious risk of creeping capitalism.

4102837,0,t1_crnv0z3,gt Youre applying a label that was completely meaningless in the context of the time.It seems you have a reading comprehension problem. I never labelled Raskolnikov anything. I said his statement that he waged an ideological struggle against all the oppositions both in the press and in broad meetings is a lie which it clearly is.Nor was this label meaningless. It had a very clear meaning. Lenin had been using the term as early as gtEveryone is saying havent I the right to know who I am working for whom I am helping to get elected to the Duma? Maybe its a liquidator? Maybe its some muddled Trotskyist conciliator? Perhaps I am taking part indirectly in drawing up a common platform??gtThe revolutionary SocialDemocrats have given their answer to these questions which are more interesting and important than the philistineTrotskyist attitude of uncertainty will there be a revolution or not who can tell?gtThose however who preach to the masses their vulgar intellectualist. BundistTrotskyist scepticismwe dont know whether there will be a revolution or not but the current issue is reformsare already corrupting the masses preaching liberal utopias to them. gtThe August blocas we said at the time in August turned out to be a mere screen for the liquidators. That bloc has fallen asunder. Even its friends in Russia have not been able to stick together. The famous uniters even failed to unite themselves and we got two August trends the Luchist trend Nasha Zarya and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta and the Trotskyist trend Borba. Both are waring scraps of the general and united August banner which they have torn up and both are shouting themselves hoarse with cries of unity! gtA good lesson for those who succumbing to the idle chatter of the liberals of the Bund and the Trotskys from Vienna are still capable of believing in unitywith the liquidators. The vaunted Organising Commission of Lieber Trotsky and the liquidators cried out from the housetops about unity but in fact it could not and did not supply a single slogan actually uniting the revolutionary struggle of the workers. The liquidators supplied their own nonrevolutionary slogans slogans of a liberal labour policy but the movement disregarded them. That is what lies at the bottom of the Trotskyist fables about unity! gtThe Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee unanimously condemned liquidationism as we have pointed out above. But one section of the most important resolution known as its Clause  was formulated in such a way as to have the directly opposite meaning it played into the hands of the liquidators. This clause expressed the opinion that at present i.e. at a time of counterrevolution the SocialDemocrats were for the first time making full use of the methods of the international SocialDemocracy. This clause which left a loophole for renegade theories was proposed by Tyszka who tried to manoeuvre between the liquidators and the Party. It is only natural that the liquidators should have enthusiastically supported the clause helping Tyszka to victory some of the Bolsheviksthe socalled group of conciliators i.e. virtual Trotskyistsalso went over to the side of the liquidators.

In a socialist country they are more powerful and the state is more likely to listen to them so they become massively organised pressure groups.

However Trotsky rejected that description of the USSR claiming instead that it was a degenerated workers state. After World War II most Trotskyists accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being deformed workers states. However alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a New Class theory to explain what they regard as the essentially nonsocialist nature of the USSR Cuba China and other selfproclaimed socialist states.I dont pretend to know what sect one belongs to. Either way his deformed worker state analysis could very well be copy and pasted onto Cuba but it isnt  potentially because of very political reasons.

5042314,0,t3_3jzkee,Organize organize organize.  I have seen and been a part of so many organizations that seem to focus way too much time on planning actions and not nearly enough on actually building a movement.  Always remember that because you will not win overnight the primary goal must be to build a movement that can sustain itself through multiple setbacks and still remain strong enough to eventually win its demands.  As a secondary goal once you have built a movement which is a threat to the system which it will necessarily be if it wins any victories you dont want to let it fall apart once your primary objective of a wage increase is met because a there will always be a backlash against workers victories and b if you can win one victory thats means you can win more and there is always more that we are fighting for.There are a lot of ways to keep your work centered around this principle and maybe other comrades can share their strategies for organization building and maintenance but there are two major ways that I have found most useful in my political work which like yours is centered on raising wages but on a much smaller scale so youll need to tweak them a little to fit a national campaign.The first is to always look at the big picture.  In one group that I was a part of we would have a strategy meeting twice a year to plan for the next six months.  We would draw a big diagonal line pointing upward on a sheet of paper put a dot at the bottom left and say We are here.  Then wed put a dot at the top right and say This is where well be in sixth months and we would figure out what that looked like.  Since youre a new organization that might look like In sixth months well have a small yet strong dedicated core membership.  Well have mailing list of names phone numbers and addresses that we can organize around.  Well have one large action under our belt say a large rally.  Then we would work out the answer to the question How do we get from Point A to Point B?  If we want a dedicated core we need to have regular meetings that are wellrun an easy way for everyone to communicate a phone tree a message board and a Bring everyone you know attitude so that we can draw as many people in as we can and foster leadership in anyone who shows dedication.  If we want a mailing list we will have to have collect names so well hit up all the community events that we can and talk to any and everyone about the campaign.  At our own events and meetings well be sure to get information on every new person.  If we want to have a large rally we need to have smaller events to build awareness standing with Honk for higher wages signs writing editorials in local left papers and letters to the editors in all the big papers delivering a letter that demands higher wages signed by a few community leaders to some kind of government rep for examples pick speakers and help them in any way they need pass out flyers everywhere we can and converse with everyone who takes one have a big signpainting party to get ready and call everyone on our mailing list the night before to invite them to come. And once we knew all the things we needed to do we plotted them on the timeline in order We will start our mailing list next week.  We will start our newsletter in October. We will have small actions in November and December. We deliver our letter in January.  We will begin planning the rally in February.  We will hold a large rally with at least  people in March.  And then at the end of the six months wed get together and write a list of what went well and what we could have done differently or needs to change.  Then wed make a new six month plan We will have a small but broad coalition of local groups involved in the campaign by June.  We will do another large action say a sitin in August.  Having an escalation plan like this ensures that you are always moving forward with concrete steps on the path to your goal and it makes all the difference between building a powerful movement that can win or floundering in an ineffective organization until everyone gets burn out by the lack of progress and quits.The second thing to focus on is building power.  You do this first by being superorganized.  Every meeting should have an agenda even when you are a tiny group of three people.  Never just show up and say What do we need to talk about?  Set a time limit for each item on the agenda proportional to its importance or complexity and stick to it.  The best way to do this is to always have a facilitator who is keeping track of time.  After about an hour to . hours peoples brains are just gonna turn off and you wont succeed at doing anything except boring the hell out of potential members.Eventually your movement will have three categories of members  the dedicated core who are at every meeting  the broader membership that you can count on to show up at every rally and maybe do a few organizing tasks on the side and  the folks who will come out to rallies but only after you convince them.  At this point you probably want to have two separate regular meetings one for the core who will deal with the hard work working on strategy and national coordination and one for the general membership who will deal with the fun work planning actions and training.  But even though you are having separate meetings always focus on turning the s into s and the s into s  that is invite everyone at the rally to a general meeting and encourage the folks who have attended a few general meetings to come to the core meetings.  And once they show up always give them work to do from something simple like Talk to your friend Mary about coming out to the next rally to something larger like Wanna speak at our next rally?  Giving people responsibility within the movement is the best way to build power and foster leadership and something as simple as asking someone whos sort of new to facilitate the next meeting could be a transformative moment for someone whos never thought of themself as an activist.Reading groups starting with Lets talk about this really interesting article on civil disobediance and working up to Lets read Lenin activist training Were doing a sitin in two months so lets roleplay how itll probably go down and mentoringstyle relationships where core members take on responsibility for organizing and training new members are other good ways to build power.  Transformative is really a key word  the job of your organization is to transform people from all walks of life into politicallyempowered movement leaders.  Always focus on this in everything that you do and then even if your campaign fails the movement will still have struck a large blow against capitalism by raising the political consciousness of your community and the willingness of people to confront the state.And always keep an eye towards security.  Once you represent a legitimate threat to the status quo they will certainly fight back.  Information about movement business should be on a needtoknow basis and everyone from the core leadership to the folks who just show up to rallies from time to time should have some kind of understanding of security culture.Important edit I want to add celebrate all your victories! All of them even small things like gaining momentum on facebook or getting a letter printed in the paper or forcing a local politician to officially respond to an action.  The fight will most likely not be easy and celebrating every single victory is important for preventing burnout in established members as well as impressing potential members with how bad ass your organization is.,communism,cutsg3b,17,t5_2qolz

Indeed the majority of the working class and indigenous people already engage in a passive boycott effectively doing nothing. This is why we are explicit in calling for an active boycott that is to say a boycott which is not the end of a persons political activity but the beginning of political engagement with the revolutionary movement in Canada. We are not simply calling for people to do nothing but rather to organize themselves around revolutionary progressive and democratic political organizations to continue their political activity after the elections are over. The boycott is a call to organize not a call for inaction.Ironically we would hazard that many of the people who work on the boycott campaign are far more politically active around the elections than many of those that support the bourgeois political parties and deride the boycott.In turn we flip this on its head given how ineffective voting is if anything to vote is to do nothing and change nothing. To boycott is to break ideologically with bourgeois democracy no small feat!,communism,cv3r30u,5,t5_2qolz

5373024,0,t1_cvyfaq8,Indeed though its a common problem with the left as a whole.

Sure the state does infiltrate movements directly but it also does not have to act like a god or is it a god since bourgeois ideas even repellant ones like white nationalism are a fact of life under capitalism.The irony with this attitude is that it was a hallmark of the socalled Stalinism that anarchists despise at least IMO as a Maoist who agrees with the assessment that the CPSU under Stalin failed to make a distinction between contradictions amongst the people and contradictions between the people and the enemy though at least Stalin had the excuse of actually living in a state that was under siege and no previous existing modern socialist states to learn from.,communism,cvygq4e,5,t5_2qolz

And so without forgetting the conditional and relative value of all definitions in general which can never embrace all the concatenations of a phenomenon in its full development we must give a definition of imperialism that will include the following five of its basic featuresgt  the concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic lifegt  the merging of bank capital with industrial capital and the creation on the basis of this finance capital of a financial oligarchygt  the export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires exceptional importancegt  the formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the world among themselves and gt  the territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed. Imperialism is capitalism at that stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.

Their cooperation with some minor groups stands in stark contrast with their lifeanddeath battle against AlNusra which many more FSA groups openly cooperate with. Then you count the local coordinating committees of Syria which is a heavily U.S. funded opposition group like most of the opposition is in exile and its interesting to note where exactly they are based Qatar Jordan Turkey and of course the U.S. In any case they are a network of activists whose primary importance in the Syrian conflict is in passing on information to Western media. They have no boots on the ground. Apart from that information about what exactly they are coordinating is very scarse. What are they actually doing in the areas where they supposed to be active? Setting up workers cooperatives? Organizing to protect minority rights? Giving free education to the people? Perhaps they are organizing free courses on gender equality and liberation? Yeah I think not. While the accomplishments of the Kurdish movement have been widely publicized and verified and even ISIS is quick to boast about the supposed social programs they have implemented  there seems to be a mysterious silence about all of the socalled activism these socalled activists are supposed to be undertaking.Then there is the revolutionary left current which all the proimperialist trotskyists got a raging hardon over despite the fact that they are literally utterly irrelevant. Can anyone even tell me exactly where this revolutionary left current is based what neighbourhoods they control? Despite having heard the name of this socalled group hundreds of times in defenses by the proimperialist left Ive literally never heard of single accomplishment this group achieved or even attempted. None. Have they even organized anything anywhere ever? Frankly I doubt they even exist other than perhaps a small group putting out messages on the internet. That leaves us with various militias secularists and various FSA in other words nothing. You dont have a clue which groups exactly these various groups are supposed to be where these various groups operate what these various groups actually do what allies these various groups have. Critical thought disappears under the comfy blanket of just knowing deep in your heart that Assad is a tyrant like Stalin and that youve heard these people are fighting for a political revolution that will bring enlightened bourgeois democracy free elections and the advancement of worldsocialism to Syria.

Since I took the time to respond I might as well comment a bit more extensively on why this article is shit gtInstead Russias military might is directed at Syrias resistance militias and civilians living in liberated zones which have become death camps under the states scorched earth tactics and crippling blockades.Here the author uses the same strategy you do deliberately being opaque about who exactly is being targeted. The author ignores that according to literally all accounts before the Russian bombing started it is mostly AlNusra and affiliated jihadist militias which are in control of the areas currently targeted by Russia. Oh and CIAtrained militias of course but this is not a concern for the author and doesnt diminish their status as the Syrian resistance. It is almost as if the author doesnt really care about U.S. imperialism. I wonder why.  gtThe resistance continues to make gains and liberate towns around Hama even under Russian bombs dealing a heavy blow to the states demoralized troops.The gains by the resistance around Hama was actually a twopronged attack by  an alliance of rebel groups led by AlNusra called Ansar alSharia  the Fateh Halab alliance which includes the Islamic Front and a couple of other jihadist groups as well as some socalled moderate groups  ISIS. This is what the author calls the resistance.gtThere is less cause for optimism in southern Aleppo where the regime has made significant gains with its massive reliance on foreign Shia militias from Iran Iraq and Lebanon on the ground backed by Russia in the sky. But as Assads Syrian Arab Army is increasingly fragmenting and looks too weak to regain and hold lost territory the resistance looks more unified than it has for a long time.Aside from the clearly racist implications of the scare quotes around the word arab in SAA shiites arent arabs? By the way in case you didnt know the majority of the SAA is sunni the increased unification this author is referring to is a unification between the socalled moderates and openly reactionary jihadist groups. Even ISIS is being included since AlNusra by all accounts one of the largest and most important rebel groups in the FSA is now searching for a way to reconcile with them. Clearly a great advance for the cause of liberation.Oh and of course the author makes some mindless and unsubstantiated accusations against their opponents of orientalism that goes without saying. The fact that millions went to vote in the elections called by the government despite foreign governments doing everything they could to prevent people from voting see the pictures of endless masses queuing up in Lebanon is ignored. The fact acknowledged even by Assads greatest enemies that the government still retains significant support among large sectors of the population and especially minorities what ever happened to socalled anarchists caring about minority rights? is ignored. These Syrians dont count. In fact they might as well not exist. Maybe the author thinks they should not exist given her sympathies. But they do and the fact that a bourgeois and unarguably repressive government still retains so much support and that the supposedly progressive opposition consistently refuses to engage in peace negotiations and settle things through fair elections is never reckoned with by the imperialist left. Not much is reckoned with by the imperialist left really. They dont have to the Washington Post has already thought them what to think.,communism,cwucedm,4,t5_2qolz

If a real and irreconcilable interpersonal contradiction comes up then one or both parties should leave. Why does the entire organization have to split over interpersonal problems that dont have a political basis? If there was a situation of abuseassault which is an interpersonal problem with a political basis Id think that if there was a split because the leadership was harboring an abuser or viceversa an abuser was ejected and their supporters left and that was the split there would be a distinct interest in making that known. I just cant think of any legitimate reasons to keep the reasons for a split secret. If there are legitimate reasons to split then they should be able to explain them to people its liberal to say people cant understand complex situations and that we must vulgarize and oversimplify our line to make it easy to explain.,communism,d0beae8,1,t5_2qolz

It all changed on that fateful day.I was browsing rmeirl when I saw a funny communist post. I went to the comments section had another laugh and saw the rFULLCOMMUNISM subreddit linked by a random user. I thought to myself damn Reddit has it all better check that out I wonder what kind of humour that is clicked the link laughed a lot read the comments and saw people worshipping Stalin and congratulating the DPRK. That got me intrigued. Up until now I thought Stalin betrayed Lenin and was a ruthless dictator so I informed myself on the subject.

Theres a glaring issue in North American leftism which is that many nominally communist organizations more or less have no ties to the indigenous peoples and so they have no ability to theoretically or practically chart out what decolonization would look like when informed by a leninistmlm perspective. If liberation is impossible without these tools in the era of capitalist imperialism then in theory decolonization would need leninismmlm.

Though I suppose if the rest of the left is content with union organizing and fantasizing about esque workers revolts then they can go ahead and do that.

If reform led to socialism America wouldve gone communist after the New Deal.

Heres the relevant bitgtWells Is there a great difference between a small revolution and a great reform? Is not a reform a small revolution?gtStalin Owing to pressure from below the pressure of the masses the bourgeoisie may sometimes concede certain partial reforms while remaining on the basis of the existing socialeconomic system.gtActing in this way it calculates that these concessions are necessary in order to preserve its class rule. This is the essence of reform. Revolution however means the transference of power from one class to another. That is why it is impossible to describe any reform as revolution. That is why we cannot count on the change of social systems taking place as an imperceptible transition from one system to another by means of reforms by the ruling class making concessions.,communism,d7tptry,13,t5_2qolz

On a small scale workers could sell their products of labor to others while not consuming their own products. On a large scale the products made by workers would have to be only consumed by those who do not work Capitalists and consumers who do not work such as retirees. Such products may be those of scientists who do not consume the bulk of the fruits of their research or financial workers whose bulk of work are consumed by capitalists. If the OPs analysis and this comment hold correct it would seem possible to be able to unionize such people since they would want higher pay and would not be consuming their products of labor anyways.

As time goes by it doesnt get any more believable just because an anonymous account on Reddit says it is true.gtIf youre joking this is not funny. A self proclaimed Third Worldist telling a person who was born raised and lived many years in a Third World country that hes...not from a Third World country?Youre an anonymous account on the internet writing in English. People claim to be people theyre not all the time. Why should anyone believe you and why would you expect them to?If you wanted people to believe you youd produce more analysis that doesnt depend on saying I live here its true. This type of reasoning works to convince people on a superficial level. Its like what the gusanos in Miami say about Cuba. If you believe them youd think Che personally killed thousands upon thousands of uncles.gtOn to the nationalism issue The fierce nationalism that i described applies more to the general population than CPV members. While I wouldnt deny theres a nationalist faction within the CPV small but does exist the CPV is mostly composed of corrupted careerists. Thats why even if the proUS faction gained an overwhelming majority CPV wont collapse.At this point the reader should take note of some things.. The user basically agrees about the relationship between communism and nationalism. If the population didnt have a nationalist sentiment it would never have been possible for the CPV to gain power.. The actual experience of the collapse of Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia doesnt inform this persons analysis at all. Nowhere do corrupt careerists hold on to power with no support from atleast a significant minority of the population. This is a fantasy.Notice also there is no attempt at documenting more important claims. How does this person know the nationalist faction is small? Did he take a survey? Of course not. The evidence is I live here believe me. And Che killed the uncles of every Cuban living in Miami.gtAs of right now positions within the CPV opens up opportunities for selfenrichment through embezzlement and cronyism.Here is the perfect opportunity for you to agitate people then. You can write political material calling out whatever corruption you see while draping yourself in communism and nationalism. The scoundrel XXX is stealing money from the people of our great nation in order to enrich themselves! We must do something!Does someone calling themselves a MarxistLeninist need someone to point out the obvious to them? No. The point is to spread antiCPV propaganda to an audience that reads people like Tony Cliff.gtThey here I would assume are the heroic nationalist anti imperialist CPV members of the old days since you mentioned how they waged war against the French and the Americans. Unfortunately these people dont exist in large numbers in the CPV anymore. Theyre dead.So says an anonymous Reddit account. Vietnam is full of nationalist sentiment from the general population yet theyre helpless sheeple unable to learn basic lessons from their very recent history. Also pay no attention to how the Eastern Bloc collapsed without a fight.Edit I was sure one the articles I was thinking of that was predicting the collapse of CPV was from a well known Vietnam war historian but I had a bit of difficulty finding it. To see even Leftwing Vietnamwatchers have been predicting the collapse of the CPV for years here is the famous now deceased scholar Gabriel Kolko saying it in his  article Vietnam the US and China Here is a quote from itgtGiven the tremendous and growing disparity between Vietnams nominal MarxistLeninist ideology and its stateled capitalist practice Vietnam is as ripe for overthrow as any nation has ever been and Vietnams present rulers should take very little for grantedno more indeed than those who ran the former U S S R.  Basic change is very likely to occur in Vietnam how and when cannot be predicted precisely but the anomaly between its ideology and its practice is too overwhelming to persist indefinitely.  The higher levels of the Party are now very corrupt and increasingly cynical and the patriotic legitimacy it had when it led the struggle against the French and then the Americans is gone. The younger generation of Vietnamese increasingly regard the Communists as corruptionists who practice nepotism.As you can see the line being put forth is nearly identical. It wasnt convincing to me  years ago when I read this article and it isnt convincing to me now.,communism,d9johur,1,t5_2qolz
9567065,0,t3_5byac0,Terrible analysis blatantly FirstWorldist. Some of it borders on the hysterical like calling the SYNA Hiteresque.It wont be long till the leaders of these Red Guards find themselves in the ranks of the Democratic Party. This is always where the Fight the SuperRight line leads people. Its the line of the CPUSA the RCPUSA and basically every other Left group that is ideologically dominated by the Democratic Party.The simple reality is that America is now much too diverse for the imperialist bourgeoisie to do fascism as commonly imagined and get away with it. A radicalized white working class would rip America to shreds. The imperialist bourgeoisie have known this for a very very long time. The FBI spends a lot more time investigating infiltrating and disrupting rightwing groups than they do leftwing ones.To quote J. Sakais excellent essay The Shock of RecognitiongtObviously rightist political views that touch on fascism are held by many white Americans. Theyre conditionally loyal to the government and in the government only because their level of prosperity and privilege is so high that why should they lift their faces from the trough? But if the u.s. capitalist class left it to a democratic vote of its white citizens known fascists like David Duke would be in the u.s. senate there would be no W.T.O. but also no Civil Rights Act and much of America would proudly fly the Confederate flag of the slavemasters. The imperialist States largest domestic security priority is not terrorism the ghetto or the border as they pretend but restraining and defusing white settler rebellion to the right.The imperialist bourgeoisie are gambling on socialfascism for their victory over the entire planet. American imperialism will have a Left face. A Left face is all many groups need to get behind whatever imperialist adventure the US government wants.Such a gamble does put the white working class in a very awkward position as both a simultaneous beneficiary of imperialist superprofits and a potential ally to all the oppressed nations of the world as a potentially violent enemy of the US government. When things are actually heating up people should expect to see extremely sharp political battles inside the trade unions. This isnt currently happening which is a reflection of the majority tendency to see the imperialist state as benefiting them.As the people of the world push back and the imperialist pie gets smaller and smaller this contradiction will manifest itself more and more. The US government will very easily morph itself into a socialdemocratic version of itself. It can very very easily go further Left than Bernie Sanders and survive as an imperialist state. America will get its own SYRIZA one day but the internal resistance will almost certainly be based in some form of white nationalism.If the forces of communism have a prayer of winning over the US population it will only come after these forces make a move against the US government. Once they are at war with each other it will become possible to open up another front against the US government. Then and only then will it be politically possible for communists to win over the majority of the white working class. This is because the US government will try to get the forces of white nationalism to attack the communists and it will then be possible to go to the white working class and say See they are the ones working with the government not us. The communists will also certainly need a very very clear line on the National Question as it relates to North America if they have a prayer of winning.,communism,d9sc4cv,11,t5_2qolz

As far as I understand it Fascism is defined as being deeply nationalist and ethnocentric. Idk if Hitler or Mussolini wanted to spread their influence across the globe but they certainly were not looking to do it inclusively. My impression is that their goal was autarky and a restoration of some real or imagined historical birth place. I think that you can get more nuanced or explore the realpolitik of it all but just rhetorically that difference is enormous. Fascisms ultimate goal is state control over the economy and classes. Communists believe that the state is an extension of the bourgeois class and has to be eliminated entirely.

9830986,0,t3_5g1deq,Youll have to excuse me because not only am I not particularly well acquainted with fascism and thus not fully qualified to answer your question wholly but also that fascism is very hard to define with distinct parameters because there was no leading intellectual or one distinct work that defines it like there is with Marxism. Ill talk primarily about Nazism when I speak about fascism in this post. The TLDR of it is that primarily because fascism spawned out of Social Darwinism and communism out of Historical Materialism. This causes massive difference of views on fundamental levels. For example people are products of their bloodline in fascism and thus undesirable untrustworthy or the opposite etc whilst Marxists see people as a product of the situation that they are born in to. Another example would be how fascists see and use the state they see the state as an instrument to preserve pure and desirable bloodlines and to protect people from inferior races this then leads to national struggle and international imperialism and conquest genocide sterilization whatever. Marxists see the state as a tool of the ruling class and thus wish to acquire it so they can abolish classes and make all equal. I could go on but you get the point the difference between the underlying ideologies of Social Darwinism and Historical Materialism are so far apart on practically every view that they could be considered polar opposites if one so wished.,communism,daozz3n,1,t5_2qolz

10244038,0,t1_dc55baz,gt How did the lumpenproletariat change and if so was is qualitatively?To some extent the criminalization of everything and the growth of the security state means that the lumpen no longer consist solely of pimps and gangsters as Marx put it. Theyre made up of people pushed into this class due to a very different criminal justice system. The bulk of them including violent criminals are in on charges either related to drugs or property e.g. violence in the course of a propertyrelated crime. Theyre often the most marginalized individuals and theyre also some of the individuals most aware of the brutal aspects of the capitalist system that is to say the prisons and police from first hand experience. Im not sure Marx took into account the fact that the bulk of those lumpen prisoners would be black too and suffer in addition because of that. Those are all qualitative changes.Meanwhile what Huey observed which I think we still see today is that the white working class in the United States for whatever reason shows very little revolutionary activity. As opposed to the white working class of the late th and early th century. That was an observation of his in an era when there was a lot of revolutionary sentiment too certainly more than today. Now this may not be the case globally and Huey didnt reject the revolutionary potential of the US white working class. Nor do I. But I dont believe they are the most receptive to a revolutionary message nor do I believe they are the most likely to act upon it when compared with the US lumpen.Further reading about the roles of prisons in Spain Italy and Greece as being essentially greenhouses for radical anarchists I think weve continuously seen some of the most revolutionary activity in the last few decades embarked upon by the lumpen. An example recently in the news a Greek anarchist of Revolutionary Struggle was arrested.  hours later today their comrades ambushed a police convoy.,communism,dc57vr8,9,t5_2qolz

10730809,0,t3_5tc1qa,Klimans politics are shitty. What else is new? Anyway your question is interesting but Im not sure it has an answer since third worldism is really only developing in the field of political economy now. Like the old works were in many ways dependent on monopoly capital theory which is really neoRicardian rather than Marxian or a kind of Luxemburgian overaccumulation theory. They had good politics but incoherent theory. This is a problem for example I  agree with John Smiths analysis of contemporary imperialism and his summary of the fundamental correctness of dependency theory on the fundamental issues  years looking back even their economics was a bit janky sometimes. But I am unconvinced of his attempt to elevate absolute surplus value to the determinant of imperialism which is really a way of finding something outside of capitalism to blame like monopoly or lack of realization was in cruder forms. This is like the revolutionary version of Harveys accumulation by dispossession since it leads to better politics but still finds something outside of normal abstract capitalism thats the problem. The strength of Kliman and others which forgives their bad politics is that their theory of crisis is both immanent to Marxs method and capitalist production itself. If were going to go forward and find the political economy of imperialism I think were going to have to do it ourselves these ppl are too old and too stuck in past polemics and too isolated from the real class struggle to advance their understanding. The growth of antirevisionist MarxismLeninism along with the flourishing of Marxian economics particularly over cultural analysis of history is no coincidence the material conditions are developing in which better theory can develop. ,communism,ddmswry,1,t5_2qolz

Excellent piece particularly  its serious and objective tone compared to the paranoid immature and hysterical tone of the Louis Proyect piece. Of course Proyect is writing for an audience that has already made up their minds but its still reassuring that anticommunism sounds indistinguishable from creationism when brought into the light. One of the first things that made me investigate leftism was how serious and clear Chomsky was while his critics were embarrassing when directly confronted in debate or to back up their claims with sources.
