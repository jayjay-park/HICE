9674395,0,t1_da3fvgg,I like em both.. learning new tricks indefinitely go with the titans. Something about that weight and stability. For indoor quieter use it is usually the hydras that win out. They are sort of comfy feeling ,begleri,da5klx1,2,t5_38h2z

9817444,0,t1_dalw9jn,TauMetalWorks on etsy the owner is hugo silva and hes super friendly and worked with me to make sure he understood exactly what I wanted. Hes also got very reasonable pricing for the work he does and didnt charge me extra for shipping. The price he negotiated is the price I paid. Im very satisfied so far!,begleri,dan8c8b,1,t5_38h2z
10118627,0,t3_5kt286,I only watched the rebounds so far Im cooking but the production quality was great. Slowmo is extremely helpful for begleri tuts. Explanation was straightforward of course theyre rebounds but still. Im a fan!Edit it would be beneficial to use the terminology developed by the begleri community already such as slip instead of pass. Unless were going to be changing the terminology for begleri to match.,begleri,dbqgqmc,1,t5_38h2z
10133203,0,t3_5l1ymw,Looks like that paracord was tied or braided for a while then undone would recommend buying some new paracord maybe thinner too,begleri,dbsd12e,1,t5_38h2z

10225214,0,t1_dc2q897,This was actually the first time Id ever made a monkeys fist without a jig. I used that method of wrapping it around the index and little fingers and using the thumb to hold it in place. So the hardest part was probably the point where you slide it off your fingers and try to keep it from turning into a big jumbled mass of cord while you do the third set of passes. Wrapping it around your fingers is easy and pulling out all the slack is easy the that one step in the middle was hard. It took me a few tries and had to unravel it all and start over a few times but I eventually got the hang of it.,begleri,dc332up,2,t5_38h2z
10236853,0,t3_5mle18,You can find them here. Im excited about the new design which is machined with a Delrin exterior and a brass interior for more weight than the aluminum design.,begleri,dc4ekha,2,t5_38h2z

10499914,0,t1_dcy68hj,No this isnt a collaboration I purchased them off of Aroundsquare.  If you click the link there is a description that explains where they come from.  Good question though thanks for asking!,begleri,dcy9y7d,1,t5_38h2z

10927397,0,t3_5w1xfv,This would be great though I cant play with mine because my son always wants them and takes it away. My wife ended up letting him have it when I was at work and he lost the string and a ball |,begleri,de731t6,1,t5_38h2z

11610341,0,t3_65p05z,Nice! Weights and material? One looks a little shorter than the other one.,begleri,dgc1ja0,2,t5_38h2z
11610395,0,t3_65nk0l,Awesome review! I bought some Kokonuts on release also and they still took a bit to get to me. I originally put some  on my first set but a second set I won I put some orange  on and now they play amazing. I tried  on a dif set but I found it to be a little too limp for me. The shape of the beads does help it play like a heavier set at least Ive felt that way since I got Ti Titans to compare to.I agree about the Monkeychords I dont like how they stretch. Its never the same so the timing for things is offlike you said and I felt like the string was getting twistedcaught far more often during rolls and the like.,begleri,dgc1r75,3,t5_38h2z
