8483697,0,t1_d61h7cg,Obviously that is true you would have to be crazy to dismiss the business side of this. But you said it yourself Star Wars is HUGE so huge in fact that at this point its almost considered public domain just because the sheer amount of people who care about the franchise. So yes this is about more than just profits and integrity. Keep in mind that Frontwire Studios offered to EA so they could release it on their platform. Which would be profit for them for little no no work but they still refused and that right there is where you see what they really care about and let me tell you its not money or protecting the IP.,GalaxyinTurmoil,d620a34,-1,t5_3d7v9
