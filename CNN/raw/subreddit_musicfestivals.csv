There are hundreds going on in the next month or two and I can only view the  or  there. Cool idea needs more content to make it a useful music festival database. ,musicfestivals,cjyfxbf,4,t5_2r0rm

3222675,0,t3_2x0ukz,I took your survey.  In regards to phones I honestly dont care. Im  short so sometimes its nice to see the stage through someones phone.  I rewatch all my videos fairly often so I do not find them to be a waste of time.  I take  videos a show depending how into the music I am and what is going on around me.  I dont waste my time with snapchat because I dont care to be worrying who I need to send this video to when I just want a quick  second video and then to get back to business.  I understand longer videos could be more annoying to people but I would rather have one  second video of the show than multiple  second clips which do not do a justice to the music.   ,musicfestivals,cow17i5,1,t5_2r0rm

11153382,0,t1_dew7xly,Ive seen on their twitter replies to people saying that they are not allowing hydration packs in but that they have water available but Ive seen and heard from people that went last year that have said water was like .... Im really hoping theyre not pulling through with all this but sadly festivals dictate their own rules and can do whatever they want so if they chose to make their money that way they know people will still come and spend money on water... rip theyre not a camping festival or anything so theyre technically allowed to do that bs I just hate knowing Im going to have to spend half my money on water just to not pass out ,musicfestivals,dew82sg,1,t5_2r0rm
11510394,0,t3_648m43,I pulled up the carpet in my suvnot really pulled it up but shoved some stuff in a hole under the seat...laid the seat down and put stuff on top of the seat basically they would never think to look there. If they did it would take them  minutes just to get to the spot. Tldr pull your seat up and see if you got any carpet you can stash it under. Then fold seat back down. ,musicfestivals,dg0pdsk,3,t5_2r0rm
