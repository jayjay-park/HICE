1808879,0,t3_2f7ucp,Do you have this button enabled? If you only record arm the track using the left button your midi input will only be recorded when using the record button and it doesnt pass the midi data to your synth.,StudioOne,ck7567t,1,t5_2y01n
4948163,0,t1_cui7toi,No... what youre describing is a lot of work and the reason a freeze feature would exist.The reason to freeze a track is to spare CPU usage on all the plugins in that track and yes the MIDI instrument gt audio conversion which may be among the most intensive.That said you cant just mute the old track. When you bounce these changes are made permanent. No more tweaking. So you must export the raw audio  MIDI prior to the bounce and back it up bounce it then delete the old track. And when you want to tweak it again you must delete the bounce reimport add all the plugins back in and there you are.vs. hitting a freeze button as in LPX.Hopefully theyll add this feature down the road but for now...anyway thanks for trying to help!,StudioOne,cui98ie,1,t5_2y01n
6200748,0,t1_cyuf6jn,Unless you have something like live drums or some other live thing with good humanized feel I dont see a huge use case that doesnt involve outside stuff but who knows different genres are different and you might find some creative way to employ it. Just fyi though Ableton has the same thing and they call it Groove Pool,StudioOne,cyugiti,1,t5_2y01n

9329451,0,t1_d8yhyds,I have not but it gets a gold WINE rating  I had tried a couple others though Ardour and NON which are linux based.,StudioOne,d8ykqsh,1,t5_2y01n
9704464,0,t3_5e2pvh,Im not entirely sure what youre asking but the volume can be adjusted from the clips themselves by dragging that handle at the top middle of the clip or from the mixer which you dont seem to want to do for some reason or from a mixtool plugin.And Im not sure what you mean by messy. Organize name and group your tracks. Some people even color their tracks.,StudioOne,da9a7jo,3,t5_2y01n
10767921,0,t1_dc53bpm,I will do that as I had given up. Thank you much!,StudioOne,ddqmqiz,1,t5_2y01n
10960518,0,t1_deahr5d,Yeah that is kinda true keeping it visually calm is important and one of the things S does great. However to me it would make much more sense to have stuff like that at least the phase in the clip menu.,StudioOne,deai08u,1,t5_2y01n
11084143,0,t3_5y6j93,Its a learning curve for laymen like me but once youve got it its great. ,StudioOne,deodm2g,1,t5_2y01n
11532920,0,t1_dg2vm08,theyre on the same track but you can set them independently by choosing to show the parameter you want and then setting their automation mode independently.,StudioOne,dg39bly,1,t5_2y01n
11800377,0,t1_dgx9x2i,Other than Absynth and Predator I havent heard of any of those. I got some researching to do! ,StudioOne,dgxm3k4,2,t5_2y01n
