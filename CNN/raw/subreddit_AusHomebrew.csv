311870,0,t1_cfd1iid,Fantastic thanks for the reply.I am looking to use it as a fermentation chamber. The freezer should be deep enough that it wont need a wooden collar on it but I will make sure to test the depth.I typically use an immersion homebrew heater fish heater style in the winter would you still use this in the fermentation chamber? I am in Victoria so it can get quite cold as well as quite hot.. I am thinking you would set the immersion heater a few degrees below the freezer cutin so that they dont fight each other too much. Or is this not typically done? Looking to improve my temperature control overall really as it currently varies somewhat to the high side.,AusHomebrew,cfd3e3w,2,t5_306bq
1635200,0,t1_cjl67yk,I bought my false bottom from Beerbelly  Then I got a hose barb from a local hose amp tubing company along with a length of food grade tubing.  The esky came with a nice little threaded insert that screwed into the main tap hole so the hose barb screwed into that and I used the tubing and hose clamps to connect the tubing to the false bottom.  That left just screwing in the tap on the outside.  It was really easy and cost less than .You could really easily do the same exact thing with SS braid instead of a false bottom to save .,AusHomebrew,cjla5tw,1,t5_306bq
