27704,0,t1_cehkykj,Maybe but here is a difference between rushing something and planning a timeline. Over the pays year weve had no less than  contradictory statements from DCWB over a JL movie. ,comicbookmovies,cehl4fk,2,t5_2qx71
42516,0,t3_1ukvqo,No. Zack Snyder had specifically stated that he wants to put as much mythology as they can so that they may build of of it in the future. Warner Brothers executive had even expressed WB amp DCs desire to make a full wonder woman movie. Zack Snyder also said that this movie will be a SUPERMAN AND BATMAN centric movie and not a Justice League.  That means that WW most likely have a small role or a cameo. WB had even hinted at making some lower budget movies after the JL movie. This could mean that they will go back and retell the origins of WW Batman Deathstroke  ect... Dont worry. They are constantly teaming up with DC for help. I dont think they will mess it up because Wonder Woman is a very iconic character and needs to be done right.,comicbookmovies,cej9sa2,5,t5_2qx71

127984,0,t1_cesnkgy,I agree that the characters really suck on the show but not that the writers need to utilize established Marvel Universe characters to be good. Way back when in the comics there were always small series and big series and more often than not they were pretty much unconnected and doing their own things.Series writers developed cool stories or bad ones completely separately from whatever was going on in other series. You could read through  issues of say ManThing or Alpha Flight or Ghost Rider or whatever without encountering a guest appearance. Sure sometimes SpiderMan or Wolverine would drop in to help sales but if the stories were crap no one stuck around. And really whats stopping AoS writers from writing their own good characters and original plotlines? Its not like its never been doneCoulson himself is exhibit A.Nope the culprit here is simply bad formulaic writing like anything on network TV.,comicbookmovies,cet07sc,0,t5_2qx71

And I always think of Roscoe Lee Brown who voiced Kingpin in the animated series from the s. It wasnt super deep but it had such a sinister edge. But DOnofrio is a good actor.

I could deal with that as long as its not just his hair we see him badly hurt and he doesnt go around pissing and moaning about just hair.  He could be pissed at Superman because of his alien influence and all the postCOIE type of attitude and add the layer of Supermans action taking away part of his vitality and strength through this accident. I could dig that just as long as they dont make it all about the hair.Id prefer though really for Lex to just be bald.  Maybe he starts out with hair then shows up with a shaved head.

2372373,0,t1_cm4xjba,POSSIBILITY ONE Goofier XMenThe first XMen movie was released in . Wikipedia tells me there was an early script that featured a kinda silly looking Beast a higher focus on the personal rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops the XCopter Sentinels and Magneto as the cause of the Chernobyl disaster. This script was rejected  was it because it had too many goofy things in it? Maybe Fox was afraid of falling into the Batman and Robin goofy trap. If Batman and Robin didnt exist they might have chosen this goofier script.Would Goofier XMen have been less successful than real XMen? Would it have been as critically panned as Batman and Robin? Probably not. But maybe. And if XMen had failed the modern era of comicbook movies might never have begun. SpiderMan was stuck in development hell for  years  without the success of XMen to boost confidence maybe it wouldve stayed there. Without SpiderMan to boost confidence Iron Man might not have been made.People say XMen and SpiderMan kicked off the era of modern superhero movies. If they werent the huge successes they were then we may not have superhero movies at all. Remember when that pirate movie flopped and everybody stopped making pirate movies for ages?

The fight becomes him vs ZOD. However genius Tony Stark is flawed as all hell. Hes more human and wouldnt have the power or the ability to move the fight to someplace of his choosing.

You cant blame a company for making what the fans flock to and then go on to say that same company doesnt look at what fans go to.Im not saying that they dont look at what the fans go to. Like you said DC knows that the fans like Marvels stuff. But they cant produce Marvels stuff. All they know how to produce competently is Batman. I blame them on some level because they dont understand their own characters or how to use them. I blame the fans because the fans buy the fuck out of Batman and dont bother learning whats interesting about the other characters. gtTheyve confirmed which characters from the current shows will be going over onto the new one. None of them are dark and I doubt theyll make them dark for the new show especially since theyre going there to draw people in.I covered this. Green Arrow was one of the lightest characters in the DCU. You dont know what theyre going to do.gtThe fanbase gave them reason to want to make dark films  years ago. Batman BeginsThe Dark Knight started the trend. Theyre sticking with what the fanbase wanted  years ago not today.The fanbase also responded more positively to Man of Steel a dark Superman movie than to Superman Returns a lighter Superman movie. Are you forgetting about The Dark Knight Rises?gtThe mere fact that were sitting here agreeing that DCs dark and gritty films stink shows that the fans dont want it anymore. Were not in the minority.Did you notice that I got the shit down voted out of me for saying this? Were DEFINITELY in the minority. Most people like Man of Steel. Most people like the Nolan films. Most people are pumped for BvS. gtTo clarify. I dont dislike DCs films because theyre dark. I dislike them because they focused too much on the tone and not just good writing.Agreed. ,comicbookmovies,cqg2e1s,1,t5_2qx71

Everything I have heard about Ray Fisher has me excited his theater performances have been highly touted by some top people. Momoa I was worried could only play a big powering bad ass character with no depth until I saw Road to Paloma and The Red Road which gave me faith in his ability to add depth to Aquaman.All in all Im excited about this cast and honestly cannot wait to see the Justice League movie just to see how the team interacts.

A TV series wouldnt work because it would need to be on HBO and HBO wouldnt put up the money to make it look good. Sandman relies heavily on special effects. Those special effects actually have to look cool. Considering that its a very long story that takes place in multiple realms in multiple different eras of history with tons of different characters some of whom require makeup or CGI or elaborate costuming... no one is going to have the budget for this. A movie could work if you made just a single standalone story but it would need to be directed and written by someone who is very talented. Someone with a good eye.

4917729,0,t3_3i72t4,I love Joss Whedons work in Serenity but not a fan of The Avengers movies.  He makes the characters seem like morons with the fake tension between the characters they never have felt like a team they just seem like a bunch of guys called in because they have to.  Theres too much weak humor offset by boring melodrama.  He doesnt balance action and exposition well it feels like  hour start exposition in the first film then  hour of mediocre tv like action.  Theres no emotional weight the stakes dont seem to matter.  Villains are a joke and the CGI enemies ended up looking very fake especially in D.  I also dont think I feel like Im in the Marvel world.  Even reading  pages of an XMen comic I feel like Im in this other universe.  I feel like Im in a parody of the real world with these movies.  Age of Ultron was a fucking mess.  That Thor scene? No directors cut? There was so much shit that happened that wasnt that interesting or important.  The action choreography was outstanding but the CGI in the first two acts look like shitty  ps cinematic footage that you couldnt suspend your disbelief but in the third act it looked good did they get another studio or production to do the rd act?  Story was a mess doesnt stick with you Ultron was not a villain I could take seriously.  They made this twist that hes a creation of Stark and partly him they could have gone into interesting territory there but didnt.  Scarlet Witch is an asshole.  She basically unleashes Hulk because she blames Stark Industries for destroying her home but does the same fucking thing by unleashing the Hulk who CLEARLY causes tons of damage to a city for a few minutes until Stark comes in to stop then CONVENIENTLY says a line Oh Im going to throw you into an empty building so critics of Man of Steel cant criticize Joss Whedon because Im saying this line in the movie despite the fact Hulk probably killed a few dozen people in his rampage and probably destroyed a bunch of shops of small business owners who are probably fucked for a year or two in their livelihood but o well by the way THIS ISNT MAN OF STEEL. AND THEN SCARLET WITCH FEELS BAD THAT PEOPLE ARE ENDANGER LATER IN THE MOVIE AND TURNS ON ULTRON WTF.  You know who fucking does that? Assholes and criminals.  I sympathize with her back story but you caused so much destruction because of your emotions you should go to jail.  Winter Solider is an excellent film but just when the themes and story get really interesting that could have a lot of social commentary they go all easy and go GAH NAZI CONSPIRACY O NO WE CAN SAVE THE DAY BY EXPOSING ALL THE GOVERNMENT SECRETS WE DONT KNOW HOW THAT ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING GOOD BUT LETS DESTROY SHIELD EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A TV SHOW BASED ON THIS BUT FUCK CONNECTING THE UNIVERSES THEY CAN ADJUST.  O yeah action was very well choreographed but shooting style didnt feel unique cinematic or that solid felt very TV like.  I know the directors are from TV maybe thats why?  If you ask my Winter Soldier should be the minimal standard of how good a Marvel movie should be anything less shouldnt be a movie but a TV movie.  The Amazing SpiderMan  is not a horrible film it actually has some memorable emotional weight and interesting action just seemed like they didnt know what to do with movie.Man Of Steel is a decent action movie and it also feels a lot more original than most comic book movies.  Its got a lot of flaws but the common ones people bitch about the most are just stupid. People also forget its supposed to be an introduction to a new cinematic universe so theres still more to the story of Superman to see.  The Dark Knight Rises had an awesome ending and thematic elements making the climb scene but was not a great Batman story.XMen Last Stand is a good movie its just a terrible XMen story that didnt do the franchise or the fans justice at the time.  Hell at least it felt like it was about something and the special effects still look better than movies that came out  years later.XMen origins is a fun rental action movie but again a horrible XMen story.    SpiderMan  is a horrible Spiderman movie but if you dont take it too seriously somewhat fun to watch.,comicbookmovies,cuef1tg,1,t5_2qx71

Its so iconic that if you changed it and removed the cowl everyone would be upset. They did it with Batgirl in Batman and Robin though. Alicia Silverstone found the cowl uncomfortable so they went with the domino mask.,comicbookmovies,cuellqc,10,t5_2qx71
4943594,0,t1_cuhmx9m,It purely came down to the kind of film I wanted to see. I really like a strong plot and character arcs and I didnt feel like Guardians had either. What it did have it did really well I can acknowledge that it is a well done film but very much removed from what I like to watch or read if you want to keep this in a comic context.To me everyone saying it was this generations Star Wars was a load of crap because through it all Star Wars still had a plot carrying the whole thing. Guardians felt like a lot of dicking around which is fine for those that like that I just dont particularly.Also not to be a prude but I was taken aback by the level of profanity and sexual humor just because Marvel hadnt gone that far yet with their movies.

Now maybe you have a problem with the fact Tony built Ultron and Ultron copied Tony which is a different discussion. But Ultrons quips were in the context of the movie appropriate.

Im certainly not trying to rob Guardians of its visual merits because at the very least it is a funlooking movie. Its costuming set design and sfx are topnotch after all. But I honestly dont think the movie did much with its visuals to aid the storytelling other than give it a glossy aesthetic. I also agree that Man of Steels desaturated color pallet did leave some to be desired in that regard. However I would argue I think its cinematography was far more deliberate in telling a story in addition to having much stronger framing altogether. And while the framing centered on the overt Messianic framing were at times painfully blunt I think theres plenty of other better symbolic and thematicallycentered visually composed shots. ,comicbookmovies,cxiu4fc,3,t5_2qx71

6325285,0,t1_cz8lxs9,That is not the point. People have the opinions they have. Just because you can point to things and say they are wrong does not invalidate their feelings.The simple fact is that MoS has been described correctly as divisive. Some fans like it. Some dont. A reaction that is far worse than any Marvel film has gotten.The reason for this is simple it was made by a studio that cares more about the general audience than it does the fans. Marvel Studios cares quite a lot about the general audience too of course. But the difference is that they respect the fans far more. So while there is the occasional misstep ie Mandarin mostly they make movies that appeal equally to both sides of the fence.Want to know the harsh truth? WB does not give a flying fuck about the fans because they know they will show up no matter what. This is the traditional attitude movie studios have always had about fans of anything. Marvel will never put the fans first but they at least care more and the results of that speak for themselves.I honestly hope that the WB crew learned from MoS and that BvS is amazing and does really really well. But until they have produced a good halfdozen films I will remain cautious about them. The traditional wisdom has always been along the lines of If you loved the book you will hate the movie and WB will have to prove they can get beyond that to earn my trust. I hope they do. The Heros of DC deserve the same sort of run that the Marvel Heros have.,comicbookmovies,cz8m71i,1,t5_2qx71

7070089,0,t1_d1fcege,It bothers me too. This Superman was played out as stupid. He is emotionally unstable seemingly selfish and easily fooled. I never asked for the comic character to be recreated exactly on screen but Come on! He can hear Lois screaming for help from across the globe but he cant notice a bomb in a court room? He lets Lex just taunt him with pics of his mom and can do nothing other than bend to his whim? He tries to talk down Batman but gives up even though we have a clock ticking on his moms death?! This Superman has proven himself to be far more resourceful and definitely more thoughtful than this in Man of Steel. And he is so tightlipped in this movie for no discernible reason. We could have shaved  minutes off this movie if he just spoke up about his own reputation and attempted to resolve it. Instead we get a short montage of him saving people and him going for a hike have a barely coherent conversation with his dad. The root of my problem with this Superman is in the supposed dichotomy between him and Batman. If Batman is the dangerous necessity Superman is the controlled inspiring protector. He is hope he is light. That doesnt mean that he cant be without flaws. Sure be uncertain of yourself. Sure make a few fuckups. But he should always try just as Batman does. In this movie he embodies seemingly nothing. And thats a problem.Its all the writing and not understanding your characters.,comicbookmovies,d1hra4p,2,t5_2qx71

Of course well have to see how well it translate into the final product but still in some ways it sounds like some of DC Rebirths hope and optimism is infecting the movies. I wonder if that has anything to do with Geoff Johns increased involvement.Im happy for a multitude of reasons that it sounds like theyre playing it safe with the Justice League movie. For starters Warner needs to really generate some positive goodwill with general audiences. Snyder also seriously needs some reigning in. But Im also happy theyre getting their generic invasion out of the way with Steppenwolf and not Darkseid. Id love to see Darkseids eventual invasion take on some of the more creative and original aspects of Final Crisis imaginative apocalyptic invasionstreamlining andor nixing Morrisons overly complex aspects for general audiences of course.  ,comicbookmovies,d4irgw1,11,t5_2qx71

Not stupid but no big feat considering Lois in these is a damsel in distress on the level of Daphne from Scooby Doo.

Maybe push Wonder Woman ahead of it since its a prequel anyways or put a Suicide Squad movie which could be more Batman heavy.  I dont really mind the movies being in a non linear order though.The one movie I would add though is a Flash amp Green Lantern movie before Justice League or depending on how theyd want to bill it maybe call it a Flash movie that heavily features Green Lantern a a supporting character.

So followjg the footstep of TDKR I mean Batman news covering broken bones ... of kid its very different in the comic than in the animation why take the animation? Youre contradicting yourself. One of the most ambiguous moment may be No bullet. Honest lol like that would justify anything the guy just look like a sadist going on his own vendetta against a demonization of the depraved youth that plays video games thats us btw which is most likely an off spring of what he offered the world.Anw ... So we agree some windows are left open it is purposefully ambiguous. And art is ultimately subjective ... So why the hell because there is a long stretch would you make a video titled Snyder gets his favorite comic wrong. Did you read to many clicbait title and it reprogrammed your brain? Because that is first of all reductive to the comic both in itself and as an art for and reductive of what it is telling otherwise. If Snyder is wrong about the killing he gets his favorite comic wrong? Nop. And using the animated movie when he is talking about the comic with a spacey music with the montage at the end you may want to review your technique on certain aspect ...Did rpoopandP get his own video wrong?   I had already seen the other video yeah she pretty much rocks.

10253424,0,t1_dc66aj9,Id say that it may be more accurate to say half of comic book fans did not find the theatrical movie to be enjoyable. Going back to what I said about the number still being significant its the comic book fans that drive the weekend over weekend business via repeated viewing.From my understanding the Cinemascore is calculated from opening night in the  largest cities.  They will take  votes from each city.  In the case of comic book movies that may skew the score with respect to overall audience bc its the comic book fans that will rush to see these movies opening night.  The general audience may wait several days to weeks bc of how packed the theaters will be.  To skew things a bit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles got a B and its sequel got an A.  The sequel would be ranked up there with the Cinemascores of Captain America TFA Transformers AoE Thor TDW Man of Steel The Amazing Spiderman Spiderman and Spiderman .  The orginal  movie outgrossed the sequel globally by  to  M to M.  What that suggests is that while the sampled audience found the sequel to be more enjoyable the box office numbers did not reflect that in any way which could indicate the general movie audience didnt feel the same way.I hated the morphing Galvatron and I thought the movie was just boring overall. I was looking forward to seeing the Dinobots bc they were among my favorites as a kid but even their appearance was lackluster IMO.  As far as casting goes... Im not the biggest Shia fan but hes a more likeable character for Transformers films than Wahlberg. Thats weird bc I actually like Wahlberg as an actor as well as his movies more than I like Shia.  Duhamel and Tyrese worked well in the st  movies as the supplementary protagonists. TJ Miller is probably a cool guy but he was just annoying comic relief to me.  He seems like the same character in several of his movies and I cheer when his  character dies. The biggest thing I hated about Cloverfield was Millers commentary. I thought the shaky cam was easier to stomach.   I will say that I thought he was less annoying in Deadpool.  I thought the Witwicky parents were better comic relief.  I like to look at Nicola Peltz but I actually though Megan Foxs character was much better and had better chemistry with the lead Shia. I sometimes forget Rosie HW was even in the rd movie so I dont factor her into the lead female discussion.  ,comicbookmovies,dc6a5k9,1,t5_2qx71

10912493,0,t1_de5in66,I didnt like suicide squad. I couldnt get past the feeling i was watching a bunch of grownups trickortreating. But i watched it with an open mind despite thinking Will Smith was miscast and the strange approach to the Joker. I wasnt expecting Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill and i realized that they had to get creative after Ledgers epic performance and tragic death. I didnt go into with grit teeth or a stick up my ass.I know DC is messing up a great opportunity. Im not trying to defend them. But  for the most part these movies arent horrible theyre just not meeting their potential. But looking at the reactions to second viewings of the Star Wars movies the Marvel movies and other fanboy material weve waited decades for i think a vocal majority of us cant be pleased with what is getting put out. BvS was probably truer to the characters in mod more ways than the Dark Knight trilogy and those movies were flawed.DC could be doing much better. But that doesnt mean everything theyre doing is garbage. Ill save groans about Nightwing until after it comes out just like i did for SS. Everything else theyve done so far has beaten my expectations because Im choosing to keep them light and remembering that its impossible to represent  years of lore into a handful of movies.But yeah i dont need constant reminders about Bruces parents.

10993926,0,t1_dedolig,Yeah I enjoyed it a lot more than the other XMen movies. All the rest are kind of hokey CG superpower bonanzas that you could enjoy at least for the spectacle. This one was much more characterdriven and the relative lack of superpowers helped keep it grounded. I just kept thinking back to the old XMen movies and Xaviers mentor relationship with Logan and it all seemed very fitting to have Logan tenuously holding on to the last shred of his former life. I really think the violence added a lot to the movie especially in the scenes with X. Seeing those two shred each other to pieces like a meat grinder was such a powerful contrast to the relatively tame Lady Deathstrike scene in X. It really felt like Logan was fighting for his life... or whatever little was left of it.And I liked how the backstory was mostly hinted at or explained briefly mutations were suppressed by something in the water and food mutants were now only being made in labs and at one point on the radio they suggest that Professor X was responsible for killing some of the other XMen at the Winchester ? incident. All vague enough to keep me interested and looking for more clues.All in all I think this was a fitting ending for the two actors who helped define the superhero film genre. It didnt rely on whizbang special effects and I was pleasantly surprised by the emotional scenes between Xavier Logan and Laura. Sometimes sweet sometimes sad and when Logan took all those drugs to make sure the kids made it to the border I had a little hell yeah moment. Im not sure I can see such finality ever making it into an MCU movie.,comicbookmovies,dee4kxz,13,t5_2qx71

11153749,0,t1_devztae,It doesnt matter how good the director is if WB intervenes.They try to take on too much at once. A big part of creating a universe is to let it unravel slowly and allow the characters to find themselves. DCCU is three movies and  main characters in and and lacks a coherent storyline. They are too busy setting up the next film to focus on the current.,comicbookmovies,dew9kqs,29,t5_2qx71

11239334,0,t1_df5wyxw,It wont be.  Sony is a terrible studio that cant stop tripping over its own feet with all their films suffering from too much executive meddling.  Combine that with the absolutely terrible track record Kings books have when it comes to film adaptation and the extremely complex nature of the story and its going to end up terrible.  Especially since they are apparently either skipping over The Gunslinger entirely or combining it with The Drawing Of the Three.I highly recommend not getting your hopes up.  Elba will be excellent but I suspect the story will be terrible.,comicbookmovies,df5yneq,2,t5_2qx71

11364732,0,t1_dfit84v,I dont think marvel has a say as to what Sony wants to do with spider man. Remember Sony is lending SpiderMan to marvel on an arrangement and agreement to marvel. Sort of how Warner brothers lend bugs bunny  to Disney for Rodger rabbit. Disney made a movie and built this cartoon world with their characters but Warner brothers still could make space jam. What Sony might want to do if they dont want to get of this money  train is work with marvel to brunch the fans to see their movie as well but they dont have to or obligated to do so.,comicbookmovies,dfk65qg,3,t5_2qx71

11435169,0,t1_dfs5puz,Nah The Avengers did not get critical reception in the same way as these other films. It was phenomenally success and did awesome box office and it certainly influenced other studios to jump on the shared universe bandwagon but it didnt receive universal critical acclaim. Winter Soldier was probably the one I would choose in terms of critical reception. Interestingly some of the reviews I read compared it to TDK. Thats sort of my point. The only film I read reviews of that was compared to TWS was Civil War. ,comicbookmovies,dfs5yb2,5,t5_2qx71

11467607,0,t1_dfv4iov,...but thats more in line for someone like Black Mask. Joker is a much more cerebral character always has been incorporating black humour into his plots even in his much more light hearted days.I could see a domestic terrorist or even an annoymous style hacker if ya really wanted to keep it grounded in reality Even if this reality has Aliens Witches Zombies and Mutants but this weird gangster latario just doesnt click with the basic ideals of The Joker.He come across as more Gotham City Imposter than Clown Prince of Crime.,comicbookmovies,dfvui1c,1,t5_2qx71

11654515,0,t1_dgflxvk,Thats probably more to do with Chinas strict movie import laws.  China only allow like  US movie per year so studios have yo be picky about what they send over.

11717582,1,t3_6752er,DC needs to stick to animated comic book movies amp TV shows their live action movies have been pretty abysmal except the last set of Batman.The Fox stuff has always been pretty bad in my opinion.The actual Marvel stuff has been pretty good minus the ABC TV shows amp Iron Fist. Not much of a fan of the general TV shows mainly due to the fact that the networks hold onto the old ways so damn much that when you see all of the netflix stuff blow it out of the water.,comicbookmovies,dgo7tp9,0,t5_2qx71

11765120,0,t1_dgta4af,Thats you not liking the character not a problem with the character. My rebuttal is Superman  which is still highly regarded. Are you gonna tell me that people didnt like that Superman and Clark Kent? This movie did intend to have drama but it didnt show it very well. It was a story about how Superman could no longer get back together with Lois. An he felt kind of depressed by it. Making a character flawed does not equal making a good character. ,comicbookmovies,dgtlu5c,1,t5_2qx71
