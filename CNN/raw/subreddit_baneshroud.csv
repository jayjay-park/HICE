427910,0,t3_1yqmje,I have talked with Sly and Cactus a bunch about the issue. Obviously I am biased in favor of the unban but he did not break any written rules. I read through the entire rule book twice after his ban to check for a rule that he explicitly broke and there is none. I understand his taunting and immaturity may have been a pain for some but  in my eyes you cannot ban for that. Cactus says that he banned Sly due to constant complaints but says that it is was his and James decision. That contradicts itself. I would vote for a   month ban. Let him think out his actions and whatnot. We banned Osman for  months for Xraying and duping items literally the most severe transgressions. There is no way that Sly should be banned for more then that when he never actually broke a rule. Thanks Farmer SharmP.S I did NOT tell Sly to write this. He told me that he wrote it when we were playing cod. He also mentioned that Kyle said to write this to help get him back on. Dont interpret that as not caring though he didnt want to post anything as it would seem whiny. ,baneshroud,cfp49hn,2,t5_2us2v

2038432,0,t3_2hy9uv,Glad to here youre still around NC! Edhellond is still the largest town on the server due to players logging in periodically. If you need us to send new players your way we would be glad to! Hopefully I catch you on this weekend so I can explain the political turmoil that has been occurring. PvP is getting hot again. ,baneshroud,ckyxhtx,1,t5_2us2v
2048893,0,t1_cl06x10,I fixed it again. Whenever I update the server it defaults to sleep mode which I sometimes forget to turn off. That is now fixed. I guess when the server restarted or went into sleep mode it reset the mcMMO files. Right now all your data is back. There is a chance it will do it again on next restart and if it does I will configure it to work properly tomorrow morning.,baneshroud,cl09cbj,1,t5_2us2v

5292864,0,t3_3mszmi,RIP in pasta pepperoni spicy meatball No but seriously its a shame they had to shut down. Some of my best memories with you guys on the server revolve around this site. Its where Arty and Seeric first exposed me to Sabaton. chanting intensifies,baneshroud,cvo83zv,1,t5_2us2v
