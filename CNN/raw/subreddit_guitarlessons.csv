8377,0,t1_ceejt72,gt apparently according to context x can be used as a form of Bm.You have to look at the notes they contain    Bm  B D F A    Your chord  B D E ASo theyre similar. Your chord doesnt contain the F but dropping the  out of a chord voicing is very common in some settings especially jazz. Your chord also has an E which is a pretty note to add on top of a m chord.So this is a perfectly nice variation on a Bm that will work better in some situations than others but its not a plain vanilla Bm chord.,guitarlessons,cefe1kg,1,t5_2r8ca

32455,0,t3_1uhf63,Take the notes from the G major scale and try to make a chord with the A as root note i.e. an A chord  you dont know if its major or minor yetScale G A B C D E FA Chord a chord is usually made of the root note the third and the fifth from the root. A C E.Now lets see if this chord is a major or minor one. The A Major chord is built from the notes of the A Major scale A B C D E F G. So the A Major chord is A C E.Now you see the difference between a major and a minor chord is the number of semitones between the root and the third notes of the chord. So the A chord you are able to build from the G Major scale has a C while the A Major chord built from the A Major scale has a C. It follows that the A chord built from the G Major scale is an A minor.You can do the same with all the other notes from the scale. E.g.. Bm B D F . C C E G. D D F A.You can generalize this and have the following sequence of major and minor chords from any given major scale large Roman numerals represent major chords and small numerals represent minor onesI ii iii IV V vi viio,guitarlessons,cei4kdh,12,t5_2r8ca

The name comes from starting the scale on each different scale degree but its misleading because you can start in one position and end in the next which is a whole new position!The goal is restricting yourself to numbers of strings notes per strings etc. to bring out some creativity.

1204333,0,t1_ci53kr4,Ibanez Jackson ESP and similar companies make guitars for metal players who need to shred so the action should be low on all models. Strats can also have low action and can be made to shred. Take Yngwie Malmsteen as he goes one step further to use a guitar with a scalloped fretboard the frets are scooped rather than flat. LPS I owned a cheap model and it also had low action on it. Any guitar can be set up properly to ease the playing. Those companies I mentioned in the beginning Ibaniz Jackson... are made specifically for the easiest playing experience. I prefer Gibsons and Fenders to those companies though.

1802305,0,t3_2f60kp,Look very closely at your picking technique.  To go faster you may have to generate the picking motion from other muscles.  The picking motion can come from several places i.e. rotation at the elbow rotation of the wrist pronationsupination of the forearm or moving the fingers that hold the pick.  Research all of these different sources of picking motion try them and find what works for you at the speed you are targeting.  Its very important to find the technique that works for that speed.  For some people different speed  different technique.For your fretting hand I dont have a lot of advice except practice build up the coordination.  Also dont hold your fingers too far from the fret board.  What I mean is when you release a note that is remove a finger from the fret board make sure youre not lifting it up too high.Overall to play fast you have to learn to minimize the amount of energy youre expending for each note for both the picking hand and the fretting hand.  Hands have a maximum amount of energy they can put out.  You can increase that amount of energy with practice but for everybody there is a ceiling.Also check out this book  The Inner Game of Music  It will help you with execution.  If youve been playing this long the hangups could be mental that is what your mindset is when youre playing.  This book can help you find the right mindset.,guitarlessons,ck6bzwx,3,t5_2r8ca
1817965,0,t3_2fdmy2,So while it may not qualify as something you practice in the same way you practice scales it sounds like you want to understand the music in order to improve yourself which means you should look into theory.Learn scales and shapes learn chord construction and how different chords relate and then go back to those tabs youve been imitating and apply it. All of a sudden instead of just playing along you will see what the artist is doing e.g. playing an arpeggio of this chord using this scale on this key for a certain sound using a certain type of chord to lead to anotherActually learning how music ticks is a mix of an academic approach with an aesthetic one learn how it works and use that to learn how it sounds at the same time. Then you will be able to replicate certain soundseffectsfeelings on command within your own music. Create a musical toolbox full of different tricks and ideas to draw from in your playing.As part of this the comment on doing something you suck at until you dont suck anymore is relevant. Technique is essential to unlocking new tools for the toolbox. Good luck learning new passages or licks if you cant do a pulloff right? Some people encourage spending so much practice time on technique. I think this is slightly misguided but not altogether wrong practice technique but never forget why you are doing it to play music. Find songs that have licks that require a skill you lack and use that as a practice piece that way you are learning a song and refining a skill at the same time.Finally be consistent and focused. If you play once a week you wont get anywhere. Similarly  if you play sloppily  days a week you wont get anywhere fast. Practice doesnt make perfect. Practice makes permanent so make sure that the habits youre creating as you learn are good ones.The ultimate key Ive found to consistency is fun. I play music to enjoy it. If Im bangimg my head against the wall because I just cant stand this tremolo picking exercise I probably wont keep doing it. So rather than stop practicing entirely Ill take a break and come back to it later.I hope this helps and enjoy the ride.P.S. One last thing for help figuring out exactly what techniques to learnpractice  simply examine your favorite artists and try to figure out what you like about their sound and practice that.,guitarlessons,ck88ymc,4,t5_2r8ca

3520729,0,t1_cpta35g,Euronomus can you point me to a postrock song that uses tremolo picking? Im genuinely curious. Because I am not hearing it in any postrock song Ive listened to. Alternate picking is used for speed and I dont hear postrock songs with speedy guitar licks. Postrock has its roots more in mathrock alternative postpunk ambient noiserock etc.   These genres are also not know for tremolo picking. I suppose there might be a slight influence from progrock where tremolo picking is used frequently.

3702708,0,t3_32shx1,The source of the movement in your armhandfingers is also going to impact this contact problem. Are we talking about strumming here?Consider that the movement of the pick can come from the elbow the wrist rotation of the forearm or even the fingers. The most consistent movement will be from the elbow. Its the largest muscle group and will offer you a nice wide arc but its also the one that offers the least control. Try isolating each of the movements I listed and practicing them that way. But then DONT THINK ABOUT IT later when you go on to other things.With a heavier pick youll need to loosen your grip a bit so that youre not displacing the strings to the extent that your tone suffers. Note that if you are using too much forearm rotation as your source of movement then youre creating the wrong kind of contact arc against the strings that will favor the inner strings too much.,guitarlessons,cqec0gr,2,t5_2r8ca

3784116,0,t3_33jozw,Woooah slow down there! Youre trying to do way too much too fast! First lets look at your chord changes. The only thing that affects how fast you can change chord is your freethand which I will assume is your left. Practice changing chord without strumming so you are not using your right hand at all. This will allow your brain to focus  on the chord change. Another exercise you can do is again only use your left hand and change chord one finger at a time works for most but not all chords. This exercise allows you to bee  sure where every finger is going for every chord change... which if youve only been playing a week you are probably a little ropey on Next your strumming. This isnt due to your strumming ability as much as it is your sense of time. Get a slow metronome or click and strum on each click bpm or so. Write out some different rhythms and practice them to a click and youll develop a sense of time very quickly.,guitarlessons,cqnm9qg,2,t5_2r8ca
3815930,0,t3_33zuns,It is only through great pain and suffering that one can attain true greatness.There are a couple of things you can try. First is the hand washing. If its permissible at your job use hand sanitizer instead of soap and water. Alcohol based hand sanitizers are actually more effective than soap. But the big advantage is that they dont dry your skin out as much as soaps do by leaving more moisture than soap and water diop in the epidermis layer of the skin.The next thing you can try is using something like Bag Balm for when you get chapping skin drying out and open wounds. It will help better than hand lotions at aiding in healing cracked and irritated skin. Its cheap about  for oz. You can get it off Amazon or most drug stores carry it.Do not play when you have open wounds. Thats just dumb. Youre not going to lose anything taking a few days off or even two weeks off. Whatever it takes for you to get your first set of callouses going. If you keep tearingup your fingers theyre never going to develop.A good rule of thumb if your fingers really start hurting is to play about another  maybe  minutes and then pack it in.Put new strings on. Maybe even a lighter set than youre using. Try . gauge. And make sure your guitar is setup for a reasonably low action.,guitarlessons,cqr8w3k,1,t5_2r8ca

I can do it now but it was just through a couple of years of working at it.  That said when Im jamming with oldtime guitarists no one but me plays the F barre in that situation.  Most just leave the ring finger and index fingers where they on the A and B strings and then bring the pinky down on rd fret of the D string F and shift the middle finger down to the nd fret of the G string A.   Then they play just the D G B and E strings.  Half the time I think they play Fmaj instead of F since I dont think they bother to bar the high E string.

7704463,0,t3_4kuclt,I went through a very similar path in learning guitar. Knew a bunch of songs chords technique was decent but theory was essentially nonexistent.As uavecfrites mentioned learning the pentatonic patterns is a great start. Major and minor are the same pattern the positioning essentially decides which you are playing.You can go about this two ways imo learn the  note pattern and learn to move it around. Or learn the full patterns  of them shown hereEither way something that will really help with this is learning the notes of the fretboard and some tricks to help you navigate it e.g. If youre fretting a note on the low E string say rd fret  note is G move two frets up th fret and two strings up the D string and thats the same note. You can restart your pentatonic pattern from here.Once youve got the pentatonic down you can do the same with majorminor scale patterns. You can also add the blue note and youve got the blues scale pentatonic with an additional note.Something else Ive found very helpful because I knew a lot of chords is how to make different voicings of them via CAGED. Essentially you take the open chord forms of each of those chords CAGED and move them up and down the fretboard. You can then play these as partial chords or alternate voicings and combine them with the scale patterns from above.,guitarlessons,d3hy2kj,2,t5_2r8ca

8816758,0,t3_50g417,Good article. I started about a year ago and as soon as I learned GCD chords I started learning complete songs and singing along.I am not a trained singer but I play because I want to hear music coming out from inside me. So playing complete songs was always my top priority. Once I learn the song in full I play it over and over and over and it starts to sound acceptable after a while.

9175333,0,t1_d8eclhs,Its not exactly the same thing however. The Em arpeggio has E but the Gmaj does not. Using an arpeggio without the root note in it sounds cool. Its a common approach in jazz to use different types of arpeggios from different keys over chords and I come from a jazz background. For example you can play G A C D B F major triads over an E minor chord. So looking at it from a perspective of triadsarpeggios from a different key makes it easier in my opinion. ,guitarlessons,d8f1hcj,1,t5_2r8ca

9627846,0,t3_5cw1oa,So... investing in picks is a kinda silly statement. They are very cheap. If you are buying expensive picks you are doing it wrong. Dont buy into marketing hype. That being said what kinda music do oyu want to play? I know some people who swear by picks. If you are going to be playing with other people knowing how to play with a pick is a must because you wont be loud enough otherwise. Picks make you louder on acoustic. I dont see much of a need for them with an electric.,guitarlessons,d9ztvx4,9,t5_2r8ca
9842686,0,t1_daqe8un,Its a  chord if its a dominant chord  if the bth scale degree is in the chord. If its just a D chord without the bth in this case a C and you add a nd scale degree in this case an E its a  chord. If the bth and the nd are in the chord its a  chord. ,guitarlessons,daqiwux,0,t5_2r8ca

9952225,0,t3_5hst2q,play with a metronome and start slow arent wrong but they often piss the point.Many most? players even intermediate and advanced players actually have pretty weak time and pocket. You need to be able to articulate the part at high tempo with a good sense of pocket. Without good groove the part doesnt lock in and it makes it easier to drop tempo or tense your hands regardless of how well your right hand technique is.Can you sing it with your mouth or tap it with your hands on your knees? If you can articulate the part as a drum rhythm with your body you have a decent chance of being able to lock it in with your right hand. If more of us had a drum pad and sticks and maybe a shaker or two wed all have better time and play faster more exciting parts. Learning to play a few grooves on a drumkit may improve your guitar playing speed more than any other advice here believe it or not.source teach a full schedule and have helped many people increase their right hand speed big time.tldr  most speed issues are actually groove issues. Fix your sense of meter before you start going OCD about your right hand technique or practice schedule.,guitarlessons,db4stwp,1,t5_2r8ca

10357665,0,t1_dci2c8q,Because it takes away the consistency of doing it all with one type of pickslant. To do it with that updown on the b youd need to switch to an upward pickslant to get to the b doing the economy sweep thingy.  The thing you really want to practice on this lick is downward pickslanting and moving position between two strings. Practice it slowly with all downup and make sure your pick is slanted so that when you do an upstroke you pick rises above the plane of the strings.   Also when you do a downstroke on that b string let you pick fall onto the e string but not pick the e string. Youre using the e string to stop the downstroke you did on the b string and save a bit of energy.    Also your downward pickslant should be such that after you do a downstroke on the b string your pick is so downwardly angled that the tip is not too far from the b string when the upper body of your pick is stopped by the high e string.  With this proximity you can get some serious tremelo picking going.,guitarlessons,dci3oeh,1,t5_2r8ca

10512087,0,t3_5qin3u,I guess if youd like to post some clips as a comment here I can listen. Im no expert but Ive been playing for  years now and depending on what youre asking for I might be able to help.

10967707,0,t1_deb45oc,gt  I guess it depends on what kind of guitarist you are.What would you call a guitarist person who likes to play the songs mainly Slash songs that they like?gtBut if you remove a string then Ill just play what I want differently.I think this was the last song I learned about two years ago or so. In your case which is typical? you would play what you want differently if a string broke but I were playing the this part of the song when Slash is going down the neck and the high E broke Im wondering how I would be able to move to a different position and have the rest of the notes remain pretty similar. The part after the solo is the same as the verse and the entire section until the chorus uses  strings not low E. Assuming Im playing it correctly the prechorus high E notes are G A and C so when the string breaks I would need to play those notes elsewhere within the general area of the rest of the notes otherwise having to move all the other notes instead of just those three while keeping everything else going off the top of my head? If Im playing the song and at the above point of the video the high E breaks it seems like I would have to be doing this when normally my brain works like this when it comes to music.,guitarlessons,deb8pe4,1,t5_2r8ca
10969801,0,t1_deb77fn,Yeah but its not like im doing math. Its more like im singing  and it comes out my hands not my mouth. I dont have to think about it anymore. I probably couldnt play the solo perfectly note for note if the E string snapped on me presuming the solo needs it but I could improvise my way out of the mess and make it work sure. Thats what stevie ray is doing on that famous clip. His solos are  improv anyway so it makes it easier to just improv in another position and get through it. It comes from knowing that feetboard inside out left right and upside down.  ,guitarlessons,debgh9v,1,t5_2r8ca
