7339448,0,t1_d19ptfu,gt Always clear the browsing cache even if youre sure that wont fix the problem.Overall good advice but I feel like I should add to be careful here.  Always check with the customer before clearing their cache.  Some people have zero clue about their previouslystored password and youll turn into the person that deleted her passwords.  And if they know their passwords they probably dont remember their usernames for that random website they only go to once a week that you deleted without asking.  So just doublecheck.  Let them know it will delete their usernames and passwords.  And their history.,helpdesk,d2cg190,1,t5_2qhbt
