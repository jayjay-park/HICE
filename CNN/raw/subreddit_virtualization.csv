4403984,0,t1_csm18d8,Emulation is usually slower than hardware but not always. If youre emulating a device with a slow controller on your CPU the CPU may be faster. This is why cheap hardware RAID  controllers with XOR engines that run at a few hundred MHz are slower than software RAID. Having a CPU emulate itself in software used to be uniformly slow but applying JIT optimization techniques can sometimes result in even faster execution especially if the guest is running poorly optimized code. Hypervisors generally dont try to mess with that but its often necessary for privileged instructions. Due to one such instruction Windows XP runs faster in VMware if you have enough CPUs.,virtualization,csm2b5e,1,t5_2qh29

5926446,0,t3_3wikcr,I have worked with a lot of clients using Tegile. I dont have performance numbers to compare but they all seem to like them and they do hold up under VDI workloads. If you are just virtualizing back end servers then it should be perfect. Pure storage is also excellent and has a more mature product than EMCs XtremIO. I have also seen all SSD Netapp SANs doing really well. If anything the Netapp might have the better backup and snapshot tools. Nutanix is pretty good but I would stay away from them if you are using vSphere. VMwares NFS implantation is horrible and will add a lot of unnecessary IO to the storage.Whatever you do end up with I would suggest evaluating the control interface. Make sure it can really show you where performance bottlenecks are. I have seen too many consoles that just give you one giant overall IOps chart that really doesnt tell you anything when the servers are running slow and you have angry clients and managers breathing down your neck.,virtualization,cxwhl6l,1,t5_2qh29

Also I cant help but notice that the users seem to want to not se that error but are u willing to put in tickets or submit emails? Maybe they dont want it that badly?

7843074,0,t1_d3skfwz,I think you got confused with how this works. Let me alleviate your concerns You install an app called a hypervisor like Virtual Box or VMware Fusion or Parallels. What this does is allow you to install entire computers virtually called VM virtual machine.Your iMacs OS X is aware of nothing because a VM is totally encapsulated in the hypervisor. OS X doesnt know that this program runs VMs this other runs games and this other runs websites... well it does but it doesnt care it doesnt mess up anything especially on OS X which is great at isolating apps from each other and from the wider system.So dont worry about that. The whole point of virtualization is to have all things running simultaneously to avoid rebooting. otherwise just install OS X ML on your second hard drive directly boot into it and forget about virtualization entirely. Within the hypervisor youll have the chance to decide where exactly you want the VM to be stored. Thats where youll tell it to use your external totally blank drive formatted use Disk Utility make it normal OS X partition. The VM will run from there. Use an SSD to make it snappy with Thunderbolt it will work pretty fine but I think USB  would do too. Its like telling iTunes to store your media files on another drive that simple.Any day you can uninstall the hypervisor and itll be like nothing ever happened for your OS X. Just like any other app. ,virtualization,d3xmoww,1,t5_2qh29

9443981,0,t3_5a1lmh,well xp runs great on MB of ram and windows  after all the updates uses like mb  bit or MB  of ram.If its just a test system Id say go XP and keep it off the internet plus you can easily find keys for it online. If you want it to be on the internet using it fairly often then  go for windows  you can usually just get keys off of the bottom of old laptops,virtualization,d9d3b85,1,t5_2qh29
