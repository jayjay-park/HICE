2935765,0,t1_co16xbp,The reason I wondered that is because those silver paints actually have coloured reflective powder stuff in them. I think that might be the reason he looks a bit sparkly. Youll get better results if you actually use a darker silver paint  some black then wash. However I think youd get a great pop effect with some really stark highlighting here.Also do you make your own wash or use nuln oil? ,MiddleEarthMiniatures,co1t4tk,1,t5_2z3qn
