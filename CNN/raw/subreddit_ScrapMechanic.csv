I noticed that big wheels create way more power than small wheels which makes little to no sense because the engine connected should dictate that surely?In general they need to fix that wheels shouldnt have fake physics values.,ScrapMechanic,cz9x02p,1,t5_37mu7

7970260,0,t1_d43dh69,Quicktip youll see in my submission I do something similar to what you did but instead of attaching it to the ground I made a huge heavy platform to weigh down the forces at work.  This let me use the lift to weld together my creation for more stability and power.    Alternatively you can tie a knot similar to how suspension forks were done before the weld tool was released. You can have it attached to the ground then create a loop on one side and your string from your other side and create a knot that doesnt allow the string to escape the loop like intersecting loops.    Also something I learned during this challenge the importance of a counterweight!  You might have been able to get it spinning faster for more distance if you had a weight on the other side to keep it on the bearing.    Nice field goal xD its gooood!  Good luck in the contest!

8212935,0,t3_4rufsv,Technically speaking it is not a neural network because learning mechanism is not implemented. But instead I added feedback link which is responsible for some of learning mechanics.Each neuron consists of  bearings and  controllers. More than  neurons causes massive framerate drop. Thats why there is only  of them.  neuron recognizes  characterpattern so this machine can recognize only  characters at a time. But if there was no lag it could be easily expanded.Since there is no learning mechanism except for setting weights manually I added a feedback layer consisting of  neuron. Small neuron in the feedback layer activates only if there is more than one activated neuron in the first layer. If so it sends to neuron inputs in the first layer a signal which gradually decreases weighted sum of each neuron. It will continue until only one activated neuron in the first layer is left.,ScrapMechanic,d5466fe,3,t5_37mu7
