Youd normally need special software tools just to set or clear the IMEI number.If a reboot doesnt fix it Id look into getting it repaired under warranty if possible.You could maybe try to flash a different version of the radio firmware in hopes that will fix it but Im not optimistic about that.Option B would be to buy a N with a busted screen and change out the main logic board that has the modem on it.,nexus4,cegbg94,18,t5_2v9bv

If the phone doesnt turn on at all might not be worth it to fix.Alternative If you pay your phone bill with a Wells Fargo credit card or if you bought your phone with a Chase credit card there is a chance that they might replace your phone for you.Wells Fargo provides free phone insurance if you pay your bill with their credit card. I dropped my N and it broke so they sent me a check for  for my S. They pay for your new phone not the price of your old phone. They cover up to  minus a  deductible. I only had to pay  out of pocket for the S.Chase credit cards give extended warranty and accidental protection for a limited time. Not sure if all cards do this but I know my Chase Amazon Visa does. It applies to all purchases not just those on Amazon. Couldnt find the link for this they sent the information to me with my credit card.Source Wells Fargo,nexus4,chqgjm6,8,t5_2v9bv

5247969,0,t1_cvih8jn,I switched to the ZC around  months ago an upgrade on all counts compared to the N its pretty much the only highend compact phone around.  The battery life has definitely lived up to expectations the camera is above averagebut still hit and miss at timesthe ZC at its worst is still better than the N at its best.I might wait to see what the new N and ZC have to offer at this point though.,nexus4,cvikhyk,3,t5_2v9bv

But between the shitty performance and the battery burn this phone often fails me when I need it the most.Luckily I dont travel too often so I dont get affected as much.

A year or so ago my N got softbricked from a failed kernel flash and nothing worked to get a rom back on it. similar to your situation. You may be able to find a cellphone shop in your area that has the tools to perform a jtag. Basically thats taking the phone apart connecting to the storage inside directly and loading the factory software just like they did when they built it.I got a small independent shop around me to do it for like . But i dont know if you have that option around you or how much theyd charge. You have to decide how much you value the N in . especially considering it may not work. My guy only charged if it worked so no risk for me.Good luck. Let me know if you get it running. Now im curious.,nexus4,cypsvdw,1,t5_2v9bv
