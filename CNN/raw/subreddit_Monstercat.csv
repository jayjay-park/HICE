162744,0,t1_cewy6hn,If there was a higher influx of trap I think it would be appropriate. But the supply just doesnt seem to be there. The reason they added the last two genres is because people were making them frequently especially Glitch HopMoombahOther  BPM stuff. But with trap we dont really get it often. I mean its there but I just dont see the quantity being high enough atm.I personally think that in time the young EDM fans will catch on to it. Let an idiot be an idiot until they figure it out which will happen eventually so there isnt really a need to differentiate the two styles of Dubstep.I think Moombah could work out but it also doesnt seem too necessary as thats why its called Glitch Hop BPM which Moombah usually stands at. That is just my opinion though. Maybe a few other members here will add their two cents.,Monstercat,cewywej,5,t5_2se72

1036664,0,t3_25xpc2,Honestly Drink UP IMO was really disappointing. I was looking forward to a kickass jazzy Back and Forthesque Glitch Hop track from TTC. What I got instead was some saxwhich admittedly was pretty nice cheesy vox and a seriously underwhelming drop.Excellent Choice was also pretty disappointing I thought it would be really good because the previous SW tracks were really good but it just sounded like he used sounds from his Rain remix and Pizza PlanetSKW and kinda made something out of it.,Monstercat,chm4gs8,1,t5_2se72

The fact we only officially formed on Wednesday helps put things into perspective. So its still early days and is more of a small hobby thing than anything else.

1996039,0,t3_2hjf01,I have no idea how to contribute other than saying I like it a lot. Its like Future Bass and DnB. Technically Trap amp Bass actuallyBut yeah you have a lot of drawn out parts. The part from about  or so is just too drawn out and gets boring. The whole spectrum is pretty boring itself. If you could make it more dynamic with more sounds and not as drawn out it would sound better. Still really good if you are new to producing and you seem to be so props to ya Dubz EDIT I guess I should say a bit more. The whole thing seems to be split up. Yes im screenshotting from paint so fuck you The parts split off are all the same and thats where you need to fix it . It sounds good but repeated so much. In the part I was talking about earlier I skipped through  or  times and the same piano key was played. It needs to be changed and generally the bars are all in one spot low or high or middle but never really changing. You need to fix that because it sounds good but its not dynamic at all which is pretty hard to listen to for me.,Monstercat,cktq1k5,1,t5_2se72

2458599,0,t1_cmfgf2q,Ill keep this short cos Im tired but the first  secs were PERFECT. I couldnt have come up with a better intro. But for the love of god get rid of that cheap supersaw that comes in after  secs. I personally wud slowly transisition the gated synth into a huge supersaw if it was my track. Layer  together to get a really rich sound.The main problem I have is the intro and drop dont match. The intro would be perfect for a progressiveliquidseven lionssaid the skyesque dubstep song. The drop has a completely different attitude to the intro so imo u shud split the two songs up into a heavier drop based song and a liquidish intro song. The  secs between  and  wud be a perfect style for the intro style song if u want a basis for it. Thats just my opinion anyway so u cud completely ignore it or it cud give u some ideas for the rest of the song. Anyway Id love to hear the finished song ,Monstercat,cmfl22b,1,t5_2se72

2485371,0,t1_cmiyvwd,Undr.Wrld to the rescue. more days until scribble!     I literally could not be more excited for a single day than this release day not to mention the th is also my st birthday! Seeing people speculate and get excited about Scribble is literally the most surreal experience of my entire life. I have been producing for a while now but Scribble was the first true piece of music that came purely from me. It was ...the first thing I ever created that I am truly proud to call my own. Only a few people know this but the Puppet project was no accident. I actually started Scribble almost exactly a year ago and every day since that point I have been preparing for this moment. Everything you are going to see and hear for the next few months is a part of my artistic vision and and has been a labor of love. I am my own art director. Every photo album art and video especially the videos I have a hand in creating. I have been a musician for  years of my life but Puppet is what I consider my true contribution to this world. While I produce dance music first and foremost the music I am creating as Puppet is also a true expression of my being and is meant to let you hear the world the way I hear it. With every song I try to break the mold and insert my emotions in a way you may have never heard before. It has been a challenge but a challenge worthy of the reward. I could not be more thankful to Monstercat for having faith in my artistic vision and giving me the chance to prove myself and share my music with you all. Scribble is not the only thing you have to be excited for lets just say I think the cat and I are gonna become good friends for a while To those of you who are knowledgable about MC there is a bit of a spoiler hidden somewhere on their site right now.Im keeping secrets See More,Monstercat,cmiz5pz,8,t5_2se72

2642267,0,t1_cn3gafs,gt Can you please just shut up about genres for one single moment?Sure.gt You arent the genre overlord. You dont know every single genre ever.U wotgt Heck youve even admitted that youre not good at genres like trap and future bass! So obviously youve got your own labelling flaws.Yeah. Not good yet. I m . Im still learning.gt How about you look back and see what else you have mislabelled because I guarantee this Youre not perfect with genres.I dont claim to be.gt Youre far from it.Not really. Im pretty damn good.gt Sure youre better than me at some genres i.e. future house vs deep house but trust me I know some stuff.If you admit that Im better at that then why were you so stubborn claiming that no this track would be deep hau a while ago?gt First off you nitpick the tiniest details. This is really what you sound like to somegt There wasnt a beat right there... ITS BIG ROOM! Youre wrong if you think otherwise! WRONG!When do I sound like this? The lack of one beat in one measure would never define a genre. Saying things like this makes you look ridiculous.gt That leads me to my second point... youre hypocritical in your genres. You usually use the modern definitions of genres such as for electro house complextro future house and the like. Meanwhile you use the classicalno longer correct definition for progressive house and big room.No. Please stop. I think youre confusing modern with popular and its completely wrong. Any modern electro house future house complextro tracks would be considered such if they were made in the respective genres early days. gt Sure big room might have meant what people call progressive house today... a few years ago. But it doesnt mean that now!Terms change and I cant deny that. The correctness of those is what really matters.gt Saying that one should use the classical definition even though its not correct anymore is like saying that one should go about their day nude because the first people were nude. It just doesnt make sense.And yet there are nudists who have these exact beliefs.gt If youre going to define genres by modern definitions... good! Thats what you should be defining them by! If youre going to be defining genres by classical definitions... okay I guess but its kinda outofdate. But you cant do both.Theres some sort of logical fallacy here but I dont know what.gt By the way if you define trance by modern definitions it should be apparent that Crossroad is trance. If you define trance by classical definitions it should be apparent that Messiah is trance. It cant be that both are wrong.Neither Crossroad nor Messiah can be considered trance by any definition of trance. Saying things like this makes you look dumb or just uneducated about trance music.gt Anyway allinall I think youd be a bit better off here if you stuck to modern definitions... and even better try to figure out why they labelled it that way rather than why it isnt that genre. Okay? Im really wanting to help you become less of a nuisance to many people.I know why people label it as such thats why its important to figure out whether its correct or not.If you want to help me be less of a nuisance try to fix my personality not completely fuck up meanings of genres.,Monstercat,cn3h68e,3,t5_2se72

2841695,0,t3_2snctn,Greetings EP Uploads here.andyoubetterbereadingthiswithCaveJohnsonsvoiceThe thumbnails Monstercat uses are made by putting a layer with the genre square and some text in the project file and hiding the text and the square we actually see on the video. This way they can look for a precise frame where a lot of activity is found commonly at the drop. However they have some kind of external template they used for the first videos uploaded in the new layout. Lets keep in mind Best of House is a HUGE video and im sure they didnt look for the precise frame and just decided to use the external template.There is an error with the thumbnail too in Insanlik  Feel Alive Direct Remix in which the genre square uses a darker purple colour. ,Monstercat,cnr3jt7,6,t5_2se72

As he is walking he experiences flashbacks of all the good times he and his exgirlfriend had together.  During the second drop however he flashbacks to the moment when he and his girlfriend broke up.  In the final chorus he finds the girl standing behind him and he and the girl have fun together on the beach.

I looked into the Monstercat genre categories before listening to much of their songs back when these genres were Youtube Shows. And even before then I listen to the Party All Night Mix EP by DJ Snow which mightve been what got me learning about EDM genres in the first place.I was also brought into his label by DJ Snows Hellberg Mix.

A circlejerk is where everyone agrees with each other and ignores any opposing viewpoints even if well argued just because they all agree and close themselves into an echo chamber. This is just some people finding it funny to reference the single word in the song as the shortest lyrics ever. uAllcolyle even agreed with you that its a vocal sample not a lyric. Your downvotes arent warranted but ruining the joke even if you personally dont find it funny isnt going to sit well with any group of people.

I got stuck on them for a while then I watched a Minecraft video with a Monstercat song in it. I jumped on their channel and fell in love. My first song was Reasons iirc and I also remember in my middle school computer class that I went on the Monstercat bandcamp site and streamed the music really loud in my headphones while doing other shit. I always chose   Solace as the album I listen to because the name of the youtuber who got me into EDMK was similar to the album name. Just pitching that in there ,Monstercat,cs06q9z,2,t5_2se72

4368297,0,t3_3b1aed,Holy I ranted and this turned out huge. i do that sometimes sorry but bear with me lolHey man! First of all Im hearing really nice things. Not only were your drums programmed well overall I liked your use of ghost snares and hats at the drops. Also you had really nice transitions like how you used LFO on the risers before  then used a big cymbal crash before you went into the drop. Sounds like you understand structure and form of a song well.So the first thing I noticed was the strange harmonies. Now this is music. If people on here tell you doesnt sound sidechained enough or doesnt sound EQd you should try putting them aside for a moment and think about harmonies and melodies. electricitys only been around for about a century and EQs have probably been around for only half that time but musics existed for hundreds and hundreds of years So about the harmonies yeah I understand this song is called Polygons and you probably themed it after that and used diminishedsounding harmonies but I think you should start on some more orthodox chords like a C Dominant Seventh chordC E G Bb or fresh sounding ones like a C major seventh chord C E G B. Inversions are also pretty cool I dont know everything about music theory yet but Im looking into triad and chord inversions like the ones here gt  Also if you just listen to music all the time all kinds of music especially genres like Jazz music with cool progressions and improvisation melodies will start to come to your head a lot easier!Okay now that parts out of the way we should probably look to more modern things like EQing. i cant stop talking can i lolSo people said your drums sound drowned and theyre probably right. So starting off with the snare one thing about your snare is that it has lots and lots of long high sizzle but not enough tone or the meaty fleshy part at around hz. You should either get a punchier more concise sample with a shorter sizzle most free DnB snare samples are compressed to oblivion and dont need much further processing or boost your snare at hz. Also one nice trick to making a snare punch through a track is using parallel compression. You can use a return track for this but if your compressor has a wetdry knob you can do it with no return track. Okay first pop a compressor onto your snare and leave the wetdry at . Then crank the ratio up to about  and set the attack and release on minimum. If you decrease the threshold youll probably notice that the decaysizzle gets loud and the cracktransient of the snare gets really quiet. Now slowly lower the wet dry to  and youll notice that the unaltered snare sound with the loud crack or transient gets mixed with the megacompressed sizzly louddecay sound and this helps punch a good snare sample better into the mix! Now remember that if you have snare samples the person who made them might have already done this so be wary. Some really REALLY good free snare samples are the Crispydinner samples look them up youll probably find them pretty fast. Your kick also sounds pretty soft. People go all out when giving advice concerning eqing compressing etc. about drums but more than half the time its just an underpar sample. Youre kick sample is pretty thumpy and quiet and doesnt have the aggressive sound that others might have.  You want to make sure the kick and snare are peaking at the highest points in the mix at around  db and make sure the other synths are sidechained or cut at certain frequencies to make way for the drums. If you lack a sample you can just take a generic house or electro kick sample dont use them as they are for DnB and pitch them up to about Hz where DnB kicks live. holy shit that turned out long. now Im not that good at producing dont ask for my soundcloud I havent posted anything yet P but im just passing on the stuff i learned from around the internet and other pros you can find a lot of the stuff at redmproduction also if youre in need search samples into the search bar there and youll get a lot hope I helped!,Monstercat,csi1iu3,3,t5_2se72

5134013,0,t3_3l98np,Definitely one of the better usermade tracks Ive heard on the sub. Could use a few short harsh dynamic basses during the end of each bar in both drops just to move along the track a bit more and provide a bit more edge to the song since thats the vibe Im getting from it something like the basses in this track but a lot shorter with some filtering as well. You coould also slightly vary the synth stab throughout the track maybe use different wavetables with the same filtervolume modulations just to provide more variety. The main lead synth in the intro and bridge sounds a bit muddy imo just a little bit of EQ and lowering the volume of it just a bit will fix that up. Other than that excellent effort might want to try submitting to this like smaller labels like MA Free or Argofox for additonal exposure,Monstercat,cv4u918,1,t5_2se72

5470917,0,t3_3q081y,Personal choicesFAVORITE. Varien  Very unique style. A lot of his songs are hit or miss with me but the ones that hit are amazing. . Noisestorm  I love a lot of his songs not much to say here.... Pixl  Sugar Rush is actually my favorite song and I love almost all his other songs too.. Stephen Walking  The artist that I discovered Monstercat through. The reason the beard isnt higher on my list is because I dislike a lot of his newer songs however his older songs are simply amazing. Especially his older and pre Monstercat songs. . Rouge  Rouge has always been one of my favorite artist. His songs never get old and he is one of the only MC artist whose made a trap song I actually like. .Tristam  Great producer singer and songwriter. While I do think his newer songs havent been as good his old songs are unforgettable.. Haywyre  Very unique style that sounds great. Every single Haywyre song is a maser piece and Two Fold is one of the best albums Ive heard.. Pegboard Nerds   These  can take any genre and make it amazing Personally I think their heavy stuff is the best but I like  their lighter stuff such as Pink Cloud too.. Muzzy  Pure opinion. I just love his  DNB style and think hes a great musician. Im always excited when I see a Muzzy song Is out next..Tut Tut Child  Not a single TTC song released on Monstercat I dont like. Hes my favorite artist on the label simply because I think his songs sound the best.LEAST FAVORITE  keep in mind I dont think any of these people are bad producers Their music just isnt for me and all of this is an opinion so keep that in mind.. Razihel  Not too long ago I had him as my th or th favorite but then he started making this awful bounce music acting like a dick to his fans and to top it all off he removed all his old songs from his soundcloud. If he stops all this bullshit than hes off this list.. Slips amp Slurs  No real dislike just they only have one song on the lable and I didnt like that song. Im actually struggling to come up with artist I dont like so thats good.. Direct  I just dont like most of his music There are several Direct songs I like. I do not think he is a bad producer in anyway his music just isnt for me.. Hyper Potions  I just dont like any of their songs once again their music is not my type. Not to mention Anime Bae is now in my library so thanks for the title. . Karma Fields  Not my type. Starting to see a pattern? I dont like any of their songs. Plus they were ridiculously over hyped in my opinion.,Monstercat,cwaylyi,2,t5_2se72

Unfortunately my living situation makes it pretty much impossible to find stuff to do outside of going on the internet. Its just all changed so much for me. I grew up living close to my friends where it was always sunny so I had room to grow. Im a Senior next year and Im miles from my schools and friends in a place where it rains . My main mental wall right now is I feel like Ive lived about as full of a life as I ever will. I honestly dont see much beyond this point. ,Monstercat,cwyrm2h,3,t5_2se72

Riffstation and Chordify let you input links from YouTube and Soundcloud along with other sites that I cant remember ATM and translate the songs into chords. It will then play the song and show you what chords to play so you can follow along. In my experience Riffstation is more accurate than Chordify but Chordify lets you see the entire song while its playing whereas Riffstation uses a scrolling bar beneath a video player to show you what chord to play.,Monstercat,cyj44np,2,t5_2se72

6642013,0,t3_46k942,Firstly thanks to every single one of you for your responses! I read quite a lot of them through trying to understand what you think and what you dont think what you agree with and what you dont. Sparking a discussion between people exchanging opinions listening to eachother understanding eachother comprehending eachother.The overall consensus seems te be that the YouTube community should not be taken seriously. Firstly it seems that the community is of a younger age which makes the community look childish and the comments might be cringy. Secondly Monstercat has grown in popularity a lot over the years thus gaining more fans too. Those fans might like Monstercat for their special artists as I would call them artists who define the label and have made tracks which are popular Pegboard Nerds and Tristam are named. Mostly these artists produce tracks with genres outisde the mainstream EDMscene for example tracks which are on the radio etc. Other artists with even more unique content might not be as popular as they go outside these borders which other popular artists have shaped over the years on the label. Karma Fields is an example of the latter.It has also been said that the uniqueness of Karma Fields actually belongs to the label as much or even more than others because of their uniqueness. The label has shaped over the years bringing new genres and artists with different styles. Karma Fields is one of them too Putting their stamp on the label showing that they add their thing to the label the thing that makes listeners enjoy their music.

6967879,0,t1_d1644s8,Most people dislike it because There are ten billion future bass releases on that album! Gaaah!I would have to disagree about this being a bad thing. Hovering back over s tracks most of the future bass tracks sound quite different to each other and to me most of them were really damn great High Tide SMSR Again so I didnt really care what genre they belonged to. Judge the songs not the genre.I really dont get why  is frowned upon because of all the future bass tracks when many fan favourite and most recent monstercat compilations albums have had an over abundance in electro. Im willing to understand the argument that you can do many things with electro. Just look at  and try to compare New Game Renzokuken and Buzzkill.

7104268,0,t3_4ctzyh,almost none of it tbh. Ive been in the game long enough that I know what I like and what I dont so I dont think in terms of label anymore. I listen to a wide range of stuff although admittedly most is stillsomewhere in the realm of EDM and for me its just if I like the song I get it and if I dont I dont. Labels are not part of the equation but usually it ends up that the amount of Monstercat music is very small compared to the stuff outside of the label even though I still follow the label actively and enjoy a fair amount of the content especially recently. edit reading these comments about how little people branch out away from the label made me really really sad. if anyone is willing to make the leap and branch out and wants recommendations on where to start please pm me and I would love to help you out.,Monstercat,d1ln3yr,3,t5_2se72

The thing about posting music for feedback is that its nonMonstercat related and it used to clutter up the sub and many people here are casual listeners so people werent getting useful feedback and it became just selfpromotion. In addition this is a official subreddit for the label and while we have to respect our community we also need to respect Monstercat since staff moved to have the feedback posting disallowed and to be honest this isnt the place for music feedback.

The best thing about it is that wonderful groovy vibe with that positive energy. Its just so bright and cool with a nice melody. Wish the melody was more dynamic but as is the way its executed it just bleeds style and brightness. This is even better than OMWU and I cant wait for more bouncy and energetic songs like this from Conro.Its nice to see Monstercat return to strong form this week after two rather bland weeks with two great songs so far. And who else can finish off a great week better than the Pegboard Nerds?

7891035,0,t3_4nb5rz,Generally a songs genre is determined by what the majority of the drops are. The problem is the drops appear to be almost evenly divided between Electro and Nu Disco. Id call it Electro just because you almost never hear a heavy Electro drop in the middle of a Nu Disco song but theres quite a few Electro and Complextro songs that incorporate some kind of funk elements. It seems to me the song is an equal cross of both genres but if I had to only pin it down to one Id call it Electro.,Monstercat,d430xk8,3,t5_2se72

7973947,0,t3_4og2fg,Oh man I didnt know that I had been waiting for a thread like this.Lets start of with something thats EDM Bot amp David Heartbreak Gianni Marino Fireworks Remix Why the Fireworks you may ask? Well give it a listen and you will find you answer. Its quite a quirky take on the big room sound.Alright. Heres one I absolutely love but I have no idea what it actually is. KLSLWSK  Fully The mixing is really shoddy but the track is quite brilliant IMO.Moving on to the more weird tracks heres A. G. Cook  HAD  I guess PC Music is kinda cheating but now its here. I really like this track for reasons I dont even know. I wouldnt be surprised if its the vocal chops and the lyrics actually but the rest of the track adds something extra to it.Staying with PC Music next up is GFOTY  Dont WannaLets Do It Theres probably not much meaning to the lyrics but the contrasting lyrics are still kind of interesting especially when represented next to each other. I also like the fact they actually use pitch entire vocal clips in the hook instead of just chopping the thing up.Coming up with a vibe similar to the PC Music collective is Onika  bffs The vocals in this track are used in such an interesting way unlike anything Ive heard before. If this track strikes your fancy then Onikas Best Friends Mix carry on in the same theme.Carrying on into something Japanese we have fu mou   feat.  Probably one of my favourites of all these tracks. The chill atmosphere is one thing but the use of white noise is absolutely phenomenal. Really unique use of something most only use for sweeps or risers.I love interesting uses of white noise so thats why Im giving you another cool use of noise. Its a  degree turn in atmosphere though Fis  DMT Usher Its kind of impressive how much power one can get out of a sub and some noise with effects.Okay enough with the noise lets try some bass music again. Heres Billain  Autonomous It may seem relatively normal right up until the drop. I cant say Im very fond of the choice but major props to Billain for having the balls to do a dnb drop completely without a kick drum.Staying in the bass spectrum but in a different corner of it heres Rob Lewis  Smoking Device The clicks running the melody leave nothing more to be said.After these two tracks you probably need something to wind down. Heres MrMilkcarton  Words Relatively normal track except for the uncommon time signature which the track completely nails. Its not a time signature one is used to from dance music at all yet the track flows so naturally like its no big deal.Were cooling further down. Enter Muta  Praise I dont have much to say here. I just like the use of the many weird elements in this track.Can we cool more down? Yes we can! Aes Dana feat. Miktek  Parenthesis Im a sucker for simple tracks that still have a lot going on. It usually shows that the artists gave themselves plenty of time to perfect all the elements in the track.Tired of the long tracks? Then lets have a break from them before we move into the final  minute long track Roses  Chipped Nails From my understanding this track is  sampling probably from the same source. Still it manages to build up a rather eerie and mysterious atmosphere.Here comes the last track Senking  Closing Eyes I guess this is ambient? Anyway I love the voice in the background rattling off numbers. It gives off a pretty dark atmosphere. I cant help but feel that its kind of a suspenseful track too. I can imagine a scene of someone sitting at a hospital or something just waiting for news that may or may not change the persons life or maybe a kind of emergency scene. Anyway the channel this is uploaded on audioreactlab is filled with very different tracks that all qualify for this thread. I couldve just filled my list with tracks from this channel but that would be no fun. The visuals are amazing and unique for each upload as well but most really should come with an epilepsy warning.And that concludes my list. If you actually gave all the tracks a listen then thank you! Took a while to throw this list together. I think I have more stuff I could add but I didnt want to break the flow of the post and its already long enough as is.,Monstercat,d4cci8r,9,t5_2se72

Like really? MC signs singles not songs a reason for such being so that artists are not limited to releasing there. Subtact coowns a label. So does Astronaut. Heck San Holo owns a label. And yes I know someone will say but astronaut doesnt release anymore. Well its not like their not trying. Owning or being part of another label means NOTHING. Artists can do whatever they want. They can submit a song to be released on ANY LABEL THEY WANT. In fact they dont even have to release on their own label. San Holo didnt even have a release on his own label until still looking. And Astronaut did cross releases. So who knows. Stop saying theyll Never release again. And sorry if it sounds like Im angry. Im just tired of seeing everyone jumping to conclusions and seeing stuff about Au and Fractal leaving everywhere that they are Mentioned just because they said their starting their own label.Edit yes I have actually been told by astronaut about why they dont release but will not share the reason without their permission Edit  Fractal Return Confirmed P,Monstercat,d65xdqh,7,t5_2se72

Just put in what you think is as beautifulinnovative as the ones you originally put in yourself. Id hate to see this just turn into everyone puts in their favorite song u know what i mean? But yea great playlist heres a few to consider and possibly add only if you feel like they fit lol. Illenium  Without You or something from Ashes Puppets Without Me is a great choice that and Vagabond Id say are his most beautifulinnovative. Just had to shout out Vagabond but Without Me is a perfect choice. Arty amp Mat Zo  Rebound Gemini  Time To Share Im glad Seven Lions is in there quite a lot actually. He stuff is all great but I really think his most beautifulinnovative songs are A Way To Say Goodbye and Coming Home. Madeon  Finale Joe Garston  Adventures in Suburbia The Eden Project  Fumes Digitalism  Mirage Part One If I think of any more Ill edit this If any Tristam is going on Id say My Friend would be the best choice.,Monstercat,d68jlf1,1,t5_2se72

Then you smash them together with what I think is called a heat press. This heats the paper so the image transfers from the paper to the shirt.

9034933,0,t3_53wvqb,Great questions! Weve spent a lot of time thinking of ways to engage with fans on Soundcloud. One thing we noticed is that as soundcloud users lifetime on the platform increases so does the clutter in peoples feeds. As a result when we post a release at AM PST someone who normally checks soundcloud in the evening or at their optimal time our uploads can often miss our fans. Therefore as a way to increase our visibility and to give fans who follow Monstercats page a chance to discover the artists page we began implementing reposts a few hours after our upload goes live. This is still in the testing phase so any feedback would be appreciated!The reason why we repost a single track playlist is to keep all of plays on one upload so our artists have a better chance of reaching the charts instead of splitting the plays between multiple uploads. Hope that clarifies a bit!,Monstercat,d7xutmr,3,t5_2se72

No. Did the girls in Krewella produce anything BEFORE the group split up? No.  Do they even know how to produce? Nope. What Krewella is now is just an average vocalist duo relying on ghost producers so they can use and squeeze out the little bit of popularity left in the name. I think it is really sad that after everything that happened that the name Krewella are still being used especially like this. Krewella is to me supposed to be an electronic music group.

10123620,0,t3_5kwj7q,The song starts at Im aware that Tristam probably based his song off an old violin piece and thats what the girl is playing but I thought it was an intereseting fact.Funny thing is I found out another similarity a few weeks ago and maybe he has even more songs based off older pieces.Also The OA is a pretty good series! If you like mistery and strange plots go check it out!      EDIT I just found out that the song is unreleased and was composed for the series and it came out like  days ago so it might have been a coincidence or the composer knows Tristams music which I really doubt tbh,Monstercat,dbr44eh,12,t5_2se72

11041981,0,t3_5x825n,I listen to a lot of Monstercat and NCS actually. I love both labels equally actually. NCS was the label that got me into EDM but I lean more into Monstercat because the music here is actually more diverse if not even more. Maybe its either that Im a DnBDrumstep and Glitch Hop kind of guy are I think NCS is a bit too linear because most of their music is House but some of their songs along DnBDrumstep and some Trap and Dubstep actually stands out for me like the ff  Wait For You  ElectroLight and Jordan Kelvin James ft. Anna Yvette Fall For Gravity  ElectroLight ft. Nathan Brumley Fall To Light  Laszlo he started out at NCS then moved to Monstercat later Dont Look Down  Laszlo as well My Heart  Different Heaven and EH!DE Beside You  Rameses B yes Rameses B from Monstercat and Soundr Miles Away  Kasger Limitless and Wontolla Highland  Kasger Stardust  T and Sugah amp NCT ft.

11054435,0,t1_dekx5am,Were not upset because theyre back and no one is turning them away from the community. We simply removed their post because they could easily as others have said do a quick Google search or look at Monstercats videos. Its pointless to have such a post on the subreddit and if anything we should be welcoming of any current returning or new members of this community. Its just unnecessary for them to make a post saying What have I missed what are some notable releases and other stuff like that.From a moderators view I try to filter out any posts I deem low quality and try to maintain peace within the community. If I see a really shitty meme getting posted Ill probably remove it. If I see songs that make you cringe least favorite artists and stuff like that Ill remove those. For the latter though Im not trying to kill the discussion or send out a fuck you to the OP Im just trying to avoid people getting offended and lashing out at others for strongly disliking something they strongly like.None of this has anything to do with how long someones been on the subreddit or how long its been since they were on the subreddit its just a matter of raising the bar and maintaining quality content on the subreddit.,Monstercat,del02bx,12,t5_2se72

11263244,0,t3_60mwuv,So much better than his recent hard dance songs not to say that I didnt still love them because I did but this is fantastic. He released a bunch of presets last year the one that caught my ears most has a very similar feel to this song.

11272807,0,t1_df880f9,Personally I havent been putting him down. I enjoy his music but PARTY and OKAY are the only songs that have stood out to me from his discography. I know hes a good artist with clean production but for a while now I havent been really enjoying his music because his recent songs have not stood out to me as much. I still somewhat like his songs but it wouldnt be an instant hit for me like OKAY was or Everything Black by Unlike Pluto.    Also you shouldnt say that we have no place to give an opinion on his music and theres not point of saying anything at all because not all of us are music producers. I dont produce music but Ive taken piano intensely for  years so I know what it means to put hard work into something. I dont think any of us wants to disrespect TM as a person and I do like his songs its just that we have varying opinions of him that arent always completely positive. ,Monstercat,df9r8g6,2,t5_2se72

11328608,0,t3_61mabh,So I finally checked out osu yesterday and theres one artist Camellia whose work is really awesome so far. Has a vibe very similar to Au and Fractals melodic hard stuff e.g. Crystallised has a feel similar to Moonland Blue or Secret Weapon. Also Singularity reminds me of their classic melodic dubstep sound and Im loving it. Im working through the Crystallised LP now will update if there are any more mention worthy tracks.  Edit Well it seems rMonstercat is no stranger to Camellia posts but my recommendation still stands ,Monstercat,dfg2uhu,1,t5_2se72
