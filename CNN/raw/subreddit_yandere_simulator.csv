I assume the great majority of volunteers wouldnt even think of doing so but I suppose its good to plan for the ... That being said I do hope Yandere Dev doesnt mention people by name if it does happen. Its one thing to say the build is being delayed because a volunteer has removed their work and quite another to start an internet witch hunt. People will be very upset at whoever delays a build understandably but we dont want to physically endanger or send a horde of flamers their way.But that being said Im still quite in favor of these donation changes as I mentioned last post.

Say you pull the fire alarm then later tell the guidance counsellor it was RivalChan but it turns out RivalChan has several alibis then you would get in trouble instead. And the severity would go up with the offence  if you injure yourself and fail to properly accuse someone then this would reflect extremely poorly on you. If you disguise yourself as RivalChan and run around with a weapon but RivalChan is amongst the witnesses this would be laughed off by everyone who sees you.In order to properly frame someone you have to stalk them and know them well enough to know when they would be alone and therefore unable to defend themselves against an accusation.

Its a problem that many people in similar situations have been forced to deal with due to the popularity of their project. YD has to find another way to work around that. The problem is whether or not YD is willing to try out the solutions and advice that were given by people that understand his dilemma. Its scary to think that he seems to think that his original plan was reasonable. He actually thinks the internet was the one being stubborn and not him. His original plan had so many flaws that many people were questioning if he understood public relations as well as he seemed to think he did. He says he thought up a new solution which Im actually happy about but I dont know... Im wary that its another one of his weird solutions like the time he thought harassing little kids who tweeted him stupid questions would eventually make every single kid stop tweeting dumb questions. ,yandere_simulator,d2ax8hd,3,t5_37nnf

Even if they dont like something like the pantie shot mechanic Yandev said that would be optional so its fine. they can do without it. But the inventory system is not optional they would be forced to contend with it. that will leave a sour taste in some peoples mouth.In regards to steam. well dont think about it with the current events mindset. think about it with a future sense. Like i said they are  bad press day away from some shit. in your regards to the other games you mentioned. they are all games that got thrown in the joke pile forgotten the day they came out. they havent been brought up yet. but thats only a matter of time. it is an election year so most news companies are busy but that changes come January. I would really hate to see yanderesim cast in a bad light especially since its not a bad game.as for the age of sexualized characters. yes them being over  makes a difference Yanchan is not over . And most of them are not looked upon highly. I dont want Yansim to be regarded as just another fetish anime game sexualizing underage girls and ripping off bigger games. its got so much more potential. ,yandere_simulator,d4n3pk9,1,t5_37nnf

This inspired me to give Senpai an admirer in the Drama Club so I could implement a similar elimination method.

10150835,0,t1_dbulgm0,gtTeenagers that have a reputation of being delinquents would be dealt with if they brought weapons to school. Not punishing them for bringing weapons to school because you believe they just want to look intimidating is not an excuse. Especially when the delinquents are in a prestigious school thats trying to get more kids to enroll in their school. Having these delinquents do whatever the hell they want because theyre not directly hurting anyone just makes the school look lazy.Thats like a police officer finding  pounds marijuana at the back of someones trunk. Then doing nothing because heshe believes the person who owns the drugs isnt going to do anything illegal with them. Oh look at these illegal drugs! Its probably for researching purposes and they probably have a permit for it too! Im not gonna question them or anythingHowever unless YandereDev is messing with me he just spoiled the reason why the delinquents are tolerated at this school. The reason he gave is completely ridiculous.Ok. That what i was talking. You are asking your self why some things are still tolersted if normally it would happen another thing yeah while you dont have an answer you will still that dont have any logic but i am sure that you sre thinking that you need an answer. You need an answer That is the intrigue that the game want to let you. And Yanderedev answer it totally maje sense. If some peopme didnt understand it THAT IS ANOTHER THING. However is a game dont try to search the realistic side... Try to search it the fun side... For example it isnt realistic that you cant summon demons or convert you in ebolachan... Just try to fun the fun side... However i am sure that all your question can be EASILY answer for Dev. But he wont give you any spoiler to you. You can still say that this is incorrect but my answer is the same.ltI dont think you understood why I referenced the tapes as an example of something that gives the player a sense of mystery.Excuse me but you are just explaining your kind of misterious perfect game. But so much people want to still know what will happen. In fact there are so much misterious side for answer... Like the questions that you made... There are an answer... Anyway... I wont repeat the same again becuase i think you already know what i wilm say you.gtNo whats important is that it comes out on the right released date like he wanted. Do you want this game out in  or ?Dev said that it will become in  just for prevent that the fans still email him. Now the game will be finish in April  yeah... Beciase now is all finishing And the kickstarter will finish the game around in  years. So in AprilJune of  will be ready... Dev have all planned... The history is great and there are a very long backhistory. He actually have olans that he can say but just for no spoil. The explications of your questions you will able to find it if you play the final game.

Girls like this do exist. Some girls are more tolerant of flirting than others. Some girls are more tolerant even of sexual harassment than others. Some girls are not more tolerant of either. Some guys also draw different lines on what they think is sexual harrasment vs flirting and there are certainly girls who still react positively to certain things.Of course thats between adults. Its entirely possible that pedophiles will subvert those interactions and Im contending that that is more likely the case than people subverting things in the game.It is not being marketed to a broader audience. As quoted before his target audience are mature adults.In response to your statement that after  or so times itd stop being funny Of course it will. Almost every form of entertainment only has the most impact the first time. And its the creators decision if they want to have it in or not.As I said before I have already conceded that if this is the only way to get currency in the game right now there should at least be other methods so as to not make this one seem forced or as overdone. But not necessarily because I think the mechanic itself is overbearing or its bad implications for society are significant I concede this statement because from a game design perspective it would be boring and repetitive and give the player less options. I think that matters more than the nebulous relationship media much less this game has with the negativity of society.I dont really think people would be that hurt. But I think your reasoning and the integrity of your morals are a bit inconsistent for someone who is trying to demand an author to create his work in a way differently than he envisioned.Im still a bit stuck on how inconsistent your morals are.Does the developer of Mortal Combat hear about  year olds playing his game and then think to himself Oh dear what have I done?No he thinks to himself Oh dear what are their parents doing?!Underaged viewing of mature  nsfw content is the fault of faulty parental supervision not the fault of the game developer.You are worried about this game influencing people to think certain things are okay when in reality they are not. But you also provide your own counterexample.Nobody is influenced to think that violence is okay just because it happens in video games. Nor is there any subtle pervasive learning of that idea over time.Why? Because social interaction in real life supercedes any social learning one can derive from games or media.If you try to kill or do perverted things people quickly respond negatively. However in the case of perverted things people dont always respond negatively which is what I am contending is the real source of problem mindsets.For the most part real life does a good job of waking people up to reality and disconnecting them from the game. Id say its disingenuous to discredit the power of real life interactions over subtle pervasive implications. I go back to your Dude No. quote.Whether or not you live in a ghetto could be a big factor. Where I grew up everyone is properly raised taught etc with basic morals and everyone socially punishes things like perversion or other bad behavior.Hell if that stuff properly happens in slums.Now I assume you are prepared to sayBecause I believe sexuality in gaming has a negative impact on society it should not be as prevalent in YanSim.You are also prepared to sayBecause I believe sexuality in gaming has a negative impact on society it should not be as prevalent in all games.If you are not prepared to say this then I demand an explanation for why your morals are relevant for one game but irrelevant when the same exact thing happens in another game. I assume your morals are not so flimsy and that you are prepared to make that statement.You are also prepared to sayBecause of my specific beliefs all game developers should be restricted to conform to my beliefs.This is simply a restatement of the same thing above.This kind of statement is why I contest the notion of having the game tailored to an audience it is not intended for.You must also be prepared to sayBecause of my specific beliefs other people should be imposed to restrict their actions based on my beliefs.I know Im getting into the realm of a completely different moral argument now but this kind of thing irks me.When people have a certain very specific choice when confronted with something they are uncomfortable with .... Ignore the thing Im uncomfortable with and leave it alone.. Impose restrictions and changes upon that thing.I think at this point I can conclude that a game with sexuality is just too disturbing for you. In which case I think its on you to ignore it.I do perceive a disconnect between that and the followingWhen people are confronted with something literally dangerous or harmful or with knowably negative impact. Ignore the thing and be a bystander.. Take action and stop it from happening.It is one thing if I agreed with your beliefs and thought that sexuality in gaming has a significant tangible and directly negative impact on society.But... there is a disconnect between our beliefs at that point.I can agree with the following statementBecause X has a knowably negative impact on society everyone should be restricted from X.If you really believe sexuality in gaming is so bad I think you would better spend your time arguing in court supreme court or similar in order to get it banned from all games.I dont believe its so bad and so I dont believe game developers should be so restricted.This is a pretty good conversation though I havent yet met someone whos forced me to think through this kind of matter so thoroughly.In a world where the impact of gaming on society is extremely certain and in fact more certain and more significant than merely the impact of bad upbringing I would completely agree with you that stuff like this only makes the problem worse.Alas I dont seem to see the world that way.,yandere_simulator,de0wqor,2,t5_37nnf

Unless a very cartoonishly big head ala wind waker is included with the new models faces simply will occupy too little of the screen to be of great concern for  of the actual game. Faces could use an uplift as it stands but it might be more beneficial to not devote too much resources on the small perfect faces. ,yandere_simulator,dgbueks,5,t5_37nnf
