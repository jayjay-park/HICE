1876202,0,t3_2g2j9u,Im having to reinstall all the games I lost when my hard drive started to fail so Im mostly playing Dark Souls because thats the only shit I have install thus far. But Ive started installing a bunch of other stuff.Warframe  Waiting on the good alerts and makin some Kubrows. Wondering when Ill ever have enough Neural Sensors.Dark Souls II  Trying to connect to Drew for the postLordvessel stuff mostly just poking things with my Lightning Spear. Gonna do the DLC with Chan at some point on my new Sorceress. If anyone has an extra Desert Sorceress top thatd help me out immensely.Shovel Knight  Just took out Propeller Knight headed to Tinker Knight next.Defiance  Just got it installed. I was excited for the gametv crossover idea never had a chance to get it working when it first came out. I assume theyve changed it since it came out but Im having a good time thus far. Dont think Ive even finished the tutorial though.Thats about it. Im trying to reinstall everything so I can play like The Witcher on DampD nights or Mark of the Ninja. I wanted to restart my Mass Effect playthroughs and fix where I did the wrong ParagonRenegade interrupt or whatever.Oh yeah not just PC.Animal Crossing New Leaf  Its the only thing in my DS right now so when I pull it out I wander around town dig up fossils. If its nighttime this month is the Scorpion rare bug so Ive been kinda looking for that. I saw one and it stung me.I would play Demons Souls but Im afeared.,SevenBranchedSword,ckf9xdx,2,t5_33ib8
