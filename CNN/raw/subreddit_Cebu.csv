5261700,0,t3_3mxqgk,There is a large and active mountain biking scene. The uplands of Cebu are crisscrossed with hundreds of trails and tracks through very scenic terrain. Id very much recommend you do something with that rather than try to cycle in the city because Its hot and humid. A typical day is  F and  humidity. Heat stroke and dehydration are real risks. Drivers are psychotic drunk andor high on drugs. Taxi and jeepney drivers are well known for their meth use. Theres no enforcement of DUI and traffic laws. If youre only used to first world traffic you have no idea how much idiocy youll encounter on the roads here. Plenty of drivers will take pleasure in running you off the road. Pollution. People dont want to or cant afford to maintain their cars and every other vehicle belches smoke. A white t shirt will turn grey after a couple hours out there. Youll be sucking smokey exhaust the entire time too that cant be good for your lungs.If you want to be outdoors ditch the city and get out into the province. Its cool and pleasant at higher elevations theres no traffic and the people are a lot friendlier.,Cebu,cvk8nx4,4,t5_2s92t

8949489,0,t3_52tuyn,Pretty sure this just proves that Cebuanos complain more because having driven in both Cebu and Manila there is no way Cebu is worse for driving. Manila is a goddamn mess.,Cebu,d7nlgf7,1,t5_2s92t
