If we dont win it probably isnt on BR but there is a difference between saying next match is must win and going after the manager.

This is also about to happen in Germany with the creation of SuperBayern.Over the next decade I think we will see an even increased distance in terms of financial success and competition between the CL teams and everyone else.

So only Moses and Sterling are actual wingers. Of course we need another attacking option off the bench or to push Sterling for a starting spot. We definitely need a DM which is what everyone says on every topic but we also need another winger. I find it odd some people dont think we do. What happens if Sterling gets injured or hits a run of bad form? We literally have no other option. Unless Moses gets his ass in gear.,LiverpoolFC,cf04scj,28,t5_2qn0o

271559,0,t3_1x77w7,i liked coutinho playing a little deeper in the center of midfield. I think mayhaps sitting one of sterling suarez or sturridge would be the best call. Gerrard in the deep role but I worry how mobile the midfield for Arsenal are. Allen and Henderson in the midfield should keep the workrate high. With Allens pressing and Henderson able to break forward and support.These three make us look decent defensively and is probably the most sound  we can field.  I like the way Coutinho played coming back in the middle and making tackles WBA or Everton Game cant remember. He needs to play around the Arteta area of the field. Last time we played Arsenal we were missing the link up to our attack and it was a lot of playing the ball up and hoping the front men could create against numbers. Cou if commiting himself defensively in this role should be able to get some good looks going forward. Obviously I think this is the most important role. Henderson or Allen should be able to support and join the attack giving us a decent presence going up while Gerrard and the other are still holding the fort.  Up front I would play any two of SaSaS. Honestly doesnt matter which two for me. Against my better judgement I would sit Suarez or play him instead of Phil just to fuck with Arsenal and bring him at the half. but we can really play any  Im ranting at this point but our backline we dont have much choice in w injuries. tldr                         Cissokho Toure Skrtel Cafu                                     Gerrard                                 Allen      Henderson                                      Coutinho                            Sterling   SturridgeCoutinho is key could swap one of front two with Suarez. ,LiverpoolFC,cf8wojg,0,t5_2qn0o

306773,0,t1_cfcjydw,Absolutely! However I feel cautious about introducing too much change with something that wasnt broken recently. Even so Ill be eagerly waiting for the lineup against Fulham. Cant make up my mind which would be better stick with a defense that has shown signs they are starting to get used to one another or introduce change to the back line. On paper the answer is simple but DA and GJ are only just coming back from injury and I have a tough time deciding which is a bigger risk  starting players who have been out recetly or sticking with a youngster whos done well a veteran who recently committed a major error and a very average left back.

But we created far more of the chances and deserved at least a replay if it wasnt for Webb.Go look at the match stats we dominated Arsenal in all areas shots shots on target possession.

355776,0,t3_1y4ob0,The loss on Sunday reminded me of the second leg of the quarter final Champions League tie against Chelsea in . At the time we were in the same sort of situation in the league where we are now playing really well  the team was playing really confidently and thought they were going to win every game. We ended up losing to Chelsea over the two legs but we played really well in that second leg and as a result the loss didnt really damage morale and affect our league form. I feel its going to be the same with the loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup. We were really unlucky not to win or at least get a replay out of the game it was a really good performance. I think the players know this and it wont have much of an effect on the level of confidence of the team. I think at the beginning of Brendans reign he was telling the team that the most important thing he wanted from the team was a good performance. In other words even if the team lost if they played decently he was telling the that if they put in performances like that every week the results will come. Hopefully now he is telling them that the team has evolved and now expectations are different. There will be those days where Liverpool is playing well against smaller teams but the goal just isnt coming. Those are the games where the players cant feel sorry for themselves and have to find a way to score a goal sounds cliche I know. The  team had that mentality and I remember them pulling results out against teams like Portsmouth coming from behind and winning  and at Fulham away winning  near the end thanks to a Benayoun goal. Also hopefully he is establishing a team ethos so that even when the team is playing badly they can still nick a result another cliche the good teams win even when they arent playing well. tldr I think Brendan is transforming this team from instead of focusing on results focusing on good performances to now making results the priority over performance  ,LiverpoolFC,cfhn5db,2,t5_2qn0o

I just dont see them realistically dropping enough points over what we will more than likely drop for us to bridge the gap on them.City are a tough call they play well and tear teams apart then they fail to show up and struggle to put games away. Aguero is a big loss to them and if we were to catch either of the two CityChelsea It would be City. Arsenal are in for a very very rough month or so they could either come out of it strong and fighting for the top or sitting behind in th.If we win the games we should be winning and avoid any crazy mistakes at the back Id expect us to be fighting for second with City.I can just see Chelsea grinding out yet more boring wins with City continuing to implode at random.,LiverpoolFC,cfupbyf,2,t5_2qn0o

On them nights league form goes out of the window as we proved in .  Im not saying that they will destroy opposition but it only takes the likes of Van Persie and Rooney to turn it on in these games and the could quite easily slip past some bigger teams over two legs.  Plus CL has to be their number one priority at the moment to save a failed season and get them European football for next.

614941,0,t3_216lew,With the win over Southampton which credit to Spurs didnt think they had it in them they wont be desperate for points or trying to break a losing streak. Which on the one hand is good because desperate teams can put up a fight as we saw with Cardiff but its also unfortunate because this Spurs team tends to fall apart under pressure Southampton notwithstanding. So from a psychology factor it could go either way. Assuming Adebayor is still hurt they wont have a credible threat up top unless they win a bunch of penalties in which case Soldado will do just fine but Eriksen could be a problem.I think its important to not get too cocky going into the game. We were cocky before Villa and they left Anfield with a point. We were a little cocky before Swansea and they gave us a game. Spurs could be tricky. We cant fall asleep on them.Other than that... yeah. All the best Tim.,LiverpoolFC,cga64x0,1,t5_2qn0o

I dont think there is anything untoward going on there but one could say there is with no proof and leave the burden of proof to you that there isnt which is exactly what you are doing to City.  It was a  year deal for M with great terms for the club in terms of otherthankit merchandising and was well over the odds to be honest.  I think Warrior saw it as a lossleader as an entry point into the soccerfootball kit market.  By comparison City only get M from Nike and Arsenal just signed a deal for M from Puma so by those standards M plus control over nonkit merchandising is a pretty good deal for a club not even in the CL.Again by comparison how do you explain the other .M of our commercial deals that isnt coming from Warrior and Standard Chartered?  I doubt that you can and neither can I.  For all I know Henrys dog is sponsoring our official Liverpool Dog Treat for M per year.  I agree Citys left over money pool seems high but seeing as I have  evidence of any wrong doing I think it bizarre to put the burden of proof on them that they arent.

737502,0,t3_22lvm7,Actually a really shit Guardian article  nowhere near the level of most of their stuff.For an article supposedly about Liverpools transformation into title challengers it sure talks about United a fuckton.Lets actually answer the question then shall we?The managers system is versatile and makes us play as a team. Rodgers has found a compromise between his ideal possessionbased football and the more direct nature of the squad hes got at his disposal. Were ruthless on the counterattack relentless when we press and gradually becoming more patient in possession when teams park the bus against us. Being able to do all of those lets us approach different teams in different ways  and thats without even mentioning our flexibility with formations. Most importantly we have a recognisable identity and system that not only suits our players but makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.Mental strength. The dressing room seems really focused calm and resilient. Its hard to quantify this stuff and compare it to previous seasons but weve got Suarez keeping a cool head on the pitch Gerrard talking about how previous sides would feel sorry for themselves but this one doesnt and a number of youngsters playing like experienced PL veterans. Credit to Rodgers manmanagement and the work of Dr. Steve Peters  and despite his occasional fuck ups on the pitch bringing in Kolo on a free from City was a masterstroke to replace Carraghers experience and leadership.No European football has certainly helped given how small our squad is especially in the attacking positions. Its also helped with match preparation and allowing Rodgers to keep players fit and fresh  not many teams would be able to continue to press with the intensity we do this late in the season and that could prove vital in these last  games.Rodgers individual coaching has vastly improved certain players and helped us cover for our lack of squad depth by making other players more flexible. Hendersons flourished Skrtels rejuvenated Flanagans come out of exile to become a regular  at leftback!  Sterling can play both flanks and behind the striker Coutinho can play as a CM and Gerrards taken on the Xabi Alonso mantle.Suarez and Sturridge. Well duh  both are having the best goalscoring seasons of their careers I dont care how many Suarez scored in a single season for Ajax the PL is obviously a much tougher league. Credit to Rodgers for finding ways to get them both playing up front at the same time and credit to them for putting in a shift and not complaining during those times one of them has to play out wide.Fewer individual errors leading to goal. Yeah theres been some and some have certainly cost us points but all in all its been much better than last season. Mignolets been a big part of that and Skrtel returning to form has helped as well.Our set piece strength has helped make up for the lack of goals from midfield.Lack of expectationpressure. Were starting to show now that we can handle the pressure but theres no doubt its helped that we werent even being mentioned as dark horses in this title race for much of the first half of the season. The goal was top  and even then Rodgers had his mantra of constant improvement and a longterm plan and it can only have helped ensure we got into our titlechallenging position without being under pressure the whole time.,LiverpoolFC,cgo3wfj,5,t5_2qn0o
740920,0,t3_22i2aa,So whats the verdict? Allen or Lucas in the starting midfield... both? Or woudl that be too negative. Do we go with the diamond? Whos on the tip? Sterling and Coutinho combined?

We hold on to every little thing that the replay shows but forget how many penalties we could concede if we applied the same standard to our self.If we dont win the title this season I think it will be all down to the little things some of ours draws have flattered the opposition and we could do with fixing those first rather than what has otherwise been great season for us in terms of penalties won and conceded.,LiverpoolFC,cgosx55,2,t5_2qn0o

Would like them in  positions now Gerrard is a CDM we need a CM. I hear Rakitics name Ill trust the fanbase and assume hes good. A LB would like Shaw but thats unlikely. And a general attacker who can play across the front. For Lallana to take his game to the next level he would need to a join a CL club I think he could suit well.

784575,0,t1_cgte3je,Things do change quickly but Klopp wrestled the Bundesliga away from Bayern and then they defended it. Last year they came second by some margin to an untouchable Bayern team but emerged from a CL group with Real Madrid Ajax and a terrible tbf Man City. Then they went through Real Madrid in style during the knockouts and lost the final by a single goal to a stillrabid Bayern.My point is that even though I believe he is about to Rodgers hasnt won anything quite yet. I as much as anyone hope Rodgers even outFergies Fergie over the next two decades but if you are just judging Rodgers and Klopp over the past season it is not a fair contest because Klopp is at a completely different point in his tenure in a completely different league with CL different owners and different expectations to meet. How do you quantify and compare something like managerial quality under those circumstances?They are both incredible managers and I hope Brendan and the boys never stop winning but when they do I hope he continues to inspire them onward and upward like Klopp has managed to do at Dortmund the last few years. I just see more value in sustained periods of success and stability rather than a single flash in the pan season.

839086,0,t3_23ps35,In my opinion the positions we NEED are a winger and a fullback. Other transfers are contingent upon who leaves. Right now Enrique is an unknown and Johnson may be on his way out. Flanno can be good for a FB position maybe Wisdom as well but if Enrique and Johnson leave we need at least two more fullbacks.If Agger I say Agger because its most likely him but it could be any centerback leaves hell need replacing unless Ilori can step up next season.We could look into another midfielder but I think in his new position it would be unwise to stick a pure DM Like Mvila next to Stevie. Wed basically be looking for a deepplaymaker backup for him and then for our other two CM spots we have Hendo Allen Coutinho and perhaps Suso.I expect Agger Reina Johnson Kelly Assaidi and Aspas to leave this summer. Borini replaces Aspas and Kelly Assaidi and Reina dont need replacing so I would expect our summer business to be a winger two fullbacks a center back and perhaps a younger deep CM. From there I would expect to see more of Alberto Suso Ibe Texeira and perhaps Wisdom Smith and Ilori to fill out the team. ,LiverpoolFC,cgznnnx,3,t5_2qn0o

Funny thing is that when you meet people and find out they like football you can sort of tell who they support by their age and who won or was winning at the time they started to support their clubs.

It happens and everyone wants to be part of a winning collective so thats fair enough. Ive forced Liverpool Football Club down the throats of some of my friends and colleagues and the way they support the club makes me really proud.

Would have been a penalty and sending off instead his side which finished more than thirty points ahead of Liverpool failed to equalise. Not win. Equalise.Complaining about not having good enough centre forwards about refereeing conspiracies and so on and so forth. Adopting a no one likes usme and weI dont care mentality has its plusses.

Defensively this team was a shambles for much of the season its a glaring weakness...and fortunately its not as difficult a weakness to rectify as being offensively poor. We scored a lot of goals this year. Those same players should all be here hopefully with a few upgrades. Weve got the two best forwards in England Sterling Coutinho etc...all the same ingredients to score  goals a game. But hopefully next season with defense being stressed a bit more we wont have to.

I honestly wouldnt be starting him and were not in a position where we can afford to have a m  year old CB sitting on the bench. I think Caulker has potential and hes a good leader.

Could of had a hattrick had his finishing not let him down but he was very unselfish and provided assists for both Aspas and Borini. Should definitely get a loan at a premier league club this season looks like he needs to take the step up but he is still to raw to play for us I feel. Leicester City could be a spot for him? Teixeira looked very comfortable on the ball the only way I could describe his playstyle is elegant. Hes not the fastest on the ball but like Suso his close control and dribbling get him out of tight positions. Id rate him very close to Suso in terms of ability with a bit more defensive qualities than him. Smith also impressed me I believe the hype around this kid played very smartly and has a huge burst of pace about him.

1138104,0,t3_275j7q,With the BBC reporting it now Im very optimistic about our chances of getting him. I genuinely do think well get him sooner or later this summer.Of course another club could come in and bid for him like Spurs or Chelsea or someone perhaps even United but I dont think hell go to a team outside the CL and I also dont think hell go somewhere just to sit on the bench.With him and Henderson being  and  at the start of next season respectively that could be the future of our midfield for the next  years. Add to that the chance to work alongside and learn from Stevie for the next couple of years at least. Half the England first team are our lads and we share many similarities to Southampton in the style of football we play and how Anglocentric our squad has become over the last few years.  Even if we have to wait until after the World Cup which we undoubtedly will now hopefully being around the Liverpool lads for a few weeks this summer will make him realise how close they all are and he might want to be a part of that.Anyway just my opinion but I will be shocked if we dont get him to be quite honest.,LiverpoolFC,chxnbdq,19,t5_2qn0o

I think that would certainly be the ideal situation Flanagan continues to progress Glen Johnson is thanked for his service at Liverpool and his contract is allowed to run out Flanagan is the regular RB with Wisdom backing him up.That RB position would still be a bit young and a bit inexperienced but if we have solid CBs i.e. Sakho Agger and Skrtel for now and potentially Lovren we should be alright for the shortterm and more than alright for the future.,LiverpoolFC,cj273zk,1,t5_2qn0o

Will be good if we get to see Sturridge and Markovic Can looks great and physical too which is a big advantage in the BPL. Coutiniho is great as always however I think what is already a great player would become top class if he could add a clinical lethality in front of goal to his game. Lambert struggled to get in to the game mostly because of delivery I guess not sure what to think of him as I never really saw much of him at Southampton either so time will tell.

Hes just not yet at his peak. Which is a good thing. Lambert is a backup for  mil hardly worth mentioning in the grand scheme of financial discussions and Markovic has been lauded as a top talent anyone with an eye for football knows that kid has a massive ceiling perhaps higher than even Sterling. Im not nearly as worried as you are. Id be more worried if we were like Arsenal last summer and spent all of our money on a guy like Ozil who could get a hurt or b not contribute because hes being paid based on his past NOT his future like all of the players we have signed. ,LiverpoolFC,cjdb3js,1,t5_2qn0o

Right now Cavani is one of the few experienced elite players who can emulate that sort of play style.  Yes I like teams that go young but real life isnt Football Manager and if ANY team wants a deep run in Champions League and a shot at the BPL then they need experience as well. This team as presently constituted is not winning the BPL and not getting a deep run in Champions League.  I mean look at last years Champions League.For every Koke Arda and Bale theres a Villa Xabi and Gabi.

Himself and his family cop criticism from Sunderland fans because of this betrayal. With Kennys faith Hendo shows a few glimpses of potential in his debut season but he never finds form. Now the media are on his back. Maybe Hendo isnt good enough. New management and things get worse. Joe Allen is brought in and Hendo seems to be phased out. Hendo considers his footballing future  he is advised to move away from Liverpool to get playing time and better develop hes still young he has plenty of time. Brendan Rodgers publicly states that Henderson is surplus to requirements. Against all advice and seemingly logic Henderson refuses to leave Liverpool and states that he will fight for his place. Even Liverpool fans cant help but chuckle at this lad. Henderson is clustered with Andy Carroll Joe Cole and Charlie Adam as the expensive waste of Dalglishs term. With lack of depth in the squad injuries see Hendo make his first appearance of the season against Swansea in December. . With every game Hendo attracts less and less criticism. Hendo scores in the  against Norwich and assists Liverpools first against Arsenal and scores their second. Suddenly Hendo is involved with Liverpools goals and theres nothing anyone can do except praise him. In  Hendo is at the heart of the Liverpool team playing  games in BRs most successful campaign to date. Liverpool look on track to snatch the league but then a reckless slide tackle in the dying seconds of a  win over Man City sees Hendo gain his first career red. Hendo is sent off and banned from two of the last  league games. Hendo watches the slip from the sidelines.  Brendan Rodgers states that he knew the title was gone as soon as Hendo was given Red.  Liverpool make a rocky start to the season but stabilise under Hendersons influence as vicecaptain its like theres two Gerrards on the field. Liverpool go on to win many league titles and trophies during the span of Hendos career as VCcaptain and he is heralded maybe the best LFC captain of all time because he just never stopped running.His movie will be called Never Stop Running or The Captain with Bad Gait,LiverpoolFC,ckjq33m,33,t5_2qn0o

1917322,0,t3_2gleid,Ignoring the penalty Manquillo has been fucking solid since he has come in. Runs as much as Hendo puts in half a dozen tackles and interceptions every game. There is still not great understanding between him and the rest of the players but he always tries to run up to give options even if the ball doesnt come.The rest of the defense did well for the most part the opponents had some great chances but our midfield didnt make the same chances do to being under pressure I felt the midfield should have done more to give the defense cover.Balo and now Borini are players who will play their part this season they will work well with our pressing system. Lallana and Sterling showed some glimpses of their quality but they were a bit off tonight with some of their passing and last touch.Migs has improved a lot he tries more and passes from the back more but coming off his line to open the goal isnt one of them. He really needs to stay a bit conservative when the ball is under the control of the striker.We are missing freekicks Suarez and Sturridge provided in front o the penalty area too many of our free kicks are practically from midfield or far off.

That said Moreno was out of position in the first place which gave them the opportunity but still Sakho went to ground in the box and if we had conceded there I dont think you could have blamed anyone but Sakho.,LiverpoolFC,cklqcjs,2,t5_2qn0o

Whether we like it or not he is one of the senior players in the side now and should look to take control of the side when Gerrard is being marked out of the game.Lallana was promising today and I think he will become a key player as the season goes on when he becomes more comfortable with the rest of the team when we have a regular staring . Todays performance was especially inept and we couldnt even play long ball football properly when Lambert came on.Having said all this I feel we will be much improved when Sturridge and Allen come back and hopefully Coutinho can find some form to provide more fluidity and creativity to the attack. ,LiverpoolFC,cknxm1i,2,t5_2qn0o

West Brom had three really clear cut chances  the missed header and then a couple of Berahino shots. Apart from that they really didnt create all that much. From set pieces we were solid and Mignolet did what everyones been clamoring for him to do which is to come out and clear the ball from inside the six yard box. On the other hand we created several opportunities and couldve had three or four. It wasnt perfect by a long shot but it was a hell of a lot better than the last few months and easily our secondbest performance of the season. ,LiverpoolFC,cl09jkd,2,t5_2qn0o

2199640,0,t3_2kak4q,Clean sheet? Skrtel looked solid as a rock. The back four never looked like conceding honestly. Liverpool looked so much better when playing with Balo and Lambert up top. Lambert played well enough for a start against Swansea for me. Balo needs a rest and some more practice finishing because we should all be talking about his goal now.  clear chances I counted. Two headers one where he fumbled it when  on  with a keeper and then looked for a pen. Not good enough but I appreciate his work rate. He is a striker though. Clumsy with his fouling and kept going down when staying up may have resulted in a goal or at least a chance. ,LiverpoolFC,cljffnz,2,t5_2qn0o

2313418,0,t3_2ls98z,Good points. I actually noticed a huge problem with Lovren yesterday in addition to his general defending being poor. There was an excerpt from Suarez book posted here last week where he described Rodgers plan for Liverpools style of play. It emphasised playing the ball out from the back on the ground with constantly moving midfielders opening up space. Lovren Ive noticed prefers to hoof it long. Balotelli will sometimes be able to take it down and hold the ball up but we have a very short midfield that struggles to win balls in the air. Basically a huge amount of cheap possession losses are coming from Lovrens long balls. Hes not Gerrard or even Henderson he cannot pull that off and it means we lose possession so quickly. I saw him do it twice yesterday from the left back position so not only was he booting it long and losing it he was also out of position when he was doing so. Hes a fucking bombscare he needs to be dropped for  games to get his head together because he is such an incredible liability just now. ,LiverpoolFC,clxnjlc,3,t5_2qn0o

2314042,0,t1_clxo6m1,I agree fully with you on the first one. The system hasnt changed much since last season but our strikeforce has. We play the ball up to strikers that arent there strikers that our manager hasnt figured out yet... I dont think any backline would be comfortable with Gerrard covering them and its blatantly obvious too. Hes not a defensive mid and I would like to see us go with Henderson there and let Can take over Hendersons role. Our defenders seem confused as to exactly how they should deal with situations. This is not down to their quality this is down to poor coaching and management. You see teams with sub par defenders play a good organised defensive game all the time it isnt magic. In the end the whole of the problem is the entire way our team is working. When one vital part fails to be productive the entire team fails as well. Our players also look less hungry this year and work ethics seem to have taken a turn for the worse. I would like to see us do well but if this continues we might have a new boss somewhere in the new year.

How in the world is the second best option Remy?  Seriously?  There was no one else in world football between those two?We have Mignolet.  Decent enough keeper but I dont think many would argue that a replacement might be a wise investment and if you had to pick weak points from last season hed surely be one.  We got no one in his position.Gerrard as a CDM.  Makes no sense never has and is borderline criminal.  Yet we picked up no better CDM some might argue Can I suppose.LB is the only spot we did the right thing.  We had a weakness there in Enrique got a better player in and now Enrique is a great option to have as nd choice.  Job done.

He was the outlet. We were put under massive pressure predominantly dealt with by the CBs and Henderson and then they win the ball get to Stevie and he launches the counter attack. As a defensive DM he was poor last year too just his creativity worked.

2552615,0,t1_cmrqj1n,Haha no. Criticism of Rodgers is fine. I believe a lot of the fans on here are people who started supporting us last year gloryhunters who just like the idea of supporting a successful club and dont have any patience for the odd poor run of form. Like the ones that became overnight fans when Chelsea and City started winning things. Or the ones that support Manchester United by default because theyre the most successful club in Premier League history. Fans who clearly cant have been supporting us for very long because if they did theyd be used to us occasionally being midtable or even in the bottom half and wouldnt take that as an instant reason to sack the manager. People with context basically.This isnt everyone who criticizes Rodgers. But my hunch is its a significant faction who havent seen how changing managers has impacted us in the past.Also please repost your comment and we can take a poll on just how classy it was.

2560667,0,t1_cmsrvzo,Torres is just about the same as Borini at this point really except that Borini is  years younger and far more hungry to prove himself.  Torres would be making a silly wage demand relative to his current ability and Borinis wages as well.  Id pick Borini over Torres at this point.  The only big thing about Torres now is his name and the letters on the back of the kit arent going to score the goals themselves.  I have a fantasy in my brain of us scooping him up and him remembering how to finish becoming revitalized and going on to have a  goal return over the second half of the season but in reality I think theres just no chance of it.Also a striker is far more important than a keeper or a fullback IMO.  All these stupid  losses would turn into  draws or  wins with a proper dangerous forward leading the line.  When we are able to attack with pace and strength we will relieve pressure from our defense.  Mignolet can make it until summer when well have a much better chance of bringing in the right keeper rather than getting taken to the cleaners for one in January just based on availability.,LiverpoolFC,cmste4y,2,t5_2qn0o

When both on form Bony is less of a fit for our team than Balotelli. I know we dont have Sturridge at the moment but when we do then we can play Balotelli with him. Bony? I dont know much about his ability to play with a partner havent seen it  so I doubt it. It wouldve just been too much of a turn from last seasons tactics. Now? Im sure many would take a short term option but for me it would be too big of a commitment to buy Bony. Hed probably get  year contract. Balotelli is on  years isnt he?

2895622,0,t1_cnx72h5,first off I havent seen him play much. none of us have. BUT I have tried.  I watch youth games when I can and watch the highlights from lfc.vn. Have done so for  seasons so Ive seen a bit of Rossiter and the other names here. Rossiter has a good range of passing but I dont see the huge technical ability. For me a technical player means one that is great at keeping the ball and able to play his way out of pressure. Technical  composed on the ball. Technicality for me is all about how a player handles tight situations. Having a good first touch under pressure having a good first touch at full pace being able to play out of trouble being able to beat a man one on one...these things for me are what I consider technical. So under this definition while Jordan Henderson is an extremely good passer of the ball I dont consider him very technical. He shys away from pressure which is smart but there are advantages to having a technical player such as Joe Allen or Coutinho who arent afraid of bringing the ball up themselves by passing a defender in the midfield. Rossiter hasnt really show this trait when Ive seen him. Sure maybe thats because the coach has instructed him to play this way but I think its because hes not that type of player. When you watch youth games Chirivella shows much more confidence and technicality on the ball. Same with Wilson. Rossiter can be good but I just dont see why so many people say hes a technical player. ,LiverpoolFC,cnx8ijg,1,t5_2qn0o

2963889,0,t1_co4zpti,I never said Balotelli was a poor striker because he doest press. Balotelli is for example a perfect striker for Mourinho because his philosophy involves dropping deep as soon as you lose the ball which Balotelli has been accustomed to doing since he was a teenager I suspect. Balotelli never has been part of a pressing team and thats a fact as Rafa would say. Rodgers categorically and quite correctly said if you cant press you will not play. You can read it here So yes thats why Balotelli hasnt been playing. Ironically if Balotelli did learn to press as well as Sturridge we wouldve achieved a lot more points since he is one of the few natural finishes in the squad. Rodgers is to blame for the lack of productivity from our strikers? Really? I bet if you gave Rodgers free reign at the start of last summers transfer window the squad would be much different then what it is now. Speed and mobility are  key principles of Rodgers game. And thats exactly what Balotelli opposes. So how is it Rodgers fault that he ended up with Balotelli? If a junior like myself can see that Balotelli wouldnt fit us then of course Rodgers would see it. Do you honestly believe Rodgers wanted Balotelli? Because I am telling you now its a fact that Balotelli is everything against a Rodgers typical player.You clearly dont understand Rodgers principle of play if you think high pressing crap is nonsense. As mentioned before Balotellis mobility and pressing couldnt be further away from the ideal Rodgers player. Football is a bit more complex than he needs a link up striker. No its not very simple at all. Ironic how a person who has never made a single substitution in a game is questioning Rodgers thinking and tactical nous. You dont fully appreciate Rodgers at all and what he has done to us. Pressing mobility and speed has been the thesis thus far of Rodgers rein here.

3066900,0,t1_cobebsi,this wont be read as Im way late to the party but alas I cant help it. Thats not true at all. They very much would have liked him to stay permanently but they knew we would trigger his release clause. We were counting on him to be our late Kroos replacement no shit joining us next year when hed be more mature similar as Kroos did in . Unfortunately Vller hates us with a passion ever since we bought all their best players. This was back in the day when they still were contenders. He now tries to sabotage us as much as he can whenever he CAN wouldnt sell us Vidal if his life was depending on it and even settled for less money from Juve. Vidal wanted to join us. Logically he should have kept him for one more season but that would have ment him joining us. No way good old Rudy would let this happen. We contacted Can and tried to  pay him his buy out money immidiatly so he would stay there until next year when our buyout clause would be activated but he was already set for Liverpool. Out of spite Rummenigge is now trying really hard to land their biggest talent Julian Brandt just to get back at them. Actually this shit is quiet funny.

As sick as I am I have to talk about this because theres no other example as near as him. We do have overwage previously in Joe Cole now his turn.Edit In addition to this Im afraid that Sterling wont sign new contract because the one we offers is lowered down due to total salary cap provided by owner. Apart from Gerrard and Sturridge Balotelli is one of our highest paid player and he doesnt even feature in Rodgers gameplan. In short our decision to blindly sign player like Balotelli might affect the future contract offers to our key players just like Sterling and Henderson.,LiverpoolFC,cog9mk1,-2,t5_2qn0o

3167844,0,t3_2wf4my,Listen here I have noticed a trend with DHL. What happens to your buy is that your order gets put together and then processed. It now sits there waiting for other orders to be received. This is because LFC knows its having a huge sale and is making shipping economic. I came to this conclusion because throughout this sub people from various parts of the world have asked about their package and some say  week processing others say  weeks. Its all regional. Once that threshold is reached which is subjective LFC sends over their massive order to a DHL hub for delivery. For overseas orders like in my case DHL will send everything to one of their regional hubs as here in the U.S. there arent DHLs like there are Fedex or UPS. From there they get processed and sorted out and every which package goes its way. That takes  days max. The longest time is that processing in Liverpool. Once it gets to DHL itll be a day and a half in air processed in another day. And sent out to you in the next. This is why people say that once they see its done processing they are getting messages about courier pickup the next day. The hold up is that LFC needs x amount of orders in x region to send out their parcels. You can call DHL Express anytime and ask them anything their number is on their site. These guys are fast as shit and real fucking pros. Another point to validate this is that I just got my package yesterday after a delay from a snow storm. So did others in here coincidentally.

3177023,0,t1_coqvyqh,I agree. Broken down I see the situation like this Mario should not have taken the ball like that but should have asked. Hendo gives the ball to Mario. He could have said fuck off its mine but seemed to be willing to let the ball go. Hendo walks away shaking his head because he doesnt want to put pressure on the taker as Mario was obviously determined to take it. Sturridge is the one who escalates the situation by being completely headless and putting pressure on the taker instead of shutting his face.  Hendo and Sturridge are in the wrong to not join in on the celebration . Merely a pat on the back from Studge and Hendo had to be pulled back by Mario.  Henderson does a good post match interview playing the situation down.  Gerrard should never have been in the studio as a current player and should never have openly criticized Mario for the situation as Hendo had already played it down.,LiverpoolFC,corapn5,1,t5_2qn0o

3183639,0,t3_2wli14,People are taking the wrong end of the stick regarding Rodgers comment. Its fairly clear that Rodgers thinks Balotelli will get better if he demands more of him rather than praise him. Its a common football tactic that when a player gets comfortable and complacent you either fire him up with derogatory comments like this or sell him because theres a good chance that being comfortable means lesser performances something people point as the reason for Reinas downfall.Rodgers isnt stupid. He knows what contribution Balotelli made on that game. But sometimes when you have Balotelli type players in your team you need to have a harsh relationship with him rather than a soft relationship with him. Every player has a different type of relationship with the manager because not everyone is the same. And there are different ways of treating someone as a manager. Sometimes you need to be patient and praise them and other times you need to be almost militaristic with them.,LiverpoolFC,corzfkg,15,t5_2qn0o
3184285,0,t3_2wlue8,If its best for the team then yes. By that I mean if his form is good then yeah but if hes playing poor then no and also how Henderson is doing with captaining the team.

3188198,0,t3_2wmby2,While I agree with the point hes trying to make I can tell you why we were singing Youre not singing any more.  It started in the Lower Anfield Road end with the fans directly adjacent to the Besiktas fans.  I was one of the fans in this area.  While its true that the majority of their fans were a credit to their team there were a set of their fans whose only interest was intimidating and threatening our fans.  They faced us for the majority of the match staring down our support making threatening gestures screaming insults at us.  Extra security was sent up to the area.  Some people with children moved away.  It was a more charged atmosphere than a regular Premier League game but no one really gave a shit.  Some of our fans returned the middle fingers and reciprocated the stare downs and puffed their chests out right back.  After we scored and celebrated their fans started throwing things at us.  Coins plastic bottles filled with liquid and a lit cigarette stub I only saw one of these but there might have been more.  The song was a response to this.  Im not judging whether it was a good response or not Im just saying that this is what it was borne out of.  It wasnt a response to their fans being so vocal the whole match.  Real Madrids fans were fantastic and we applauded them at the end of the match despite losing.  It was a response to the fans on the fringe of the Besiktas area whose sole intention was threatening our support.EDIT  For the record I think this is an excellent article and I wholeheartedly agree with its sentiments.

3202517,0,t3_2wtbis,gtWe have most of our players tied to contractsYeah thats not a thing. Suarez signed a new contract like  months before he left. Just because players are contracted and still have a long time left doesnt mean they wont leave. Technically the club can try to refuse a transfer and force them to stay if theres no release clause but that usually leads to an ugly standoff if the player wants to leave and the end result tends to be them leaving anyway. gt Well definitely sign a big name player this summer I can guarantee you that and well almost likely spend on another striker this summer. Signing a big name player is extremely difficult without CL. We want CL caliber players but why would a CLcaliber player voluntarily choose to go to a nonCL club? Especially when we often cant offer as much as a the oil money clubs who buy everyone. To get the best players we need to be consistently in the CL not occasionally in it. gtIm absolutely confident we will place high again in the    season.I hope youre right. But keep in mind if we dont get CL we may well end up in Europa...which as far as Im concerned is just a waste of time. The very slim chance well win and get CL is not worth the mountains of potential injuries risked and the poorer performances in the PL from tired stars who just got back from a game in Bumfuck Russia late Thursday night. gtWeve a great chance of silverware this season.

No one in their right mind is expecting goals galore from him at the moment. That however doesnt mean he gets a free pass when he has a bad game  Balotelli has been criticised all season even by our manager and he deserves praise when he does well. Last night Balo was much better than Studge  he worked harder he had better vision and he made better use of possession. In my opinion that means he should start against City either alongside or ahead of Sturridge hes earned the place more this week.

The amount of points to catch up on is daunting but not impossible.  I feel man u will slip in at least one of their tough fixtures.  I see no reason to believe our run of form has ended it has just had a small hiccup.  Our success this side of the season has been largely without gerrard anyway.  Well miss skertl for sure but I think we can get top points from our remaining fixtures with a bit of luck. The loss to man u will be a good test of character.

The kid knows he can do it given the chance he stayed to prove that to everyone.I like him because hes a proper striker he doesnt wander back looking to get into the game and if you watch him his movement is really good but our players arent used to playing with someone making thoes kind of runs so the service he was getting last night was abysmal. with better final passes he could have had a couple last night.He had  goals in  starts last year  in  for a  struggling team imagine if he had  starts with players like coutinio behind him.,LiverpoolFC,cqbrgxn,3,t5_2qn0o

Yes its fast and free flowing but the players seem to be positionally disciplined highly technical and can defend! The English in their haste to get into fast flowing football pretty much have thrown their defence baby out with the bathwater Alderdyce was the last man standing but even West Ham told him to get into attractive attacking football or get out. Rodgers will have to deal with Europe sooner or later especially if hes talking about CL action or we get into Europa  we wont be able to escape Europe hell have to work on his defence and his players with that game. I know that Rafa has a mixed record but he wasnt afraid for his teams to dig deep and do ugly defending which is one of the reasons why Alonso learnt to defend the way he did and took those skills to Real Madrid.

All three of those players are gone basically this season. When you take the best  players off a team that almost won the title theyre going to get worse especially when one was the best player on the planet for that season. I dont think BR is a great coach but last season was so much about how fucking good Suarez is than this year is poor coaching. A lot of it IMO is we had so many new players that are decent but just not good enough and it makes picking your team a crapshoot because more than likely they wont be very good no matter what you do.,LiverpoolFC,cqs1qzi,1,t5_2qn0o
3824991,0,t1_cqs9y6t,Id agree with those three. I think they should all be our top priorities and look for a RB. Id be happy with that window. We could move both Marko and Can into the midfield and have Flanno back as a back up on the right. Something I like about Lacazette is that he seems to play similarly to Suarez.

3856946,0,t3_34lo4s,In regards to this issue I think some things became very clear to me Brendan Rodgers seems to believe that the best defence is a great offence. Which is fine when you have a Luis Suarez and a healthy Daniel Sturridge. Of course with hindsight being  it seems that it was a massive gamble and mistake to rely on Daniel Sturridge to be healthy. But we suddenly lost  goals and we struggled greatly because of that. Though we should be encouraged that our squad battled as hard as they did.So in a sort of oversimplified sense yah we do need a proper striker.But there are encouraging signs for the next season especially if Daniel Sturridge is completely healthy if Origi develops and adjusts quickly to the Premier League if the likes of Sterling Henderson Coutinho make the next step and add consistent goalscoring to their skills.For a variety of reasons I think our summer transfer window will actually be relatively quiet. But I do think well focus on getting the best striker we can possibly get relative to whatever limitations that we may have.I always felt as if  would be a transitional season but I fully expect  to be a great step forward.,LiverpoolFC,cqvxe4d,1,t5_2qn0o

3905731,0,t1_cr1bi6t,You dont know which players Rodgers signed and the transfer committee signed. Aspas Alberto Assaidi Balotelli all appear to be committee signings. Probably Markovic too. None have been great.Whilst we know for a fact that Rodgers didnt want Balotelli how do we know he wasnt the one who wanted Moreno or Aspas. We dont know who he signed and who he wanted because he hasnt come out and said anything.You cant just pick and chose who was signed by who when you dont know. Besides the transfer committee has been heavily criticised for signing players Rodgers allegedly didnt want.The bottom line is preventing the manager from having any control over transfer. Does not work. You might as well sack the manager although Im sure Rodger would walk out and with good reason if he was made to work under such restricting and borderline stupid conditions which would massively hinder the club. Preventing the manager from having influence on his squad is something you would do if you want to get relegated. ,LiverpoolFC,cr1hke6,1,t5_2qn0o

We may have had a decent transfer kitty but we couldnt lure the bigger names. Sanchez felt Arsenal were a more stable club in the top four so chose them. Im sure it would be a similar story with other players. We need more consistency first and until then we will have to go through wildcards like BalotelliLovren who could do well and will come.The fact of the matter is players arent sure about us rightfully and well need to build up our current day reputation a bit more before we become a good lure.,LiverpoolFC,cr1k2w3,2,t5_2qn0o

3907739,0,t3_356oaw,As much as I agree that Markovic would become marginalized by Depay signing I think the idea behind chasing Depay was that no matter what the position is you go after the top player available and in our case in our high evaluation of youth Depay was the bigges tsigning we could realistically achieve. Its similar to what GMs say in the NFL draft that regardless of their positional need if they feel like the best player in any position is available at the moment of their pick and they judge that that player outweighs the best player available in their positional need they will always draft talent over need. This seems like a similar case where Depay was available he showed some interest we had a chance so we went for it.

4007210,0,t1_crcwbis,Suarez did have a release clause the main issue is that even when theyre watertight theyre basically unenforceable because of the way the law works in the UK. If Arsenal meet the release clause and we still turn them down then they cant do shit about it. Its ultimately a contract between LFC and Suarez so theres no grounds to file a lawsuit because from a legal standpoint theyre a rd party to the contract and its none of their business. The only person who can file a lawsuit is Suarez except the whole process would take several months all the while his career would be in limbo and its possible during that time he wouldnt be able to play for either club and its really debatable whether itd be a positive thing for his career at that stage even if he won. There was some stuff about Suarezs release clause maybe not being watertight but either way it would have taken him suing the club to force a move to Arsenal and FSG were fairly heavily banking on him not wanting to leave quite that badly.

If Sterling releases his agent and tells the media he was influenced then every one can say he was just a dumb kid that got taken advantage of and he has the ability to now mend his image.So I guess I just have a different perspective.

Youre absolutely right. ,LiverpoolFC,crint5t,3,t5_2qn0o
4056499,0,t1_crinswb,You need to find some perspective. When Rodgers took over the club didnt regress we stayed about where we were in terms of league position but showed signs that we were improving. Then last season happened. It was a complete anomaly youre right. But your interpretation of it is devoid of all logic. It shouldnt be used to support an indictment of Rodgers it should be seen as an impressive season from a good manager to beat the trend. We pay th most in wages in the league our squad is about the th best and we will likely finish around where we should. Given certain inhibitory factors like losing Suarez and Sturridge a poor transfer window short term at least and given what I have said about our relative quality I think this season has been completely acceptable within the context of where we are as a football club. Am I happy that we are where we are? No. But do I have enough about me to realize there is more to it than just blaming our manager? Yes. People seem to want an easy fix and think sacking the manager will give us that but the sad reality is that we are not a th place outfit. Holding Rodgers to the standard of the miracle that was last season is ridiculous. And youre going to do that then youre going to be perennially disappointed. ,LiverpoolFC,crio6a9,5,t5_2qn0o

4062926,0,t3_373m86,i feel like rodgers came to liverpool at the wrong time on two levels. on the first level hes not experienced enough and despite being a talented manager still has many things he has to learn. In ten years time Rodgers will probably become extremely good but he hasnt reached that stage yet. I think even the most ardent rodgersout fans will acknowledge that you cannot fluke the two incredible unbeaten runs we had last season and in the middle of this one and even the most ardent supporters of BR will acknowledge that he has some serious flaws as a manageron the second level the modern era and the modern big club fan expects immediate gratification and success. honestly besides Mourinho im not certain if any other manager would have pushed us to challenge consistently for top  after  seasons considering the squad BR started with.ten or twenty years ago or at a smaller club I dont think rodgers would have been written off as a manager after one poor season. he would have been given time to learn and grow as a manager. but clearly modern fans at big clubs want the worldclass manager and the accompanying results now. one poor underachieving season and people call for your head. Me personally Ive grown accustomed to Liverpool not having much success after supporting the club for ten years. im perhaps more patient than the average fan and im okay with giving Rodgers time to learn and grow as a manager at the club because I see his talent as a manager and I think he is the sort who will stay with the club for a long time. I want Liverpool to be that kind of club who has faith in talented playersmanagers gives them the time and space to grow and reaps the rewards eventually.But im speaking for myself and my opinion is no more valuable than those of others. Some people think that modern football is so cutthroat that we cannot afford losing any time for a manager to grow and develop. Some people see Liverpool as a big club that should have a worldclass manager at the helm and should settle for no less. I just think that similar to Andre Villas Boas BR is a flawed but talented manager but unlike AVB i dont think he has made the same mistakesAVB crucially lost the dressing room that warrants firing him.,LiverpoolFC,crjei8w,4,t5_2qn0o

4066697,0,t3_375b9f,Thanks for laying all this out. I think Ings and Milner will be good signings if we snag them both. I have no doubts theyll perform and wont end up like JovanovicCole. Ings may have injury history so thats a concern but Milner is Hendersonreliable. The hardest part sadly is getting the best out of some good players Borini Balotelli Lovren Enrique who may still be good enough for us in a different systemwith a different manager and figuring out what to do with the others Aspas Alberto. There are also established players who may be moved on like Lucas Toure. Our priority has to be to sell players first especially the ones that arent going to start any games regardless of manager like Lambert Borini Aspas. Im unsure about Coates Alberto and Ilori. I expect them all to go out on loan again. Manquillo wont stay if BR stays I reckon. Problem positions are going to be up front and in defensive midfield Im sorry we need an old fashioned dynamic enforcer like MaschMomo  Lucas does not the legs have. Then its RB and GK. We would have finished th if wed had either a world class goalkeeper or Danny fit all season. With both it would have been comfortable. Im not saying we can get a world class goalkeeper and there arent many leftavailable but look at how much Lloris saves Spurs who have a poorer defence than we do on paper or De Gea carries United and you can see the difference it makes. Im not sure Sturridge will ever recover from his injury proneness but RvP and RvN did it before so anything is possible. Still I think we just need someone like Ings in if we are confident about Sturridge and cant unload the others. Hed get on great with Couts Lallana and Henderson considering hes a far more mobile version of Lambert  instinctive clever feet clinical.Im just worried about the lack of tempo in midfield and up front. Its cost us so much this season not being able to control games. Thats not down to tactics  you need a player or players who understand gamesmanship and we are lacking a lot of that in this team. Only option is to buy that. ,LiverpoolFC,crjtys8,6,t5_2qn0o

4202854,0,t1_crzb6w7,Exactly. They were supposed to be. Doesnt mean they were. I think ings is a decent signing. I feel that we were often forced to play sterling up front because he offered pace and was willing and able to close down defenders which balo and lambert couldnt for one reason or another. Ings can do that he better suits our system if and when we need a striker off the bench or in the case of injury. He is faster than the options we has this season and a harder worker.

That also means Ings or Origi starting regularly unless Sturridges thighs become magically cured.

In fact that is utterly irrelevant to Clynes market value.. I suggest you take a look at the going price of other young English talent with massive potential and many suitors . million is a great deal for us even after acknowledging his contract situation. He is in high demand and therefore Soton retain some bargaining power since they know clubs will still have to outbid the others. I maintain that they could have got  million more quite comfortably if they made the right moves and that would have been a much more appropriate price for both party for the reasons stated. With the inflation in the transfer market today after CL winnings premier league TV revenue and the ever increasing reach of the premier league we are seeing massively inflated transfer prices.

A simple google search of him shows that he says hed stay w Lyon if they got CL which they did. Wed be taken for a ride with Wanyama. Theyre inevitably losing Schneiderlin so theyre going to make it tough for anybody who comes sniffing for another of their midfielders. I also think hes overrated by a lot of people.

Hell hit home runs alright. They looked like athletes so they got signed but didnt always convert on the field.The moneyball idea was to ignore that subjective observation and compute a variety of stats and challenge the notion that home runs Im oversimplifying were a viable metric for player performance. Getting on base became a more important metric. Which makes sense in baseball. If youre never on base youre never going to be able to score a run.

Necessary for defensive cover but that doesnt help our attack. Defense doesnt look terrible though. A bit solid. Gomez looks pretty good but Id say he definitely is raw as well.

Just because you want to find fault with him doesnt make your wild claim of some hidden Balotelliesque behavior any more credible. Even more likely BR doesnt like him and is still bitter about the transfers the committee pushed on him.

Unless your assets are worth more than the company itself they dont come into play. So I would think it does not matter that Tottenham is in London.Looking at this Income Statement for Liverpool you can see that the operating result EBITDA for  is . million GBP while their net debt is . million GBP. Tottenham are much better off because while their operating result EBITDA is only  million GBP their net debt is . million GBP. A negative net debt means they have enough cash to cover all their debt plus some extra.Obviously Liverpool has the capacity to generate much more revenue but being so in debt drives down a valuation of the business. Now that Tottenham has plans to build a new stadium their debt will rise and they wont be as well off financially until they can begin to reap the rewards of increased matchday revenue.,LiverpoolFC,cub1sri,3,t5_2qn0o

4946072,0,t3_3in882,Positive  Teixeira will stay and Teixeira will play.  I reckon this is the reason.  He rates Teixeira more than he does Lazar and he wants to ensure he gets the playing time to go with it but doesnt want to let Lazar stagnate as a result.,LiverpoolFC,cuhzqey,-2,t5_2qn0o
4949052,0,t3_3inrui,Bit of a strange article it kicks off with insight into a footballers feelings within a transfer window then goes to to discuss what they might get up to during their time off and the boredom they encounter. Which doesnt really have any relevance to the transfer market.On the subject of boredom though instead of visiting bookies and brothels a lot of players you hear of during commentary on TV seem to study. For example degrees and Masters. That seems like a better and more productive way to use your free time rather than cheat and gamble. I guess that wouldnt be seen as cool though to your peers especially being a young footballer.,LiverpoolFC,cuid9iy,4,t5_2qn0o
4949239,0,t3_3iooj4,Disappointed hes gone out on loan. At least he might get some playing time that isnt at wingback though. People have been constantly shitting on him in the other threads but hows he to prove himself when hes forced to play out of position and given a task not suited to him at all in a new league. Hes had some good games for us and was hoping hed go on to play more and improve this season. Seems BR has made his mind up on who gets given chances and everyone he didnt sign either has to play amazing or gets frozen out. He surprised if we see him back at the club. ,LiverpoolFC,cuie3wt,3,t5_2qn0o

4950596,0,t1_cuik1v5,Im not gonna pretend I know anything about the Swiss league. If Sion is a good cup team so be it but yes winning twice against Sion will be crucial. No games in Europe are easy every fan has seen some shit like Celtic beating that godlike Barca team. Still id reckon Sion would be in real trouble if they were to perform in the Premier League and british cups. Granted Liverpool has struggles in that area too. Nevertheless these games will be for Liverpool to prove they are too good for the Europa League. If not then maybe that will be very telling for our squad. It might come back to bite us in the ass. Maybe we get smoked but evaluating before the games the draw could have treated us much worse. Imagine getting Dortmund and Fenerbahce. ,LiverpoolFC,cuik8ri,2,t5_2qn0o

This makes me question FSG as they knew for  that the fans the most important component to any football club wanted BR out after that Stoke loss.

It was a dumb move to make the contract talks public and try to use the media to pressure him into signing the contract.With Balotelli the club have the power if a player is not conducting himself professionally they should fine him and let everyone know. That puts pressure on the player but it is pressure to straighten up his act. Its not like a contract which is something personal if you are getting paid to do something you have to do it or face consequences.And its not like it indicates he was fined by the club or suspended privately it seems like they acted indifferent when he was doing it and then acted angry after he left. ,LiverpoolFC,cvbh18y,3,t5_2qn0o

While he has not managed in any of the big  the Dutch league is still decent and he has won it  times and has managed  Champions League games.

That  vs Arsenal Gerrard kissing the camera at Old Trafford  against Man City on the Hillsborough anniversary SAS Kolo smashing the ground with his fists lol the goals against Norwich all of them  with Suarez captain in everyones fantasy team ending AVBs career in England and on and on.Id hoped that  was a blip. Balotelli was the wrong choice for our system and we took too many expensive punts on the wrong players Lovren m! Markovic Lambert Lallana. Maybe if Sturridge hadnt been broken we wouldve achieved a bit more  but I found the season erased a lot of the goodwill hed earned in . I really really hoped it would be different this season. But it seems that he just couldnt find a system that worked. Defensive solidity has been a problem for his entire tenure. Why are we always scraping past teams in the Capital One Cup? Why is Emre Can STILL at rightback? Why do we ALWAYS concede from defensive mistakes? Why arent we trying to give the Europa League a proper fucking go?I wish hed succeeded. I hate that he didnt.

It seemed like we really had made a turn for the better and we did it without having to resort to spending frightfully large bags of cash like Chelsea and CityThen Suarez left and we gradually slid back into ignominy.

Suarez is a great example of a player who was durable and I think that greatly contributed to why he was so successful. He was able to get into a groove and just flow with the rest of the team. Sturridge can flow with the team but it will help the rest of the team midfield especially if they play consistently with the same man up top. I know Benteke is injured now and was out for a bit last last year but other than those  instances unfortunately recent he has been healthy.

I went to sit next to him and said Congratulations and anything you need I am always there.It was a relief for him that I took the decision okay.

Also the players only agreed because they had more chance of success in a Utd shirt than an England shirt so they were more concerned about keeping in Fergusons good graces than the F.A.s.Its unlikely but if Klopp can give us a realistic shot at meaningful success every year the players will suddenly become open to the idea of throwing sickie to miss a pointless game in order to increase their chances of winning something.,LiverpoolFC,cw1r357,3,t5_2qn0o

5460341,0,t3_3punqq,Have had this discussion in another thread. Corners should not be anywhere close to a priority for us. They are not good scoring opportunities and we are not as bad at them as people make out. Yes its fustrating when the ball doesnt get over the first man but ultimately that is all it is. It isnt holding the team back. In fact if you look at our conversion rate over this season we are just below average Benteke goal vs. Bournemouth  Ings vs. Everton.From the book soccernomicsThe data show that on average about . of all corners thats  in  led to a shot by the team that took the corner within three touches of the ball. . . Of the corners that actually led to shots within three touches what were the odds that the ball crossed the line? . . . On average about  or  in  shots created from corners produce goals. Incidentally thats also right around the average ratio for goals to all shots taken in soccer matches the Reep ratio. . . The yield from corners ranges from  to .. On average the data show that a corner is good for drumroll .... . goals. This means that the average EPL team scores  goal from a corner about every  games. And this helps to explain the lack of a correlation between the number of corners and goal scoring. The infrequency of the goals from corners combined with a lack of dispersion between teams in corners per game lead conspire to make corners mostly well useless when it comes to scoring goals.In short there are far far bigger concerns than our corners.,LiverpoolFC,cw9lze9,40,t5_2qn0o

Coutinho Lallana Milner Lucas Clyne and Can have played a lot of football and I want them healthy for Saturday. Moreno probably also deserves a rest but Im not sure who I would replace him with.

When you spend x amount of millions on a CB you will try to use him more as he is one of Rodgers big buys. In the end it seems like Rodgers kind of went against the transfercomittee using Lovren instead of Sakho when Sakho was injury free. But one thing that Sakho have not been for a long time is injury free. For all we know Sakho did not really fight hard enough to get his position back.

5845809,0,t1_cxlupdw,Perhaps I havent watched enough of Allen to be certain of his positioning. Ive just felt theres something not quite right when hes played as DM. Maybe its just down to him not having had a chance to get any sort of form going in last few seasons due to not getting game time when fit and getting injured when he finally does get a chance. Last I remember him getting consistent game time was his first season at Liverpool where he was Liverpools best player for the first few months before injury.Not quite sure where I was going with that...

5853504,0,t3_3vepuc,Just my opinion here but Rodgers was trapped by his own tactics.  He was very big on ball control and passing it up the pitch.  Invariably teams would have time to get back and park the bus.  Rodgers never figured out how to score against that.  He also tried to protect his defense so as soon as the team lost the ball they started backpedaling.  Invariably they would make a mistake or get beat down the field and give up a goal.  Despite their significant possession time they could only score a goal due to their problems with defenses that were set.  End result .The players seemed to figure out that what they were trying to do just wasnt going to work and their effort energy and body language just got worse and worse.If Rodgers is going to be successful somewhere else he is going to have to figure out how to turn his possession offense into a scoring offense without Suarez.But yeah the talent level was obviously there.  Its funny but Rodgers got praised for his tactics and bashed for his talent acquisition yet the reality might be reversed.I also kind of wonder if part of the reason why Klopp was willing to jump to Liverpool is if he knew that the team was ready made for his tactics and he could turn it around quick.  You have to admit the number of quality attacking midfielders really fits his  concept.,LiverpoolFC,cxmx7xf,4,t5_2qn0o

5871293,0,t3_3vojg7,I have to say that Klopp picked the wrong starting eleven and tactics today. Lucas and Allen were very alone in the midfield and could have benefited from us playing a formation with  instead of two.Firmino and Benteke who both have played some good games individually are not good at playing together. They are too slow and do not really run in behind. Benteke was really bad today. Firmino did just not look very bothered.Lucas played a really bad game especially with the ball. Allen played horrible. Sometimes it felt like we played with ten men because he was hiding.Ibe was our only creative force in the first half but lost his confidence as the game went by.When Sturridge and Origi finally came on we ran out of ideas and started to play long balls. Ironically Benteke would have been useful then.Lallana was the only player who tried to show something when he was introduced. He should have started.,LiverpoolFC,cxp9axj,26,t5_2qn0o

5878697,0,t3_3vsbfl,Hes not clicked with the squad yet evidently but Im by no means going to write him off for that early on in his time here. Hes had niggling injuries a change of manager and a change of team in  months and is still our top scorer which isnt too bad all things considered. Klopp has talked about Benteke and compared him to Lewandowski in saying both were different than the usual striker the team was used to linking up with and it showed in Lewandowskis rather lackluster showing in his first season with Dortmund. Klopp has said in England strikers arent given that chance as theyre crucified unless they come good immediately. I do believe we need to be more patient as Benteke has impressed me with his ability to create goals out of nothing something all top strikers can do. The variety in his goals here after a few months shows us the variance goals hes capable of but its just clicking fully for him yet. Hes a different option and will hopefully be more utilized for certain games which require a more physical forward. Probably Pulis teams and the like.Having other options in Sturridge Ings and Origi means were not needing to rush him in to being prolific we have other options and he is still scoring goals for us anyway.

Errors leading directly to goals save percentage crosses punched successful claims these have little to do with how poor your own defence is. Goals conceded however has everything to do with how poor the defence is which is why I didnt bring it up. Saying the first bunch of stats is a reflection on our defence is akin to saying a striker having a bad ratio of goals to shots taken in the box is the rest of the forwards fault. My contention is also that if you put a better keeper behind these very same CBs they will play a whole lot better. I dont think United have the worlds best CBs even though Smalling is solid but they are so good defensively as a whole also because theyre simply playing in front of a damn fine keeper who doesnt make obvious mistakes stops a high percentage of shots and has strong command of his box. Its a little like being in a band as a singerguitarist and not trusting the drummer to stay in time it throws off your rhythm if you have to worry about your keeper being bad at things that can only be his domain.,LiverpoolFC,cxzp1ti,6,t5_2qn0o

He can draw players to the club who can take us to the next level. Come January there will be a couple of additions and minor tweaks in preparation for an overhaul in the summer. It is no surprise to me that Klopp is giving everyone a chance to prove themselves before then and during that process we will both destroy teams and lose badly as we did today. It is the process of transition and understanding. Klopp is a manager not a miracle worker.

He plays in a league nobody watches and is a far better alternative them him playing in Europe yet some people still felt personally offended.

6095046,0,t1_cyi7ltp,Ive been watching him closely. Sure he has the odd hollywood pass in him but is incapable of creating space in the middle of the pitch. Watch him next game all you will see him do is continually wall pass with our defenders. He doesnt pass it forward like Henderson does he cant deal with being pressured and has a poor first touch. I feel like Im going insane reading how many supportive posts people write about Can and it feels like Im the only one that can see how useless he is. Part of the reason why I feel Sakho is struggling is because he doesnt have a reliable CM that can ease the pressure off him it is on him to create chances and ping the ball into the feet of the AM because Can sure as hell wont do it.,LiverpoolFC,cyifzsg,1,t5_2qn0o

He got a foot issue which randomly goes away with time and in between that broke his foot. So I wouldnt call him injury prone yet. Go back  months and he was widely believed to be someone hard to injure.

Its a way to press right after you lose the ball so that you have it again when opponents are surprise and not structured yet. But in the end it is just a way to have the ball again. And when you have the ball on your feet you have to do something. That something part is the part that Klopp and his players havent managed to do well so far.

He has pace you cant argue that and we are in need of pace as of now. Ibe has exactly the same pace he can beat a man but then just makes a poor cross or sends the ball to a goalkick its incredibly frustrating seeing him giving away the ball almost all the time.

I feel like Migs is suitable and Klopp wants to put a defense in front of him that can adequately deal with the ball.  The first goal was certainly his fault for not covering near post.  The second I cant fault him for.  The placement of the deflection was like a body serve in tennis...not much you can do.  Third one was our CB allowing a striker to turn far to easy like Firmino almost did against arsenal for his hat trick...I say get a solid commanding defense in front of him and then the complaints will certainly be quieted.,LiverpoolFC,cyyas79,1,t5_2qn0o

6322193,0,t1_cz898sr,Ill rephrase what my point is. I thought I made it clear by the countless examples I gave and the fact I keep saying primarily.I think we should sign a player that is primarily a winger who sticks wide and has a lot of speed to beat his man as opposed to a CAM who can play outwide. Think about how little Lallana offers on the wings he rarely crosses and can barely get round his man. His ball retention as brilliant but his actually product is not great. I strongly believe we are better off getting a player that is more suited playing outwide than one that can play outwide but is better behind the striker.  ,LiverpoolFC,cz89ii0,0,t5_2qn0o

Probably a top class defensive midfielder top class central defender if we havent sewn Matip up if we have then all good keeper and winger.I think we then have to decide on Benteke if theyre happy with him then great.

6446397,0,t3_43y17z,In general I think all of these discussions regarding our club the squad the coach etc. etc. and all the varying opinions really highlights the complexity and the challenges that our club faces today.I think its good that people want break down these complexities and simplify them but I think people often miss the mark.And this post is an example of that.The OP states that Klopps form in the past  matches is  points out of a possible  with a  goal difference.That certainly is food for thought.And my thought is that the OP has posted this simply to generate cheap reaction from the masses andor that the OP has not really thought through the important question of why we are the way we are.I think our form struggles because of injuries the players on our squad our transfer policy our coaching etc.And the reasons for those struggles are the consequence of changing ownership inconsistency poor decisions on top of poor decisions....The why of why we struggle is too difficult to really get into without writing far more words than I have already written. Haha.But to get back to this argument... I also want to be able to simplify things just to be able to wrap my head around our struggles. And in terms of Klopp... heres what I see Klopp is widely acknowledged as a better manager than Rodgers. Therefore if Klopp struggles with our current squad then Id argue that our squad is the problem and not Klopp.OPs statement seems to suggest that Klopp should be able to do more with this current squad as it stands now.But if Rodgers struggled and if Klopp struggled ... wouldnt it stand to reason that its the squad thats the problem?I think it is.Ultimately its far too early to determine whether Klopp is the answer or not. But with Klopps experience and track record I think he certainly deserves a couple seasons to build and develop a squad.And by hiring Klopp I think the ownership will give Klopp every opportunity to succeed.,LiverpoolFC,czm3iw0,2,t5_2qn0o

6465041,0,t1_cznume3,gt because of YouTube highlights and statistics If thats what you base your knowledge of players on well done but some of us actually watch other leagues. Whilst I havent followed the Ukrainian league devotely I have watched a fair few games that Teixeira has featured in and it seems that he would really help with our creativity issues. Whilst its not guaranteed that a player can settle in a new league the other products of Shakhtar have done quite well in adapting havent they? Plus the fact that he can find the net often helps in what I can only describe as a woeful season in front of goal for us. gt the price they were quoting was fucking astronomical I havent mentioned anything about price. Maybe M would have been a bargain for him had he come good maybe it wouldnt have been. Im glad the club didnt just crack under the strain and pay it outright. The thing is every team not from the PL is milking as much money as they can for players now  they know about the TV deal the increased sponsorships theyre trying to share the wealth by charging extra. gt Why are you so convinced? Im not convinced dont think theres ever been a transfer you can be  sure will work.

6474466,0,t1_czoz1ld,The difference is if you gave Mertersacker pace hed be one of the top centre backs in the world. You can have all the technical attributes but not the physical ones or mental ones for example Glen Johnson never bothered to really improve defensively because he had enough pace so it wasnt really a problem then when he started to lose pace he became the John Glenson we all fear. I didnt say he couldnt improve. I said in my opinion I dont think he has the tactical awareness to be a top left back. He could become a good or very good left back until his legs start to go but not a top one. And in regard to the maths thing its not you can count or you cant its your good at maths and you can retain the knowledge or you cant and your better at other subjects. At  years old he should be able to handle basic positioning and not have to rely on his pace all the time. And your right I dont know his training and progress and personality but what I do know is that his lack of positioning leaves us wide open and fucks over the centre backs and it happens quite regulary. ,LiverpoolFC,czp0833,1,t5_2qn0o

Easiest to see in the Norwich game where he was pretty much at fault for the first Naismith goal. Aside from that he often doesnt keep his head up during dribbles which he tries to make too complex and loses posession to start counter attacks essentially THE thing one cant do as a central mid.

6531035,0,t1_czuu1bk,The Economists writer is arguing that especially in the last sentence that for financial reasons more revenue is needed to increase competitiveness and therefore ticket prices should go as high as the market will supposedly allow.For me that assumes that fans of all incomes or backgrounds behave the same which I dont think is the case at all especially when fan behavior seems so tied to socioeconomic status.Loud and positive fan support or the lack thereof definitely affects a teams home form and results. Given the other financial disadvantages Liverpool has by being in Liverpool which the writer does not bother to delve into the club needs to foster the most vociferous and support fan culture it can and that is something theyre undercutting by being so careless or undiplomatic? with the price increases.You may get more money in the short term by raising ticket prices but there are long term effects that should be accounted for as well.If the writer is not ignorant of that fact not addressing the important nuances that affects the products marketability still seems like an oversight to me.,LiverpoolFC,czuuzsf,-1,t5_2qn0o

6687743,0,t1_d0ayan0,Why? Hes only ever going to be a squad player at Liverpool. Hes got a great attitude and a great engine but limited actual ability. Hes not a better player than either Clyne or Moreno and if our aim is to challenge for the league and CL regularly were going to need to aim higher than what Flanno offers. Maybe hell surprise me and become more than I think he will but I think right now if you see Flanno as someone who is going to help us return to the top of European football you need your head seeing to.  Hes been out for a long time and the club have stood by him. Are they now to offer the player a new contract out of loyalty? The point is the club owe him nothing. Theres no point offering him a contract if he doesnt have a role to play and really only Klopp knows if he might at this stage.  If I sound harsh dont bite my head off. I love Flanno I just see him as a player with huge limitations. Hell have a good career but I think if he does stay with us itll be for another two seasons or so until he moves on to get more regular playing time at a midtable club. Disclaimer I could well be wrong here. I remember early on in his career nobody thought Carragher was going to become the player he did. He was also a player with huge limitations but he was smart enough and determined enough to play to his strengths so his flaws complete lack of pace limited technical ability didnt become weaknesses. Maybe Flanno will do this too.,LiverpoolFC,d0b2khf,14,t5_2qn0o

6724010,0,t3_47q63d,Very good performance but there were a few things I noticed that could cause us issues down the road. Neither Hendo or Can knew when to sit the understanding or awareness simply wasnt there. It was so bad that in the th minute the dangerman Bobadilla has  yard of space in front of our defence because both HendoCan look to press they are forward thinking it is not their fault but we need someone who is and more physical than Lucas.If we do this against City well get seriously punished. If we had more proactive defenders it wouldnt be as much of an issue but SakhoKolo sink into the box when under pressure. Lovren is good at it but we seem too deep as a team to squeeze the play when our press doesnt work.Milner was excellent so many times he covered for HendoClyne or simply made up an extra man in midfield. Really finding him to be a great addition perhaps even better now that hes playing for Klopp who I think prefers him out wide to Rodgers who signed him for the middle.I hope to see a  vs City because of our frailty centrally but it means moving Firmino and hes our best presser. I hope Klopp finds a way to include both Firmino and Sturridge.I had forgotten how creative Coutinho can be he makes a huge difference for us and if him and Sturridge are consistently fit we are very close to a top  side. Our finishing was really poor as good as Hitz was. Hendo should have scored his he was like  yards out. Reminds me of how he couldnt even hit the target  vs  against United. We still lack goals as a squad makes me so envious of Spurs with Alli who is showing more goalscoring ability in  top flight season than any of our central midfielders have in their entire careers.I think Benteke should be sold while his value is still high. Another season on the bench will do nothing good. Hes a good player no Balotelli his goals have proved it in such a poor side but hes just not right for us. Origi is already ahead of him and Ings will return. We can use that money on a wideman who can finish.,LiverpoolFC,d0etkdi,16,t5_2qn0o

6758174,0,t1_d0iaej1,I entirely expected the results to be the same if not worse.  what I most liked about Klopp when he came in was his attitude his lack of bullshit and his ability to see where the problems were.  He is also great at calling out media bullshit.Think about how many unlucky results weve had this season? How many nearlys?  Before Klopp can make the players better he has to make them THINK they can be better! thats why whiskynose did so well because their teams knew they were winners! all our boys dont have that ruthlessness. All the problems weve had are ones we had under rodgers which were never fixed.  Its no surprise to me that we are in th.  Klopp needs a least another year to get any kind of footballing culture in place.If you want anyone to blame for this blame Rodgers or the transfer comittee or the players themselves.  Moreno has been here since august  he has had far more time to progress his game than Klopp has why not go after him?  Bringing in ward was a response to bogdan and mignolet.  Klopp likes working with young players and turning them good. Its entirely possible Klopp thinks ward is hiis goalkeeper next year.  Caulker was as a result of injury as I said before Klopp doesnt like the january transfer market and we didnt need fantastic cover as we have center backs but they were all injured.  Mignolet may not have been his choice and it is a questionable decision but Klopp doesnt write the contracts. Out of all the bad players I think mignolet has progressed a small amount.   Again that deal was problably in place before klopp even got here.Tactically.  We are somewhat unorganized in defence but again as I have said before Klopp hasnt had ANY time to bed in tactics or strategies for players.  Moreno is still unreliable at best sahko is the best of the bunch but has been injured skyrtel has been injured lovren has been injured kolo is getting on in years the only one with any consistency is clyne and he is short which contributes to the set piece problem.  How is a back four to train if they arent fit?Leads me to a bigger problem.  Most of our midfield and a lot of our front men have terrible conversion and give the ball away a lot.  We concede far too many goals because we give so many chances for the opposition to attack this comes from the sloppy possesion and lack of concentration that the players have.  This is as I said before not something Klopp can really change.  Hell come december Klopp was still getting acquainted with the schedule of british football.You cant say hes terrible at all you dont have that right or privalege.  He hasnt been here long enough to actually change anything.  He has to go from match to match thinking of formations and can barely get training sessions in because he is trying to keep players fit.    Most of your points about performance on the pitch are entirely true but are very cynical we have done a lot of things right. At the same time they cant really be attributed to Klopp the only thing he can really do right now is put players on the pitch and hope it works.  Im not even saying its all the players fault but its certainly not Klopps to any extent sometimes its just circumstance. I agree with you he will get better performances than Rodgers but he wont do inside of this year its just far too early.,LiverpoolFC,d0ico6v,2,t5_2qn0o

Hell seem to drift off for half the game then makes a killer pass which leads to a goal.  And he presses.  Coutinho and Lallana for all their industry dont provide as much end product. This is ok though. They help create the space which allows Firmino to drop into a scoring position or to see a gap to play someone into. His numbers speak for themselves.  goals and  assists in  league starts is actually bloody phenomenal especially seeing how inconsistent weve been as a team.  All the evidence shows that were more likely to win when he plays.,LiverpoolFC,d0tjg6i,1,t5_2qn0o
6862218,1,t1_d0u4980,Exactly. At this point its becoming harder and harder to justify the current balance between giving him game time to develop and the negative impact he often has on games. Can made some real howlers last season and at the start of this season but you could see continuous improvement every time he played and over the past month I would say hes been Liverpools best midfielder.

No matter the age if theyre playing week in week out and not playing well enough theyll be judged. That doesnt necessarily mean that he should be shipped off but we need someone better and Moreno can play whenif he has developed enough.My point is we cant be playing players every week who arent at the required level just because they might be one day. They should be rotated to get enough playing time to develop of course. ,LiverpoolFC,d0ukovg,7,t5_2qn0o

6867478,0,t3_49s6nv,Fuck no. If he does end up staying here itll be as a squad player. No he doesnt have a birthright. Nobody does.   Sure if a player is a key member of the team and has the right leadership qualities then I can see why some people might prefer a scouse captain but it might be worth asking ourselves why.  To connect with the fans? Well ok. But most Liverpool fans arent from Liverpool so that goes out the window. To keep a solid link with the city? I think this is valid and I think that someone who has grown up in the city as a Liverpool fan might appreciate the role more. It might mean more to them and that counts for something.  But really I think the role of captain is overplayed in this country. The manager organises the team and the best teams have leaders all over the pitch. What we want is a team of talented and intelligent players who all take responsibility when they need to. Sure for younger players this is more difficult and this is where experienced players use that experience to guide them. The captaincy is in the best teams more of a symbolic role.  For the record I think the most natural captains on our team are Can and Sakho. Can is too young and raw at the moment but I would rather have had Sakho appointed captain over Henderson. Hes much more authoritative while also being much calmer. How he didnt get the vice captaincy still boggles my mind. I think it just goes to show that unless its someone like Gerrard who literally carries the team and dictates how we play it doesnt really matter who the captain is in that it doesnt really afect the teams performance that much. Sakho and Can lead as much as anyone else on the team and they dont need an armband to ensure they do so. From  our most successful period we had five different captains Dalglish Thompson Souness Neal and Hansen. They were all radicaly different from one another and none of them held the role for more than two years except Hansen. The role was given to them largely because of seniority. Its like getting a watch after  years with the company. What that variety and turnover shows is that when you have a good squad who wears the armband has virtually no influence on how the team performs.,LiverpoolFC,d0uqmk6,1,t5_2qn0o

His tackling ability and determination make him a fun player to watch. Also he is a local lad which is very important to the club so I dont know why youre trying to turn him into a completely different player than he is.

Sturridge in his short time back has been more involved and scored a fair few goals almost as many as benteke. Origi has shown some really great qualities that are helping the overall team performances because of his ability to stretch the defense. Benteke has all of these qualities but he needs to buckle down work hard in training and show people his quality. klopp is always willing to have his mind changed but benteke needs to stay focused...not give interviews about how annoyed he is. even if he was asked these questions he should have refused to dive into the subject. ,LiverpoolFC,d1adrve,4,t5_2qn0o

This is but another example of Mamics influence unfortunately extending its reach from top to bottom.gt On September  Ante Cacic was named head coach of Croatian national team. Most recently he has been coaching Mamics club Lokomotiva in HNL  and has also coached Dinamo Zagreb. Many national team fans are not happy as they know Mamic will continue to choose the players for the national team as he did for both Stimac and Kovac.

Loved wearing jerseys but now since Im closing in on  I dont wear them anymore. Usually now its a club polo or tshirt here and there.But I still keep buying kits but now I usually buy matchissued match player spec kits to keep and never wear. Ive got a crazy collection of various kits from all these years. Last count was close to . I just get player autographs and retire them. Built up a respectable collection so far so I got that going for me. The plan is to eventually have them all property framed and make my office or future basement a bit of a personal memorabilia museum.But the funny thing though. All these years of going to Anfield Ive never worn a kit to a match but the last time I went I went Full Kit Wanker. ,LiverpoolFC,d2kk24s,3,t5_2qn0o

Why do you think Klopp left him on the bench in the first place? Ill bet any money you werent around for our CL days in the s. Welcome to European away fixtures. Your way of thinking is incredibly naive and is exactly what cost us in the end. We won a CL got to another final and a Europa League on the back of  away legs playing in exactly the way we did today. Why? Because you always back Liverpool to pull through at Anfield on a European night. Klopps mistake was bringing on Benteke at all and looking to win it instead of continuing with a strategy that was clearly working. Villarreal were not there for the taking. They are a counter attacking side playing at home where they beat Madrid and Althletico this season. We should have taken the result that we had. ,LiverpoolFC,d2l8m2f,1,t5_2qn0o

Villarreal seem like a decent well organised side from the few games Ive seen of them this year not counting last night because I thought they were poor last night which is why its such a missed chance so I think well struggle next week.

Theres hope that Firmino will continue to develop and LallanaCoutinho will be quality squad players but no better imo.

7656740,0,t1_d3ci1tm,I think you hit the nail on the head for our team as a whole  decent. We have a lot of good players but few that can really push us to better things. So its hard to really put the finger on the weak link. I almost wish we had a shit player we could blame it all on and replace. But weve got a team full of players that are good but just not quite good enough most of the time. Im torn with a lot of players. I know Henderson is great when hes fit but is he really good enough considering our ambitions? Im willing to give him this upcoming season to recover and really step up. Well see if he really is quality or if hes more of an Allen kind of player. I think Can is good enough or at least has the potential. Hes only  and has far more good games than bad.Im starting to have doubts about Coutinho. I know hes only  but  appearances for Liverpool and hes still so damn inconsistent. Every now and then hell score an amazing goal but it comes after several games of very little production. Lallana. Hee really won me over with his work rate but no matter how well he presses his poor finishing and often poor choices in the final third make me think hes not good enough to start for us.Milner. Consistent. But simply not good enough IMO at least not to start. Ive given up defending Moreno. He will do anything to avoid actually defending. So idk. Do we sell a few players to finance Gotze and a quality DM? Do we play a formation something like this?

7690560,1,t1_d3gcvkz,No thats not true. He was playing some amazing football at the beginning of the season for Bayern and then he got a groin injury against Ireland in the Euro qualifier and then it just heavily impacted his fitness to get back into things. And at the point when he was healthy enough to come back the team was already well settled in with the tactics and team chemistry that throwing Gotze in would disrupt all of that. Now that theres a new coach coming in I think Gotze wants to give himself a chance to prove himself at Bayern once more before going elsewhere. Itll probably be a mutual desire from both Bayern and Gotze to make this work out mainly because Gotze is still a highly talented player and him going on free could be something Bayern may regret.,LiverpoolFC,d3gd8e6,2,t5_2qn0o

7726155,0,t3_4l4o3k,One thing you brought up and is discussed quite often is our inability to hold leads. Some blame it on lacklustre performances from the players and some blame it on the lack of appropriate subs. While the first point is definitely valid I think the issue may lie in the lack of variety in our players. When were leading the one area where we falter in the most is midfield. Last season we had a midfield of Can Milner andor Allen for the majority of the season and an attacking mid trio of Lallana Coutinho and Firmino. When were in attack mode this is fine because it is exactly how we like to play  quick onetwos and dribbles. When were on the lead and need to defend however the lack of size in our midfield gets exposed. Other than Can  we dont have anyone else in the squad that can win a duel. Weve seen Klopp swap out Firmino and bring on Allen but he does not provide anything different other than some fresh legs. The other team just lobs the ball up our midfield cant win the duels and they get to start their attack from our own half. Now lets say we have the likes of Grujic Zielinski andor Dahoud available in the bench. If were in a pinch bring one or both of them on and that negates the other teams tactics of the lobbed air balls. With the pressing of Lallana and Milner were going to be hard to beat through the ground. It really covers our ass alot better of we can have that physicality available in the bench should we need. For example against Sevilla NZonzi and Krychowiak wrecked us because our players simply could not out muscle them in the park. Same story against Newcastle. I am really hoping the midfield signings will add another dimension to our defence other than just relentless pressing because well its hard to press when the ball is barely on the floor. ,LiverpoolFC,d3kerbo,6,t5_2qn0o

Lucas can cover as fifth option but even though I love the guy I wouldnt want him to be thirdfourth CB.  CDM deep lying playmakers are becoming a bit of a clich solution to problems imo but we sure could use one. Center midfield lacks creativity. Can is a great player but not of that calibre that he should be starting  games a season at his age nor is he a number  imo. If we would be in for a regular number  I think Sven Bender would be an option he isnt an option for Tuchel at CDM only as a CB but he hasnt gelled too well with Sokratis.  CM if we buy a classic number . Some creativity.

8117383,0,t1_d4sgfpc,Completely different as I understand Agger had come to Rodgers regarding play time because the team was statistically better with him in the squad than on the bench and there was a general falling out between the two. Agger also said that he felt under appreciated and confused because the team had done fairly well when Agger was in and had personally good games.I also seem to recall that there were discussions about what he could do to get back in the squad and things that he specifically worked on to do so and he felt he had improved on but then he kept being overlooked come time to pick the team though some of that was probably paper talk.Agger added that he thought that Rodgers was an incredibly talented manager. You cant take that away from him. Hes good in the way he trains and he is clever in the way he sets the team up. Hes an extremely extremely competent coach. The things that went wrong between us is that I say things the way they are and I expect others to treat me the same way. Maybe it is wrong to always expect this.Thats the way to leave a team with grace things arent working out but you dont call your manager a dick because you werent getting played and rightly so in Martins case.The headlines were all sensationalist as they always are Agger hits out at former boss Agger cites managerial rift Agger complains Rodgers made mistakes etc. in order to sell papers but in reality Agger recognized that the writing was on the wall and decided it was better for everyone if he moved on.,LiverpoolFC,d4sgtdi,10,t5_2qn0o

8219065,0,t1_d531wjq,Ah but heres where youve gone astray I havent called someone an idiot for choosing a logical outcome. Ive called someone an idiot for confidently declaring Ibe would be as goodbetter player than Sterling. On the balance of probabilities this is not a logical outcome. The logical outcome again based on the probabilities was firmly in the Sterling camp. Its one thing to believe in a player and to wish for him to succeed and I certainly was proIbe in that sense that shot in the Everton match had my trouser dowel fully at attention. Its another thing entirely to believe in a player and just know that hell become great to the extent that you think losing a star playerstarter in Sterling is not a problem. And thats exactly what these morons argued. I could have gotten behind the well this could provide room for Ibe to grow to his potential which maybe is as high as Sterlings. I absolutely vehemently disagreed with the shortsighted imbeciles who failed to apply logic at all to the situation took what was a small but hopefully probability and treated it as a certainty. You may think it destructive to call a spade a spade. I certainly do not. This is not an invitation to criticize Sterling for his formperformances.

Can Henderson and Milner all like to go forward but are quite good at their timing and are not forgetting their duties while guys like Allen and Lucas can hold that space quite well. Not sure if Wijnaldum is that sort of player and honestly I think wed be better with Joe. Although I assume he wanted more play time and Klopp just couldnt promise him that.

I hear a lot of people saying Its just this team and Its still preseason so it doesnt matter but this preseason feels very sound defensively weve won all of our games so far this preseason and kept clean sheets in all of them which cant be said for other clubs. Weve also got a head start on a lot of the other clubs as weve had a head start and even though Chelsea City and United have been buying bigger I think weve been buying smarter and well have less of a bedding in period as Klopp was our manager for  months. Last year we conceded goals to Malaysia XI Brisbane Roar and Swindon Town. All of those were shit teams but we still conceded to them.Thats getting beside the point of Matip though.

8499455,0,t3_4w46yh,. How do you think this season will go?Liverpool FC hasnt had the best of years and the color red is starting to become synonymous with heartbreak. So my undying raise the LFC flag to the top of the pole optimism has taken a few hits and Ive had to temper my overconfidence with a bit of reality.That being said were going to win the league. There seem to be enough weak points in the top teams across the board to make the top  nay  nay  a competitive challenge with Man City being the only real team that seems a safe bet to win the whole thing. But Jurgens got Peps number and when Klopp understands a team he knows how to bust them apart.We have enough depth especially at midfield to allow for injury fallout and internal competition. Many players have adapted to the gegenpress and the new talent both from the youth academy and the transfer season all seem to be the right fit for Liverpool. Even a bold move like leaving a pricey wage burner like Benteke out of your plans shows that Jurgen has a clear vision as to where this team needs to go.And for me thats all the way to the top.. Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?Can I say none? And I mean that in an extremely positive way. Wijnaldum is going to be a work horse for goal support and kicking in an extra  for the season. Mane has already proven himself to be the perfect  up top. Studge is going to have himself a monster season and seems more determined than ever to be the breakout scorer in the EPL. But watching preseason and the way the team syncs up to me recognition has to go to good ol Millie James Milner. Likely to be shifted to full back he could be what Alberto Moreno always should have been. He can distribute he can disrupt play and he can cross with the best of them. We will see Sturridge dance we will see Firmino pose heck we may even see the Lovren Frowning Leap but it will all be because of the to that Milner will put in every single game.. How do you think the team will line up?This took me much longer than I thought it would.This WILL change. Karius is going to take Migs spot. A proper LB will allow Milner to take over for Hendo. The Wij will alternate with Lallana and Mane will alternate with Firmino and Coutinho. Sturridge will likely switch with Origi ever so often. And this is all AMAZING. Karius Sakho Klavan Brannagan Lallana Firmino Origi Ings Grujic and heck even the bright stars in AlexanderArnold Ejaria And of course Shamal George. All this incredible talent and I dont think theyll be in the starting  to kick off the season. They dont seem flashy and worldchanging but this is a solid strong team and they are going to fight their way to the very top.Cheers! YNWA.,LiverpoolFC,d63zf2m,1,t5_2qn0o

Flanno got beat by his man on the dribble more than any other player in the league or something like that in .Flanno was starting in a title challenging squad out of pure necessity and the incredibly low expectations we had of him made it so that when he performed anywhere above a shambles which to be fair he was more or less consistent in his level of performance which is a really big deal we praised the hell out of him.I fucking love Flanno hes one of my favorite players in the squad.

8613447,0,t1_d6i8bun,Oh Left back is definitely a top priority. I was just saying yesterday Moreno was not the only issue. Quite clearly he was the weakest link and was the first to give way  in that nervous first half. However what i saw from the rest of the team was far from satisfactory. Even if they were defensively quite good they did not control the game. Our dominance came from rapid unbelievable football. If you cannot control the game against a weak Arsenal you will not win against full strength teams. Plus Arsenal play a more open style similar to ours. Can we always rely on Coutinhos wondergoal to turn things around? There will be tactics setup precisely against that. Staying confident calm and collected would go a long way in ensuring top  this season. Klopp of course knows this and talked about adaptability to different scenarios.

8617030,0,t3_4xuekj,This article didnt sound like it was Tony Barrett. It was less reporting and more creative writing. Interesting point about Moreno being pushed further forward earlier by Klopp. I believe it to a degree. Hes the obvious candidate the be the outlet on the left as he possesses pace the Coutinho doesnt and hes typically pushed wide from the way we defend. With the first goal I dont think the blame lies solely at Morenos feet. He has every right to take off there if thats the system Klopp wants to play and I dont mind him gambling on Lallana being able to turn and move the ball forward. Instead when Moreno goes forward Id like to see the team adapt to his run much faster. KlavanLovrenWijnaldumClyneHenderson shouldve all slid across as soon as that outlet pass was played. Pick up his man so you can let Moreno run freely. But until that happens Morenos aggressiveness is a big liability.,LiverpoolFC,d6iq798,2,t5_2qn0o

There wasnt too much doubt in my mind that he was a good centreback and he would play like one for  minutes he would just have  minutes of calamitous errors seemingly every game. Morenos the exact same. Hes clearly a talented left back. Good going forward strong oneonone defensively pretty good on the recovery tackle and has all the physical skills but he just loses his head too frequently.

Problem is he clearly has a problem with not being a guaranteed starter and is making that known. If starting other players for tactical reasons is alienating him then thats where my concerns stem from. Also his fitness record shows hes not a player we can build the team around. In fact that would be incredibly naive on our part. ,LiverpoolFC,d6yxfd8,2,t5_2qn0o
8746414,0,t3_4zu6zj,I think the reason the result really sticks in my throat is because it was an opportunity to put the massive disappointment of the Burnley game behind us.Instead weve only come away with a draw which yes is a good result away at White Hart Lane but still feels a bit meh. Also add in the fact that despite having a great win over Arsenal on the opening day were actually on exactly the same points as them. Weve lost our early gain over them this weekend too.Today it was a good performance yes but good is not good enough at this level for Liverpool. We were not clinical enough today which I believe was a direct consequence of not playing Sturridge.Imo if Sturridge had started we would have won today as we would have been able to capitalise better on our solid first half performance. We could have gone in at half time  up rather than .Still it is very early days in the season but weve had two games in a row were we have not been clinical enough ignoring the Burton game of course. Fortunately we do have a solution to this through Studge and I think he should start our next game which is at the Fortress.Weve had a funny  away game start and I think that when we get back to Anfield our season really kicks off.

8746966,0,t1_d6z0fpw,Wrong. A team that is not very strong in any aspect of the game is going to sit deep defend and try and hit on the counter. If you give them an early lead at their home ground then they have no reason to try and get anyone forward against a team that they know are much better than them.If you dont give up that early goal theyre far more likely to try and  get up the pitch rather defend with  players behind the ball.,LiverpoolFC,d6z0wt7,2,t5_2qn0o

8768165,0,t1_d718dp8,May be a bit late of a reply but that to me is a little more acceptable than what Moreno was doing.  Watching Milner do his best at that position by providing some semblance of what Moreno did while looking like he honestly is learning from his mistakes is a lot better than watching Moreno.  Moreno kept making the same mistakes and it never seemed like he put in a proper effort to fix those mistakes.  Milner has a lot lower upside than Moreno but at least he looks like he is trying to get to the level of defending necessary to play left back without getting shit on.  I do agree that he didnt make an improvement because at Burnley he wasnt tested enough to warrant any major contributions to the mistake cesspool that was our defense.  And of course he is out of position and of course he has that long way to go to get any sort of quality at that position.  But for a patchwork leftback he isnt shitting the bed like Moreno.  Hes just going through the learning pains most teenage leftbacks experience.,LiverpoolFC,d71oncz,3,t5_2qn0o

Yes we have incredibly fast players who would probably put John Terry on his arse in a normal game but this was never going to be a normal game.Conte knows very well that Liverpools weakness is breaking down teams who play deep. We have however improved lately I would expect Chelsea to set the line as low as they can and play deep thus potentially exploiting our weakness and also addressing the issue their defenders would have against our pace upfront. Terry set to miss the match is therefore good news imo. Now they might even consider taking a different approach to the game which I think will suit us better and if not be assured that Terry is way better than Luiz if they decide to lay deep and compact.,LiverpoolFC,d7l2pou,2,t5_2qn0o

Since this loss I have made it my personal mission to beat Genoa wherever possible. Fifa Football Manager PES This is football World of Sensible Soccer... I will always play and beat Genoa. Whenever I play FM as Liverpool I have a yearly preseason against them and I would take a loss in a cup final over a loss against these fuckers. Spurs  My stepkids dads family are all Spurs season ticket holders and they revel in it when Spurs are decent and were not yet they are strangely quiet when the boot is on the other foot.

Sturridge with his quality and instincts that got us  goals Origi playing out of his skin and Anfield falling in love with him again Ings running like a maniac and having a decent chance. Non of them are starters thanks to Firmino who is not even a striker but is brilliant at it and deservedly is one of the  or  undroppable names.We cant shoe horn more than one of them in because that would mean dropping Coutinho or Mane or playing the old  which would mean dropping Lallana or WijnaldumCan.This thing with the depth is weird to me.

Arguably Costa too since Batshuayi hasnt shown any quality so far and they are dependent on his hold up play. Without Kante their midfield is back where it was last season and if they lose Hazard they have no creativity. Just Pedro and Willian running down tunnels. On our side it is perhaps only  Mane and Firmino that we cant really replace and weve got results without Firmino such as over Chelsea. Difficult to say with Mane since the Burnley game was so strange but I think if he was out we could play Firmino on the right and Sturridge inside and it would work weve improved against sides like them.However they are also out of the league cup which will help them.,LiverpoolFC,d9ei2ek,1,t5_2qn0o

Consider him to be someone who does not like to hurt the team structure like that in the middle of the season because it unsettles a once established pecking order and roles in the teamI do believe however that he might look at a winger on loan. Somebody experienced that was usurped by a young hotshot during the course of the season so far. Cannot think of anyone but i deem a deal in that category much more likely.Personally i think we will play with lallana instead of mane and get canhendogini in midfield. If Klopp is forced away from these obvious choices he might go back to firmino on the wing and origi or sturridge in the centre.  If all that fails ... there is ojo or even woodburn eager to get some life changing minuits on the pitch.Our depth is majestic up front. Sure we want that pace upfront.

His whole style made him so elegant yet unpredictable and he could destroy the opposing defense from anywhere... distance calm and clinical close finishing he was a beast in the air he could do it himself or he could use his brilliant movement and let others find him for the easy finish.

9742885,0,t1_dads5y1,But he was the focal point of that team. Its like saying Messi isnt actually that good because he had better players with him. The general consensus seems to be that Kenny is the best but I do think you could argue that Gerrard is Liverpools most important player. Becausw without Kenny we would have been a lot worse off but as you said players like Rush Souness were there and Liverpool would have still found some level of success. However in an alternate universe where Gerrard gets released by Liverpool at  Im not sure where Liverpool would be but I would reckon a lot worse off perhaps they wouldnt have won a single trophy in the s without Gerrard.

And its hardly like Sakhos behaviour was the worst bit of petulance weve seen in a player this season. I feel like we often forget that while he did contribute to the drugs issue he was a victim too at the end of the day UEFA being wrong. This couldnt have helped his mindset. Hes only human. We put our players on a pedestal and if they slip up just a little were ruthless use the media to force them out etc. And then we cry when players arent loyal. Sakho didnt hit anyone bite anyone drive drunk assault his girlfriend make homophobic statements refuse to play for the club etc. He made a mistake in taking medication he should have asked before using and then goofed off during preseason. Hardly something we need to destroy him for. End of the day hes never getting a chance again and hes gone but it feels like people here take the clubs justification as gospel. Of course theyre not gonna say maybe we should have supported him a bit more because that makes them look bad. Theyll just ring up Pearce and leak him some rumours. I can see why Klopp is doing it  Im not questioning that.

9851733,0,t3_5geqpg,Seeing as every comment in here is from people that are pro Can Im going to go against the grain and say I dont really rate him that highly. Most of the comments say look at how old he is  hes so good for . I have no doubt he will get better and  by the time he is  he will be an extremely good midfielder  but the amount of hype he gets on this sub is infuriating. Hes not this god footed German beast everyone keeps raving about not right now anyway. Hes good but he makes a lot  of mistakes that people just put down to his youth  which is fine but every time it happens dont act like hes the second coming of Jesus and it was just a once off thing.His physical attributes are second to none and his creativity with his cheeky balls over the top can undo defenses but he makes more mistakes on the ball and gives away possession in dangerous areas more often than a deep lying playmaker should for me to consider them a weekin weekout starter. My highest rated comment on rsoccer is from saying he looks like someone who just holds down the R button on FIFA and sprints into the  corner every time. Its comical how many times Ive seen him do it and run out of attacking options because he takes so long to release the  ball.He has had some bad games for  us and I have seen many times in match threads on this sub people questioning why he hasnt been subbed off. Just because you dont agree doesnt mean theyre wrong. Is he the future of the club? Yes he is or  at least he will be in a few years but please for the love of god its tiring seeing  marry me Can or Emre is god every game.

Chelsea dont have any long servingfan favourite players but yet here they are with one of the best defences in the league at the minute. They dont have a problem seeing out games yet. Its because they are organised and most importantly havent shown any signs of complacency. Obviously its still early and I believe the problems that lead to our defeat the other day can be fixed without the need of some mythical leadership figure.

He is playing at a constant level this fall the end product just is not there individually because he plays too creatively for his own good and is best utilized as a team.TLDR best example is he is a team player.

He is still the same player from  years ago. Still makes head down runs takes forever to pass horrible at short passes can be lazy tracking back. He is great in other areas but he has not improved at all in his weaknesses. And please dont talk about the Villarreal game. I hear it as an excuse all the time. One game shouldnt be an excuse was balos  game against Spurs used as an excuse? the dude is the exact same player we bought from Bayer. I also think he is facing backlash from this sub due to how much Can spam there was in the offseason. Lots of people wanted him as captain lol. I think Gini fits our midfield much better. We already have  attacking players we dont need .Im also fine with Gini not taking risky passes like everybody loves Can for. We push so many people up that a poor pass which can is keen too can lead to a counter really easily.

I think both goals against Burton he scored inside the box so he was not on the wing in this moment  that is flexible football. ... That is how football works it is not a fixed position where you stay outside and wait until you get the ball  especially not in Daniels case. ... We dont have these positions any more where you say You play this all the time it is normal. ... We have still to work on a lot of things. I know him and when we have talks there is no issue.Thats not saying he does not want to play him in the Manespot he just dont want to play him as a traditional winger which we do not deploy anyway since our FB provide the most witdh and or on a fixed position.The only way your claim stands is if you eliminate the context like it is done in reporting all the time.gt On playing out wide Sturridge said I am not saying I am happy to do it I am saying I have to do a job for the team.Consider the following more elaborate article on the same matterThere are lots of quotes that speak a different language there. To sum it up i would quote Sturridge You cant play the same as if you are a centreforward. Everything is different. ... But when I go over those white lines its important to give . I am not making any complaints its football. ... It was nice to get the victory against Burton and it was a good game to be involved.After saying this the media went on a Sturridge is unhappy about playing wide or feeling fed up about beeing played out of position ,LiverpoolFC,dbi30lz,1,t5_2qn0o

I felt like he looked dejected and the way he spoke made it seem like he wants whatever minutes he can get but he isnt delighted with where he is at. It can not be easy either. Almost everything in the media talking about how he lost his spot to firmino and origi has to be weighing him down. Even his first goal of the premier league season this year was pointed out to him in the interview as a gift. Feel bad for the lad but at the same time I am happy with how we are progressing as a team so I can not say I feel bad about the entire situation.

10138359,0,t1_dbszwwo,gtYou mean  right?  against Arsenal  against Bournemouth.  Yeah  lol.gt   Ive heard this kind of excuse a lot Ive made it myself in the past but I no longer think its a good one. If anything its a damning statistic that for the past  seasons or so if we concede  or  goals were liable to capitulate and let in a couple more.I didnt make myself clear.  I meant that it happened in  matches.  Its such a small number that you cannot use proportionality to calculate our expected GD.  We could have  of those matches again over the next  games.  If its  or  it changes the expected GD massively for example.  What can be derived imho is that we will not keep clean sheets when we are cruising having scored  goal.  Something which we have been doing time and again.  And as shown in the clean sheets its not really worrying long term....gt You could argue that Arsenal havent won the league in so long because they have a similar tendency.Another fallacy I found out while looking at the stats.  Arsenal have consistently finished in the top  teams with the most clean sheets in the last  years.  They had the most along with United last year with .They had this clean sheet issue between  and  where they finished th or worse in terms of clean sheets.   The worst being  where they finshed th.  Its just a narrative without any basis nowadays which sticks to them.  Hilariously their problems has been scoring goals consistently far outscored by the top .  Only  last year for example the same as fucking West Ham two more than us even though Rodgers couldnt buy a goal to save his life.

Benteke was a star player available and we bought him just because of that. Mane wasnt the biggest star but he was the right player for us to go for.

10260378,0,t1_dc7255y,So you would buy Promes for M in order to play him when Mane is injured but if that doesnt happen he wont get a game? I dont even think Promes will contribute more than Sturridge or Origi on the wing even though its not their favorite position. Also that essentially means that Sturridge and Origi will struggle for game time even more than before.  Why not just wait until the summer until Klopps first choice targets are available because Origi and Sturridge and Lallana are good enough to cover for Mane in my opinion.  Im not against even if that might be your impression but there is more to it than just Mane is gone for a month and we need another winger because he might get injured. ,LiverpoolFC,dc72ius,1,t5_2qn0o

Were not that far away we could even win it this year but as fans weve seen us go close before knowing that an additional one or two players couldve pushed us over the top but we just didnt have the money to compete. Now we apparently do have the money but have made a profit on Klopps dealings. The cycle of go close to the title key player leaves for another club club has to start again from further back than we were before has happened more than once so frustration on the part of some fans is perfectly justified in my opinion.,LiverpoolFC,dcezl1h,2,t5_2qn0o

10482809,0,t3_5q4zbt,On paper Can gives us more defensive stability in midfield than Gini and that is a clear issue with our midfield and is very important today because if we concede the first goal then we need  goals without conceding again. The keyword is paper Can has been in poor form hopefully he has a good game today but I can see why he was picked over Gini if we had prime Lucas he would be perfect for today but we dont and our only other defensive midfielder is Kevin Stewart he really isnt the type of player to rely on for a league cup semi final Can is the next best thing provided he has a good game.Interesting to see Sturridge get the start over Origi neither have been great as of late but Sturridge is definitely getting chances to prove that he should be starting for Liverpool if he doesnt take them then thats on him. He has the ability to win this for us hopefully he does. It will be a shame if he has another anonymous game and puts his future in real doubt but he has to take these games and prove he can still have a role at Liverpool he had some great performances earlier in the season against Leicester and the sub appearance against Watford even if he didnt score in them even if he just has a game like that he will be important.

Instead of trying to whip crosses in from the touchline or if youre closed down and play the ball back to the central midfielders to try again on the other side try squaring up and attacking the fullback. Commit their defenders and pull them away to open up spaces in the box so we can play quick crosses on the ground from closer range.Manes done that for us all season and on the other end Lallana is great at recognizing those situations and popping up in the resulting free spaces.

So while Scholes might have gone a bit under the radar when he was playing it became pretty apparent how big of a part he was in the glue that held United together back then since. With Gerrard we always knew what we had because outside of the odd player for a couple of seasons like Suarez Xabi Alonso Torres in his prime and Owen in his prime Gerrard was always the best player on the team by a significant margin.

10663119,0,t3_5s97xq,I honestly dont see why people are mad about the season so far. We are a mid table team who punched way above our weights. Rodgers in  i believe signed  players which was great for squad depth but not great in terms of quality and long term vision. It took forever for the players he signed to fit in. When you sign  or  its easier to fit them in the team. Klopp seems to be taking a pragmatic approach to liverpool. I believe the owners have put no pressure on him to get results because they want to build something. The pressure should start to come in the  season. So klopp is patiently picking the right talent with the hope he has the squad he wants not next season but the season after. which gives him time to mold the squad. In the mean time he needs to get the best out of the current squad so that it becones easier to add talent.My view is that carragher is failing to see the bigger picture i dont blame him it must be frustrating to have to wait. Klopp is not an idiot. He knows that the best way for liverpool to play is to hold the press until the opposition is a bit further from their box giving the attackers room to move which is how we pressed last year. But the reason he does not change tactics is because he needs his team to dominate possession  and wants to win the ball as close to the oppositions goals as possible.  the only way forward is to rinse and repeat until you get it right.  It might also explain why he subs so late. He needs his first  to dig the team out of trouble. Its hard but it does wonders for the teams mentality. All this is a risky approach but if it works it would be really great. We can only hope we make it to top . But i am  sure nothing will change in terms of tactics for the rest of the season. Im okay with that so as long as next season we can have a longer run of form than this season. Besides this season is not over.,LiverpoolFC,ddftibp,1,t5_2qn0o

10691688,0,t1_ddhxcff,It is likely that it hasnt made much of a difference at all. Newtons law is still in place. Sure the balls might be lighter but players are still smacking them with their heads and because of the fact that the balls are lighter they may be hitting even harder than the players of old used to. Also the thrusting forward of the head is probably causing some damage also. Even stuff like headbanging can cause neurological damage. Your brain isnt designed to move back and forth like that especially not that quickly. I think after all the necessary research is done there still wont be a way to fix the problem besides taking it out of the game which just cant allowed to happen itd completely change the sport.

10961420,0,t1_deajfv6,Agreed. In addition someone needs to tell Klopp to adjust his tactics. Im all for his system. When it works it works fantastically. But its so obvious there are games that we need to do something different to break down a team.,LiverpoolFC,dealcud,8,t5_2qn0o

10961568,0,t1_deakw99,I dont think it is players not playing for Klopp or Klopp losing control of the dressing room. I just think Klopp needs to rotate the formation to keep competition in the team like he does with Karius and Migs. Players like Firmino and Can have been playing bad and they arent getting rotated out. Can plays ahead of Gini sometimes but I feel Firmino is always in the Starting  even when he is in shit form. If Klopp rotates Firmino with OrigiSturridge the same way he does with Karius and Migs  there would be competition and everyone would improve. This is already proven  Karius played bad he got swapped with migs  Karius improved Migs started making mistakes he was swapped with Karius until Karius made mistakes and he was swapped with Migs again. And now Migs is playing way better than he was before.,LiverpoolFC,dealwm1,1,t5_2qn0o
10961619,0,t3_5wjpgc,The worst part of all this are the stupid regurgitated excuses after the game. Now its no Henderson. Before it was no Mane. Before that it was no Coutinho. Im just so sick of it all. The diatribe of Leicester were horrendous all year and now they show up comments. Maybe we should have a look at ourselves instead of at another team for doing their job. What do we expect? teams to just roll over for us?!I havent been a fan that long only since  but this is the worst I have ever seen over an extended period of time. Even under Hodgson we would string a few wins together. The team has been completely and utterly insipid and I hope it sends us as fans and Jurgen as manager a wake up call to the fact that this team will never be good enough. The amount of persistence with certain players Milner Lucas in certain positions has to stop. The emphasis on pressing which is clearly almost nonexistent half of the time we play has to stop the fact that we play Firmino up front for the work rate he offers is damning. This club was better off with actual strikers playing up front. Rafa could get us playing well without this press and system we seem to worship. Too much is being sacrificed for a system that will never work without the absolute perfect players which either Klopp cant convince to join or the owners wont back him for.No one is bigger than the club and I honestly fear for Klopp. I love the guy to bits and dont want him gone but questions will be asked if this form continues to the end of the season and unfortunately I and alot of us cannot see any way to improve the performance level.,LiverpoolFC,deam3fd,9,t5_2qn0o

What preparation would have been involved here? Does Klopp not instruct the players during the match? This isnt a Skrtel situation  we used to always object to how he didnt trust himself and would play people on or sit too deep.

11031370,0,t3_5xilf3,Firstly obviously there were a lot of standout performances but this was one of Cans best games this season in my opinion and the first time he Wijnaldum and Lallana have worked as a midfield three. Before today he never looked agile enough to operate in that number  role that Henderson usually occupies but today that didnt really seem to be an issue. Hopefully Henderson will return soon but if the three play like they did today then we may not miss him as much as we have done up until now.Secondly it definitely helped that Wenger dropped Sanchez but I thought playing two recognised experienced centre backs helped us enormously. As much as I like Lucas and the fact he has been a great servant for us I dont feel comfortable with him starting at CB. Klavan has his flaws but so does Lucas and I think in games like these the experience of Klavan will trump the passingtechnical ability of Lucas. Thirdly it was great to see Firmino and Mane on the scoresheet again. I know Monday was absolutely horrible to watch but at least Coutinho scored then and after today all of our dynamic trio have scored this week so hopefully this gives them the confidence to push on for the rest of the season. Finally if this season had happened in reverse and by that I mean starting poorly like our post new year form and finishing strongly like we started the season then we would all feel extremely positive towards our top four chances. After all that was our aim this season and its is still in our hands. I have faith in Klopp and the squad. We can do it! ,LiverpoolFC,deidpnf,3,t5_2qn0o

The change in style of play is the biggest change for me. Under Rafa it was so safe and dour people remember the good times but we lost that title because we werent brave enough to attack with abandon. So many draws so many s.... I would prefer the way we play right now its exciting and any new fans watching will love the way we play. We need a striker just one top top striker and we are set....

11303256,0,t1_dfbvv2l,Think the issue people are ignoring is how much Klopps press demands of a creative player like Coutinho whos main attributes are not just recycling possession Gini or dispossessing someone and starting a counter Lallana and Firmino but finding pockets of space and breaking down defenses as in this clip when they are already set up.He was good at the start of the season but so was everyone. Rising tide carries all boats and all that.Im not sure Coutinho has the legs to perform consistently in a style like Klopps.

I dont see illegal streams necessarily having a big impact on attendances in the lower leagues just because even if theyre easy to get these days theyre still not as convenient for most people as Sky Sports . Is someone living in Northampton or Brighton or whatever necessarily going to skip their local game to bother with rsoccerstreams or whatever to tune into a random PL match being streamed online as much as they would if it was part of a Sky Sports Saturday triplebilling of football?

11513538,0,t3_64cfzb,Hey guys. Today Id like some of you to look at yourselves. This post is not meant to bully anyone its just sometimes hard to grasp that people choose to be so negative when they can be positive. After yesterdays Liverpool match I felt physically sick of this subreddit. So I made some screenshots to present to you. Many of the comments are now deleted. But please look at yourselves and compare to what was being said after the second half. Firstly it was clear that Klopp had chosen such tactics not because he likes sadomaso but simply because of the circumstances. And as you can see his tactical choices have totally worked out. Secondly Klopp has already done an incredible job. Want proof? Imagine what if we played like United or City after having spent insane amounts of money? Or Look at Arsenal. But no weve spent very little and play better than both United City and Arsenal we are rd in the league with only  matches to go. Has it often been like this? Finally lets stop judging the players when they make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. One day Origi is a hero next hes shit. One day yearold Woodburn is wonderful next hes shit. Lovren against Everton is amazing with Lukaku in his pocket now hes shit whom we have to sell. Mignolet was shit for so long now hes great but will he not be shit next match? Lets stop this. In my opinion goalkeeper and defender positions are the most difficult ones. First of all the defenders and goalkeepers mistakes are the easiest to see second of all its hard to defend because the opponents constantly try to trick you and even if you dont get tricked the entire match you can just get bad luck. Why arent we talking about the unused  chances Lallana and Firmino had? Theyve had a lot of those and they failed to do their job just like the other players. And that lost us points against City Southampton etc. But everyones only giving them praise. So lets stop judging our players and instead try to support them. One thing is perfectly clear to me Klopp is the best thing thats happened to Liverpool in many years. This year we have defeated or tied with all of the teams in the top  in all of those matches we have been the better ones out of the last  matches weve won  times against Arsenal Burnley Everton Stoke and tied twice with City and Bournemouth. Is that really so bad? It is clear how rapidly this team is growing. It is also clear which positions need to be improved in the summer. Weve signed a new contract wit h Coutinho who is great shape and according to the press had been close to moving to Barca. Have we often managed to keep our best players? Has it often been so that those players love Liverpool feel happy in the club and actually want to stay? Even when the richest clubs try to lure them with money and almost guaranteed trophies? Lets learn to value what weve got. One of the first words Klopp said as Liverpool manager were that We must turn from doubters to believers. Lets try to better understand what he meant by that. Because we are incredibly lucky to have such a manager everyone in the football world envies us. Everyone loves Klopp so lets not be those who love him the least. Yes I too sometimes fail to understand why he makes sub s so late in the game but it doesnt mean that I have to call him shit for that. I simply know that hes been in this thing for a long time and all I can do is try to understand and not judge. In my opinion Klopp still doesnt deserve anything but praise. And his hugs are some of the best in the word lucky are those who have received one. Klopp is an amazing person and only then an amazing manager. He is smart honest incredibly passionate and he does everything with his heart. He passes it all down to his players and that is how mentality is being built. So lets learn to be positive. Be positive be believers be like Klopp! Peace. ,LiverpoolFC,dg127q1,4,t5_2qn0o

11783131,0,t1_dgv7njm,Henderson Lallana Wijnaldum and Can should all be rotating next season. Obviously we should have a concrete starting XI but if injuries were to happen and when we get European football wed ideally want four solid players to play as attacking mids. Hendo puts in a shift at DM but I think Klopp amp co. need to think about putting in a DM similar to Kante in that position. Kante isnt flashy. Also two of the biggest complaints against him is that his passing is a bit off and he could do better with his forward runs. But Id forsake those two things if it meant that wed have a DM like Kante gluing our midfield and defense together.,LiverpoolFC,dgvnmpb,3,t5_2qn0o
