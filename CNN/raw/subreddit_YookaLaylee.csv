3873608,0,t1_cqxlkwh,Yeah but in at least Axiom Verges case all random factors were kept the same across speedruns via the same seed which Id see as a great boon to speedrunners no? Idk how much of that if any this game might contain but in the event that it does removing that factor would be good.While I agree that cutscene skipping should be a feature in most games idk if thats a common sentiment so including it would still be good.Also why use an external timer if its unobtrusive and accurate via counting elapsed frames rather than elapsed time? I can see why you might not want splits clogging a whole section of the screen but continuing to use Axiom Verge as my jumping off point splits were shown when they were broken but not constantly up on the screen so theyre still there at least in part.But yeah Im sure people will speedrun it regardless.,YookaLaylee,cqxtoss,1,t5_381ui

Combining this with inverting y axis means I can still zoom out the camera whilst I play. Overall I prefer this fix since I can now turn left at the expense of being able to zoom the camera in.

11368040,0,t1_dfkj920,I also like titles such as Inside the spiritual sequel of Limbo and other indies. Personally I wish that they had not offered stretch goals. Stretch goals are advised by outside marketers when developers consult them so I believe that may have factored into their decision to include them. The idea is that when people see a singular goal they go Ah theyll make that they dont need me. But when there are more goals they feel innately as well as instantaneously a need to give their money. So yes I was comparing them with these other titles but in the sense that I have little time to give to YookaLaylee and in its current state I dont know if Ill want to. The levels seem pretty sparse and the platforming doesnt look very intricate. I hope when reviews come out that Im proven wrong regarding what Ive seen so far. ,YookaLaylee,dfkjn6n,0,t5_381ui

11593446,0,t1_dg9cxus,A big theme with problems people are having with certain challenges in this game is I suspect a misunderstanding of mechanics.Not going slowlystopping at Rampo or Gloomy Gem.

11710059,0,t1_dgncatx,Talon trot is a lot slower than the reptile roll makes Kazooie a permanent part of the sound effects and you cant talon trot through enemies instead you just get hurt. Also the power meter is a nice balancer to ensure that running around as Yooka is something you actually do. In fact if there is one big issue with BampK its that Banjo feels so irrelevant and useless compared to Kazooie. Seriously Banjo as a bear basically has no abilities of his own besides treading water swimming underwater is surprise still done by Kazooie...I mean he can attack but his attacks are just unspeakably awful compared to just pecking thing with Kazooie. Tooie sort of improved this giving Banjo like the ability to grab and sidle along ledge for example but its still not great.Not sure what they mean by double jump since you could do that in BKBT. However if they mean the super jump I can understand. Banjo had a crouch jump but its super awkward as you enter a weird almost slow motion backflip that feels all kinds of wonky. Banjo also had the jump pads but those were context sensitive so you could only do it in set areas it wasnt something that actually improved your natural platforming abilities. In contrast the little spring jump Yooka gets feels a lot better and can be used wherever you want it to. Making it a natural improvement to your platforming abilities. ,YookaLaylee,dgnd58p,15,t5_381ui
