620608,0,t3_21959h,This is a calypso cover of KingLeiberStollers Spanish Harlem most famously sung by Ben E. King.  His version is very mellow orchestral pop from  but it does feature a Latin baion beat and marimbas in the arrangement which may have inspired this version.Not sure what artist or recording this is but you may be able to isolate it by lookign up cover versions of Spanish Harlem.,NameThatSong,cgatb4j,3,t5_2svj1

3548456,0,t3_30xqhe,So me and girlfriend were listening to some great songs from the noughties the other day and she asked me if i remembered this song ? she then excitedly hummed the tune to me and I immediately knew the song she was trying to rendition ! We both hummed it together in passionate nostalgia and were both really pleased that we both knew this song .We then discovered that although we both knew the song neither of us knew the name or artist and so it is driving us both crazy! so if you consider yourself to have a good ear for recognising lacklustre humming attempts at songs then please listen to the short video and post if you think you know the name.thanks guys!,NameThatSong,cpwqw5c,1,t5_2svj1
