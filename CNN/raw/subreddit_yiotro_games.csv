10665189,0,t1_ddeupo5,Yeah I was in the same situation once Obviously its a players mistake. Its easy to leave  hex free so units can march through it. I am not sure yet maybe Ill let players to destroy their own farms but this would just make game easier. And its already quite easy.,yiotro_games,ddg17bl,3,t5_3iwya
