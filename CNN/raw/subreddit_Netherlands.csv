5926569,0,t3_3wil9d,. This depends on the Uni of course so dont take my word for it. General policy  a definate no allergies but at my campus at least if you dont report it it doesnt get punished so most people can have pets as long as there are clear rules with the people with allergies.. I would not. You probably cant find a parking spot large cities are reachable through train and driving in the city is a nightmare.. In Amsterdam it is pretty doable with the tourists I think its a little harder in Rotterdam but it should be doable. It is a lot easier if you speak Dutch obviously but not required.,Netherlands,cxwi62p,2,t5_2r0ol
