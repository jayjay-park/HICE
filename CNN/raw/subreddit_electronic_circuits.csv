1788857,0,t1_ck4lbqp,first of all thank you for the reply. If i stayed simple variable resistance input sensor gt controller gt display no inputs talking to each other would you then just recommend the stm? or stick with your last point about the arduino?on the amp draw these will be measuring  amps  vac that change anything? When i measure with my meter its by clamping it around the wire induction??? could I just wrap an insulated wire around the big wire? can milliamps be an input? Am i talking out my rear here? I may have some horrible misconceptions. Accuracy is a relative goal... amps deg F GPM gallons per minute dont have to be to decimal places. Also will be using the illustrious imperial scale for ALL measurements as my country rightfully demands!,electronic_circuits,ck4my6g,1,t5_2rp97

2666162,0,t3_2qj6i3,What do you mean by inverter? Thats typically what turns DC into AC.  You can use a linear regulator to drop  to ..  A voltage divider doesnt regulate itself and isnt very temperature stable.  The power dissipation in a linear reg is the drop multiplied by the current.  So   .  .V if current is . then .  .  . W.  Many regulators can handle that and worst case you put a heat sink.  If you want less heat or more efficiency you can buy tiny switching converters fairly cheaply.    The linear regulator will need at least an .uF ceramic on the input and output to stabilize it.,electronic_circuits,cn6lcdj,1,t5_2rp97

4495421,0,t3_3cl6vi,Yes it can be done.The easy way is a microcontroller if you can code. For Arduino sample code is out there. Slightly harder is a smaller micro such as a PIC or ATTiny.As hard would be logic.,electronic_circuits,csxb016,1,t5_2rp97
4642643,0,t3_3ekchf,gtIm trying to find a circuit design that can allow me to use a V W bulb on my motorcycle which originally used a V W bulb.You need a boost converter. They can be had from ChinaeBay for well under . Check the specs. Needs to have an input that goes down to V and a power handling capacity of at least W.gt There are many simple schematics online for voltage doublers but I have not found one that can handle the current that I am dealing with. If these are capacitor diode arrangements they are for creating high voltages and inappropriate for this application. gtCould I design a circuit based off of an existing schematic using higher current rated components or would it be better to design a circuit from scratch to meet my requirements?You could but prebuilt modules abound. ,electronic_circuits,ctfrrr0,3,t5_2rp97
4750496,0,t1_ctt9sgg,Those arent contacts. You ripped off the metal and are left with the board itself now. Repairing this is tricky because you have to glue on the connector and find other places to connect the pins of the connector using wires. for the middle one you can use the curled up copper bit and also connect the bit left on the right side of the pad otherwise parts of the device might lack power. For the bottom one you can carefully scratch off some of the solder mask of the ground plane it was connected to. The two uppermost pads will be difficult though as there are no traces visible. As JamesIsAwkward pointed out you may find traces on the other side of the board but they can also be on some hidden layer inside the pcb. With a dmm you could probe and try to find components that where connected to the battery and use those pins to solder your wire onto. For probing try to find a pile of components that could be a dcdc converter visually recognizeable as a circuit with a bunch capacitors and inductors and not the thinnest traces.,electronic_circuits,cttcfni,1,t5_2rp97

6006680,0,t1_cy6t485,No no .. you cannot use ICs  in parallel for it!In theory their characteristics are the same. In practice they are not. One of them will take most of the current and them it will burn. A is a high current. You will need some switch like an IGBT.I had to develop a boost converter for a wind turbine once and was forced to use an IGBT far as I remember. Now I work with industrial motor control and the inverters use IGBTs.Industrial inverters use IGBTs and their currents are like  A.Also had to develop DCDC power supplies. Far as I remember IRF could take up to A HOWEVER it is not safe to use it at its maximum current.,electronic_circuits,cy708tk,1,t5_2rp97
6121019,0,t3_3zd3ua,I always check the datasheet to see what the mfg recommends. They usually give a minimum value and indicate if you need a tantal or a electrolytic. If the mfg says you cant use a ceramic I usually do it anyway but I put a series resistor in there as well. Just an ohm or two.  Actually I just put a series resistor in there whatever the datasheet says. ,electronic_circuits,cylea37,1,t5_2rp97
6124639,0,t1_cylmj8c,Well.. Its a bit more complicated of course but thats generally true yes.  All capacitors have parasitic resistance and inductance but ceramic caps have less of both. Less resistance due to the material its built from and less inductance since they are usually in a smaller SMD package.  One disadvantage of some ceramic capacitors is that they are voltage dependent. That is if you apply a dc voltage across the cap close to its rated voltage as you measure the capacitance the measured value is lower than the stated value. This is where the different types XR CG etc comes in. This is mostly a problem for ceramics with a high capacitance. Usually you can ignore this but if you are running into problems it may be worth knowing.  Im mentioning this voltage dependence because its the only major drawback with using ceramics that I can think of.  I do a bunch of electronics design and when I need a capacitor i first think of ceramic caps. If I need a really large capacitance gtuF or I need a moderately large cap but Im also going to put a high voltage across it gtuF V then I think of electrolytic caps. Edit this is also why people put two or more caps in parallel one electrolytic cap for those high micro farads and a ceramic for that low series resistamce and inductance e.g. for filtering away RF noise,electronic_circuits,cylt34m,1,t5_2rp97
