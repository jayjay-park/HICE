11459947,0,t1_dfuxx7h,I second this. Also the E for me is usually the Support button. Threshs Lantern or any of the above shields or the supportive cc like Poppys and Alistars. Its just a thing for supports and similar.,RakanMains,dfuz79i,1,t5_3jvax
11655521,0,t1_dgh5ed8,It is extremely helpful! You can chain your gap closers to surprise people and land chain charms into W. For example R gt E gt W and if your W lands behind their team and they get charmed they are guaranteed to get knocked up. You can look at it as if it was an improved version of Shen E with a knockup at the end.,RakanMains,dgh61y5,2,t5_3jvax

11670616,0,t1_dgiu9ty,Rylais isnt that good on burst champs  ex. Veigar and annie. Due to the recent changes its for dot champs like brand and viktor. With full ap rakan youd want to one shot with one rotation,RakanMains,dgivp0u,2,t5_3jvax
11679000,0,t3_66m541,I usually take three points to Q in the beginning to make it not so useless and then start maxing E. Having three points in Q at level  is a nice amount of damage and heal in the early trades  level  fights. Just make sure to hit that Q during the knockup duration of W.,RakanMains,dgjtxqf,2,t5_3jvax
11684398,0,t1_dgkffnm,Ah youre right. My mistake. I still dont think he procs it frequently enough though and hed need to proc it even more than others do to get good value out of it because hes still getting half the effect by being ranged.,RakanMains,dgkfzih,1,t5_3jvax
