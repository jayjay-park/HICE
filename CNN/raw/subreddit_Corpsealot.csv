1902081,0,t1_ckhysfi,You know I dont know if thats true but I agree it seems that way.  I really think Chris Roberts has an idea of his perfect flight sim and the more money he gets the closer to that dream he can get.  But after a while you need to reign in the features to make a stable product.  I am not that worried about the game in its current state it is still alpha.  I might just pick up Elite now and then SC later when its closer to release.    In regards to the procedural generation Roberts did say they wanted a more hand crafted experience and will only use it for certain things.  Its definitely not fully procedural so their initial vision hasnt changed if I readheard him right.,Corpsealot,ckie16z,2,t5_2zcue
