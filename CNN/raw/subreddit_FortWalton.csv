2984774,0,t3_2ubcd1,There is a horse farm near Lewis Turner and Hurlburt where you can get free manureits outside of the fence where you shovel and haul yourself.  Be warned I used this last year and basically killed an entire garden box for the year.  Since the stuff is fresh it takes a year for it to breakdown enough to be used in a garden.  FWIW this year Im doing great! Hope this helps.tldr  Free manure at local horse farm that cant be used right away,FortWalton,co7daob,3,t5_2slhs
