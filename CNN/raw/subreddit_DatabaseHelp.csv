2474564,0,t1_cmh4qgu,Ah okay this makes some sense actually. Now Im assuming that since the tables already exist then the CREATE TABLE commands wont actually work right? So I guess I could have done . the whole time.Thanks a lot!,DatabaseHelp,cmhk9yn,1,t5_2w4oz

Ive seen queries in SQL Server produce different ordering due to The presenceabsence of a NOLOCK query hint yes Im well aware that its a bad idea  working on getting a vendor in line Parallelism settings MAXDOP amp Cost Threshold for Parallelism  and in this case its not even consistent between executions of the same query youll potentially get different ordering for the same data amp same query each time,DatabaseHelp,d2a9emb,2,t5_2w4oz

If it is you could either manually enter it or obtain it by querying the game ID and sorting the users by score.Youd get the total points similarly by querying the games table by user ID and summing their score.Its would likely get more complicated than that but thats my basic thought at the moment.,DatabaseHelp,d3jip8e,1,t5_2w4oz

There is certainly a solution that can be purchased and configured to your requirements.Something on this scale should not be attempted by a single developer with no prior database experience. Its a recipe for disaster.,DatabaseHelp,d43q2rz,3,t5_2w4oz
8891567,0,t3_5218g5,Since youre a selfproclaimed noob this might not even make sense.  If its me I use a SQL Server instance to store the master data.  I use SSIS packages to read all of the spreadsheets when they are updated.  Later I convert the inputs on the spreadsheet to having those accepted via some SSRS reports on a central server.  If these are sales folks that need a local copy occasionally then they can download the report or an export in Excel.  This needs to be hosted on something like an Azure SQL Server VM or locally.  SSIS can also use Excel as a source and destination so you can automate the update of the master.  However in the long run this will be a lot maintenance compared to what Ive suggested.,DatabaseHelp,d7gn25i,2,t5_2w4oz
9709014,0,t1_da4hgih,Okay.  In regards to your last paragraph how about having foreign keys in table? That wouldnt known as redundant data would it since its being linked from another table?A bit of background. We were given two forms of staff and volunteer data then a sample report displaying fields which we may incorporate in our DB. Parents no table currently for just borrower table which I would have to create new record in Volunteer and Staff can all loan books Volunteer and staff have own tables but not sure how to link to Borrower table then as lookup or something else?. So only Parents Volunteer and Staff can loan. A staff member library admin then processes the returning of the book. The borrower table currently will incorporate staff volunteers and parents which there is currently no table for  do I create one?!. The borrower can loan multiple resources at the one time. The loan table currently are fields keeping a record of the specific loan of a resource that a person has taken out.This information might help you to clarify some things. Im still trying to think how far I am off getting it right I seem to be hitting a wall each time I try.Thanks.,DatabaseHelp,da9uezz,1,t5_2w4oz

And once an order has been made youll need to take everything from the cart to the order and order details tables. And then a payment table will come into play. ,DatabaseHelp,dbsya9n,2,t5_2w4oz
10622943,0,t3_5rzxd7,It doesnt if you connect directly to a database from clientside code then any user can steal your database credentials and do whatever they want with them. Thats a very bad thing.You need to have some sort of serverside code that handles the queries and passes the resultant data back to the client. This is commonly written in JavaScript Node python ruby PHP c java... and is likely where much of your programming work will be done.,DatabaseHelp,ddboc6s,3,t5_2w4oz
