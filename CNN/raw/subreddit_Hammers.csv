4796932,0,t1_ctxygy3,Okay Im sorry but you have no idea what you are talking about here. He picked Giroud because he just fits better against you guys because your defenders play very deep so Walcott would have trouble making runs finding space for through balls. Also Olivier has a good record against you and Walcott isnt that convincing as a striker playing alone. Sanchez? Really? Most of the people were surprised he was even on the bench because he just came back from holidays. He trained with the team for like  days I think and he was there only in case and that case happened so he came in on the pitch but you couldve clearly see he isnt ready yet he was just slow he needs another  or  weeks of preparation imo. The plan was good but it was horribly executed as you could see from Wenger anger there are rumours he locked players for  minutes after the game. Even though Arsenal played poorly and West Ham was very mature we lost mostly because of Cech mistakes both goals are mostly his fault even though defenders didnt do great he still shouldve saved that any day of the week. I blame him and the midfield for no creativity Ramsey was very annoying Ozil too static for himself Coquelin is a DM so its not his job but he shouldnt have lost the ball those few times and Cazorla was playing a little bit deeper. But actually no one except Cech played horribly bad and no one played well except for Ox who imo was looking very well he was looking sharp. But back to the topic  Wenger said he expected West Ham to be a very tough opponent as he was convinced you guys are better prepared for the season right now. And I really cant get how do you see him understimating you guys while you were a strong team last year and you are only stronger with players like Payet who is very very good and can be a top player in the league.,Hammers,ctz6xev,1,t5_2sco3

5825786,0,t1_cxfgdyy,Is he getting a free pass relative to Jenks? Yes.Is he just as culpable as Jenks? Yes. As are Reid Tonka and the center of our midfield. In fact I think sides target Creswell. He frequently gets caught out of position. He is prone to losing the ball when challenged when pressured he frequently misplays the pass he can get knocked off the ball quite easily and because of his size  he is very vulnerable on set plays and in crossing situations from the far flank.Im not saying Cres isnt a better player than Jenks or that Jenks doesnt deserve some criticism or that Jenks isnt having a poor season relative to last season. Im saying that hes getting targeted by the fans while our other defenders are getting off scotfree. Aaron is an impressive player when he bombs forward down the wing. He can deliver an excellent cross and he puts defenses under pressure but hes not a great defender. In fact I might go so far as to say hes an average defender.,Hammers,cxjaaw7,1,t5_2sco3

6104203,0,t3_3z58yc,Some thoughts after our excellent win.Were a better side than Liverpool. Period. Pundits journos experts get it right. We won because were better. And we stopped pushing forward after the half. It wasnt Liverpool pressing us back it was a tactical decision not one I particularly agree with btw. Dont make excuses for the Scouse. We are now a better side than them.Ginge. IMO he has now established himself as our  back. The other  should be fighting to play along side of him. What a winter hes having. Maybe even one of the top cbs in the league right now. though we might be better off he reconsidered the number of shoe string high headers he likes to make.Im very happy to concede that Antonio is making me eat my words. Hes improving match by match his confidence is sky high hes become a defensive and attacking weapon not just a place holder for Moses. Moses is going to have to wait his turn now. If Antonio can fix his first touch issues we have the bargain buy of the season on our hands. I will gladly eat humble pie on this one. Keep it up Michail.Lanzini. Since his return weve become a dangerous side going forward again. What a good player he is and what a shame hes gone down again. Its such a pleasure to have a player of his calibre in the side.Andy Carroll. Hes back. Against the right side hes simply a wrecking ball. Poor old Benteke was given a lesson on how to play the big man in the middle role today. That hes back on form makes me a little nervous because every time he hits his stride.......SNAP. Knock on wood it doesnt.And Payet. Our dear old Boleyn deserves to have a player of his quality to grace her pitch in her last season. Im still not sure how we managed to sign him. It is absolutely imperative that in the summer we bring in some more players closer to his level. That will keep him motivated to push on with us and it will automatically put us in contention for qualification. The Daves need to rethink whatever budget they have in mind for the summer and bring in the players at whatever position they can to partner with Dimitri. In this current league I dont think were that far away from becoming a legitimate top side. Make the right upgrades and we are in the conversation. home amp away vs Liverpool. That sounds so good. How thankful I am that we ended up with Slaven over Klopp. COYI!,Hammers,cyjhhqq,9,t5_2sco3
6144470,0,t1_cyo0aq5,Most American sports feature frequent scoring so things are a lot more quantifiable there.  By and large my countrymen dont seem to be able to appreciate subtler displays of athleticism.  I often say football is akin to watching a fencing match.  Most people wont be able to tell who the better swordsman is until the end of the match and will then assume the numbers tell the full story  but there are little indicators that can let a trained eye know when things happen that had no business occurring or as is said for football when things happen against the run of play.

7039336,0,t3_4bzi19,Its no conspiracy Slaven and Sullivan want Benteke. He has the physical attributes to be a good signing but I think hes shown to be very weak mentally. His attitude reminds me of Mo Diames when he was sulking his way through his tenure with us. Benteke has sulked and dragged his feet at both Liverpool and Villa. I cant imagine why wed want to put the sides chemistry at risk. Its the greatest attribute we have right now.I would imagine that we might try to bring him in on loan like we did with AC but if we cant and we have to buy him then it looks like Carroll will be shipped. Andy has become an excellent final third of the match sub. He absolutely destroys tired defenders in that role. And hes been scoring off the bench. I dont see anything but a sustained mope from Benteke if he plays that role. Hes proven he cant come off the bench. That would mean that if we brought him in hed likely be our starting .

Randolph did his lovely turn and did alright as did cresswell. Payet was poor as he has been for the past many weeks but still manged ? assists and Reid still isnt at his best but got the winner.

8017649,0,t1_d4h4j7x,Youre probably right Im likely overthinking things. I was slightly playing the devils advocate in saying he almost has to go although given his trajectory and what his goals are and given the amount of time he presumably has left playing at this level if he wants to play in the Champions League and furthermore have the opportunity to win it he probably does have to go. Btw Im not sure Real Madrid would be the best top club for him should he decide to move on although clubs like Real Madrid can afford to buy players for a one off season.In most cases Id say youre correct that even world class players need time to bed in. But it hasnt been true for Dimitri for the past year. He immediately became one of the top players in the premier league and furthermore earned a berth in the French squad when Deschamps said there was no place for him. Not only did he earn a spot he became their talisman and leader. On his current form Dimi isnt going to need much time to integrate.I wont argue against the OS being a launching pad for the club. I remain skeptical about how much of an advantage it will give the club in terms of luring top talent and for becoming a power in the English game. No doubt the ceiling for success has been raised significantly compared to the limitations the Boleyn provided fiscally and otherwise but until it is proven that we can succeed in that stadium Ill hold off on passing judgement. I dont think it is as big an attraction to players as we think it is. At the end of the day players want money. And love.As for my statement on the strikers waiting on Dimi well I was being a little naughty there tbh. I was trying to stir up a little chat which you ave graciously obliged me with. Like I said above top players and the agents and clubs that broker them want money. Lots of it. Basically Im already sick of all of this international football. I want West Ham.,Hammers,d4h9ayo,2,t5_2sco3

If its like that every week from now then fair play  teething problems explains the dire atmosphere  performances.What worries me about the OS is in games like against Sunderland where we were lacklustre at best getting a chant going was like getting blood out of a stone. At Upton Park that was the type of game where the fans could make a difference and spur the team on to get the winner. Maybe I was spoiled by where my ST was at Upton Park but my impression of the OS is of being surrounded by people who arent interested unless were playing well and represent the new type of fan discussed in this thread.

He doesnt pick a pass he doesnt beat people he frequently loses it with a basic pass and looks completely unbothered when hes done so.I get his frustrations   he probably had the chance to move in the summer and turned it down because he believed in the project and now hes wondering what the fuck hes doing here. The thing is  we all did. We all believed in the project we all believed Sullivan and his billy big bollocks shit about a marquee striker and a new era for our club. The other players probably did too. Now its been shown to be a lie but hes not going to get a move by sulking and being half the player we know he can be and lets not forget what WHU has done for him  he regained his position in the French squad due to his performances with us and the contract hes on now likely dwarfs anything he was getting paid in Ligue . ,Hammers,dav5loz,1,t5_2sco3

9943625,0,t3_5hvq0y,One thing I think his wages would be the stumbling block for us. I am a fan of Hart. I think he is a top keeper that just isnt someone that plays out the back. I think Rando is a good keeper. So is Adrian. The issue with Adrian and the reason I wouldnt mind replacing him is that his handling is terrible. Sometimes I think his handling makes him afraid to TRY to catch the ball or handle the ball in the area. He also thinks his footwork is a bit better than it really is because he doesnt really seem to have the composure. Adrian is a cult hero at the club because he really does seem to love the club. But much like Carlton Cole we have these cult heroes and we want them in the team but we need better to be able to build something for the long term. However all that said our priority positions should be . RB . FWST . CD  GK. The defender would be great for us is we dont bring back and blood in one of the Reeces. Because we need someone who can push Reid for his place because Reid has been making just some silly mistakes. And when he isnt Oggy seems to do some silly things but Oggy has been our  defender all season. RBFW is self explanatory. ,Hammers,db3oftr,4,t5_2sco3

Moonflower is right though the fans have been spread out which has fucked things up a bit and the stewards are genuinely well shite. Fortunately the stewards have stayed clear from our lot since about week  so thats not an issue for me but it is for others. There are things I like about the stadium but theres a lot I dont. Itll never be Upton Park but Im surrounded by cunts whinging about new fans while missing a third of the game while theyre boozing and leaving at  minutes against United which I think is half the problem with the atmosphere.

10415795,0,t1_dcon32t,Its fine if you want to have a discussion but demanding answers from people when youve failed to offer any beyond snarky quips doesnt really aid in the process now does it. Theres a difference between using a forum to express your opinion and defending it with solid arguments you know like answers and using a forum to express your opinion and defending it like a payetulant child by denying peoples responses and demanding that they give you a proper solution while failing to produce one of your own.Its nonsensical to offer an opinion that begs for a solution without having one yourself or lacking that without being receptive to what people are putting forward. And Im not including the usamuellwindu responses in that obviously. Love watching him be a cunt to shitty mugs on rsoccer but CLEARLY its doing nothing for the argument here so ignore it and move on. Hes not an accurate example of even a fraction of the responses youve gotten so far so quit cherrypicking for your own benefit. Not if you wanna have an actual conversation anyway. Otherwise do go on patting yourself on the back for having an opinion and expressing it belligerently.I mean honestly what would you do with the money? You can accept that theres use for it. I think we both agree that splurging it on players who couldnt be arsed to actually play for us is the wrong move here so what would you do if not try to bring in players either from the lower leagues or from the top flights internationally? Yeah we are not gonna sign a Pogba or a Suarez or a Neymar but for our immediate needs we dont have to.  million can go a long way in securing solid players who yeah may not be super stars and may not have a historic impact on the club in the long run but that doesnt mean that they wouldnt be worth a shot or that they wouldnt help us reach higher goals. Its a process one that sees way more failure than it does successes so you just gotta hope that one of them comes through in your lifetime. I mean just think how many people died knowing for a fact the Chicago Cubs would forever be complete and utter shit. That was  and seasons of fucking strife but they got there eventually.Enjoy what you can guy.
