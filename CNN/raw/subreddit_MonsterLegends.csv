8193665,0,t1_d51omjf,I love healing but I lost a team war battle because both of us had healers and the healers were the last ones alive.  It seemed like the other healer could heal more than I could damage although it was not hitting very hard.  I finally got him down to  health when I ran out of time.  Those were twenty awesome minutes wasted.,MonsterLegends,d51rd6p,2,t5_354cm

9405750,0,t3_59cin8,If youre desperate for maze coins and are willing to spend a bit of gems you could always respin your pvp wheel prize until you get the  maze coin prize. Its much more cost efficient than actually purchasing the coins outside of discounts. Usually it takes an average of  gems or respins until you get it unless you are really unlucky. Being active in pvp within a  hour period can net you up to  maze coins with this method. Also unlike the normal means of getting coins you can keep doing this additionally spending  gems to quickly get a pvp stamina without having to wait for any pool time cooldown if you want to get more than  per day.Otherwise if youre really just after Demise alone and dont plan on going through the extreme method I describe theres still enough days left that youd have enough coins to get her as long as youre reasonably active. Just be sure to spend it during happy hour discount time.,MonsterLegends,d988tsa,1,t5_354cm

11276431,0,t1_df97kki,Monsters you already have will probably already be counted for the collections. For example if one of the collections requires Pandaken and you already have him by the time the Monster Library Pandaken will already be counted in that collection. Thats just a guess though.Also Im assuming that each collection will reward a different amount of Cells and collections that require rarer Monsters will give you more Cells.,MonsterLegends,dfa60zs,1,t5_354cm

Alces is also good but would only buy him so when i could afford them both so if you have  to  war coins. For magic wait till you get a great offer for there should be one soon for eggeater because of the breeding recipes ,MonsterLegends,dfus3xs,3,t5_354cm

11705564,0,t1_dgmfe89,I am at a weird point I had managed to go this far without Metalsaur or a metal habitat but there are eight metal uncommon and eight rare metal monsters.  It seems like each of them if they are not in some chapter they are required to breed one that is.  I figured out every monster that I needed for every chapter.  Raane Crux and Vortux were hatching but I think the only elemental breedable monsters I still need are metal.  I have many more in storage but it is weird to not have anything I want to breed.  Unfortunately I am not sure I can complete any additional chapters without purchasing monsters and none of the rewards are worth the cost of just purchasing one monster.  I know we are gaining Keeper cells but I keep thinking there should be a meta reward complete five chapters and you earn something extra cool.,MonsterLegends,dgmukao,1,t5_354cm
