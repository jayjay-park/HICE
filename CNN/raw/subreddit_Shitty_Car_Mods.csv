583300,0,t1_cg61w94,its just aesthetic no harm done. No fingers pointed. No points proven. Its a bit of fun thats more art than it is engineering. Modifying cars does not mean you need to make a car go faster or make it corner harder. Its just something to do with cars that isnt conventional. People do own cars for more than going from point A to B. The thing about autoculture is that its not limited to building cars to tackle  times or set lap records.To put this fad into perspective most hotrods dont go fast are not built to be better but rather built because you can and it looks cool. Those cars that men spend months and years building in their garages sure do look nice but they arent fast nor do they drive well. The odd one is but I dont see many steel body  ford roadsters with  cubic inch nitrous injected  second dragsters thumping around town. Even the ones built to go fast are not much faster than a s era mustang If that. They dont drive well. They dont have good brakes. They cant turn corners. Some of them sit so low you cant drive them. Yet they dont get nearly as much hate as the stance culture but they are not so different. Even if you lower a car and tweak the suspension to fit fatter tires or maybe avoid outside edge camber wear on your track rat your car gets labeled as stance and is immediately hated questioned and bitched at until Reddit is blue in the face because apparently modifying cars means making cars faster.The hate for stance makes less sense than stance itself. If you dont like it no one is forcing you to do it. But if you spend most of your life indoors and bitch that people who spend money on cars rather than Pokemon cards and Xbox games are wasting money have too much of it then you are as equally qualified at judging stance as I am at judging figure skating.,Shitty_Car_Mods,cg6kq78,1,t5_2wfqt

864693,0,t3_23zxdw,Heres some random trivia.DYK that the Mustang logo on Mustangs almost always faces the left?The only place where a horse faces to the right on a Mustang is an emblem on the right side of the car which will face forward. But otherwise if its on the front or back of the car or in the interior or on the wheels the horse faces left in the logo.The horse also always runs left on any advertizing associated with the car that involves a horse.Or at least that was the case up until  I stopped paying attention after that...The reason for this is that Mustangs are not race horses.Races horses always run right. Assuming youre sitting in the stands on the outside of the racetrack when the horse race past you theyre facing to your right.Ford was saying that this car was not intended to a thoroughbred. During the s Ford was courting Ferrari. Ford wanted to buy the rights to the Ferrari name and Ferrari himself wanted to stop screwing around with road cars and just concentrate on racing cars. And Ferrari used a prancing race horse logo.Ford and Ferrari couldnt come to an agreement and Enzo gave Ford the shaft which turned into a fierce rivalry that gave us the Ford Cobra and GT  as Fords attempt to beat Enzo in his own game.So the concept of the Mustang as it was produced was supposed to be some of the flashiness of a Ferrari without the expensive thoroughbred pedigree....So I guess what Im trying to say is... judging by the way he decorated his car youre uncle goes both ways.Hes wild and untamed like a Mustang but with the pedigree of a thoroughbred to back it up.Lucky guy...,Shitty_Car_Mods,ch2kk9k,4,t5_2wfqt

2410586,0,t1_cm9n42y,I think you are confusing friction force with something else. By definition Fma. There is always a mass component for nonrelativistic physics. Ffrict  maLet me give an example to why what you said sounds silly. Lets say I have an enormous metal roller. A large cylindrical metal block that allows one to roll metal into sheets lets make it comically large and a ton in weight. On top of it we have a mounting mechanism. One thing we mount to the top of it is a wood block with sand paper on the bottom of it. Another sample we strap an anvil with sand paper on the bottom. The third we mount a metal block with the same mass of the metal roller. The only force acting on supplied to the sample is gravity.the wood block the roller will pretty much ignore. the wood will be pulled by friction in the direction of the rotation of the roller.the anvil block we will actually notice the roller slow down a bit the roller rolls at a lower speed or has to do more work to maintain the speed. The frictional force is pulling more now in the opposite direction of the rotation.The metal block of same mass will nearly or completely stop the roller block. The only force slowing down the roller is the friction force .Now friction is independent of area of contact.,Shitty_Car_Mods,cm9noil,15,t5_2wfqt

They really only work with FWD vehicles not sure why but thats it. They made a big impression on the original rappers in Houston and after they gained popularity across Texas their love for these wheels spread and they are now a staple of rap culture in the South around Texas. Naturally the wheels got larger and stuck out more and are easily found on American luxury cars owned by members of that culture.

Im pretty sure you excluded them to try to assert Im an American fanboy. gtNo one asked for a list of your favorite cars either.I asked for you to prove JDM has good cars. You have yet to start. Im just adding to the conversation to try to show you how to prove a point. gtAnd you said you cant prove a negative? You can prove a negative actually just by giving facts and things that prove your point and show what you want to show. You cant prove a negative. Its tremendously easy to prove a positive. You might say Europe has no good cars. I turn around and say p  or Laferrari. You can then try to prove those wrong but I cant ask you to prove Europe has no good cars.

It is derivative of the same forces that created the architectural movement Deconstructivism and the anime genre Mecha and can be seen in such automobile design examples as the BMW Z by Chris Bangle the Ferrari Enzo the Lamborghini Reventon and Cadillacs Art and Science trend.

3823014,0,t1_cqrzhkm,I was gonna type a goodsized reply breaking everything down but decided it wasnt worth it.You seem like a more intolerable person than all of the tool WRXSTi owners you unreasonably hate. I own a  STi myself and every meet Ive been to and every conversation Ive had with other owners or enthusiasts has been nothing but pleasurable. Also not sure where you get fedoras and neckbeards relating to WRXSTi owners. Ive yet to see anything like that. Thats more Hondas and Acuras around where I live.And to your personal attack on my car go fuck yourself. You have no idea what I have or whats in it. Hey fun fact my STi doesnt even HAVE the wing that youre so butthurt about! Im not even DEFENDING my wing with my posts. My trunk is totally bare!And if I could afford a GT yes Id get one. Id build a proper track toy out of it and daily my STi. Theyre two different cars. No reason to compare them or say one is absolutely better because its more money. Thats a crappy mentality to have. Id love to own both Porsches and Subarus throughout my life and I likely will. I love both companies.I WILL agree with you however that people who whine about how a spoiler IS functional or blah blah blah are annoying. It is functional yes but . of owners wouldnt tell the difference with or without. I know the spoiler is mostly a styling thing an homage to Subarus rally legacy. The STi has a rallywing on it because its a rally car. Whether you like or hate the wing doesnt really matter at the end of the day. I havent lost control of my car at high speeds due to lack of rear downforce yet so!Try not to get so frustrated over a piece of fiberglass. Save it for stance assholes riding on their sidewalls endangering us all and holding up traffic flow trying to maneuver over a . tall bump in the road.endrantMore on point I believe a lot of the hate in this thread is towards the shitpost that doesnt even make sense in a subreddit called Shitty Car MODS.EDIT I guess I did type a goodsized reply.

Typically used to make a car look fast as opposed to modifications that actually make a car faster.gtThis type of exaust is called a mellon shooter because it is large enough to launch a melon that would be inserted into it  if the engine had enough power.Look at the melon shooter on that Civic  its as big as a sewer pipe!about | flag for glitch | Summon urbanbot what is something?,Shitty_Car_Mods,cu02vwk,9,t5_2wfqt

5848285,0,t1_cxm4rll,Sulfur dioxides have decreased with low sulfur diesel. NOx absolutely does not. From the wiki Total nitrogen oxides from petrol cars have decreased by around  through adoption of exhaust catalytic converters as of  while diesel cars still produce nitrogen oxides at a similar level to those bought a decade and a half ago under real world tests hence diesel cars emit around  times more nitrogen oxides than petrol cars. NOx is a byproduct of cylinder temperatures of  or higher and modding a diesel can frequently greatly expand that  times normal. Look at VW theyre about to lose tens of billions for shipping cars with a tune like the one people commonly add aftermarket on other diesels because it increases the NOx pollution by another  to  times. So by tuning it youre getting better fuel economy and more power...but emitting possibly X the NOx of a gas car and thats with the conservative factory version VW used.  the carbon monoxide also isnt really relevant given that carbon monoxide is so much cheaper to scrub than NOx typical tailpipe CO readings on a modern car are basically .Sources  CA Smog Inspector ,Shitty_Car_Mods,cxm8ljb,5,t5_2wfqt

Most of the aftermarket launch control systems are simply an adjustable rev limiters and most of them work by cutting ignition momentary to hold the engine at a set RPM.

Also the wiring harness on the drivers side just above the fender looks partially melted that or someone couldnt be bothered to buy a cheap roll of electrical tape to redo it after cutting it apart. My bet is that the car caught fire was able to be put out and only damaged the engine bay area dude totaled it out got a salvage title figured out how much it would be to rebuild the car and said Fuck that lets have a little bit of fun with it! and after piecing together this monstrosity drove it around for a bit and had some laughs. ,Shitty_Car_Mods,d0ipwtt,13,t5_2wfqt

Lowered on oneofakind Bogarts and the thing hauls ass at the raceway. Lowering serves the function of less drag better aerodynamics better MPG compared to lifting less body sway better traction leading to a more stable launch lower center of gravity so there is less shift in weight between tires etc. You can go on for days what function it would serve. How can you say there is no reason to lower a truck? Its not at all just because someone wanted to that can be the case sometimes but not always. ,Shitty_Car_Mods,degzle9,7,t5_2wfqt
