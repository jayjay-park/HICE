10890470,0,t3_5vkw0c,Would there be a place to discuss shows we started here? The weekly discussion thread should probably be relatively spoilerfree since it only assumes the first episode watched. Would the rest of the subreddit be a place to discuss the rest of the show in specified threads or is this just to be a launching point?Personally I think spoiler tagged threads with the shows title should be allowed as relevant discussion for a certain amount of time after we watch episode . Maybe  weeks? Short enough everyone should be relatively near each other long enough not to have to binge right through.,S01E01,de39wav,8,t5_3j7ml
10895265,0,t1_de32fqh,It is a strong candidate for best drama even though great dramatic TV was still pretty young when The Wire aired the huge increase in quality of cable TV dramas means that many more shows are now competitive on the level of The Wire but I would rank it pretty low as far as interesting pilots.Its like the way they almost never used nondiegetic music an overlaid soundtrack compared to music being played in the story world like someones radio.  In the short term the show feels less stirring because you dont have the musical cues.  In the longer term the show feels much stronger for it surprisingly.Similarly the show avoided a lot of cheap narrative techniques that most shows use to keep viewers interested especially shows with commercials that are written around the commercial breaks keeping them in mind keeping the viewer interested enough to hang around until the break is over.  Each season built slowly.  There were no bait and switch twists like Lost kept doing.  In the end again it was a much stronger show as a resultbut exactly the opposite of what you want if youre only going to watch a shows pilot episode.  It doesnt pander to shortattentionspan viewers to try to keep them engaged it plays slow and long and the reward is there for people who stay with it.,S01E01,de3rpbi,7,t5_3j7ml
