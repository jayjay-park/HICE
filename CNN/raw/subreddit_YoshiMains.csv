5004049,0,t3_3jgqzo,The main issue Ive been having is approaching characters with swords  due to the disjointed hitboxes mainly when theyre throwing out airials Marths fair amp Nair for example when faced with something like this Id recommend taking full advantage of egg throw.,YoshiMains,cup6blu,3,t5_38dri
5397442,0,t3_3oh17m,Have played this matchup a LOT and I can say that yoshi wins at least . Eggs can pretty much be spammed and can completely neutralize gordos. Landing one falling uair or utilt leads into massive uair strings as dedede is so heavy and large. Only problem is getting reliable kills but you should be able to just play safe and stay out of his range the whole time until hes at around  where a nair out of shield will kill him near the ledge. It is also fairly reliable to just uair him when he is doing his weird baits where he floats above your head but its risky because you could eat a bair and die at like . I prefer to play it safe and just camp with eggs getting my big combos in when the opportunities present themselves,YoshiMains,cw1kzy1,1,t5_38dri
5677414,0,t3_3svtdv,Isnt nair a really a good tool against this? It stays out for a while which should mean it can intercept it. I havent played Yoshi in a while and I dont have access to a Wii U currently but this seems like it would work. Let me know if its otherwise,YoshiMains,cx0u7xb,1,t5_38dri

6193305,0,t1_cytl4l3,No Im about  sure that command grab doesnt work right after a grab release either. If Im wrong then they could just roll away anyway. If youre opponent is expecting a grab release then you should just fthrowbthrow them near the edge of the stage or go for a quick dthrow uair as a mixup. ,YoshiMains,cytm3cj,2,t5_38dri
6527336,0,t3_44zx2l,Apparently this was done so that all characters in the game have the same trip data. Previously Yoshi and a few other characters had one more frame of invincibility on trip recovery but now its all standardized.,YoshiMains,czuh8ot,1,t5_38dri

10158856,0,t1_da8lurg,Yea this is good advice.  Itd b best to feel the player out as much as possible for the first  secs or so using eggs n short hop nAirs. SideSpecs help too. B very adaptive n patient with cloud. I hate this matchup. Solo mains are never a good idea if ur trying to b competitive btw imo.,YoshiMains,dbvk9v1,1,t5_38dri
