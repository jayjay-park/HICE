967558,0,t3_255vy9,Sunday is the th anniversary of our first date. So were going to focus on that instead. I will probably recreate the first meal I ever cooked for him and watch movies most of the day. Hell probably call his mom. I will text my stepmom maybe. The dogs go to the groomer on Saturday and I will use that time to run errands so I wont have to leave the house at all on Sunday. ,IFchildfree,che9rr8,3,t5_3011h
3562910,0,t3_3147cz,Being with children and watching people have children can be hard. For me it was like waves. Some days I would be ok and then other days I would be a blubbering mess. I coached myself as to what the correct response to a pregnancy announcement should be. Big smile congratulations! Im so happy for you then excuse myself to go to the bathroom and cry if I needed to. People who care about you will be sensitive to their announcement hurting you but its natural for them to want to celebrate and I feel they should be allowed that so I tried my best to celebrate with them. And honestly I was happy for them it just reminded me why I was also sad.I also have a niece who is my clone. It seems unfair like there is a child out there who should live with me but doesnt. I understand the challenges she faces in life because I faced them too and I want to guide her and nurture her uniqueness. As her aunt I do my best but its not the same as being her parent.Its been a while since we decided to stop the fertility treatments. I have mourned my lack of children. Now I find myself at a point in my life where I am mourning another different loss. I am back to the days of crying at weird moments and feeling like a basket case because I cant process what is happening. One of the things that I cling to is that I survived infertility and I will survive this too. I know at the moment it seems like your childlessness is everything and you will be in pain forever. Eventually you will not hurt as much you will experience joy again and the tears will not flow so freely.,IFchildfree,cpyec3x,4,t5_3011h

4881987,0,t3_3hqfae,Yes yes yesyou are absolutely allowed to feel what you feel.What Ive started saying to the JUST ADOPTTTT!!!!!! people is Oh how many adopted children do you have? I have yet to have anyone say anything other than zero. If your parents had only biological children then they should well understand why you were interested in that one route and no other. Its something billions of parents have done themselvesbio children only. If theyre not being shit on then neither should we be.Even if youre not yet in the place where you can speak up and I get thattook a long time for me then just know the folks saying this dont know shit from shineola.,IFchildfree,cu9wuox,7,t5_3011h

6331634,0,t3_42a9hf,You have to be happy being yourself living your life whatever that life may be.  A child is not going to bring you happiness you bring you happiness.  You should go talk to somebody about this stuff youre worth it and infertility is a big burden to carry.  Let someone show you how to carry it! ,IFchildfree,cz9c5iw,3,t5_3011h
6398858,0,t1_czgbr3i,Going through IF as an aunt....   You dont choose your parents as a kid.   But kids can choose the adults they bond with besides their parents.   Seeing my nieces thrilled I have come for a visit and so excited to show me things do things with me etc.... Being an aunt is not a parent but as someone who also grew up with a really cool aunt an aunt is a THING.  Special in its own right.  And the more you grow up the more you need aunt wisdom to navigate the tough stuff.,IFchildfree,czgzg62,3,t5_3011h

7551420,0,t3_4ez4wh,I just came here to ask the same thing. We just moved from where wed lived for five years. I havent made any friends yet. Weve joined a local church and started getting involved there. Weve been trying to go to Meetup groups too. Were in such a weird demographic... it seems all people our age   have kids or are finishing up having kids and were over here like... Hey... ,IFchildfree,d30k6mq,1,t5_3011h

9191934,0,t1_d8h2z4c,Ugh I hope you cut those assholes out right away I wanted to punch anyone who told me to just relax. I think what your doing sounds like a good idea then for you and considering how damaging see those baby announcements can be I dont blame you for saying forget it and getting off social media. ,IFchildfree,d8h58b9,1,t5_3011h
9229859,0,t3_56q2pp,Good for you! If you dont feel it dont say it. Its ok to be bitter daggers and stabs hurt.Im also in Canada and survived Thanksgiving. Was I thankful yes. Was I cheery about it no.  Will I ever get back to being cheerily thankful for things who knows! This is new and shitty land. We do what we can with what we have. Good for you for doing what you can,IFchildfree,d8lyah1,2,t5_3011h
9306382,0,t3_57udyw,Happy Birthday!Take the good days for sure. Youre so right that we need to be thankful for the good things we have in our lives and not emphasize what we dont have. And we all have a lot.,IFchildfree,d8vng82,2,t5_3011h

10560100,0,t3_5r7gor,This is the infertility childfree sub so we are not childfree by choice. Either we werent successful with treatments there were no treatments available to us or the cost was prohibitive. Personally the only option available to me was a donor and we decided that we didnt want to spend the money on a treatment I have ethical concerns with. Its an  year wait to adopt a baby here and Ill be past the point Ill want a newborn in  years. And I dont think I have what an older child would need and would be adopting one for myself rather than to help them.Seriously though I would get yourself and your husband tested. It might be something really simple why youve had difficulty. You dont know if you dont get it investigated.,IFchildfree,dd53ukl,6,t5_3011h
10933379,0,t3_5rg1gd,You do not see it like that right now but this may be great news for you. You will not have biological children and that sucks but you will be an auntie! You will have children in your life and if you are open to it you could very well form a strong bond of love with your nephews and nieces. Yes they will never be your own children but they are family. I bet they would love to sleep over or spend days at the zoo with you. You could be the person that they turn to when they need advice especially if it is something they will not be comfortable talking to their parents to. My mother is very close with my cousins even though they all have great parents. Just because you will not be a biological mother doesnt mean that you dont get to enjoy the joy of children. Just be open to see your sisters potential pregnancy from a different perspective.,IFchildfree,de7p92o,1,t5_3011h
