2863930,0,t3_2swepk,Try a striking weapon of some kind. You should have a morning star from earlier I believe. If not you can get a mace or something from Lenigrast. Strike damage deals way higher DPS.As for strategy you want to try and get the gargoyles to either clump together or separate really far apart. It can be hard to do the latter so I usually opt for the former on my playthroughs. When clumped you want to bait all the gargoyles attacks simultaneously if you can then roll dodge it. Once that happens youve got a good  strikes depending on your timing and weapon. Even if you cant get a strike in its better than taking a hit but sometimes it can be better to trade with the gargoyle if it means you get some serious damage in or kill it.Once more come out theyre gonna start using fire breath attacks. They vary a bit but generally they have a straight fire breath a fire sweep and an aerial fire sweep. Theyre actually a godsend because its an easy dodge and it generally leaves the gargoyle vulnerable to attack or incapacitated allowing you to focus on the other ones.Keep at it man and dont forget the belfry gargs are an optional boss so no shame in progressing a bit and coming back later.,DarkSoulsHelp,cntmorv,2,t5_2sxcx

I actually went in with Vengarl thinking hed last a little while but I was wrong. Although those npc summons are much more resilient than ours characters it didnt take long for him to die.
