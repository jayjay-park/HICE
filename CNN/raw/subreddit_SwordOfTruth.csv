1507502,0,t1_cj54fzl,the guy from  hes got the chains and piercings going on and i agree his attitude and personality from the film would work but i think id need to see him bulk up a little. Jagang was described as being very physically powerful and intimidating. Maybe youre right about Ian McKellan i guess im just biased though cos i think hes awesome. ,SwordOfTruth,cj58o20,1,t5_2sr6t
1603496,0,t3_2cmft9,Mine shipped from Amazon last night and will be here tomorrow!Thisll probably be the last Goodkind book I buy unless something really changes... these last two books in the new series hes done just arent even close to being as good as the original series is. Dont know whether its because hes decided to not make them as much of a priority as he did with the first series but his writing has definitely gone downhill.. ,SwordOfTruth,cjhafdm,2,t5_2sr6t
3266279,0,t3_2xir29,Im curious why there is a heart monitor signal on the image.  Im wondering if this is where this story intersects with The Law of Nines.  Perhaps Richard crosses over into the other world through the underworld?  I dont know but its kind of odd to see a heartbeat in a book that doesnt include this sort of technology.,SwordOfTruth,cp0kz8p,4,t5_2sr6t
3347236,0,t1_cp9sl81,I feel you! Its funny cause they drag out for a long time all the talk about how bad the order is and how life is precious and what not. Then when it comes to the ending of the order and all it was the least descriptive part of the entire  books Chainfire thru Confessor. Like damn that was brief. Like Terry got super lazy at the end of confessor I think he put too much emphasis on what is already known.,SwordOfTruth,cp9t6qi,2,t5_2sr6t

4274595,0,t1_cs7f5ka,Pretty much where I found myself at that point. oh well may as well see this through. It just kept getting worse and worse for me. However these last few books did make me appreciate the first  books that much more. ,SwordOfTruth,cs7gr0h,2,t5_2sr6t
