11279578,0,t1_dfafhs6,To start Ill share that I hate the word Moist but you have seemed to counteract its effect with Tentacle.  I kinda like it.It concerns me that you say nobody is having their minds changed.  Do you really agree with that?   Wouldnt you hope that if the Trump team is cleared by evidence that people change their minds and say well it looks like we were wrong?Alternatively  if evidence is released that indicates collusion and wrong doing wouldnt you hope and expect the American people who voted for Trump to say fuck that sucks. I guess we were wrong?  ,RussiaLago,dfaiv44,4,t5_3jjnn
