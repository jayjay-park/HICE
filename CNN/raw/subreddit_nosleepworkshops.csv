7027606,0,t3_4bsi63,Its really my least favorite rule because its very subjective. In my experience you cant be anywhere close to the line.I agree with Gravy that the twist at the end isnt especially effective. I think having a border collie kill the sheep is an angle already. There are a lot of questions raised by Breaker breaking bad. Answer those while presenting a clear ongoing danger and your story will have the length and tension required.The part where Breaker is discovered should be tense as hell. Following a tail of blood into the bedroom with the power off not knowing if its a beast or a man whos killing their animals... They cant just find it. Its the best part to show rather than simply telling the audience Hey we found Breaker. That moment right before? Thats Horror. And when they get there it should bring more questions not fewer. Thats shocking.Hope this helps! Ill be looking for a second revision to go up!,nosleepworkshops,d1cxknc,3,t5_2u0d2
8315919,0,t1_d5f114u,gt hange the title too. Its borderline rule breaking. thinking about the rule on tags and flair. You cant add true to those so Im iffy More imagery better title can and will do ,nosleepworkshops,d5h1odh,2,t5_2u0d2
8336867,0,t3_4tr6ws,Im not a mod but I believe that would get the story removed for having outside links. You could always link a screenshot from imgur though. Ive done that a few times with no issues. ,nosleepworkshops,d5jnvcd,3,t5_2u0d2
8411034,0,t3_4usttl,Ditto.  Overall its a solid story good character pretty unique.  I like that he goes to such great lengths to be two different people.  Im not sure what you are looking to have critiqued specifically.,nosleepworkshops,d5sx9as,1,t5_2u0d2

8439570,0,t1_d5wha75,Im sorry if it made you uncomfortable. That was the reason I was a little worried it would be too dark for nosleep because it is a very heavy topic. I know the title is clickbaity but since Im a new writer to the community I wasnt sure how else to draw attention. My original title was simply The coffee mug. What would you recommend for a title?,nosleepworkshops,d5whh5x,1,t5_2u0d2
8490470,0,t1_d62uk87,Stick to cryosleep since it would be easy to disprove so believability is out.Just call in The Abandoned. Its short to the point and doesnt reveal too much of the plot.As far as putting an end to the madness.... uMikeyKnutson? uLevlove? utheephemera?,nosleepworkshops,d62uups,2,t5_2u0d2
8805642,0,t3_50qmi4,Hi! Another rnosleep mod here. I have to agree with utheephemera that theres a nonhorror issue. I know that you wanted the horror to be subtle but its too subtle. It could easily be interpreted as this dude and his mom are weird andor nuts rather than scare the audience. You mentioned that theres a followup... I would suggest either posting both parts together or adding something to this story that makes the horror a bit more clear.Maybe the mother licks her lips or makes some noise then starts to rush toward the MC before the man picks him up and carries him to the front of the house? Doesnt necessarily get close but its clear shes going after MC. Added creep factor if she rushes toward MC on all fours or something,nosleepworkshops,d76bhnb,3,t5_2u0d2

11635302,0,t1_dgefpsh,There was an anthology horror series at one point that had a story based on this idea. Cant remember the name of it right now unfortunately.Let me tell you the image of a woman with insect mandibles between her legs sticks with you!,nosleepworkshops,dgevhgh,1,t5_2u0d2
