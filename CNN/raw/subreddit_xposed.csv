541357,0,t3_20a0ps,I havent tried much xposed development yet but looking at the xposed tutorial did you update the xposedinit in the assets folder? You say youve changed the package name so the file has to point to the new entry point.From gt The only thing that is still missing now is a hint for XposedBridge which classes contain such entry points. This is done via a file called xposedinit. Create a new text file with that name in the assets folder. In this file each line contains one fully qualified class name.

My researchTBH this sketched me out. I deleted the directory and tried a bunch of apps to try and find the culprit my instinct said Vipers Audio but it wasnt. Then I did a root search of my phone for the word baidu. I used CMs file explorer rather than a rd party app. Heres what came up In folder datadatacom.estrongs.android.popsharedprefs is a file BaiduStatSDKSendRem.xml. When I look at the XML its pretty simple. Its sending a logfile. I dont know what its sending a log ofthat bothers me.I also did a little more background research. Apparently one of Baidus founders is an angel investor in EStrongs. I hate to say it but this might compel me to stop using ES FileExplorer even though its a great app...Do with this information what you will.Oh one more thing I tried a search for baidu using ES it didnt find the xml file...

7780128,0,t1_d3qi5cy,This is very close to what I had in mind however it does have a drawback for my use case. It will have to suffice for now thank you for bringing it to my attention.I use tasker along with secure settings so that with  wrong attempts to unlock the device the unlock code is changed from a PIN to a long alphanumeric password. This effectively resets the encryption password to the default password. With xposed this should be a non issue.The accessibility services issue I mention in the OP is also of concern. If one does not remember to reset their encryption password through CryptFS after enabling one of said services they are likely to be reminded of it only after rebooting their device which could be a considerable amount of time depending on use.Also thisgt If you change the device unlock passwordPIN the encryption password will be automatically changed as well. You need to use this tool again to change it back if required.This is not that much of a deal breaker however.,xposed,d3qjb7c,1,t5_2xgaj

8510983,0,t3_4w97no,I just think the snapprefs app got to bloated and made updating hard because everything breaks after each update. I really wish he would release a simple app like Xinsta  so you can just save the images. Were you just update a hook file on a server and the client downloads it so no need to release an apk.

The stability isnt perfect its not THAT bad performance is great battery is average and well Nougat really is up and running. Well. It runs well.
