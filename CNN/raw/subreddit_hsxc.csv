5601037,0,t3_3qrvel,I dont know where you should be for d but  miles a week and you should be far under s. I ran maybe  to  miles a week this summer and just ran a pr of  last week. Im a junior and my freshman pr was  so fairly proud of where Im at. If I was to make any suggestion it would be to do track both indoor and outdoor and dont mess around about it either. My best assumption is that while XC times look good track times tell college coaches exactly what you can do. After all XC courses are all different tracks are all the same. Anyways good luck im sure youll be running s in no time.,hsxc,cwrd22r,1,t5_2t3il

7875709,0,t3_4n31h6,Long consistent runs. Add recovery days if you need it but aim for a few double digits runs a week. Youre mainly just going to want to shoot up the mileage until the season starts then after the base has been built work on speed. As a mainly distance runner against my will try to have a day every once in a while to keep loose and where you can focus on shorter speeds like  or  ladders or something. Keeping that speed of a mid distance runner can keep close races competitive ,hsxc,d41aw52,1,t5_2t3il
