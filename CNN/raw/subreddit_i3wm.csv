What comes after Command in iblocks.conf is run by a shell so whatever you can run in a shell you can put in the Command variable in an iblocks block.I dont know enough python to be sure but python cant do shell oneliners right? Because of the whitespaceindentation issue not being able to chain lines with  .

3350842,0,t1_cpa7mjx,You seem to be missing something.  The trick I posted doesnt use the nagbar. It creates a mode similar to the resize mode that mode for resizing containers.  You enter this custom mode by pressing a key combination modPause in the example and while in this mode you have new keyboard shortcuts for restarting suspending shutting off rebooting and so on.  You can hit escape to go exit this special mode.,i3wm,cpa7ypu,1,t5_2tzja

4911493,0,t3_3i4na0,I know this isnt an answer to your actual question but anyway youre already using a python script that calls shell commands.
