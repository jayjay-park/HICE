7715388,0,t3_4ktliu,Yes its possible but not all cores are working N PSX and newer are not in the package... Also there is no support for WiiU pro controller yet... Still you can use any other controller Wiimote and classic controller work fine and hope they add WiiU pro controller support soon.  As with any modding look for guides and updated info about it if youre looking to add homebrew to your WiiU. rWiiHacks and rWiiUHacks have info about.,RetroArch,d3j6qie,1,t5_32ii0

9097614,0,t3_54gbve,Awesome this is very exciting! Now if only I could go higher than x res without slaying my fps,RetroArch,d85dx84,1,t5_32ii0
9424563,0,t3_593avk,It sounds like Retroarch has read permission but not write permission to your SD card. I let my phone adopt my SD card as internal storage and I dont run into this issue so Im not sure if theres an easy systemlevel solution. For retroarch in particular though you could change the save file and save state directories to a set folder on your internal storage rather than storing them along with the ROM.,RetroArch,d9ammnj,1,t5_32ii0

10059068,0,t3_5jp4da,Just prefer the look of Emulation Station. And as far as posting on their forum. Its been. Hacked so badly its fucking pointless.,RetroArch,dbipynl,1,t5_32ii0
10125947,0,t3_5kxw4r,Does it run faster in a window? press fHave you disabled all shaders?Have you tried changing the RA video driver?Which cores have you tried?,RetroArch,dbrf13y,2,t5_32ii0
10383423,0,t1_dckl65y,I agree this is the only good workaround for certain systems  but why would RetroArch even bother with using a graphical user interface GUI if thats all the program is capable of? i.e. using simple text menus to start a game is all it seems good for on the Vita sadly ,RetroArch,dcl0x11,1,t5_32ii0

10421513,0,t1_dcp8o0j,Ive been in touch with Mark actually  hes a good guy. I almost have this sorted out  its a semimanual process to add all the roms but at least search and replace helps a lot with changing the paths in those playlist files so it sees the ROMs.,RetroArch,dcpciw8,1,t5_32ii0

10722035,0,t1_ddlq4dz,Not yet Ill give that a try. Does it require a custom ROM or can I flip a switch in the core options and load a GameBoy ROM directly? ,RetroArch,ddlwcyf,1,t5_32ii0
