I also think snapchat is somewhat shady in the way they have handled the media in this and while I see they are lawfully in the clear from their terms that users agree to if they were not breached...they have been breached before. All in all...Im looking for my name.,thesnappening,cl8dtar,2,t5_33yao

2125155,0,t3_2j62jo,Hardly legit since from that screenshot its clear that the names in their sample are those already known. Its also clear that the list is sorted by snapchatreceived which quickly drops off down to  in the sample.So... If that is an actual screenshot then their database contains little more probably no more than the few names that were already known.Most of the raw filenames dont contain user names and I dont think well ever have some name service. I think the data just isnt there.,thesnappening,cl9yces,1,t5_33yao
