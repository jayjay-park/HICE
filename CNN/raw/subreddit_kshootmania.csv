4292385,0,t3_37cdk0,OK after hours of tweaking I may have found something usefull.  Using the lastest version of K shoot mania Ver . I managed to have  stable FPS and very little to none microstutter.  ampnbspIn game settings    Resolution     texture quality high   Animation BG  on   Vsync  On  Also go to the Nvidia Control Panel keep in mind that my panel is in french so sorry if my translation is not  accurate   Select NVIDIA card for Kshootmania of course   Multiple Graphical processor acceleration  performance mode single display   Texture Filtering  sampling optimization  Activated   Texture Filtering  quality  High Performance   Texture Filtering  Linear Optimisation  Activated   Power Management  Maximum Performances   Threaded optimisation  Activated   VSync  Activated   Pre rendered virtual frames     Pre rendered maximum frames     Triple buffer  Activated  ampnbspSo yeah .... with all that I can finally play Kshootmania and consider buying a supercharger.  Im pretty sure those are not the optimal settings and that I activated some pretty useless features but fu it. It works and Ive spent way too much time in it to keep on fiddling with it.,kshootmania,cs9h1pa,1,t5_354x9

5303424,0,t3_3nn7ah,Hiya! Im dinner dinnrr and I am interested in being a part of the KShoot mod team. Ive been playing KShoot for a couple of months now joined the facebook group awhile ago and am pretty good not really at the game which is irrelevant but whatever. Im good at knowing code and tech stuff. Ive moderated the Super Smash Bros. Melee Netplay IRC chat before it became what is known as Anthers Ladder. I havent dabbled in the KShoot editor but I know my way around design and how to fix certain things. Also I like updating and making sure those who are new to KShoot can get the skins and songs they so rightfully deserve.Cheers.EDIT I have access to Adobe CS Pro so I MIGHT be able to get a theme. Dunno dont count me on it.,kshootmania,cvpkot3,1,t5_354x9

7597025,0,t1_d342sgi,Yes that just means its a matter of time before the lubricant inside the Copals dry out. Mine did the same and I bought the Arcade knobs.Since you just got your SVSE a few days ago Id contact support. Their support covers replacement parts  shipping for the first week.,kshootmania,d35qrtq,1,t5_354x9

9339714,0,t1_d8ztvd5,The video isnt KSM but there are skins based on SDVX in the wiki under Skins.,kshootmania,d8zvkiz,1,t5_354x9
9340334,0,t3_58f5t5,You dont and you cant. The games UI was designed that way and will likely not be changed because of how the coding is. If youve seen someone running the AC layout thats not KSM. And not to be requested for or openly discussed as in casual conversation andor talking about websitesusers who have it in this sub.,kshootmania,d8zye5a,3,t5_354x9

11076716,0,t1_den78rf,I got the matte paper its a good thickness. The color is slightly better than an inkjet printer. I guess I shouldve went with gloss. I ordered a no border sheet but they ended up giving me a sheet with borders anyways and it messed with the dimensions.,kshootmania,denjaoa,2,t5_354x9
