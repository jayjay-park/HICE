3100692,0,t1_cojdfwt,It looks like he gets the VP from a henchmen after a struggle and shoots another. Its at about  in this video. Edit theres also a promotional image of him hold a suppressed PPK. Seen here I cant see them straying away from Walthers. Theyve always been a major plot point in the Bond filmsbooks. While the introduction of the P was awesome in the Brosnan films. Nothing compares to Bonds signature PPK. ,HecklerKoch,cojdvu4,8,t5_2w2j7
3500795,0,t3_30afq1,Grayguns and Bill Springfield are the two names I hear a lot on the hkpro forums.  Grayguns can be a little pricey but they are top notch in regards to their Sig trigger work.  And from what Ive heard their hampk actions are comparable.,HecklerKoch,cprbd9j,1,t5_2w2j7

8811392,0,t1_d6uwamg,Would recommend a surefire XC. Its compact and has the perfect light pattern for a pistol IMO. most other likes like the X or TLR lights have more of a throwy type of beam that will have a bright hotspot and cause splashback with the light that will rob you of your night vision. Its not cheap but its a quality light. As for holsters if you google with gun and light combo you can usually find holsters pretty easily. ,HecklerKoch,d770cvn,1,t5_2w2j7

9265951,0,t3_576dwd,Yes it is the best polymer . in the world. I love it but am an HK fanboy. Seriously though its fricken great and nothing like the VP. Standard HK trigger system that is super customizable. I personally like the LEM system but you can do whatever you want.,HecklerKoch,d8qix0r,3,t5_2w2j7

10305982,0,t3_5nkv56,Update .  Changes over previous Ejector geometry timing and spring rate are correct. Misc fitment improvements. I can make the ejector out of aluminum on my CNC but it will require some creative fixturing. My friend runs a laser CNC and it would be great to make it in stainless and weld it up.  Ill see what I can figure out.  Hopefully the next update will be soon and will have  function. Unfortunately due to the way WA state laws are written binary triggers are verboten.  PM me if you have an MPK binary trigger and a video camera. ,HecklerKoch,dcc8l9i,4,t5_2w2j7
