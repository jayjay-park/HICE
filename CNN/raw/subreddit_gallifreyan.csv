2581919,0,t3_2pbgn5,welcome back the bires of popmeii is what I gotno lines coming off the F only passing through itthe thicker line in a doubled letter indicates the letter should be read nd so the M is coming after the Pwith the I it shouldnt really matter since they are the same they can be doubled without changing line weight.,gallifreyan,cmvleda,1,t5_2u1d0

2880988,0,t3_2t4248,Ive always argued for a double K since the ruling is to replace the C not remove it. Its certainly not a consensus though. There are always those who argue one K because phonetics in a nonphonetic alphabet.,gallifreyan,cnvkk19,3,t5_2u1d0

5810429,0,t1_cxhanwv,The Tumblr post has a translation. As for a guide for Rasilonian the creator unfortunately doesnt make it easily accessible. However its still pretty easy to find Rachels first Tumblr posts on her blog are actually also this guide if you prefer a Tumblrbased guide more.

8166644,0,t3_4qrb22,You have written Y A N G when it should probably be Ya NG. There is a character specifically for ng and your vowels dont seem to be on your consonants on either word. Also it is ordered Yang Yin but I dont think you can help that. Other than that I think its pretty neat what youve done with it.,gallifreyan,d4ydopq,3,t5_2u1d0

10876938,0,t3_5ve9jz,to my knowledge collective is written in their own version of gallifreyan that encodes information about the actual sound via the IPA whereas shermans is meant to rewrite english words or other languages letter for letter so theyre really not exchangeable without some heavy modificationseg collective encodes the difference between the sound z and the sound  the s measure and Shermans doesnt,gallifreyan,de1vn6l,1,t5_2u1d0
10878766,0,t1_de1vn6l,Thanks for the help! Ive been hesitant to use the Collective Gallifreyan writing system since it isnt as widespread or as easy to use as Shermans Gallifreyan. I really like the idea of a complete Gallifreyan language but it would b useless if people had no idea what Im saying. I suppose my main problem is that while Im hesitant to write in Collective Gallifreyan Im also hesitant to simply write English in a Gallifreyan font.EDIT Could English written in Circular Gallifreyan be considered an actual Gallifreyan language? I know that in the Star Wars universe their main language is Galactic Basic Standard which is in actuality English with a different alphabet. Could the same be true of Gallifreyan?,gallifreyan,de22fnq,1,t5_2u1d0
