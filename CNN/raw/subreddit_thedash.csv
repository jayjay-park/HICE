6352632,0,t3_42nxqf,This is the changelogNew features Running activity mode on the app has live displays of heart rate steps taken and duration of activity. Live browsing of Activity menu. When in Swimming or Cycling activity mode the app gives a live display of heart rate and duration of activity. Control master volume on The Dash. OnOff control of Audio Transparency. Disable or enable the preconfigured macros for accepting and rejecting incoming phone calls using macro gestures.I cant test it as I have no Android phone. But it is interesting to see that they seem to have add swimming and cycling activity tracking!,thedash,czbq2fm,2,t5_30dgd

6449117,0,t1_czmbfto,If you open the page in google chrome there will be a popup near the address bar that asks if you want the page translated. It deosnt translate everything perfectly but well enough to understand whats going on in the review. Looks like bluetooth connectivity to a smartphone is the biggest issue thus far I pretty much need my phone in hand or in a chestpocket if I want music to play flawlessly from the phone with no skips.,thedash,czmdnkx,2,t5_30dgd
6450688,0,t3_4401wx,Did you eject it from the computer right click the dash in windows before unplugging? Didnt do it the first time and had the same issue,thedash,czmjiz6,2,t5_30dgd
6534084,0,t1_czuuu0o,Ok thanks no real problem with the video quality as the content is more important and I believe it is hard if you have no real professional equipment etc. Please dont see it as a real complain.BTW it looked quite cool how the Dashes were breathing in the packaging. Manchester Ha cool! slapingonmyshoulderproudly As a German it isnt that easy to recognize these details.  So due to my love of Oasis and their later bands Manchester is a kind of Mekka to me I want to visit one day I know sounds childish but these guys were a big part of my teenage and adult life so ...,thedash,czv6d4s,1,t5_30dgd
6585507,0,t3_45pp4m,Helloi have checked all sleeves but the microphone quality is still not useful. I have checked the quality by using an microphone recorder.

7113335,0,t1_d1lk7vi,Toronto Canada. I feel like Bragi just takes a slow approach in shipping to Canada because of the regulation but they should have cleared it with certification and everything so i dont see why Canadian preorder would be any slower...,thedash,d1movqk,1,t5_30dgd
7214631,0,t1_d1wxgsd,I doubt your music problems can be fixed with software. Its a technology issue with BT sadly.. And its not a range issue its a blockage issue your body effectively blocks the signal,thedash,d1y8x6a,1,t5_30dgd
7268453,0,t1_d23qapf,The on dash playback works well. I personally moved completely to streaming so its a hassle to go back to copying sound tracks around...it is probably the best way to use the Dash unfortunately. It seems like such a miss that this has to be the primary method for music playback on such a technologically advanced device.,thedash,d24dfst,1,t5_30dgd
7308228,0,t1_d28vf0n,Hmmm so I also get the dash telling me my heart rate during the intervals but does it record that info in the run keeper app? Post run do you see heart rate records?,thedash,d28w98l,1,t5_30dgd

7750162,0,t1_d3lm32q,Hi I did not try the Spinfits yet. I just looked for them and it seems the model CP may fit the Dash since they fit the Sony MDR. So I ordered the medium size and Ill update my post when I check them out. I like the  degrees movement of their head so I decided to try them at . on Amazon theres not much to lose Also I tried to purchase the foam tips by INAIRS AIR   looks like they may fit but oddly they do not sell to the US  ,thedash,d3n4wny,1,t5_30dgd

9041875,0,t1_d7yht0w,Its starting to sound like Plus is the way to go this year as well. Interesting since the components are seemingly the same. Just as they were before. There has to be an antenna in there that differs between the two.My  was shipped today so I will probably get it by Monday. I will be posting my conclusions about it here as soon as I get to test it.,thedash,d7yotap,1,t5_30dgd

9450487,0,t3_5a4mjv,There are services like shipito that will accept the item in the US repackage it and then ship it to you in SG. Its not free but is fairly reasonably priced.,thedash,d9dwzdw,1,t5_30dgd

10020341,0,t1_dbdo3em,Indeed. The major issue is the lack of support  updates and overall communication. You may forgive them for the issues if you knew what was going on as opposed to empty promises and delay after delay...Months after ordering The Headphone I ordered AirPods and will have them tomorrow. Sure they are  Euro more but they come with a battery case and I will actually have them to use too.,thedash,dbdofju,1,t5_30dgd
