10435090,0,t1_dcqsq29,We will ensure these discussions are not seen by anyone but us.Pakistani Sponsoring of TerrorismOur Research and Analysis Wing held strong suspicions of Pakistani support for the Taliban and your reports confirm these suspicions. As for actions that need to be taken we see a few key points that are of paramount importance.. The Pakistani Intelligence Service ISI as well as the Pakistani military have long histories of going rogue. History has shown various iterations of the Pakistani government cannot control them. They are also extremely dangerous with large numbers and experience.. Global pressure must be put on Pakistan to stop sponsored terrorism in the area. However their fractured systems have also allowed other terrorist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and reports of ISIS to gain a foothold in Pakistan. This is a threat to our own safety but also those of various smaller countries in the Indian subcontinent.. In this particular case our governments must work closely with the Afghanistan government to successfully stop the Taliban. This is crucial but must be well planned out ensuring that the Afghanistan government remains in control of the entire country with the Taliban gaining no power.Jammu and KashmirWe are also glad to see this from the US. Our major claim in on the currently Pakistani occupied area. However we would like to remind the US that taking a stance against Pakistan will mean that China may become involved on the side of Pakistan.War GamesThis we can fully agree to and look forward to continued ties with the US in defence and other sectors.,ModernPowers,dcqvy7a,1,t5_33f5a

11039074,0,t1_deiihlg,gtThis move is clear back pedaling by NASA and the US on statements where they have already made clear that international cooperation would not be sought on this project something that international modules flies in the face of.Do you see the part where we allowed other nations to have any say whatsoever in how the station is run? Neither did we. This was the plan from the beginning. gtThis backpedal is only occurring as NASA is finally realising an international space station might be possible without their assistance. Further this move is no more then a thinly veiled attempt to undermine any potential international project that might in anyway take away from Americas sole position as the go to on space expertise.Oh its more than possible especially if an experienced agency such as Roscosmos or CNSA is undertaking it. We are cautioning however that the ESA not attempt it due to their track record for messing up even the most basic of space activities. ,ModernPowers,dej9cum,1,t5_33f5a
