19739,0,t3_1ucbr3,Heres are  beginner tips I tell my friends You fight to survive not to DPS. Your lifebar is more important than how much damage youre doing to the monster. Dodging comes first dealing damage come second. You DO NOT want to trade blows with a monster. You will soon find that the safer you play the more openings for attacks youll see and dealing damage will come naturally.  Unless using SnS sheath your weapon A LOT. I know the animation is long sometimes but after you get a couple hits on the monster and the monster is even slightly out of range or youve evaded out the way sheath your weapon trust me. You can now run and evade much faster you have access to items and you have access to the superman dive which is a completely invincible dodge. You can still get into the fight with your weapon sheathed. If you are running and attack you can attack straight out of your weapon being sheathed and continue a combo. You can even block with your weapon put away Hold R then press X  A  Examine monster animations. Which ones leave the monster open for one or two strikes? Attack at that time and then roll and get out of the way sheath if you can so you may be prepared for the monsters next attack. Who knows his next attack could also leave him open and then the next one too! Playing safe doesnt necessarily mean playing slow. Do not get greedy. Very rarely will you pull of long combos or big finishing moves unless the monster is tripped trapped or youve practiced a lot.Those are some basic very general tips I can think of. ,MonsterHunter,cegoi24,2,t5_2rron

Note that some of the elder dragons take large chunks of slime damage at a time due to their immense health pools.

Applying sleeppara coatings and letting it rain on your monster is fun too!If youre not into range then maybe try something completely new and go with a hunting horn? I personally love playing the support role when in multi but I dont like being a pure support so hunting horn is the perfect weapon.

I think I used it up until around when i started farming zinogres. Then I made a mixed set for the end of HR Port quests. The  sets mixed one and wroggi S maxed defense on every piece carried me into Port  G rank where I am right now.

You can still use low rank armor in high rank and high rank in G rank. You just need to upgrade it to boost the defense. I was using low rank Rathalos until I made high rank Rathalos in HR. I went through all of HR and a chunk of HR in low rank armor because it had better skills than most of what I was seeing in high rank. I was using Rath Soul and Volvidon S into HR for the same reason. This is even more the case in the jump into G rank because a lot of the sets that were good in high rank took a dive in G rank.

It was a terribly bitter pill to swallow because I absolutely LOVE the SnS but... the damage output simply isnt there.

However none of these other branches are the best of their element and you shouldnt be using paralysis on a SA anyway.My preference is definitely the Nainokami because the Axe of Gaias blue sharpness is not very good.

105757,0,t1_ceqd35s,Hi!  Lets see if i can be of some help with your questions. Normally I like to start out with the Long Sword too.  I recommend going for some with Lightning andor Fire.  It feels like these are the most used elements early on.  Some suggestions would be Chainslaughter Usurpers Boltslicer Jinogua parts Thunderclap Lagiacrus parts Wyvern Blade Fire Rathalos Rathian parts.  I realize Im not recommending water but this is a path you can choose to take if you feel like it.  Water will help vs Barroth and Brachy when you get up to him. Your armor sounds about right  feel free to try and get a Barroth set.  Jumping ahead a little since it seems youre also having some issues with Poison go for a Wroggi set as well.  People seem to gush over this set since it negates poison.  Personally my early armor set progression looks like Arzuros gt Barroth gt Lagiacrus.  I always try to have fully upgraded armor as well I love to mine for some reason.  Barroth is pretty sturdy and helps vs Lagi.  I feel that Lagi armor is great for the Ceadeus fight and a lot of High Rank. My advice is to fight those monsters that give you trouble enough to the point where you can anticipate their moves.  Farm a full set of their armor and a couple of their weapons.  By that time youll have learned what to expect from them on top of building your arsenal.  As stated above  get yourself a set of Wroggi armor and try those monsters again.  Odds are that youll have a lot less trouble. You can touch Port quests as soon as youd like but I recommend tackling the lot of the Village quests first.  Theyre geared more towards a friendly solo experience.  Stuff in the Port is ever so slightly tuned to be more difficult.  I tended to bounce between the two areas but I stuck mostly to the Village content.  Once I felt like I had a decent amount of gear and was familiar with most of the fights I went for the Port quests.  Ive soloed all of the content up to the first set of G Rank quests.  G Rank doesnt feel like a wall yet just a healthy progression of difficulty.,MonsterHunter,ceqgzot,2,t5_2rron

Watch for his two attacks where he sticks his head in the ground the tells are distinct for each one he shoots a line of explosions forward and they spread a bit so optimal dodge direction is diagonally towards him and to your nearest side away from his front the other is a ring of explosions if you can just run away and dodge but if you k ow you cant watch the ground and you can see exactly where the explosions will happen and sometimes you can squeeze into a sweet spot and not get hit at all. ,MonsterHunter,cex4uyz,1,t5_2rron

203083,0,t1_cf1ffvl,Youre right to some extent. The letter r is what we use to write the phonetics in Romaji japanese words in english lettering.

Like I said previously its pronounced more with a hybrid between d and l whereby the tongue only briefly makes contactvery quick and staccatowith the roof of your mouth once. The closest thing we have to represent the sound is r and it may only sound like it in fast speech to the untrained ear. Its a very funny phonetic and for english speakers like myself it is very difficult to pronounce properly as it is an action that is not in our tongues muscle memory.

224457,0,t3_1wopot,. Simply hit it with your weapon. The more damage you deal to a part the faster you will break it. If you want to cut their tail use a weapon that deals cutting damage to attack their tail. . Yeah for some reason Jaggis armor is particularly good in low rank. The other top contenders are Wroggi for Razor Sharp that makes your sharpness go down half as fast and Volvidons armor which gives Attack and Evade.. Any monster in this game is beatable with any weapon. That being said it certainly is easier to kill things with certain weapons. If you learn a monster and practice evading times then you will almost never need a shield except in the worst circumstances. Weapons that cant block are usually more mobile than weapons that cant. Lance and Gunlance have the slowest movement speed but have the best block. Honestly my favorite weapon in the entire game is gunlance. But just remember that you can do anything you want at anytime so feel free to try out every single weapon as much as you like. There is no need to focus on a single type unless you just really want too.,MonsterHunter,cf40ere,1,t5_2rron

230640,0,t1_cf4c4x0,Id imagine that against monsters that are both huge large enough that you will never run into anyone by doing the Spirit Combo and have huge elemental weaknesses your long sword would be just fine against an elder dragon.To be honest though Ive never used a long sword against an elder dragon so I cant say from experience.  Against the Ceadeus and Goldbeard Ceadeus HBG is superior to everything else Normal  completely wrecks his day.  Against Jhen Mohran I usually bring Dual Blades but I would imagine Long Sword would work just fine too.

247355,0,t1_cf67t3c,Yup. Id love to play frontier G in English in America.. but its a bad idea. from a business stand point its a bad idea. I dont see it. Its a subscription based game so unless they could figure out a way to roll that into playstation plus or Xbox live then who knows? but on Pc people wont be playing for monthly pay time. We also dont go DLC crazy like a lot of the Asian countries do something that MHFG makes a lot of money on. The armor and weapon packs are like what? ish dollars USD a piece? Lots of people buy them. I just dont see how they could afford to do it successfully when looking at the size of the market in the west. It isnt big enough yet to support it. They need games like mhg to do well. They need to expand the franchise and do more with it in the west. Build up a following.

For Caedeus this just means getting to the third area which requires breaking his beard. If you dont break his beard the quest fails and your damage wont stack.

On a GS you will almost always be doing Triple Charges and even though you get a bonus to elemental damage when doing a triple charge it still isnt really worth losing raw for extra element. You would need absolutely massive Element to make up for losing raw to even out the damage. Elemental damage is the same for every weapon so each hit with a greatsword with  fire deals the same amount of damage as Dual swords with  fire for EACH hit.

520628,0,t3_202qbl,get the DS. For couple of reasons portable. Hunt monsters wherever and whenever! fast. There isnt any lag or frame rate issue when you play locally with friends and you can turn off the D for better frame rate. MHU. The game is coming out early next year which will also support online play. Also a lot of people including me are already at the end of endgame so there really isnt a lot of reasons preventing us from playing MHU full time. DS has better games. Seriously besides Monster Hunter there are a lot of really damn good games you can get compared to the Wii U. On the DS you can download all the eShop games onto it and play them without exchanging cartridges.I always thought I will regret getting a DS but I think this console and the games I got for it worth every penny and I got more out of it than other consoles. One of the reasons is its portability. I mean I can take it with me wherever I go on a vacationwork or commute.

However when it comes to Long Swords Id say Glacial Diva or nothing.Water Youre High Rank village right? That means Argosy Captain must have been so damn impressed with the cut of your jib that he gave you his sword. Right? Thats your Water sword. Im chomping at the bit for my Lagia Mantle and you dont even NEED Sharpness !!Poison Dont bother in LSs if youre a secondary SwAxe user. Nightshades BightBelladonas Bite is especially awful. The sharpness is terrible. Even with  you get a tiny fraction of white. If you want a poison LS Megrezs Asterism awakens to  poison doesnt need  Sharpness.However as a SwAxe user youre going to want to save those parts for Mizars Asterism The same path but SA instead of LS.

552512,0,t3_20gqsd,Slicing S wont help you if youre using a melee weapon. It allows guns that cant fire Slicing Shot to fire it. Also  points into a skill does nothing. Each piece of armor gives points towards certain skills. When your total across all equipped gear reaches  points for a skill it activates until then it does nothing. So  points of Attack doesnt affect your damage at all but  points activates Attack Up Small. Some skills have additional tiers at  and  points some have negative versions at  points. Decorations like Attack Jewel fit into slots on weapons armor and charms and add more points. Charms are an equipment slot that add points and slots but no defense or resistance points.This early in the game you wont be getting too many good charms but you might get some. I remember getting an Attack charm in low rank and that allowed me to bump Attack Up Small to Medium and Medium to Large. As for gearing for Ceadeus it doesnt give a damn about ice so youll want to switch to a different weapon. Its weakest to lightning and dragon so go for a high raw weapon a dragon weapon or better yet a Lagiacrus weapon. Your mismatched armor set likely isnt giving you any skills as the second paragraph explained which puts you at a disadvantage. Work on a full set. Ceadeus is a damage spongue so sharpness skills and damage skills are the way to go. Rathalos armor is probably the best low rank set for Ceadeus but it can be a pain to farm for so you might want something easier.,MonsterHunter,cg32sna,2,t5_2rron

There may be certain situations where one weapon time is more effective than another like bowguns being better for Ceadeus or hammer being very effective on Alatreon.

When you can get on the back get up there drop the antidragon bombs away from the cracks in the spine then attack the cracks. Once theyre broken attack the back.Use the gong and balista binder to stop its body slams and charges in the first stage. When it swims head on at the ship use the dragonator when it jumps from left to right by your perspective.In the second stage save the gong for when it tries to belly flop the ship. use it when it lifts up so the gong goes off when it reaches the peak this will flip it over and let you hit inside the mouth for huge damage. use the binder for other attacks and when the gong is charging. The important part is to protect the ship. You can see the ship danger level in the Quest Info. When you arent protecting the ship attack the legs. This will do good damage and slow it down. If you feel comfortable with his movements you can go for the belly for bigger damage.,MonsterHunter,cgoa7i6,3,t5_2rron

860108,0,t1_ch1zkw1,Thats not quite how the damage formula works.  true raw and  true element is not the same at  true raw since every part of a monster has Raw Defense and Element defense that are calculated seperately.  What he meant by Element per hit is that normal each swing of a weapon deals its element damage. which is precisely why element is pretty bad on slow weapons. A GS with  element deals the same element damage per hit as every single hit of a DS combo with  element. Well not exactly since DS has a base of  element damage. So in the time you swing a GS twice to hit for  element each swing x you can swing your DS like  times and hit for  element per hit x . This is why Element is so important the faster your weapon is. The thing about bows that is different is that EACH ARROW counts the damage individually so if you have a bow with  fire and Spread Lvl . You are effectively shooting out  element  x  Arrows if each of those arrows hits.,MonsterHunter,ch21s9m,2,t5_2rron

Besides the obvious camera issues on any platform the controls and mechanics of MH dont really fit the underwater setting like how Resident Evil  tried to be a cover based shooter like Gears of War. I think that if Capcom were to tackle underwater combat again they should redesign the gameplay to support it instead of being bogged down by the controls and camera of the land parts.Underwater combat feels like a gimmick while the improved mobility of MH feels like it actually evolves the gameplay.

1326496,0,t1_ciijemq,gt Im the only one who has used math correctly actually such as when you claimed  when it was  and my assumptions were giving you the benefit of the doubt but now I know you dont know what youre talking about. You sure are hung up over that one figure huh? Congratulations buddy you knew the modifier for weapon sharpness off the top of your head and my estimate was off by a bit. You ought to be proud of yourself.gt Purple sharpness isnt as good in MHU as it was in Tri so all of your calculations have been outdated not to mention you didnt pay attention to what I said earlier about Purple being nerfed as well as didnt know about it in the first placeJust because its been nerfed a bit doesnt mean its less necessary. gt and understand that attacking  more often means  more DPS There is absolutely no way that you are able to stay in a monsters face for  of the fight. I simply do not believe this claim. In any fight you will have periods of time where it is not possible to attack the monster and you are also not under direct threat of an attack hitting you. It is at this time when you sharpen. You are still trying to conflate the necessity to sharpen with a loss in damage output. Youre still wrong to do so.gt AuL or Crit Eye would be better for my DPS than Sharpness   on the Dire Miralis Gunlance Nice. For exactly one weapon  which it should be noted is among those that have purple sharpness without Sharpness   you have proved that another skill would allow you to do more damage. If this is going to be your argument you might as well just point to the Lucent weapons and just tell me that Sharpness  does literally nothing whatsoever.gt I will say that most of the time Sharpness   is better for Damage per hit see above for an example of an exception but it is not the be all end all of DPS and utility Most of the time is what matters. If you want to make any kind of general use set youre going to need Sharpness . Obviously there are weapons that get natural purple and therefore dont need the skill but for any weapon that doesnt get purple naturally Sharpness  is mandatory. gt if you count Purple bouncing less a utility which in this current argument it is not due to Minds EyeMinds Eye is a worthless joke of a skill. All it does is prevent the bounce animation. You still lose extra sharpness and take a damage penalty when hitting a part that would bounce. Its not worth considering in any serious discussion.gt Also I dont even want to know how much you sharpen if you sharpen right when getting to White but I hardly have to sharpen at all despite using a Gunlance meaning I have more time to deal damage DPS increase its pretty hard for small  damage increases from Sharpness level to compensate for the amount of time wasted sharpening.Ive already addressed this. Having to sharpen doesnt result in a drop in dps. Again this is why weapons like Cera Cymmetry which can hit the monster only about half a dozen times before dropping to white still see use  you just sharpen when youre free. You will always have opportunities to sharpen when you couldnt hit anything. And yes its standard to avoid dropping below your weapons maximum level of sharpness. You really should sharpen as soon as you hit white with most weapons  even when you consider how fast gunlances dull you should still be able to maintain purple consistently. I should correct you however and point out that I dont sharpen when I hit white  I sharpen whenever I cant hit a monster and I know Ive lost any significant amount of sharpness. Theres no reason to even see the white part of the sharpness bar. Whetstones are cheap and you can carry  theres no real reason to be conservative with them.gt where did you get that Blue to Purple was a  damage increase? You sure are having a field day with that estimate being off arent you? Okay so its a  increase in damage. Thats a big increase in damage. Also consider that sharpness affects elemental damage as well. Its just such a huge increase in damage that nothing can compare.gt then were pretty much done hereYou cant close off the argument like this when youre wrong. Look I know its hard to accept but you are wrong. Its just that simple. Youve convinced yourself that youre right and youre only continuing to argue with me not because you are actually invested in your point of view but because your pride wont allow you to admit that youve been wrong this whole time. Its okay just let it go. People are wrong all the time. It doesnt make you less of a person to be wrong in fact its good to be able to admit your own mistakes. However continuing on with your argument just to avoid having to admit that youre wrong is just pathetic. Like I said just let it go. No one will have any less respect for you if you admit youre wrong now and again.,MonsterHunter,ciiuj5k,1,t5_2rron

1329691,0,t3_29ax8g,Each piece of armor gives points towards certain skills. When your total across all equipped gear reaches  points for a skill it activates until then it does nothing. So  points of Attack doesnt affect your damage at all but  points activates Attack Up Small. Some skills have additional tiers at  and  points some have negative versions at  points. Decorations like Attack Jewel fit into slots on weapons armor and charms and add more points. Charms are an equipment slot that add points and slots but no defense or resistance points. Element resistances arent that big of a deal defense has a bigger effect on damage. Try all of the weapon types see which ones you like. Sharpness affects damage and how likely you are to bounce keep it high. Weapons that attack faster work best with element weapons that attack slower work best with high raw. NEVER SELL EARTH CRYSTALS. You will need hundreds. Other materials are fine to sell but try to keep a good amount of them for crafting things. I usually sell down to  of a monster material and  of an ore. Kiranico is a fantastic resource. Read the NPC dialog. A lot of people skip through it and end up stuck or think plot stuff is a glitch. Dont be that ADHD kid read the dialog know what to do and enjoy it.  When you hit a monster with a melee weapon youll see some blood come out. The larger the blood splash the more damage that part takes. If you bounce you lose twice as much sharpness parts that bounce take less raw damage so avoid them. If you find yourself getting hit by a monster a lot try just staying back and watching its attacks. Look for openings to attack in and when to dodge an attack.Greatswords do best with high raw so prioritize raw attack power meaning non element and sharpness. Charge attacks are the big damage dealers for GS try to use them as much as possible. A popular strategy is to unsheathe into a charge roll sheathe and repeat. Try doing a fight using only unsheathe attacks even if they arent charged. As you do this more youll get a feel for when you can charge and will find yourself charging more. The Focus skill helps a lot. Remember timing and positioning aim for where the monster will be not where it is now.,MonsterHunter,cij7hdb,5,t5_2rron

Shelling and Wyvern Fire lower sharpness as do your normal thrusts so paying attention to your sharpness is very important. When you first start using it GL feels very clunky. Once you get the hang of it though you can actually feel quite nimble. Once you feel a little comfortable look up Shepards GL tutorial and itll give you everything you need to know. Until then just keep in mind that you best combo is XgtXgtXAgtEvadegtrepeat.Dual swords you can kind of get away with just mashing buttons but Demon mode is a huge damage and speed buff if you can fill the gauge and the quicker dodges can be nifty and look really cool.

1575908,0,t3_2cb70y,I had been solely a blademaster until farming Zinogre got to be a chore  kills still no skymeralds and decided to try pellets in an effort to speed up the process. If youre willing to try something different Ingot X which just requires a bit of mining is an excellent start to a Zinogre set and the Precision Pico Peco is a great pellet gun and is easily made. I threw mine together just out of spare Quropeco parts no additional farming required. Strip the limiter strap on the power barrel and bring combines for more pellet . Aim vaguely in a headlike direction from about  rolls out and introduce him to the concept of dakka. If youre not interested in going the HBG route I like duals against Zinogre but SnS also works well. Hes rather mobile you want to be as well. I feel that duals give me more ability to exploit openings which is why I prefer them. Do note that the ice DBs are lackluster so if you go that route youd be better served by Spectrals or Bushido. Attack the hind legs for knockdowns then abuse his head. I prefer to go after his right hind leg as it gives me a bit more room to work with in dodging the breakdance spin jump. The usual nebulous and unhelpful advice about just having to go and learn his tells for yourself applies but in Zins case he telegraphs well so if youre still getting hit too much maybe go out and spend some time just dodging his attacks until you have a better feel for it. ,MonsterHunter,cjdtdl7,2,t5_2rron

They shouldnt really shell except to full burst after a slam which gets bonus damage. Long gunlances have a bigger blast and get a bonus to Wyverns Fire. You get only  shells but theyre more useful for actually extending your combo.Wide GLs have a large blast that has a fairly good range in all directions. It does the most damage and gets a bigger boost from charging. You only get two shells so Load Up is a good idea here.

Although the defense of mixed sets doesnt matter much now imagine losing  points in armor to get an extra skill for that perfect set? It could make a pretty significant difference allowing less expert players to make very high defense sets with somewhat poorer skills for better survival or allowing pros to make awesomely powerful sets but that are weak enough that youre likely to be one shotted by many Grank monsters.

You have to keep an eye out for the monster tells.out of stamina  salivating tripping after doing big attacksRage  Smokefirelazer out of their mouths  glowing eyesWeak  indicated by funky walkingswimmingYou manly want to worry about the weak and rage tells. You want to avoid if possible using a trap if a monster is on rage mode. The amount of time they spent in rage mode is shortened by a lot Nargacuga is the exception it will break the pitfall trap if its not enraged. When you do see them limp dont use your trap right away. From personal experience once they limp  they will try to leave the area and try to eatsleep or just escape to a different one. So you can either use a flashbomb to stop him from leaving or just wait till they go to the next area and set the trap there. Some monsters will go to sleep. If you see them sleeping just sneak up to them and set a trap next to them.Random tips lay a trap on them when they are out of stamina they will be trapped for longer allowing you to hit them more.Unlike pitfall traps Shock traps work underwater. dont use shock traps against Zinorge i dont know if it was a glitch but it looked like he powerd up from it,MonsterHunter,cjvk6wp,1,t5_2rron

1887329,0,t3_2g7vny,Interestingly I just switched from Hunting Horn to gunlance! I have  hours on hunting horn and  or so on the hammer so I can give you a little info about it. First off I believe the hunting horn can actually do more sustained damage than the hammer. This is due to a couple of differences between the weapons.The hammer is a powerhouse and the golfswing combo finisher does a whopping  damage each swing with a weapon does a  of the true raw damage as well as excellent KO to boot. However hammer attacks can be infuriatingly slow. They dont require as much timing as a greatsword charge but they do require you to accurately predict monster movement and attacks so that you have enough time to double pound gt golfswing preferably in the face. There are also a lot of very good hammers to build throughout all stages of the game hunting horn options can feel a bit lacking at points.A hunting horn in general often has around  of the raw power of a tierequivalent hammer. Each swing with the hunting horn does  to  of the raw depending on which swing is used. This lack of power seems detrimental but the value of the hunting horn is expressed through other factors. First the hitboxes on hunting horn attacks cover a great deal of space. For instance the A wiiu button attack hits low down on the far right directly in front of the hunter up high on the left and then behind the hunter on the left not  hits can only hit once. The other moves have similarly broad hitboxes making it easy to hit high up heads weakpoints monsters to the side or behind you etc. Second the speed of a single hunting horn attack is pretty fast especially in comparison to the hammer. Also nearly every hunting horn attack can flow into any other attack allowing you to quickly combo one or two hits on a monster. Third Hunting Horns self buff song allows the hunter to be incredibly fast with weapon unsheathed and to never bounce which is extremely helpful on monsters with lots of tough zones. Combine these moveset advantages with an Attack up sL song and you can put out an incredible amount of damage with the right horn. Ive had the best success utilizing the hunting horns quickness continually moving around a monster scoring fast hits in on the head with the odd strike hitboxes and playing recitals when a fairly large opening occurs. As always Im obligated to link this video. Watch how he uses the hitboxes to his advantage. Sorry for the wall of text!,MonsterHunter,ckgm5k1,5,t5_2rron

1920219,0,t3_2gkjh6,I first got into the Monster Hunter series out of a deepseated desire to find a game that could give me as much of a sense of challenge and reward as Dark Souls did.At that point around very early  I had done about several hundred hours of Dark Souls and countless more hours watching other people play the game on YouTube and Twitch. I was burnt out. I wanted something just like it. It was then that I learned of the existence of Monster Hunter. I saw that there were plenty of other Dark Souls players who also played Monster Hunter. So I began doing research on the franchise.I watched a couple of videos. I read player testimonials and reviews. The more I learned about the franchise the more I began to feel that slight itch I felt when I initially learned about Dark Souls. That itch in both cases was the persistent feeling that I just had to play this game. So I immediately bought myself a PSP and both Monster Hunter Portable rd and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. I started off with Portable rd. True to what reviewers have consistently said about the game the first several hours are slow. You gather. You farm. You mine. Then I got to the point where I could fight my first Great Jaggi. It took me about  minutes. To someone who never played a Monster Hunter game this  minutes might seem like forever but when youre the one playing it you dont feel those minutes pass. It was incredibly satisfying to whittle down that Great Jaggi from proud and energetic to broken and limping. In the first  or so hours I continued to play Portable rd my hurdles included Barioth getting carted  times per fight and taking  minutes per fight Rathalos always draining my resources and mentally tiring me out and Diablos triple carting within the first  minutes. Now that Ive played literally over  hours of Portable rd I have gotten to the point where Barioth only takes me  minutes Rathalos takes  and without any Mega Potions and even Black Diablos I can down in  minutes so long as I bring plenty of Flash Bombs and Sonic Bombs. Ive also at this point invested about  hours in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. I have to say at this point as a personal preference that I find Monster Hunter even more satisfying than Dark Souls. By the time you get to the point of a Souls games where an enemys health defense and attack power are all maxed out called New Game Plus  nothing has really changed in Dark Souls. You are still facing the same enemy with the same movesets albeit with more health attack power and defense. Otherwise nothing changes.But by the time you get to endgame Monster Hunter highrank in MHP and GRank in MHFU you are fighting enemies with far more advanced movesets and higher aggression. You also meet enemies in Grankhighrank that you dont meet at lower ranks. This is of course in addition to having more health defense and attack power.A lowrank Yian Garuga is a completely different experience from a Grank Yian Garuga. A lowrank Zinogre is childs play compared to a highrank Zinogre. I really am looking forward to MHU. It looks to be the most challenging Monster Hunter game released thus far. I have been watching videos of people fighting regular enemies and feral versions of those same enemies. Even within the same enemy rank regular and feral versions are entirely different enemies altogether in terms of aggression and power. I really cant imagine how terrifying it would be to fight Grank feral enemies.,MonsterHunter,ckkkn7l,1,t5_2rron

I dont see it as likely for any totally new monsters to show up besides Steve and an endgame Elder Dragon precedent supports my prediction.

But in rd Gen you only get X damage with Melee but X with Ranged and items. In order to get the super pound stand maybe a foot further away from the enemy not right up on him so that the upward attack misses but the superpound will hit him.,MonsterHunter,ckqghz6,3,t5_2rron

I do not by all means preorder any other games aside from MH because I honestly do not know what to expect perhaps the gameplay is terrible or it is badly optimized as someone on PC this happens sometimes. With MH you already know that you are going to be satisfied and it is going to be an  amazing experience due to the core gameplay structure bing kept constant with previous entries and the fact that CAPCOM has gotten a reputation for not messing up anything in every entry to the series. Besides in this case MHU is MH but better and we already know how MH plays and how good it is so if anything it being MHU is even more a reason to preorder.,MonsterHunter,ckqq8gc,8,t5_2rron

2069271,0,t3_2ik520,Heres my advice for Low Rank.First of all make two Bone Busters.Upgrade the first one to the Queens Longfire.  Thats a gun that youre going to be using during your entire HBG career especially at the endgame when it becomes the Empresss Garden.  Its pretty much going to be your go to HBG if you dont have a better one for a hunt.  It has very large Normal  and Normal  clips it will always have lots of slots once upgraded endgame it has three slots it fires Poison S for additional damage and it has no deviation.Upgrade the second one to the Tropeco Gun and keep that one upgraded too.  Until the endgame the Peco gun is going to be your best Pellet HBG.  The Nether Salvatore is actually the best Pellet Bowgun if you add Use Any Pellet S to your armor set.The Lagia Blitz is also a good gun to make if you dont mind hunting down a few Lagiacrus to do it.  Having a gun that can Siege Fire Normal  is a good plan and it upgrades to one of the most powerful HBGs in the endgame as well the Nether Salvatore.EDIT As for armor sets just like with Blademaster the Wroggi armor is fine for Low Rank.  Normal Up is a really good skill.  If you really would rather have Evade Extender at Low Rank get the Lagombi armor.When you get to High Rank you will definitely want to consider looking for a set that has Evade Extender.  Barioth U Sand Barioth is pretty much going to be one of your better options at that point.,MonsterHunter,cl2ulr9,8,t5_2rron

Look up the elemental weaknesses in case you need themYou may find though that gunlance doesnt work for you against a particular monster. Dont be afraid to switch things up in those cases. You might find that hammer or lance or whatever makes the fight easier. I hammer or SnS most things on land but underwater I nearly always use lance for instance. For a select few damage sponges looking at you Grank Jhen I use greatsword and there are a few monsters where I want to be nowhere near that I use bow for.

2364538,0,t3_2mggvo, Every single item online is instance based. Meaning that everyone you play with will get their own gathering points carves and quests items separate from each other. There is no friendly fire damage wise. None of your teammates will ever take damage from your weapon. Bombs however can damage anyone they hit although they dont deal a lot. Keep in mind though that while your attacks dont actually deal damage you can hit your team and trip them up or send them flying. Since you use SA watch out for the big Upswing in Axe mode. That attack will send anyone it hits flying through the air. Also the ThrustgtExplosion attack in Sword Mode will knock people flying across the ground. Your other attacks with only slightly stagger people so its not a terribly big deal. Dont overstress about hitting other people too much. If you arent actively going out of your way to hit people most of us dont care about the accidental upswing every now and then. It happens. But just always try to be aware of your team and where they are and what they are doing. Some attacks of certain weapons such as Charging a Greatsword will get invincibility from staggers so you dont have to worry about staggering them with basic attacks however you can still send them flying. Other tips include that if you are the Host of a room and you are quitting please let people know you are leaving. If the host leaves the room everyone else gets disconnected. Its super nice of the host to let people know so that they can leave the room really quick before the Host quits. If you need a specific monster search for a room for that monster join a Turns room or create a room yourself. Nobody likes the guy who joins a random room and posts a quest. If you have a USB Keyboard you can plug it into your WiiU for much easier communication if you dont feel like using the voice chat. I find its much more fun playing with people who communicate then people who silently post quests for everyone to do.

Which direction to dash to when he starts coiling up for a water beam.

2443866,0,t1_cmdmuow,Yes the weapons all work a little differently. Mostly they are slightly more simple than their rd gen counter parts. For instance long sword has a th move added to its spirit combo in rd gen and when you complete this move you can power up you spirit gauge up to  times.  You have only one level of the spirit gauge in MHFU.  Similarly dual blades dont have archdemon mode in MHFU.  And yeah the hitboxes are wonky as hell some times.  Also foot shuffling.

Just make sure to always pack Tremor Res.What I do think is a crutch is infinite stamina as it allows you to be careless with your stamina usage and is a situation you can end up in suddenly because you forgot to bring enough or the hunt is running longer than expected and Bam!

Id recommend grabbing a set that will boost your overall damage and just gemming in the Maestro skill since it isnt that hard to do. Youll need the gems anyways since Maestro can only be found on Qurupeco X in G Rank. Volvidon is a good idea giving AuS Evasion  and Tremor Resist.

2827658,0,t3_2sh59g,TLDR The gameplay is amazing and the progression is rewarding no matter how long youve had a character......You get to pick which weapon fits your playstyle the best and can change at any time. You can make a suit of armor that you like for whatever reason and still feel like youre not useless. The monsters have good variety in terms of how they should be fought. Combat is more dynamic than running up to mobs and mashing skills until you see the health bar which strangely floats over their head become empty. The game isnt a glorified movie where the only time you actually do anything is when you are walking between point A and point B as you fight enemies by going up to them and pushing the kill it now button.In the beginning you have almost nothing. First you build up a stash of basic things like potions meat and materials. Then you start getting slightly better weapons and armor. You build up a better stash of items things like flash bombs or pitfall traps and they make hunts easier. Your gear keeps improving until you are good enough to say I want this very specific set of things which are hard to get and when you actually have them all it feels good to put it all on and go wreck some shit with it. You feel like a badass when someone looks at your set of gear and compliments it and youre unlikely to find yourself standing next to three other people all wearing the same stuff that you have on.At first you struggle to quickly kill even the easiest of the large monsters or kill them at all depending on how good you are. Then you get better at spotting patterns in each fight and finding openings. Eventually you can maximise your damage output by dodging attacks or using items in creative chains. This happens for all fights and also for each weapon which you choose to use for a fight it can even be affected by the skills that your armor set has.You can play casually and enjoy the challenge of progressing through content. You can play slightly less casually and enjoy the challenge of making gear. You can take the time to learn how to use different types of weapons. You can put in tons of effort to perfect your fighting skills and solo content which less skilled groups of people struggle to complete.,MonsterHunter,cnpi06j,6,t5_2rron

Once it fills you lose the ability to heal naturally.  The red in the health bar doesnt even show up. Nulberrys only reset the meter and once it fills youre stuck with the effect until it wears off. Although if you deal enough damage while this bar is filling to anything  not just the monster that infected you itll give you a  affinity boost instead of the debuff. So its kinda worth just going for since it doesnt actually take your health. Just sucks when he flys to another area while you have the meter.,MonsterHunter,cnrvv08,1,t5_2rron

The cstick doesnt feel cluttered or anything there will be enough room for you thumb there easily and you dont need to move it much. I dont have a CPP so I dont know if the cstick is better than it but I prefer playing on my NDSXL over my DSXL.

Earplugs is great for mostly melee if your already at its feet while it roars it gives you time to follow up with large combosIE GS charge lvl  or SA charge attack in sword mode This can usually if timed right stagger or knock over the monster. On ranged the opening doesnt matter to much except for HBG as they can go into siege mode though earplugs are not as useful since they might not have been in range of the roar anyways.,MonsterHunter,cnv3ch2,4,t5_2rron

If you can get the diablos with a sonic and then time it right you can also get a flashbomb in when the monster recovers from being stuck. You just have to hold off and not be too greedy on the sonic opening then stand next to under it facing the head and throw the flash a little early as it will fail if the mon is already in the landing animation. ,MonsterHunter,co3jw8i,1,t5_2rron

2954764,0,t1_co3wnak,Reach is not a problem excellent mobility while unsheathed a bit less in axe mode but you should not be in axe mode for too long anyways deal a large amount of elemental damage with a elemental phial KO faster and easier than a hammerhuntinghorn with a KO phial Can block and counter with it if you block with charged shield you can make a little explosion with your shield dealing even more KO or elemental damage.I might add that the explosion attacks deal a massive amount of damage along with the fact that the KO ones dont really need to be at the head just near it since the little explosions have a radius.What I dislike is that most weapons in monster hunter have different play styles that have some drawbacks to them. For example SnS and DS have quick attacks and fast mobility but they dont have reach GS is powerful as hell and high reach but you need to do some hit and run and lvl charges and so on. But the CB has little to none drawback.While what DrZeroH said is kinda true for some people Im seeing many new people instantly loving the CB.,MonsterHunter,co3yypc,1,t5_2rron

Its just that some games fastest possible runs arent so.... speedy.With a series like Monster Hunter where hunters put in an average of  hours a speedrun would be quite difficult to do unless there are only shortterm goals such as the low rank run you mentioned.Anything is possible though and even if it is just a low rank speedrunrace I would still enjoy watching! So good luck with it if you decide to try and do a speedrun! Itll probably be pretty fun gt,MonsterHunter,co6akr6,1,t5_2rron

It can clear mooks.  It can deal KO damage  It can cut tails and smash heads with both accuracy and power.Need to put out mad damage?  Greatsword charge swings.  Bam.  As an added bonus level  charges have builtin Minds Eye never bounce again.Jaggi swarm getting you down?  Roundhouse swing them into next week.  Then knock out some wimpy deer and make some Ancientpotions on the fly.Rathalos backflips causing you prolonged pain?  Chop that damn tail off even if its flying.  And then supercharge its head.  You know you want to.Friends showing up?  Great!  Theyll create more windows for you to cleave bone and shred muscle.  You can even send them flying if theyre about to be nuked!  Gratitude levels may varyNow you may be thinking Gee sounds like some wimpy utility weapon.  You couldnt be more wrong.  With some of the highest raw damage available Greatswords will make quick work of any monster.  While dual swords users flounder about trying desperately to match elements and become relevant again you get to keep chopping away.  After all while you can resist fire or lightning nothing truly resists a guillotine of pure death aimed at its squishy bits.Greatsword.

3062634,0,t3_2v8l7h,I feel the same way as you. Ive played  hours of MHU the only MH game Ive played and while I consider myself above average Im nowhere near good.

Hunt a monster over and over and your ability to hunt it will only improve be it by learning its attack patterns or just by mastering how to use your weapon against it.The people that play like god on the speedruns we see around are most of the time people that have been playing MH for a long time with thousands of hours across multiple games.

Initially you might take a good hour or two to do some quests where you gather basic materials and learn the game.  You can do these quests very quickly if you want but as a new player you will probably take some time to learn the systems and explore a bit.Once you start getting into quests prep is Pick a quest Set you inventory Maybe check on your town stuff like the trader Eat before the fightA few minutes of prep for experienced players.,MonsterHunter,cofo7fs,1,t5_2rron

MHU you CAN go back itll just feel sluggish which may ruin your experience. Onto the good news about MHU though. A lot of the monsters are not returning to MHU Including Nargacuga which was one of my favourite fights so it will be worth your time to fight different monsters.Ill be dropping MHU but  hours later Im comfy saying I can drop it and still have gotten my moneys worth on that one.Alas for you.... thats a decision youll have to make.

3088960,0,t3_2vfwjm,I understand the difficulties of a first time player but what this review is isnt just that. Its ignorance and whining. He clearly came into this review without the slightest inking of knowledge about the game. He looks at movements that are balanced and a completely a part of the game as flawed because he has no idea what hes talking about. Can you imagine how broken MH would be if you could use items unsheathed and as fast as you could chug an Estus in Dark Souls?This reviewer is like a guy playing chess and complaining about the limitations of piece movements. Bishop cant go up and down? King can only move one space? Omg that is so stupid! Its a core part of the game. And when I read he was controlling the camera by using a stylus I knew all hope for this review was lost. He did poorly blamed the game and proceeded to get carried. He says he saw  man hunts as what the game was supposed to be but hes wrong. A regular hunter doesnt need  minutes to kill a monster. But he rather not face the fact that he was just playing very very poorly. All in all this is another review that should be ignored ala .  Too Much Water. ,MonsterHunter,coi63ft,1,t5_2rron

In Synaptics drivers you can adjust how sensitive the touchpad is as well as give other commands to stuff like holding  fingers apart on it for  seconds. My favorite feature is their chiral scrolling which lets you make circles on the touchpad with the initial touch originating near the corners to scroll. You can adjust how bigsmall the corneredge zones are as well for scrolling. I havent found a touchpad yet that wont use Synaptics drivers and gain something out of it.

3110432,0,t3_2vrybj,gt it can wear off after a whilePaint balls always wear off after some time its not an occasional thing. Im sure you didnt mean it like that but I wanted to clear up any confusion. If youre bouncing off a monster that means your weapons sharpness is too low the color of the weapon in the top left indicates sharpness. Either try a weapon with higher sharpness or attacking a different part of the monster. Dont be afraid to use items but dont let them be your crutch either. Once youre well into the game your goal should be using as few potions and the like as possible. Some special cases are using sonic bombs for Diablos since it likes to spend half the fight underground. If youre having trouble with a monster instead of running in like a doof and getting your butt kicked again stay back and watch how the monster acts. Watch what moves it uses after other moves and watch for when it stands around since those are your greatest opportunities to attack. ,MonsterHunter,coke8da,21,t5_2rron

3155143,0,t3_2wac79,I cant help you with bowguns since I dont use them but you can practice melee weapons with the few that are given to you at the start of the game or by doing the training quests in the star village quests. If openings are too short you can try to use quicker weapons like the dual swords the sword and shield the long sword or the charge blade.In general you want to know the monster you are facing so it is easier to fight. I beat the daimyo hermitaur the crabinthesand yesterday and it gave me a really tough time because I got surprised by its attacks. I did it again knowing its attack patterns and with a weapon with more mobility since I always got caught in its sidestep bubblelaser and I wrecked him. Its attacks still damaged me a lot but I was able to dodge them more consistently.Also dont forget to eat before hunts in this case you can use bread and veggies to gain a defense and a water resistance boost and get higher healthstamina.For armor you can try to get some with high water resistance and higher defense but you should be able to do it if you are familiar enough with its attack patterns. I did it with the nerscylla armor.

Maybe its cuz I use type  controls.  Also its still good to ko monsters.With that said arc sucks in general.  The shots dont do that much dmg.  They take too long.  And worst of all they are unusable in like  percent of the areas along with being unusable in every lower level with an upper net.  But if you look at power shot bows most take a hit in power or something else like charge levels.  So I think its a trade off.  Also it burns through stamina.

3167624,0,t3_2wfhyq,Great Jaggi nest in the upper left of that area map btw. MOST creatures sleep there with a few exceptions most dragons roost in the area at the top of area  and the Seletas rests against a wall in Area  making it very difficult to attack out of sleep for some weapons.The great Jaggi is deceptive because it runs away in the opposite direction of where it ends up to go to sleep.,MonsterHunter,coqbmn8,1,t5_2rron
3167814,0,t1_coqap9q,Sword and Shield is a classic beginner weapon. That doesnt mean its bad just that its a very easy weapon to use because it doesnt have any complicated controls like most other weapons do. The same can be said for Great Sword although its extremely slow speed can really punish beginners. Long Sword is a good inbetween weapon that offers good speed damage and reach and it still has pretty easy controls. But dont hesitate to try out them all. Youll find a lot of people saying they play mainly with one weapon type. Personally I try to use just about everything. It makes you better overall and for some monsters you find that one weapon type is easier to use on it than others.,MonsterHunter,coqcc3t,5,t5_2rron

3228425,0,t1_cowi0pc,Decent advice mixed with terrible terrible generalizations.gt Dont bother with HBGs until you can remove the Limiter End of HRGR entry.Advice for people trying HBGs dont use HBGs.  Are you out of your mind?  Theyre a  viable and usable weapon right from the start of the game your opinion on crouching fire aside.  Crouching fire by the way is very good fun and satisfying to use and Ive been able to get a full  shots of Normal  off very easily online.  Hell I finish CF clips often enough offline too.gt Bowguns Anything with deviation is garbage.If you have  hunts with HBG and cant handle deviation to the point where any weapon with it is garbage I dont think much of your ability to shoot accurately.  The only deviation to be worried about is combined LR deviation and even then only when youre using pierce and its Severe.  Deviation in this game just doesnt deviate so much that even Severe deviation in a single direction isnt much of a problem if you as you easily can take it into account.Like you comment on latergt However small deviation in any direction is barely noticeable unless at distances far beyond critical ranges.Gosh!  I have to keep in mind with this gun to aim the crosshair a little to the side or in the case of normal gunning often it doesnt even matter and flies straight enough anyway!  What a garbage weapon right?It is seriously one of the simplest things to work with.gt Rapid fire is fun but can get you caught in some bad positions.Rapid fire is no worse in getting you in bad positions than say using a hammer or whatever.  Rapid fire is fun sure and its also the most important part of using an LBG to pump out lots and lots of statuselemental on the monster.,MonsterHunter,cowmpza,16,t5_2rron

I try to give him the benefit of the doubt  maybe hes got close range coatings on. Hes not using a Seregios bow but maybe he just likes the coatings. This continues for a little while and he starts to get on my nerves because he hardly leaves melee range and hes constantly in the way of myself and the other Blademaster. Occasionally he shoots us.

The best defense is a good offense as they say. NormalPiercePellet Up depending on your gun and target Recoil as needed and Evade Extender are the big skills for HBG. Reload Speed can help but usually isnt too big of a deal. Once you get the hang of dodging with HBG switch to power barrel for even more damage. The shield attachment is pretty limited in use.

3325199,0,t1_cp7ao2s,Yes if you consider GS skills the final Ukanlos GS is generally just as goodvery slightly superior to Cera and is most likely the best raw GS you can get right now.

Will actually tend to trigger their backflips and spins quite a bit if you stay under their legs this might be the problem the op is having. Hit and run is always a good tactic on the monster type when they arent fatigued usually after a spin or charge that window you see is more often than not going to immediately followed with another spin or a backflip. Dont be greedy while they are in dive bomb  charge mode hits on the extremes fail and face are safer to sidestep away from after a quick hit or two. When they exhaust. Let it rip! Hope this help guard up with your power d shield will also do you wonders in a quick defense if you want to unleash a bit while fighting at the legs. ,MonsterHunter,cp7t66o,1,t5_2rron

3334024,0,t1_cp85nfb,So we used standard pathfinder I found an awesome weapon generator  website and every one in the party got a weapon.      A bard who is now a barbarian and gonna be a monk got a dwarven longsword of power so I figured hey dwarves are good with mechanics so its gonna be a reverse switch Axe.      One guy is a war priest ironically h got a celestial longsword of eternal slumber. It allowed him to crit and insta kill medium size creatures or smaller. With big creatures he did like x damage.     Another guy is a brawler and doesnt use weapons  and he got a longsword that flies I kid you not the guy who doesnt need weapons got one that flies... Anyways so I allowed him and the sword to communicate telepathically and it helps him grapple monsters because it distracts them.    The fourth and final character was an illusionist named Loki who in the weapon generator amazingly got a staff of lighting. Im essentially making him a kirrin he runs really fast shoots ridiculous amounts of lighting its awesome.    So my friends dont and havent played monster hunter they have no interest sadly I try and try but I digress... A lot... Anyways so ya big characters getting bigger gave them belts for more health and defensive stats they got bombs they could use to hurt and break things on the monster. Gave them potion abilities like the game its great.,MonsterHunter,cp8azap,1,t5_2rron

It includes timing positioning length of windows etc. It also usually includes which combos are guaranteed to have openings at the end. Usually they are an all encompassing guide on parsing the monsters attacks.

3353833,0,t3_2yl7tr,There are  different ranksdifficulties in this game Low Rank High Rank and GRank theres technically post Grank in this game but thats something else.Hunter rank HR technically has nothing to do with difficulty and only marks your progress within the Tavern.I believe its Hunter Rank HR  that is counted as Low Rank and then HR  that is High Rank.  After beating High Rank your HR becomes unlocked and can go up to . Grank follows this and it has its own subranking system G G G and then the  GCrowns.  However all these Granks are the same difficulty.Caravan starts you out in Low rank.  It will always be low rank until a certain point in the game at which point it will be clearly obvious that you are in High Rank it will really be painfully obvious.  However you will always have the option to go back and do Low Rank quests.EDIT Quests do technically get more difficult the more stars it has but only because it pits you against different monsters more monsters at once.,MonsterHunter,cpak89i,1,t5_2rron

3357170,0,t1_cpawo5q,Time for some Gore Magala ecology!Their horns are actually feelers like the feelers that slugs or snails have although they probably originally evolved from horns.And Gore Magala are blind until they shed their hide and molt into Shagaru Magala  their eyes are underneath their scalesskin.However unlike Khezu instead of  relying on smell their feelers are able to detect the Frenzy Virus in their immediate vicinity. The Virus latches onto its dander that the fur on its wings constantly shed into the air allowing it to essentially see anything within its cloud of dander or that gets infected by the Virus. This is why upon becoming enraged they extend their feelers to increase their surface area effectively improving their vision. They dont keep them out constantly because theyd be more likely to be injured if they did.Whether the Frenzy Virus is naturally produced by the Gore Magalas body or not is never really touched upon. My theory is that it isnt technically a virus at all but a kind of bacteria that evolved a symbiotic relationship alongside the species. This bacteria probably releases a certain chemical into the air and the Magalas feelers have evolved to detect trace amounts of the molecules of this chemical.,MonsterHunter,cpaxxe6,60,t5_2rron

There is some behindthescenes math like your raw being divided by a number that varies between weapon classes and different attack motions dealing varying percentages of the weapons damage.With poison you have a  chance of inflicting the listed value divided by . It does nothing until youve applied enough poison to reach the threshold at which point the monster starts having the poisoned abnormal status. How much damage this deals varies from monster to monster but has nothing to with the poison number on your weapon.,MonsterHunter,cpbd3qq,3,t5_2rron
3361314,0,t1_cpbe0xv,If a monster is drooling and its actions become slow and sluggish its fatigued and is likely going to find some food if it leaves. It can also cancel out fatigue if it gets enraged before it eats. When a monster is weak enough it will start limping there are some exceptions to this Diablos for example. This means that it is almost dead. If it leaves an area while limping it is running away to go to sleep. Every monster will always go to sleep in the same location.As far as I know sleeping monsters cant regenerate health past the point where they would have been limping anyway. The reason you want to let it sleep is because the hit that wakes up the monster does x I think damage. Thats generally when people use bombs because they will do massive damage. Even if no one has bombs if someone did something like a charged greatsword attack that would still do a ton of damage. It also makes setting traps up for capturing easier. Let them sleep set up a trap right next to them wake them up throw tranq bombs and youre done.,MonsterHunter,cpbexxm,2,t5_2rron

It looks pretty neat you get two analog sticks and the Vita is in every way perceivable the better console. It just feels really good in your hands. MHFU also is a worthy investment and the content isnt even that different to U. You have a lot of monsters U doesnt have and vice versa. The gameplay is more fluent in U but really it doesnt hurt as much as you would think. Only downside for the Vita and the reason I picked up a DS aside from MHFU you have little to no games on that thing.

Sharpness  is requirement at high levels because purple sharpness adds a lot of damage and helps prevent bouncing over white sharpness. However at lower levels most weapons wont gain any sharpness levels and even if they do it will be a tiny bit of blue sharpness which is a very minimal damage increase. In low rank you rarely need higher than green sharpness anyway.,MonsterHunter,cpg3luo,1,t5_2rron

I dont know if youve played other Monster Hunters but the game is all about patience and eventually learning the bosses patterns hitboxes and your own iframes. For the weapons you do feel comfortable with definitely practice with all of them and see what works best for you. None will be easy and it may take awhile but eventually youll master one and be fine. If you even wanted to Id skype with you or etc. because MH is always more fun when youre communicating with your teammates. Youd have to PM me or ask ingame.,MonsterHunter,cphe7xv,2,t5_2rron

Weapons that have super armour like Longsword and Insect Glaive can stack up and wail on the monsters without much of a problem but when youre using a weapon without it its your job to stay away from the group and their job to stay away from you. In terms of Hammers your priority is to aim for the head all day every day and no one else expect arguably Great Swords should be getting in the way of you doing that. If you are aiming the head and your team wont get off your back tell them to stop or find a new group.

Otherwise they are useless because they cant do any damage.DB users are dizzy.Hammer users ALWAYS superpound even if the monster is already downed. Some dont know the superpound exists and just spin slowly at the monster.HH users are pacifists.Lance users are thought to be nonexistant and are a rare sight to see. They will always charge straight through you however.Gunlance users have no concept of positioning and will constantly blast you and the other players whether or not they realize they are.SA users will always go for the tail and circle the monster like a LVL  Palico that doesnt know how to fight once its hacked off.CB users will always go for the stylish Ultra Burst regardless of the damage or efficientcy.Some say IG users have never felt the ground in their entire life.LBG users do their best to proc status on a monster but the other players do the exact wrong thing when the status is procced so they just leave.HBG users do a lot of damage well they would if they were hitting the monsters weak spot.Bow users try to inflict status like LBG but cant because they stay out of critical range and end up doing no damage at all.,MonsterHunter,cpjgkx4,3,t5_2rron

All it requires is a Basarios GQ Speed Gather and one other person to help keep your GQ in low rank. Blast dual blades work the best but arent required.. Depart on your Basarios GQ.. Mine all the way to the Basarios. . Aim for his feet the entire time and topple him over.. Sheath as soon as he starts to topple.. Mine  times only if you can start as soon as the mining point is available. Repeat  through  until it dies. I was getting  or  topples per run. Its a  chance to mine earth crystals on his back.

3448623,0,t3_2zp2nd,The Gore Magala LR one is pretty good for Spread damage and power shot with power coatings to amplify the damage also has paralysis and poison for utility. I took down the  Shagaru Magala with it in about  minutes so its plenty strong if you aim shots well.Tigrex bow is also pretty solid as well. Those are the ones I would look at for Low Rank.

Good affinity on the glaive and armor combined with the bombardier boost can be devastating.

3451296,0,t1_cpl89nd,Yeah back in MH all I ever used was a bow but when I mined this LBG at the volcano I figured Id give it a shot. Imagine my wonderment when i fired three shots at once that all exploded in the monsters face KOing it. It was quite the eyeopener.,MonsterHunter,cploaoh,1,t5_2rron
3451496,0,t1_cplizzc,gt  I could just run around spamming charged shots at the right distance and expect good times. So much for that.Thats sort of the issue here. The Bow isnt as simple as just throwing arrows at your target you need to position yourself properly to avoid taking damage get in whatever shots you can not misswaste coats unnecessarily if possible so on and so forth. Theres a high skill floor yes floor meaning a high required level of skill to match kill times with other weapons and it is also very dependent on monster. Aim for weakspots as much as you can. The higher the shot hitzone the more damage you do and the more you get out of your coats and shots.There are some monsters that are very easy to Bow AkantorUkanlos are notable examples JinougaS.Jinouga Gore to a lesser extent but some monsters are really tricky particularly those with hard hitting gap closing attacks Tigrex for example.This also sounds silly but consider abandoning your cats for some hunts. Some hunts go a lot better when you are the only thing a monster will target. This is for a few reasons such as  the monster will always turn to face you or in other words more opportunities for head shots and  you can move around knowing full well that you wont get caught in the collateral of an attack not meant for you but for your palico teammate. Since youve played with a Greatsword you are probably aware of how useful having a monster target you can be to get your charged swipes off with good positioning. Same idea with the Bow really.There is a reason why you rarely see Bow users online and of those that you do see only an even smaller subset of those really know what they are doing. It is a really demanding weapon to use. ,MonsterHunter,cplp483,2,t5_2rron

Back then it was harder becuase there was ONLY green sharpness and killing him took coordination and effort since he would regularly come very close to destroying the defenses and you failing the quest.  Ceadus fight is pretty much the same when its in the beginning as Lao.

3519790,0,t1_cpth9k3,The Power Shots and Arc Shots should be considered supplementary shots. DO NOT spam them. The Power Shot has a long backswing animation where you just stand there waiting that can get you hit. Use the Power Shot when you can get both shots in and the backswing animation without being punished but please do not spam it.A lot of people believe that the Power Shot is something that must be spammed or that Power Shot bows are always better. Thats not always true. The Arc Shot can be good for hitting monsters outside of critical distance applying status coatings breaking parts that you cant reach easily like Ukanlos and Akantor backs and applying KO status if you hit the head this is a lot harder than it sounds.The Power Shot shoots the next charge level shot available. For example if you have a Charge  Spread shot and a Charge  Pierce shot if you let loose a Charge  shot and do a power shot it will shoot the Charge  pierce shot. In the case where you only have a Charge  shot like the Seregios Bows and their Load Upd Charge  Rapid shots the Power Shot will shoot another Charge  shot.The Bow eats up a lot of stamina only if you are poor with your stamina management. That means you dont want to keep an arrow held for long draw and fire on a weak spot dont keep the arrow drawn for long if you cant get your shot in roll with Y when you roll with Y you dont lose your coating but you also sheathe the arrow in a sense. Power Shots drain your stamina use them wisely and make sure all the shots land in critical distance. Use Power Shots sparingly when they are useful but dont spam them.The easy way is to use Dash Juice but I havent found a significant need for it unless I really really really really really need something dead.,MonsterHunter,cpthd06,2,t5_2rron

3524250,0,t1_cptu439,Yeah thats true no one is perfect.I personally would choose Speed Sharpening and Evade over Evade because I think I would be utilizing the sharpening more than those extra frames.I dont know which moves require those extra frames and my timing probably isnt consistant enough to nail those moves that do as that would be a tight timing window. If I fail the evade on a move that does need it the skill is wasted because I didnt use it correctly. If the move doesnt require it instead requiring only  or even no evasion at all the skill is wasted. Plus by shortening my evasion window I can learn to use smaller windows and improve my timing for times I do use higher Evasion skills.On the other hand I know I will very likely be sharpening unless Im running with an efficient group. The skill will let me get back into the fight much more quickly than without. This is especially true in fights where I cant zone.Perhaps moves requiring Evasion are more prevalent than I believe but until I know for now I think Id rather have another Cskill.But if I do have Evasion with only  slots including a slot available though Evasion it is.

3548481,0,t3_30xksw,Im G. Selfish charity like his has no place here. One of my personal rules is that if I join a lowerranked room to clear my quest list I do what THEY want. This is their journey Ive already walked it dont spoil it for them. Also I do not post quests outside the scope of the room without asking first. Scope is defined as containing the target. For example NO for Gozmagios in a Seregios room. YES for Urgent Seregios in a Seregios room make sure they actually have Drive though. YES for Brute TigrexBlack Gravios combo in a Brute Tigrex room. YES for Double Brute Tigrex in a BT roomThe last two are stretch goals with conditional yess. Expect them to have lower priority than singletons if two others sign up for a singleton better get with the program or get out. Furthermore if I post a stretch goal that might be leading people to their deaths I take responsibility theyre going out on a limb to fulfill my needs after all.That means a voucher. That means lifepowders and dusts of life.Like I said. Selfish charity has no place here. If he wants fellow hunters to go out of their way for him he better make it worth their while.

Ive been farming  shaggy by  dodging underneath him every time he aggros on me.  However some need evasion but not evade extender.  I know that only using evasion on jho lets you stay underneath him constantly using evade  extender may hurt you there.Try to predict monster moves to use wyvernfire as quickly as possible.

3583757,0,t1_cq0rsdm,A dragon thats metal is much less creative. Metal dragons are pretty damn common actually. Look around. They exist and tend to be what comes after the generic Im red so Im a fire dragon ones. The metal ones are normally followed after that by the multiheaded ones. And then after that I think the super massive ones.Generally if theres a multielement dragon it has multiple heads and is really just a hydra thing. So for it to be one dragon is pretty damn uncommon. Most elemental dragons are one element and coloured the same IE Red is fire blue is water or ice so on blah boringThe only lazy aspect of Alatreon is true of ALL monsters and that is they love to recycle animations on monsters. IE Know how Kushala does that turn towards you hand slap thing? Alatreon and Teostra do it too. Know how Rathian does that turn around tail thing? Yeah everything does that.As far as appearance goes Alatreon does not look generic at all aside from obviously being shaped like a dragon.His armour depends on if you mean the male or the female armour. The Female armour looks fine but I havent seen the male and if were going to bash the armours... Why dont we look at the doofus overbite lip on Kushalas helmet? At the very least on the female variantIf youre honestly going to claim Kushala is less generic than Alatreon... I mean cmon. LOOK at Kushala before you make a claim.The more generic you claim Alatreon is the more generic youre admitting Kushala is. Im not saying Alatreon doesnt have some aspects that are generic but you seem to be claiming Kushala is the first and only metal dragon ever.

For rajang I can only ko him once with meastro and usually dont get the ko without it .By no means a end all be all skill for Hh but just want to add my opinion. I have mained hh for a long time and I have plenty of sets with it and plenty without it. I just look at it as an offensive skill for five slots.

3593538,0,t3_31iign,Take the time in a group hunt preferably  players and look around to see how the other  plays.Some IG keep spamming mount attacks and missing players focusing on attacking when at half life instead of just sheathing and healing up and there still are players trying to get in attacks during a mount. At other times you can find that very cautious player who only gets in one or two hits before retreating a safe distance or that player who refuses to stop aggroing the monster and lure him to a trap. After a while you can gauge a players proficiency just by watching them play with their weapons. Generally as of now players I encounter above HR are generally good to goAlso even though theres a key quest system theres no incentive to farm a monster in LRHR more than once it more than once unless youre looking to get equipment. You can get G crown by fighting only  or  gravios ever and obviously you wont be proficient with themDoing offline campaigns is often not a good measure of skill in G rank as these players can just farm HRGrank armor and go back and clear all the LRHR quests in caravan for the rainbow pigment. If youre in HRLR with wystone thats usually a good indicator of your competency thoughFor me the best way to judge a players abilities aside from their HR is their armor and weapon. For example GS users should probably be using ukanlosseregiosdiablos GS and element users should always be bringing the correct element to the fight I main DB and it breaks my heart to see so many DB users in G rank not even owning the correct element instead just using tigrex DBs.... For armor just look at them having completed armor skills and its fine defense is a nonissue for me unless youre using LR armor in Grank. Having  wystones is a plus too dont understand why players in G crown only have  i mean you only need to do like  quests to get the second oneLastly you need to remember that all players will make mistakes and cart. Doesnt matter if youre Gold crown or anything. Just dont be the one that double or triple cart.In the end Monster hunter is a casual game in which you can play with your friends and everything.

You also lose  dragon but you gain a little bit of purple sharpness   more attacks less sharpening and a  slot  which is why i use Le paladin right now.

In fact nowadays I mostly use my phone as a music player when I go out. And believe me music takes up a lot of space. And you also have to take into account the different culture people around the world has. Im not too sure about yours but for me my friends usually share their photos over group chats like whatsapp which can quickly drain my available space. I treasure my memories and I enjoy the thrills I get merely from looking at photos from the past. I do store them on my computer so I only keep the recent ones on my phone.

3606724,0,t3_31o9hi,Lance is a defensive weapon and by defensive I mean defense is the best offense weapon.  The lance is meant to take as little damage as possible while staying right up on the monster to do damage typically around the monsters torso and head.  Given your position be mindful of hammer and ImpactCB users if they hit you dont get too upset over it youre kinda in their space.  Edit Oh! and for your moves X is a forward stab best for hitting something a bit ahead of you as well as closing miniscule distances.  A is an upwards slanted stab it does more damage and doesnt reach as far forward instead going up a bit.  R is your guard lance has great guarding ability.  RA is your guard counter its a timed frame where your lance will charge up a bit and hit back immediately after a guard doing some nice damage its very notable due to its ease of use during AAA combos.  B is of course dodge lance gets hop dodges and only hop dodges which is amazing since theyre so much faster.  Evade will make your entire dodge an invincibility animation.  Holding Guard forward and X will do a guard advance which can be followed by a shield bash great for moving forward while still staying safe the shield bash is notable since it lets you imediately go out into your bread and butter combos. Last up XA charge.  Charging is valuable for closing great distance and in U it has the ability to be used as a mounting move.

I think the slots are better spent on Handicraft or Tenderizer.

After you fight him for a while youll kinda figure out a rhythm and instinctively dodge his attacks.When I fight him I will assume that he is going to turn and bite me after every move that he does. When I expect him to do that I dodge and he whiffs  of the time.Evasion  or  help a lot because all of his attacks are so quick that you can just keep attacking him and dodge a second or  after each attack.His breath attack leaves him very much open. You can usually get a few attacks off when he does it. If you have evasion then you can just roll through his breath if youre caught in front of him and get a couple of attacks in.If youre using hammer or LS I highly recommend using evasion. The hardest part will just be timing your dodges. Also with hammer I would suggest just attacking the feet unless theres a huge opening to hit the head. Its a lot easier to dodge everything when youre right under him.,MonsterHunter,cq7bwg7,1,t5_2rron

3668102,0,t3_3203es,I think there could be another big risk and reward ranged class and special enough that it becomes a unique enough weapon without diminishing other rangedmelee classes.Introducing Arc Grenadier who will have slowest walk sprinting speed with this weapon and unsheathed only allow you to move in a limited rangeexplain below. The basic mechanism of this weapon type is actually like a one man mortar unit.. you walksprint and trying to find opening by using this class you can throw your ammo like a grenade with different typeimpactblastelemental where you become the only class that can deal damage without unsheath your weapon.. But when not in deployed mode the bullet does only AoE wise damage. And does not benefit from the weapons multiplier.. When deploy there should be sort of animation like HBGs seige but slightly longer.Maybe in between the duration or HBG seige and deploy a trap. Where your weaponlooks like a mortar or big cross bow like the ballista hunter needs to adjust direction with in a limited range and have some indicator like bows arc shot. In this mode your ammo benefits weapons multiplier like all other ranged weapon but since you can only move with in limited range you are in greater danger when manipulating it. Basic ammo would include some traditional types but also specialized ones that deals direct statuselemental damage. After deploy ammo type determine the arc of trajectory and how fast you can shoot. Since this will obviously give more damage than HBG the balance to it would be how the reload is implemented Id say around  for max ammo. Like in traditional HBG where you dont get recoil but with slower ready speed for next shot.. With this weapon your ammo deal real stopping power it will take less ammos to stuninflict statusflinch but the trade off is this will be the only ranged weapon that requires maintenance just like gunlances it eats sharpness for shelling and could overheat. Youd need special gearcome with weapon that does the cleaning and reduce heat build up.. So this weapon cant be use for solo then? Nope you can solo but there is a trade off. In deployed mode you can only manipulate it with in certain range like ballista BUT this is also the only weapon class that you can leave your weapon. You regain normal walkingsprinting speed with a small boostlike walksprint faster than all other class when not carrying weapon and you still got ammos in your item pouch. Just like in unsheathed mode you can throw ammos without multiplier it also gives you enough mobility that you can choose to leave it in place so you dont have to deploy it again. But the trade off would be any damage that happens on itsay an fireballexplosionbeam attach would also eat its effective gauge just like when GS is doing a block. So when you get back you need to use your maintenance gear to make if back to working condition if it sustains heavy damage.. With the away mode you can also do something really unique. You can not adjust direction when you are away from it. BUT if you already have ammo loaded into it you can remote fire!!! Nope its not some tricky stuff just imagine that you are always attached to your weapon with a trigger wire. You cant leave zone without your weapon and by leaving manipulation range your own mobile range is also limited to the trigger wires. This would give this weapon a special function in both multiplayer and solo. It would change how you approach hunting and with a wide range of current skills that can be applied to this weapon type.Artillery bombadier reload speed element damage etc etc.Yep thats my idea of how another ranged weapon can be incorporated into MH series and are unique enough to stand on its own.,MonsterHunter,cqadzt2,1,t5_2rron

DPShot bows tend to go unnoticed since people just want faster and faster and faster times most of these Bows also have Charge  and may not have Power Shot making their DPSecond dipTo be honest I dont feel like wasting a lot of time to get into Critical Distance positioning with pierce. Its Crit distance is a bit far yes but I always remember that there is no way I can get all  hits in Critical Distance not even with Pierce . So I position myself to get  Pierce  hits in critical distance and the rest not in distance penalty which is basically just being too far. So instead I end up firing a Pierce still within Rapid Critical Distance range to maximize my damage. I could even be lazy and just fire it from far away since it has more distance and thus I have no need to close any distance...I do end up wasting a few hits beyond critical distance though...,MonsterHunter,cqahveu,2,t5_2rron

3669910,0,t3_32dkmn,The worst thing about the vertical stages I think is how some monsters just completely ignore it. Other than something like a Konchu or Renoplos I think the enemy charging at you should not just suddenly BE up the ledge you are on. Tigrex is okay most of the time because he DOES climb his way up but then you get things like a Gravios or really anything charging at you and just sliding up the wall with no effort as if it wasnt there. I think it would have been so much neater if you could have used ledges of a certain size to trick the monsters into tripping. If you moved up the ledge at the right time during a charge not just them running towards you and it would mess up the enemies if they couldnt halt their charge in time it would make things so much greater. A Zinogre should not be charging straight at me up a ledge that is about as tall as it is without SOME method of addressing this. ,MonsterHunter,cqalecw,1,t5_2rron

Unless other rideable monsters have much different moves to allow lots of playstyles sure. IE Theyre not all just the rathalosrig monsters like Kutku and stuff with the same moves and shiz.Even then for me to enjoy it I have to like the monster Im riding. Not just its playstyle. And if the ones I like dont play how I like itd be a severe kick to my personal interest.And then if that was true... Why ride at all? Might as well be Be the monster. instead. Like.

3684001,0,t3_32jija,I see a lot of people talking about how the guild drags the monsters body back but my own headcanon is actually that nobody does. I figure were forced to go back in just a minute but why? My first thought? Scavengers. The big bad monster is dead and now that its safe smaller but more numerable scavenger monsters come out to feast on the body. You leave not because its convenient but because its even more dangerous to face the potential horde.The only ingame support I have is the Gore and Shagaru. If I remember right they specifically say that the Shagaru came from the Gore you beat. Which means that body was left out in the wildnot taken in.Of course this theory seems less likely when you consider that we do get bonus materials at the end of the hunt so its implied somebody got more than  carves into the body and gave it to you. And Im sure I missed some canon talk somewhere of the guild taking in the bodies... so I dunno.,MonsterHunter,cqc78at,2,t5_2rron

3699749,0,t3_32ql51,Hi there there are two ways to get the effect extender with the perfect  Power  Stamina and  Speed kinsect.Method one is to level as you go which is the one gaijinhunter recommends. Since it does put in some more speed making the kinsect still effective while still upgrading.In short start with Power until it hits then Speed to and then Stamina to .Then this is where you choose LadytowerBilborix for the effect extender kinsect.You finish the kinsect by using Speed until  and Power until it hits .This will give you  Power  Stamina  Speed as mentioned before making it the perfect kinsect.Method  is for those who know they have all the materials to finish the IG in oneshot because it maximizes speed last making it kinda a pain to use when incomplete. The benefit of doing this way is you wont need any  nectars.In short start with Power until it hits then Speed to and then Stamina to .Then again you choose LadytowerBilborix for the effect extender kinsect.You finish the kinsect with Speed and youll get to .Again this will give you the  Power  Stamina  Speed final kinsect.Ladytower and Bilborix are both the effect extender kinsect. Ones for the cutting type and the other for blunt thats all. nectar can be gathered in grank expeditionsperfect is in quote because its debatable but were not here for that.P.S. I personally love the effect extender kinsect and would not go with any other type. The increased buff duration is amazing and the high speed makes it very easy to extract with. ,MonsterHunter,cqdzv69,1,t5_2rron

3709504,0,t1_cqevb1q,I main ig and its all about damage. If you can get rodeo god after damage its good but not worth going out of your way for. I would highly suggest sharpness  as your main goal. Challenger is amazing as well with mounting. Since you can topple an engaged monster and just wail on it. Make sure you always keep your triple buffs up or at the very least red and white.  Just as an example my set is pretty god like in g rank and the set is Honed Blade sharpness  and attack up large razor sharp challenger  latent power  and bombadier. Most of these skills are specific to my glaive blast element but you get the picture. For high rank you can go for a mixed sharpness  and razor sharp with steltas armor and a good talisman. That should be fine all the way to g rank. Special note that if you can only get sharpness  speed sharpener can be great if your weapon loses sharpness quickly. Try and aim for a glaive with a ton of white sharpness. Like the sect happa. Hope thus helps!,MonsterHunter,cqf3xqn,1,t5_2rron

3710340,0,t3_32w5pl,Bring flash bombs if you manage to flash a monster while its flying youll knock it out of the air giving you some free time to wail on it. Also memorize its tailspin attack it actually has an amazingly short range so its easy to get out of it just hits all around pinky so it seems hard to dodge. Another thing to be mindful of is when its positioning itself to tailwhip you while its flying you can super man out of that if you need. Lastly it doesnt hurt to remind players just because your knocked flat on the ground doesnt mean you have to get up right away try and stay on the ground until you think its safe to get up. To do this just dont press anything when youre knocked on the ground and unless youre stunned you should remain lying down. One thing to keep in mind is there is a limited amount of time you can remain lying on the ground.,MonsterHunter,cqf7d92,3,t5_2rron

Focus on the head while its down legs while shes up just take care with her tails spins.One more point of advice if you arent bringing dung bombs every mission bring em they will make most monsters leave the area when you hit em with the poop.,MonsterHunter,cqf8w2l,2,t5_2rron

3711974,0,t1_cqfcz6f,Ill second that garuga is an awesome part of a dual blade set as I use it in my all around elemental end game dual blade set that has razor sharp sharpness  crit eye  elemental critical and speed sharpener but jho and garuga hit like trucks especially for people who have just entered g in high rank swag. Garuga is particularly hard to read at least from my experience and having a gset already like tetsucabra at least allows a bit of leeway for some mistakes a new to g player is bound to make as they learn the ropes and boundaries the monsters allow.Your recommendation is great for end game Im working on getting my jho set together as well in fact but for a person just breaking into I see nothing wrong with recommending sergieos or other classically recommended early g sets. As you progress into g and beyond you can start specializing your set to your style more once you understand the jump that is high rank to g rank. General advice and set recommendations which players learn each have their flaws and will be better served with mixed sets in the long run are just that general and apply at least moderately well to most situations a newly g hunter will encounter. I know I personally armor sphered my HR Rath Heart armor up to Steve made his set and worked from there. These sets are also great because they provide some moderately helpful skills to a multitude of weapons. As a DBGS player mainly I really appreciated the flexibility of these sets across weapons. ,MonsterHunter,cqfe238,1,t5_2rron

3761910,0,t3_33i2f3,Well in one sense you should be able to get some awesome times with any weapon providing you are very good at using it have good equipmentskills and have good knowledge of the monster you are facing yes even hunting horn its perfect for zingore for instance.However after spending some time soloing with many weapons I think there are  that stand out when trying to solo something. Note that I am generalising here there are loads of weapons that are great to solo against specific monster Wide gunlance vs dahren moran SnS vs raths HBG vs most elder dragons but here are some tips you might find useful in general Greatsword  knowing where a monsters face will be in  seconds and landing a level  charge on it does an unreal ammount of damage. And when youre the only target monsters become very predictable. GS also has a great combo for downed monsters lvl   slap  strong lvl   roundhouse and is brilliant at gettting extra damage on sleeping monsters. If you know a monsters moveset to the letter then you will kill things very very fast Charge blade  if you can guard point every attack then your DPS will be insane. Ultra and super bursts are fantastic for KO and waking monsters. Especially good against monsters that like to charge a lot diablos tigrex Insect Glaive  I dont use this weapon but the jump attack is really really good as mounts are a little OP in this game. Essences give you attack boosts recovery and earplugs so if you know what you are doing then things will die pretty quickly Lance   Right so the lance actually has loads of really cool tricks. Again jump strike although admittedly not as OP as the IG version. evasion is broken as hell because the iframes overlap in the triple hop giving you like  seconds of invunerability. Countering is a bit like charge blade and great for keeping DPS. The lance charge  dash juice does unreal damage to certain monsters especially those weak to blast or element Dalamadur Najrala definitely othersLike I said if you are really good with a certain weapon then you can get great times regardless of what weapon it is. But to get the truly amazing times you might want to have a look at the ones I listed.,MonsterHunter,cql33n1,2,t5_2rron

3767747,0,t1_cqllxe6,No worries.For armor I believe its entirely up to your skills preferenceplaystyle but Sharpness is a must for blade master especially for this stagephase. The extra sharpness helps a lot that youll find yourself rarely sharpen until the monster moves to another map. I myself finds that Earplug  HGE is the best skill after Sharpness for LS.B.Tetsu is good defense wise for G but unfortunately LS does not benefit from the guard up. I couldnt remember what I was using when I hit G sorry. But before hitting G I was using Skull Visage Velociprey Mail S EX Rathian Braces EX Rathian Faulds Aelucanth Crura X with Hearing  sockets charm for Sharpness and Earplug. I can then either gem in HGE or AuSM depending on the monster and weapon sockets.,MonsterHunter,cqlr1p8,1,t5_2rron

3790315,0,t3_33tutp,I have  relics which Ive polishedupgraded and use in some sort of equipment set. My guild card says I have done  guild quests but a good chunk of those  Id guess were from when I didnt try to specifically grind level  guild quests for loot and was content with helping people level up their guild quests because I still felt like I needed the practice.None of mine are as good as they could be but theyre good enough to use. Stuff like a max raw greatsword which has no elementstatus or slots it has  avarice... and an ice lance which upgraded for defense but still has better rawelement than the kushala lance. Unfortunately I dont own a max rawelement weapon that has  edgemaster and the largest amount of purple sharpness possible but I do have a fire lance with  edgemaster... if only more things were weak to fire so I could use it more often.,MonsterHunter,cqobquv,3,t5_2rron
3791252,0,t3_33u3qw,I think relics were designed for the really hardcore players who want to minmax their gear. I agree its a tedious way to make players grind for the best gear but I find that doing  GQs made me very proficient at the monsters tied to them. For example Rajang which was one the most difficult monsters for me to handle is now a cakewalk even at lv  after  hunts. I think not focusing on getting good gear but trying to improve yourself by fighting lv  monsters is the best mindset and eventually youll land on some of those godly relics. Just my experience!,MonsterHunter,cqoflrj,20,t5_2rron
3792262,0,t1_cqoiy1n, How do monsters drop a specific part of their body? You might know this but in case you dont In the case of tails you actually have to run up to the tail and physically carve it. Then the drop rate you saw online will apply.The tail WILL NOT disappear so wait for the monster to switch areas then carve away. You can still just get unlucky and not get tails but breaking other parts has no effect on your carve chance. Breaks add completely independent rewards. Also is IG the best weapon in the game or what?Totally depends on you.Ive heard some say IG is really powerful in the beginning of the game due to the attack buff but generally agree all the weapons are equal after mid HR and it just depends on the player.It sounds like youre really comfortable using IG andor not comfortable using bow. Of course you can also ask for some tips to bow GM or just get more experience with it amp crit distance. Maybe the IG will always be your favorite weapon. Or maybe not. Also how does elemental damage work? Do certain elemental types do more damage to certain monsters? Is there any way to check that?Elemental is different from and independent of raw damage yes and yes. Each monster has different elemental resistances which you can look up on Kiranico or in Pings Dex. Like raw damage each parthitzone of the monster can have different weaknesses and the higher the number on the weakness chart is the more damage the element will do.If you dont want to look this up you can look at the elemental resistances on the monsters armor but this only helps once youve killed the mon once doesnt always work and wont list what the weakest parts are.Example Kirin isnt really weak to any element and takes  thunder damage. Meanwhile Silver rathaloss head and neck are very weak to water and by a smallish difference thunder but he takes no damage whatsoever from dragon.,MonsterHunter,cqojquo,1,t5_2rron

3802169,0,t3_33ypm5,Id honestly say dont bother with them. Went through the entirety of MHP maining Duals and through the entirety of the game I used maybe a dozen Dash Juices. Marathon Runner was a necessity then but with the way theyve rebalanced Archdemon mode you can get by just fine with no stamina skills and no dash juices.Stamina management is the name of the game. Your DPS between Demon Mode stamina draining and Archdemon mode is honestly a very small difference and given how quickly the gauge fills its very easy to maintain Archdemon mode on the majority of the monster cast. Dash Juice may have been a nearnecessity for optimal damage output in past games but between the buffs to Archdemon mode and the fact that Demon mode now burns Dash juices twice as quickly as normal its much simpler and very much viable to forgo them entirely. Most of why Im recommending it too is that itll make you much better at hunting with Duals in the long run too.,MonsterHunter,cqpoeac,8,t5_2rron

3841564,0,t3_34fdrr,Well you can say you are wasting your time not attacking but I would say thats subjective. To me the bow is a weapon that gives you the mobility to attack as much as possible. I think its okay to line up a shot now and then and youll want to always try to hit weak spots. You can probably hunt faster by being accurate regardless if you are aggressive or not. I say that because if you are aggressive and dont hit weak spotscrit distanceproper element if need be then you still arent really going to help your hunt. You can still play safe and hit the right spots and have decent hunt times. However if you are able to constantly attack the weak spotscritelement then youll really start bringing the hunt times down.I really think the bow is a good move like a butterfly sting like a bee type of weapon. You can charge up attacks and move while attacking basically you really have to exploit this to be good with the bow. Knowing exactly where to stand how to move and attack all at the same time will take some practice experience and probably a lot of headache.

3864893,0,t3_34pdds,Bring a Fire SnS against the White Khezu.Try to mount him as much as possible utilize the ledge jump that is unique to SnS remember you can do a quick mounting attack off walls when you roll towards them and press A with your weapon out and then press A again to jump off. It makes him much more manageable when he is lying on the ground.You can bring Pitfall traps to have some extra time wailing on him.Try to get Evasion and Guard Boost if possible. Guard Boost lets you block his elemental attacks that would otherwise hit you and Evasion allows you to use Stylish Bombing to get some extra damage in or roll through his attacks.Master the SnSs charged Backhop. If you see he charges up hop backwards and dont jump in again this move and how you utilize it is very important.Khezu can certainly be more annoying to fight than others because it feels so unfair if he hits you in a  degree but I would say he has more openings than others. His bite attacks the shooting lightning balls all leave him open to get some good hits in. Stay away if he charges up and always stay on his side. You can also use Dung Bombs to force him to leave an area if you dont like fighting him in the caves. He is really not that bad if you play defensively and Thunderblight is something I never bothered removing it because it doesnt increase the damage you take. Thunderblight only increases the chances of being stunned if you are hit repeatedly which you can easily break.,MonsterHunter,cqwtyqd,2,t5_2rron

3901119,0,t1_cr0tbnh,because its not a black and white thing. the Axe X gt Burst  is more DPS but like has been said before is dangerous to use because you cant GP out of it and youre immobile. if you watch these videos typically you see the Axe X gt Burst  used when the monster is immobilized.meanwhile the Shield Thrust to Super allows you to dodge out of the Thrust in case you need to abort and if you dont the Super has a high chance of staggering and gives you higher KO if you nail the head. the combo is strictly a math DPS boost and only should be used in perfect scenarios. i agree in the abstract with the parent poster here in that youd want to avoid using it unless youre sure you can pull it off and gaijinhunter in the video took a bit of a gamble. but it is undeniably more DPS and very easy to execute when you know you can get it off. ,MonsterHunter,cr0yn1w,1,t5_2rron

There are moves that are tricky to dodge with the lancethey cant be blocked wo guard up All gas releases and lasers are a pain. The laser being the worst because he sweeps around with it. The gas CAN BE dodged but you have to back stepbig backstepback on the analog stick as u press b and another backstep. If you dont do a big backstep or as ive done many many times turn around and back step into him you will get hit. Overall it was a worthwhile learning experience for me and gravios U has the best Hr lancing armor imo because of the ease of gemming in DuXL and natural Guard . If youre willing to try the lance I highly recommend Sharqbyte deals lots of water damage hes weak to water and it is an effing shark. Oh almost forgot to mention when youre safe to counter guard. Any of his rollscharges dont do it too soon though or you get hit anyway When he flaps his wings to do a body slam you cannot counter guard that just keep up ur shield up. Hes super easy to mount because of how slow he turns after his charges you can turn around and tap the special icon to begin charging analog forwardb to jump while charging and hit X to do a mounting attack.

Most of the karmagrabbing fluff is just people asking questions about potentially picking up a new weapon what skills what to craft... but whether or not they actually follow through and play online is a whole other thing to wonder.

I abandoned the first attempt after I couldnt enter without both of them spotting me I carted almost instantly when both of them ganked up on me so I quit immediately.Second attempt same gear same items I completed it with minor problems. I finished after min with  cart. My strategy was simple take out Seregios quickly I used WystoneDrive which was done after  min. Then it was Diablos time and by the time he went Apex my Drive stone was available again so I took care of him.He died after just min too now I had some downtime just enough to carve and sharpen combine etc. Just when I was done the Deviljho appeared I activated my Wystone Brace and went on to attack his legs. An unlucky combo killed me from  to  in a matter of seconds. I waited out the cooldown for my Wystones before moving in again. I was able to knock him out of Apex rather quickly and the rest of the fight was a piece of cake.Jho took me longer than Diablos and Seregios together which I could have probably prevented if I didnt insist on waiting for my Wystones.It was easier than I had thought after reading about all the people failing online. But then again I had fought those monsters before in Frenzy form and Apex shouldnt be all that different.

The first hit is the only hit that multiplies when u hit it if you hit it in the face while setting off the bombs youll only multiply the weapon damage rather than the bomb damage .so its a good idea to kick the bombs so u dont hit the monster .weapon damage gets a x multiply while bombs get a x,MonsterHunter,crks47l,0,t5_2rron

It will change ACB from being  better to being  better.gtand Im not assuming every build will use Dragon Atk theres a ton of different permutations of what skills could be used DA Attack up WERuth etc. Tons. Im sure theres different results in lots of cases.And lets not even begin to talk about Lv Charging.Im showing you but one of the hundreds of permutations of scenarios that simply proves that its completely subjective to say that one bow is The best. Im not saying ACB is the best either. Thats my point. Even Kama can have comparable damage to VDesirACB on shagaru with as little as AuMWE    Kama           .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Your math is also very sloppy for one you forgot the level  charge mult . not . which would actually work in your favor and for two youre completely ignoring spreads biggest disadvantage accuracy while focusing on its biggest advantage  multiplier. Youre simulating a spread hit that has all  arrows contacting Shagarus head in critical distance. Even if that shot is technically possible I would hazard to say its not its not something that anyone would be able to do consistently.  A more likely shot is  arrows hitting the head and the other  hitting wing libs front arms maybe neck etc. Those shots are possible and they reduce the damage thats being done by a ton.I could go and calculate it all but Im not going to  hint I already did  because its pointless because I think at this point youre just fullon reddit persona mode and have almost forgotten why youre even arguing. Every comment you make to bolster your point your just you setting up strawmen and knocking them down in order to try to prove me wrong on a point that Im not even making.Theres hundreds of thousands of different permutations of skills bows amp monsters and thousands of different player skill levels to make use of them. Claiming that one is better than the other because you find it effective or because you watched a speed run video on once it is presenting your opinion as fact and that is misinformation which pollutes the sub.I corrected the misinformation you were giving showed you where you went wrong and gave some objective information instead. Im not arguing about the merits of one bow or another with you I drew comparisons simply to show you that your claim of one bow being the best is subjective not to prove that  one bow is better than another. I use VDesir I use LInnocence I use Kama I use ACB I use Dragon Relics I use Lightbreak theyre all viable and have situations in which they shine. Im saying that you need to do proper research before spreading facts as advice and avoid touting your opinion as such or if you do at least preface it with in my opinion so other readers know it.

Cons hard to get used to LBG for elemental damage or status.Pros Mobile exploiting elemental damage makes it easier to break some parts almost every gun worth making has some kind of status shot on it.Cons Exploiting elemental damage means having to learn where monsters are weak to it requires at least  guns and charmsdecorations for ltElementgt Atk  for each of them. Bow for mobility and raw damage.Pros Very mobile only need to make one Steve and one set of armor to go with it.Cons Extremely placement and item reliant power coating is a must to keep up damage is a charge weapon so stamina is critical.,MonsterHunter,crp859t,6,t5_2rron

Keep in mind it has  fate no skills boosting sharpness free element has use only on weapons with a hidden element crit element needs more points to be unlocked and isnt that good at all its bad Fencing also needs more points to activate and is also kind of bad because you shouldnt hit spots you bounce off of anyway since you deal less damage to those. Destroyer is... okay I guess. Ceadeus has it too though. Attack up S is... tiny. Youd have to build it up to L or XL to really have it be worth anything.Ranger set is only beneficial for guns really. I think reload speed just speeds up applying coatings for bows which... really... thats like a split second anyway?The recoil also has no effect for bows and not every gun needs it.It might have a little bit of use on a LBG element set maybe? But it would likely be outclassed severely by a different full set or even more so by a mixed set.The positive side of both sets would be that they have  slots and two of them are  slot parts. So for the blademaster one you could get handicraft by chucking two gems into the  slot parts and a  handicraft talisman. But even then that just makes it so the only good part of the set is that you gemmed in sharpness.So I guess ideally you could get attack up L or M using the extra slots as well as some points from your talisman if it was like  Attack and  Handicraft with or without some slots.But if you dont have anything better it could be a good set to tide you over defensively while you get another set.,MonsterHunter,crpfzow,3,t5_2rron

There comes a point where Capcom will have to sit down and say you know what we gotta stop introducing new weapons.

Adrenaline is a very high risk high reward skill to have as you get a huge damage boost but will be fighting a hit away from death. It also comes with Awaken naturally so its nice if your weapon has an element requiring awaken.The downsides are that youre going to have to use one slot to gem out Demonic Blessing and that you wont have enough slots to gem in Handicraft without a really good talisman Handicraft OO or Handicraft OOO minimum.. Critical Eye is also not that useful. All in all this makes it a decent but not endgame armor set.

You can grind Dalamadur to HR sure but that still means you know his moves and clearly if you made it to dalamdur youve already caught all the monsters in the game.

4227940,0,t3_39bxru,Its a simple fact that charging to Lv does more damage per charge than charging to Lv while charging to Lv does more damage per shot than level .This means purely from a DPS point of view Lv charges are not worth the time you invest.Beyond that the extra time spent charging often means that youre missing some openings and could even make it harder to stay alive.Generally speaking you really should be sticking to the shot that the bow has on Lv. Now about youre specific example anything that has a high raw hitzone that takes  shot and up generally means that raw will be your biggest factor in damage by a huge margin so you should just stick with a raw rapid bow Kama instead of trying to build the element set.Elemental bowing has its place but youll have better results on Cephadrome with rawrapid.,MonsterHunter,cs25ujg,1,t5_2rron

4328053,0,t1_csd2fy6,Pasted from another reply I gave to someone aboveI can certainly give you some tips!Stay near gore magala! I assume youre a blade master. If possible gem in evasion  it helps a lot of youre still learning him. Ill try my best to describe his moved and what you should do but I aint no english major sooo... Save your mounts when he has his feelers out! You want to minimize the time his in this state. The first mount takes two hits of mounting damage to pull off. When his on the ground target his feelers! Break both of them! He has a few moves where he spits the dark fireball thing. One is when he spams three of them in front of him another is when he shoots only one. Then he has the one where he spits one that explodes in a chain of explosion. Lastly he has the one where his right claw rears back and when he swiped forward theres a chain of explosion. How do you avoid this? Simply roll towards his body! When youre under him you take absolutely no damage!  His most dangerous move is when he rears back and falls flat on you. Its an instant kill for me. What you should do is try not to roll away from him since IMO his hit box in front of him is big. I am usually able to evade through this but if you cant either guard with your weapon or roll towards one side. I try to roll diagonally towards him if I cant make it out reason Is I find sometimes his knees hit you and you dont take full damage! But if whenever possible try to roll away.  He has two moves that involve his claws. One where he hits with his left claw then right claw and possibly chain into the fall on you move. The trick is to roll to the opposite direction! When he pulls his left claw back roll to the right twice. Or once if youre out of his range. Same for the other side! Another one is when he just uses his right claw to smash the ground in front and back. When he pull his right  claw back roll to the left a few times. This two moves has HUGE wind up times and a decent recovery time for you to wail on him. When his in the air he has  moves. One is hell shoot the dark bomb straight. Another is when he does this counter clockwise bombing in front of him. Lastly is when he rears back and flies forward. Stay behind him! Go under his body and move to his tail part. When he flies he usually goes up and forward so itll miss you! I use the insect glaive so when im under him I can use the XX combo and still hit him.Thats its! Most of the moves he does here. I recommend the insect glaive against him or chargeblade. If youre still new dont be afraid to use the chargeblade to guard! Lastly try to take it SLOW. You have  minutes and his no HP sponge. Take hits when you wont get hit! Heck I killed the LR Gore with the first version of the Nescrylla insect glaive in  mins but you dont have to do that! A successful  min hunt is a successful hunt!Good luck Hunter! ,MonsterHunter,csdi1ki,1,t5_2rron

4330160,0,t3_3alhve,Yo. I havent played MH in a while and currently dont have any resources on me to comment on your gear but Ill share what I did to kill this monster. For offence I recommend a pierce bow due to its large body size. Im not too sure if an elemental bow is better but I used the pierce bow with water elemental dmg the Dahren Mohren one.  Dont forget to ai at its weak part! The chest for elemental damageFor defence I feel that its a must to eat for fire resistance especially if youre fire resistance is in the negatives. Thatll help you survive for quite a while longer. Good luck with your battle with black Gravios!,MonsterHunter,csdql5m,2,t5_2rron

4347396,0,t1_csflzfm,gt Why does it list .x for elemental bursts in the first source while the second lists x. That is a very good question. It looks like the Ultra Burst does x instead of the .x for the regular burst. At least according to Gaijin Hunter.That being said GaijinHunter says the ultra bursts do as much as the super bursts which makes a lt phial ultra a waste of time and resources. I am not sure which one to believe.I would tend to believe the second link though as if we look at the google translated wikis they agree on everything except the phial and burst damage. the first does not have the formula for the elemental bursts while the second one does.First WikiSecond WikigtWhats this .x modifier thats never mentioned in the first source but is in the second?I am not sure.

4372865,0,t3_3b32kh,A highspeed kinsect helps you pick out the color you want from the monster. If  you use the pheromone marking and your kinsect hits the wrong spot you can command it to attack again and itll whirl back around and try for another shot at the marked spot. This also helps when you dont actually mark the monster and are just shooting your kinsect straight forward.Typical Blademaster skills work well for IG. Mounting could be nice if you want it but you really shouldnt be trying to spam mounts unless youre soloing. In a group it can be kind of annoying to have someone mount the monster repeatedly because everyone else has to back off while they play the minigame. Two or three times thats fine because that gives everyone a chance to sharpen up and get ready to unload their heaviest hitting attacks when the monster is downed. Six or seven times?

The most common way to dish out dmg is to charge the shield and continuously use the shield thrust it procs the element dmg twice. An easy way to infinite combo this is simply xgtxagtxgtxa...

4481787,0,t1_csvi5ek,ARMOR SETSIf you want both HGE and EvadeEx and a good hearing talisman you can use the NaKuNaKuNa template or if you have a good evadeex talisman you can use the SeGaSeGaRa template. NaKuNaKuNa  Narga Helm X Kushala Chest X Narga Arms X Kushala Waist X Narga Greaves XSkills  in evasion  in handicraft  in evade extender.  innate slots to work with. Itll require a good hearing talisman but in general those arent very rare to get so a few Sovereign of the Sky charm runs and youll have it.SeGaSeGaRa template Selene  Helios Helm X depends on if youre a girl or guy Garuga Mail X Seltas Arms X Garuga Waist X Rath Soul Greaves ZSkills HG Earplugs Razor Sharp  points in expert  in handicraft.I personally used SeGaSeGaRa until I got my god charm Evade Au ooo since I had a handicraft  talisman. Unless you already have a handicraft talisman it could take a few hours to find one depending on how lucky you are but again. Its doable.Keep in mind both of these sets require G parts. If you want to stick with Regios X youre gonna be hamstrung by very hard to find talismans and potentially a slotted weapon as well.SKILLSFor SwAx Evade Extender is an absolute must. Your entire goal is to sit on a monsters face for as long as you can and EvadeEx and perhaps even some Evade skills are absolutely crucial to allowing you to do this. A lot of people frown upon Evasion but I find  and  just so helpful when SwAxing things like Rajang where if you get hit once youre done. Also in my logic it doesnt breed any bad habits if its all you use! D The standard S and Razor Sharp are both really nice too as again it lets you sit on their face. Something nice and underappreciated about SwAx is that in sword mode the double chop only counts as one hit in terms of sharpness not . So abusing that can seriously net you some sharpness advantages. I personally didnt insert Challenger into my set but from personal experience the DPS i gained from being able to sit in melee range constantly of an enraged monster was more beneficial than theoretical damage output where I constantly had to be safe from an enraged Rajang hitting me. It also helps that I managed to slot in AuXL anyways. P HGE are nice but not mandatory. For monsters with long roars like Black Gravios they can net you a ton of free hits or something that roars really obnoxiously like Rathalos can save you some health. But if you love HGE by all means use em! Skills are meant to help you out so tailor them to your playstyle!WEAPONSPersonally I absolutely LOVE the Chameleos SwAx Waxglare Wand. It looks awesome it has great raw power phial  slots a TON of purple sharpness with S and a hefty  poison. Another good alternative to a nonrelic endgame SwAx is the Ceadeed Axe. It has more raw than the Waxglare but no slots and less purple sharpness which makes it more hamstrung in terms of its skills. But in terms of raw power Ceadeed is unmatched. If youre still in G and want to dick around there for awhile by all means do so! The Seregios SwAx is really fun to play around with thanks to the fact that you almost never have to sharpen youre normal fighting pattern weaves in a ton of evades anyways in order to keep yourself in position to fight a wriggling monster and its also nice and powerful to boot. Another popular G favorite is the T. Zamtrios SwAx. Its also nice and powerful and in group hunts the paralysis can really help. If you play aggressively you can usually get off  paras a hunt. A slightly more defensive approach and youll get  in.  CONCLUSIONAll in all SwAx is probably one of the most underrated DPS weapons in the game. A lot of people clamor about HBG CB and Greatsword but none of those three except in perfect play a CB can match the raw aggressiveness of SwAx. You have the complete option to just sit on a monster throughout a complete hunt aerial or on the ground because of the fact that in axe mode your swing hits high enough to reach a gold crown Deviljhos tail and in Sword mode your swings are quick enough to allow you to quickly sidestep out of a monster turning to hit you. In general sitting on the side of a monster is your best bet. While the theoretical DPS of something like HBG and GS is higher very rarely outside of HAME runs do you get that level of perfection. The amount of error correction you can do with SwAx is absolutely ungodly and I really hope you enjoy the weapon as much as I have!,MonsterHunter,csvlgr6,3,t5_2rron
4482550,0,t1_csvltkl,I agree that Trajectory is a crutch for Normal S.  Even though you can get multiple hits with Normal  only the first one benefits from critical range.Trajectory is pretty useful for Pierce shots as you can get more of the hits within critical range.  Just getting an additional one or two hits with the  damage modifier adds up.  With very large or long monsters you can get all  Pierce  hits to strike within critical range  AW YISS!Its fairly easy to solo Quagmire Quarrel with a good Pierce HBG and Trajectory without having to resort to Adrenaline  or Heroics provided you use the Dragonator well and resupply with the  Pierce  shots in the blue box  in the starting supplies  with the subquest completion supplies.GRank Dahren Mohran is super easy to solo in  minutes with a Pierce HBG and Trajectory.  Youll likely have to bring some combines for additional Pierce ammo in addition to using the  Pierce  in the blue box.  If you have Silver Bullet or eat for Felyne Sharpshooter Normal  is a good backup if youre incredibly cheap and dont want to use up materials.,MonsterHunter,csvowqg,1,t5_2rron

Either way I usually just pop a might pill for the  raw bonus and move to where the bombs are and charge a lv attack almost as if the bombs werent there. As soon as your charge goes off so do the bombs.

4697526,0,t3_3f9ah1,Im shocked  absolutely shocked  that no one has made an Ace reference yet. XDYour skill set is pretty spot on already. I didnt used to be a fan of Evasion I always went with something more aggressive like Weakness Exploit or Stamina Thief but since Hunting Horn is a weapon you ideally shouldnt be sheathing too often evasion is key to playing an aggressive Hunting Horn.Bottom line is there are just some monster attacks that you cant roll through without the aid of Evasion. So take that into consideration when you face certain monsters. If its something very agile consider keeping Evasion. If its slow then maybe try the damage boosters.Also how did you hone your hunting horns?I gave the Steve Horn defense honing just to see how itd fare versus Life honing and so far its been going well. While ideally you shouldnt be getting hit a lot its often unavoidable when you do encores and the monster goes apesht crazy and runs after you. The added defense and the bonus Divine Protection sometimes outperforms any HP recovery that I would have gotten from Life honing.,MonsterHunter,ctmnv34,2,t5_2rron

4713670,0,t1_ctoot3l,Hehehe thats right. I wish you the best of luck with soloing Dalamadur. He has an enormous health pool but the fight itself isnt too difficult once you get the hang of it. Basically the biggest thing for apex monsters is the fearintimidation factor. You have to be careful but at the same time remember that if youre not being aggressive enough you wont bust them. Then if you dont you have to wait the full  minutes before you can hit them properly without bouncing and have the chance to try busting them again. Ahh I get what you mean now. If you want a challenge for yourself Id recommend playing in whats called Hard Core mode. You basically go into your game options and turn your HUD off so you cant see your stamina or health bar etc. XD makes shit really tough and nerveracking.

Largely because over the time Ive spent with the weapon it feels so much easier to land spirit combos in U thanks to the runin spirit slash.Also Im really not sure that the red maintenance is much of an issue.  In four player teams hunts are so short that the extra time in red without having to land another roundslash it takes forever to finish that animation often results in the monster dying before you even get a chance for it to run out.  In longer hunts elder dragons for example the maintenance really hurts but with effective teams it really doesnt feel that bad.And unlike U I havent had any issues with bad luck or performance making me run out of yellow.Or maybe it could just be that the constant fade slashing of U LS is super fun and I want to defend my choice to keep playing the weapon.

Funny story about that beam actually. I was duoing Act of Gog a while ago for my friends last hunt for HR. He was using charge blade which he had never used prior to that hunt.Gog went into second phase and after a short while reared up onto its back legs to beam so I vaulted towards it.

Each monster will take different amounts of damage depending on where you hit them and with what kind of damage output. The main damage attributes are cutting impact and shot and bow is heavily influenced by multiplied damage. Depending on the type of bow you have to be a certain distance from the monster to have a multiplier applied that maximizes damage output. This is critical range.

4894908,0,t3_31rvtf,A few notes a lot of things I want to mention so cant follow format.  also pretty streamofthought. wide range even as support not particularly great for SnS. at most its instant antidotenulberry since you can just use lifepowders. in fact might as well put this and speed eating under nice to have some would even argue for not recommended.  and since SnS hits very often but can use items speed sharpen might be a nice option. Another SnS and DS addition should be element attack .  Element up is honestly a pretty tiny boost when compared to that and would be nice to have on both. Oh and when demon mode and losing the rolldodge evade extender doesnt actually work so I cannot recommend it. Longsword seems mildly cluttered but incomplete.  things like tremor resist kinda just depend on the monster instead of being generally nice to have and crit draw is just a very odd choice these days.  maybe add focus at nice to have.  at the end however I have to admit it is a weapon with lots of choices but few absolutely necessary ones. Greatsword could have weakness exploit slapped on nice to have and if you are going to add quick sheath under sheath control might as well also have punish draw. Hammer is another oddly cluttered one but more so.  attack up might as well be in the general skills since its a straight upgrade and crit eye is unfortunately a very minuscule bonus comparatively unless you already steroidboosted your raw.  and you also repeated yourself with challenger.  weakness exploit however is something I would absolutely move up to recommended considering you do best when hitting the head anyways. maybe maybe add evasion x to nice to have since being near the face is troublesome sometimes. hunting horn might as well have maestro up in recommended.  its easy to gem in it doubles the time before expiration and people that tell you they dont need it are wasting their time and combos with unnecessary replaying of songs. also confused by taunt since that seems like overkill when you aggro with music but hey impact weapon so it works. Lance is another weapon you can add weakness exploit however it fits better in nice to have since you cant always get to said soft spot with it.  I would also switch guard boost with evasion since guard lancing doesnt always need it and evade lancing is just as legitimate a play style. in fact also add evade extender to nice to have so as to mirror guard boost.  I recently also switched out elemental skills not really helping with razor sharp  steady hand and would eve suggest razor sharp as recommended since you attack pretty fast. thought of this after typing it all fits here razor sharp can actually also be replaced with speed sharpen I suppose depending on the weapon sheath speed you add one to recommended and the other to nice to have.  steady hand is its own beast so it can stay wherever it fits. Gunlance is fine.  I cant even argue that guard boost in not recommended it is pretty slow.  maybe evade extender to nice to have.  Oh and load up  minds eye down there too. Switchaxe definitely needs razor sharp in recommended sword mode and the stamina combo put in a lot of hits. might as well add evasion X as nice to have since it has such amazing dodge windows.  and since you made a comment on stamina skill for DS I would say note element attack X for element phial. Charge blade should be specified as artillery novice the higher tiers are obviously better but the gains are negligible. would also add element attack X to recommended since that is how much element phial deserves it.  maybe load up to nice to have. insect glaive is strangely lacking. to be honest rodeo god is unnecessary outside of elder dragon cheesing so definetly not under recommended. element attack X and status attack X should definitely on nice to have too the weapon hits so many times that its a shame you see that in so few sets.  and since other similar weapons have it evasion X fits there too. light bowgun does not need recoil literally the only setting for it is using Gods Archipelago for hame runs or something even more obscure since it doesnt affect rapid fire. load up and bonus shot and clandestine are both good skills to recommend however. reload speed is also nice. honestly just to remind people it exists heavy bowgun could have a note next to recoil saying how its for everything but normal shots they frankly dont need it. reload speed is another nice addition. bow should also have shot up recommended period. also load up should be in nice to have with a note saying necessary for seregios and akantor bows. only other change however might be to say marathon runner  stam recovery if no mega dash.  oh just noticed that in DS it says marathon runner if you do have mega dash juice... finally the general skills in the gunner section need to be split up a little. they should be skills that benefit all classes but the three guns are frankly very different from each other so it doesnt quite work out.  raw boosting helps everything but ruthlessness and weakness exploit only help with raw damage so I cant really recommend them for LBG outside of seregios.  similarly load up is just a general benefit for both guns but only for specific bows.  and finally might as well go ahead and retype challenger as challenger X gt fleet feet gt peak performance since they override each other but are always appreciated with gunner.I meant everything I said here but that doesnt mean its all correct.  Just speaking from experience and previous discussion,MonsterHunter,cubjjgj,1,t5_2rron

I think people have already done math research on the elemental CBs and found the amount of damage there quite insane.Also I use a Dala CB with my Focus Load Up set because it has high raw three slots and a defense boost. You dont need affinity or sharpness with Artillery Novice and a firm desire to dunk some monsters. Actually completely offtopic but I wish you could do a AEDs from a jump attack.

4994414,0,t3_3jc65k,My advice would be stop worrying the drops or failure and just play the game. Monster Hunter is an action game where you fight monster so just enjoy the fight.A useful tips. If you need to fight certain monsters for armorweapons dont push yourself too much and just fight the needed monster couple time before fighting another monster which you also need their part. Rotating between different monster will avoid burning out and boredom of fighting the same thing again and again.  You also can do it with the game itself. Play Monster Hunter then Pokemon then Prof. Layton spend one hour for each game daily. Youll progress slower but still progressing rather than become stagnant.I myself cant play Monster Hunter continuously for hours I get burnt out really quickly so I play for three hours then watch movieanimeyoutubemusicmangaother game for couple hours before I play Monster Hunter again for one hours.So far it is working and I still enjoy playing Monster Hunter very much.,MonsterHunter,cuo0h3r,3,t5_2rron
4994473,0,t3_3jc65k,The advice I would give to stop worrying about the next drop or failure? Just stop worrying about it.

If you want to just take your time and enjoy the lower ranks for a while you can totally do that. What drop is next? Doesnt matter youll get your drops over time. What if you fail? Doesnt matter you can try again now armed with the experience and knowledge that came from that failure.Play based on what interests you at the time. What piece of armor or weapon caught your eye? What monster do you feel like fighting for fun? Just do whatever you feel like doing and little by little youre making progress. Also try playing online sometimes if youre able to.,MonsterHunter,cuo0qbg,2,t5_2rron

5054821,0,t1_cuva1do,For blademaster weapons the listed attack value is a lie.  Weapons dont actually do damage based on that they do damage based on a hidden value.  All weapons share the same basic range for these hidden values getting up to around  or so for endgame weapons.  The game multiplies this hidden value by a number specific for each weapon class to generate the actual displayed raw number.  We call this hidden value true raw.However just because a SnS and a GS might have the same true raw does not mean that they do the same damage per hit.  Weapons also have specific multipliers attached to their attacks which determine how much of their true raw gets applied in any given attack.  GS does waaaaaaay more damage in a single hit than SnS does due to it having some very large mulipliers on its charge attacks.  These multipliers are called motion values and they are usually listed as percents.But wait theres more!  See every monster part also has a damage multiplier attached to it.  Monsters take more damage in some parts than in others which is why you kill monsters faster when you spend a lot of time hitting them in the head.  These multipliers are called hitzones and theyre percentages that are usually listed without the percent sign e.g.  which means . or .There are also some other multipliers for sharpness and affinity and weaponspecific multipliers.  You should Google around for the actual damage calculation formula if youre interested in reading further into this.,MonsterHunter,cuvapve,2,t5_2rron

The phial increases your blast status by  so you can reach that blast threshold in fewer procs. The elemental discharge has so many hits I think six mini hits and then the explosion that having an increased amount of blast means youll reach that threshold faster and once you do youll be making progress towards the next explosion. In general the elememental discharge is really good for abnormal status axes since it considers the whole move one swing meaning the blast or status will proc on all I the hits like the double swipe in sword mode or a dual blade demon dance. In fact depending on how high your status or blast value is those six mini hits in a row are arguably more valuable that the explosion at the end,MonsterHunter,cuxoh5v,1,t5_2rron

One of the biggest frustrations with soloing it is that you are pretty well locked into needing optimal sets at least if you want kill times of under a half hour. Its all well and fine to have fun being the Wide Range  SnS with tons of pots and seeds but in solo you need to have damage and lots of it.That being said it absolutely can be done solo and natural skill will get you through most of the game. DS MHU made that a mandatory experience along with frustrations like frequently failing Hallowed Jhen and most of the super DLC monsters dont think for a second youre gonna have an easy time with Clashing Beats. He hits way too damned hard and you dont get the luxury of having him attack anyone else but it was an experience that I relish having been through. Enough so to have my second character in  be a solo hunter.From what Ive seen of your preferences elsewhere in the comments I can also safely tell you that you shouldnt have a problem with Dire Miralis using DB.

Considering jumping is no longer just about mounting being able to propel yourself forward instead of just upward actually looks great.  Plus the double hit with no red buff and the added height with no white buff.  So a more extract independent build?The skills however i dont see giving enough feedback.  The DPS thunderbug thing entirely depends on how utterly offensive you can be and how far you can squeeze into a monsters crotch and I guess the instant triple buff gives glaives a much needed break from constant upkeep if they choose nonmeta kinsects.Bushido style?

5145114,0,t1_cv65yd7,In MHU a lot of Bows had lowish raw but skyhigh element. Thats why.Even so against monsters that do not have heavy elemental weaknesses... For instance nearly every Bow speed run in U was done using the Brachydios Bow due to high raw Spread Up and Slime. However things like the Dire Miralis Bow had such high element that they destroyed monsters like Lagiacrus.TLDR its a saying that became popular during Us hayday.

5186592,0,t3_3aswln,If you get Artileery God skill even with max RAW and purple sharpness you can use your stabs against weakpoints and charged shells against anywhere on monsters the loadup skill is worth mentioning for Wide shot GL. Even with the penalty to the full burst the extra shell amps up your full burst to be nearly on par with the load up normal as you gain bonus  damage. Not that you should focus on full bursting but after your attacks on weakpoints with your epic Rawsharpness its nice to have the truedamage nuke at the end that deals around  less damage than your standard  hit combo with max rawpurple to enemy armor of  or greater. once armor is above  is the shells outdamage your combo even with purple max raw. I apologise for the long winded explanation but Load up is really good for GL artillery god sets in my opinion. If you had skills to increase your combos damage then maybe load up wouldnt be worth but also having the extra shell is good depending on how often you use the chargforwardshell attack.

IE Rathalos EX Ukanloss high rank set and a good number of others.No field pouch. Or item sets.ChaCha and Kayamba and their awesome mask system are there.Gigginox is in it and thus that alone makes it the best game ever.The maps arent quite so confusing. Such as that one room in U where jumping off the left or the right side... both lead to the same area... for some reason...Beware Qurupeco.Hammers are actually good because everything else hasnt been buffed with it being left in the dust in addition to the fact that CB is absent.No wandering Elder dragons. Chameleos Teostra and so on.Spread bows are better than they are in U due to the terrain being flatter.Move differences on lots of weapons.Final boss Gog equivalent is a mix of Fatalis and Dalamadur.

Wings are easier to reach than with most weapons because the vertical nature of the swings with GS and access to upswing in niche openings allow for fantastic damage.Great Sword is probably the best breaking weapon.

I find that many people misinterpret template sets as these sets are good when in reality they are sets you could make but you will almost always have better options by the time you can make it most of the time.Off the top of my head Stygian Zinogres armor set in HR is often paired with the Seregios Bow.

5716447,0,t1_cx5o0dr,Ive tried all the combinations.X slash gt XA shield thrust gt XA phial burst? No longer works. XXX threehit sword combo gt XA shield thrust gt XA phial burst? No longer works.Every time you press XA after doing a shield thrust the game automatically unloads the phials you charged up into your shield.One other thing I just noticed the nature of Guard Points has completely changed. A successful Guard Point in MHU meant that you returned to your neutral state after the very slight pushback that comes from doing a Guard Point on an attack from which you can roll away side step phial burst or transform into axe mode.A successful Guard Point in MHX now means that you continue doing whatever animation you were before doing the Guard Point. For example doing a Guard Point successfully doesnt stop you from transforming your sword into an axe. I dont like this change. It means I have way fewer options after getting a Guard Point. Also even if Japan riots over the changes to the Charge Blade I doubt that anything can be done since the full game is coming out in less than  days. They will not be changing anything in terms of weapon balancing. ,MonsterHunter,cx5oj8e,5,t5_2rron

5760455,0,t1_cxb0ode,Both impact and elemental have shockwaves that are separate from the weapon impact in u but the elemental shockwave is particularly delayed. From what Im understanding in MHX you need to actually connect with the ultra burst with the axe head itself to do any damage at all. There is no explosive splash damage from the ultra burst that can damage the monster even if you miss with the axe and will be like super burst instead where you need to smack the monster with the axe in order to get the phial bursts. If this is the case I like the change since with impact CB sometimes it was better to wiff the ultra burst axe hit in order to make sure the shockwave didnt travel past the head hitzone and not apply the KO. Same with ele head hitzones and elemental charge blade.,MonsterHunter,cxb4zlr,3,t5_2rron

Dont forget Power Phial is a  raw boost while Element Phial is a  element boost. You can easily calculate this stuff on your own. Axe mode actually benefits from elemental damage a lot so thats another score for the Fatalis Force.Anyway Im noting a distinct absence of the Baraq Sedition being mentioned here. In my experience its probably the best allaround Switch Axe. It doesnt need Sharpness  anymore and while it does need Razor Sharp I sure hope you werent going to use Switch Axe without Razor Sharp.Youre left with the second highest raw out of Power Phial Switch Axes but unlike the Ceadeed you actually keep purple for longer meaning that in practice youll likely be doing much more damage with the Baraq Sedition.Also its totally trivial to keep your sharpness up. As a Switch Axe user youll be rolling around enough to have purple at all times. I only really see my sharpness drop if I am bouncing.Honestly theres almost no reason to use anything other than the Baraq Sedition. Everything else is just a novelty.

Ive been currently switching between Rathalos Zinogre and Tigrex Armor sets and have been using their respective Great Swords. General tips for High Rank Quests? I tried my first one solo which was to hunt two Jaggi and I can definitely feel the difficulty increase. Since they throw you into any random area is it recommend to find camp straight away to pick up supplies? Since Ive hit High Rank in both GH and Caravan is it pointless to make Low Rank Armor? I pretty much have been forging armor due to how cool they look  ,MonsterHunter,cy0gsa7,1,t5_2rron
5957282,0,t1_cy02ci7,Just as an example Gaijin Hunters Regios LBG set is pretty up there and has Trajectory. It even has AuL as long as you maintain top health. Regios LBG alone is already very strong with no need for reload speed thus making shooting much faster and more often. Regios LBG is also relies on evasion in order to reload so you already have to know where to dodge. Trajectory is a skill that allows you to be safe from the monster and as long as you have some sort of damage boost you dont really have to worry about not doing enough damage you get to shoot from an even safer distance and still stay at critical distance. I didnt say to reduce offense to have Trajectory I said to add it in if you can. Trajectory isnt a skill that hinders the player and I didnt treat anyone like theyre a terrible player. It doesnt get in the way of improving with the gun and not only is it there just for survivability. You can shoot stuff further away so you can still shoot the monster even if it is far from you. It is a defensive skill that gives that sort of relentless attack from afar and Regios LBG isnt a gun you should really stress about damage since it already does a bunch of damage. Having maximized attack boosts is for people who just want to have a maximum damage output. Youll fine without maximum attack stacking but defensive skills are nice to have.TlDr? I understand the whole offense is the best defense but the saying can go both ways. Attack is great but an extra spot for a defensive skill is also great. ,MonsterHunter,cy0j3xk,1,t5_2rron

6024630,0,t1_cy7b70d,Elemental is way better than Impact. Impact can be better multipurposed similar to Rapid Normal LBGs in which multimonster hunts wont have the same weaknesses. Artillery God does not work with CB which is maxed out at expert or novicefelyne bombardier so that skill isnt really necessary. Gravios for example can take some time to kill with Impact but Water Element Phial can just wreck Gravios. Impact since it can be repurposed is good when you dont have a good element phial and can stun monsters pretty fast no exhaust though. Elemental Phial CBs requires armor skills to be at maximum damage ElementX Load Up etc while you can just take Impact Phial with many different sets but Element will outdamage Impact either way. The only time when Impact is better than Element is when the monster does not have big weaknesses Kirin is pretty resistant in that it has no large weaknesses or if you dont care about Elemental hurtboxes Impact is set damage while Elemental depends on the zone it hits. ,MonsterHunter,cy9cnei,2,t5_2rron

Though eventually you will end up crafting several more and upgrading them. Armor works in a similar way in that you will likely end up making multiple sets. However as a general rule I see alot of suggestions of Tetsucabra set as a good go too set.

Its true for Blademaster weapons as well its just that with BM weapons you have more leeway for mistakes.Drink for Moxie.

Now with the shield charged and phials charged you can use the axe mode and press XA to do the ultra burst instantly. The super burst you use by tapping X while pulling the circle pad backwards to your character during the ultra burst animation its a bit tricky but after you get it it gets easier.

6220513,0,t3_40r6xb,A weapon that is thrown and benefits from gunner skills.Shurikens. Large ones though so if youre familiar with games that have chakrams as a mid range weapon more like those. You throw them and perform combos. And either they return like a boomerang or attach them to some sort of rope or chain. Basically you have a weak melee like the bow but your real power comes from throwing the weapon and allowing you to perform combos. They get coatings just like bows do and each swing consumes a charge of coating. So  individual swings will use up power coatings etc. They should have some sort of charge attack and the charge attack will vary by each weapon like the arc shot for bows.For example one type of chakram get a powerful charge up attack almost like the GS allowing them to unleash a well timed and stronger attack on weak points.An additional charge attack for a different type would generate several hits making it real good for status or elemental damage. Allow these charges to only consume  bow coating per charge letting you maximize your status coatings.,MonsterHunter,cywpe46,1,t5_2rron

6322395,0,t3_427oy4,Its a surprisingly complex minigame. To answer all your questions It has two colors because it has two different attacks. All monsters at the end of a route will have  so you have to choose your own attacks wisely. Green dots mean it has so much power in that color that they cant make the square any bigger or itll take up too much of the screen. Your own palicoes will also get these dots if you use enough of the same color in one turn. Each attack choice is assigned with a button input its usually directions on the Dpad but if you have all  palicoes attacking then one of them uses the Y button. Palicoes sometimes slack off and wont use their abilities for some turns. This can be reduced by having a palico with the Skill Technician ability. Their enthusiasm level represented by the cat face next to their name it goes down after huntingusing the casting machine but goes back up if you do quests while they arent doing anything will also affect their performance noticeably. Nope! However I find that they usually use the left color for at least the first  turns. You can always quit without saving to get another try at it though if you use the same palicoesattack choices then the outcome will always be the same. Slacking palicoes mentioned above.There was a guide on how to win more easily but I forgot where it was. The general strategy though is to recruit some palicoes with the Unreal Blocking ability up to  though less can work and then add a Skill Technician palico and at least  attacker. It helps a lot though its best to wait until later in the game when the wild palicoes start being recruited at higher levels around  so theyll be more effective. I dont know exactly when that is though.,MonsterHunter,cz8aca2,2,t5_2rron

6469205,0,t1_czog99r,Didnt know that about the nd sword attack likely because i rarely use the base combo when you can x xa or a. Oddly Ive never had an issue with rx and have no idea how people do. Like i cant mess it up even when trying. Maybe because i use a cpp?Gunlance in X does look cool and shelling is more important especially with the hunter art that doubles shell damage. No idea how its balance is relative to other weapons though. I still think its best to use shells to extend combos or do something like poke shell poke or shell poke so then you can still evade quickly. From what ive seen of solo runs people do shell more than they did in u but thats also because its a high rank only game and shells are strong relative to monster hp.Gunlance motion values are low relative to the speed of its hits. its solo kill times are also on the slower side and its optimal dps is towards the bottom. Its a very fun weapon about the only thing ive been using for the past few hundred hunts but in u its certainly low in damage output compared to most other options. In u you can also stack so many offensive skills that shelling falls off end game compared to pokes this certainly doesnt help its design.,MonsterHunter,czogmq1,0,t5_2rron

6544007,0,t3_458he1,I think you nailed it with the world building and like to add that as a game Monster Hunter is greater than the sum of its parts. The weaponsarmor reflect the monsters killed to make them which highlights the relationship between the hunters and the world their in. Mechanically the combat shows the weight of the weapons the monster tells and animations are used to signal the player how to react and give them personality and depth.    Clearly this is a team that has the programmers artists and game designers in the same room when designing major set pieces like the monsters weapons maps etc. The game elements work better when they dont have to stand independently on their own and thats what games that try to copy the format always miss.    At the end of the day though I think Capcom was fortunate enough to find a team thats talented passionate about their work and cares about their fans. Ive never felt let down by a monster hunter release and when you play the games its clear the developers love it just as much as we do and to me thats what makes it really easy to evangelize these games and get excited whenever major news drops.,MonsterHunter,czw7c3p,3,t5_2rron

6999657,0,t3_4bfj2u,I want a weird pseudo projectile weapon that would be a cross between the hunting horn and an insect glaive.Basically youd be given a tube looking thing like a super stylized antitank launcher depending on the monster you got it from. Similar design philosophy to a HBG but itd have a massive projectile barrel instead of a little rifle barrel. Initially itd have nearly the same exact moveset as the hunting horn like how each swing is a note and it exclusively deals KO damage but during recital mode youd swing it around in a combo and load roundscharges into it with each move. Then when you had a combination loaded instead of playing a song you could mount the bazooka onto your shoulder. Once it was loaded after the loading combo you wouldnt be able to put your weapon away or dodge except for a lance hop backward so you would have to aim like it was a kinsect and then you would fire a huge projectile that explodes and blows up kind of like an Ultra Burst. Maybe you could even do an encore combo and fire off a second projectile really quickly as well.You could have a couple different shot types depending on the combo like KO damage exhaust or just extra rawelemental damage. The devs are more creative than I am and I bet they could come up with something even cooler but thats my vision. I think itd be amazing to play with.,MonsterHunter,d19r6tk,1,t5_2rron

7017611,0,t3_4brp3s,There is indeed no GRank!If you think thats a bad thing worry not!    Its actually great!For one MHX has only  less large monsters than MHU had.   Which means the same number of cool monsters to fight!Also MHX  has more nonDLC quests than MHU By a little bit  So you can expect there to be just as much to do in MHX as there was in MHU.What makes it better however is that due to the lower overall attack of weapons the variety in builds is better than ever!   Lower levels of attack up will have a greater effect on your attacks and there are new armor skills that make weapons with low sharpness levels deal significantly more damage bringing them onpar with white sharpness weapons!The only potential bad thing is if they come out with a MHXU or somesuch which has a bunch of new content but also requires us to pay for the old content weve already played.

7024075,0,t1_d1c84oy,MHU didnt run at fps when you were hunting anyway it could run at  but could it fuck manage it anywhere it actually mattered. It dropped even more if you had the D on which considering they didnt add the option to turn it off like they did in MHU it meant if you did turn it off via the slider you had to have the fucking blurry shit visuals luckily that option is back in MHG.Locking it at  lets them build it around the framerate it managed in the first place instead of building it around running faster than it actually did it also helps reduce resources used with D on which are likely being used by the newer visuals as you asked. Very few DS games run at  and the ones that do are because the devs specifically set out to get it running at  theyre the exception though and they put in ridiculous amounts of optimisation to get it running. MH isnt exactly known for its optimisation.The amount of fetch quests suck but they dont have anything amazingly good locked behind them you can skip over many of them unless youre going for completion and just do the few important ones. None are key quests past  star village for example.,MonsterHunter,d1cj4lf,1,t5_2rron

Health sets your max health at  or  it becomes trivial once you unlock better food at the canteen but keep in mind that when you faint during a quest your max health bonus from eating will be lost. So if you have health you can faint during quests with no penalty. The other option is to craft an item called max potion but they arent that easy to farm for at low rank. Medicine is always good as it makes your healing items stronger. ,MonsterHunter,d1j9soq,0,t5_2rron

Is the timing supposed to be that tricky or is hammer a weapon where you need to always predict ahead to use? Also on that note are the level  uppercuts supposed to be your bread and butter?

7194516,0,t1_d1vy22t,a while back i tiered things based on both average kill times and number of times abovebelow average for specific hunts. pretty much noted everything in my post. We are a little limited in info and can only use the more popular hunts so it is a little iffy. there are also dps calculations which dont indicate much on their own but do help explain why ig does so well compared to ls or sa.I dont think we can confidently make weapon tiers off speed alone. Unfortunately its harder to quantify safetysuccess rate. You can see by how players pick skill that they choose damage over safety. Guard lancinggunlance is arguably easier to play than the evade variants of both but its also generally slower in kill times.this makes making weapon tiers for general use a lot more difficult. I see GSIG can get kills twice as fast as gunlance but what are my chances of success with each? Even on a given weapon should we me mimicking speed run sets?

7595824,0,t1_d35k8yp,This isnt like some other games where its as simple as get X weapon or use X skill and it becomes easy. You have to actually learn to use the weapons and learn the monsters moves and how to react to them. Upgrading your weapon to a point where it has green sharpness will help a lot though as will making a full set of armor. Jaggi armor is a good starter set it reduces the time it takes to sharpen your weapon and makes you less likely to be dizzied. Here are some general tips Each piece of armor gives points towards certain skills. When your total across all equipped gear reaches  points for a skill it activates until then it does nothing. So  points of Attack doesnt affect your damage at all but  points activates Attack Up Small. Some skills have additional tiers at  and  points some have negative versions at  points. Decorations like Attack Jewel fit into slots on weapons armor and charms and add more points. Charms are an equipment slot that add points and slots but no defense or resistance points. Start with the caravan quests they ease you in teach you stuff and unlock a lot of things. Element resistances arent that big of a deal defense has a bigger effect on damage. Try all of the weapon types see which ones you like. Sharpness affects damage and how likely you are to bounce keep it high. Weapons that attack faster work best with element weapons that attack slower work best with high raw. NEVER SELL EARTH CRYSTALS. You will need hundreds. Other materials are fine to sell but try to keep a good amount of them for crafting things. I usually sell down to  of a monster material and  of an ore. Kiranico is a fantastic resource. Read the NPC dialog. A lot of people skip through it and end up stuck or think plot stuff is a glitch. Dont be impatient read the dialog know what to do and enjoy it.  When you hit a monster with a melee weapon youll see some blood come out. The larger the blood splash the more damage that part takes. If you bounce you lose twice as much sharpness parts that bounce take less raw damage so avoid them. If you find yourself getting hit by a monster a lot try just staying back and watching its attacks. Look for openings to attack in and when to dodge an attack.,MonsterHunter,d35luvx,1,t5_2rron

7678479,0,t3_4khmnl,You are correct it is indeed a HR quest and the drop is HR. It is a rare drop sometimes they take a while. Nyctgems come from body carves tail carves head breaks white scar on head in nonfrenzy mode and shiny drops. You do not get it from captures so make sure you arent doing that.Here is a sort of tip for future farming. Many rare drops are gotten from carves. If you think you can handle a hunt without good skills make a set with Carving God. This skill will allow you to get a guaranteed  extra carve  for  extra on everything. Yes even small monsters. The easiest way to do this is to do the event quest Fan Club TwoToned Titans HR  which will get you Fan Club Certificates. Use  of these along with the other necessary materials to craft a Hunters Camo SuitJacket. It is a torso armor with  carving. Then get another armor piece with torso up for example any Tetsucabra leg armor. This will double any skillpoints on your torso armor Sort of it actually mimics the amount of skillpoints on your torso. You can not quadruple the skill points with two Torso Up armors it will instead act as if you had x Torso. You will now have  points in carving and have Carving God.Edit Add in whatever other armor you want.

I decided to give this franchise another try because its so amazingly popular in Japan.I started using the Insect Glaive.. got familiar with the controls. After slaying my first Great Jaggi I was kinda enjoying myself.. I guess? Afterwards I tried Tetsucabra.. easy enough. Definitely more fun than the MHU demo.. I could slowly see myself getting comfortable with the game and its controls.Then I started the Gore Magala quest.. and thats when Ive fallen in love with this game or rather the entire franchise. After finally slaying it after a few tries.. I had to do it again and again. After a few hours of playing the demo I knew I was gonna buy it alongside MM D.I also bought the New DS XL MMedition for MHU. I mean.. MM D came with it but I couldve bought that seperately. I bought the New DS XL for the Cstick.. didnt like playing with the circle pad pro too much.Ive put over hours into MHU. Met and played with lots of people from this subreddits IRC channel.

7981611,0,t1_d4d3yje,Just to touch on your last comment. Guild is the original move set and there would be outrage if they removed it. Also it allows for  hunting arts which makes it a better choice than aerial or adept on certain weapons. Switch axe is a good example. One art decreases your sword charge at a steady rate but provides a large damage boost. While another art refills your charge to max. These two can be maintained indefinitely without much effort. The reason SA is better with guild than striker is because striker loses some powerful combos and there isnt a clear choice for a third hunting art anyway.New styles are nice but they do not replace guild. Theres always a trade off.,MonsterHunter,d4d7ice,0,t5_2rron

I rely on Archdemon mode to slide through the monster. I believe the combo is xa in x x a dash out. I like to have a full meter when I start that. Youll hit his legs and be on the other side of him by the end.It may not be the right way of doing DBs but thats the joys of MH! Everyone plays a little different.

7996312,0,t1_d4eup3e,gt well i do use a explosion gun .Sounds expensive. Thats the primary reason most people dont bother  it costs so many combines to finish a hunt that its not economical to use regularly.gt evade extender i just find useful point blankAnd thats fine but when you declare this a very good gunner set you imply certain things one of which a very low costeffectiveness ratio i.e. extreme effectiveness per unit cost. EE on an LBG is nice but the same problems it overcomes can be resolved by positioning yourself better or taking Evasion  instead which is generally easier to mix in. On a Bow its completely unnecessary. gt and divine blessing so you dont get  shot most of the timeshots rarely happen as long as youve sphered your armor up to  minimum for late Grank stuff and youve already invested  slots and several armor pieces into not getting hit. You could be taking a damage skill like Pierce Up instead to make the hunt shorter and therefore risk fewer possible hits. Gitting gud would also mitigate any issues you have with taking damage and I think its entirely appropriate here since youre already taking so much evasion and still feel the need to invest into defense.,MonsterHunter,d4ev0yz,2,t5_2rron

8001089,0,t1_d4f3eiz,Well thats not the only reason. MHU was my first Monster Hunter game. On my first save I was rocking unupgraded Jaggi armor and a Bone Lance and I got rekt by the Gore Magala. When I figured out more about makingupgrading equipment I had no money because I bought about  Book of Combos . So I just restarted. After that I restarted a ton of times because I wanted by Guild Card to be perfect so sometimes I wanted to main one weapon sometimes I wanted to main multiple sometimes I wasted money and sometimes I wanted to use a Female character. So I probably have over  hours in Monster Hunter  Ultimate. In my most recent profile I wont restart no matter what because I have to beat at least High Rank and Low Rank before MHGen Its unlikely Ill beat GRank by then but Ill just delete MHU off of my DS and create a save data backup so I can play after I beat MHGen.,MonsterHunter,d4fecow,1,t5_2rron

8179353,0,t3_4rco2i,. I personally keep it recalled until my buff starts to wear off as shown by blinking. In which case Ill snag one of the essences preferably the trickiest to obtain and just keep it on the bug. The moment they wear off Ill recall the bug then collect the other two essences. Note One of the biggest mistakes I see early glaive users do is stop to try and aim for essences. Get in a habit of just RX or RXA from sheath and shooting it strait forward while youre on the move. Much quicker once you get in the habit.. Just takes some practice. Just like any other attack look for openings in the monsters pattern. When you see narga recoil before a lunge attack just side step him and get ready. You know where hes going to go from there.. Incredibly easy to cut tails with the glaive. The red buffed attacks have the speed of dual blades with much higher reach. The only weapon Ive had more success with when it comes to tail cutting is the greatsword but thats pretty obvious. However keep in mind they seem to have buffed the resistance to part breaking and cutting in the demo. It took my team of blademasters almost exclusively cutting at his tail around  minutes to get it off in the demo even after traps and Paralyze knives. Normally this would have been done on the first trap with people focusing like that. Good luck.,MonsterHunter,d4zyvbs,2,t5_2rron

If you look at MHGen Speedrun Times they are both more in line with the other weapons because they have been rebalanced. As for GS it is that high because there are people out there that have mastered the weapon which is incredibly tough and most people dont have the will or wish to master it. GS is a very skillheavy weapon so a bad player is worse with a GS than with most other weapons but at the same time a good player is better with GS than with most other weapons.

Its mostly for quick repositioning like if you are too close to the monster and wanna back up a little or if you need a different angle.

Second landing a final spirit attack in the red now resets you to full red rather than just adding a short delay. Red gauge attack bonus has been reduced to compensate  gt  but so far it feels a lot smoother now.More indirectly Adept and Aerial style have made it even easier to get and maintain red spirit with quick final spirit attacks. ,MonsterHunter,d5ci8hx,1,t5_2rron

And you cant just keep whaling on Seregios either because attacking ALSO made it worse....,MonsterHunter,d5l30vt,2,t5_2rron

8349990,0,t3_4txdlc,The bow doesnt start off very powerful but late game its one of the strongest weapons mostly thanks to the Teo bow. The armor skill focus and having a full supply of power coatings does wonders for the bows damage output but before you have access to that its a little lack luster. Also make sure your fully charging your shots and standing at critical distance when using the bow. This means you cant be too close or too far away from a monster for your shots to deal optimal damage youll see a significant amount of screen shake when your hits land if your standing at critical distance which deal almost  more damage. Critical distance applies to all gun types and work best at different ranges depending on the ammo and weapon type used. Guns also have an easier time hitting weak points then melee weapons so if your going to matchsurpass their damage output the games design expects you to be more precise and know where your targets weak points are.  The SnS is one of the most beginner friendly weapon IMO especially in MHG where it works well with every style so you can feel free to experiment and get relatively similar results. Due to its limited range and low spike DPS it can struggle against some monsters but its an easy weapon to be consistent with especially when soloing. In MHG the SnS received some substantial buffs and their are some good end game sets that play very well to the SnSs strengths and give it an obscene amount of versatility anything from support to elemental damage to raw damage output.    All of the weapons are relatively easy to use from a mechanical standpoint the important thing is to feel comfortable with a weapon and know its timing optimal strike distance and counter opportunities so pick whatever appeals to you most and stick with it. Its easy to learn new weapons once you know the basics and its much easier to practice when your comfortable with fighting a specific monster and can focus less on what its doing and more on what your doing.,MonsterHunter,d5lavp7,1,t5_2rron

8361420,0,t3_4u49dh,I personally believe starting with MHU would be better. Not only is it cheaper just in case you dont like it for whatever reason it also has a story you can follow and feels like your character has purpose. It also gives monsters proper introductions so you can have a feeling for their personalities and find your favourite. The single player where you will probably start is just more fleshed out and polished. Plus that game also has online multiplayer.IMO MHGen is more of a game built for monster hunter fans to have nostalgia trips on which believe me works. It doesnt feel like a game a person with no history of monster hunter will fully enjoy since many of the characters youll meet you wont know with nearly all being characters from previous titles. MHU also does not have the multiple fighting styles which many may say is a bad thing but I think it would better help new players learn the standard fighting styles guild without relying on hunter arts. Of course MHGen will have the larger community since many people would have moved over from MHU but MHU should still have plenty of people to play with.,MonsterHunter,d5mq9ot,3,t5_2rron

8361952,0,t3_4u296y,I think Aerial style as a whole is a bit poorly executed. If youre in Aerial style you can constantly jump attack the monster and the traditional MH gameplay of looking for an opening and taking it is completely out the window. If you arent unless youre an IG user or the monster happens to play nice with being near ledges the entire mounting system goes out the window. I think a better solution is to give the vault jump to all styles or at least just guild but with a limit on how often you can do it. Aerial would lower this cooldown a lot but still require you to be grounded some of the time.,MonsterHunter,d5msnrf,3,t5_2rron

Your having issues because you can barely hit it in the first place. If your not too adamant on staying with your Lance switching weapons just so you can take it down  would be an option.

8456701,0,t3_4vhfzo,Figured Id just turn my previous comment into its own postI think Guild Quests couldve been done better but I liked the Ancient Scroll system and I loved the way that U did Elder Dragons and to a lesser extent the Battlequarters fights. They made Elder Dragons like the Fatalis trio Chameleos Kushala etc seem like the huge deal they were in their respective quests. The presentation was solid and very hypeinducing imo.In Gens Elder Dragons just feel like strong monsters not the epitome of natural disasters they were portrayed to be in the earlier titles  especially when compared to the sheer strength of a level  elder dragon. You have to fight for your life against those and that made it feel all the more genuine.And as much as I hated the randomized reward system of GQs the simple fact is that fashion hunting was all the better because I could at least somewhat control for what armor pieces gave the skills I wanted allowing me to come up with some nice stuff. The R armor system is a step in the right direction but it removes the frustration and the aesthetic freedom simultaneously.,MonsterHunter,d5ymf2h,1,t5_2rron

Hit and run works very well with HH. Use the incredible movement speed from the whitewhite combo to your advantage the most important melody as well as the infinite stamina from many of the best horns. The draw attack is powerful and concentrating on these initial attacks youre unlikely to miss or expose yourself. I like to rush in and out at the head of the monster to get a KO.

8517137,0,t1_d655qz0,How Glavenus breedA female Glavenus in heat will constantly sharpen her blade and a male in heat will become a Hellblade Glavenus until musth is over.When a female in heat and a Hellblade Glavenus meet the female will bend over for the male as she is desperate to mate. The male will then mount the female and insert his penis into the females vagina and thrust savagely until he ejaculates. He will then dismount and the two will touch tails indicating they are now bound together for life as Glavenus mate for life. In a few days the male will revert to a normal Glavenus after he ejaculates.During pregnancy females care very little about their tails so they fly under the radar from hunters to avoid combat. The male will protect the female until she gives birth.Females are usually pregnant for around ten months. The female will care for the juvenile in their nest and the male will hunt for them. The female will constantly breastfeed the child and gently sharpen the juveniles tail until it sharpen its tail by itself.Once they are ready the juvenile will leave its parents. Whether or not they are in heat the parents will now have sex again to have another child. This cycle repeats for the rest of their lives.How Astalos breedAstalos in heat will constantly charge their body parts and will search relentlessly for a partner.Once two Astalos of the opposite sex meet they will waste no time. Astalos have even been sighted having sex while flying.The male will immediately tackle the female and insert his penis into her vagina and stand idle for a few moments. Astalos semen will explode out of the females vagina up to a radius of one hundred yards. Male Astalos empty only about one tenth of their sperm supply while doing this. The sperm sinks into the ground and acts as fertilize. Astalos mate for life.After about a month the female will lay up to ten eggs which will take a year to hatch. During this time the female spends all of her time protecting her eggs and the male will hunt for the two.Once the eggs hatch the hatchlings will start a family by themselves and the parents will fly away to reproduce again. If the hatchlings stick together long enough they will even have sex with each other to reproduce.Male Astalos can use their reproductive systems from the second they are born but females must wait until they are fully grown to use theirs. This results in male hatchlings raping many of their female siblings and wasting their supply of semen.How Mizutsune breedA male Mizutsune in heat will roar constantly throughout the Misty Peaks and the Primal Forest for a female in heat. When they find one the two will create a veil of bubbles to act as a privacy curtain while they have sex. Due to this nobody knows how the male transfers sperm. Mizutsune mate for life.After about a year after the male ejaculates the female gives birth to a child. The parents teach the juvenile how to hunt for fish. As a final test the parents teach the juvenile how to reproduce. Whether the mother of the father teaches the child is determined by the childs gender. This teaching session does result in a pregnant Mizutsune.If the child becomes pregnant then the parents will care for it during its pregnancy and they care for the child themselves.If the child is the one to transfer sperm then the child leaves and lives its life.How Gammoth reproduceA male Gammoth in heat does no more than search for a female impregnate her and search for more females to impregnate. Only males go into heat so females never search for males.Once the male finds a female he charges at her and knocks her onto the ground. Male Gammoth are unique since their penises are located in their trunks. The male wraps his trunk around the females trunk and ejaculates up to three gallons of sperm. The sperm flows down the females trunk and travels through a duct which leads to her uterus. After the male ejaculates he walks off to find another female to impregnate. Males remain within musth for up to a month.About six months later the female gives birth to a child and leaves it to learn by itself. Juveniles are a huge target of Tigrex and Blangongas.,MonsterHunter,d667a46,1,t5_2rron

8542202,0,t1_d698ohe,You could already do all of the funky dodging stuff with Adept by using the Evasion skill. The only real difference here compared to other games is that a large set of armour skills are harder to fit into a single set. In U and other previous titles it wasnt hard to fit Evasion onto near any set if you really wanted it. Now thats been pushed towards a single hunting style with more of an emphasis towards aggressive play.,MonsterHunter,d69ceqi,1,t5_2rron

8544578,0,t1_d695nf8,Amusingly Ive noticed that Striker occasionally lets you play like the good old daysEg GS striker removes the power charge after the slap DB striker removes arch demon and makes you focus on devil dancing GL striker removes the slam and quick reload bow striker removes the power shot all of which are pretty much the play styles of MHFU,MonsterHunter,d69n58d,1,t5_2rron
8545211,0,t1_d69pk1t,Because if you invuln frame through an attack what the game calls perfect dodging while using the adept style you get locked into a sprint animation for about . seconds then another . seconds for you to swing your weapon around.  You can only pick the initial direction to run in and cant change it once youve started sprinting.  You can only cancel the sprint via attacking which only allows one combo.  Whereas invuln framing through an attack while using guild or striker style is exactly the same as just regularly rolling.  You can stand up and instantly go into whatever combo you want without moving or just rol again in the case of enemies who have fast follow up attacks like a zinogre tail slam or glavenus tail slam.  Point im making here is if you can invuln frame through attacks without adept style or if you put evasion on your armor youve already surpassed the benefit of adept style without any of the disadvantages.  The style only slows you down unless you really need help dodging more then you need to deal more damage.  If they had made the sprint following a perfect dodge cancelableallow you to roll out of it or if they had given it two weapon art slots instead of  Id consider it balanced but as  it is its easily the weakest style only really a valid choice in the very early game if you like evasion but dont have enough armor choices unlocked yet to build an evasion set.  ,MonsterHunter,d69q080,-2,t5_2rron

8548857,0,t3_4wva99,Your translation is correct and it is the general use end game set this time around. Its typically hayabusa feather vaik S waist silver sol for arms legs and chest. A   slot sharpness or i think tenderizer charm will let you have it with any weapon you can have a worse charm with a slotted weapon. You need one of the above charms with  into crit eye as a nd skill if you want ce.its used for many but not all monsters as it depends on weakness exploit for most of its damage increase. Something like silverwind narga doesnt have any weak spots for it to trigger on.Its around a  boost with ce a bit over  for ce and makes use of the abundance of good natural white weapons such as hellblades. Even for thing that benefit from sharpness its hard to match the boost from this set provided you can constantly hit weak spots. One downside for the casual hunter especially since you cant max silver sol yet is its low defense due to using some parts that max out fairly low. Im stuck at  defense with armor charm and talon with it even maxed ill be well under . ,MonsterHunter,d6a6gg8,2,t5_2rron

8664627,0,t1_d6op3fg,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,MonsterHunter,d6op3hj,1,t5_2rron

8665720,0,t1_d6lbc2j,You are correct that neither sharpness nor affinity affect phial damage and for maximizing PHIAL damage specifically high raw is gt everything else. That being said it is not worth it vs a good portion of monsters in mhgx at least to use a set focused strictly on maximizing phial damage but neglects the TOTAL damage from normal attacks  phials. A set built in this fashion will have incredibly high phial damage but loses out on the sharpness modifier that permanent white weapons by permanent white I mean the tigrex or hellblade cbs with razor sharp and the absolute readiness hunter art equipped which is close to permanent white get to enjoy even if their raw is lower. When you do the math in mhgx the white sharpness weapons normally average lower kill times hence why the analysis of japanese speedrun records shown here  details that they are the sets used most frequently.,MonsterHunter,d6ou16b,1,t5_2rron

8667498,0,t3_4ymvxb,As a Hunter I main Sword and Shield and personally I use Striker Style.All three hunter arts are fantastic and the weapon like most fast weapons is great for status and elements! Paralysis is what I usually use with Deathprize and I consistently get three paralysis procs minimum per hunt.They can use items with their weapon out and oils can enhance multiple things! Affinity gives a  boost to crit chance Destroyer breaks parts and staggers easier Exhaust deal Stamina Damage and can KO Minds Eye gives Fencing prevents weapon bouncingAffinity is stupid good with crit builds which what Im using right now with Crit Boost gives  damage increase instead of .Destroyer is nice in general since it makes the monster flinch more and if you need certain parts this will help you get them.Exhaust on this is amazing because it lets a cutting weapon KO and if its used in the right hands it can make a hunter into a monster!Minds Eye isnt that great in my opinion but Ive used it a few times for monsters who have tough armor close to weak points.The shield in kind of bad but is useful for last second blocks roars and wind pressure. Chip damage is better than full! Dodging is great since you can evade after most attacks letting you keep the pressure even as the monster tries to retaliate.

8793796,0,t1_d74ve34, according to Gaijinhunter However the second attack in the A gt A gt A combo in Axe mode deals two explosions if both swings hit while only using one Phial.  The third attack deals  but changes you back into Sword mode and it cant be comboed into as quickly. So realistically youd be using the second A attack gt X gt A to deal max DPS and two explosions per A press or X gt A gt A to get the most use out of your Phials.  With that in mind you could get more than  damage out of  Phials.  As far as I understand from that video the Superburst just deals  explosions and the Ultraburst does  Phials     explosions so I dont think you can get anywhere near  damage from just explosions in one swing.,MonsterHunter,d74w8n8,1,t5_2rron

8804447,0,t1_d764s23,Here is the bottom line rule of thumbAll you need to be an effective cat with the standard build is the boomerang stuff.  Pierce Boomerang and Big Boomerang moves and the boomerang pro skill  And probably emergency retreat to get yourself out of trouble and selfheal.If you have both Pierce Boomerang and Big Boomerang running youre doing  boomerang damage. yes you read that rightNothing else comes remotely close.  Sure attack up critical up etc are nice.  But those give like like  total damage  increases once you factor everything in.  Those are drops in the bucket compared to the boomerang buffs.  Also earplugs will in most cases give you more damage than anything else you can buy for  dots just from the free attacks you get while the monster is yelling.Your cat is fine.My only suggestion would be about weapons  The Le Catphrodite is a solid weapon but it loses a lot of usefulness against things that arent weak vs. dragon.  And the Naja weapons .... I really want to like them but the paralasys number is just SO LOW....If you want a damage upgrade either try matching your weapons elemental type to the enemy i. e. keep a good weapon of every elemental type and swap based on what youre fighting or find a good general purpose weapon that works on everything.  One of the big strengths of cats is that they get a lot of miliage out of element damage on their weapons and status effects.  Poison sleep paralysis etc.In my opinion the best generalpurpose weapons are the Hellblade weapon Ashen Whiskers  great damage blast element although you have to fight hellblades to make it and they can be hard.   the Deadeye Garuga fan  Also amazing damage white sharpness and a ton of poison.  Nearly everything gets hurt by poison.   the Nargacuga weapon.  No element just a lot of damage and affinity.Also shameless plug if you havent seen it here is a decent list of useful Prowler info  there are a lot of weird edge cases about playing prowlers and its hard to find them all written down in one place.Again.  In conclusion your cat looks great and the people in the room you joined didnt know what they were talking about.Happy hunting!,MonsterHunter,d766bj4,3,t5_2rron

8866981,0,t3_51otan,Now you may be known and disliked by people but as you are new to me i will be the first to actually answer your question.People like GRank because GRank armors have more flexability and you can combine them with High Rank armors as they max out at the same values.Its like having twice as much customization as you do in High Rank.There are different moves in GRank some people like these more than the GRank moves.Granks have more health and have effectively harder parts making more things bounce more often making Sharpness Fencing or Git Gud? while in HR there is a point you can upgrade your sharpness to prevent bouncing so its Sharpness  or Git Gud? additionally the higher HP makes an indirect nerf to fixeddamage weapons so hunts with last longer or because some people feel fixed damage is cheap because you can literally aim anywhere and let loose.,MonsterHunter,d7doqfh,3,t5_2rron

Assuming  Raw Power CharmTalon and Felyne AuL  youll have  at White. Assuming  Raw Bludgeoner Power CharmTalon and Felyne AuL  youll have  at Green. Striker Lance charge thrust  MV with HellBlade Granat will do  actual damage omitting affinity for now and  Blast while Spiked Javelin will do  actual damage both calculated using a basic Weakzone of .People are overestimating bludgeoning weapons. It deserves recognition for allowing Green Sharpness weapons to be viable only some are  but it does not live up to the overwhelmingly positive praise. Akantor requires S or S to become viable does not exactly need Bludgeoner but thats one more skill either Bludgeoner or S needed to gem in in order to match White sharpness sets. If you can fit it with a god charm then Green can be right under the effectiveness of White Sharpness with the Crit Stacking Meta of Gen good luck trying to stack Crits along with Bludgeoner or S.EDIT White is a x. while Green is a x. multiplier. You need  Green to match  White. Easy enough? Well then now you need  Green to match  White easily achieved through AuL. ,MonsterHunter,d7dx82q,2,t5_2rron

8915117,0,t3_52dnfp,Ive played quite a bit of multiplayer striker lance and there are only a few things you need to be conscious of.  Obviously you should take care when charging  motion is nothing to sneeze at but its not worth it if you run over even one team mate to get the attack off. Use the charge incredibly sparingly and if you havent already start getting used to using the backward bhopgtbhopgtbig bhop combo to quickly cover distances.Standard attacks are fine unless its a small or short monster your A pokes arent likely to hit or trip anyone due to how high they hit. X pokes can trip but its usually easy to avoid hitting other hunters just by standing some place else on the monster which you should be doing with any weapon.BIG LANCE TIP!  So be careful. One thing you should know about the Lance that I didnt realize or even think of until I got online is that your hitboxes are extremely long. Stand a bit back from the monster or make sure there isnt another hunter on the other side of the monster from you or you run the risk of knocking them over with your extendy bendy hitboxes. The biggest offenders are usually charge attacks either your normal or Shield Assault just take care when you use them.,MonsterHunter,d7jgsub,4,t5_2rron

Potentially Critstatus would add more status over time but this is generally regarded to be an insignificant boost in status application and it might not even be possible to add to your set.Your set is pretty great. I would just go with it as is. Reworking would probably end up changing your whole set but since you are asking...Minds Eye on the armor is not that useful. I hardly even bounce with Deathprize bouncing is most noticeable on the DreadKing.  But if I know I will Ill just take the White Oil and everything is OK. You could drop the Akantor Mask R and get Hayabusa Feather instead. Increasing crit always helps in the end game.Other useful skills to consider are CritChain which is easy to maintain on SNS. Critical Boost would be nice on top but this might be difficultimpossible to get a set for with your other skills.Personally I like some of the slot skills Mushromancer and halvestun.,MonsterHunter,d7kbnn7,1,t5_2rron
8925655,0,t1_d7kjovn,Tigrexs only attack besides AoE roars spins and throwing rocks is to charge or jump straight at you. Getting Evade Extender or sheathing your weapon before he charges should give you plenty of time to avoid his attacks. For the rest of the hunt standing right underneath him between his front and back legs is the safest place you can be and when he falls over smash his head into the pavement.

8935648,0,t1_d7lwhz6,Its not really about building decent gauge and more about which one builds more gauge and has better preset moves. Why build decent gauge when you can build mathematically better gauge? About the usefulness of piercing boomerang on assist supports even forgetting that it quadruples your damage to where youre actually contributing something to the hunt there is not a monster on which the  gauge investment wont pay off with the gauge generation boost you get from it since bar generation is tied to the motion values of your attacks.The only argument against this is that you waste a skill slot. But really there arent enough good support skills to justify the loss of damage and gauge generation. Your best options for the learned skill would be Demon Horn the effects of which you would outdamage by your own with piercing boomerangs Armor Horn its just not very good Cheer horn see armor horn but worse or a skill that you could get in the general moves but didnt so just roll a better cat.Honestly you dont seem the type to listen to logical arguments so Ill just stop replying to this thread seriously play however you enjoy most.

8951799,0,t1_d7nslbu,Narga LS has  affinity with the skills on this set it goes up to  thats a waste of  affinity. You could go down to CE and probably fit some other skill in with practically no loss.About the LS comparisons I didnt do all of the math personally. Simply put about  of speedrunners use either Hellblade usually or Silverwind more rarely so they must be onto something. For other classes it varies a bit more but  blademaster classes have Hellblade as the most used weapon and in  of those  cases its used more than  of the time. Building your Absolute readinessevasion and other HAs  faster is extremely valuable.Honestly it bothers me quite a bit that theres an optimal weapon and set thats almost the same in all cases in MHGen but thats the truth of it. I still enjoy the game and divert my attention to building sets for clearly suboptimal strategies as trying to reinvent the wheel with a new crit stacking set is a pointless endeavour. Add to that the fact that sharing sets is mostly pointless because of how charms work and you have a sad hunter.But yeah you nailed it its not the best all around set but its great until you find your own sharpness  ooo. Thing is youre not that much more likely to have an expert  ooo than a sharpness  ooo so once again though good for people in your situation thats not what you would call a template set so its not generally extremely useful.,MonsterHunter,d7nvfr1,1,t5_2rron

9105987,0,t1_d86dumz,gt I figured his argument was more about how you keep acting like randomly generated content is a hugely justified reasoning for which game to play.MY argument is that his original premise that MHGen has more content is unsubstantiated because he is deliberately leaving out the procedurally generated content out of MHU.Now look I dont care how much you like it or not like it. The fact of the matter is that MHUs procedurally generated content vastly increases its mathematical content count. Everything else is purely subjective.This entire argument is him trying to argue that the procedurally generated content should be discounted. No it cannot be discounted just because it is convenient. Look. What you like or dislike about that content is absolutely irrelevant to the math. Mathematical modeling argued that Hilary Clinton would win the DNC nomination. All the Bernie Sanders supporters refused to believe this. Look where we are now. Your personal opinion does not discredit the math.Yes you can hate Donald Trump all you want. It does not change the fact that mathematically he earned the majority of the nominating votes from the Republican party. How you feel about it is irrelevant the numbers are the points that are being made.THIS is my point.  The assertion that MHGen has more content than MHU is mathematically false. The only metrics we can operationalize this is in content count and the procedurally generated content in U is responsible for the vast possibilities in MHU. Im not interesting in selling anything else. This entire thing devolved into one person deliberately arguing why it should be discounted because he does not like that content. This is terrible because your personal opinion of a matter does not change the fact and it should not but here it did.,MonsterHunter,d86e6e9,2,t5_2rron

9119919,0,t1_d87i4n1,I get your points why you like the story but still I cant comply.My issue with the caravan is well the story. Your sole reason to travel to Val Habar in the first place is Joining the Hunters Guild. So why should I change my mind all of the sudden because a Mohran attacked me would make more sense to ask for the Hunters Guilds help in the first place. Dunno about rd generation but being no smithery in the guild hall was kinda stupid. maybe there isnt one because the guild hall is well in Val Habar. Except the Wycoon there doesnt seem to be any other advantage in being the caravan. Not sure if the Guild Hall uses the Caravaneers way of movement though. But that would have been the best entry point for the caravaneers story in my opinion.I know about MH and not having High Rank Caravan story. But despite not having the desert I dont see a point in there. Though they could have added it from begin with.The reason you liked the Ace Hunters is exactly the reason why I dislike them. Using some overhyped characters and making them lose against some monster is an overly used mechanic to emphasize the strength of that monster. It is so bad but still game devs use it.Why not having several fights were it basically crushes you and you barely have chances to escape. I would feel immersion that way. For me its lazy game design the way it is. Im just not the type for that and thats why I dont want the story to be like that in the next main series game.,MonsterHunter,d882du4,1,t5_2rron

9130436,0,t3_55c392,Name SlingType Both?Summary Its a fucking sling... A rope or chain or leather what ever you fancy holding a square piece of leather or some more rows of rope to hold stones one end has a loop for your finger or your wrist and the other you hold in the same hand you swing the it around with a rock and let go of the rope the loop will stay around your finger and the other end leaves your hand and the rock flies forward. BUT Pressing RXA will change your stance to a Melee stance allowing your to whip your enemies of course its a sling so their is no sharpness modifier there still is a stat to determine how Sharp the weapon is that determines weather you will bounce or not meaning you wont deal more damage with a higher sharpness how ever to increase the damage of the melee sling you can place a projectile in to the sling and use that to whip the monster allowing you to deal more blunt damage doing this will slowly break the item until it becomes nothing but dust forcing you to replace the projectile again to maintain the damage buffSome slings can have different projectiles loaded in to them allowing you to throw or whip around like flash bombs and sonic bombs Potions Demon drugArmour skin earplugs and more. All of these items are significantly weakened meaning that your buffs only last a short while and your potions heal as much as a potion. Each ammo type deals different amounts of damage in both stances and has different effects in melee and range. Your stones how ever will always be your bread and butter ammunitionCombos and attacks Pressing R will start the swing and slowly drain stamina I mean slower than your running stamina drain Pressing R again will stop the swing. L plus B and L plus X cycles though ammo Pressing X while swinging will launch the projectilepressing A will load the next one. In melee pressing X will do a horizontal swipe and pressing A will do a vertical swipe pressing R will load a projectile in the sling to whip with.Hunter Arts Boulder swing in ranged a large boulder is lifted out of the ground and the hunter spins for a few seconds holding the sling with both hands the hunter can wait as the boulder powers up to deal more damage but if the hunter waits to long the hunter will become dizzy and have to stop dropping and breaking the boulder. Each level allows the boulder to deal more blunt damage and allows for more spinning time. In melee the Hunter places a boulder in to the swing and spins once then throws the weight forward keeping the boulder in the sling launching the boulder and himself forward and upward in to the monster dealing large amounts of blunt damage. Each level increases damage and distance.Stone Hailstones The hunter aims to the sky and launches multiple of the currently selected ammunition in the air dealing damage to any target in a decently sized area but not tripping hunters or buffing and healing all players in the same range. Each level increases the range and number of projectiles launched. In melee the Hunter swings their sling with extreme haste doing  lemniscates and then pulling out. Each level increases the amount of lemniscates performed.Edit Minor Text FixesAlso your weapon is just a Charge blade on crack and if I wanted a Charge blade on Crack I would use the Switch Axe. It seems broken in its current state. IMO you should just ditch the sword and leave a shield like a tower shield or something. Just less OP.,MonsterHunter,d89cjxo,5,t5_2rron

You are also required to get all types of cats fightingassistgatheringetc... to lvl  and finish all palico quests whether they are village or hub quests. Once all criteria have been met you will unlock a cat only quest in the village called Hungry Mama. Instead of a hunt the quest will be a straight up minigame where your cat will run around collecting food dishes from the various cooks from all villages to feed a large ginormous female cat the size of a Gogmazio. Complete the quest by satiating her hunger and you will unlock a special palico skill from Neko Means Cat called Nekos Cry which summons Mama to the hunting fields. Skill description A one time per hunt summon that requires at least  palico skill bars to use and prevents the bar from being refilled for the next  minutes. Mama Felyne is summoned by the cries of her darling felyne child and comes to check. She will fall from the sky onto the fields and upon arriving Palico Mama so fat she strikes fear into the monsters eyes draining the monstersin the area of all stamina instantlyremoves anger status immediately and causes fatigue. She will then roll towards the monsters striking them for a raw unmitigated pts of damage and sending them flying out of the area.

9134392,0,t1_d89tu1x,Okay then yes designed to finished in  minutes at endtier. My point isnt trying to make the specifics of how itd work as I said itd take some time developing the right times and everything. My point is I would much rather have a quest that unlocks after youve completed EVERY hunt that is VERY difficult so as to unlock Godtiers. Doing a hunt designed for  minutes with  minute wiggle room IS frustrating. But so is grinding for  hours in a nonMMO. And Id rather take the frustration of lack of skill than the frustration of just  more hours to go!  Make it designed for  minutes if you want the number of perfect charms to maintain the way it is which defeats the purpose of changing the talisman system if you want to maintain perfect talisman rates then dont change itAgain I would just rather have my perfect talisman locked behind a very high difficulty wall as opposed to a very high patience wall. Making it so you have to do every hunt before hand would be the alright. One more tier to go until I get to do the Big One. And the difficulty ramping up from the already difficult hunts would only serve to get your more excited. This quest was insane! And theres one harder! I need to get so much better! And then when you finish the Final Hunt youre rewarded with your personalized Godtier talisman with which you can exact revenge on the pesky monsters that gave you issues by devising the perfect runs to slaughter them or you use it to start speed running your favorite monster. Having to grind for  hours means you know pull spend at least  days straight doing it. I dont like seeing the wall of time ahead of me even if its easy to wait out. Id rather see the wall with no handholds that Im expected to climb. Could take me  hours. Could take me . Could take me  hours. But at the end of the day it took me as long as it did because I was the one doing it. My Skill level dictates how long I was stuck at the wall not some grinding mechanic that Im at the mercy of.,MonsterHunter,d89umbq,1,t5_2rron

MH goes deep man I love looking into the lore.Edit To address the Rajang thing its less likely that Rajang is mutated by the lightning since every monster roars when firing a blastbeamthing its just what they do but more that the lightning just runs its course through his spinal cord and synapses allowing for hyperstimulation and rapidfiring of action potentials. Rajangs attacks are already faster simply due to its naturally smaller size and being fourlegged granting better agility and maneuverability now supercharged with lightning.

Attack Up skills Handicraft depending on the weapon Affinity boosting skills element boosting skills etc. Definitely keep razor sharp you can keep evasion  if you wish though I dont find it necessary Dont go past evasion  since the dash evade isnt long enough to warrant use of evasion . Evading with aerial style takes some practice as well. The invincibility frames on the evade itself is different and the jump itself has invincibility frames you can abuse as seen in this video Also the Airborne skill or Vault increase your jumping attack damage by  which can go well with aerial style.Hope this helps!,MonsterHunter,d8pxsdv,3,t5_2rron

9345629,0,t3_58hknq,Hmmm....couple of things.  It says released March  which would mean that at most thats  months between announcement and release. Seems a bit short for an HD Monster Hunter. That would seem to indicate more of a spinoff type title.   million units expected sold. Thats a bit low if it was a mainline DS MH game MHU and MHXGen sold more already theres no way an MH on the DS wont sell more than that in Japan. Im not sure how well the spinoffs do but a spinoff of a really popular series in MH could probably sell  million. But a mainline game on a newlyreleased console could ALSO have about a  million unit estimate not going to be as popular as past entries on existing hardware but popular enough to sell a decent amount.

So if it costs an extra  or so to switch Its still worth it.X is a departure from the series and introduces new gameplay mechanics. It might be easier and funner for a beginner but at the same time it will be startling when playing the other games in the series that dont have hunter artsstyles which makes X way easier to play. So if you just want the funnest game possible maybe go with X but if you want to really get into the series go with U.

Current Poison Tolerance  Statusvalue per hit Hits needed to poison the monster approximateNow...    Total Poison Damage  Hits neededWhich gives you the approximate amount of damage dealt by every strike until the status is afflicted the first time.Example Deadly Poison SnS  Poison against Rathian  Initial Increase     Poison   Hits   Poison per Hit     Tolerance   Poison per Hit   Hits to reach her ToleranceWe need approximately  hits to poison Rathian the first time so we divide the  Poison damage she takes with the  hits needed to trigger it...

Tolerance   Poison per Hit   Hits to reach her Tolerance     Damage   Hits   Damage per Hit.So after being affected by Poison once the Deadly Poison only deals  additional damage per hit.This is why weapons that focus purely on Poison or Blast are often not worth it because the ones with the most Poison or Blast also often have awful Sharpness andor Raw to overcompensate.,MonsterHunter,d920adf,1,t5_2rron

9436164,0,t1_d9blqlc,I think they actually mentioned somewhere in the translation notes on capcom unity for U that they actually started translating  but G came out before they could finish so they just jumped up to that game and continued. With that in mind U took a LOT longer than  months to translate. And even if Generations is translated already you have to keep in mind that there will likely be a vast amount of game added with this. If they still go with this split village idea thats  new sets of separate high rank quests which will be numerous. One new village would be much easier sure but it kinda removes the use of Yukumo Village and to an extent Pokke Village it has the sword for a little while until you build all the stuff you need from it.Online will be slightly better but its still a vast amount of quests new characters new dialogue etc.Then of course you have translations for the new areas and monsters any new items all the new weapons all the new armors of course palicos are probably gonna need a butt tonne of new skills so thats more stuff oh yeah the new styles and arts of course thats more work and we STILL havent even mentioned DLC.Im not expecting miracles with this honestly my only hope is that it manages to come out before the Switch does over here since to my knowledge that still only has a Japan release date? since I want to devote my time to one or the other..,MonsterHunter,d9c3llf,1,t5_2rron

This is the only way I was able to stop the CPP from turning off every time I booted up the game.Edit  Turns out this bug only existed in MHU. They fixed it in Generations.Also the CPU graphics chip and RAM on the OG DS and OG DSXL and DS are the exact same. The New DS and New DSXL share their upgrades as they have the same parts for CPU graphics and RAM. Heres the compatibility chart on Wikipedia of all five DS systems.Edited the New DS segment for clarityOP could test the Cstick in the MHGen Main Menus Options screen using the Calibrate Right Circle Pad option.

9531088,0,t1_d9llllu,Gogmazios and Nakarkos are indeed seriously awesome I also adored the first fight with Dalamadur seriously hes one of the best first time fights in MHU however I couldnt really enjoy him after the first time mostly due to the fact that he does the same thingsBite bite bite roar split the ground like an airbender RAAAGE death laser bite across the map death laser let people climb you rinse and repeat while sometimes he changed his pattern he wasnt really a good fight to farm him  times while Nakarkos and Gogmazios both suffered from that issue they were solved by taking a break from them as both of them do different things every fight and are quite unpredictable I think if Dalamadur is to return he should have a fair share of move patterns so he can be comparable to the other two that and that he constantly tries to attack you would make the fight a lot more fun,MonsterHunter,d9nwnrk,1,t5_2rron

9717964,0,t1_daaxunk,While admittedly it could be shown better Ive always thought that as a monster gets older it gets bigger and stronger. Or perhaps it happens from fighting experience.The fact that bigger monsters are a bit stronger and that deviants are a lot bigger than the normal version.Hell even the small monsters could just be juvenile versions of the large monsters. Thats the impression I got when I first saw the Jaggis and the Great Jaggi. The Great Jaggi isnt some kind of similar but stronger species but is the Silverback of the Jaggis. Repeatedly winning challenges from other Jaggis make it the strongest which causes physical changes. Just like the Silverback Gorillas and many other species in the real world.,MonsterHunter,daay7hh,4,t5_2rron

Any advice?I need help with monster hunter generationsJust started Playing need some adviceAnd of course the search results...New cold alone and entirely lost. Anyone willing to help this poor newbie out?New to the Monster Hunter Franchise and need some help.After hearing from the Dark Souls subreddits about Monster Hunter Im dying to check it out. Slightly more oriented to DS playersAnd copypastaEach piece of armor gives points towards certain skills. When your total across all equipped gear reaches  points for a skill it activates until then it does nothing. So  points of Attack doesnt affect your damage at all but  points activates Attack Up Small. Some skills have additional tiers at  and  points some have negative versions at  points. Decorations like Attack Jewel fit into slots on weapons armor and charms and add more points. Charms are an equipment slot that add points and slots but no defense or resistance points. Start with the village quests they ease you in teach you stuff and unlock a lot of things. Element resistances arent that big of a deal defense has a bigger effect on damage. Try all of the weapon types see which ones you like. Sharpness affects damage and how likely you are to bounce keep it high. Weapons that attack faster work best with element weapons that attack slower work best with high raw. NEVER SELL EARTH CRYSTALS. You will need hundreds. Other materials are fine to sell but try to keep a good amount of them for crafting things. I usually sell down to  of a monster material and  of an ore. Kiranico is a fantastic resource. Read the NPC dialog. A lot of people skip through it and end up stuck or think plot stuff is a glitch. Dont be impatient read the dialog know what to do and enjoy it.  When you hit a monster with a melee weapon youll see some blood come out. The larger the blood splash the more damage that part takes. If you bounce you lose twice as much sharpness parts that bounce have low raw hitzones which means less raw damage so avoid them. If you find yourself getting hit by a monster a lot try just staying back and watching its attacks. Look for openings to attack in and when to dodge an attack.Use that search function yall.,MonsterHunter,dah3edi,12,t5_2rron

9843029,0,t1_daqi3o6,gt It actually depends on the set you can makeDaidalos Axe has very high raw damage but green sharpness some blue with Sharpness .  Because of the sharpness raw damage modifiers the green sharpness x. Daidalos with  raw is equivalent to a white sharpness x. weapon with  raw  which is roughly on par with Baraq Sedition and the Silverwind Axe.  The optimal damage boost setup for Switch Axe is probably Crit Boost  as much affinity as you can stack with Critical Eye  and Energy Charge.The full Silverwind armor set grants Critical Boost and Critical Eye .  If used with Baraq Sedition your baseline affinity is  and with Energy Charge III your affinity is temporarily boosted to .    I prefer Baraq Sedition for the two slots so I can get another armor skill Attack Up M or Constitution  and I rarely drop below white sharpness with the autosharpening feature.    On the other hand Silverwind Axe has slightly higher raw damage  vs  but slightly lower affinity  vs  and no slots.  And of course it charges the Hunter Arts gauge faster.    This is just my opinion but if using full Silverwind armor my preference would be Baraq Sedition or Magma Axe Hellblade,MonsterHunter,daqkir4,3,t5_2rron

9925340,0,t1_db0gkll,The fact that you had to take the monster who as of this point has the worst pairing of base HP to good hitzones says a lot. Now take a look at solos of other endgame quests  amatsu generally around mins.  Alatreon mins.  golden pair  or sub mins  Out of the fry pan sub   Hyper Rajang around minutes  etc.Most endgame quests or multi monster quests can be cleared sub  or  without much trouble by players that arent top tier skill wise at the game except maybe  hypers at once especially if they dont all lend well to the weaponstyle combo you use because thats literally an HP bath right there especially if armed with traps and if you leave the palicos at home they draw too much aggro away and greatly impede your ability to do damage . Hyper silver los being a bitch due to terrible hitzones coupled with massive base HP is what makes it ridiculous the better designed hyper monster quests even DLCs are nowhere as bad take the Hyper Astalos  Hyper Glavenus for example theyre still hypered meat shields but they go down much faster due to better hitzones and no time wasted flying around. I mean hyper rajang has ridiculous HP but he has great hitzones.

10021808,0,t3_5j7622,Here is the honest truth. MHGen is by far the easiest Monster Hunter in the series. So much so you can solo every quest up until HR Urgent Nakarkos. As far as playing online this generation of hunters is a might bit selfish about quests however im Hr and i see low level hr groups  of the time. So if you dont mind hunting everyone elses key quests which do count towards your own youll be just fine.Getting people to join your room may be difficult because like i said this game in my experience has garnered alot of selfish hunters. Still trust and believe that every quest is soloable unless youre absolutely new to the series. To answer your specific request though Hr is a good starting point if you need help desperately.

Watch how it strikes what direction it strokes from and where it pauses between to allow you to hit back. Once you get that down wack it for a bit. Once you see an effect of some sort foam or fire at the mouth is most common its enraged. Until you are more experienced.... put your weapon away and run around. Let it tire itself out and you will see many more openings where it stops to catch its breath... thats when you can really be aggressive. Other than that try out some different weapons. The training you can do to practice with them is absolutely amazing and I recommend you try that a few rounds. ,MonsterHunter,dbe7t9p,2,t5_2rron

Thats a total of somewhere around  Pierce shots and  normal shots.  Most people will run out of timecarts before they run out of ammo.My guess is most people are turned off by the ammo management although it really isnt that complicated.  Pierce  and combines will cover pretty much anything.  Most of LR village can be done with just rapid fire Pierce  without even needing combines or other lvls of Pierce.Also Pierce guns can be brought to pretty much everything and do well even smaller monsters like dromes or seltas.

10183946,0,t1_dbxrsg4,Agreed I believe the real issue is that Sharpness X was implicitly nerfed in three different ways. First is obviously the  split the second is that many end game weapons do not need Handicraft at all and third as you point out is due to it not getting many points due to this game being High Rank only.Sharpness is only good when there are ways to use it to its full potential. Sharpness  can be just as good as previous if there are end game weapons that benefit from it enough to warrant using armor that grants it. Same goes for Sharpness . I think like you say Sharpness will come back in G Rank with Purple Sharpness. And I bet we will see all the current white sharpness weapons drop down to blue for high rank to leave space for g rank upgrades.,MonsterHunter,dbyend6,1,t5_2rron

10283087,0,t3_5n8wam,Make sure you are bringing the proper gun to a fight. Look up weaknesses for both element and raw and choose the one that will do the most damage. Utilize rapid fire along with the above. Bring combines for more ammoDo keep in mind multimonster quests are the bane of the gunners existence specifically from the issue of running out of ammo so if you are encountering that problem youre gonna want to pay extra attention to which hitzones are the best to hit. For skills try getting ammo type up if using PiercePelletNormal or Element  for elemental builds. If you are using adept you should be fine to have lower defense just enough to not get shot. Adept HBG is surprisingly effective and not nearly as restrictive on mobility as one might think. You can adept dodge out of siege fire at a moments notice not like the  second delay you would experience in U. I find a good normal or pierce gun on HBG shreds anything offline youll encounter. Bow gets the bonus of never running out of ammo. You may run out of coatings but never out of ammo. Similarly Adept bow is also very impressive with an immediate level  charge Level  if you have focus and load up. So hopefully some of that helped a little bit!,MonsterHunter,dc9n7k5,2,t5_2rron

The most useful part of armor is skills.Each piece of armor gives points towards certain skills. When your total across all equipped gear reaches  points for a skill it activates until then it does nothing. So  points of Attack doesnt affect your damage at all but  points activates Attack Up Small. Some skills have additional tiers at  and  points some have negative versions at  points. Decorations like Attack Jewel fit into slots on weapons armor and charms and add more points. Charms are an equipment slot that add points and slots but no defense or resistance points.,MonsterHunter,dcg0y9b,2,t5_2rron

Is this correct? Granted the lower his health the more frequently he becomes enraged but this is also when he becomes more mobile and the openings shorten.I do try to strike the head if he is enraged but when he is not enraged I also go for his wings if they are not broken so as to get the free stumble.

Does it go down with no input? If you press directly upwards to the stick with the cap removed it goes upwards and same with all directions?If the DS without the cap works well it was my case then the problem most probably is that the PSP cap has wethered with use and doesnt fit as well as when it was new. Take into account that the PSP cap is wider that the DS stick so it may lean towards one direction if its a bit wethered.To solve it what I did was to fit it diagonally. The grip is MUCH tighter to the point that to fit it you have to actually press with force do it at your own risk if you feel it may break your DS stick stop dont held me responsable if something happens xDDD.

The kitties bring you back to camp? Youre finished bud. No quest fails. Killed the monster on a capture quest? Though shit youre done. You may do any given quest only once. Check marked quests are off limits cant do them anymore. How you deal with subquests in Gen is up to you though I would consider them off limits to preserve the spirit of the challenge. U only No Everwood cheese. So no farming the same monster through Everwood runs and you can enter the Everwood at all only when a previously there unseen monster appears.   No multiplayer under any circumstance. No buying what you can make yourself so potions energy drinks ammo etc. must all be handcrafted. Use only one type of weapon both so that you actually get to upgrade anything and for the challenge.And there you have it.The original author of this challenge linked at the beginning made it all the way through Gogmazios in U so its definetly possible to do this.Just gather kill and carve EVERYTHING.,MonsterHunter,dcu4pqc,3,t5_2rron

Luckily its real easy in this game.The bugs that people most use is Speed  for the  Affinity on getting White and the Balanced bug for giving your essence statups to other people in the same party.

For the actual full hunt demo it isnt as big of a concern as that is more a proof of concept.gt Some of the monster themes are a bit too agressive  distracting imho ie Deviljho and could distract the viewers.

Watched both guide videos and understood everything so no worries there.gt Wrong information is definitively something we dont want in our videos we will make sure to ask for any doubt we could have before uploading the next videos in this sub in the future.The game itself is also a great source as quite a fair bit of info can be discerned from just the combat.A good rule of thumb of when to fact check is to ask yourself Do I know that this is true or only think that it is?. My critique tends to lean more towards the blunt and concrete so pardon me if it came off as a little hostile was not certainly intended as such.Overall you have a very strong start with these videos Teostra especially definitely something to view as your baseline so dont let my pedantic comments get to you.,MonsterHunter,dd2986w,2,t5_2rron

Like having giggis with no Gigginox is just a bit weird..MHGen already have a very big variety of monsters due to deviants that can compete with MHU adding more older monster and deviants will only make it surpass it.X and XX are supposed to be a anniversary type game to include most of the older monsters.

10569638,0,t1_dd663ld,Oh of course. There definitely will be plenty more put back in along with new deviants and a new endgame monster. My question is more of the fact that even bringing back every original monster in the game still doesnt IMO increase the difficulty of a certain monster species all that much or keep peoples interests in fighting them. But again that is my opinion others may feel different.Edit For example. I find G rank Zamtrios to be kind of easy but I find TS Zamtrios to be definitely harder because of its attack pattern. I also personally enjoy fighting Zamtrios more because I have  kinds to fight. ,MonsterHunter,dd66b3j,7,t5_2rron

10625196,0,t3_5rvx5x,. Online can be a big part of the game if you want it to be. Theres plenty to do in and out of the Guild Hall where you set up online functions and missions.

I would say that once youve accustomed yourself to the game controls and gotten yourself some decent armorweapons you could spend all of your time online with no repercussions.. On Gen its been easy to find people for me. On MHU I dont know how the online community is nowadays but a lot of people are considering it one of the best entries in the series so I would assume the online is still relatively healthy there.. It does though Im not sure what the rate is exactly sorry about this answer.. Not really no. Theres a weapon that you can buff and heal a little with but thats not its sole intention.

I actually played Adept SA throughout the Village campaign it utilizes both modes and it was super super fun. Unfortunately then I went Striker and the damage was just unbelievable so I never went back. The most fun part of Adept SA is that you frequently morph back and forth trying to get in that axe mode finisher and then go back into sword. The gauge mechanic used to be an upkeep axe mode was how you paid for sword time but its just pointless now it would be awesome to be able to just freely use both.Or yknow just leave it how it is and X X X X X sidestep X X X X X X X X Energy Charge X X X X.... until the heat death of the universe,MonsterHunter,ddfjagu,6,t5_2rron

10766477,0,t3_5u0r1i,The tricky thing with SnS is that good fighting somewhat requires you to be hyperaggressive but its also way easier to fight that way with it because all of its attacks have so little commitment and the XA dash attack lets you capitalize on openings from farther away. The high number of hits lends itself well to elemental and status I like to have a sword for each element so I can always bring something that the monster is weak to.You can also do the ledge climbing jump attack by rolling into the ledge and pressing A as youre climbing.Tip for multiplayer since it fights at close quarters and doesnt move much during its combo its easy to get knocked around by friendly fire but the XA attack protects you from friendly fire for a couple of seconds after so you can have room to  do a proper combo.,MonsterHunter,ddqhdjb,4,t5_2rron

10880196,0,t3_5vfm1d,MHU was the Monster Hunter game that really clicked for me after spending little time in Freedom Unite and MHU previously but not really getting addicted to either of them. I fell in love with the Insect Glaive but remembered that back in those last two games I was a fan of the Dual Blades and Gunlance so I made some of those along the way as well.Fast forward to after several several hours in GRank with my best friend and Ive learned how to play Switch Axe Long Sword a bit of Great Sword and dabbled in some Gunner play. I made it a point that whenever I wanted to farm a monster I would always make every weapon from it that I knew how to play. For example Gore and Shagaru Magala died countless times for their Mantles so that I could create at least four Blademaster weapons out of them and the Bow. Included with the armory I had amassed were always new Gunlances but... I had to face it.Im hopelessly awful with Gunlances. Im so used to the flowing fighting style of the Insect Glaive  and more importantly rolling out of the way of attacks  that I cant get used to a weapon that requires you to stand your ground in the face of danger by guarding with a bigass shield. The thought of taking chip damage throughout the fight and then somehow trying to avoid the few attacks that are unblockable with such a glacial movement speed just cant click with me. Yes I know about utilizing the backhops to move around and how Guard  and Guard Up work but Im not about to put in the time to build an armor set based around my worstperforming weapon in the game in terms of kill times and damage taken throughout the fight.Which sucks because the Daora and Shagaru ones that I built are absolutely beautiful.TLDR  I built a bunch of Gunlances in MHU that I ended up never using because I suck ass at playing it.

A few of them dont even count as separate monsters like Jho Jang and Daora.Subspecies are basically the exact same thing they just tend to look aesthetically more different or have a different element than the base species.Deviants are kind of like what if a monster grew old and its evolution took a left turn into the extreme.

11063497,0,t3_5xw5xr,Im pretty sure affinity doesnt affect any gauge increase. Ive never read any reliable sources claiming that it does and to me it doesnt really make sense for it to. None of the gauges are based on your final damage number or it would be very clear that gauges charged significantly faster in late game than early game. So why should affinity be factored in?LS spirit gauge The Bassy page for G states that this gauge is based on motion value with a cap of  with a multiplier based on hitstop level. No mention of total damage or affinity just motion value sharpness and hitzone hitstop is based on the latter two. With how often Weakness Exploit is used its very possible that people mistake the hitstop bonus for affinity affecting it. DB demon gauge Im unforuntately not seeing as much documentation on this. I suspect it may be similar to LS but thats just a hunch. Hunter Arts The guidebook lists a HA gauge increase value for each attack thats the same as the motion value. Again no mention of affinity but also no mention of hitstop. ,MonsterHunter,dem12v1,1,t5_2rron

11077233,0,t3_5y6k06, Cant remember the specifics but being knocked down by certain things will put your weapon away. If I remember correctly its Quake Stun Pin Failed Mount  Paralysis not sure on this one. Wind Pressure and normal attacks wont put your weapon away.   No excuse for this one except maybe bad positioning on your part. If its not an arena quest it would be wise to bring dung bombs to separate them. And for arena bring farcaster ingredients and go back to the camp when the fence is on cooldown. Dealing with  monsters at once isnt something you want to do. Alternatively bring smoke bombs and throw one before the encounter to prevent the other monster to notice you for about a minute. Just because their tells arent clear enough doesnt mean its not there. No excuse for some of the instacharges but you definitely can adopt your play style to deal with it. They usually have pretty wide openings when theyre not intending to charge. The Gen  Elder Dragons are initially designed to be fought over multiple quests. If you reduce its health enough and the time reaches a certain point it will retreat but keep its health and broken parts for the next encounter. The general procedure would be to come back with higherranking gear before taking them on since they do hit harder and have more health than the normal monsters in the same rank.,MonsterHunter,denlem7,9,t5_2rron

Once they become available in stores you can buy them in bulk for cheap. Just wait for item shops to put their stock on  sale and load up sales happen periodically so check in often. If youre not yet at the point you can buy potions that means youre still in early low rank. The First Aids in the supply box go a long way towards stretching your potion stock. Likewise youll likely gather a decent pile of ingredients from doing gathering quests.I suggest you instead use your cats to keep you topped off on the ingredients necessary for the more potent healing items such as Mega Potions Max Potions Ancient Potions and Lifepowders. ,MonsterHunter,df3wnwi,1,t5_2rron

Then you can cut off a bit of extra rubber and pop it right back on if you ever have an issue and want the horrible rubber nub back!Once the scary part is over and you have the nub off theres a little plastic square that actually senses how youre touching the cstick. The PSP caps attack on with an oval shape so you just need to line the straight sides of the oval up with the DSs square peg thingy. The videos make much more sense than I can describe! But I popped mine on it didnt look right I took it off and made a small adjustment and it popped right on BEAUTIFULLY. I have about  hours in MH since making the switch and I have had zero issues with it its way more responsive! I can actually press DOWN and have it work and it works AMAZINGLY BETTER with nasty sweaty hands from getting railed by Zinogre. It isnt PERFECT it does slip a little bit when REALLY sweaty but basically it works as well as the circle pad does now.

11325239,0,t1_dffngyj,Not with yellow they struggle if you get up to blue with .The main example I have is the hammer. In gen if you build around sharpnesscrit you can end up with a blue sharp hammer with  raw and around  affinity. Issue is in Gen its outclassed by the ancient blow if built similarly or the tigrex hammer if given attack L and weakness exploit which is handily given by dreadking.In XX it eventually becomes the aged hammer which can get up to white sharpness helpful. If we give is S and negative crit skill we can probably get in more here but just doing a similar comparison we get. listed raw damage. White sharpness.  raw.x.x.  true raw per hit on average.The upgraded version of the stone fist also gets white sharp but with  affinity and  slots. Being at  affinity itll still benefit more from Weakness exploit.x.x.  true raw. With  slots and weakness exploit being fairly reasonable to obtain its probably still going to outclass the worn hammer.Finally Ill check the tigrex hammer once more. This has  raw  affinity two slots and natural purple sharpness. Due to natural purple Ill check it with dreadking again which ups raw by another  and gives weakness exploit. This results in  total positive affinity.x.x. true raw average per hit. Keep in mind the higher natural sharpness of tigrex will mean any other additional buffs such as power charmtalon or kitchen food will receive a boost from the purple.So yes the worn weapons are probably viable but theyre going to be outclassed by the standard weapons of gen and youre going to need a very specialised build to make them usable. Even then with the new nega crit skill youll be doing approx  less damage than the best of their class weapons assuming they even still are.,MonsterHunter,dffp3v0,1,t5_2rron

11402604,0,t1_dfof9c5,Well since you asked questions related to some mechanics I know a lot about Ill dump a bunch of data on you. When people say fixed damage what it really means is that it ignores hitzones. Quest defense and I believe rage mode defense modifiers still apply. So if its a late high rank MHGen quest it will be .x quest defense so     .   damage to the monsters HP. Bombs and all other attacks outside of Pierce S and Pierce Bow only hit one hitzone. So if a bomb explosion looks like it hits multiple parts it only really hits the first one the game considers it to touch. A little known detail is that while sleep gives a x modifier to bombs other items and ranged attacks but a x modifier to melee attacks it also applies a .x modifier towards stagger thresholds. This means a bomb on a sleeping monster does     quest defense to the monsters HP and     .  quest defense to its stagger threshold. Another neat little detail breaks. Breaks with the exception of tail cuts and similar things like Barroths crown are based on number of staggers. Most breaks only require  stagger but some break on the second stagger. If you do enough damage to reach two stagger thresholds you can get a break in one hit. Sleeping monsters only give the modifier to one hit so the game will somehow determine one of the bombs as being first. Or rather the game somehow decides that one of the bombs got triggered by the stoneattacksmall bombwhatever first and that one gets the sleep multiplier and sets off the other bomb.,MonsterHunter,dfogynp,1,t5_2rron

11406403,0,t3_62smz5,To my knowledge there are two ways Purchase a physical copy of the game Cubic Ninja.  This game is able to scan QR codes to share user created puzzles or something idk.  A while ago someone figured out that scanning a specific QR code enabled an exploit very similar to Smash Stack if youve ever set up Project M.  Basically it boots files which you store on the SD card to run homebrew software without actually hacking the DS to install it.  There is a way to use this in order to disable region locking on your system but I dont know the specifics of it.  Also since the digital copy of the game was taken down from the eShop once Nintendo learned of this you must find a physical copy.  These can be a bit tricky to come by and are often scalped a bit due to knowledge of the exploit.  If you can find one for cheap then its one of the easier methods of doing this and also one of the safer since you arent actually installing any software. Use homebrew software directly.  Basically you just bite the bullet and learn how to install such software.  After doing so the process for disabling region locking should be fairly similar to the Cubic Ninja method.  Once again I havent actually done this nor do I know the process so you have to do some research to get those answers.Hope that helped a bit.  Note that in order for everything to stay set up properly I believe you cannot update the game and thus you cannot play online.  You can still go to the hub and stuff but everything you do will be solo.

But now that I think about it it probably wouldnt take too much more space.uClericKnight Blights are basically status effects you can have Fireblightbeing set on fire causes damage over time IceblightBeing coated in ice causes stamina to deplete faster and a few others. If your elemental resistance is high enough you can cause them to happen less often or negate them entirely. Even with that elemental resistances are not that important and you can usually ignore them but it might be nice to have some elemental resistance against certain monsters.,MonsterHunter,dfwspas,1,t5_2rron

11614852,0,t1_dgc6n3i,Lance took me forever now I main it. Only reason I gave it a shot was from getting a perfect relic in MHU. You gotta get a feel for chasing monster backwards very unintuitive. Gen makes this part easier with Arts. You also gotta realize what you reach is and you dont have to face up a monster to head poke it. You can be under it facing the same direction as the monster and head poke it. Gen camera is so close that it makes this part harder.

While I may have never made it to alatreon in U recently picked up the game again and set goals of soling both village and grank versions as well as the entire game it really stands out to me in gen. As a kid i always thought of dragons being powerful masters of all elements and alatreon fulfills that childhood pleasure. While the design might seem a little bland to some the sleek black design helps add to some of the ominousness concerning the power. On top of thst i love the look of the gear. As for shagaru u was the first MH game where i actually got serious about it. i love his frenetic fighting style and how it seems so calculated at times. on top of that his fight constantly shows just how much thought went into improving monsters hitboxes since i often find myself barely dodging attacks and thinking if that were a gen  or  monster i would have taken an unnecessary hit. On top of that the frenzy mines some might see it as bs and are probably responsible for the majority of carts in a shaggy hunt as opposed to shaggy himself keep you on your toes and tell you to keep moving instead of sitting in one place and poking it.,MonsterHunter,dge9mge,2,t5_2rron

Gives attack up L one of the biggest attack boosts available for most of low rank.Hub questsWhenever you feel like doing them there really isnt a set point at which to do them.Just be aware theyll be a tad above village quests in difficulty. ,MonsterHunter,dgfwy5i,5,t5_2rron

11695074,0,t1_dgkd4yt,It was mostly in jest But there was some truth to it as well. You must admit that the Hammer HA is a lot more interesting than HHs.

11744423,0,t1_dgqwqv4,U is actually the toughest MH game released in a while. Strictly in terms of the amount of damage monsters deal to players U is very easy until G rank and Generations is even easier until endgame. At least in the early game U is roughly on par with FU maybe slightly less. The main things making U easier than a game like FU are the mounting mechanic and less bullshit hitboxes.Id just recommend to start with U you arent really missing out. Ill say that you should definitely play U on Wii U if possible andor Generations eventually because they have a lot of the fun rd gen monsters that were left out of U. Check out MHFU eventually if you really want to and have a PSP or Vita or dont mind emulating but if you just want to get into the series playing the older games shouldnt be a priority.,MonsterHunter,dgr9djn,1,t5_2rron

11808453,0,t1_dgycdsg,gtYou said that youd prefer it with bigger screen and a controller. Blowing up a p image with  antialiasing isnt what im talking about. When I talk about bigger screens I am also talking about improved resolution too. See MHU. Some weapon textures were a little low res but overall the game was amazing on the big screen and seemed to have some sort of antialiasing processing.gtYou can do that now. So why complain about it? I am talking about realistic and supported situations. Soft modding is prone to having the right version and using custom firmware possibly bricking your device. Not to mention doesnt help people who are less techsavvy. Hard modding costs over  dollars and relying on sending to someone who knows how to do the hard mod. Most people will not go through all these technical hurdles that arent supported. Complaining and making critical assessments are two different things learn the difference.gtYou didnt make a point you simply said...K you clearly werent reading then because my initial point was I am sure some people agree and are just waiting for the next iteration on the switch as it will have better graphics better screen better controller less hand cramping and the capability of playing on a big screen. which if people are already soft modding and hard modding to  DO THIS VERY THING it proves my point.,MonsterHunter,dgyj23d,1,t5_2rron
