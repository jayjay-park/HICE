6160536,0,t3_3zwock,How is it Ubisofts fault and not the game stores? GamestopEB and Best Buy all check games and wouldnt take a game in with no disc for this exact reason. Dont get me wrong it sucks this happened. But its not really Ubisofts fault. What does the Special Edition come with anyways? ,ubisoft,cypw16e,1,t5_2u14q
9726229,0,t3_5d4t4v,Yes it is shit. If you like uber millennial hipster douche politically correct garbage you may enjoy the story and characters. To each their own but as far as gameplay goes... Its controls are clunky driving physics feel like a Nintendo  game shooting mechanics are meh at best soundtrack is god awful and the graphics look like garbage. I would seriously wait for a sale if you have to play it. ,ubisoft,dabyyza,2,t5_2u14q
9942913,0,t3_5hx0v1,Yep all claimed. My clock is synchronised to an NTP server and I hit refresh the moment it rolled over to AM AEST and by the time the page had loaded and registered clicking on the  box they had already been claimed.,ubisoft,db3l3kq,2,t5_2u14q

10862205,0,t3_5v9br5,While I dont like paying more money either the world of game development has completely changed. Gone are the days when AAA games could be done by medium sized teams on a budget. With the increase in quality and size of games means that team size and work stations and other expenses also go up. If you look at a  game from  years ago they dont look anything like the quality that goes out today due to the massive increase in computation power storage availability etc... So the easiest way for devs to keep the price at  was to start selling DLC that way they could still make some money while also extending development cycles and give players more content.     With the popularity of DLC people were willing to pay a little more for quality DLC to get more out of their game which worked well since the industry was also expanding so more DLC lead to Season Passes which gave you all the DLC for one price. But once again a growing industry costs more to maintain and so it lead to where we are today you still get the base game for  but you wont get most DLC and youll miss out on cosmetic items too but these items take work to produce and so money needs to be paid.    While Im not a huge fan of shelling out  either thats just the way the market works with a growing industry. Companies used to be able to release a game on disk and that was the end of development. But now that development continues often at least a year past release gamers have to pay up because the company is still doing work.,ubisoft,de0cymd,2,t5_2u14q
