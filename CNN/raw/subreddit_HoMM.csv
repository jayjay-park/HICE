1341890,0,t1_ciau44b,See I LOVE the way the units look in  but that may be mostly because Inferno is my favorite and they actually look like what I figured theyd be. In  they were too cartoony and didnt seem menacing but in  thats not the case at all.Another creature related thing I loved was the fact that quite literally every single unit in the game had some sort of special ability be it active or passive. There were no generic this creature exists to hit things with x hp and y damage with nothing else whatsoever that were much more common in the previous ones. They fleshed them out a lot more.Im also a big fan of the fact that the levelups arent random skills anymore Im looking at not getting you logistics for like  levels straight! and you can pick your path.The bloodtears reputations add another dynamic to playstyle and augmenting skills sometimes quite heavily but at the same time it is a bit weird Ill admit and I could easily take it or leave it.I also found in  when you got a good feel for the game could play more tactically than even the previous Heroes games with some of the available abilities on creatures and heroes. There were just more things you could do. Admittedly when I started playing it the game did seem more simple though than ...it took me a while to see it for what it is.That said there are a great deal of things I am not that big a fan of in  compared to the others. The town screen was underwhelming for one. a minor thing but it was satisfying in the other ones... was epic and  was basically awesome animated paintings. Another thing I didnt like was the global recruiting as it essentially makes someone who gets a slight lead in town countdwellings snowball out of control a lot faster. Converting to your own town type was also a mixed bag for me...while convenient and nice it took away some of the strategy of trying to mix and match things run separate armies etc. Ease of access to town portal  the global recruit was also a bit tiresome at times. The zone control system was interesting but didnt care for it all that much and would probably omit it myself as well and last but not least I definitely was not a fan of reducing all the special resources all into crystals...no more sulfurgemsmercury.TLDR  Places I think  excelled hero development unit design in combat strategy. Places I think  was inferior to the others almost everywhere else especially macro strategy.I have a lot of fun with  but I still play  and  for something more solid overall and I can easily see why people wouldnt like it.,HoMM,cikktrm,3,t5_2sm6v
4191613,0,t3_38tlda,This may seem like a stupid idea and I cant remember if it worked to solve my problems or not but try running the game in windowed mode. Its been a while since playing the game but I do remember the blackouts and random crashes. Cant remember how I solved the problem sorry.,HoMM,cry1k1b,3,t5_2sm6v

5317741,0,t3_3nuizh,Thats what I did the other day. Focus everything on gnoll learn No range penalty in offence and let harpies or brutes do the dirty work and the battle is pretty much done. You dont really need champion or elite to win the game  gnolls should get the job done nicely. The same goes with hoplites and eternal servitude or silverback rush. Not sure about sylvan and academy though.,HoMM,cvrejnj,3,t5_2sm6v

7506991,0,t3_4i65ea,Ive heard the Equilibris mod fixes many of the glaring problems with HIV but my childhood memories of the game are not fond ones and Im reluctant to give it another chance. I remember likening it to the Matrix sequels.That said you got me to the point where I wouldve installed and tried Equilibris if I had found my old CDs but alas all I found were the HV CDs  which refuse to install because of their dumb DRM. I guess Im staying with Heroes  of Might and also sometimes Solmyr.,HoMM,d2vi8t8,3,t5_2sm6v

8500791,0,t1_d63uzmm,On one hand I agree with you on the other it can cause an unfun game if youre deliberately abusing flaws in the AI over and over to win. Im not a fan of HoMM never liked that game but have you tried it on the Champion difficulty? They let the AI cheat relentlessly and it was by far the hardest HoMM game where even expert HoMM players had to restart many many times to win it wasnt fun and felt like winning is cheesy. My point is that if the AI cheats it should at least feel like youre playing against an expert player not feel like youre exploiting the AI.,HoMM,d645go9,1,t5_2sm6v
