6082356,0,t1_cyg9r79,Dont shut down the idea. Never.You want to do it invest the time and you can do it man. I settled on the first project being a binary clock I wrote a binary clock in Python which works great in Raspbian. But thats with a display with the OS running Python.But now I want to program it in LEDs. With no electrical experience I found the schematics dont even know if thats the right terminology at indestructibles Im going to do it after all thats what the Raspberry Pi is all about. Learning.Let me know how you get on with the flip disc man Im interested to know and Il let you know how I get one with mine!,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,cygvn1y,1,t5_333hx
6090632,0,t1_cyg9r79,If you have a D printer this could be an option If you dont have a d printer you could probably fabricate the same thing by cutting some old plastic and spray painting it. ,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,cyhxwku,1,t5_333hx
6813929,0,t1_d0omtty,Another idea might be a smartphone app. Most phones have gpsaccelerometer. So instead of horse wearing it the rider would wear it. Could still detect the speed the horse is running jumping. Downside would be couldnt do heartbeat detection or anything like that. Big advantage would be you could create a fall detector. Rider falling off horse is big problem and you could probably? detect that and call for help. Market it as safety device?Seems like a very cool idea. Wish my school had stuff like this when i was in school. Hope the project goes well! ,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,d0onmu4,2,t5_333hx
7089988,0,t1_d1jh7ej,Set it all up on your IP range then set the static IP to what your dads network uses at home and it should work A with that IP provided nothing was assigned to it. Id use like ... as thats generally outside dhcp range.  If not youll just need to reconfigure the server when you get home which will need a keyboard and mouse most likely. Then when you go home open a port on your dads router so you can ssh in and fixupdatebreak stuff.,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,d1k0olv,2,t5_333hx

7257871,0,t3_4et2jz,So Im not completely sure about the MacBook but most laptop screens connect using a ribbon cable you can buy a LVDS converter that will allow you to hook it up to the Hdmi on the pi.  You would also need a way to power the pi the converter and the screen.  A battery to make it portable and an enclosure to house it all.  It would be a cool project but the Pi even the  Is still a little underpowered imho for daily driver use.  It will work for most of your uses email Internet music etc but dont expect great performance or to be doing multitasking very well.   for the pi  for the converter  for the keyboard  for the battery  for WiFi adapter for BT unless youre using the  for a good sized SD card??? For an enclosure It would probably make more sense from a cost standpoint to fix the MacBook or buy something like a chrome book or a used laptop and install lubuntu or xubuntu.  But if youre set on this project look at some other pitops raspberry pi powered laptops to get a good starting point. ,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,d2362hy,1,t5_333hx

8520653,0,t3_4we70b,I have not built one of these but I want to! so please take what Im saying with a grain of salt.Id go with thinner acrylic unless you have a need for additional thickness or your mirror will be large. I do frame a lot of photos with acrylic instead of glass and Ive found that larger sheets are easier to handle if it is thicker but on small scales it doesnt matter much other than cost. A routed edge is shaped. If you want flat edges select no. Radio corners imagine you pick one inch. Draw a dot that is  inch in from each side then cut off the corner to round the edge in a circle that is one inch in radius. A  inch radius corner would have a smaller curve at the corner.

10527067,0,t1_dd1ccvf,Drag and drop works from one file system to another.  dd can do low level writes to block devices. It shouldnt take that long though. Maybe you have a bottleneck somewhere? Slow microsdhc card? Try sending a USR signal to dd or piping dd through the pipe viewer so you can see how fast its going.    kill USR pgrep dd         dd ifimg bsm | pv | dd ofdecmmcblk bsm,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,dd1cvvl,1,t5_333hx

11637072,0,t1_dgf20ie,So youre suggesting he wants an dedicated display for his raspi that is about the size of the raspi or maybe a little bit bigger and he wants it hard mounted to the raspi  but doesnt want to use GPIO pins?  I guess thats an interpretation.I took it as barebones as possible. He says he just wants an HDMI display and since the raspi has an HDMI port you can hook it up to any HDMI display. He seems to insinuate that he is interested in whatever the picture is. I dont really know I guess a touchscreen display shield? I cant tell and I think he linked an image hosted on imgur just to ensure more attention.,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,dgf2pny,4,t5_333hx
11663438,0,t3_66653g,You can try WTware. It turns the Pi into a thin client. With WTware the whole Pi is dedicated as thin client so its not really running a full OS.

11694388,0,t3_66uvwl,It would be neat to build something around this idea of the RPi compute cluster  build the case battery screen keyboard trackpad into a single unit but have the socket in the back  so you can drop in your own upgraded card with new guts. ,RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,dglksb9,1,t5_333hx
