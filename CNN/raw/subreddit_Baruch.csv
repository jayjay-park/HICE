11431015,0,t1_dfro636,I can never justify buying a mac considering most of them cost more then my gaming pc and I would much rather just upgrade more parts. A laptop for taking notes and using the internet should not cost over a thousand. Seems like too much is wasted. I bought a cheap acer aspire r and with an ssd card and it works greatOP u can get Microsoft office on any device if you cant get it legally on a device u can always pirate it on any device. Ofc u can also install windows and get office that way but you do need excel u have excel projects and you may need Microsoft access as well for some classes. U can use school library computers though if you dont have it,Baruch,dfrozaq,2,t5_2spee

Sometimes you cant register for something not only because of prerequisites andor intended major but also because of number of credits you must have completed. ,Baruch,dgogbt6,1,t5_2spee
