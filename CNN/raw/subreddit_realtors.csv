602768,0,t1_cg8inml,No problem glad to help. Youre correct that the process is a bit different as youll actually have to be marketing yourself to different teams instead of essentially showing up to a brokerage and being hired without hesitation. Determining the right team to work for was a bit tough but from my experience I think there are several key things to look for. First of all personality is a huge factor...does the teams way of communicating mesh with yours? Age can really play into this as well as I preferred to work with a younger team that utilized a lot of technology. AdditionallyI wanted to work with a team near the top of the market as there will always be something new to learn.   ,realtors,cg8sdrt,1,t5_2soln

3741239,0,t1_cqinz6h,I believe they have to be inperson but if that has changed then great.  I couldnt say for sure.  Here is what I would do if I was serious about it in your position.  Do you see a bunch of yard signs for one particular person or a couple of people?  They are successful and probably busy.  I would call their line personally introduce yourself and ask if they need any help.  Probably better to do this while you are already taking classes so they see you are clearly going to follow through.  If you get on board with a successful team you will be in a great spot.  If you want to start out on your own just call the brokerages around everyone wants new blood and basically interview them to see if they can help in your career.  You are doing the interviewing in that case because you are a commodity that brokers want.  But I suggest in person meetings if ever possible  it shows you are more serious.  ,realtors,cqiq51g,1,t5_2soln

Real estate has been crazy lately so things have been selling fast but in a normal market taking your home off the active listings for a period of time could be a missed opportunity to resell the house if you back out.

9503218,0,t3_5ay55j,Its a tough decision thats for sure.To start maybe think about whether you want to be part of a brokerage thats affiliated with a big brand  like Keller Williams REMAX or whatever big brands are up in Canada.  Theyre a lot different from independent brokerages... theres typically more fees but also more benefits.  If you take advantage of the benefits high profile marketing free online training free tools for finding and retaining business etc especially as a new agent the benefits typically outweigh the fees in my opinion.The next decision you should think about is whether you want to join a brokerage as an individual agent or join a team of agents within a brokerage.  Each team and broker is different  its easy to say that most brokerages are operated like this or most teams work like this but the truth is that I know several of each that go against the norm.  The pros and cons will be different for every brokerageteam you consider working with but in general I would think a new agent might benefit from being part of a team because youll have some experienced agents to lean on ask questions and help share the general load on things that slow down new agents like contracts and showing buyers  houses lol.The biggest things with these two decisions are experience level and commission split.  The agents who I know that do very well as independent agents at a boutique or momandpop brokerage have years of experience and have built a huge book of clients and past clients to draw business from.  Most new agents that I know choose to start out with a major brand to help with their marketing and training and many of them start with a team so they can learn the ropes for a few years before going on their own so they can keep more of their commissions.  Its all a game of pros and cons give and take.  You just have to find what fits you best and remember that what fits you best NOW might not be what fits you best in  years  years or  years.The most important part of your decision really has to do with the people youll be working with.  Whether youre independent or teamed up brand name brokerage or not the PEOPLE are the biggest factor.  You want to make sure that you jive with them like their business philosophy and trust them.As far as what the actual process looks like some brokerages are always recruiting.  Some brokerages will take almost anyone with a license WHY??  Because some brokers make money off your monthly fees not what business you close and some brokerages only want the cream of the crop.  Some brokerages will offer trainingshadowing some wont.  Some have great perks some dont.  Some require floor time and attendance at frequent meetings some dont.

10673052,0,t3_5sp0cm,You definitely need a website no question!  It sounds like the more important questions for you are WHAT do you want to put into a website and what are you hoping to get out of it?In my opinion although every agent needs a website not every agent needs some extremelyexpensiveeverybellandwhistleearthshattering website.  You have to decide what your needs are for a website and let that determine what you should spend.  And some things are scalable meaning you can start small and inexpensive and add bigger and better things later.  Keeping in mind that this is just my two cents heres a breakdown of the different levels of website offerings along with their pros and cons Just the Brand.  If youre with one of the major brands Remax Keller Williams Coldwell Banker etc. then youre probably provided a website like this for free and it may even allow you to make adjustments and edits to it so that it can suit you better.  If its provided for you by one of the big brands it probably has a way for site visitors to search the MLS on it which is great!  This allows you to have a professional online image at little or no cost.PROS   You have a website.   People can use your website to find your contact info.   People can use your website to search the MLS.   Little or no upfront cost.CONS   Your website isnt doing much to help you stand out from your competitors.   Your website is a template site meaning its extremely difficult for it to be optimized for search engines so you cant be easily found on Google.   Your website lacks personality and personalization options so it is almost identical to every other agent from your brandcompany.   If you want to change brandsbrokerages you probably cant take your website with you.   You usually cant add extras to your site like blogs custom contact forms special lead generation options etc. Package Deals.  What I call package deals are companies that offer you a website as a part of an overall offering.  For example if youre spending advertising dollars with Zillow then they offer you a template website for  per month.  As another example Placesters lowest website package includes a lead managementCRM system and the whole bundle is  per month.  They also offer a  per month package that includes additional offerings.  These websites look great function well and are pretty customizable in terms of appearance.  If youre wanting to just do the bare minimum website and dont have a big brand to give you a free website these are your best bet.PROS   You have a website.   People can use your website to find your contact info.   People can use your website to search the MLS.   You can have a blog and some other website features.   Reasonable monthly costs and little or no upfront cost.CONS   Your website is a template site meaning its extremely difficult for it to be optimized for search engines so you cant be easily found on Google.   Youre extremely limited in terms of thirdparty providers because you basically have to use whichever platforms and CRMs that the website provides for you or is already integrated with.   Scalability is difficult because the features extensions and integrations of template sites are extremely limited.   Even if you put a lot of great content on your site and in your blog it may not be found or read very often because of the optimization limitations of template sites.   You dont own the site the company youre paying monthly owns it which means that any changes and decisions they make in the future could affect your site substantially.   Youll be paying those monthly costs as a part of your marketing budget FOREVER like renting a house instead of buying one. Your Own WordPress Site.  If you dont want ANY limitations or restrictions on your websites design structure abilities or integrations then you should strongly consider hiring someone with experience building real estate websites to build you a WordPress site.  This is the best longterm solution for your business because its endlessly scalable and  owned by you.  That means if your business model pivots slightly in the future lets say you start targeting relocation clients rather than firsttime homebuyers or maybe you just want to switch your brand or brokerage youre able to change your website quickly and easily.  It also means that you can use whichever CRM and other softwares you please and you can change them as often as you want.  Having a WordPress site built can cost anywhere from  to .  In general I would stay away from anything that costs less than  as such low prices are typically reserved for overseas labor which proves to be a bad decision  of the time.  Id also steer clear of anything that costs more than  unless you have some very specific needs that justify extra costs.  Depending on what features and functionality you want the monthly costs can range from  per month to  per month.PROS  You have a website.   People can use your website to find your contact info.   People can use your website to search the MLS.   You can have as many features as you want like a blog custom contact forms mortgage calculators embedded videos participation from your lenders scheduling that automatically works with your existing calendar automated email campaigns and so much more.  The options are truly endless.   The lowest monthly costs available because youre directly paying vendors that you can pick and choose if you want so you can switch vendors if youre unhappy with the service or product youre being provided.   Maximum potential for search engine optimization meaning your site can be searched for and found on Google and other search engines.   You own your site so it will always be yours no matter what future course your business takes it can even be SOLD if you retire or decide to switch industries!   You can make any changes you want anytime you want you dont have to pay your website company to make changes for you.  WordPress is easy to use and there are countless WordPress howto and DIY videos online.  But if you choose to outsource it finding a provider you like will be easy because WordPress is the  website platform in the world.   You can start out with the bare minimum website to make it financially feasible for you and add on more later.CONS   The upfront cost is typically higher than it is for template sites because youre paying someone to take the time to build you something that fits your needs rather than putting your name and contact info on top of a preexisting template.   Choosing your vendersservice providers can be tough.  If you hire one of the bigger companies to work with you youll likely overpay because of their high overhead.  Then again if you hire a sketchy person who is inexpensive and doesnt have any references or proof of experience youre likely to get sketchy results.  Find a knowledgable and experienced small company with low overhead.I know thats a lot to consider!  To help you make your decision ask yourself what your current goals are what your longterm goals are and what kind of business youre wanting to build.  Where do you see the majority of your leads coming from?  I know agents who are the types that know everybody in town and havent had to pay for marketing in  years!  For them the bare minimum website is all they need.  But if youre hoping to capitalize on internet marketing at all now or in the future you might want to consider a WordPress site.If you have any questions or want more information or clarification please ask!

11019467,0,t3_5xafgo,I can go get a HUD foreclosure for  or an updated well taken care of mansion for .  Both are houses why would I ever pick anything other than the  foreclosure?It is becoming more and more of a trend in the industry to cut commission offer rebates or do whatever discounts you can to entice business.  In the end though you need to justify your fees and services both to yourself and your client.  You should be able to articulate the work that you are doing both with the client and behind the scenes that justify your fees.  If you can do that youll find many objections are easily removed and those that still want to pay you bottom dollar probably werent worth your time anyway.You have to decide what kind of agent you want to be.  A high volume low service low fee agent or a high service lower volume and more standard fee agent.  ,realtors,deh0y09,1,t5_2soln
11129543,0,t1_deotqse,The first office I was in had  or  teams two were both actively accepting agents each month but they were somewhat new teams. I actually changed firms because a team recruited me. The firm I am with is all team based ish agents across ish teams. Id say just start putting out feelers. Over here there are tons of postings on CL and other jobs boards for buyers agents. Youll end up doing more leg work usually for a lower percentage  but my thought is  of  deals a month is more than  of  deals! ,realtors,detivff,1,t5_2soln

11566932,0,t3_65313v,Communication is huge. If they can meet you immediately or have a wide open calendar thats a red flag. Get recommendations from friends and coworkers. See who has listings in the neighborhoods you are interested in. Dont be afraid to fire an agent if you dont jive with them. We pay way too many ducky agents just because we dont want to hurt feelings. I have an office of  agents and would personally feel comfortable with using maybe  of them...,realtors,dg74868,3,t5_2soln
11601865,0,t1_dgb2rfb,Where do they come in? Apparently both the listing broker and my agent have had years worth of short sale experiences they claim to have good contacts in Wells Fargo so hopefully that helps. I was just told that the short sale has been approved already just not the price as of yet. ,realtors,dgb2wo2,1,t5_2soln
