6811079,0,t3_3kkkx7,Will this effect my car insurance?btw if this makes any difference whatsoever I live in the UK So Im soon to be a new driver and insurance for new drivers at the moment is really expensive! Im aware of that! But my question was this basically Im looking to buy my first car but the car Im looking to buy was involved in an accident with not the current owner but the owner before that! And I dont quite fully understand this but the accident was apparently a Category D accident? So what I was wondering was as this car has been in an accident but is now repaired even though it wasnt me who had the accident will this effect the price of my car insurance as the car I will be driving will have been involved in an accident before but not involving myself? Thanks guys  xx,skypuppet,d0obzuf,1,t5_2y27w
