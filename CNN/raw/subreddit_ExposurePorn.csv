7194816,0,t1_d1v58t0,Thanks! I froze my ass off and was feeling kind of oxygen deprived by the time I was done but it was worth it. The snow was a tough call. White balance in panoramas is often a pain in the ass. A global correction made everything far too yellow.  I could have gone in and masked out the bluish parts and corrected them but after looking at it for a while I realized that the reason that some of the snow was OK and some was kinda blue was that the blueish snow was reflecting the blue in the night sky and the more white snow was reflecting the comparatively whiter clouds. So I decided to not mask out the blue parts and just leave it as you see it cuz weird things happen at  ISO and between that and the moving clouds stray light changing angle of the moon etc that was what the photo wanted to look like. I know that makes me sound like high or something but its more like my photoshop skills arent up to doing this in a way that is convincing when printed at  x . ,ExposurePorn,d1vzpcd,1,t5_2tlvh

Wouldnt then the ground move relative to the camera?Edit Nevermind I found a video explaining how the tracker works and the guy said that the ground blur is negligible.

11191284,0,t1_df0hsdk,If youre referring to FL the road which runs around the cruise terminals and into the main south gate at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station the answer is usually yes.  I can only think of one time in the last few years when theyve been closed and that was during the firstever land landing of a Falcon  rocket.  Cape security forces closed the road just in front of the entrance to the north side of the Port.The USAF even has bleachers set up in front of their Missile History Center for launch viewing and for the upcoming Delta IV launch Saturday evening that will be the closest public viewing location to SLCB Delta IVs launchpad.,ExposurePorn,df0iosj,1,t5_2tlvh
