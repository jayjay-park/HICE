6010685,0,t1_cxh24wx,Not many small mods to do. Maybe wheels and such but would be sweet to see a Reno build lol. I dont even have a cav anymore. I made this sub awhile back and am amazed anyone uses it. I try to help out the best I can. I have a civic si sx and a eclipse now. Miss my cav tho. ,Chevycavalier,cy7j4o8,1,t5_2wz69
6726305,0,t1_d0etoou,Yeah I guess I didnt give many details. I left it at my parents house and moved  hours away so I cant really check the specific issues. My mechanical ability would best be described as beginner. I mean Ive completely taken apart and reassembled a hp Honda engine with no issues but thats about it. I see this carproject as a way to learn my way around an engine and how to findfix problems with one. If I completely fuck it up and render it useless Ill cut my losses and haul it to a scrap yard. ,Chevycavalier,d0f249u,2,t5_2wz69
9811198,0,t1_damf2hr,Nice. Thats in VERY good condition compared to mine lol.
