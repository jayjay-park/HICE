19584,0,t1_cegnig5,gt Likewise no one is claiming that civilians are not being killed only that the result is still better overall even for civilians than what we would have been doing to protect deployed troops instead in  and earlier.True however the point remains that the results are skewed by the habit of declaring those caught in the blast to be enemy combatants simply because they were of a certain age and in the area. The proper way to minimize civilian casualties is not to lie about it. That only breeds more resentment which makes every successful strike a net loss in terms of security.gt Yes how noble of you. Since you cant point a finger at the  people who will die when you cut foreign aid that magically makes it more ethical. POr perhaps I meant that one is a passive thing while the other is active.

44568,0,t3_1ulrcz,It seems like on the one hand you recognize that the frequency and volume of your intake is highrisk territory and on the other that youre keeping it under control.Its easy to get into a mindset where you say Im drinking for stress relief. It helps me manage a demanding lifestyle. To some extent it might be true but its very difficult to see the transition occur when youre succeeding or getting by in spite of your drinking not because of any relaxation benefit it might incur. People have trouble going to work in the morning and saying Hey maybe Im stressed out because Im killing a sixpack every night. Its very easy to assign unidirectional causality usually it goes both ways.With the military transitioning away from sustained combat operations peoples garrison behavior will come under more and more scrutiny. It only takes one missed formation to get a lot of undesirable attention.You want to have either slowed it down yourself or sought help of your own volition before things get to that point. Some people manage highvolume intake for a long time without seeming to ever let it get on top of them for others its an inherently progressive process. Youll have to judge for yourself how serious it is but the fact that youre posting about it indicates youve got some concerns. Try phasing out or cutting back on the weeknight drinking and see if your onduty stress level improves high levels of workplace stress can be a symptom of among other things getting insufficient or poor quality sleep because alcohol interferes with your normal sleep patterns.Had you been drinking when you posted this?,Military,ceji75n,6,t5_2qh8y

Do you know what happens when a SEAL doesnt become a SEAL but still has time left on his contract? I know some really strong and badasses not get in.

After reading No Easy Day I would assume that you will be heard and blown to bits if you are not miles away from the drop. I think they drop you about  miles out and you gotta trek it after that. You get to choose your standard weapons especially the secondary. Sometimes you dont get to choose. Airsoft aint going to do shit. To pass bootcamp what everyone worries about is the . miles in  minutes or something to that extend depending on age. Try running  miles a day.

If an officer got caught in a similar situation there could be hell to pay or it could be nothing at all.If a unit is placed on QRB nobody has freedom and the officer will be expected to enforce that.

Yeah you might be able to identify friendly forces through markings or strobesonly at night but that grid you just received gets punched into the targeting system. You hit the release point and the bomb is out of your control. Unless it was a laser guided GBU which I doubt. They are a tool used by the forces on the ground. Its both the controllers job and the pilots possibly gunner depending on the platform to make sure the coordinates are read back and correct especially when dropping munitions. Usually there is a direction of approach and you want to minimize the chances of troops getting friendly fire so you direct the fires away from them. Say the target is m to the west of the friendly FLT the pilot would want to drop it from an azimuth that if the GBU malfunctioned it would bounce or miss its target it wouldnt be headed towards friendlies. So North to South or East to West would be the pilots approach. ,Military,cfidvom,2,t5_2qh8y

Theres been some speculation online that the flames come from some sort of gas thats been used to increase conductivity. Wrong The EMRG uses no secondary propellant  just electricity. As a result the breech can remain open during firing and the gun produces no blowback whatsoever. In fact the researchers sometimes place cameras and mirrors inside the breech during tests to get a better sense of whats going on.Now whether or not you trust a basic scientific explanation of a brand new and extremely powerful combat technology coming from the Office of Naval Research is another issue entirely but I am not a physicist and havent the slightest idea of what else might be causing that fireball.

By the time we split off wed been treated as a separate but equal entity within the Army as is the Corps within the Navy. There was once pride in being Air Force and they made certain it was visible with our rank and insignia. Keeping the old rank structure would have made it way too easy for us to get confused for them and just as yall dont enjoy being referred to as Soldier because you ALSO happen to be a USAUSMC SHARED RANK GOES HERE we didnt want that to keep happening. However it did for a while since we kept their uniforms ranks and titles until  when we became Airmen from Soldiers and early  when we changed from Armys rank and title system to our own title system new insignia were adopted in late early . Ever since I think weve managed to add drop or change something every decade through the s. Personally I like our own system but prefer how it was a while back.

997111,0,t1_chhb9y8,I theorize that after the war Palpatine reformed military spending and instead of supplying the military with proper weaponsarmorvehicles ended up spending most of the money on experimental projects.  The Death Stars  and  being examples of an overbudgeted space station that was more suited for a conventional but outdated Clone War model rather than the Rebel Counterinsurgency being conducted near the end of Palpatines reign.In fact the general technology and training during the Clone Wars was much more advanced than during the Emperors reign.  The Emperor ended up sellingreplacing the standard issue weaponsarmorvehicles with lower quality ones in order to fund his Death Stars.During his reign Palpatine also took up another huge chunk of the military budget and spent it on a galactic healthcare reform.  While he introduced advanced bactatechnology he was also responsible for investing in cybernetic implants such as robotic arms torsos legs etc.  This would be met with criticism as lightsabers were an outdated useless tool and blasters scorched the body rather than tore through it.  Though its likely Palpatine funded this on Darth Vaders behalf.Unfortunately these costly reforms sent the Empire into a galacticwide depression.  In an effort to repair the damage done by the war citizens had to settle for less technological luxuries as they had been accustomed to before Palpatines reign.This is why the architecture technology and weaponry sucked during Emperors reign.  And this is the primary reason that I feel garnered sympathy for the Rebellion.Rather than the whitewashing history that the Rebels mostly fought to free oppressed nonhumans it was more about economical instability and the overthrowing one of the worst most incompetent rulers in Republic history.,Military,chhmnc0,27,t5_2qh8y

A somewhat confused hero begrudgingly agrees but ask out loud how in the world do you work with a nuclear warhead.

1133723,0,t3_273tjz,From a general broad standpoint you have US officials in this case most likely John Kerry communicating our interests with a rd party member in this case Qatar. So we tell Qatar that we have this POW in Afghanistan and its a political nightmare and it would benefit our administration that we get him home. Qatar will essentially broker and negotiate this trade with the Taliban officials they know theres a Taliban embassy in Qatar yes the Taliban is a legitimate enough organization to have an embassy. Basically Qatar will go back and forth between the US and the Taliban brokering this deal until we find a middle ground that we are both okay with and a deal can be reached. Of course this is much simpler sounding than it actually is especially when the group you are negotiating with doesnt have to live up to the same standards you do. Now Ive never brokered an international hostage exchange before but this is my understanding of how these deals are structured. ,Military,chx5j9s,10,t5_2qh8y

1139494,0,t3_275rat,If I were a cold blooded realist born with no soul like...Oh I dont know... lets go with a Carl Rove type. Trading Guantanamo dudes for this guy would be a win win for me. Gitmo whether any of you want to believe this or not is a ginormous goat fuck for the US.First lots of people in the US are not to happy that these guys have not had any type of due process or hearings and have been left to rot for a long time. This is especially true if you are a Democrat who voted for a guy who promised to change all that and hasnt really done a whole lot about it the past few years. Obama has his hands tied on this one though. Sorry Barry. I didnt vote for you but I feels your pains. Second this shit has fucked up our ability to hold any type of leverage over other countries that dabble in shady detainment centers for political dissenters. North Korea comes to mind.  Last it really is nothing more than another recruiting tool for organizations that hate the west. Those fuckers sitting in there arent evil fucking geniuses. They are just motivated assholes solving a lot of small problems to complete a larger plan. We all diddo the same shit. The whole shebang didnt stop because they were carted away. They were replaced by other small problem solving assholes and the ball kept on a rolling. So what the fuck do you do with them? Do you execute them with out some form of  due process? Not without pissing off a lot of citizen and giving countries like NK more fodder for the cannons.Do you give them a trial and run the risk of having to release them because there is not enough evidence? I mean they could rig the trial but there would be a lot of attention on that shit and any foul play would be hard to cover up I mean this aint the NBA Just let them go? Well now you piss off a whole other set of peoples and even some of your own.Or do you doll out a few here and there to retrieve an American Solider who may or may not be a POW? Fuck yes you do! You have a legitimate reason to unload some fuckers back into Dronemansland and possibly blow them the fuck up at the first given opportunity with impunity! Oh god damn it is fucking diabolically beautiful. Sure you are running the risk of losing them along the way but that is a calculated risk.  You also get your hands on Bergdahl. Who has been hanging out with the Talibs for a few years. It is unlikely that he will give over any intelligence to the US but it is possible. Whatever the Gitmo detainees had to offer up is long since irrelevant or they are never going to crack. So I can see a logical reason behind this although I honestly have no idea if this is the reason for the trade but it is a crazy world out there. Good luck team O.

1232456,0,t1_ci844sd,You have to understand the cold war mentality of the military. Before the mid s or so real combat experience was vanishingly rare a before Desert Storm even seeing someone with a combat patch was a rare thing usually limited to senior officers and NCOs. The only time we were in possession of live ammo was under extremely tightly controlled conditions on range day. As a result the vast overwhelming majority of the Army never had a reasonable expectation of pulling the trigger for real so it was never even thought of to make trigger discipline a universal thing. Nobody ever had live ammo except when they were being hovered over by three sergeants and forced to keep the weapon pointed downrange so what point was there in enforcing finger off the trigger? In fact when I went through basic the first time in  during our down time in the field our drill sergeant would have us get prone and practice dryfire at the platoon on the other side of the road and they were doing the same to us. Then the second time I went through in  it was all finger of the trigger. ,Military,ci89o7y,13,t5_2qh8y

If I were you I would also take an EMT class and get some experience in an ER or any medical experience. Talk to a prehealth advisor read up on premed stuff online. If being a military officer that practices medicine is still what you want when its time to apply you have the option to go to the uniformed services university or take an active duty scholarship.

1364510,0,t3_29pcyr, People are hardwired to learn languages. If you were dumped in the middle of some isolated group speaking a language youd never even heard of you would learn some version of it but it could be that you would systematically mess up some communications because of not getting adequate directioncorrection. Its bad enough if you want facial tissues and you ask for sanitary pads. To do something like that would be embarrassing but it probably wouldnt endanger anybody. If you make mistakes of syntax or vocabulary or unintentionally say something or ask something that is a cultural offense then in a military situation it might mean major bad news. I remember one Army Language School graduate telling me about the American who confused your subordinates with your private parts in communicating with somebody in authority in the army of another country.The best thing then is to be in a social situation wherein you get your favorite dish if you can name it in the other guys language or else you get todays blue plate special. Or in one textbook I used the guy goes into a restaurant and tries to get an umbrella and gestures etc. As a result the waiter brings him an order of mushrooms. In that situation you will also need a competent language teacher preferably onetoone for an hour a day five days a week. One thing in addition to drilling that the teacher can do is to correct your pronunciation. Another thing the teacher will do is to get you to use correct grammar. A minimum requirement is that you do not fail to communicate accurately. It will help if you dont sound like a hick. The above two factors are mutually reinforcing and you get terrific acceleration as a result.You would also benefit from hanging out with their military people as soon as you can manage it. For the sake of your own clear outgoing communications for  clear incoming communication but also for intelligence that may come to you between the lines if you understand the language well enough you need to learn the lingo. In certain situations you can learn a lot just by sitting quietly and let conversations blossom around you. You should be happy if they figure youre a dumb American who couldnt possibly understand their slang or argot.,Military,cinbx28,0,t5_2qh8y

I thought I was better than them.Then came the race my buddy was a broke dick runner who slowed me down. He also had to bring a huge gay ass . tacticool backpack or whatever the fuck it was.

Ive narrowed it down to the Navy and the Coast Guard so far and Im hoping to get into OCS. I have a college degree and had excellent grades but in liberal arts history and politics double major to be precise. A few questions I have right now are which branch will I be more likely to be accepted into OCS for the Navy or the Coast Guard? How does quality of life differ between the Navy and the Coast Guard for things like meals camaraderie baseship living conditions etc.? Should I prefer one service even if with the other I have a higher likelihood of being commissioned example is enlisted Coast Guard life better than commissioned Navy life and vice versa? Finally though its a bit early to make this decision given I havent even gotten in either service yet but is there a difference in how people are perceived and treated for those planning to make this a longterm career versus those only planning on staying in the service for one term of enlistment?I know theres a lot of questions in that for one comment so if anyone wants to answer just one or two of these Id be really grateful!,Military,cja28vp,1,t5_2qh8y

I got in contact through the suicide prevention hotline although I wasnt planning on killing myself and I just needed someone to talk to with a local vet center. The vet center offers consoling free of charge to vets and does not share their information with anyone VA included unless there is an immediate threat of suicide.

They tell them that  will be nothing once they are famous. Once they sign on they ship then to Korea and make them prostitutes excuse me entertainers. Somehow Koreans do not consider it prostitution because they do not give the girls money for sex.

Looking back we should have just shot them on site which was within ROE at the time in that area but you know professional army..blah blah.  Also this was  weeks to the day that we took over the sector so we werent totally familiar with where we couldshould drive or not.Anyway we got a call from brigade telling us to take these fools to their houses and search the place inside out.  The way out there was sketchy as fuck craters that we thought were from the air but turns out they were old IEDs since this was Jan .  Sketchy people giving us the stink eye the whole way and really rural a little bit south of Baghdad.We get to the first place and I stay with the drivers and our  gunnerI was the medic at the trucks keeping tabs on the growing crowd about yd down the road...no children around fuck always a shitty feeling.  The rest of the platoon comes back found some wire and detcord but nothing major enough to bring the to the DIF or whatever it was called should have went right then.Get to the second house same deal. But this time I dont feel so hot.  I dont know if it was the stress from the situation or just an unlucky coincidence.  Either way this turd was coming whether I wanted it to or not.  The gunners give me a look out and there was no one we could see so I went over to this tree in someones front yard nearby and our . had clear line of site to me so I let fly.  This was the strangest colored largest pile of shit I have ever seen to this day.  My guts are simultaneously screaming for mercy and crying with relief. FUCK! In my haste I forgot to grab napkins out of the MREs.  Im stranded pants around my ankles leaning against a tree with my M in one hand and panic on my face.  My gunner is laughing so hard hes crying trying to call the rest of the platoon to let them know how ridiculous this is.  Then I hear in his ridiculously Jeff Foxworthy accent Hey Doc! Wipe your ass with that chicken!.  A random chicken wandered by.  I was like fuck it and made a play at the chicken.  Obviously I didnt catch it and I see ol  Cal with his camera out.

They had been watching dudes and trucks go up and down there quite a bit but the turks were not engaging them directly so ISIS figured they were probably safe to stick a flag and hang out up there.Heres a link to part  of the VICE series on Kobane theyre pretty interesting,Military,cljlh3i,6,t5_2qh8y

I talked to many different people that all told me its rare  and some said its not possible. One of the biggest issues they have is you have to be non deployable for atleast  years. If you get your CO to sign off on that then you go into orthodontics for a consultation. Generally due to the small size of orthodontics deparments in the military they will review your case along with other entrys and will pick the worst cases out of the bunch people with the worst teeth. After that I think I had to get another final sign off with the CO. Im pretty sure they wont do outpatient. They made sure to tell me they wanted to get my braces off before my EAS so I wouldnt have to. Hope this helps but unless you reenlist I dont think you will be able to.

2363993,0,t3_2md1v5,Lets see...Idea Streetfighter attempt . Attempt  was of course the LCS. Take a Flyvefisken bump it from  to  meters which should about double the tonnage to . Use the extra space to Maintain the fiberglass hull. Its extremely cheap lightweight and surprisingly durable. Mount a tactical  cell VLS amidships in the superstructure. Even a cell Tomahawk is pushing things but a cell quadpack SM should fit although it could do nasty things to the metacentric height when the ship is low on fuel. A cell strategic offers more mission capabilities than even a cell tactical if it will fit but isnt worth compromising stability. Requires lots of careful math to be sure. The hull can take an OTO Melara mm Strales on the foredeck without any problem which will give  km gun range using Vulcano. mmin would be nice but the mm gives very good antiairmissile protection and launching a .x as heavy shell at  rpm via the mm is almost certainly too much for the hull. Bump the rear deck line of three Stanflex modules to a pack. Check out what the Danish were mounting in those things in the s! Try to bump the foredeck from a single to a double Stanflex. Stop if its compromising anything. Add both the RIM Mk pack launcher and the pack SeaRAM launcher with builtin radarfirecontrol to the list of Stanflex options. Both are perfectly sized to fit. Likewise update the MU torpedoes to Mk . Again perfect fit. Since youre mounting an SM and possibly Mk beef up the electronics to match. Much higher scan resolution and power versions are available today for a relatively modest tonnage increase. You cant get into AEGIS territory for less than  tons so dont try. Take a cargo Stanflex module turn it into a . cubic meter fuel blivet to extend ship endurance dramatically for Pacific theater operations especially when multiple modules are used. Explore possibility of creating doublesized  ton capable Stanflex module for future use and more capable systems. The Streetfighter II could theoretically mount  of these. If costs start ballooning shut it down hard. Create a light helicopter  pound capable landing platform with popup convertible style hanger and integrated fuel blivets. Would be a set of  Stanflex modules in a suite replacing the aft deck modules. Munitions and large common replacement stores can also be stored in popup racks within the Stanflex modules. Explore whether the  module option will allow supporting two Fire Scouts it should be possible but may be too cramped for landing. SeahawkLAMPS III wont fit in a hanger even if it could somehow land so dont try it.End result? A  ton ship that performs the same mission set as the LCS similar sensors a proven quickswap modular system that actually works equivalent range or significantly greater with fuel modules and both offensive and defensive firepower thats embarrassingly better. SM Strales and SeaRAM on a  ton decoythrowing fiberglass ship is a tough nut to crack. Downside is much less unallocated hull volume no huge dedicated flight deck and speeds more in line with traditional light warships. Cost would be  million depending on VLS options electronics fit and production run size.,Military,cm3wdzv,2,t5_2qh8y

M can be a risky choice theyre probably the most likely of the series to leave the wire but in garrison Army they dont get to do much.If youre going the officer route youll have to commission and branch intelligence which is fairly competitive and not guaranteed.If you want to work with intelligence and have a degree your best option is to apply directly to intelligence agencies.,Military,cmo492c,9,t5_2qh8y

Flight line security? An MP can watch people break red just as well a SF. Unless you actually fly or work on an aircraft every other job in the AF can be replaced by somebody in the Army. The USMC is a beachhead securing force highly mobile and quick reaction force. Yet they were fighting hundreds of miles inland in Iraq and Afghanistan is fucking landlocked.

2774239,0,t1_cnixhzc,Im prior enlisted at USMA and Im inclined to agree a lot of the kids here really are being incredibly sheltered by the walls of the academy. I went to college before I enlisted so I can kind of compare all three routes my old school had ROTC but I did not partake and USMA definitely better prepares on the military side but as an active duty soldier the only way I was able to pick West Pointers out was their tendency to be a tad socially awkward. Obviously not all of them were but there was a definite trend. Now as a cadet I dont really mind being boxed up on campus I feel like Ive already had my fun but I do tend to think the younger direct admits are really missing out on some development. Ive been asked how to talk to girls on more than one occasion which you know isnt a big deal as they are  year olds but there are other smaller things that kind of hint where theyll be socially by the time they graduate and commission. ,Military,cnjf50x,2,t5_2qh8y

There are ways to detect these devices including a simple android app. I believe no one is disputing their existence and use anymore because theyve been seen in public.Why would police want this device? Well as you say you can get a wiretap... If a judge signs off on it. You dont have to do that with this device since the police themselves operate it. As I said police are using them without obtaining warrants. Personally I believe it is illegal to use without a warrant but because the evidence obtained has been kept out of courtrooms so far no judge has gotten to weigh in on it. The police seem to be using it for surveillance and then using parallel construction to keep the scanner it self out of court rooms.

This is relatively straightforward over solid ground or high enough in a relatively consistent medium like atmosphere.   When you hit the phase shift where the air meets water the abrupt surfacetension gradient can mess shit up which with single rotor helos or a lessskilled aviator can manifest in unfortunate ways like the water rapidly displacing compromising the gas compression cone which is likely to result in catastrophic lift decrease helo goes for a swim.  Im not really sure how the chinook manages to do this but Ive been told its a factor both of the dual rotors and the ratio of the rotor length to the weight amp depth of the airframe eg more operational airfoil area higher above the water surface to dissipate the thrust without conducting enough kinesis into the water at any single point to cause displacement.tldr thats some badass flyboy shit right there.,Military,co9849x,9,t5_2qh8y

The bore riding pin will pop out when the mortar leaves the tube since the bore is whats holding it in place. The explosive train is usually aligned by the acceleration of getting launched out of the tube. And if i saw the round fly any distance out the tube Id assume it got enough acceleration to arm and Id high tail it out of there. ,Military,cp0lnqu,-1,t5_2qh8y

3284384,0,t1_coyfey6,This post is pretty much spot on.... mostly.FWIW there is no AWOL anymore and not in the USAR.Corrected AWOL is not used the in the USAR for missing drills also know as Military Unit Training Assemblies MUTAs or simply UTAs aka the title  status weekend duty we normally associate with Reserve and Guard.NoteIn the USAR if you miss a drill without prior approval or without a legitimate reason legitimate as determined by your CDR then you get marked down on the signin roster pay sheet with the code U and that is put into the pay system.  If you miss  UTAs in a one year period then your commander can choose to run a separation packet on you up the chain. If they process this and you get kicked out this is called being Ued Out. Note Separation packets have to go pretty high up the chain and have to be approved at each level or are kicked back for some very trivial administrivia. The process takes a long time shortest one Ive seen was  months.This combined with the fact that the retention numbers in the USAR are really really bad means the packets are often kicked back and the unit has a noshowunsat soldier on their books which brings down the units metrics.Note  unauthorized absence UA is used in the Navy Marine Corps and Coast Guard absent without leave AWOL is used in the Army and Air Force. For Army Guard or Reserve AWOL would apply if you fail to report for orders putting you on active duty status i.e. Mobilization orders putting you in Title  status.

3374354,0,t1_cpcm73b,Ah your questions are excellent!. The wash youre talking about is an issue to an extent but the KC has a milder wash than say a KC which is a much much bigger air frame. Receiver pilots talk about this usually only when referencing how much more difficult the KC is in some situations. In most situations the wash is not terrible because the engines are on the wings and not blowing directly onto the receiver who is centered on the tanker and is lower below the tanker rather than directly behind. Heres an image to help show what Im talking aboutAnother issue that is similar is referred to as bow wave like what you would imagine a big boat pushing water would look like except with air and all over. This is an affect noticed mostly on big receivers like the C or C. This bow wave actually pushes the tanker around when near contact and causes Hell on our crappy autopilot when the receiver suddenly drops away from us.. No there are no physical protections from putting a nozzle through the receivers windshield. The only protection they have is training for the boom operator and the pilots. I once got to ride on a receiver aircraft and when that boom passed in front of the windshield I about shit a brick. The noise increases from aerodynamic forces and theres a big clunk sound when the boom seats in the receptacle. Heres a vid I found with a B refueling off a . The contact is made about the  mark. For reference the receptacle is only  inches from the windshield and the windshield gets foggy from fuel spray.. This is called a breakaway. The procedure happens at about .This procedure helps prevent damage to both the aircraft. I couldnt find pictures of a sheared boom nozzle or damaged boom but there is something we call unicorning. Its essentially what happens when everything has gone wrong and weve ripped off the boom or nozzle and the receiver still have a piece attached to their airframe. Bad day all around. Heres a video of something horrible ALMOST happening while refueling.. Fuel igniting is highly unlikely. Jet A needs to be compressed to burnwell you can set it on fire in the traditional manner but a burning match can be put out in the stuff. The biggest concern with damage to the aircraft is being able to maintain your aerodynamics. For instance if you have fuel going from the front of your aircraft to the back it becomes incredibly hard to balance the aircraft you need more thrust to stay airborne start losing speed which means less airflow over your wings which means less lift which means you start stalling which means you fall towards the earth ass first and die horriblyand quickly. Heres a video of what I mean. Warning Terrifying to me.Heres one where a helicopter shears off their own probeprobe and drogue refueling is a different type of refueling employed by NATO and the Navy.Most refuelable aircraft in the military use similar jet fuels like JP and Jet A. JP was a military fuel used for many years designed for the military. Recently the KC fleet has moved to the civilian grade jet fuel called Jet A. So far no issues with this fuel. The Apache is not a refuelable aircraftthat Im aware of. At least I dont have procedure to refuel it.Stress can be really intense but then it becomes routine and you learn to deal with it. My job is proof you can get bored of anything.Ill leave off with a vintage video of an SR!!!EDIT Damn i hate the formatting on reddit any advice here would be appreciated. ,Military,cpcwgee,10,t5_2qh8y

I am sure as a SME you understand that when you need MM rounds on a target an F doesnt compare to an A which was my whole point. The current A provides a better capability for killing some cave dweller than other modern jets in that role and given that we are continuing to fight cave dwellers and not China I am going to go with that.Im not stretching my credentials I never said I was a CAS expert.

No soldier saw it as their special precious little thing it did not affect their identity or manhood if you wore a combat jacket or camo. I understand pretending to be a vet or a soldier is wrong especially to gain something out of it but this entitlement coming from soldier has to stop this is just a witchhunt. I made a post the other day here if anyone knew a cheap place to get reliable combat shirts for lower prices so i could have  some rugged quality garb when hunting and was almost lynched because i dare to diminish something soldier identify with something only they should be allowed to wear. For fucks sake if you are not pretending to be a soldier and not trying to gain anything out of it you can wear whatever you want without a soldier throwing a bitchy hissyfit i know i will get down voted for this but really i see bums wearing clothes they get from military surplus and no soldier ever gets angry over this maybe its because Canadian soldiers have better common sense or they just dont feel their identity is threatened i dont know.

3704047,0,t3_32t41r,Duffelblogs success comes from manufacturing over the top sarcastic stories that are just plain funny. Though the message in them is real. Its no different than satire in kids caricatures.The military as a whole is a socialist meritocracy. Its curse and blessing for some. The overachieving officer depicted in the article speaks volumes of my generation and the generations reality entitlement dreams and hard work is halted by antiquated bureaucracy. In other words merit is not rewarded. Instead seniority is. It isnt a bad thing. Fortune companies hire employees based on achievement experience but seniority isnt on the top of list. If prospect employee has  years in their previous company its viewed as stale and stagnant despite any achievements they mark on their resume. Its the reality and the military works exactly like this.Most readers will think the article is there to jab at newly commissioned officers. I differ. The article is truly jabbing the militarys antiquated promotion system. If a branch of service only commissions the best officers into active duty then why isnt there more programs to distinguish them once they are in? An Army cadet with a maxed out OML score will earn the same title as a newly commissioned West Point graduate. Merit recognition ends once you pin on the rank. Every year officers commision into the military from colleges around the US military colleges state schools and even the ivy leagues yet there is still no way to distinguish themselves once they don the uniform.There is a reason the article says the followinggt  Letters to general officers and Congress describing the changes necessary to turn this sinking ship around were ignored.Its a sinking ship because those in command now and in the future will be the bottom  or as the article says mouthbreathers. To some its whatever. To others its scary.Either way just my .. Cheers.,Military,cqehiht,45,t5_2qh8y

4032062,0,t3_36nipo,  In Basic during Land Nav we were put into teams of four and when my team got to the first point another was right behind us. We saw we had the same points in the same order so we teamed up. Everything went fine until the third point.  I grew up in the mountains so Im very confident in my ability to read the terrain and compare it to a map. Im absolutely sure we are at the wrong post so I speak up. I take a guess at about where our point should be in relation to where we were which was about  meter away. One private from the other group and I go to that location to see if its there while the others stay put. Sure enough the right point is about where I thought it was.  Then while we were about to rejoin the group the other private and I got rocks and sticks thrown at us by a few privates that were hiding behind trees up and to the left of us. We were walking along a dry creek bed. We ignored them and I went to the rest of the group to share our find then heard PRIAAT KAALLL!!! fuck  One of the Drill Sergeants had seen what happened and was chewing out the three who were throwing shit. He yelled Are you in their group! Yes Drill Sergeant! Get off my range! But before we go he saw that one of the privates chin strap was hanging so he took the privates helmet off shoved him in the chest with it threw it about  meters made the private crawl and get it crawl back it took fucking forever and then kicked us off the range.  I dont remember the exact distances but I think we were only about  meters away from the start point but we had to walk over a kilometer to the east where the fire stop was then south about  meters then back west. The whole way there the one private who was John Wayning it was concocting a plan to get that Drill Sergeant in trouble because the Drill Sergeant hit him with the helmet. Im just walking behind them thinking This is it. My career is over before it even started because my teammates were stupid.  Sure enough when we get back from the direction of the firetrap the other Drill Sergeant immediately tells us to beat our faces. Then he goes down the line asking us what all happened and the first private did his best to sell his story. The second only admitted to throwing some leaves and stuff. The third would only say I didnt throw no rocks. No matter what the Drill Sergeant asked or said the only response was I didnt throw no rocks.  Then when the Drill Sergeant asked me what I did I said I was one of the ones being thrown at Drill Sergeant. Also I was about to muscle failure at this point actually beating my face while the other guys were alternating between sticking their dicks in the dirt or asses in the air. The Drill Sergeant asked the others if that was right they said yes then he told me to get up and go sit in the shade. I was fucking shocked! Holy shit Im not in trouble!  Well I had another shot of fear when the first Drill Sergeant checked in saw me sitting and drinking water while the others were still on their faces and yelled at me to get back with them but the second Drill Sergeant explained. So I keep sitting there listening to the Drill Sergeants going back and forth with each other and the privates particularly the John Wayne one when an SUV comes down the road and the first Drill Sergeant immediately bolts out to wave it down. The second Drill Sergeant then explains to the John Wayne private Well its your lucky day! You get to exercise the Commanders Open Door Policy!  Sure enough the Company Commander walks up and he seriously intently listens to this private tell his side of the story. I mean he used active listening and everything. Then at the end of it he says Well private Ive known these Drill Sergeants for  years. Ive barely even known you for less than  weeks. I trust them over you. Carry on Drills. If I recall correctly that private washed out.  Since I had demonstrated my experience with Land Nav the Drill Sergeants then assigned me to a group of female privates that had been struggling to find their first point. I got them  and the rest of the afternoon went just fine.,Military,crfvwuw,4,t5_2qh8y

4107420,0,t3_37of1a,This is ridiculous discrimination. If you look at our base pay as military members its significantly lower than our civilian counterparts in jobs of comparable responsibilities. Generally our income is estimated through a combination of allowances and the value of our benefits. This estimation is what represents our value as salaried workers. That amount X dollars accounts for all of our expenses. Just like civilians are paid X dollars for their expenses. Now imagine that I show up to a company for a new job. They ask me if I am married and have kids. I say that I am married and that shehe already works for the company. Now they tell me that the one with the higher position will get higher pay because they refuse to pay housing for both of us. I could sue for discrimination in this case. Lets take it one step further. When I show up to a new job they ask if I am married. I am. Now they choose to pay me less than a single employee doing the same work because they shouldnt have to pay for my housing because I have a spouse who brings in income that could cover that housing cost. That is an extremely clear case of discrimination. No matter how you look at it you cant give one person in a couple more than the other. Its discrimination!!!!!!,Military,crogz6j,7,t5_2qh8y

4122112,0,t1_crq4v2b,I performed fairly well as a Lance Corporal High PFT Expert Rifle blah blah blah.  The norm.  All I was doing was chasing a score.  Now if im Manpower HQMC I might see it a little differently and individual people dont matter as much as statistics do.  I need X amount of lance corporals within this MOS thats all based of TIG and is automatic however the bottleneck starts at Corporal where it is no longer given out for just a having a pulse. HQMC see it as now I need Y amount of corporals within this MOS so if I make the cutting score this then it allows Y amount of people to get promoted then I push it higher so others wont get it earlier than we need and thus causes the bottleneck or chasing.  Luckily the  community is where I am as well so I can speak a little better on this one.  I do believe that the s are the most fucked out of any other  when it comes to a cutting score based off the composite score.  Hell Ive seen it closed numerous times for both Corporal and Sergeant ranks to get promoted at all.  However weapons MOSs are a different ballgame altogether and usually get the short end of the stick unless youre a  which seems to stay constant with the s. What about Recon   Marsoc .  Their pick up rate is done at  or  all the way til Sergeant then they bottleneck hard for looking at SSgt.  They are a smaller group therefore they have more people competing and with more people competing the less HQMC can allow to be promoted.HQMC is where the business aspect of the Marine Corps comes to play and individuals regardless of ground pounder or not isnt as important in the grand scheme of things.,Military,crq599p,1,t5_2qh8y

Between needing to wait for the enemy to open fire on your first to not engaging someone who doesnt have a gun even if hes clearly tailing you and sending info on your position and movement.Back in Vietnam this was the biggest problem at times for our air force since many planes initially had missiles only. Those missiles were designed to engage targets at  or so miles and took awhile to lock on and launch almost worthless once the target gets closer. However the rules of engagement said that you couldnt engage until you had a visual confirmation on the target normally within two miles. Thats pretty much like giving people sniper rifles and telling them that they need to let the other guy with a knife get close enough to touch before you can attack. ROE have long been very important both for their ability to limit casualties in non combatants but also in their ability to let enemies walk right past our guys with impunity. Normally they get better after awhile once people learn the situation but that takes time and casualties to make happen.,Military,csa279d,3,t5_2qh8y

After the end of civil war it was the intention of Lincoln and the North to reunite the country.  Very few conditions were put upon the South as the intention was to smooth over any separatist ideologies. After all it wasnt just the Generals who betrayed the country it was every ablebodied man in the South that took up arms.  Instead of calling them all traitors we decided it was better for the country to welcome everyone back noharm nofoul.Was this the right decision?

If someone wants to be able to conceal carry on post then they must first get a military installation permit.  That could require a class at your own expense additional background checks which they do on you when you register your firearm on post anyway and a caveat that only active military members are authorized onpost carry.

4629318,0,t1_ctdtphk,gt the last thing we need is untrained military thinking they are vigilantes and stopping crimeHonestly my concern  and it extends to personal weapons on base as well  is that the military isnt untrained. Everyone except chaplains and doctors? I dunno gets at least rudimentary weapons training with the M in basic training. Hundreds of thousands more get more training ranging from USAF aircrew qualifying on the M to the extensive training that special operations gets and everything in between.However this is one of those cases where a little bit of knowledge is worse than no knowledge I fear. Security forces I hope get at least some training on response to firearmsrelated incidents in the CONUS law enforcement context  by that I mean protection of civilians deescalation legal use of lethal force in the US and so on. Other servicemembers with extensive weapons training are trained for combat situations not law enforcement situations.What happens when some shit goes down and before security forces can arrive a group of people decide to react and use their combat training? Most situations are much more complex than clearly labeled jihadist shouting Allahu Akhbar and spraying rounds. But when its a SSgt in base housing who has an alcoholfueled mental breakdown and holds his family hostage with a gun what happens when a few young combat controllers fresh off their first overseas duty decide theyre going to save the day go clear the house themselves and end up with a dead toddler and critically wounded kindergartener for their efforts?Brash decisions by servicemembers who believe they have the training to respond can escalate situations.There was a situation at DavisMonthan AFB shortly before I arrived there. A suspicious person was spotted covertly entering a dorm with an assault rifle it was phoned in to SF the base was put on lockdown for hours. Fueled by unnamed base sources local media reported that the gunman had fired six shots that the ambulance leaving the base was carrying someone critically wounded that the gunman was barricaded inside a room and that negotiations were ongoing.Turns out that there was no shooter no shots were fired no negotiations happened and the ambulance was carrying out a pregnant woman who started getting contractions during the incident. Rumor is that the gunman was an airman with extremely poor judgment carrying his squadrons illicit war trophy rifle around.Now we want to add a gaggle of heroic butterbar pilots with handguns to the mix? That could have escalated the situation from nonincident to top news story of the week real quick.Im undecided as to how to deal with recruiters and other servicemembers without SF protection. Naturally I see the concern and also the awkward intersection between state CCW laws and federal buildings. And it runs both ways theres certainly the instances of recruiters etc. with state CCW permits who could legally carry anywhere else but theres also plenty of recruiters in more restrictive may issue states and having the federal government intercede to grant sweeping CCW privileges they wouldnt otherwise have gets really icky really quickly.I guess my ideal would be to equip recruiters offices and similar places break glass in case of emergency Ms  some sort of setup where an M and ammunition is readily accessible in case of emergency but is sealed and breaking the seal triggers an investigation and disciplinary action if unjustified. Seems like a good compromise  enables recruiters to defend themselves in emergencies but prevents SSgt Swagg from NDing into a potential recruit while showing said potential recruit the cool gun she would get to carry if shed just sign right here on this dotted line.,Military,cte3hjz,4,t5_2qh8y

Then so many people assume that policies that would send our children to state universities and provide healthcare for everyone would be impossible ... and yet every single nation that leads us in education and healthcare systems does exactly that.Instead people are polarized on social issues and get hung up on the big scary Sword ... instead of focusing on closing tax loopholes for corporations that allow them to take billions in taxrefunds without paying out anything and shelter their funds in foreign tax havens. These same corporations that buy our politicians and influence our government with impunity. These same corporations that because of a deregulated market have moved their production overseas. Not to provide the American people with cheaper products but just to increase their own profit. And yet we sit around wondering why our middleclass is shrinking why kids come out of university unable to find jobs and crippled by staggering debt and how to pay our medical bills... But lets just keep voting corporate anuses into office that will just keep sucking on the teat of their billionaire funders.Or instead Ill take the Socialist who is a champion of the people and will fight to kick corporate influence out of elections.

I also understand the windsheatdust play a huge role.But ya its not stats either but the general eye can see The crashes in Afghanistan compared to Iraq losesshot down is still abysmally high dont you agree? As you said we dont know the total  of flyouts. But that shouldnt really be a variable here. Whats the connectioncorrelation to Crashes in Afghanistan compared to Iraq shoot downs? Why do the numbers lean so heavy to crash? After more reading and this thread and Id love an actual pilot to chime in. But my conclusions are the mountains wind and dust. More so the first two than the later. It almost seems like we took lessons from Iraq in avoiding fire but natural causesmother nature took over in Afghanistan.gtor maintainance issues on helo components wear and tearThis is another highly valuable answer. But also is a little jarring knowing we lose equipment and men due to spare parts not being available or quickly enough.. As you said things happen. War is hell combat is combat you cant predict just prepare.

I know that youre not allowed to apply for undergrad program in UC if you have bachelors from any of the UCs but not sure about online school. Let me get back to you on this.As far as trasferring your credits it really depends. UC Berkeley tends to not take alot of the credits from other institutions but the best way to find out will be contacting the department youre looking to apply for with your transcript. But for militarygovernment training I can tell you that were most likely NOT going to take them as transferable credits. Unless you have very highly technicalrigorous training that would fit into course description youre planning to take.If youre married student at Cal you have a very good support from the school. There is a University Family Housing in Albany CA. Im not sure if youre familiar with the area but Albany is a very quite and peaceful town about  min drive from Berkeley.

When it coincides with a child screaming or a car speeding in from a blind spot I just focus on the music to get my heart rate and breathing down.I cannot reccomend going to the chaplain enough. Please do it for the sake of you and yours.,Military,cyf7bfk,3,t5_2qh8y

If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying meme family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Neckbeardae which includes things from Bernie Sanders to copypasta to atheist shitposting.So your reasoning for calling an image macro a meme is because random people call the funny ones memes? Lets get cat gifs and thanking mr skeletal doot doot in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. An image macro is an image macro and a member of the dank meme family. But thats not what you said.

6880343,1,t1_d0w330k,gtNo it doesnt because these things are not conferred because they are white but because they have money.The opportunity to have money is what being white gives you.  Thanks for not reading a damn thing I wrote and instead continuing to lie about what I write.gt If you want to go down the path that there are more rich white people in this country you already answered that fallacy yourself in your last post this is solely because we are in a white majority country. That is all.A  Thats part of the point.B  Its by percentage.  White people are disproportionately rich which is the issue.  But youre just pretending that wasnt what the topic was and then lie about me saying it was.gtAlso being white does not mean well off or stable anything.No it makes one more likely to have such things at birth.gt White privilege implies whiteness is the reason for the privilege. I have demonstrated no such thing exists.No you havent.  You made unsupported claims that fail rather easily on cursory examination.Youre a liar.gtHow so? Prove it! I know you cant because youre making it up. Weve already answered why more white people are employed at those businesses...or to be more exact you answered this white majority country simply means more white people will be employed. This is a reflection of statistics not any privilege these people were not hired BECAUSE they are white and it was green that made that path easier.Disproportionate and its actually not hard to prove.  BLS statistics bitch.gtWhite privilege or white skin privilege is a term for societal privileges that benefit people identified as white in Western countriesThis contradicts your own previous definition of white privilege hahahahah! Do you even read your own sourcesNo it doesnt. youre officially too stupid to call a liar any longer.gtAnd there is nothing wrong with that disparity. Based on population stratification that disparity is fair. To be  in a work place would be heavily unfair and leave far more people unemployed. You dont care because youre apparently racist against white people.Literally no one is arguing that quit lying.gtActually its not at all. Here is an opportunity but white people cant apply. This is actual POC privilege because being POC grants access to these. This is exactly a counter argument to your assertion that white privilege exists at all.Youre insane and racist and a liar.gtIm not reading anotherSince you didnt bother to read one in the first place this is unsurprising.gtThe only half decent argument you have is that in the past there was discrimination so it was more difficult and thats a fair assessment. The answer to me is to give it time and let things balance naturally doing what you and your fellow lying activists do will only ultimately cause a backlash see trumps riseThis is just overtly racist.gtIm actually not sure. You apparently have never been to the south or if you did you just ignored everything that challenged your narrative. There are shit tons of poor white people there.Once again you decided to choose in advance people to compare rather than the group.You are lying.gtHeee since you dont know it the definition of racismActually no.  Thats not the definition of racism.  I actually posted a whole article about what racism means and you just decided to ignore it because that would mean that youd have to acknowledge your own racism.Youre a racist.  gtWhat are you talking about. Go ahead and explain how anything I said says anyone is inferior.Since the actual definition of racism is much broader than that as I demonstrated in a post you literally refused to read quit lying.gtFucking liar crybaby actual racistYouve literally made up claims on my behalf.  Your entire post is racist lying drivel.Let me break this down to youYoure a racist piece of shit.  Youre a misogynist I checked your posting history holy shit.  I can safely say that you havent a shred of intellectual honesty in you because you literally admit to refusing to read any citation I provide.  Youre a liar who has made up positions for me and continued with them.  And Im going to reiterate it  youre a racist.

Seriously I think this is this guys basic premise.  He is one of the Only cops and the military should have them. types.So keep that in mind.  He is likely married to someone.  In every relationship I have ever been in my partner looked to me for some level of protection from the realities of every day life.  Food security housing and protection from the dangers of real life.  These are traditional male roles in our society.I am sure this guy manages to bring home the artisnal mayo in his twitter feed he is lamenting the closing of a place that made mayonnaise and food.  Probably manages to fund part of the housing costs in the Big Apple due more to rent control.  But I am fairly certain that whoever sleeps with this man at night worries that if someone were to accost them on the street or to break into their home that they are basically screwed and will likely die because well he is less than self reliant.

Senior leadership can moan about not having the money to fix the morale problem but theres not enough money in the world to fix it unless the underlying problem is solved.Money isnt what the article is citing as the prime reason morale is low.

Well if someone is shooting at you with primitive antiaircraft cannons from World war  or something then yea that might be the case. But it will go down just like everything else if you hit it with a Stinger or Russian Igla. And if US ever goes to war with Russia or a state heavily supported by Russia there will be plenty of those Iglas and other missiles like that around.flying them in Afghanistan or against ISIS in Iraq is great because those guys dont have modern weapons to shoot back at you. You have the luxury to fly slow and low choosing your targets like you want. If you want to see how planes like that work against a modern enemy check out war in Ukraine. Ukrainians use SU which is more or less similar to A both of them have bodies made of Titanium with extra protection for the pilot and engines and both carry heavy weapons and guess what?? Ukrainians lost a whole bunch of their SUs in the first half year of fighting Russians were shooting them down left and right with Iglas and BUKs. here is some info on their losses   . Americans have not faced a modern enemy for a long time now so they are overconfident dont realise how easy it is to shoot down slow flying planes if the only enemies you face are some people with Turbans armed with Kalashnikovs. ,Military,d6g8h5z,7,t5_2qh8y

Pretty heavily. I had no intention of joining the military at that age. I was gonna join a band again and make it big. That or I was going to go off to college and than travel the world. Do something to fuck with the system. But seeing that plane strike it changed me. I looked at my dad and told him I was going to join and fight. I buckled down in school graduated early and two years later I was in boot camp. A year and some change after that I was in Afghanistan. Always remember never forget. I hope to god my children never have to witness a such a tragedy. ,Military,d7i9xsy,20,t5_2qh8y

We at one point had a range all to ourselves with a small group and out GMC said hey just load some mags and shoot take your time and work on your fundamentals.

9160347,0,t1_d8cwnk8,Since the above are posed as questions source I spent  years Air Force  years Navy and  years USPHS  Do they enlist and commit to a minimum number or years? No but technically neither do any other military officers other than what might be incurred as payback for education or PCS move or such. Officers are commissioned for an indefinite amount of time and the commission stays in effect until you either retire resign or request to leave active duty end of commitment. Do they go to a lengthy boot camp? Not lengthy but yes they do go to a basic boot camp. As for how strenuous it is my personal experience is that there is a distinct arc with Enlisted Boot Camp and Officer Candidate School being the most strenuous Officer Indoctrination School for already commissioned staff corps officers  in my case Navy being much less strenuous and the USPHS equivalent being equivalent to Navy OIS but shorter.  Do they live in barracks or govt housing? As officers vs enlisted its mostly optional even in the other services. They CAN live in government housing but not mandatory. The only time I was REQUIRED to live in government housingbarracks was as an enlisted airman in the Air Force even in the Navy as an officer it was optional. Times when I did live in government housing were when stationed overseas Navy and when at an isolated duty station USPHS.  Do they have to live wherever they are told to go? No .... but in this case I actually preferred my Air Force and Navy experience of receiving PCS orders than I did the USPHS experience. In the USPHS I had to search for and find a billet on my own ensure it met the USPHS billet requirements and deployment role then apply for it like a civilian would and then do paperwork to create orders. And PCS moves although not forced are definitely required if the officer ever expects to get promoted because it aint happening otherwise.  Can they quit ... yes. But I could also resign at any time as a Navy officer if I wanted to with the caveat that there were time restrictions and time on station requirements and such for processing the separation orders because officers although they may incur a service requirement for various reasons do not sign a contract the same as enlisted personnel do. The USPHS may abbreviate the time on a case by case basis but still has time on station requirements.  Do they earn money and receive ... benefits in the exact same way the military does? Yes USPHS officers earn money and receive housing and health benefits exactly the same way the military does. USPHS uses the Coast Guard pay and benefit system vs MyPay.,Military,d8d53k7,2,t5_2qh8y

10163524,0,t3_5lipnv,Most guys that get married are in the  year old age bracket and dont have much relationship experience. Imagine youre from a small town but then join the service and are surrounded by nothing but dudes. And then after about halfyear or maybe two you get to your first unit and find out that the guys that live in the barracks get fucked with the most by their chain of command. Its enough to drive you crazy. Good thing that cute girl you used to talk to or could never get in high school likes to chat with you on Facebook or Skype. How bout she come over and visit you? Maybe she found out how much cash you have in your pocket and that you now come with health and dental benefits. Or hell maybe you two actually love each other. You do know that if you get married the military will pay you extra and let you live off base right? Great deal for her too since shes young and theres no good jobs where shes from or maybe is finding out that college isnt all that great. She found herself a man who can actually provide plus she loves you. Too bad shes surrounded by so many single cute dudes. Podunk Anywhere USA her hometown doesnt have this many cute guys who are this nice to her. Its a shame youre always out of town and cant pay her as much attention as shed like.

Although mutilating corpses is very fucked up the mental strain that these special operations operators endure must be close to impossible to cope with if the operator attempts to feel sympathetic towards his enemy. I am not in the military but I have read extensively about wars throughout time and the over riding theme is that every front line soldier will become desensitized to emotion after any prolonged periods of combat.

You werent proven as a true soldierMarineAirmansailor etc until you had completed your school and were sent off to your first duty station.  You could even fail out and get sent home with no real penalties depending on the exact situation.  So while at school youre generally treated like a fucking kid no matter your age or world experience.  All of that is basically why I recommended the process I did.  From my experience at my tech school I would fully expect to get an immediate no and not hear any more.  However I was contacted by the USAFs OSI a couple months after my graduation of tech school in an investigation of abuses by those in charge of the barracks portion of the training environment.Once youre off at your first duty station yeah you generally get treated like a real human being depending on how much of an ass your command is and how much of a dirtbag you are,Military,dcs1hh0,2,t5_2qh8y

10538256,0,t3_5qufgb,Its been hard not to talk about politics these past few months and surprisingly as well as anecdotally Ive seen more debate about Trump and politics in the wardroom these past few weeks than ever this past decade which leads me to this post.This really is at best an interesting time in our countrys history. Institutions are being tested and it appears the military is no exemptionThe entire move to remove the CJCS and DNI is appalling not just from the perspective of this officer but from the perspective of an American citizen.As we here all know the DNI and CJCS are the representatives of the eyes ears and arms of the US government in foreign affairs. Decisions made at the top on national security issues are made with input from the military and intelligence so that the White House can be given information to make informed decisions. Whether the White House listens or not is immaterial to the fact that the instruments of American power are given a voice at the table.This just removed their permanent spot at the table to be called on an as needed basis. In what fucking world is US national security not in need of a military and IC input?Moreover for the guys who are wondering what impact this has on day to day military affairs consider this. While the Joint Chiefs dont have operational command of the military they are the direct representatives of each branch and the armed forces as a whole and have a lot of say in recommending strategy tactics and even briefing the President on what the fuck is going on day to day in the field.Whether youre a grunt on the ground in Afghanistan or a pilot in the air over Syria or a sailor on a WestPac you and your job  through the chain of command  gets represented by your service chief and thus the JCS and the CJCS who has direct access to the President.Issues with the ROE in OIR? Developments on the ground or at sea? The CJCS can give direct input recommendations and even push back on the POTUS own recommendations before disseminating orders down the chain.Removing them from being involved? Its not just the fact that a voice of the military is being silenced from inner circle discussions on issues of national security.No its not just the fact that the military wont be able to sit at the table and give our recommendations from our experience in the field on what to do or not to do.Its the fact that the military is being told that their opinion and expertise doesnt matter that decisions made at the top are to be carried out without input and that the military and IC will not be privy to inner circle discussions on how to conduct US affairs and that we should all shut up and follow orders blindly.Thats the concerning fucking part. We cant even get our voice in whether orders are feasible. Hell the more concerning part to me is that we cant even get our voice in on whether orders are even legal and lawfulThere wont be a voice at the table in uniform saying Mr. President bombing a town to intentionally kill the family members of suspected terrorists is immoral and unlawful anymore.And you know what? Normally this kind of stuff wouldnt even be as flag raising... if it werent for the fact that his chief propagandist strategist is now an inner circle of the National Security Council.In what fucking world is your political strategist and ideologue a guy who probably couldnt even get a basic security clearance more important on matters of national security than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Director of National Intelligence?As a squadron mate of mine put it last night... when your media chief and political party leaders are now inner circle decision makers and your generals and admirals are cut out were going down a very dark path indeed,Military,dd2mmef,1185,t5_2qh8y

In any case modern research seems to indicate that Japanese were more affright of Soviets than atomic bombs.  ps. Japanese were desperately seeking surrender for  months their only condition was that kokutai  Imperial institution and national polity would have to be preserved.  Potsdam Declaration required surrender without conditions.  Even after Hirohito made the personal decision to  surrender Japanese    intention was to continue the war if occupying forces planned to get rid of the emperor.

Maybe hes got a warrant and will go back to prison when the officer runs his name? Maybe the car is stolen? As an officer you dont know when you get there. All you know is you pull up with your lights on all of a sudden the driver climbs out kind of haphazardly due to the decline his vehicle is on holding a dark colored object at chest level with both hands. He made a split second decision that turned out to be wrong. I dont think I wouldve done the same having the benefit of reviewing the video several times from my couch but I can see why it happened.

11361354,0,t1_dfil1r4,This happened to me well not a month later but  day before.  This is confusing so bear with me....I got medically separated after deployment in .  I had reenlisted so I got severance pay of what was supposed to be k but in reality I only received just shy of k.  Then after a whole mess my discharge was deemed illegal and it was changed to full retirement due to combat insurance post privileges all that fun stuff.  But this was  years later Jan .  I was also entitled to CRSC payments back dated to Jan .By this time the VA had already recouped their k no biggie and I never got my backpay for CRSC which is only an extra mo but thats mo for  months so not chump change.  Called them repeatedly about every month or two until present day they tell me back pay was paid it wasnt.Fast forward to this past Sept.  Now Ive been fighting with them for  years at this point.  I get the aformentioned letter saying I have a hearing because I owe the VA  that they didnt recoup a decade ago and the hearing is the day after I got the letter.  Well the thing is and I just found this out in DEC not only did they take the money back once but they also applied my retro pay to the nonexistent debt in .I call DFAS the Army the VA and the goddamn IRS looking for anything that has these dollar amounts on it.  Im informed by the IRS that records are destroyed after  years BY LAW same for VA and DFAS.  I go into the meeting with a DAV rep on short notice and tell them not only do I not owe them money but they owe ME what totaled out to about k!  And the DAV lady who was awesome Caught the VA guy lying to me in the hearing and busted his ass on it and I know she was right because he got piiissssed and super defensive and backtracky I ask for proof of debt knowing they dont have it because its been destroyed again by law.  They say since I cant prove that I only got .k and not the k that their records show that the debt is going to be recouped beginning once the appeal process is done which I never started.  I was told I would hear from them in a month or  to start the appeals.  Well not only did I nit hear from them  months later they began taking almost half my check with NO WARNING and NO APPEAL THAT I WAS PROMISSED.Now Im  days into the audit that I requested that I was told would take  days and when I called last week they said another  days minimum.  So as it stands the VA has recouped the same money money I NEVER RECIEVED  times and is in the process of taking it back for the th time based on financial records that dont even exist.  Seriously fuck the VA.  And dont even get me started on their medical care.  They should be labeled a terrorist organization.,Military,dfjse2v,5,t5_2qh8y
